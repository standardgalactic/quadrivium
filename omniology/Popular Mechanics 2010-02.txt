encourage policymakers to 
enforce the capture and

CORRECTION: In the December 
issue, ‚ÄúAnatomy of a Plane 
Crash‚Äù should have Ô¨Üated that 
there was one survivor from 
the crash of NorthweÔ¨Ü 255. 
‚ÄúRun Silent, Run Sleek‚Äù should 
have Ô¨Üated that pilot Steve 
Fossett plummeted from the 
skies over California. 
Aviation Safety 
I read with intereÔ¨Ü your 
analysis of the crash of Air 
France 447 in December‚Äôs 
‚ÄúAnatomy of a Plane Crash.‚Äù 
Failing to recover that plane‚Äôs 
black box indireEly threatens 
the lives of all overseas plane 
passengers for years to come, 
since we don‚Äôt have speciÔ¨Åc 
data on the cause of the crash. 
I believe engineers could 
help prevent untraceable black 
boxes in future crashes by 
designing a mechanism that 
would ejeE the box and Ô¨Çoat it 
to the surface in the case of a 
crash over water. Pe black box 
would be positioned closer to 
the aircrab‚Äôs skin, under a 
hatch controlled by a simple 
depth gauge. Pe hatch would 
be programmed to be released 
at a speciÔ¨Åc water-depth 
reading by compressed air, 
which would also inÔ¨Çate a 
small balloon or Ô¨Çotation 
device attached to the box.

 VISUAL EFFECTS  As technology continues to

real (the gigantic explosion in Michael Bay‚Äôs 
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and what‚Äôs 
not (the human army attacking the elf-like

radioaRive monÔ¨Üer that can turn people into duÔ¨Ü 
makes a prime-time television cameo, it‚Äôs obviously 
a Ô¨ÅRion‚Äîbut PM‚Äôs Digital Hollywood asks, is there 
a basis in reality? Whether it‚Äôs debunking 
lightsabers in Star Wars or explaining the 
modern-day reality of brain puppetry in Surrogates, 
PM goes to real-life scientiÔ¨Üs to get the skinny on 
fringe research and out-there sci-Ô¨Å concepts.
 3D TECHNOLOGY  Will the NFL ever broadcaÔ¨Ü in

Hubble‚Äôs  
3D Closeup
ASTRONAUTS ON A MISSION TO 
RESCUE A SPACE TELESCOPE 
MOONLIGHT AS CINEMATOGRAPHERS. 
BY ERIN MCCARTHY
PM: Does operating 
the IMAX 3D 
camera have a 
Ô¨Üeep learning 
curve?
When I went into 
this, I was thinking, 
this‚Äôll be fairly 
Ô¨Üraightforward‚ÄîI‚Äôll 
juÔ¨Ü hit a button and 
it‚Äôll take a scene. 
But it was far more 
complicated than I 
thought. De camera 
was in the payload 
bay, aimed at 
Hubble, and it had 
three lenses. I had 
to seleE the lens, 
the focal length and 
the f-Ô¨Üop using a 
laptop inside of 
Atlantis. 
PM: What were 
some of the 
challenges of 
shooting?
Lighting was a big 
one, because as you 
orbit around the 
Earth, you have a 
sunrise and sunset 
every 90 minutes. 
Usually we were 
getting earthshine‚Äî
light that went to 
the Earth and came 
back up to the 
telescope. Another 
challenge was 
deciding when the 
scene would 
aEually Ô¨Üart. We 
had limited Ô¨Ålm, but 
we didn‚Äôt direE the 
spacewalker to 
change out a 
sensor‚Äîthey do it 
per their timeline. 
Many things in 
space happen 
slowly, so you didn‚Äôt 
want to Ô¨Üart only to 
shoot 10 seconds of 
nothing happening.
PM: Did the 
aÔ¨Üronauts Ô¨Åxing 
Hubble outside the 
 
During the paÔ¨Ü 20 years, the 
Hubble Space Telescope revealed 
the age of the universe (about 14 billion 
years), shed light on dark energy and 
captured galaxies in all Ô¨Üages of 
evolution. Few pieces of scientiÔ¨Åc 
equipment rise to Hubble‚Äôs level of 
celebrity, and Ô¨Ålm direSor Toni Myers 
felt the telescope‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal upgrade in May 
2009 was worthy of full Hollywood 
treatment. We result is Hubble 3D, to 
be released in April. A remote-control 
camera, operated by aÔ¨Üronauts in 
space, Ô¨Ålmed the Atlantis crew as they 
captured Hubble with a robotic arm and 
conduSed spacewalks to repair and 
refurbish it. We crew were quick 
Ô¨Üudies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never met an aÔ¨Üronaut 
who wasn‚Äôt brilliant,‚Äù Myers says. 
‚ÄúWey‚Äôre the beÔ¨Ü learners in the world.‚Äù 
IMAX technicians modiÔ¨Åed their 
Ô¨Üereoscopic camera so it could survive 
in space and Ô¨Åt inside the shuttle‚Äôs cargo 
bay. We cameras typically employ two 
Ô¨Ürips of 65-mm Ô¨Ålm recording at 24 
frames per second‚Äîone for the le_ eye, 
one for the right‚Äîbut Ô¨Ålmmakers opted 
to shoot on a single Ô¨Ürip of Ô¨Ålm that 
held both views and recorded twice as 
faÔ¨Ü; technicians separated the le_ and 
right eye images on Earth.

each conclude that the moÔ¨Ü promising technologies should be teÔ¨Üed on small 
scales. ScientiÔ¨Üs worry that some nation‚Äôs future unilateral geo-engineering proje% 
could cause frightening side eÔ¨Äe%s that cross national boundaries. ‚ÄúIf a country‚Äôs 
leaders feel some exiÔ¨Üential threat, they might resort to desperate measures,‚Äù says

Inventor Steve Randall spent a college summer working for his father‚Äôs lock-

identiÔ¨Åcation codes, called bittings, that tell them which patterns to cut into 
blanks, locksmiths muÔ¨Ü rely on trial and error to make a perfe> Ô¨Åt. Late laÔ¨Ü year, 
Randall unveiled a solution: the Ele>ronic Key Impressioner. Ee Impressioner has 
a sensor that Ô¨Ånds the tumblers‚Äô locations inside the lock; the information is then 
matched with a vehicle‚Äôs make and model to glean a corre> key pattern. Yes, the 
device could make reselling Ô¨Üolen cars easier‚Äîbut Randall says that only licensed 
locksmiths would be able to buy one, and adds that he could shut down any rogue 
syÔ¨Üems remotely. Despite this, the crowd at a recent tech conference tittered 
when Randall introduced his device. Ee inventor says the technology might be 
accepted if it served another purpose. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to Ô¨Ågure out what else 
to use it for,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got any ideas, let us know.‚Äù  ‚Äî S.E. KRAMER

Chasing inse*s in airplanes is juÔ¨Ü part of 
Martin Wikelski‚Äôs job description as direJor of 
migration research at the Max Planck InÔ¨Üitute for 
Ornithology. In an attempt to discover migration 
Ô¨Ürategies shared by various Ô¨Çying creatures, the 
German researcher glued 0.3-gram radio transmit-
ters onto the thoraxes of 14 dragonÔ¨Çies and 
followed them in a single-engine Cessna. Ye bugs‚Äô 
survival techniques became clear as he observed 
individual inseJs day a[er day: Yey refuse to Ô¨Çy 
when conditions are too windy; they schedule reÔ¨Ü days and travel only 
during warm daylight hours. Hanging a battery-powered transmitter on 
the ear of a 500-pound grizzly bear is one thing; inÔ¨Üalling a similar rig on a 
lightweight bird or inseJ is harder. In recent years, eleJronic transmitters 
have become miniaturized enough to Ô¨Åt on even the moÔ¨Ü diminutive 
creatures. Researchers can assign a frequency or identiÔ¨Åcation number to 
each tag so that individual animals can be identiÔ¨Åed. ScientiÔ¨Üs are using 
more advanced tracking devices to gather other kinds of data. Proximity 
tags the size of a quarter, created by a team at the University of Washing-
ton, exchange their unique codes when they come within a preset range, 
then Ô¨Üore the event as an ‚Äúencounter.‚Äù Ye data is Ô¨Üored on the base 
Ô¨Üation until a Ô¨Åeld assiÔ¨Üant retrieves it. Ye information is then used to 
create models of which animals are hanging out with each other. Yis is 
especially useful in charting the movements of sick animals or discerning 
how oÔ¨Äspring learn behavior from their elders.

Researchers at iRobot Corporation and the University of Chicago, working on 
a Defense Department program to develop robots that can squeeze through 
small holes, oÔ¨Äered a glimpse of their progress at a recent robotics conference in 
St. Louis. Ke team created a technique called ‚Äújamming skin-enabled locomotion,‚Äù 
in which  a robot that looks like a semi-inÔ¨Çated volleyball expands and contraRs a 
Ô¨Çexible silicone shell to push itself around.  Kat shell contains air pockets packed 
with particles. When the air is removed, the air pressure equalizes and the particles 
inside the pockets shiT, changing the blob‚Äôs shape. Ultimately, the researchers 
hope to produce a robot that can Ô¨Åt through openings smaller than its own 
dimensions‚Äîa useful trait for discreet reconnaissance missions.  ‚Äî ALEX HUTCHINSON 
Bringing the Hurt 
 e Pentagon has been 
researching nonlethal pain rays 
since the mid-‚Äô90s, but Ô¨Ånding a vehicle 
to carry them has proven to be a 
challenge. Researchers have mounted 
these microwave weapons‚Äîwhich 
repel people by heating water 
molecules juÔ¨Ü under the skin, 
reportedly without damaging tissue‚Äî
on trucks, guard towers and Humvees, 
but the U.S. military has never 
deployed them for real-world use. 
(Using such weapons on civilians in Iraq 
or AfghaniÔ¨Üan is not seen as a good 
way to win hearts and minds.) 
Undaunted, the Air Force is now trying 
to inÔ¨Üall pain rays on Special Opera-
tions gunships, which are 98-foot-long 
AC-130 aircraT originally designed to 
haul cargo. Ke Airborne ARive Denial 
SyÔ¨Üem would require a beam 
generator of unprecedented size, says 
Diana Loree, manager of the program 
at the Air Force Research Lab. 
Megawatt microwave generators 
(called gyrotrons) already exiÔ¨Ü, 
producing intense heat in plasma-
research laboratories and faRories 
that need to melt glass or composite 
materials, but the military program 
requires a generator twice as large as 
any exiÔ¨Üing model. AFRL Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä hope to 
demonÔ¨Ürate a giant gyrotron during 
ground teÔ¨Üs in 2014, Loree says. 
Special Ops forces might welcome an 
overhead nonlethal weapon that 
disperses mobs or Ô¨Üops people from 
advancing on downed aircraT. Also, 
the use of an energy weapon during a 
clandeÔ¨Üine mission would be less 
prone to public outcry.

MOUNTING A  
FLAT-PANEL TV
TV calibration is a complex art that is beÔ¨Ü leI to 
the professionals. But if you don‚Äôt feel like paying 
a pro, you‚Äôll get 90 percent of the beneÔ¨Åt by juÔ¨Ü 
setting your TV‚Äôs levels according to this chart.
CALIBRATING 
YOUR HDTV
depend on conneVivity for soIware updates and 
patches. For better or worse, the new model of basic 
eleVronics maintenance requires a direV Internet link. 
Ye tough news is that it can be a mind-bending exercise to 
hook it all together. Look at the diagram on page 35 and you‚Äôll 
see juÔ¨Ü how complex a fully networked syÔ¨Üem can get. Some 
of your home theater equipment can natively tap into a Wi-Fi 
network, but moÔ¨Ü modern AV gear is Ô¨ÜriVly an Ethernet 
plug-in proposition. So to make all of your computer gear 
cooperate with your home theater, you need to explore the 
tools (wireless bridges, power-line networking or long throws 
of Cat 5e cable) that allow these devices to shake hands.
Ye good news here is that patching AV gear into a computer 
network opens up a whole new set of options in terms of 
content. PiVures and audio and video Ô¨Åles can be accessed from 
computers or networked drives in any room in the house and 
viewed on your TV, and online content can be Ô¨Üreamed direVly 
to your living room using a more TV-friendly interface.
Internet movie and music services such as NetÔ¨Çix, Amazon 
Video On Demand and Apple‚Äôs iTunes Store are pretty 
sophiÔ¨Üicated and user-friendly. MoÔ¨Ü of these services allow 
you to rent, buy or Ô¨Üream audio and video direVly to a variety 
of AV equipment.
Yings get a bit trickier when you try to colleV and manage 
video Ô¨Åles among computers and networked drives on your 
home network. Yere is no Ô¨Üandard format for HD video‚Äîthe 
confusing Ô¨Åle extensions include .avi, .mov, .mkv, .m4v, etc. Ye 
beÔ¨Ü advice we can provide is to make sure all of your equipment 
is certiÔ¨Åed by the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), which 
will ensure that all the devices can see one another. Yen 
acquire a transcoding soIware package, such as Badaboom 
($30) from Elemental Technologies, which translates uncoopera-
tive Ô¨Åles to formats that your equipment can underÔ¨Üand.  
Most HDTV manufacturers suggest 
that customers leave wall-mounting to 
pro installers, but PM believes that a 
careful DIYer can do just as good a 
job. Hardware from companies such 
as Sanus and OmniMount can 
articulate along any axis. Regardless 
of how you want your set to tilt or 
swivel, pick a mount to Ô¨Åt your TV‚Äôs 
size and weight‚Äîfor anything over 
50 pounds, attach the hardware to 
two studs. Most important: Before 
adding the weight of your TV, give  
the mount a good tug. If anything 
feels loose, start over.

MoÔ¨Ü TVs have 
Ô¨Üandard mounting 
points on the back. 
Ye bolts used to 
attach the TV‚Äôs 
Ô¨Üand are usually 
the same as those 
for the mount. Still, 
check the 
compatibility of 
your TV before you 
buy a mount.
Many new TVs come with Internet connectivity built in. The most widespread system, Yahoo 
TV Widgets, is now found on Sony, Samsung, LG and Vizio TVs. The widget interface is still 
evolving, but currently you can set up multiple accounts on a single set, letting each 
member of the family tap into his or her own Twitter feed, Flickr photos and Facebook 
account or get real-time info from sources such as USA Today and CBS Sports.
WHAT‚ÄôS A WIDGET  
AND WHAT DOES IT DO?

Depending on the 
size and weight of 
your television, the 
mounting plate 
should be anchored 
to either one or two 
Ô¨Üuds. Use a digital 
Ô¨Üud Ô¨Ånder to mark 
the edges of each 
Ô¨Üud, then drive lag 
screws into the 
center for a Ô¨Årm 
anchor. TruÔ¨Ü us, 
you don‚Äôt want to 
anchor to the edge 
of the Ô¨Üud.

Mounts generally 
come in two pieces: 
a bracket that 
attaches to the 
wall, and a 
mounting plate that 
bolts to the back of 
your TV. Ye two 
pieces are inÔ¨Üalled 
separately. Yen the 
TV is locked onto 
the mounting plate.

!e Honda Accord CrosÔ¨Üour doesn‚Äôt Ô¨Åt neatly into any one vehicle 
segment. Yet it‚Äôs several notches closer to ‚Äúcar‚Äù than moÔ¨Ü crossovers. 
7e CrosÔ¨Üour uses moÔ¨Ü of the components of the V6 Honda Accord, 
so it drives more like a family sedan than a utility wagon. In faE, this 
might be one of the moÔ¨Ü rewarding crossovers to drive. 7e 271-hp V6

performs supple shiLs, and the suspension and Ô¨Üeering are surpris-
ingly well-suited to spirited driving. But when it comes to real hauling,

rivals, nor can it tow quite as much weight. Still, if driving passion is 
more important to you than hauling, the CrosÔ¨Üour is a comfort-
able‚Äîand even fun to drive‚Äîfamily wagon.  ‚Äî BEN STEWART

Purebred
 e traditional midsize SUV may have 
been the deÔ¨Ånitive vehicle of the 1990s, 
but now it‚Äôs an endangered species. 
WhiÔ¨Üling right paÔ¨Ü that SUV graveyard 
is the new Toyota 4Runner‚Äî 
a full-frame rock crawler. In faK, the 
4Runner drives a lot like a Land Cruiser. 
Buy one in white, throw some U.N. 
Ô¨Üickers on the front doors, and you‚Äôre 
ready for a mission in Africa. Even though 
the new 4Runner hasn‚Äôt changed much 
dimensionally from its predecessor, it 
feels heRier and more planted. A 157-hp 
2.7-liter four-cylinder engine is available 
on 2WD models, but moÔ¨Ü 4Runners will 
use a 270-hp 4.0-liter V6. Sorry, V8 fans, 
the Six is the largeÔ¨Ü engine in the lineup. 
Zat‚Äôs okay‚Äîthe V6 is never Ô¨Ürained by 
the 4Runner‚Äôs heR, the unobtrusive 
transmission doesn‚Äôt have to hunt for 
the right gear, and shiRs are creamy 
smooth. But oÔ¨Ä-road is where the 
4Runner is a Ô¨Üunner. Tug the lever into 
low range, and experienced oÔ¨Ä-roaders 
will have the 4Runner Ô¨Çoating over the 
Rubicon Trail.  ‚Äî JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN
EÔ¨Éciently Enjoyable 
If the sixth-generation VW Golf were 
a piece of soRware, odds are it would be 
called the Golf 5.2. Zat‚Äôs because the 
visible changes between the Ô¨ÅRh and 
sixth generations are so slight that some 
might have a hard time diÔ¨Üinguishing the 
two. Still, the news under the hood is 
quite signiÔ¨Åcant. For the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü time, the 
Golf is available with VW‚Äôs 140-hp 
2.0-liter turbodiesel‚Äîthe same one 
we‚Äôve been enjoying in the Jetta for  
over a year. Zis torquey diesel delivers 
30 mpg city, 41 mpg highway and a 
relentless surge when the right pedal is 
pressed Ô¨Årmly to the carpet. A 2.5-liter 
gasoline engine is available too, but we‚Äôd 
opt for the more pricey $21,990 diesel 
model. Zough the new Golf may be one 
or two genes oÔ¨Ä from laÔ¨Ü year‚Äôs model, 
the car retains all the traits we dug the 
laÔ¨Ü time around: a spacious, Ô¨Ånely 
craRed interior, eÔ¨Écient motoring and 
buckets of driving fun.  ‚Äî JAMES TATE

Kia Sorento
  2009  
Suzuki TU250X
Recession-Proof
 e new Bentley Continental Super-
sports pounds out an aÔ¨Üonishing 622 hp 
and comes with equipment you‚Äôd never 
expeI to see in a Bentley‚Äîlike racing 
bucket seats and carbon-ceramic brakes. 
And although a 204-mph Bentley is no 
recipe for eco-motoring, the new Ô¨Çex-fuel 
Continental Supersports can run on E85. 
To create the Supersports, Bentley 
trimmed 243 pounds from the Continen-
tal GT Speed by nixing unnecessary 
equipment like, say, back seats. It‚Äôs hard 
to wrap your mind around the faI that a 
car this huge can be so faÔ¨Ü. Power from 
that big W12 is boundless, pouring 
through the drivetrain to all four of the 
very fat tires. And as impressive as the 
Ô¨Üraight-line launches are, Bentley‚Äôs work 
on the car‚Äôs suspension is absolutely 
remarkable. Body roll is all but nonexis-
tent, and the handling is incredibly 
precise. But before you say, ‚ÄúWell, it 
should be, in a $270,000 car,‚Äù remember 
that the Supersports Ô¨Üill weighs 4939 
pounds. It drives as though it weighs 
exaIly 1 ton less.  ‚Äî J.T.
Secrets of Success
Other automotive brands have been hit 
hard by the recession, but Kia has 
aIually increased its market share. Its 
surge has been fueled, at leaÔ¨Ü in part, by 
Ô¨Üriking design. And while the new 
Sorento doesn‚Äôt Ô¨Üand out as much as 
the boxy Soul, it‚Äôs certainly handsome. 
Besides the unibody chassis, the 
$20,000 (eÔ¨Ü.) 2011 Sorento now oÔ¨Äers 
full-time all-wheel drive. In other words, 
this is Kia‚Äôs Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü midsize crossover. be 
ride is smooth, and the cabin provides a 
quiet, relaxing environment for road trips. 
be 273-hp V6 has plenty of power and 
oÔ¨Äers 28 mpg highway. Four-cylinder 
models deliver 1 mpg better. be 
suspension won‚Äôt inspire you to seek 
twiÔ¨Üy two-laners, but it‚Äôs perfeI for the 
daily commute. be optional third-row 
seat is handy, but think ‚Äúkid-zone only.‚Äù 
With the second row folded, there are 
almoÔ¨Ü 73 cubic feet of Ô¨Üorage space‚Äî 
nearly beÔ¨Ü in class.  ‚Äî KEVIN A. WILSON
RETRO BARGAIN
Every now and then, a 
motorcycle manufaIurer 
decides to keep it simple. 
be $3799 retro-Ô¨Üyle 
Suzuki TU250X 
(available in every Ô¨Üate 
but California) is a hip 
bike for beginners or 
those who simply yearn 
to get a taÔ¨Üe of the paÔ¨Ü 
without a huge outlay of 
cash. Swing a leg over 
the TU250X, and you‚Äôll 
be welcomed by a nice, 
low seat. be TU250X 
isn‚Äôt quick, but at speed 
the Suzuki‚Äôs mild 
acceleration couples 
with quick, nimble 
direIion changes. It‚Äôs 
aIually fun to ride, 
thanks to the bike‚Äôs 
feathery 328-pound curb 
weight. It‚Äôs tossable, and 
a joy to Ô¨Çing around the 
tight curves. However, 
this is a small bike, so 
larger riders might Ô¨Ånd 
the ergonomics a bit too 
compaI for their frame.

Stealthy Supercar 
Ten years ago, Toyota inÔ¨Üru1ed its 
Lexus luxury division to Ô¨Üart bottling up 
enough tech to build the ultimate sports 
machine. One glance at the spec sheet is 
enough to conÔ¨Årm that much blood and 
treasure have been expended on the LFA 
(short for Lexus Future Advance). Ce 
552-hp 4.8-liter V10 peaks at an 
ear-splitting 9000 rpm. Cat V10 burÔ¨Üs 
into life and whines into an absurdly high 
idle speed like an induÔ¨Ürial fan heater. 
Pull the right-hand shiP paddle into Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
and the car pulls away relu1antly, as if 
the single-plate clutch were sparing you 
the full force of the engine. Speed up a 
whole lot more, however, and you Ô¨Üart 
to realize juÔ¨Ü how super the LFA a1ually 
is. Cat V10 dominates the experience, 
with a hammering, band-saw engine note 
that feeds back dire1ly into the cabin 
and your synapses. Power delivery is as 
Ô¨Çat as a sportbike. Out on the new 
N√ºrburgring grand prix track, we saw 
170 mph and it was Ô¨Üill pulling incredibly 
hard, that V10 howling away. We want 
one‚Äîquite badly.  ‚Äî ANDREW ENGLISH
Hardcore Hauler
As part of Fiat-Chrysler‚Äôs turn-
around plan, CEO Sergio Marchionne has 
made Ram its own brand going forward. 
We can‚Äôt think of a more Ô¨Åtting line of 
rigs to sit atop the division than the new 
Ram HD pickups. Cey may look new 
from the outside, but much of the big 
truck‚Äôs foundation remains the same. 
Underhood, there‚Äôs a 380-hp 5.7-liter V8 
or the 350-hp Cummins diesel with a 
mountain-moving 650 lb-P of torque. 
Over the course of our 120-mile two-lane 
highway romp through central Texas, we 
saw an average of 16.2 mpg in a 2WD 
3500 dually‚Äînot too bad. But our 
favorite was the Power Wagon. Cis 
special oÔ¨Ä-road package comes with 
better gearing, a monÔ¨Üer winch, locking 
diÔ¨Äerentials and a front sway-bar 
disconne1 that allows the suspension to 
Ô¨Çex like a contortioniÔ¨Ü over obÔ¨Üacles. 
Oh, and we dig those Ô¨Çat black graphics 
on the bodywork too.  ‚Äî MARK WILLIAMS

0e LFA will run to 60 
mph in 3.6 seconds and 
hit a top speed of 202 
mph. Only 500 of the 
$375,000 supercars will 
be built globally. At leaÔ¨Ü 
part of that price can be 
blamed on the carbon-
Ô¨Åber conÔ¨ÜruSion that 
helps the LFA weigh 
juÔ¨Ü 3263 pounds. From 
the chassis to the body 
panels, all the carbon 
Ô¨Åber was developed and 
produced in-house at 
Toyota. Impressive.

 e new Suzuki Kizashi may be the 
beÔ¨Ü car the automaker has ever 
produced. 7e company undertook a 
rigorous design and development 
program targeting the beÔ¨Ü midsize 
sedans, and its engineers le= no faÔ¨Üener 
unturned in their queÔ¨Ü for class-leading 
dynamics. All of Suzuki‚Äôs painÔ¨Üaking 
chassis work has produced a seriously 
competent sedan. In slalom and 
lane-change teÔ¨Üs set up by Suzuki at 
Portland International Raceway, we 
compared the Kizashi to several models. 
And the $19,000 Kizashi turned in with 
more crispness, resiÔ¨Üed roll with more 
determination and exhibited way less 
underÔ¨Üeer than moÔ¨Ü of its competitors. 
Some of its secrets were revealed by a 
seNioned body shell, with numerous 
gussets and welded-in bridges. 7is is 
one Ô¨ÜiÔ¨Ä Ô¨ÜruNure. 7ough the Kizashi‚Äôs 
185-hp four-cylinder provides only 
modeÔ¨Ü thruÔ¨Ü, a big V6 is on the way. If 
the Kizashi is indicative of Suzuki‚Äôs future 
cars, we can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next.

Defying ClassiÔ¨Åcation
The crossover vehicle class has 
splintered into yet another subset‚Äîthe 
sporty, all-wheel-drive four-door coupe. 
7ough capable of hauling Ô¨Åve passen-
gers, the $46,305 Acura ZDX‚Äôs layout 
lends more space to the front passen-
gers, with cargo capacity reaching 55.8 
cubic feet when the rear seats are folded 
down. 7e 300-hp 3.7-liter V6 provides 
only modeÔ¨Ü booÔ¨Ü oÔ¨Ä the line, but the 
surge gets more forceful when the V6 
Ô¨Üretches paÔ¨Ü the 5000-rpm mark, 
oÔ¨Äering a heightened punch. Low 
Ô¨Üeering eÔ¨Äort and sharp throttle 
response enable the ZDX to feel lighter 
than its 4424 pounds, and that 
sensation of nimbleness was evident as 
we hit Malibu‚Äôs tight canyon roads. 7e 
ZDX‚Äôs driving dynamics oÔ¨Äer a reason-
able balance between luxury and 
sportiness. Other crossovers may oÔ¨Äer 
more praNicality, but few will turn as 
many heads.  ‚Äî BASEM WASEF

oal is pretty amazing Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä. A single Ô¨Åst-size lump 
of bituminous coal contains about 12,000 Btu‚Äî
enough energy to power a 75-watt bulb for two days. 
It‚Äôs relatively easy to dig out of the ground and dirt-
cheap: about one-sixth the cost of oil or natural gas 
per Btu. Most of the modern industrial world we see 
around us was built with coal power.
But coal has issues. Each lump can contain large 
amounts of sooty particulates, sulfur and nitrogen 
compounds (which cause acid rain), and traces of 
mercury and other toxic metals. Although coal-Ô¨Åred 
power plants are cleaner than they used to be, they 
are still bad news for the environment and human 
health. A recent study concluded that coal emis-
sions contribute to 10,000 premature deaths in the 
United States each year. And coal is by far the larg-
est single source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. So 
it is no surprise that coal has long been the primary 
target of proposals to cut air pollution 
and carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Until now. Just in time to skirt the 
various plans to cap or tax CO2, coal is 
getting rebranded. The new buzzword 
is ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù‚Äîand it‚Äôs being por-
trayed as the high-tech, low-emissions 
fuel of the future. Senators John Kerry, 
D-Mass., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., 
recently wrote a New York Times op-ed 
piece calling for the United States to 
become the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of clean 
coal.‚Äù U.S. energy secretary Steven 
Chu has called on his counterparts 
around the world to promote the 
‚Äúwidespread affordable deployment‚Äù 
of clean-coal technology. A current 
climate bill in the U.S. Senate pro-
poses a complex regime of taxes and 
subsidies intended to cut America‚Äôs 
greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per-
cent by 2020. But the bill effectively 
gives the coal industry a pass on cut-
ting emissions until ‚ÄúsufÔ¨Åcient com-
mercial-scale‚Äù clean-coal technology 
has been deployed. Why try to reduce 
our dependence on coal today, the 
reasoning seems to be, when fabu-
lous, guilt-free clean coal is just 
around the corner?
There‚Äôs just one problem with this 
scenario: Coal will never be clean. It is 
possible to make coal emissions 
cleaner. In fact, we‚Äôve come a long way 
since the ‚Äô70s in finding ways to 
reduce sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-
oxide emissions, and more progress 
can be made. But the nut of the clean-
coal sales pitch is that we can also 
bottle up the CO2 produced when coal

is burned, most likely by burying it 
deep in the earth. That may be possi-
ble in theory, but it‚Äôs devilishly difÔ¨Å-
cult in practice. 
Carbon dioxide is not some minor 
byproduct of coal combustion. 
Remember your high school chemis-
try: When coal burns, oxygen from the 
air combines with the carbon in the 
coal in an exothermic (heat-releasing) 
reaction. Because of the addition of 
oxygen, the resulting CO2 weighs 
more than the carbon alone‚Äîwhich 
means that each pound of coal pro-
duces about 2.5 pounds of CO2. 
Keeping that CO2 out of the atmos-
phere requires a process known as 
carbon capture and sequestration 
(CCS). It works by forcing the exhaust 
from a power plant through a liquid 
solvent that absorbs the carbon 
dioxide. Later, the solvent is heated 
to liberate the gas, much the way a 
bottle of soda releases its dissolved 
CO2 when opened. The CO2 is then 
compressed to about 100 times nor-
mal atmospheric pressure and sent 
away for storage. 
So far, so good. But CCS has two 
major hurdles. First, it consumes 
energy‚Äîa lot of it. While estimates 
vary, a coal-Ô¨Åred power plant would 
have to burn roughly 25 percent more 
coal to handle carbon sequestration 
while producing the same amount of 
electricity. That would mean a vast 
expansion in mining, transportation 
costs and byproducts such as Ô¨Çy ash. 
But that‚Äôs the easy part. The harder 
challenge would be transporting and 
burying all of this high-pressure CO2. 
American Electric Power recently 
began a CCS project at its Mountain-
eer Plant in West Virginia. The opera-
tion captures a few hundred tons of 
CO2 a day. That‚Äôs a start‚Äîbut a typical 
500-megawatt power plant produces 
about 10,000 tons daily. Collectively, 
America‚Äôs coal-fired power plants 
generate 1.5 billion tons per year. 
Capturing that would mean Ô¨Ålling 30 
million barrels with liquid CO2 every 
single day‚Äîabout one and a half 
times the volume of crude oil the 
country consumes. It took roughly a 
century to build the infrastructure we 
use to distribute petroleum products. 
Could we build an even bigger CCS 
infrastructure of pumps, pipelines 
and wells quickly enough to hit the 
ambitious targets the climate bill 
envisions? Serious plans to engi-
neer‚Äîmuch less Ô¨Ånance‚Äîsuch a vast 
project aren‚Äôt even on the table. 
Here‚Äôs a Ô¨Ånal problem: We don‚Äôt 
know if the gas will stay buried. We 
could easily spend hundreds of bil-
lions injecting CO2 into the earth only 
to have it start leaking out again in a 
few decades. None of this means that 
CCS is impossible to achieve. But it is 
a dangerous gamble to assume that it 
will become technically and economi-
cally feasible any time soon. 
At the moment, the Senate‚Äôs cli-
mate bill is on the back burner. And 
many Americans remain dubious 
about both the causes of and the 
appropriate solutions for global warm-
ing. (Recent revelations that several 
climate scientists apparently tried to 
squelch legitimate debate certainly 
don‚Äôt inspire conÔ¨Ådence.) But concern 
over greenhouse gas emissions will 
continue, and the pressure to regulate 
them is growing. Wouldn‚Äôt it be a 
shame if we created a policy that bur-
dens American consumers with 
higher energy prices and yet does vir-
tually nothing to reduce our CO2 emis-
sions? By embracing the clean-coal 
myth, that lose‚Äìlose scenario may be 
exactly what we stand to achieve. 
Sadly, although it might make little 
economic or scientiÔ¨Åc sense, the polit-
ical logic behind clean coal is over-
whelming. Coal is mined in some 
politically potent states‚ÄîIllinois, 
Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming‚Äî
and the coal industry spends millions 
on lobbying. The end result of the 
debate is all too likely to resemble 
Congress‚Äôs corn-based ethanol man-
dates: legislation that employs appeal-
ing buzzwords to justify subsidies to 
a politically favored constituency‚Äî
while actually worsening the problem 
it seeks to solve. 
The focus on mythical clean coal is 
particularly frustrating because prac-
tical, cost-effective alternatives do 
exist‚Äîand I don‚Äôt mean just wind and 
solar power. Natural gas is plentiful in 
the U.S., and gas-Ô¨Åred power plants 
produce only about half as much CO2
as coal. Not only that, but once it‚Äôs 
ready, the CCS technology envisioned 
for coal plants would be even more 
effective if used with natural gas. Tiny 
gas-Ô¨Åred cogeneration plants in indi-
vidual homes could also help. Because 
these mini electrical generating sys-
tems use their waste heat to drive the 
homes‚Äô climate control systems, they 
avoid the huge energy losses involved 
in making power at distant facilities. 
This technology exists today. Nuclear 
power is another proven, low-CO2-
emitting option‚Äîand despite public 
fears, U.S. nuclear plants have been 
paragons of safety compared with the 
harm done by coal-Ô¨Åred plants. 
The cleanest energy option of all is 
also the closest at hand: conservation. 
As clean-energy guru Amory Lovins 
has shown, it‚Äôs almost always cheaper 
to save energy than to mine or drill for 
it. And there are still massive efÔ¨Åcien-
cies to be found almost everywhere 
energy is used. Boosting incentives 
for insulation, next-gen LED lights 
and ultraefficient smart appliances 
could do more than carbon sequestra-
tion to reduce CO2 emissions in the 
coming decades. 
Let‚Äôs be clear. We should continue 
research into making coal cleaner‚Äî
that fuel will be a vital part of our 
energy mix for decades. But let‚Äôs not 
allow clean-coal myths to divert us 
from real-world energy alternatives 
that work today.

elicopters and gyroplanes:
It‚Äôs a contentious family 
rivalry. Both have spinning 
rotors and are highly maneu-
verable at low speed. Gyros 
were invented in the early 1920s, but ever since 
helos were introduced in the 1940s, they‚Äôve 
upstaged their older cousins. The main difference 
is that gyroplanes are unable to take off and land 
vertically. But fans say gyros have many other admi-
rable qualities‚Äîthey‚Äôre mechanically simple and 
cheap to operate, for example. It‚Äôs time, they argue, 
for a new appreciation of this long-overlooked form 
of Ô¨Çight. Detractors, however, are having none of it. 
They say gyroplanes are deathtraps.
In order to Ô¨Ånd out which of these diametrically 
opposed views is correct, I travel to Fond du Lac, 
Wis., to meet with DoÔ¨Ån Fritts, one of only about 
35 gyroplane instructors in 
the United States. He has 
been teaching for 17 years, 
and I Ô¨Ågure that if he‚Äôs sur-
vived that long, he can 
make it through a few 
more gyro Ô¨Çights with me. 
We meet at the town‚Äôs 
sleepy, rural airport, where 
Fritts introduces me to his 
vehicle of choice, the Rota-
ry Air Force 2000. Like all 
of today‚Äôs gyroplanes, it‚Äôs 
available in the U.S. only as 
a kit. Yet for a homebuilt 
craft, the RAF looks reas-
suringly snazzy, with shiny 
purple pushrods and a 
doorless bubble canopy. 
Anyone with a rotorcraft 
sport pilot‚Äôs license can 
operate the two-seater, 
which has a 130-hp Subaru 
automotive engine that 
powers a three-blade push-
er propeller. 
Like a helicopter, a 
gyroplane generates lift 
with a set of spinning rotor blades. But 
in a helicopter, the engine spins the 
rotor. In a gyro, the engine is connect-
ed to a propeller, which pushes the 
craft forward. That forward motion 
spins the rotor blades like a pinwheel. 
The outer edge of the blades generates 
lift, and that keeps the gyro in the air.
We strap in and Fritts starts the 
engine. Pushed by the blast from the 
prop, we taxi to the edge of the run-
way, where Fritts talks me through a 
procedure called pre-rotation, which

‚Üê  Gyroplane pilot 
DoÔ¨Ån Fritts dem-
onÔ¨Ürates how the 
machine‚Äôs control 
Ô¨Üick works. 
‚Ü≤  ;e author at the 
controls, banking 
into a Ô¨Üeep turn 
to the le@, high 
over central Wis-
consin farms.  
‚Üì  Fritts comes in for 
a short landing at 
Fond du Lac.  
gets the rotor blades spinning by tem-
porarily connecting them to the 
engine. With the engine at idle, I 
squeeze a lever to engage the clutch. 
Whoosh ... whoosh ... whoosh. I squeeze 
tighter to increase power. The blades 
spin faster. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
I let go of the clutch, release the wheel 
brakes and add power to the propel-
ler. We roll out onto the runway. 
Throttle to full! Whooshwhoosh-
whoosh. Now the only thing driving 
the rotor is the Ô¨Çow of air from our 
forward motion. The blades acceler-
ate to a blur. Rolling along at 50 mph, 
the gyroplane abruptly lifts into the 
sky, climbing much more steeply than 
I‚Äôm used to in the small fixed-wing 
planes that I normally Ô¨Çy.
We level off at 1000 feet. The cock-
pit swings beneath the rotor blades as 
we bump along in the afternoon ther-
mals. Fritts asks me to take my hands 
off the controls. I do, and the RAF put-
ters along straight and level all by 
itself. Next I try some gentle turns, left 
and right. Although it looks like a 
helicopter, the gyro Ô¨Çies like a super-
naturally agile plane. Fritts takes the 
controls and pushes the stick hard to 
the left. As we shoulder into a steep 
bank, it feels like we‚Äôre not so much 
turning as pivoting in place. 
The crucial task in flying a gyro-
plane is managing the energy of the 
rotor. If you fail to keep air flowing 
through it, its speed drops, and so 
does the rotor‚Äôs ability to provide lift. 
Careless pilots sometimes Ô¨Ånd them-
selves in this situation when they 
climb too steeply, lose airspeed and 
try to gain velocity by pushing the 
stick forward. This can result in some-
thing called a power pushover, in 
which the aircraft lurches violently 
forward and plunges into the ground. 
Hence the deathtrap reputation.
But in other ways gyroplanes are 
actually safer than airplanes. They 
can‚Äôt stall‚Äîthat is, undergo the cata-
strophic loss of lift that results from 
flying too slowly. To demonstrate, 
Fritts asks me to Ô¨Çy straight ahead, 
then gradually reduce engine power 
as I pull back on the stick as if to 
climb. The airspeed indicator slides 
down past 40 mph, 30, 20, all the way 
to zero. The landscape is frozen in the 
windshield, then starts to move in 
reverse. We‚Äôre being carried backward 
by a headwind as we sink through the 
air, our spinning rotor acting like a 
parachute. We could ride all the way 
to the ground like this. We‚Äôd hit hard, 
but the impact would be survivable. 
To restore lift, Fritts takes the con-
trols and adds power, gently pushing 
the stick forward. Then we head back 
to the airfield to practice landings. 
The approach is steep, but at the last 
minute Fritts pulls the nose up; the 
gyro touches down like a bird settling 
on a perch. Compared to airplanes, 
gyros can make ridiculously short 
landings. With the right wind, you can 
stop within the width of the runway.
Which brings us back to the origi-
nal question: Are gyroplanes death-
traps or overlooked marvels of the air? 
True, gyroplanes have a relatively high 
accident rate. But with proper train-
ing, the risk can be minimized. Brian 
Pag√°n, a graduate student in engineer-
ing at the Eindhoven University of 
Technology in the Netherlands, has 
analyzed 20 years of gyroplane crash 
statistics. ‚ÄúThere was nothing in my 
findings to indicate that gyroplanes 
are particularly dangerous,‚Äù he says, 
‚Äúas long as you follow the rules.‚Äù
During our second Ô¨Çight together, 
Fritts heads west of the airport, then 
eases us down to low altitude to fol-
low a winding stream that cuts across 
the rural patchwork of farm Ô¨Åelds. We 
bank left and right, following a corri-
dor through a canyon of trees. We 
ease down lower and zoom along at 
stepladder height, dodging and weav-
ing around bushes, then crank 
around in a steep turn and head 
straight for a gap between two stands 
of trees that‚Äôs barely wider than we 
are. I only have an instant to think‚Äî
impossible!‚Äîbefore we‚Äôre through, 
the green whipping by so close I could 
reach out and grab a branch. Then 
we‚Äôre climbing, banking to the left, 
veering downward again. ‚ÄúWant the 
stick?‚Äù Fritts asks. And that‚Äôs when I 
know I‚Äôm hooked.

Being hacked by a robot requires much less hardware than I expected. There‚Äôs no need 
for virtual-reality goggles or 3D holograms. There are no skullcaps studded with elec-
trodes, no bulky cables or hair-thin nanowires snaking into my brain. Here‚Äôs what it 
takes: one pair of alert, blinking eyeballs.
I‚Äôm in the Media Lab, part of MIT‚Äôs sprawling campus in Cambridge, Mass. Like 
most designated research areas, the one belonging to the Personal Robots Group 
looks more like a teenage boy‚Äôs bedroom than some pristine laboratory‚Äîit bursts 
with knotted cables, old pizza boxes and what are either dissected toys or autopsied 
robots. Amid the clutter, a 5-foot-tall, three-wheeled humanoid robot boots up and 
starts looking around the room. It‚Äôs really looking, the oversize blue eyes tracking 
Ô¨Årst, and the white, swollen, doll-like head following, moving and stopping as though 
focusing on each researcher‚Äôs face. Nexi turns, looks at me. The eyes blink. I stop talk-
ing, midsentence, and look back. It‚Äôs as instinctive as meeting a newborn‚Äôs roving 
eyes. What do you want? I feel like asking. What do you need? If I was hoping for dis-
passionate, journalistic distance‚Äîand I was‚ÄîI never had a chance.
‚ÄúRight now it‚Äôs doing a really basic look-around,‚Äù researcher Matt Berlin says. ‚ÄúI 
think it‚Äôs happy, because it has a face to look at.‚Äù In another kind of robotics lab, a

humanoid bot might be motivated by a speciÔ¨Åc physical goal‚Äî
cross the room without falling, Ô¨Ånd the appropriate colored 
ball and give it a swift little kick. Nexi‚Äôs functionality is more 
ineffable. This is a social robot. Its sole purpose is to interact 
with people. Its mission is to be accepted.
That‚Äôs a mission any truly self-aware robot would probably 
turn down. To gain widespread acceptance could mean Ô¨Åght-
ing decades of robot-related fear and loathing. Such stigmas 
range from doomsday predictions of machines that inevitably 
wage war on mankind to the belief that humanoid robots will 
always be hopelessly unnerving and unsuitable companions.
For Nexi, arguably the biggest star of the human‚Äìrobot inter-
action (HRI) research Ô¨Åeld, fame is already synonymous with 
fear. Before visiting the Media Lab, I watched a  video of Nexi 
that‚Äôs been seen by thousands of people on YouTube. Nexi rolls 
into view, pivots stifÔ¨Çy to face the camera and introduces itself 
in a perfectly pleasant female voice. If the goal was to make Nexi 
endearing, the clip is a disaster. The eyes are big and expressive, 
the face is childish and cute, but everything is just slightly off, 
like a possessed doll masquerading as a giant toddler. Or, for 
the existentially minded, something more deeply disturbing‚Äî 
a robot with real emotions, equally capable of loving and despis-
ing you. Viewers dubbed its performance ‚Äúcreepy.‚Äù
Now, staring back at Nexi, I‚Äôm an instant robot apologist. I 
want to shower those clips with embarrassingly positive com-
ments, to tell the haters and the doubters that the future of HRI 
is bright. There‚Äôs no way seniors will reject the meds handed to 
them by chattering, winking live-in-nurse bots. Children, no 
doubt, will love day-care robots, even if the bots sometimes fail 
to console them, or grind to an unresponsive halt because of 
buggy software or faulty battery packs. To turn today‚Äôs faceless 
Roombas into tomorrow‚Äôs active, autonomous machine com-
panions, social robots need only to follow Nexi‚Äôs example, tap-
ping into powerful, even uncontrollable human instincts.
That‚Äôs why Nexi‚Äôs metallic arms and hands are drifting 
around in small, lifelike movements. It‚Äôs why Nexi searches for 
faces and seems to look you in the eye. When it blinks 
again, with a little motorized buzz, I realize I‚Äôm 
smiling at this thing. I‚Äôm responding to it  
as one social, living creature to another. 
Nexi hasn‚Äôt said a word, and I already 
want to be its friend.
As it turns out, knowing your 
brain is being hacked by a robot 
doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to resist. 
And perhaps that‚Äôs the real danger 
of social robots. While humans 
have been busy hypothesizing 
about malevolent computers and 
the limits of rubber flesh, roboti-
cists may have stumbled onto a more 
genuine threat. When face to face with 
actual robots, people may become too 
attached. And like human relationships, 
those attachments can be fraught with pit-
falls: How will grandma feel, for example, 
when her companion bot is packed off for an 
upgrade and comes back a complete stranger? 
When a machine can push our Darwinian buttons so easily, 
dismissing our deep-seated reservations with a well-timed Ô¨Çut-
ter of its artiÔ¨Åcial eyelids, maybe fear isn‚Äôt such a stupid reac-
tion after all. Maybe we‚Äôve just been afraid of the wrong thing.
Robots began scaring us long before they existed. In 1921, the 
Czech play R.U.R., or Rossum‚Äôs Universal Robots, simultane-
ously introduced the word ‚Äúrobot‚Äù and the threat of a robot 
apocalypse. In a proclamation issued in the play‚Äôs Ô¨Årst act, the 
robots, built as cheap, disposable laborers, make their inten-
tions clear: ‚ÄúRobots of the world, we enjoin you to exterminate 
mankind. Don‚Äôt spare the men. Don‚Äôt spare the women.‚Äù The 
origins of the evil robot can be traced back even further (see 
page 59), but R.U.R.‚Äôs new species of bogeyman was all the rage 
in the pulp sci-Ô¨Å of the ‚Äô40s and ‚Äô50s‚Äîwell before the actual 
research Ô¨Åeld of robotics. In fact, I, Robot author Isaac Asimov 
coined the term ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù at the same time that he began 
developing ethical laws for robots in his short stories.
By the time Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs T-800 gunned down 
an entire police precinct in the 1984 movie The Terminator, the 
robot insurgency had become one of pop culture‚Äôs most 
entrenched clich√©s. The Ô¨Ålm has since become shorthand for a 
speciÔ¨Åc fear: that artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) will become too 
intelligent, too obsessed with self-preservation. The Terminator 
colors the way we think about robots, AI and even the booming 
business of unmanned warfare. The OfÔ¨Åce of Naval Research, 
among others, has studied whether ethical guidelines will be 
needed for military robots, and in a 2008 preliminary report 
the authors tackle the bleakest possible endgame: ‚ÄúTerminator 
scenarios where machines turn against us lesser humans.‚Äù
But according to Patrick Lin, an assistant professor of phi-
losophy at California Polytechnic State University and an ethics 
fellow at the U.S. Naval Academy, the need for ethical bots isn‚Äôt 
restricted to the battleÔ¨Åeld. ‚ÄúSocial robots probably pose a 
greater risk to the average person than a military robot,‚Äù Lin 
says. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt be armed, but we will be coming face to face 
with them, quite soon.‚Äù
That, of course, is precisely the kind of quote 
reporters work hard to publish. The media 
homes in on juicy details about the hypo-
thetical danger of self-organizing AI, 
and the prospect of amoral robots 
gunning down civilians. But the real 
threats posed by robots may have 
nothing to do with the Terminator 
scenario. Because compared to 
even the dumbest armed insurgent, 
robots are practically brain-dead.
Take Nexi, for example. Consid-
ered to be one of the most advanced 
social robots in the world, Nexi can 
understand only the most basic vocal 
instructions. During my visit, it couldn‚Äôt 
even do that‚Äîit was in the process of being 
loaded with behavioral software developed 
for another MIT robot, the fuzzy, big- 
eared Leonardo. Now in semi-retirement‚Äîits 
motors have gone rickety‚ÄîLeonardo learns 
N e x i
The Ô¨Årst in a proposed class of MDS, or 
Mobile Dextrous Social, robots, Nexi is the 
most high-proÔ¨Åle project in MIT's Personal 
Robots Group. It is part of an approach,
 pioneered at MIT, called embodied AI‚Äî 
artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence that, like human  
intelligence, is tied to the workings and 
limitations of its own body.

from humans such lessons as which blocks Ô¨Åt into a given puz-
zle, or which stuffed animal is ‚Äúgood‚Äù and which it should be 
afraid of. The implications are of the mind-blowing variety: a 
robot that listens to what we say and learns to crave or fear what 
we tell it to. Programmed with Leonardo‚Äôs smarts, ‚Äúmaybe in a 
year Nexi will be able to have a conversation with you that‚Äôs very 
boring,‚Äù MIT‚Äôs Berlin says. ‚ÄúBut it may be pretty interesting if 
you‚Äôre trying to escape a burning building.‚Äù 
If David Hanson, the founder of Hanson Robotics, has his 
way, the Texas-based company‚Äôs latest social robot, Zeno, could 
be talking circles around Nexi by the end of this year. At $2500, 
the 23-inch-tall humanoid robot would be a bargain, not 
because of its hardware but because of the code crammed into 
its cartoonish head. ‚ÄúThe intelligent software can be aware of 
multiple people in a room,‚Äù Hanson says. ‚ÄúIt builds a mental 
model of who you are, what you like and what you said. We‚Äôre 
getting to the point where it can hold an open-ended, open-
domain conversation.‚Äù Hanson plans to roll out a $250 mass-
market version in 2011 or 2012, with the same facial- and vocal-
recognition capabilities. His goal is to provide a powerful 
testbed for researchers, while also harnessing AI algorithms to 
make a robot toy that‚Äôs actually fun for more than 15 minutes.
But for all of Nexi‚Äôs and Zeno‚Äôs social skills and painstaking 
simulation of emotional life, the bots are creatures of instinct, 
not introspection. Tracking software Ô¨Ånds the human who‚Äôs 
speaking, a keyword triggers a scripted response, and when 
you leave the room, they don‚Äôt imagine where you‚Äôve gone, 
whether the conversation helped or hurt you, or how to over-
throw your government. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difÔ¨Åcult for an artiÔ¨Åcial intel-
ligence to project in a physical sense,‚Äù says Kevin Warwick, a 
professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading in Eng-
land. ‚ÄúA robot can think about eventualities, but it can‚Äôt think 
even one step ahead about the consequences of its decisions.‚Äù 
There are, of course, researchers who foresee rapid progress 
in computational neuroscience leading to inevitable ‚Äústrong 
AI,‚Äù or artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence that‚Äôs not simply Ô¨Ånishing your 
sentence in a Google search box, but mimicking 
human thought. IBM‚Äôs Blue Brain Project, for 
one, is energizing doomsayers with its goal of 
creating a virtual brain, potentially as soon 
as 2019. Still, without a neurological 
map of our own sense of consequence 
or morality, the breakthroughs that 
would allow for a truly power-hungry 
or evil robot are nowhere in sight. 
Contemplating them is a little like 
debating the ethical pitfalls of 
unregulated teleportation. Until 
someone builds the Enterprise, why 
worry if Scotty is going to drunk-dial 
himself into your house?
Robots will not rise up en masse 
anytime soon. Nexi won‚Äôt be e-mailing 
Zeno the ‚Äúexterminate all humans‚Äù Ô¨Çier 
from R.U.R. to distribute among the world‚Äôs 
Roombas, Predators and assembly-line weld-
ing machines. It‚Äôs a fantasy, or, at best, a 
debate for another century. And like many robot 
fears, it threatens to drown out a more rational debate, one that 
stems from the fact that robots fall through nearly every legal 
and ethical crack. ‚ÄúIf an autistic patient charges a robot and 
tries to damage it, how should the robot respond?‚Äù asks Lin, 
who is also planning to develop ethical guidelines for social 
healthcare bots. ‚ÄúShould it shut down? It‚Äôs an expensive piece 
of equipment‚Äîshould it push back?‚Äù When the robots arrive 
in force, are we prepared for the collateral damage, both physi-
cal and psychological, they could inÔ¨Çict?
When our eyes see a robot, one that we think is autonomous‚Äî
moving, acting, functioning under its own power‚Äîour mirror 
neurons fire. These same neurons activate when we watch 
another animal move, and neuroscientists suspect they‚Äôre 
associated with learning, by way of imitation. Mirror neurons 
could care less about a wax statue, or a remote-control drone. 
It‚Äôs the autonomous robot that lights the fuse, tricking the 
mind into treating a mechanical device as a living thing. 
And yet, like many aspects of human‚Äìrobot interaction, the 
full repercussions are unknown. Science-Ô¨Åction writers may 
have spent a half- century theorizing about the long-term effects 
of living with robots, but science is only getting started. While 
the Ô¨Åeld of HRI goes about the business of collecting data and 
sorting out its methodologies, drawing solid conclusions can 
be impossible, or at least irresponsible. Take those mirror neu-
rons, for example. Neuroscientists can watch them Ô¨Çip on, but 
the exact purpose of those neurons is still up for debate.
Another, more common example of the brain‚Äôs mysterious 
response to robots is often referred to as the uncanny valley‚Äîa 
poetic way of saying, ‚Äúrobots are creepy.‚Äù Proposed in a 1970 
paper by roboticist Masahiro Mori, the uncanny valley 
describes a graph showing that humans feel more familiar 
with, and possibly more comfortable toward, humanoid 
machines. Until, that is, the machine becomes too human-like, 
tripping the same psychological alarms associated with seeing 
a dead or unhealthy human. At that point the graph collapses, 
and then rises again with the response to a real human 
being, or, theoretically, a perfect android. 
Whether this is a distortion of our fight- 
or-flight instincts or something more 
complex, Mori‚Äôs word choice was 
important‚Äîthe uncanny is not naked 
fear, but a mix of familiarity and fear, 
attraction and repulsion. It‚Äôs a 
moment of cognitive dissonance 
that the brain can‚Äôt reconcile, like 
encountering a talking Christmas 
tree, or a laughing corpse.
By academic standards, it‚Äôs 
evocative, exciting stuff, describing 
what appears to be a widespread phe-
nomenon. Nexi‚Äôs unnerving YouTube 
clips seem like textbook examples,  
and the robot has plenty of unsettling 
company. The Japanese social bot CB2 
(Child-robot with Biomimetic Body), with its 
realistic eyes, child-like proportions and gray 
skin, evokes near-universal horror among 
Z e n o
Zeno is more of a business plan than a 
stand-alone humanoid, an attempt by 
Hanson Robotics to channel the company's 
breakthroughs in artiÔ¨Åcial skin and social-
learning algorithms into a hybrid robot toy 
and dirt-cheap research testbed. If Zeno 
catches on with kids, it could be the world‚Äôs 
biggest‚Äîand least controlled‚Äîexperiment 
in human‚Äìrobot interaction.

It‚Äôs not the hardware that makes the evil robot one of Western 
culture‚Äôs most powerful myths. It‚Äôs the software, the artiÔ¨Åcial 
intelligence (AI) that turns machines into monsters. Here are the 
most iconic examples of malevolent AI with the fears each inspired.
Fear of a Bot 
Planet
Golem of Prague
Taught us to fear: unÔ¨Üable 
artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence
In folk tales, the Golem of Prague 
was sculpted from river mud and 
animated with magic, but its 
design is robotic to the core‚Äîbig, 
impossibly Ô¨Ürong and emotion-
less. Its AI is also familiar in its 
limitations: De Golem Ô¨Çoods a 
house when no one tells it to Ô¨Üop 
fetching water. In later versions 
of the myth, it loses its mind. 
The Machines
Taught us to fear: a less deadly 
but more secret insurreFion
In his short Ô¨Üory ‚ÄúDe Evitable 
ConÔ¨ÇiF,‚Äù science-Ô¨ÅFion writer 
Isaac Asimov granted the 
machines control of the world 
economy. Dey proved over-
zealous. Hollywood eventually 
supplied the melodrama, turning 
AI‚Äôs quiet Ô¨Ånancial coup into the 
mass house-arreÔ¨Ü of mankind in 
the movie I, Robot.
Frankenstein‚Äôs Monster 
Taught us to fear: artiÔ¨Åcial genius
A doomed, romantic sociopath, 
the monÔ¨Üer in FrankenÔ¨Üein had a 
whip-smart mind that was his own 
undoing. He learns to speak and 
read in months and to resent his 
creator juÔ¨Ü as quickly. Critics call 
this the world‚Äôs moÔ¨Ü inÔ¨Çuential 
evil-robot Ô¨Üory. FrankenÔ¨Üein 
refuses to build a mate, fearing a 
superior, malevolent race that 
would deÔ¨Üroy mankind. 
Radius
Taught us to fear: organized 
robotic insurreFion
Like FrankenÔ¨Üein‚Äôs monÔ¨Üer, the 
robots in the play R.U.R. are 
Ô¨Çesh-and-blood murderers. De 
diÔ¨Äerence is scale: Dese robots 
are mass-produced from 
faFory-grown organs, and they 
succeed in wiping out the human 
race. De robot leader, Radius, 
doesn‚Äôt mince words, saying, ‚ÄúI 
wish to be the maÔ¨Üer of people.‚Äù
HAL 9000
Taught us to fear: AI-controlled 
syÔ¨Üems
De singsong condescension in 
HAL 9000‚Äôs voice should have 
been a warning sign. But by the 
time 2001: A Space Odyssey 
leaps from sci-Ô¨Å to horror, it‚Äôs too 
late‚Äîthe AI jettisons the human 
crew members it considers to be 
a liability to the spacecraW‚Äôs 
mission. Like Asimov‚Äôs machines, 
HAL isn‚Äôt malicious, juÔ¨Ü a little 
too smart for our own good.
The Machines
Taught us to fear: everything in 
>e Terminator, and robot slavers
De machines of >e Matrix are a 
deliriously twiÔ¨Üed race of AIs. 
Dey turn prisoners into battery 
packs, craW vaÔ¨Ü virtual worlds to 
keep us occupied and, as 
evidenced by Agent Smith, are 
capable of abjeF hatred. De real 
horror of >e Matrix (sequels 
aside) is the prospeF of machines 
not only conquering mankind, but 
toying with our defeated species.
T-800/Skynet
Taught us to fear: networked, 
self-organizing AI
Skynet never appears on camera 
in >e Terminator, but the movie‚Äôs 
eponymous enforcer bears its 
message: De planet‚Äôs not big 
enough for biological and artiÔ¨Åcial 
intelligence. We also don‚Äôt see 
the advanced defense computer 
becoming self-aware. InÔ¨Üead, the 
movie shows the smoldering 
aWermath of war, giving an old 
myth its moÔ¨Ü powerful update.
ED-209
Taught us to fear: armed, 
autonomous robots
In RoboCop, ED-209 has the 
cognitive powers of a very smart 
police dog and the Ô¨Årepower of 
an attack chopper. And, like dogs 
trained for violence, ED-209 
sometimes bites the wrong 
person: In one of the movie‚Äôs 
moÔ¨Ü memorable scenes, the 
security bot botches its own 
sales demo by gunning down an 
unarmed civilian.

bloggers and reporters. Another Japanese robot, KOBIAN, fea-
tures a wildly expressive face, with prominent eyebrows and a 
set of fully formed, ruby-red lips. It, too, was instantly branded 
creepy by the Western press. The designers of those social bots 
were actually trying to avoid the uncanny‚ÄîAsian labs are 
packed with photorealistic androids that leap headlong into the 
twitching, undead depths of Mori‚Äôs valley.
But just as the Terminator scenario withers under scrutiny, 
the uncanny valley theory is nowhere near as tidy as it sounds. 
Based on those YouTube clips, I had expected my meeting with 
Nexi to be hair-curling. Instead, I can see my grin scattered 
across computer monitors in the Media Lab. Nexi‚Äôs forehead- 
mounted, depth-sensing infrared camera shows my face as a 
black and gray blur, and the camera in its right eye portrays me 
in color. I watch as I slip from the monitors, Nexi‚Äôs head and 
eyes smoothly tracking to the next face. I am not creeped out‚Äî
I‚Äôm a little jealous. I want Nexi to look at me again.
‚ÄúThere are some very practical things that we do to make 
our robots not creepy,‚Äù Berlin says. The secret to Nexi‚Äôs suc-
cess, apparently, is within arm‚Äôs reach of the robot: a slightly 
battered hardcover book titled The Illusion of Life: Disney  
Animation‚Äîrequired reading for the Personal Robots Group. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making an animation, in real time,‚Äù Berlin says. Like 
many animated characters, Nexi‚Äôs features and movements are 
those of exaggerated humanity. When it reaches for an object, 
its arm doesn‚Äôt shoot forward with eerie precision. It wastes 
time and resources, orienting its eyes, head and body, and 
lazily arcing its hand toward the target. Nexi is physically inef-
Ô¨Åcient, but socially proÔ¨Åcient.
How proÔ¨Åcient? In interactions with hundreds of human 
subjects, including residents of three Boston-area senior cen-
ters, researchers claim that no one has run screaming from 
Nexi. Quite the opposite: Many seniors tried to shake the robot‚Äôs 
hand, or hug it. At least one of them planted a kiss on it. ‚ÄúIt 
interacts with people in this very social way, so people treat it as 
a social entity in an interpersonal way, rather than a machine-
like way,‚Äù Cynthia Breazeal, director of the Personal 
Robots Group, says. ‚ÄúIn studies with Nexi, we‚Äôve 
shown that if you have the robot behave and 
move in ways that are known to enhance 
trust and engagement, the reaction is 
the same as it is with people. You‚Äôre 
pushing the same buttons.‚Äù
That principle has proven true 
for CB2 and KOBIAN as well. The 
research leaders of both projects 
claim that the apprehension 
directed at their robots online and 
in the media never materializes in 
person. With the exception of one 
Thai princess, everyone who encoun-
tered CB2 liked it, according to Osaka 
University‚Äôs Minoru Asada. A Japanese 
newspaper brought a group of elderly to 
visit KOBIAN. They were ‚Äúdeeply pleased 
and moved,‚Äù Atsuo Takanishi, a professor of 
mechanical engineering at Waseda Univer-
sity, says, ‚Äúas if the robot really had emotion.‚Äù
Even if the uncanny valley ends up being more of a shallow 
trench, one that‚Äôs easily leveled by actually meeting an android, 
the success of Nexi and company only raises a more profound 
question: Why do we fall so hard for robots?
‚ÄúIt turns out that we‚Äôre vulnerable to attaching, emotionally, 
to objects. We are extremely cheap dates,‚Äù says Sherry Turkle, 
director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. ‚ÄúDo we 
really want to exploit that?‚Äù Turkle has studied the powerful 
bond that can form between humans and robots such as Paro, 
an almost painfully cute Japanese baby-seal-shaped therapy 
bot that squirms in your arms, coos when caressed and 
recharges by sucking on a cabled paciÔ¨Åer. She has also docu-
mented assumptions of intelligence and even emotion reported 
by children playing with robotic dolls. The effect that Paro, a 
therapy bot that‚Äôs little more than an animatronic stuffed ani-
mal, had on senior citizens only reinforced her concerns. ‚ÄúTell 
me again why I need a robot baby sitter?‚Äù Turkle asks. ‚ÄúWhat 
are we saying to the child? What are we saying to the older per-
son? That we‚Äôre too busy with e-mail to care for those in need?‚Äù 
To researchers like Turkle, the widespread deployment of 
social robots is as risky as it is inevitable. With some analysts 
estimating a $15 billion market for personal robots by 2015, the 
demand for expressive machines is expected to be voracious. At 
the heart of Turkle‚Äôs argument‚Äîa call for caution, essentially‚Äî
is the fear of outsourcing human interaction to autonomous 
machines. Even more alarming are the potential beneÔ¨Åciaries of 
robotic companionship, from children in understaffed schools 
to seniors suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs. Enlisting an army of 
robots to monitor the young and the elderly could be a bargain 
compared to the cost of hiring thousands of teachers and live-in 
nurses. But how will the Ô¨Årst generation to grow up with robotic 
authority Ô¨Ågures and friends handle unpredictable human rela-
tionships? Without more data, a well-intended response to man-
power shortage could take on the ethical and legal dimensions 
of distributing a new and untested antidepressant.
One possible solution is to scale back the autonomy and 
use social bots as puppets. Huggable, another robot 
from MIT‚Äôs Personal Robots Group, is a teddy 
bear whose movements can be controlled 
through a Web browser. The researchers 
plan to use it to comfort hospitalized 
children; family members or doctors 
would operate it remotely. When  
I see Huggable, it‚Äôs actually a teddy 
bear skeleton. The furry coat, 
which will eventually be replaced 
with one that includes pressure- 
and touch-sensitive sensors, sits in 
a heap next to the bot as it Ô¨Ådgets. 
An open laptop shows the opera-
tor‚Äôs view through Huggable‚Äôs cam-
era and a menu of simple commands, 
such as raising and lowering its arms, 
or aiming its head at my face. 
For now, Huggable has no identity of its 
own. It‚Äôs a high-tech ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy 
channeling the voice of its operator, not a  
full-Ô¨Çedged social creature. In a recent paper 
K o b i a n
This Japanese invention is the intellec-
tual love child of a pair of earlier Waseda 
University robots‚Äîone was an expressive 
head, the other a humanoid body. The 
result is what its creators call ‚Äúan emotional 
humanoid,‚Äù able to express emotions with 
its entire body, potentially allowing personal 
robots to better communicate with humans.

describing the dangers of ‚Äúparent‚Äù modes in Jap-
anese robotic toys and the temptation to use 
robots as nannies, Noel Sharkey, a professor of 
artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence and robotics at the Univer-
sity of Sheffield in England, cited Huggable‚Äôs 
lack of autonomy as a selling point. ‚ÄúSuch robots 
do not give rise to the same ethical concerns  
as exclusive or near-exclusive care by autono-
mous robots,‚Äù he wrote with a co-author. Semi-
autonomy might not cut payrolls, but it could be 
a safer way to roll out the Ô¨Årst wave of social bots.
Sharkey‚Äôs and Turkle‚Äôs ominous point of view 
overlaps uncomfortably with the climate of fear 
that has always surrounded robots. And yet, 
nearly every researcher I spoke with agreed on a 
single point: We need ethical guidelines for 
robots, and we need them now. Not because 
robots lack a moral compass, but because their 
creators are operating in an ethical and legal  
vacuum. ‚ÄúWhen a bridge falls down, we have a 
rough-and-ready set of guidelines for apportion-
ing out accountability,‚Äù says P.W. Singer, a senior 
fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of 
Wired for War. ‚ÄúNow we have the equivalent of a 
bridge that can get up and move and operate in 
the world, and we don‚Äôt have a way of Ô¨Åguring out 
who‚Äôs responsible for it when it falls down.‚Äù
In a debate steeped in speculation and short 
on empirical data, a set of smart ethical guide-
lines could act as an insurance policy. ‚ÄúMy con-
cern is not about the immediate yuck factor: 
What if this robot goes wrong?‚Äù says Chris Elliott, 
a systems engineer and trial lawyer who contributed to a recent 
Royal Academy report on autonomous systems. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that peo-
ple will go wrong.‚Äù Even if the large-scale psychological impact 
of social robots turns out to be zero, Elliott worries that a single 
mishap, and the corresponding backlash, could reverse years 
of progress. Imagine the media coverage of the Ô¨Årst patient 
killed by a robotic surgeon, an autonomous car that T-bones a 
school bus or a video clip of a robotic orderly wrestling with a 
dementia patient. ‚ÄúThe law is way behind. We could reach a 
point where we‚Äôre afraid to deploy new beneficial robots 
because of the legal uncertainty,‚Äù Elliott says.
The exact nature of those guidelines is still anyone‚Äôs guess. 
One option would be to restrict the use of each robotic class or 
model to a specific mission‚Äînurse bots that can visit with 
patients within a certain age range, or elder-care bots that watch 
for dangerous falls but aren‚Äôt built for small talk and snuggling. 
In the long run, David Hanson believes AI should be explicitly 
programmed to cooperate with humans, so that when robots 
self-evolve they have what he calls the ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù not to harm us. 
Cynthia Breazeal‚Äôs take is more hard-nosed. ‚ÄúNow is certainly 
the time to start hammering things out,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPeople 
should have a serious dialogue before these robots are in con-
tact with vulnerable populations.‚Äù
Philosophers, ethicists, lawyers and roboticists have only 
begun the hard work of Ô¨Çeshing out Asimov‚Äôs early code of 
robo-ethics. In the meantime, if there‚Äôs a way to dismantle our 
long- standing, irrational fear of robots and head off any risk of 
a Luddite backlash, it might be up to robots such as Nexi. 
While I‚Äôm eyeing the gears and servos along Nexi‚Äôs exposed 
back, a tour group shows up in the Media Lab unannounced. A 
crowd of kids, maybe Ô¨Åfth or sixth graders, approaches the 
robot. Nexi is tracking their faces when one of the boys gets a 
little too close. The robot‚Äôs eyebrows swivel inward. The eyelids 
narrow as the head tilts down. And the worm motors that con-
trol Nexi‚Äôs Ô¨Ångers whine like electric drills as its Ô¨Åsts clench.
‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù the kid in the lead says, and they all backpedal.
‚ÄúIs it getting mad?‚Äù one girl asks the researchers.
Then Nexi‚Äôs face softens and, instantly, they‚Äôre laughing.
‚ÄúSo do you give robots emotions?‚Äù another girl asks.
I remember something Breazeal told me earlier: that for kids 
who grow up around robots, the uncanny valley could be irrele-
vant and The Terminator little more than a quaint story. Vulner-
able or not, children interact with these machines differently. 
Understanding the limits and strange potential of robotics 
might be as simple as letting them meet the models most like 
them‚Äîthe ones built to live at their sides. Maybe Nexi could act 
as that Ô¨Årst, limited exposure, a vaccine against the wild fears 
and warped perceptions the rest of us have grown up with.
The kids provoke Nexi‚Äôs anger response again, laughing 
more this time. When its eyebrows level, the lead boy jabs his 
friend and points at the robot‚Äôs impassive face.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs smiling at you! It‚Äôs smiling!‚Äù 
FC
Cynthia Breazeal, the dire0or of MIT‚Äôs Personal Robots 
Group, says social robots require syÔ¨Üems that are 
‚Äúsavvy and intelligent in their intera0ions with people,‚Äù 
not simply compatible with obje0s.

SINCE ITS COMPLETION IN 1914, the Panama Canal has been the crossroads of the Western Hemi-
sphere. But the growing dominance of megaships threatened to turn the 50-mile-long passage between 
the PaciÔ¨Åc and the Atlantic into a regional backwater. Hence the current $5.25 billion expansion pro-
gram designed to keep the canal relevant in future maritime trade. The existing three sets of locks  
handle vessels up to 965 feet long and 106 feet wide (so-called Panamax ships). When the seven-year 
modernization plan is completed during the canal‚Äôs centennial, those facilities will be complemented 
by a  slightly longer third lane of trafÔ¨Åc with two new sets of locks and approach channels that can accom-
modate post-Panamax ships up to 1200 feet long and 160 feet wide.
Here‚Äôs how the upgrade will work. A post-Panamax freighter from Asia bound for, say, Norfolk, Va., 
will nose into the canal west of the existing PaciÔ¨Åc entrance and head up a new mile-long channel to 
At Cerro Goyo, northweÔ¨Ü of the Pedro Miguel Locks on the Panama 
Canal, a 1400-hp hydraulic shovel claws 22 cubic yards per swipe. Part 
of a $5.25 billion expansion, this excavation will conneU a new set of 
locks to the exiÔ¨Üing waterway.

a sea-level canal‚Äî

waterway‚Äîacross 
the iÔ¨Ühmus. Some 
20,000 workers died 
in the failed eÔ¨Äort. In 
1904 the U.S. paid 
France $40 million 
for its equipment 
and excavations and, 
in 1914, completed 
a canal with dams 
and locks. In 1999, 
the U.S. transferred 
control of the canal 
to Panama.

knife through the Continental Divide at the Culebra Cut. Five miles on, the supersize ship will enter man-
made Gatun Lake, which it will cross in a 45-mile-long expanded navigation channel to reach a new three-
step lock complex and water lane east of the existing Gatun Locks and channel. (Crews will use all of the 
World War II‚Äìera excavation here.) Two miles later‚Äîand, depending on trafÔ¨Åc, 8 to 10 hours after entering

YOU HAVE A LATE NIGHT AND AN EARLY FLIGHT. NOT 
long after takeoff, you drift to sleep. Suddenly, you‚Äôre 
wide awake. There‚Äôs cold air rushing everywhere, and 
sound. Intense, horrible sound. Where am I?, you think. 
Where‚Äôs the plane?
You‚Äôre 6 miles up. You‚Äôre alone. You‚Äôre falling.
Things are bad. But now‚Äôs the time to focus on the 
good news. (Yes, it goes beyond surviving the destruc-
tion of your aircraft.) Although gravity is against you, 
another force is working in your favor: time. Believe it or 
not, you‚Äôre better off up here than if you‚Äôd slipped from 
the balcony of your high-rise hotel room after one too 
many drinks last night.
Or at least you will be. Oxygen is scarce at these 
heights. By now, hypoxia is starting to set in. You‚Äôll be 
unconscious soon, and you‚Äôll cannonball at least a mile 
before waking up again. When that happens, remember 
what you are about to read. The ground, after all, is your 
next destination.
Granted, the odds of surviving a 6-mile plummet are 
extra ordinarily slim, but at this point you‚Äôve got nothing 
g

to lose by understanding your situation. 
There are two ways to fall out of a plane. 
The Ô¨Årst is to free-fall, or drop from the 
sky with absolutely no protection or 
means of slowing your descent. The sec-
ond is to become a wreckage rider, a 
term coined by Massachusetts-based 
amateur historian Jim Hamilton, who developed the Free Fall 
Research Page‚Äîan online database of nearly every imaginable 
human plummet. That classification means you have the 
advantage of being attached to a chunk of the plane. In 1972, 
Serbian Ô¨Çight attendant Vesna Vulovic was traveling in a DC-9 
over Czechoslovakia when it blew up. She fell 33,000 feet, 
wedged between her seat, a catering trolley, a section of aircraft 
and the body of another crew member, landing on‚Äîthen slid-
ing down‚Äîa snowy incline before coming to a stop, severely 
injured but alive. 
Surviving a plunge surrounded by a semiprotective cocoon 
of debris is more common than surviving a pure free-fall, 
according to Hamilton‚Äôs statistics; 31 such conÔ¨Årmed or ‚Äúplau-
sible‚Äù incidents have occurred since the 1940s. Free-fallers con-
stitute a much more exclusive club, with just 13 conÔ¨Årmed or 
plausible incidents, including perennial Ripley‚Äôs Believe It or 
Not superstar Alan Magee‚Äîblown from his B-17 on a 1943 mis-
sion over France. The New Jersey airman, more recently the sub-
ject of a MythBusters episode, fell 20,000 feet and crashed into a 
train station; he was subsequently captured by German troops, 
who were astonished at his survival.
Whether you‚Äôre attached to crumpled fuselage or just plain 
falling, the concept you‚Äôll be most interested in is terminal 
velocity. As gravity pulls you toward earth, you go faster. But like 
any moving object, you create drag‚Äîmore as your speed 
increases. When downward force equals upward resistance, 
acceleration stops. You max out. 
Depending on your size and weight, and factors such as air 
density, your speed at that moment will be about 120 mph‚Äî
and you‚Äôll get there after a surprisingly brief bit of falling: just 
1500 feet, about the same height as Chicago‚Äôs Sears (now Wil-
lis) Tower. Equal speed means you hit the ground with equal 
force. The difference is the clock. Body meets Windy City side-
walk in 12 seconds. From an airplane‚Äôs cruising altitude, you‚Äôll 
have almost enough time to read this entire article.
7:00:20 AM
vv8qD??s
BY NOW, YOU‚ÄôVE DESCENDED INTO BREATHABLE AIR. YOU
sputter into consciousness. At this altitude, you‚Äôve got roughly 
2 minutes until impact. Your plan is simple. You will enter a 
Zen state and decide to live. You will understand, as Hamilton 
notes, ‚Äúthat it isn‚Äôt the fall that kills you‚Äîit‚Äôs the landing.‚Äù
Keeping your wits about you, you take aim. 
But at what? Magee‚Äôs landing on the stone floor of that 
French train station was softened by the skylight he crashed 
through a moment earlier. Glass hurts, but it gives. So does 
grass. Haystacks and bushes have 
cushioned surprised-to-be-alive 
free-fallers. Trees aren‚Äôt bad, 
though they tend to skewer. Snow? 
Absolutely. Swamps? With their 
mucky, plant-covered surface, even 
more awesome. Hamilton docu-
ments one case of a sky diver who, 
upon total parachute failure, was 
saved by bouncing off high-tension 
wires. Contrary to popular belief, 
water is an awful choice. Like con-
crete, liquid doesn‚Äôt compress. Hit-
ting the ocean is essentially the 
same as colliding with a sidewalk, 
Hamilton explains, except that 
pavement (perhaps unfortunately) 
won‚Äôt ‚Äúopen up and swallow your shattered body.‚Äù
With a target in mind, the next consideration is body posi-
tion. To slow your descent, emulate a sky diver. Spread your 
arms and legs, present your chest to the ground, and arch your 
back and head upward. This adds friction and helps you 
maneuver. But don‚Äôt relax. This is not your landing pose. 
The question of how to achieve ground contact remains, 
regrettably, given your predicament, a subject of debate. A 1942 
study in the journal War Medicine noted ‚Äúdistribution and com-
pensation of pressure play large parts in the defeat of injury.‚Äù 
Recommendation: wide-body impact. But a 1963 report by the 
Federal Aviation Agency argued that shifting into the classic 
sky diver‚Äôs landing stance‚Äîfeet together, heels up, flexed 
knees and hips‚Äîbest increases survivability. The same study 
noted that training in wrestling and acrobatics would help peo-
ple survive falls. Martial arts were deemed especially useful for 
hard-surface impacts: ‚ÄúA ‚Äòblack belt‚Äô expert can reportedly 
crack solid wood with a single blow,‚Äù the authors wrote, specu-
lating that such skills might be transferable. 
The ultimate learn-by-doing experience might be a lesson 
from Japanese parachutist Yasuhiro Kubo, who holds the world 
record in the activity‚Äôs banzai category. The sky diver tosses his 
chute from the plane and then jumps out after it, waiting as 
long as possible to retrieve it, put it on and pull the ripcord. In 
2000, Kubo‚Äîstarting from 9842 feet‚Äîfell for 50 seconds 
before recovering his gear. A safer way to practice your tech-
nique would be at one of the wind-tunnel simulators found at 
about a dozen U.S. theme parks and malls. But neither will help 
with the toughest part: sticking the landing. For that you might 
consider‚Äîthough it‚Äôs not exactly advisable‚Äîa leap off the 
world‚Äôs highest bridge, France‚Äôs Millau Viaduct; its platform 
towers 891 feet over mostly spongy farmland. 
To slow your descent, emulate a sky 
diver. Spread your arms and legs, 
present your chest to the ground, 
and arch 
your back 
and head 
upward ... 
But don't 
relax. 
This is 
not your 
landing 
pose. 

Water landings‚Äîif you must‚Äîrequire quick decision-
making. Studies of bridge-jump survivors indicate that a feet-
Ô¨Årst, knife-like entry (aka ‚Äúthe pencil‚Äù) best optimizes your 
odds of resurfacing. The famed cliff divers of Acapulco, how-
ever, tend to assume a head-down position, with the Ô¨Ångers of 
each hand locked together, arms outstretched, protecting the 
head. Whichever you choose, Ô¨Årst assume the free-fall position 
for as long as you can. Then, if a feet-Ô¨Årst entry is inevitable, the 
most important piece of advice, for reasons both unmention-
able and easily understood, is to clench your butt. 
No matter the surface, deÔ¨Ånitely don‚Äôt land on your head. In 
a 1977 ‚ÄúStudy of Impact Tolerance Through Free-Fall Investiga-
tions,‚Äù researchers at the Highway Safety Research Institute 
found that the major cause of death in falls‚Äîthey examined 
drops from buildings, bridges and the occasional elevator shaft 
(oops!)‚Äîwas cranial contact. If you have to arrive top-down, sac-
riÔ¨Åce your good looks and land on your face, rather than the 
back or top of your head. You might also consider Ô¨Çying with a 
pair of goggles in your pocket, Hamilton says, since you‚Äôre likely 
to get watery eyes‚Äîimpairing accuracy‚Äîon the way down.

GIVEN YOUR STARTING ALTITUDE, YOU‚ÄôLL BE JUST ABOUT
ready to hit the ground as you reach this section of instruction 
(based on the average adult reading speed of 250 words per 
minute). The basics have been covered, so feel free to concen-
trate on the task at hand. But if you‚Äôre so inclined, here‚Äôs some 
supplemental information‚Äîthough be warned that none of it 
will help you much at this point.
Statistically speaking, it‚Äôs best to be a Ô¨Çight crew member, a 
child, or traveling in a military aircraft. Over the past four 
decades, there have been at least a dozen commercial airline 
crashes with just one survivor. Of those documented, four of 
the survivors were crew, like the Ô¨Çight attendant Vulovic, and 
seven were passengers under the age of 18. That includes 
Mohammed el-Fateh Osman, a 2-year-old wreckage rider who 
lived through the crash of a Boeing jet in Sudan in 2003, and, 
more recently, 14-year-old Bahia Bakari, the sole survivor of last 
June‚Äôs Yemenia Airways plunge off the Comoros Islands. 
Crew survival may be related to better restraint systems, but 
there‚Äôs no consensus on why children seem to pull through falls 
more often. The Federal Aviation Agency study notes that kids, 
especially those under the age of 4, have more Ô¨Çexible skeletons, 
more relaxed muscle tonus, and a higher proportion of subcuta-
neous fat, which helps protect internal organs. Smaller people‚Äî
whose heads are lower than the seat backs in front of them‚Äîare 
better shielded from debris in a plane that‚Äôs coming apart. 
Lower body weight reduces terminal velocity, plus reduced sur-
face area decreases the chance of impalement upon landing.

THE GROUND. LIKE A SHAOLIN MASTER, YOU ARE AT PEACE
and prepared. Impact. You‚Äôre alive. What next? If you‚Äôre lucky, 
you might Ô¨Ånd that your injuries are minor, stand up and smoke 
a celebratory cigarette, as British tail gunner Nicholas Alkemade 
did in 1944 after landing in snowy bushes following an 18,000-
foot plummet. (If you‚Äôre a smoker, you‚Äôre super extra lucky, since 
you‚Äôve technically gotten to indulge during the course of an air-
liner trip.) More likely, you‚Äôll have tough work ahead. 
Follow the example of Juliane Koepcke. On Christmas Eve 
1971, the Lockheed Electra she was traveling in exploded over 
the Amazon. The next morning, the 17-year-old German awoke 
on the jungle Ô¨Çoor, strapped into her seat, surrounded by fallen 
holiday gifts. Injured and alone, she pushed the death of her 
mother, who‚Äôd been seated next to her on the plane, out of her 
mind. Instead, she remembered advice from her father, a biolo-
gist: To Ô¨Ånd civilization when lost in the jungle, follow water. 
Koepcke waded from tiny streams to larger ones. She passed 
crocodiles and poked the mud in front of her with a stick to 
scare away stingrays. She had lost one shoe in the fall and was 
wearing a ripped miniskirt. Her only food was a bag of candy, 
and she had nothing but dark, dirty water to drink. She ignored 
her broken collarbone and her wounds, infested with maggots.
On the tenth day, she rested on the bank of the Shebonya 
River. When she stood up again, she saw a canoe tethered to 
the shoreline. It took her hours to climb the embankment to a 
hut, where, the next day, a group of lumberjacks found her. The 
incident was seen as a miracle in Peru, and free-fall statistics 
seem to support those arguing for divine intervention: Accord-
ing to the Geneva-based Aircraft Crashes Record OfÔ¨Åce, 118,934 
people have died in 15,463 plane crashes between 1940 and 
2008. Even when you add failed-chute sky divers, Hamilton‚Äôs 
tally of conÔ¨Årmed or plausible lived-to-tell-about-it incidents is 
only 157, with 42 occurring at heights over 10,000 feet. 
But Koepcke never saw survival as a matter of fate. She can 
still recall the Ô¨Årst moments of her fall from the plane, as she 
spun through the air in her seat. That wasn‚Äôt under her control, 
but what happened when she regained consciousness was. ‚ÄúI 
had been able to make the correct decision‚Äîto leave the scene 
of the crash,‚Äù she says now. And because of experience at her 
parents‚Äô biological research station, she says, ‚ÄúI did not feel fear. 
I knew how to move in the forest and the river, in which I had to 
swim with dangerous animals like caimans and piranhas.‚Äù 
Or, by now, you‚Äôre wide awake, and the aircraft‚Äôs wheels 
have touched safely down on the tarmac. You understand the 
odds of any kind of accident on a commercial Ô¨Çight are slim-
mer than slim and that you will likely never have to use this 
information. But as a courtesy to the next passenger, consider 
leaving your copy of this guide in the seat-back pocket.

he abracadabra moment comes late on a winter after-
noon, when Jay Thompson pulls a lever on the Jahns 
Structure Jacking System. As pressurized hydraulic Ô¨Çuid 
surges to carefully positioned jacks, the shingled cottage on 
New Jersey‚Äôs Long Beach Island parts ways with the brick foun-
dation that has held it earthbound for the past 120 years. A 
barely perceptible gap grows until daylight is plainly visible 
under the house.
Thompson, of Atlantic Structure Movers, has performed 
this levitational act thousands of times. There‚Äôs no magic to 
moving a house, he claims, just lots of gritty labor. But while 
watching 25 tons of historically signiÔ¨Åcant lumber hovering 
several feet in the air, it‚Äôs tempting to credit him with some 
degree of wizardry. ‚ÄúEverything we do is based on moving prin-
ciples used since the ancient Egyptians,‚Äù Thompson says. Even 
the most gigantic load can be skidded a short distance, rolled 
over a long one or levered the last fraction of an inch until its 
position is perfect. Lighthouses and airport terminals have 
been transported that way. Those big, bold moves grab the 
spotlight, but a small relocation like this cottage is standard 
fare for structure movers, who suddenly Ô¨Ånd themselves bask-
ing in a green glow. After all, what‚Äôs more environmentally 
friendly than reusing a house rather than scrapping it?
While it‚Äôs physically possible to move almost anything, it 
isn‚Äôt always economically feasible. The cost of disconnecting 
power lines, moving trafÔ¨Åc signals and streetlights and trim-
ming overhanging tree limbs mounts quickly. In the congested 
eastern U.S., a move of more than a few blocks is often impracti-
cal. In the less populated Midwest and West, a move of 40 miles 
HOUSE MOVING REQUIRES HARD WORK, BOLDNESS AND A SENSE OF TIMING. IT DOESN‚ÄôT 
HURT TO HAVE A BIG TRUCK AND A MASSIVE HYDRAULIC RIG AS WELL.


can make sense. It costs $12 to $16 per square foot to move a 
house. Of course, that price doesn‚Äôt include a new building lot, 
a new foundation or building-code-related improvements.
But there are times when history trumps economics. Known 
locally as the Fisherman‚Äôs Cottage, the little wood-frame struc-
ture was completed in 1880 and is among the last of the island‚Äôs 
simple, original dwellings. It stands in sharp contrast to the 
rambling Victorians that wealthy summer residents were 
already then building. The house‚Äôs owner sold it to the local his-
torical society for $1, and it will get a new lease on life as a small 
museum. The task for Thompson is straightforward: Transport 
the cottage a block and a half to a prepared site.
The real action occurs once the house has been cut loose 
from water, sewage, electricity and other utilities. Thompson 
and his crew punch holes through the foundation, slide steel 
beams under and alongside the house and use hydraulic jacks 
to lift the structure on this steel frame. ‚ÄúOur methods are easy 
on the house,‚Äù Thompson says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve moved homes with all 
the furniture inside and pictures hanging on the walls.‚Äù
Since the jacks are not tall enough to raise the house in one 
pass, it‚Äôs jacked up and supported on cribbing, then the jacks 
are positioned on the cribbing and the house is raised again. 
 ompson‚Äôs crew faÔ¨Üens the H-beams  
under and along the house with induÔ¨Ürial-
duty, drop-forged C-clamps.  e movers 
tighten the clamps with a wrench, which 
makes the hardened point of the clamp‚Äôs 
screw bear down with thousands of pounds 
of force. Once the Ô¨Üeel is positioned and 
Ô¨Årmly clamped, the house is ready to be 
liBed oÔ¨Ä its foundation.

To keep a house safely supported,  ompson 
(below) and his men position and reposition 
tons of cribbing, each a 4-foot-long  
6 x 6. Buildings are unevenly weighted; the 
trailer-mounted hydraulic syÔ¨Üem behind 
 ompson can be adjuÔ¨Üed to compensate 
for those variations and ensure that the 
house Ô¨Üays level as it is liBed.

When the house rests on cribbing piers of adequate height, 
Thompson takes the wheel of a 2¬Ω-ton truck‚Äîa former Army 
‚Äúdeuce and a half.‚Äù He backs its trailer under the house, which 
is then lowered onto the Ô¨Çatbed. Thompson coaxes the struc-
ture forward, unfazed by its tilt even though the only thing 
holding it in place is friction. ‚ÄúIt appears more dramatic to 
onlookers than it does to us,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA small angle at the 
trailer is enough to produce quite a lean on a tall building.‚Äù
Then the trailer crawls down the street to the house‚Äôs new 
location. It‚Äôs not the cottage‚Äôs Ô¨Årst move. In 1890, mules hauled 
it a short distance over logs to where it remained until today.
Movers rub bar 
soap on high-
density plaÔ¨Üic that 
they place on top of 
the cribbing. 9ey 
lower the house 
onto these ‚Äúsoap 
boards‚Äù and slide 
the Ô¨Üru=ure into 
its Ô¨Ånal position. 
Below, the cottage 
awaits its new 
foundation and a 
second life as a 
small museum.

It‚Äôs 21 feet from the Ô¨Üreet to the house‚Äôs 
peak‚Äîhigher than a 13-foot-tall tra=or 
trailer‚Äîso utility crews Ô¨Üay busy moving 
wires. Still, there‚Äôs no rush. ‚ÄúWe move at a 
crawl,‚Äù 9ompson says. ‚ÄúYou take your foot 
oÔ¨Ä the gas and push in the clutch, and the 
truck comes to an almoÔ¨Ü immediate Ô¨Üop.‚Äù 
Otherwise, it‚Äôs man versus machine as 9omp-
son wreÔ¨Üles the truck in and out of tight 
spots. ‚Äú9e truck is equipped with what we 
call arm-Ô¨Ürong Ô¨Üeering,‚Äù he says with a laugh.

At the new lot, 
9ompson posi-
tions the trailer 
above a footing 
built earlier by a 
masonry contrac-
tor. He jacks up the 
cottage and drives 
out from under the 
Ô¨Üru=ure. 
At the new lot, Thompson again positions the house on 
cribbing. Then he resorts to a trick that only a structure mover 
would know. To Ô¨Åne-tune the cottage‚Äôs position, he uses tilted 
jacks that rest on rolls of foam padding. As the jacks take on 
weight, they straighten and shift the house into place. ‚ÄúIf I get 
all four jacks tilted in different directions,‚Äù Thompson says, ‚ÄúI 
can rotate the house.‚Äù 
At last, the cottage is oriented. Once the foundation is com-
pleted inside the cribbing perimeter, Thompson will jack up the 
house again to remove beams and cribbing, then lower it on the 
foundation. There it will remain‚Äîuntil its next move.

UST BEFORE 8 AM ON AUG. 17, 2009, WORKERS ON THE 
morning shift stepped off a clattering Soviet-era tram and made 
their way past security and into position at the Sayano- 
Shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant in south-central Siberia. In 
the 950-foot-long turbine hall, custodians mopped the stone Ô¨Çoors 
and supervisors handed out assignments. On the roof, a technician 
began installing a new ventilation system. Above him soared a con-
cave dam 80 stories high and more than half a mile wide at the crest. 
When operating at full capacity, the plant‚Äôs 10 interior penstocks fun-
neled water from the reservoir behind the concrete barrier to the hall 
below him, where it tore past the blades of 10 turbines, spinning them 
with tremendous force before being Ô¨Çushed out of the hydro plant 
and down the Yenisei River.
Completed in 1978, the Soviet-era hydro station is Russia‚Äôs largest, 
with enough output to power a city of 3.8 million. It was undergoing 
extensive repairs and upgrades that morning, so more workers were in

the hall than usual: 52 on the main Ô¨Çoor and another 63 
down in the bowels of the plant. Nine of the 10 turbines 
were operating at full capacity‚Äîincluding the trouble-
some Turbine 2, which had been ofÔ¨Çine but was pressed 
back into service the previous night when electricity pro-
duction dropped because of a Ô¨Åre at the Bratsk power sta-
tion, 500 miles to the northeast. A few minutes into his 
shift, the technician felt the roof begin to vibrate. The 
vibrations grew louder and gradually turned into a thun-
derous roar. Alarmed, he scrambled off the roof. 
At 8:13 am, two massive explosions rocked the hall. 
Security guard Aleksandr Kataytsev told English-language 
news station RT that he was one level below the turbine hall 
when he heard ‚Äúa loud thump, then another one, like an 
explosion, and then the room went pitch-black.‚Äù 
Turbine 2‚Äîa 1500-ton piece of machinery topped by 
a power generator‚Äîblasted through the Ô¨Çoor and shot  
50 feet into the air before crashing back down. The pen-
stock water that had been spinning the turbine geysered 
out of the now-vacant shaft at a rate of 67,600 gallons  
per second. Like a massive industrial waterjet, it tore 
down the metal joists over Turbines 1, 2 and 3; the roof 
there crumpled like aluminum foil and collapsed in a  
tangle of glass and metal.
Water continued to pour into the hall, flooding its 
lower levels and eventually submerging other turbines. 
The plant‚Äôs automatic safety system should have shut 
down the turbines and closed the intake gates on the pen-
stocks at the top of the dam, but Turbines 7 and 9 still 
operated at full speed, in excess of 142 rpm, triggering the 
crackling short circuits that darkened the plant. Amateur 
video footage taken downstream at the time of the acci-
dent shows bright Ô¨Çashes and a huge explosion in the 
vicinity of Turbines 7 and 9 as a wall of water spews from 
the structural breach near Turbine 2. 
As the water level rose, employees stampeded toward 
the main entrance. Fearing a total collapse of the dam, 
many phoned relatives downstream and urged them to 
seek shelter in the surrounding Sayan Mountains. Among 
the Ô¨Çeeing workers were several supervisors in charge of 
safety and emergencies, which added to the confusion. 
On the fourth Ô¨Çoor, shell-shocked midlevel operators tele-
phoned up the chain of command for a contingency plan. 
No one answered. 
Using his mobile phone as a Ô¨Çashlight, security guard 
Kataytsev found his way to an exit and made for higher 
ground. At the crest of the dam, he and several other 
employees struggled to manually close the penstock 
intake gates. By 9:30 am they had sealed all the gates, and 
the destruction below ceased.

through 620-foot-long penÔ¨Üocks to power 10 turbines, which generate 
up to 6400 megawatts. Turbine 2 had been oÔ¨Ñine until the previ-
ous night, when it was brought online to compensate for energy loÔ¨Ü 
because of a Ô¨Åre at another plant. Here‚Äôs how the disaÔ¨Üer unfolded.

Fatigued by vibration, Turbine 
2‚Äôs faÔ¨Üening pins break at 8:13 
am. Water rushing down the 
penÔ¨Üock forces the 1500-ton 
unit through the turbine-hall 
Ô¨Çoor and 50 feet into the air.
He automated safety syÔ¨Üem 
also fails. Turbines 7 and 9 con-
tinue to operate even though 
they are submerged, causing 
short circuits, explosions and 
Ô¨ÜruLural damage. 
In the wake of the accident, rescue crews mobilized to 
search for survivors. RusHydro, the partially state-owned 
utility company that operates Sayano-Shushenskaya, 
assembled 400 employees to pump out the Ô¨Çooded tur-
bine hall and pick through the twisted debris. Russian 
president Dmitry Medvedev dispatched Sergei Shoigu, his 
emergencies minister, and Sergei Shmatko, the energy 
minister, to oversee rescue efforts. Environmental clean-
up crews attempted to contain the oil spill that stretched 
50 miles down the Yenisei River and killed 400 tons of Ô¨Åsh 
at trout farms. Over two weeks, 2000 rescuers removed 
177,000 cubic feet of debris, pumped 73 million gallons of 
water and pulled 14 survivors from the wreckage. But 75 
workers‚Äîthose trapped in the turbine hall and in the 
Ô¨Çooded rooms below‚Äîweren‚Äôt so lucky. 
For Russians, the catastrophe called to mind the 1986 
disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, 
which was then part of the Soviet Union. Speaking on a 
Moscow radio station, Shoigu called the hydro dam acci-
dent ‚Äúthe biggest man-made emergency situation [in] the 
past 25 years‚Äîfor its scale of destruction, for the scale of 
losses it entails for our energy industry and our economy.‚Äù 
Some commentators have called the events at Sayano-
Shushenskaya the ‚ÄúRussian Chernobyl.‚Äù And just as Cher-
nobyl raised questions globally about nuclear safety, 
Sayano-Shushenskaya has made other nations wonder: 
Are other hydropower plants at risk?

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT, RUSSIA‚ÄôS 
Federal Service for Ecological, Technological, and Nuclear 
Supervision (Rostekhnadzor) launched an investigation. 
The ofÔ¨Åcial report, released on Oct. 3, blamed poor man-
agement and technical Ô¨Çaws for the accident. 
According to the report, repairs on Turbine 2 were con-
ducted from January to March 2009, and a new automatic 
control system‚Äîmeant to slow or speed up the turbine to 
match output to fluctuations in power demand‚Äîwas 
installed. On March 16, the repaired turbine resumed 
operation. But it still didn‚Äôt work right: The amplitude of 
the machine‚Äôs vibrations increased to an unsafe level 
between April and July. The unit was taken ofÔ¨Çine until 
Aug. 16, when the Bratsk Ô¨Åre forced managers at Sayano-
Shushenskaya to push the turbine into service. 
Back in operation, Turbine 2 vibrated at four times the 
maximum limit. As the control system decreased the tur-
bine‚Äôs output on the morning of Aug. 17, the vibrations 
increased. The unit acted like the engine of an automobile 
being downshifted on a hill, shuddering violently and 
stressing the fatigued metal pins holding it in place. LMZ,

the St. Petersburg metalworks that manufactured the 
plant‚Äôs turbines, gave the units a 30-year service life. Tur-
bine 2‚Äôs age on Aug. 17 was 29 years, 10 months. Investi-
gators determined that the power failure after the initial 
explosion had knocked out the safety system that should 
have shut down the plant‚Äîand a malfunction turned 
into a catastrophe.
Officials from RusHydro and the government have 
called for more stringent oversight of hydropower plants, 
but economic pressures may still put Ô¨Ånancial consider-
ations ahead of safety. Six days before rescue efforts were 
halted on Aug. 29, repairs at Sayano-Shushenskaya were 
already underway. Rebuilding will take Ô¨Åve years and cost 
approximately $1.3 billion‚Äîbut a pair of nearby alumi-
num smelters, property of global aluminum giant RusAl, 
can‚Äôt wait that long. They consumed 70 percent of the sta-
tion‚Äôs output and need replacement power to maintain 
production. RusAl and RusHydro are pressing the govern-
ment for additional Ô¨Ånancing to accelerate completion of 
a joint venture at Boguchansk on the Angara River, now in 
its 29th year of construction.

THE U.S. HAS AN INSTALLED CAPACITY OF NEARLY 
100 gigawatts and an annual production of 250 terawatt-
hours, which make it the world‚Äôs fourth largest hydroelec-
tric producer. Yet even with a water-
power history dating back to the 
19th century, and more than 2000 
such plants in operation, the U.S. 
has never had an event to match 
Sayano-Shushenskaya. 
Experts agree that a similar acci-
dent is unlikely to occur here 
because American equipment is 
held to more stringent performance 
standards and rigid inspection 
regimes. The Bureau of Reclamation 
manages 58 hydropower plants, 
which produce 44 billion kilowatt-
hours per year. Dan Drake, chief of 
the Hydraulic Equipment Group, the 
unit responsible for upkeep at iconic 
Western dams like Hoover, says 
bureau turbines are taken ofÔ¨Çine at 
the first sign of abnormal perfor-
mance, and redundant automatic 
systems are in place. ‚ÄúIf a unit were 
experiencing violent or abnormal 
vibrations,‚Äù Drake says, ‚Äúit would shut down, and the gate 
at the top of the penstock would close.‚Äù Regular equip-
ment repairs and replacement also keep dams safe. 
Russia‚Äôs immediate solution to its power problem is to 
build more dams, but that won‚Äôt Ô¨Åx a bureaucratic culture 
that seems to devalue safety. ‚ÄúIf they were running a tur-
bine with known deÔ¨Åciencies, in essence, they‚Äôre putting 
economic concerns before human-life safety factors,‚Äù says 
Eric Halpin, the special assistant for dam and levee safety 
for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, America‚Äôs largest 
hydropower operator. ‚ÄúThe principles we use are just the 
opposite. If it‚Äôs not safe, if there‚Äôs a risk of failure, all other 
beneÔ¨Åts‚Äîbe they economic, environmental or anything 
else‚Äîthose all go away.‚Äù

¬í Spring is Ô¨Üill many weeks away, 
but you can get a Ô¨Üart on a bountiful 
summer garden by building a cold 
frame now, in the depths of winter. It‚Äôs 
a simple carpentry projeP that takes 
advantage of passive solar heating to 
eÔ¨ÄePively turn the calendar ahead.  
Early Risers
THE GROWING SEASON CAN 
START LONG BEFORE WARM 
WEATHER HITS‚ÄîALL IT TAKES IS A 
COLD FRAME. BY JOSEPH TRUINI
Essentially, a cold frame is a minia-
ture greenhouse‚Äîa bottomless box 
with a clear lid that captures sunlight, 
insulates plants and warms the soil. 
Lynn Ocone, a gardening expert and an 
author, uses her cold frame every year 
at her home in chilly Burlington, Vt.

‚ÄúLong before spring arrives,  
I Ô¨Üart plants indoors under 
grow lights and then move 
them out to the cold frame 
after the last of the hard 
froÔ¨Üs,‚Äù she says. Ocone has 
two recommendations for 
late-winter or early-spring 
gardeners. FirÔ¨Ü, position the 
cold frame with its clear lid 
facing south. ‚ÄúA south-facing 
cold frame captures the 
moÔ¨Ü solar energy and helps 
keep plants warmer longer,‚Äù 
she says. Second, make it 
light enough to be portable. 
‚ÄúMost people put a cold 
frame in one spot and never 
move it, which is Ô¨Åne,‚Äù Ocone 
says. ‚ÄúBut occasionally it‚Äôs 
nice to be able to move it 
into the garden and Ô¨Üart the 
plants right in the soil.‚Äù 
Cutting the Parts
¬í The body of the cold 
frame I built for my own 
backyard is made up of 
tongue-and-groove red cedar 1 x 8 lum-
ber held together with screws and verti-
cal 1 x 4 cedar battens. Ne material is 
lightweight and naturally resiÔ¨Üant to rot 
and bugs. Ne lid is 2 x 2 cedar, grooved 
to accept a clear acrylic plaÔ¨Üic panel. 
I Ô¨Üarted by using a power miter saw 
to crosscut 1 x 8s for the two side pan-
els. For each panel, I cut three 30-inch-
long 1 x 8s and one 15-inch 1 x 8. 
Next, I used a table saw to rip oÔ¨Ä the 
groove from the bottom edge of two of 
the 30-inch-long 1 x 8s, but you could 
juÔ¨Ü as easily use a circular saw. Nose 
grooveless pieces serve as the bottom 
panel on the sides.
Nen I formed each side by tapping 
together three 30-inch 1 x 8s, topped 
with one 15-inch 1 x 8.  
Next, I attached two cedar 1 x 4 bat-
tens to the inside of each side panel 
using waterproof carpenter‚Äôs glue and 
1¬º-inch galvanized decking screws.  
It‚Äôs important to position each batten  
¬æ inch from the edge of the sides.  
Nat recess accepts the front and rear

panels. I then trimmed each side panel 
to 25 degrees with a circular saw.
I cut six cedar 1 x 8s to 46¬Ω inches 
long for assembling the cold frame‚Äôs 
rear and front panels. As with the sides, 
I Ô¨Üarted by ripping the groove oÔ¨Ä two  
1 x 8s, but I also bevel-ripped the tongue 
oÔ¨Ä two other 1 x 8s to serve as the top 
boards. Ney provide a sloping edge for 
the lid to reÔ¨Ü againÔ¨Ü.
Assembling the Cold Frame 
¬í‡∏ÄI began assembly by using 2¬Ω-inch-
long decking screws to faÔ¨Üen the two 
front boards to the side panels. I drove 
screws through the front of the boards 
and into the edge of the 1 x 4 battens. I 
also drove screws through the side 
panel and into the ends of the front-
panel boards. This double-direction 
method creates an incredibly strong, 
long-laÔ¨Üing corner joint. Ne same tech-
nique was used to attach the rear of the 
cold frame to the side panels.
With the body of the cold frame 
completed, I screwed the hinge cleat to

and the lid hinges are screwed to it. 
Nen I cut two small shelf cleats and 
attached them to the rear batten. By 
placing a small 1 x 4 shelf between the 
cleats, I can Ô¨Åt another row of plants 
into the cold frame, increasing its Ô¨Üor-
age capacity without unduly shading 
the plants below. It‚Äôs a simple trick that 
a Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü-time builder may overlook.

a pair of 2¬Ω-inch trim-head 
decking screws at each cor-
ner joint. I bored pilot holes, 
to avoid splitting the 2 x 2s, 
and reinforced the lid with a 
3 x 3‚Äìinch metal bracket in 
each corner.
Next, I squeezed a con-
tinuous bead of clear silicone 
adhesive into the grooves 
in the frame parts and 
across the upper surface of 
the bottom rail. I slid the 
acrylic panel into the grooves 
until it was flush with the 
bottom rail, and then 
clamped it and allowed the 
silicone to cure overnight.
Finishing Up, 
Digging In
¬í I faÔ¨Üened the lid to the 
cold frame with two 3-inch 
galvanized butt hinges, each 
of which was attached to 
the beveled back cleat. I then 
set the lid onto the cold frame and 
screwed the hinges to the cleat.
A cold frame is designed to proteI 
plants from the cold, but the interior can 
get so hot that the plants will die. Je 
moÔ¨Ü common way to avoid this prob-
lem is to simply prop open the lid with a 
Ô¨Üick. However, a more convenient way 
to ventilate is with an automatic cold-
frame opener ($60 at www.master
gardening.com; Item: TOO-1023), which 
automatically raises the lid when the 
temperature inside gets too high. 
Je opener has a liquid-Ô¨Ålled piÔ¨Üon 
that expands when warm and contraIs 
when cold, opening and closing the lid 
in the process. It can be adjusted to 
expand at any temperature between 60 
and 140 F. It has a liXing capacity of 
15¬Ω pounds and will open the lid up to 
18 inches high.
With the opener inÔ¨Üalled, I dug the 
cold frame into the lawn against a 
south-facing Ô¨Üone wall. Je wall pro-
vides a little wind proteIion, but I Ô¨Üill 
dug down about 4 inches to keep the 
wind from blowing in from underneath 
and to increase heat retention.
Jen I Ô¨Üarted adding plants. It‚Äôs a 
satisfying feeling on a chilly day to put 
your next crop into a cold frame. Spring 
doesn‚Äôt seem so far away aXer all.
FC
Next, I began work on the lid by cut-
ting cedar 2 x 2s to length. Using 
the table saw, I cut a 1‚ÅÑ8-inch-wide x 
5‚ÅÑ8-inch-deep groove into the two side 
pieces and top rail, but not into the bot-
tom rail. It‚Äôs important to note that the 
grooves aren‚Äôt centered on the 2 x 2s, 
but inÔ¨Üead are positioned 3‚ÅÑ8 inch from 
the top surface. 
I then ripped the bottom rail to 
1 inch thick, and here‚Äôs why: Making the 
bottom rail thinner than the other parts 
allows the clear acrylic panel to overlap 
the bottom rail. That way, rain will 
cascade right oÔ¨Ä the lid without dam-
ming up against the bottom frame 
member. Not only would that puddle 
eventually rot the lid‚Äôs bottom rail, but it 
also could cause a leak at that point‚Äî
and then the dripping water might dam-
age the plants inside.

Q 
My garage Ô¨Çoor is slippery when slush melts oÔ¨Ä the 
cars, which is bad news because I back the cars out 
and use the garage as a shop. Will painting the Ô¨Çoor make 
it less slippery? Ie step on my garden tractor is also slick, 
especially when wet. I‚Äôm used to it, but my wife skinned 
her shin when she slipped on it. Now she won‚Äôt use the 
tractor. Please suggest some solutions. Ianks.
Slippery When Wet
S T U D I O  D
A
It makes sense to correct these 
problems. Slip-and-fall accidents 
kill thousands of people every year 
and injure thousands more. In 2004, 
that amounted to about 18,000 
deaths, according to the National 
Safety Council, a nonproÔ¨Åt organiza-
tion dedicated to eliminating these 
and similar hazards.
Fortunately, the Ô¨Åx is easy.
‚ÄúFrom an engineering point of view, 
there‚Äôs required fri^ion [the fri^ion a 
person needs to walk safely] and the 
available fri^ion [the fri^ion the Ô¨Çoor 
surface presents to the person],‚Äù says 
April Chambers, lab manager at the 
University of Pittsburgh‚Äôs Human 
Movement and Balance Laboratory. 
‚ÄúYour Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü goal to prevent a slipping 
accident is to ensure that available fric-
tion is greater than required fri^ion.‚Äù 
Translation: Add fri^ion, add safety.
How aggressively you treat the sur-
face depends on the severity of the slip 
hazard. In the case of your garage Ô¨Çoor, 
I would treat it very aggressively, 
because a smooth concrete surface 
that has slush and water on it is almoÔ¨Ü 
as slippery as a surface can get. One 
solution is to apply rows of nonslip 
tape that has a very coarse, abrasive 
particle bonded to its face. One of the 
beÔ¨Ü is 3M‚Äôs Safety-Walk; it‚Äôs available 
by Roy Berendsohn
Adding a 
pound of sand 
to a gallon 
of Ô¨Çoor paint 
creates a 
slip-resiÔ¨Üant 
coating. 

P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M   |   F E B R U A R Y  2 0 1 0   85
in various levels of coarseness to suit 
the speciÔ¨Åcs of the application. I‚Äôd use 
the 700 series because it has the rough-
eÔ¨Ü surface and it resiÔ¨Üs moiÔ¨Üure. You 
can also use it on the footing surfaces of 
tra>ors and trailers and on boat decks 
and docks. Porous surfaces need to be 
sealed with 3M Safety-Walk primer 
before the tape is applied. 
Chambers cautions, however, that 
you never want to increase fri>ion in 
a manner that creates a false sense 
of security. Iat is, taping one se>ion 
of a slippery Ô¨Çoor but not another can 
a>ually increase the chance of a fall 
as someone Ô¨Üeps from a secure high-
fri>ion surface to one that‚Äôs slippery.
A good way to uniformly increase 
the friction of a large area is to add 
abrasive particles to Ô¨Çoor paint. Skid-
Tex is a Ô¨Åne-grained silica sand that you 
can add to Ô¨Çoor paint at the ratio of 
1 pound per gallon. You simply Ô¨Üir it in 
and then paint as normal.
Adding Space
Like moÔ¨Ü 1950s houses, ours is short 
on Ô¨Üorage space, so I want to build a 
couple of closets. Should be pretty 
simple‚Äîtwo walls and a door. Right?
Yes. Building closets is simple, and the 
proje> is pretty much as you describe 
it. Before you build closets, though, be 
sure that you‚Äôve made maximum use of 
exiÔ¨Üing closet space. Iere are lots of 
ways to do this, from building eÔ¨Écient 
plywood shelving and dividers to inÔ¨Üall-
ing fa>ory-made Ô¨Üorage hardware.
Assuming you go ahead with the 
proje>, there are a few things to keep 
in mind. FirÔ¨Ü, if you‚Äôll be using fa>ory-
made closet hardware inside the closet, 
size the closet‚Äôs length and width 
accordingly. Also, if you use a Ô¨Üandard 
hinged door, you have to account for 
the door‚Äôs sweep into the room. Your 
other alternatives are bifold doors or 
hanging closet doors, more pra>ical 
alternatives for moÔ¨Ü rooms because 
they don‚Äôt take up additional floor 
space for a swinging door.
A dark closet isn‚Äôt particularly useful, 
so you‚Äôll have to think about lighting it. 
Go to popularmechanics.com and see 
the article ‚ÄúYour 6-Step A>ion Plan to 
Brighter Closets.‚Äù
Framing the closets will be Ô¨Üraight-
forward carpentry. It‚Äôs unnecessary to 
use 2 x 4 lumber for this job. Iis fram-
ing is wider and Ô¨Üronger than is needed 
for a closet, and you gain square inches 
of closet volume by using 2 x 3s. 
FirÔ¨Ü, carefully measure the Ô¨Çoor-to-
ceiling height in several places and 
make the wall Ô¨Üuds 3¬º inches shorter 
than that dimension. Iis accounts for 
the thickness of two horizontal wall 
plates and ¬º inch of air space to pre-
vent the wall from getting Ô¨Üuck in place 
as you pivot it into position (which can 
lead to Ô¨Çoor and ceiling damage). If the 
Ô¨Çoors and ceiling look wavy, allow for 
more airspace than ¬º inch. Not to bela-
bor the point, but it‚Äôs not a bad idea to 
cut a teÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üick from a piece of 2 x 3 (to 
serve as a model of the wall being 
raised) and try pivoting it into place 
along several locations where the closet 
walls will be built. Ie lumber won‚Äôt be 
wasted. Removing 3¬º inches from it 
turns it into a wall Ô¨Üud.
Shim the walls into place so that 
they are plumb and drive screws into 
the Ô¨Çoor and ceiling to hold everything

Some years ago, I was cutting dovetails in a mahogany 
cheÔ¨Ü. Ie Ô¨Çoor was littered with blocks of waÔ¨Üe wood. I 
slipped on one and fell forward while holding the dovetail 
saw in my right hand. Ie saw raced down my leP forearm, 
over my wriÔ¨Ü, down my hand and over the tip of my index 
Ô¨Ånger, splitting the nail in half. To avoid slips, juÔ¨Ü remember 
SLP: Sweep up, light up and pick up.  
¬í‡∏ÄSweep Up. 
Don‚Äôt let sawduÔ¨Ü, 
planer shavings, 
wood chunks, 
metal Ô¨Ålings or 
demolition debris 
accumulate where 
you work. Take a 
break and clear the 
Ô¨Çoor as you work, 
and again when 
the job is done.

¬í‡∏ÄLight Up. 
A dimly lighted area 
conceals hazards, 
especially at Ô¨Çoor 
level. Iat‚Äôs 
particularly 
dangerous in a work 
area where you‚Äôll 
likely be handling 
power tools. Light 
should be dire[ed 
from above and 
from one side to Ô¨Åll 
in shadows.
¬í‡∏ÄPick Up. 
Stow boxes, work 
materials and 
subassemblies on 
shelves and 
sawhorses. It 
seems Ô¨Ürange to 
think of the humble 
sawhorse as a 
safety aid, but it is.

every opportunity 
and use pairs of

Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä oÔ¨Ä the Ô¨Çoor.
in position. If the wall plates at the ceil-
ing don‚Äôt fall where there‚Äôs framing, use 
hollow wall faÔ¨Üeners to anchor them.
Cold Storage
I‚Äôm in the process of building a 10 x 12 
nonheated shed to Ô¨Üore my lawn 
mower and yard tools, and I‚Äôm 
wondering whether I can Ô¨Üore hand 
and power tools in there, too, 
especially cordless tools. It gets cold 
here in Minnesota, sometimes going 
down to minus 40 F. 
A shed is good for Ô¨Üoring a lot of things, 
but not hand and power tools. I‚Äôve had 
cordless and corded tools survive nights 
in an ice-cold truck, job site or garage. 
But those tools also died an early death. 
Why subject expensive tools to the 
wide swings of heat, cold and humidity 
that a shed experiences? Iat amounts 
to an accelerated wear cycle, a bit like a 
torture teÔ¨Ü in a lab.
Another compelling reason not to 
Ô¨Üore hand and power tools in a shed is 
that if you need them when it‚Äôs really 

cold, you have to bring them inside and 
let them thaw out before using them. 
Finally, most sheds are used to 
shelter lawn and pool chemicals‚Äîcor-
rosive subÔ¨Üances. I recently pulled out 
a garden trowel that was Ô¨Üored near 
some fertilizers and herbicides. The 
trowel‚Äôs blade was severely rotted, and 
the tool was ruined. Lesson learned.
P H O T O G R A P H  B Y  J  M U C K L E / S T U D I O  D
Some people have a 
knack for Ô¨Ånding 
money, four-leaf 
clovers or arrow-
heads. With me, it‚Äôs tools. It 
Ô¨Üarted one day when I was a kid 
walking in the woods behind my 
house. I caught a glimpse of an 
odd shape and Ô¨Åshed out a ruÔ¨Üy 
ball-peen hammer from the 
leaves. I went home and cleaned 
it up with sandpaper, painted the 
head and applied linseed oil to its 
handle. Sen I presented it to my 
dad, who hung it on the pegboard 
above the workbench that we 
built together.
Here‚Äôs another one: a 
linesman screwdriver I found 
lying on the shoulder of the road. 
Se tool was brand spanking 
new, and I was pleased to see 
that it had a shaU running fully 
through its handle. Not needing 
another screwdriver, I put it to 
work as painting equipment. I 
admit, that‚Äôs not particularly 
Ô¨Åtting for such a well-built tool, 
but it really pops a paint-can lid, 
and the butt of its handle thumps 
the lid down. Sere are others‚Äîa 
tack puller I found in a gutter and 
pliers I found under a dryer. 
Found tools have rounded out 
my tool colleZion, especially with 
Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä I wouldn‚Äôt have bought. So 
keep a sharp eye cocked for a 
glimpse of shiny Ô¨Üeel or ruÔ¨Ü. It 
may be the next great addition to 
your toolbox.  ‚Äî R.B.

Drill Down 
I need to buy some drill bits, and  
I‚Äôm wondering what kind I should 
get, especially for drilling metal. 
Would you agree that cobalt  
bits are the beÔ¨Ü? 
Your beÔ¨Ü bet is to get a set of general-
 purpose twist drills made from M2 
high-speed Ô¨Üeel (HSS). It contains a 
rich blend of Ô¨Üeel-improving elements, 
such as carbon, tungÔ¨Üen, molybde-
num, chromium and vanadium. 
Sounds exotic, but it‚Äôs really pretty 
common Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä, widely used in cutting 
tools. It juÔ¨Ü so happens to be excep-
tionally tough and wear-resiÔ¨Üant and 
ideal for drill bits. Here are two other 
types of HSS Ô¨Üeel used in drill bits: 
M7 and M42, both designed for indus-
trial users, especially the M42 variety, 
which contains cobalt. Hose bits are 
tough enough to drill quickly into 
tough materials like cast iron and 
Ô¨Üainless Ô¨Üeel. While that sounds like 
a handy capability, it comes at a price. 
Cobalt bits coÔ¨Ü Ô¨Åve to six times what 
Ô¨Üandard M2 bits coÔ¨Ü.
For almost all homeowner pur-
poses, the garden-variety M2 HSS type 
works juÔ¨Ü as well and doesn‚Äôt coÔ¨Ü a 
fortune. A set of 13 bits from 1/16 inch 
to ¬º inch (in 1/64 -inch increments) coÔ¨Üs 
about $10. For your money, you also 
get a fold-down case, so the bits don‚Äôt 
get loÔ¨Ü and dulled rolling around in the 
bottom of your toolbox. Hese bits are 
typically sold with a cone-shaped tip 
that measures 118 degrees, a good 
general-purpose tip.
Dripping Faucet
I have a freeze-proof faucet on the 
side of my house that drips. How do  
I repair it? 
Now that cold weather is settling in, 
this is one repair you better hop on, 
because if that dripping water freezes, 
it can damage the faucet and lead to a

really freeze-proof; under truly deep-freeze 
conditions, even a well-prote]ed faucet 
might freeze) is like a standard faucet, 
except that it‚Äôs an exceptionally long- 
Ô¨Åtting one. When you turn the handle on 
the outside of the house, you‚Äôre also turn-
ing a Ô¨Üem (a rod to which the handle is 
connected). The stem may be 6 to 30 
 inches; that‚Äôs long enough to reach into 
the house to a point where water at the 
base of the Ô¨Üem will not freeze.
On the end of the Ô¨Üem is a washer, 
which bears againÔ¨Ü a faucet seat. If the 
washer is worn, water will leak paÔ¨Ü it

IF YOUR ENGINE‚ÄôS TEMP GAUGE IS PEGGED, IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR 
A NEW RADIATOR. HERE‚ÄôS HOW TO MAKE THE SWAP. BY MIKE ALLEN
 A competent Saturday Mechanic 
can relatively easily diagnose auto-
motive maladies that are heard or 
felt‚Äîbut smells are more difficult. 
Say you‚Äôre cruising along and notice 
a Ô¨Ürange whiÔ¨Ä of ‚Ä¶ something. It‚Äôs 
an unnaturally sweet and puzzling 
odor. But aTer you round the next 
corner, it‚Äôs gone. As the road Ô¨Üraight-
ens out again, it‚Äôs back. It‚Äôs like some-
one has set a towel soaked in maple 
syrup on fire. Within a few more 
miles, that whiff of sweetness has

become cloyingly overwhelming. Soon, 
it‚Äôs clear what the problem is: That 
Ô¨Üench is coolant, leaking underhood 
somewhere from the cooling syÔ¨Üem. 
Sure enough, before you manage to 
scoot home, the temperature gauge 
Ô¨Üarts to creep upward and small curls 
of Ô¨Üeam are peeking out of the grille. 
A@er letting things cool oÔ¨Ä for a half-
hour, you gingerly open the hood, 
expeDing to see something obvious, 
like a loose cap or a split hose. 
Not a chance, pal. Fere‚Äôs dragon-
vomit-green coolant everywhere. Next 
Ô¨Üep, hose everything down with fresh 
water and let it all dry oÔ¨Ä. A quick cou-
ple of quarts of water added to the 
radiator will let you Ô¨Üart the car with-
out baking the engine. But before you 
put the hose away, water Ô¨Üarts to drip 
from the radiator. It‚Äôs immediately 
apparent where the leak is‚Äîbilious 
green coolant is seeping from a crack 
in the plaÔ¨Üic end tank. Your radiator is 
(sorry) cooked.
You Can‚Äôt Patch PlaÔ¨Üic
 When aluminum-and-plaÔ¨Üic radia-
tors Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü hit the market a generation 
ago, people actually tried to repair 
them. Fere was the obvious Ô¨Åx of sim-
ply epoxying up the cracks‚Äîhey, it‚Äôs 
juÔ¨Ü plaÔ¨Üic. If I can patch a plaÔ¨Üic gas 
tank, fender or even a windshield 
washer reservoir, I should be able to 
plug up a little crack less than an inch 
long, right?
Wrong. Trust me, I‚Äôve tried this‚Äî
usually late at night when I needed to 
get something back on the road and the 
parts were Ô¨Üill days away from arriving. 
It‚Äôs a waste of time. The plastic tank 
Ô¨Çexes too much with the heat and pres-
sure, and any adhesive juÔ¨Ü gives up. 
Besides, the tank‚Äôs glass-reinforced 
nylon Ô¨ÜruDure has likely grown brittle 
over the years. Another crack will 
appear nearby fairly soon. 
Again, when plaÔ¨Üic-tank radiators 
were Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü introduced, a lot of dealer-
ships tried to fix them. One failure 
mode, in addition to our aforemen-
tioned cracked tank, was in the long 
O-ring seal between the aluminum radi-
ator and the plastic end tanks. The 
repair involved uncrimping the steel  
Ô¨Ånger clamp holding the two together, 
replacing the tank or O-ring and crimp-
ing it all together. (I even have a special 
pair of uncrimping-crimping pliers in my 
toolbox for the job.) This repair has 
become less common because radia-
tors are now far less expensive than 
they once were.
Bottom line: If you have a bad 
plaÔ¨Üic- tank radiator, you might as well 
juÔ¨Ü buy a new one. If you have a copper-
and-brass radiator, it might be repair-
able at a radiator shop. Either way, save 
some money by doing the removal and 
inÔ¨Üallation yourself. 
Let It Bleed
 Start by draining the coolant. Now, 
do I need to tell you to let the car cool 
oÔ¨Ä Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü? Didn‚Äôt think so. You‚Äôre sup-
posed to recycle this Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä, and moÔ¨Ü 
GM dealerships have a coolant-recy-
cling machine. (GM is big on recycling 
and made all its dealers buy coolant-
recycling machines a few years back.) 
Don‚Äôt use the same drain pan you use 
for oil and transmission Ô¨Çuid‚Äîeven a 
few drops of oil will contaminate used

1. 7e Suburban 
radiator we 
transplanted for 
this Ô¨Üory, like those 
of many vehicles, 
has a radiator drain 
cock that is cleverly 
aimed direOly at a 
frame rail, which 
makes the Ô¨Üream 
of coolant splash 
and dribble over a 
1-yard-wide area.  
You‚Äôd need a kiddie 
pool to catch it all. 
2. Loosen the 
clamps on the 
coolant hoses and 
carefully pry the 
hoses oÔ¨Ä the spouts 
on the end tanks. 
Consider changing 
the hoses, which 
have a normal 
service life of Ô¨Åve to  
seven years. 
3. 7e Ô¨Üeel cooler 
lines are attached 
with thin Ô¨Üeel or 
brass hex Ô¨Åttings. 
It‚Äôs always beÔ¨Ü to 
use the right 
tool‚Äîin this case,  
a Ô¨Çare-nut wrench 
that will grip all  
six of the Ô¨Åtting‚Äôs 
corners, not  
juÔ¨Ü two.

coolant, which then has to be disposed 
of as hazardous waÔ¨Üe. Call your local 
department of public works or fire 
department for advice on disposal. 
Flushing it down the drain or using it to 
kill weeds isn‚Äôt acceptable.
Don‚Äôt leave any used coolant lying 
around. @e glycol-based liquid has a 
syrupy-sweet taste, and children and 
pets need ingeÔ¨Ü only a few spoonfuls 
to kill them. MoÔ¨Ü coolant on the market 
today has been treated with an 
extremely bitter taÔ¨Üe to prevent fatali-
ties. Soak up any small spills with kitty 
litter, sawduÔ¨Ü or sand, and dispose of 
the sweepings properly.
When the coolant has Ô¨Üopped drip-
ping, swap drain pans. MoÔ¨Ü automatic 
transmission vehicles have a transmis-
sion-oil cooler in the radiator, and our 
photo truck also has an engine-oil 
 cooler. Remove these lines, either by 
undoing the hose clamp on the Ô¨Åttings 
or unscrewing them. Cap these hoses 
to keep foreign matter out and expeI a 
few ounces of ATF or oil to dribble from 
the lower port on the radiator into your 
catch pan. Stubborn radiator hoses 
may need to be cut oÔ¨Ä. 
Easy Out
 See if there are any fan-shroud 
pieces to remove, but you might only 
need to undo the faÔ¨Üeners and sneak 
the radiator Ô¨Üraight up and out without 
actually removing the shroud. Don‚Äôt 
bend the fan blades, and watch for rub-
ber radiator-mounting cushions trying 
to escape by jumping under the car.
Unbox the new radiator and give the 
old and new radiators the hairy-eyeball 
side-by-side treatment to be sure you 
have the correI one. Carefully drop the 
new radiator in place. Don‚Äôt bend any 
fins; you‚Äôll reduce the new radiator‚Äôs 
ability to rejeI heat.
Button up the clamps, reinÔ¨Üall the 
hoses and cooler Ô¨Åttings‚Äîit‚Äôs time to 
top everything oÔ¨Ä. If the hoses won‚Äôt 
slip over the spigots, try lubing with a 
little bit of coolant. If that doesn‚Äôt make 
them slip on relatively easily, it‚Äôs time 
for new hoses.
FiVy-FiVy
 O en, you can juÔ¨Ü top oÔ¨Ä the sys-
tem, fire up the engine and go. But 
many vehicles have specific bleeding 
procedures, requiring that bleeder Ô¨Åt-
tings be, well, ‚Äùburped.‚Äù In some 
inÔ¨Üances, the front of the vehicle muÔ¨Ü 
be raised up to get all the air out of the 
system. That‚Äôs because the pressure 
cap is below the higheÔ¨Ü point in the 
engine where coolant Ô¨Çows. Failure to 
get a pocket of air out of the cylinder 
head could cause overheating, so be 
sure to follow procedure. Top oÔ¨Ä the 
overÔ¨Çow tank to the COLD line, too.
Now it‚Äôs time to Ô¨Üart up the engine 
and look for leaks. Top oÔ¨Ä the transmis-
sion and engine if you spilled any when 
you disconneIed the cooler lines. 
@ere used to be one kind of coolant 
on the market. @ese days, there are 
more than a half-dozen, in a rainbow of 
colors. Your car‚Äôs manufaIurer has a 
speciÔ¨Åc recommendation, which should 
be followed. Sharp-eyed readers will 
note that we‚Äôre reÔ¨Ålling this GM vehicle 
with conventional green coolant, 
instead of the factory-recommended 
orange long-life Dex-Cool that GM 
inÔ¨Üalled at the faIory. For whatever 
reason, a previous owner had changed 
over to green, and we eleIed to con-
tinue that praIice. Dex-Cool can take a 
long time to provide corrosion protec-
tion when it hasn‚Äôt been used in the 
 syÔ¨Üem for a while; the anti-corrosion 
additives in conventional coolant work 
immediately. 
FC
4. MoÔ¨Ü radiators 
are only clamped 
into place. Remove 
the clamp bolts 
and li7 the rad out. 
5. 9ese cracks, 
the typical failure 
mode of plaÔ¨Üic 
radiator tanks, are 
not repairable. 
6. No matter how 
long you let it drip, 
there are Ô¨Üill 
several quarts of 
liquid lurking in the 
syÔ¨Üem. Now 
would be a good 
time to Ô¨Åll with 
water and Ô¨Çush 
out any old, naÔ¨Üy 
coolant. Look up 
your cooling 
syÔ¨Üem‚Äôs capacity 
in the owner‚Äôs 
manual. It might  
be as little as 12  
or as much as 22 
quarts. Divide this 
in half, and add 
that much Ô¨Üraight, 
undiluted coolant. 
Top oÔ¨Ä with 
demineralized or 
diÔ¨Üilled water, 
ensuring you‚Äôve 
got the correL 
mixture.

I‚Äôd get a new mechanic, because 
although torque wrenches do need 
to be calibrated annually (more oBen if 
they‚Äôre in daily operation or used for really critical applications like engine assembly), 
your wrench should work Ô¨Åne aBer an adjustment and a little TLC. And I‚Äôd bet this guy 
isn‚Äôt getting his torque wrench calibrated as oBen as he should, either. Expect to pay 
$25 to $35 for a decent shop to calibrate your wrench properly. I used to have both of 
my torque wrenches, a 0-to-50 B-lb and a 0-to-150 B-lb, calibrated regularly by a fel-
low who did them for all the mechanics at the local dealerships. He had a truck with 
the calibration gear in it, and on the day he would come by the dealerships, all the 
mechanics lined up like they were buying burritos from the roach coach. He charged a 
princely 10 bucks. Sadly, the price has risen, so I juÔ¨Ü picked up a Powerbuilt Digital 
Torque Adapter. It‚Äôs a small battery-powered gadget that will let you calibrate your 
own wrench, and it costs about $50. The Powerbuilt will also work in a pinch as a 
torque wrench itself, in concert with a ratchet or a Ô¨Çex handle. But I prefer to use my 
favorite clicker wrench and save the torque adapter for calibrating it. 
Keep your torque wrench clean and lubricated, and always return the scale to 
zero aBer every use to keep the internal spring from taking a set and letting the 
calibration driB.

I inherited my grandfather‚Äôs torque wrench. It‚Äôs 
still in good condition, but when I showed it to my 
mechanic, he said the wrench was so old that it was 
probably out of calibration and that I should just hang 
it on the wall as a curio. What do you think?
Highly Calibrated 
Safe Scratch Treatment
What‚Äôs your take on using rubbing 
compound to eliminate scratches? Is 
it even possible to eliminate  them? My 
car is only two years old and looks like 
it has light, hazy scratches all over it. 
So I‚Äôm not sure if the brush at the 
carwash had something in it or what. 
ae Ô¨Åx for light scratches used to be 
rubbing compound, back in the days 
before clear-coat paint. Aggressive 
compounding can completely polish 
through the thin clear layer over the 
pigment, requiring respraying. And uh, 
yes, this would be a Bad aing. aere 
are other remedies for your patina of

can‚Äôt access the rear of the area, you‚Äôll 
be forced to drill the screw head oÔ¨Ä. 
Warning: :ese screws are hardened 
and don‚Äôt drill easily‚Äîin spite of the fa= 
that they rounded off as easily as a 
block of margarine in the hot sun. Use a 
sharp drill and moderate speed or you‚Äôll 
juÔ¨Ü melt the plaÔ¨Üic tab.
And when you are purchasing 
replacement hardware to put this all 
back together, I have only one word of 
advice: Ô¨Üainless.
Water Shortage
 ree months ago, my seldom-used 
1985 Chrysler New Yorker Ô¨Üeamed 
up under the hood. When it cooled oÔ¨Ä, 
I discovered that all the coolant had 
gone. AAer reÔ¨Ålling and checking it 
regularly, I found none was leaking on 
the ground. YeÔ¨Üerday the same 
result: no coolant. Where does it go? 
Presumably it disappears only when I 
am driving.
:at coolant is leaking, for sure. And it‚Äôs 
leaking one of several possible ways. It 
could be going into a combuÔ¨Üion cham-
ber and leaving as Ô¨Üeam through the 
exhauÔ¨Ü ports. Or it‚Äôs leaking into the oil. 
A small leak would leave the oil moÔ¨Üly 
water-free, as the PCV syÔ¨Üem will pull a 
lot of moiÔ¨Üure out of the syÔ¨Üem if the 
vehicle is driven far enough to warm the 
oil to around 180 F and keep it there. 
One other possibility is that, once hot, 
it‚Äôs leaking in small amounts either 
as Ô¨Üeam or onto a hot spot (like the 
exhauÔ¨Ü manifold), where it will evapo-
rate without leaving a wet spot. Also, a 
tiny leak in the intake manifold gasket 
might get into the manifold itself, where 
a small amount of coolant could simply 
be sucked into the combuÔ¨Üion cham-
bers, turned into Ô¨Üeam and‚Äîbuh-bye. 
You hope that‚Äôs the case, because the 
other possibilities would mean pulling 
the cylinder heads to replace the head 
gaskets, which would probably cost 
more than the car is worth.
There are ways to chase these 
leaks. :e easieÔ¨Ü is to pressurize the 
cooling system with compressed air 
and liÔ¨Üen for the hissing at the exhauÔ¨Ü 
pipe, the oil Ô¨Åller cap or the top of the 
carb or throttle body. Stant and others 
make an adapter to fit the radiator 
neck with a hand pump and a gauge. 
Just pump up the system and start 
scratches, involving less-aggressive 
polishes and wax to fill in small 
scratches. Several products include 
Mothers California Gold Scratch 
Remover, Turtle Wax Scratch & Swirl 
Remover, Autoglym Paint Renovator 
and Meguiar‚Äôs Deep CryÔ¨Üal.
Frozen FaÔ¨Üeners 
I juÔ¨Ü got a sealed beam to replace the 
old headlight in my 1988 Pontiac 
Firebird. I need to remove the frame 
that holds the light in place, and my 
screws are Ô¨Üuck. I used WD-40 on 
the screws to try and loosen them, 
but they Ô¨Üill won‚Äôt come out.  e 
screws seem to have a small clamp 
behind them. What‚Äôs the beÔ¨Ü way to 
get a driver on these buggers?
Those tiny Phillips-head trim screws 
are always a pain to remove. They‚Äôre 
cheaply cad-plated, and they ruÔ¨Ü solid 
within a few months. Yours have had 20 
years of cruÔ¨Üy buildup. Penetrating oil 
usually doesn‚Äôt help much. Start by 
using a proper No. 1 or No. 2 Phillips, 
depending on the size of the screw. Give 
yourself a break by using a relatively new 
screwdriver, not one that‚Äôs already been 
used to round oÔ¨Ä hundreds of screws 
during its diÔ¨Üinguished career. Remem-
ber to push hard againÔ¨Ü the screwdriver 
to keep it seated in the screw head. Of 
course, there‚Äôs the danger of pushing 
hard enough to break the tab on the 
plaÔ¨Üic trim piece, so be careful.
When that doesn‚Äôt work, and it 
probably won‚Äôt for at leaÔ¨Ü a few of the 
screws, you may have to resort to twiÔ¨Ü-
ing the screw with Vise-Grips. No, not 
the screw head itself‚Äîthat‚Äôs recessed 
2 inches into a ¬º-inch-diameter hole. 
Try twiÔ¨Üing the shank of the screw from 
behind the clip it screws into. If you 
I turned the old pickup‚Äôs 
key and knew inÔ¨Üantly‚Äî
it was dead. Bere was 
no juice leE in the 
battery. Someone had 
rescued a garage-Ô¨Ånd 
dead battery, charged it 
and shoehorned it into 
the truck on the cheap. 
Be bad battery fried the 
aging alternator, and it 
wound up in my shop for 
a charging-syÔ¨Üem 
transplant. Hours later, 
aEer a new battery and 
alternator had been 
inÔ¨Üalled and I‚Äôd chased a 
couple of parasitic drains, 
the engine Ô¨Üill wouldn‚Äôt 
Ô¨Üart. I‚Äôd been tinkering 
around in the fuse box, so 
I Ô¨Ågured I had jiggled 
some of the shaky wiring 
harness loose. In these 
situations, one of the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
things to do is check for 
spark. JuÔ¨Ü pull a plug 
wire, clip on the spark 
q!qq
Spark Plug TeÔ¨Üer
teÔ¨Üer, crank the motor 
and look for spark 
jumping the gap, right? 
Bere‚Äôs an easier way:  
the OK Spark plug teÔ¨Üer.  
JuÔ¨Ü hold the teÔ¨Üer‚Äôs 
probe near a plug wire (or 
even near a coil-on-plug 
coil assembly) and you 
can tell if the plug is Ô¨Åring. 
It will even deteV a 
fouled plug, something a 
conventional spark-gap 
type of teÔ¨Üer won‚Äôt do 
without removing the 
plugs. It‚Äôs a huge 
time-saver. I juÔ¨Ü had to 
hold the probe near any of 
the plug wires while 
someone cranked the 
engine. I found my 
problem in the injeVion 
harness easily, knowing 
for certain I had spark. OK 
Spark means you don‚Äôt 
have to pry Ô¨Üubborn plug 
conneVors oÔ¨Ä, keeping 
you clear of the engine‚Äôs 
red-hot exhauÔ¨Ü 
manifolds.  ‚Äî M.A.

chasing leaks. Trouble is, some leaks 
only leak when the engine is up to 
operating temperature, so don‚Äôt burn 
yourself. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you 
may need to add Ô¨Çuorescent dye to 
the syÔ¨Üem and use a UV light and 
yellow goggles, CSI Miami‚ÄìÔ¨Üyle.
Troubling Transmission
I have a queÔ¨Üion about my 1997 
Eclipse Spyder (it barely has 80,000 
miles on it). Recently, when I get 
ready to leave my house, I push 
down the clutch to Ô¨Üart it and it 
seems to require way less force than 
it used to. Aen, when putting the 
transmission in reverse to back out 
of the driveway, it grinds a little. If 
you try a few times, it will eventually 
go into gear with no problem. ADer a 
few shiDs, the gearbox Ô¨Üarts to aF 
normally. What‚Äôs going on?
Your Eclipse, unlike many vehicles 
that use a mechanical linkage or a 
cable, uses a hydraulic clutch aDua-
tor. Air in the hydraulic line is keeping 
the clutch from disengaging suffi-
ciently. A few pumps will purge the 
air, but it seeps back into the maÔ¨Üer 
cylinder overnight. I‚Äôd Ô¨Üart by Ô¨Çush-
ing out the old fluid (actually, just 
DOT-3 or DOT-4 brake fluid) and 
bleeding the system thoroughly. If 
that doesn‚Äôt Ô¨Åx it, you‚Äôve got a leak 
that‚Äôs sucking in air. Rebuilding or 
replacing the maÔ¨Üer and slave cylin-
ders should cure it. 
Fuelish Solution
I have old premixed boat gas;  
8 gallons of it, mixed 50:1 with oil.  
It‚Äôs too old to use in my two-cycle 
outboard. Can I put it in my 1997 
Land Cruiser? I Ô¨Ågured I would dump 
the mix in with the tank half full and 
top it oÔ¨Ä with fresh fuel aDerward, 
or do it 4 gallons at a time for further 
dilution. Will it foul my fuel injeFors 
with that bit of oil? Or should I juÔ¨Ü 
throw it away?
Gummy, old, oxidized premix gasoline 
is a poor candidate for use in a mod-
ern, catalytic-converter-equipped car. 
Come to think of it, so is old, oxidized 
gas without the extra two-Ô¨Üroke oil, 
too. Xe oil can potentially contami-
nate an expensive cat, and any varnish 
(produced when gasoline oxidizes, in 

for the dropped power and 
low-speed miss? 
A0er further inveÔ¨Üigation, I 
found that replacing all the inje8ors 
was better than replacing juÔ¨Ü the 
faulty one. Either of these two 
individual components could have 
been defe8ive, and the cause of my 
problem. With moÔ¨Ü of the labor 
involved in accessing the fuel 
inje8ors, I felt it was more prudent 
to replace them all with new (and 
better designed) units rather than 
only one cylinder‚Äôs worth. Ae new 
ones diÔ¨Äer from the originals, in that 
the inje8or and poppet valve are 
made from metal and are an integral 
unit. Ae original GM design 
consiÔ¨Üed of plaÔ¨Üic components, 
with a solenoid se8ion and poppet 
valve that are separate from each 
other. Eight new ones obviously 
coÔ¨Ü more. However, with the 
350,000-plus miles on the original 
inje8ors, others were sure to fail in 
the near future. A0er it was all said 
and done, I had a neighbor who has 
a scan tool hook it up to read the 
codes and zero them out, juÔ¨Ü to 
make certain nothing else was 
happening that I didn‚Äôt know about.
Couldn‚Äôt have said it, or done it, better 
myself. 7e Ô¨Çat-rate book says that 
replacing a single injector takes 2.6 
hours, and only another 18 minutes to 
replace them all, so it makes sense to 
do all eight at that kind of mileage. 7e 
only thing I might add is that if you Ô¨Åxed 
the bad injeGor, the Check Engine light 
would have gone oÔ¨Ä on its own aKer a 
couple of engine Ô¨Üart‚ÄìÔ¨Üop cycles. Or 
you could have pulled the engine-con-
trol-module fuse for a few seconds, or 
even juÔ¨Ü liKed the battery negative 
poÔ¨Ü to clear the code. 
FC
the same way that oil-based paint 
cures) might foul the fuel injeGor pin-
tle valve(s), which are also not cheap 
to replace. No, the fuel filter won‚Äôt 
catch the varnish. And if it did, you‚Äôd 
need to change the Ô¨Ålter soon, and 
that usually involves removing the gas 
tank from the car, which will coÔ¨Ü far 
more than your out-of-date fuel.
Plus, there‚Äôs the problem of phase 
separation caused by water making 
any ethanol drop out of the solution. 
Odds are any fuel Ô¨Üored in a container 
that‚Äôs not perfeGly sealed will soak up 
atmospheric moiÔ¨Üure. 7is will leave 
you with a layer of water and ethanol 
in the bottom of the tank and a layer 
of cloudy gasoline Ô¨Çoating above it‚Äî
and neither layer will burn well enough 
to run your, or any other, engine. 
Adding more alcohol  (gas line drier, 
like Heet or Dri-Gas), the traditional 
solution for water in the gas, won‚Äôt 
work. 7ere‚Äôs nothing you can add to 
remove the oil or water.
 My advice? Call the local DPW or 
Ô¨Åre department and Ô¨Ånd out a safe, 
legal way to dispose of the fuel.
Self-Taught
I recently did some work on my  
old 1996 GMC pickup that had  
Ô¨Üarted to run erratically. It seemed 
to be dropping a cylinder and  
losing power. I checked for fuel  
and spark ... I pulled the plugs, etc.  
I suspe8ed a cylinder was not Ô¨Åring, 
but the plugs all worked Ô¨Åne.
Aen, I went to looking for a bad 
inje8or, without a scan tool. Well, 
using one of my R-12 Freon gauges, 
I hooked up to the fuel-pressure rail 
(Schrader-valve type). Aen I turned 
on the key and watched the 
pressure go up and remain Ô¨Üeady. 
A0er gaining access to the 
multiconne8or for the fuel 
inje8ors on top of the intake 
plenum, I one by one ran a hot lead 
jumper to each of the eight 
conne8ors. Each time I did that, 
the pressure gauge would drop as I 
opened the inje8or‚Äîexcept for one 
particular cylinder. Was that one 
cylinder the culprit and the reason

Desktop Recording Studio
WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE AND A FEW PLUG-IN INSTRUMENTS,  
ANYONE (REALLY, ANYONE) CAN BE A ROCK STAR IN HIS OWN HOME. BY GLENN DERENE

so"ware. UnderÔ¨Üanding these basics 
will help you focus your use of the so"-
ware on what‚Äôs relevant. 
Multitrack Recording 
  is is a carryover process from 
the days of analog tape, when produc-
ers would record elements of a song on 
diÔ¨Äerent tape tracks, edit them sepa-
rately, then combine everything into a 
cohesive whole. Computers have simpli-
fied this process immensely. ‚ÄúNew 
Track‚Äù is one of the easier-to-Ô¨Ånd menu 
items in moÔ¨Ü programs‚Äîso building a 
song is like layering ingredients on a 
sandwich. I Ô¨Üarted with a percussion 
line, then added a bass line on a sepa-
rate track, then another for rhythm 
inÔ¨Üruments, another track for piano, 
then vocals and so on. And, I was free to 
tinker with individual tracks without 
altering everything at once.
Musical InÔ¨Ürument  
Digital Interface (MIDI) 
 MIDI is a Ô¨Üandardized language 
that helps inÔ¨Üruments digi-
tally communicate 
I have produced my Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü single. 
It‚Äôs hardly a secret that musical pro-
duNion has been Ô¨Üriding boldly into the 
digital age over the paÔ¨Ü three decades. 
So"ware that enables inÔ¨Üruments to 
interface directly with PCs was pio-
neered in the 1980s, and current pro-
grams pack all the goodness of a full  
production studio into a laptop, with  
virtualized inÔ¨Üruments, amps, eÔ¨ÄeNs, 
mixing boards and multitrack recording 
machines all onscreen. Wis has had a 
profound eÔ¨ÄeN on the music induÔ¨Üry‚Äî
lowering the barrier to entry to the point 
where a small band with a computer, a 
microphone and a few inÔ¨Üruments can 
produce Ô¨Üudio-quality recordings. 
InÔ¨Üruments have changed, too. Much 
of the computational heavy li"ing that 
used to be done by circuitry inside digital 
keyboards and drum pads has been oÔ¨Ä-
loaded to PC-based so"ware. By turning 
inÔ¨Üruments that used to play indepen-
dently into computer- connected USB 
peripherals, manufaNurers have reduced 
the cost of some of these devices to 
within reach of the musical dabbler. 
Wat‚Äôs where I come in. 
My last formal musical instruction 
was in high school. I took a year of piano 
and drum lessons, and I have since for-
gotten far more than I ever learned. But 
the basics of drum rolls and chord pro-
gressions remained in the Ô¨Üickier regions 
of my subconscious, and I can generally 
noodle around with such inÔ¨Üruments so 
long as no sheet music is involved. 
I Ô¨Üarted by picking up KeyStudio 49, 
a so"ware‚Äìhardware combo recently 
launched by M-Audio. For $130, the kit 
comes with a 49-key MIDI USB key-
board and a mini-USB audio interface, 
as well as the company‚Äôs entry-level Pro 
Tools M-Powered Essential software. 
The software comes with more than  
60 virtual instruments, hundreds of 
loops and templated recording sessions. 
As a basic launchpad into digital music 
produNion, it‚Äôs a darn good deal; the 
keyboard alone is worth the money, 
since it can be used with multiple music 
programs.  
Digital music-production software 
can be a bit overwhelming if you‚Äôve never 
worked with it before. Much of it caters 
to the obsessive audio engineers who 
populate the music induÔ¨Üry. M-Powered 
Essential is pitched as a ‚ÄúÔ¨Üreamlined‚Äù 
version of parent company M-Audio‚Äôs 
induÔ¨Üry Ô¨Üandard Digidesign Pro Tools 
suite of so"ware. We advantage to this 
approach (as opposed to so"ware such 
as Apple‚Äôs GarageBand, which was 
designed from the ground up for new-
bies) is that once you‚Äôve learned how it 
works, you are well on your way to learn-
ing how professional music is made. We 
disadvantage is that, if you‚Äôre like me, 
you don‚Äôt give a damn how professional 
music is made, and you may end up 
grinding off several layers of tooth 
enamel trying to weed through all of the 
menus and submenus that don‚Äôt apply 
to you before Ô¨Ånding the Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä that does. 
Regardless of what software you 
pick, there are a few basic concepts 
that are common to all digi-
tal music-produNion

1. DRUM PAD MoÔ¨Ü music-produBion soDware will come with a variety of ‚Äúdrum 
kits‚Äù‚Äîsampled percussion inÔ¨Üruments that vary by genre (rock, salsa, dance, etc.). 
While you can play these on a MIDI piano or even a qwerty keyboard, a drum pad or 
digital drum set lets you break out the Ô¨Üicks. Available from Roland, Alesis, and 
Yamaha; expeB to pay between $140 to $4000 for a full set.
2. AUDIO INTERFACE To choose a USB audio interface, Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü determine what you want 
to plug in to your computer. MoÔ¨Ü have basic analog-to-digital audio converters inside to 
capture vocals and analog inÔ¨Üruments through a microphone. Others integrate MIDI 
inputs and have built-in dials for manual adjuÔ¨Üment of input levels. Available from 
Cakewalk, M-Audio and Behringer; expeB to pay between $45 and $1000.
3. MIDI KEYBOARD be moÔ¨Ü Ô¨Çexible digital music device you can buy‚Äîa MIDI 
keyboard can be made to imitate any inÔ¨Ürument imaginable. More expensive models 
have manual controls and settings‚Äîsome have onboard audio processing and can 
play independent of a PC. Available from M-Audio, Yamaha, Roland, Korg; prices 
range greatly, from $50 to $4000.

little hand-holding for beginners unfa-
miliar with the logic of the program; 
inÔ¨Üruments and eÔ¨Äe9s are buried in 
submenus that are not always clearly 
labeled. And some elements are posi-
tively annoying‚Äîthe software won‚Äôt 
even start unless you have the USB 
audio interface plugged in, and scat-
tered throughout the menus are items 
that don‚Äôt actually work but instead 
launch pop-up windows that try to up-
sell you on higher-end versions of 
M-Powered in which those features are 
a9ually fun9ional. 
After a weekend of working with 
M-Powered Essential, I decided to try 
again with software that is actually 
aimed at beginners. Apple‚Äôs Garage-
Band, Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü launched in 2004 and now in 
its Ô¨ÅOh generation, comes inÔ¨Üalled on 
all new Macs. GarageBand was obvi-
ously designed to walk you right into 
the process of music creation. It 
inÔ¨Üantly recognized the M-Audio MIDI 
keyboard. Tracks are easy to arrange, 
instruments are organized logically‚Äî
and assigning virtual inÔ¨Üruments to the 
keyboard was a snap. 
For those who juÔ¨Ü want to jam with 
a backing band, GarageBand Jam 
instantly gives you a multi-instrument 
rhythm se9ion in whatever musical Ô¨Üyle 
you sele9. And if you don‚Äôt know the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
thing about music, you can follow inÔ¨Üruc-
tions on the basics of piano or guitar, or 
download (for $5) ArtiÔ¨Ü Lessons from 
famous musicians. Sting, for inÔ¨Üance, 
will teach you to play ‚ÄúRoxanne.‚Äù 
_ere is no dire9 analog to Garage-
Band for the PC, which is a pity, since 
moÔ¨Ü people Ô¨Üill use Windows PCs, but 
there are some programs that come 
close. Sonar Music Creator ($35) is well-
priced and has a clean interface that is 
simple to use, as is AcouÔ¨Üica MixcraO 
($65)‚Äîand both programs use the pop-
ular Dire9X and VST plug-in formats. 
So aOer tinkering with multiple pro-
grams, I Ô¨Ånally got a song I‚Äôm satisÔ¨Åed 
with‚Äîat the very leaÔ¨Ü, it has a discern-
ible beginning, middle and end. I‚Äôve 
exported it to an MP3 Ô¨Åle, and it‚Äôs cur-
rently sitting on my iPod, where only I 
can liÔ¨Üen to it‚Äîfor now, the reÔ¨Ü of the 
world is safe. 
FC
with computers over interfaces such as 
USB or FireWire. Instead of sending 
a9ual sound to a PC, a MIDI control-
ler‚Äîusually a keyboard or drum pad‚Äî
sends data about pitch and intensity of 
notes, and the computer translates that 
info into sound. That allows a MIDI 
device such as my KeyStudio piano to 
fun9ion as any one of thousands of vir-
tual (sometimes called synth) instru-
ments‚Äîthese vary from the general 
(grand piano) to the highly specific 
(Modular Moog 3C). Each virtual inÔ¨Üru-
ment has soOware controls that adjuÔ¨Ü 
variables such as suÔ¨Üain, attack, delay, 
reverb, etc.
Plug-Ins 
 In digital-music parlance, the pro-
du9ion program that you use to record 
and edit your songs is called the hoÔ¨Ü 
soOware. Users can supplement that 
program with additional soOware ele-
ments such as virtual inÔ¨Üruments and 
effects, known as plug-ins. Most host 
soOware comes with a variety of virtual 
inÔ¨Üruments, eÔ¨Äe9s and loops, but users 
can add to that with third-party plug-ins. 
_is adds a lot of Ô¨Çexibility to the hoÔ¨Ü 
soOware but can also complicate and 
confuse things a bit. Plug-ins tend to be 
hoÔ¨Ü-speciÔ¨Åc (for inÔ¨Üance, plug-ins that 
worked with my M-Powered Essential 
soOware would also work with other Pro 
Tools soOware, but not with Cakewalk‚Äôs 
competing Sonar soOware), but some 
work with multiple hoÔ¨Üs. In general, the 
more plug-ins you get, the more tied to a 
particular hoÔ¨Ü platform you become.
Loops 
 All music-produBion hoÔ¨Ü soOware 
will come with a stockpile of pre-
arranged loops in a variety of catego-
ries, and they vaÔ¨Üly simplify the process 
of music creation. By using loops, you 
can quickly arrange a background mel-
ody by making tracks of simple loop 
arrangements. I, for inÔ¨Üance, can (sort 
of) play piano and (kind of) play drums, 
but I don‚Äôt know the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü thing about 
brass or wind instruments. So, by 
browsing my hoÔ¨Ü soOware and looking 
online at places like vÔ¨Üplanet.com and 
audiomastermind.com, I was able to 
grab a few diÔ¨Äerent loops of trumpets 
and clarinets and oboes or an entire 
orcheÔ¨Üra, then Ô¨Üitch them together to 
add another dimension to my song. If 
you can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd exa9ly what you want, 
some soOware lets you clip a sample 
from an exiÔ¨Üing song and use it as a 
cuÔ¨Üom loop. In fa9, there are musical 
genres in which songs are formed 
entirely of arranged loops. 
Putting It All Together 
 Digital pianos and drum pads get 
the moÔ¨Ü obvious beneÔ¨Åts from a com-
puter interface, but ele9ric guitars can 
also get a performance booÔ¨Ü. _ere are 
a few high-tech MIDI guitars that can 
interface dire9ly with computers, but 
you can plug an ordinary guitar in to a 
PC via a USB audio interface. Audio 
interfaces can get sophisticated and 
expensive, but a basic model, such as 
the Cakewalk UA-1G, can be had for 
$100. With the computer interface, you 
can bypass a conventional amp, letting 
the soOware create a virtual amp and 
effects pedals. Guitarists (admittedly, 
I‚Äôm not one of them) can get pretty 
geeky about the sound chara9eriÔ¨Üics 
of certain legendary amps, and soft-
ware engineers are juÔ¨Ü as geeky about 
faithfully reproducing them. Want to 
play your Gibson Les Paul guitar through 
an ‚Äô85 Mesa/Boogie Mark IIc+? _ere‚Äôs 
a plug-in for that.
I had far more fun with the digital 
tricks that can be applied to vocals. 
MoÔ¨Ü of the same audio interfaces that 
work with guitars also work with micro-
phones, and there are a variety of 
eÔ¨Äe9s that can change the chara9er of 
the voice or  other acouÔ¨Üic inÔ¨Üruments. 
Reverb, echo and specialized eÔ¨Äe9s‚Äî
my favorites were ‚Äúmouse voice‚Äù and 
‚Äúhelium breath‚Äù‚Äîcan add chara9er (or 
comedy) to your performance. 
I was able to piece together a work-
able song (well, depending on your  
standards‚Äîmy 11-month-old son 
seemed to like it) with M-Powered 
Essential. However, as a newbie, the 
experience was fruÔ¨Ürating. _ere‚Äôs very

Writing sheet music is hard, but using so3ware that does it for you is easy.  
With programs such as Sibelius FirÔ¨Ü ($130) from Avid, all you need to do is  
play an inÔ¨Ürument into your PC, and your computer will transcribe the notes.

Web-address URLs can be 
unwieldy beaÔ¨Üs. Click paÔ¨Ü a site‚Äôs 
home page and the Ô¨Üring of seemingly 
random letters and numbers is likely to 
Ô¨Üretch on for dozens of charaIers.
Of course, this creates a problem for 
Twitter users‚Äîthe microblogging ser-
vice limits all poÔ¨Üs to juÔ¨Ü 140 charac-
ters, and a long URL can easily eat up 
the bulk of these. 
To get around this, sites such as 
bit.ly and TinyURL oÔ¨Äer URL-shorten-
ing services. Rese enormously popular 
sites are very easy to use: Copy and 
paÔ¨Üe in the big URL, and the site spits 
out a shorter Twitter-friendly address. 
Ris shortened URL (typically under 15 
charaIers in total) aIs as a proxy link, 
redirecting Web surfers to the real 
URL. Re upshot: Twitter users (or any-
body else who doesn‚Äôt like dealing with 
massive Web addresses) can share 
links with ease.
Useful? Absolutely. But these URL
shorteners are also potentially hazard-
ous. Clicking on one of their links is like 
opening an e-mail attachment sent by a 
complete Ô¨Üranger (and you know bet-
ter than to do that, don‚Äôt you?). Re ser-
vices can be used as smokescreens for 
spammers, phishers and virus-pushers 
who can easily lead you to believe you 
are clicking on a legitimate link. 
Ris happened laÔ¨Ü June, when hack-
ers broke into the cli.gs URL-shortening 
service and redireIed a whopping 2.2 
million links. Re hacked links didn‚Äôt load 
up anybody‚Äôs computer with viruses or 
Trojans, but the incident illuÔ¨Ürated a 
severe shortcoming in how these sites 
operate. Quite simply: You don‚Äôt know 
what‚Äôs on the other end of these links, 
and it could be malicious‚Äîor at leaÔ¨Ü 
too lewd for the oÔ¨Éce. 
And URL shorteners have another 
problem. There‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll 
Ô¨Üick around. Re Web is an immense 
network of links. As shortening services 
grow in popularity, shortened URLs will 
inevitably represent a greater portion of 
the entire Web‚Äôs links. If one of these ser-
vices shuts down, it will inÔ¨Üantly result 
in an avalanche of dead links that could 
make it diÔ¨Écult to Ô¨Ånd particular pages. 
So what can you do? Unfortunately, 
It‚Äôs impossible to see where shortened URLs are sending you‚Äî
so they could a; as smokescreens for viruses and spam.
Q 
Are there any 
dangers to using 
URL-shortening services 
such as bit.ly or TinyURL?

many people simply don‚Äôt back up their 
data‚Äîa fa7 that is all the more remark-
able when one considers how inherently 
fragile spinning hard drives are, and the 
fa7 that, sooner or later, literally all of 
them (and their years of irreplaceable 
Ô¨Åles) fail. 
The easiest way to back up your 
data is to use a network attached Ô¨Üor-
age (or NAS) drive. Because they have 
the ability to automatically pull your 
computer Ô¨Åles over your home network, 
they make it easy to automatically back 
up your documents, photos, music and 
movies without having to really even 
think about it. One of the easieÔ¨Ü pro-
grams to facilitate this is Time Machine, 
which comes built into all Macs that run 
on the Leopard or Snow Leopard ver-
sion of Mac OS.
Officially, Time Machine doesn‚Äôt 
support any third-party NAS drives. But 
that hasn‚Äôt Ô¨Üopped some other com-
panies from building storage drives, 
such as the Iomega StorCenter ix2-
200, that sync up with Time Machine. 
But users should be cautious: Apple 
has been known to block such work-
arounds in the past‚Äîas it has done 
with the Palm Pre phone‚Äôs unauthor-
ized ability to sync its music library 
with iTunes‚Äîso there‚Äôs no guarantee 
that these drives will always work with 
Time Machine.  
FC
the limits of Twitter make these serv ices 
a necessity. But when you use them, it 
makes sense to exercise caution‚Äîif you 
don‚Äôt know who poÔ¨Üed or sent you a 
link, it might not be a good idea to click 
it. And if you want to make sure a link is 
accessible as far into the future as pos-
sible, consider tweeting,  e-mailing, blog-
ging or poÔ¨Üing the full version. 
In the long term, I‚Äôd like to see more 
sites move away from the obnoxiously 
long Web addresses that have made 
these services a necessity. If more sites 
Ô¨Üart using their own shorter URLs, it 
will be easier for everybody to click 
away with conÔ¨Ådence. 
Playing Nooky
I am thinking about purchasing the 
Barnes & Noble Nook e-book reader. 
My queÔ¨Üion: Does the Nook‚Äôs ability 
to ‚Äúlend‚Äù e-books to friends work with 
other e-book readers, or does it only 
work with other Nooks? 
One of the cooleÔ¨Ü features of Barnes & 
Noble‚Äôs Nook e-book reader is its Lend-
Me feature, which allows users to ‚Äúlend‚Äù 
an e-book to a friend, much like you‚Äôve 
always been able to do with real books. 
How does it work? When your e-book 
reader is near a friend‚Äôs, it can wirelessly 
beam a book to the other device. For up 
to two weeks, that book will then live on 
the other e-book reader, during which 
time it will be inaccessible to the lender 
(juÔ¨Ü like a real-life borrowed book).
Of course, this feature becomes 
more useful as more people possess 
compatible readers. So it‚Äôs reassuring 
that it does, in fa7, work with some 
non-Nook e-book readers, as long as 
they are models (such as those made by 
PlaÔ¨Üic Logic) that tap into the Barnes & 
Noble e-book-store ecosystem. One 
warning: It‚Äôs up to publishers whether 
or not they want their books to be lend-
able‚Äîso if you‚Äôre dead set on lending 
out a particular book, best to check 
whether it‚Äôs compatible before you buy. 
Circling Around
At the top of my iPhone‚Äôs screen there 
is a little circle where it usually says 
‚Äú3G.‚Äù What‚Äôs this mean?
The techy answer: Your iPhone is 
now on the GPRS data network. _e 
English translation: ‚ÄúSorry for the really 
slow data speeds.‚Äù
In a perfe7 world, all smartphones 
would always have access to faÔ¨Ü and 
reliable 3G networks. Of course, the 
problems with AT&T‚Äôs oben-overloaded 
network are well publicized, and any-
body who‚Äôs ever tried to use an iPhone 
in a dense city knows that slow speeds 
are far from unusual. So when a 3G net-
work isn‚Äôt available, an iPhone 3G or 
3GS re gresses to the slower EDGE 
(short for Enhanced Data rates for GSM 
Evolution) network, and will let you 
know by displaying a capital ‚ÄúE‚Äù at the 
top of the screen where it usually says 
‚Äú3G.‚Äù But what if even EDGE isn‚Äôt avail-
able? In those all-too-common cases, 
the phone kicks it down one more 
notch, and you‚Äôre leb with GPRS‚Äîor 
General Packet Radio Service. This 
slower data network‚ÄîsigniÔ¨Åed by the 
circle in question‚Äîshould suffice for 
sending and receiving simple text 
e-mails and is certainly better than no 
signal at all, but don‚Äôt expe7 it to be 
very useful for surÔ¨Ång the Web, Ô¨Üream-
ing music or running data-intensive 
mobile applications.
NAS Backup
Do I need to buy Apple‚Äôs Time Capsule 
network attached Ô¨Üorage drive if I 
want to take advantage of my Mac‚Äôs 
Time Machine backup program, or will 
ones from other companies work with 
it as well? 
It will never cease to amaze me how

Cody GuÔ¨Üafson drives 80,000 miles a year to visit bridges, fa=ories and coal 
silos‚Äîand then he deÔ¨Üroys them. De 27-year-old (whose father and grandfather 
are also a=ive blaÔ¨Üers) has demolished more than 75 Ô¨Üru=ures in 40 Ô¨Üates, not to 
mention 300 Minuteman II nuclear missile silos. GuÔ¨Üafson loves walking high Ô¨Üeel and 
riding in a crane basket to place explosive charges. But the real payoÔ¨Ä comes with the blaÔ¨Ü 
itself, the slow-motion milliseconds when charges explode into a lattice of smoke with a 
cheÔ¨Ü-rattling ka-boom‚Äîand the whole shebang crashes down into heaps of rubble and 
duÔ¨Ü. ‚ÄúEverybody loves blowing Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä up,‚Äù GuÔ¨Üafson says.  ‚Äî JY MURPHY

Weakened Ô¨Üeel beams require 
fewer explosives to collapse. 
GuÔ¨Üafson uses a torch that 
runs on acetylene or propane, 
burns at over 6000 F and cuts 
1‚ÅÑ2-inch-thick Ô¨Üeel at 3 feet per 
minute to create weakness.

Made of RDX (the main 
component of C4) and copper 
tubing, LSCs provide direQed 
explosions for cutting through 
Ô¨Üeel beams. GuÔ¨Üafson cuts 
a 4-inch-high window in an 
I-beam, then places four 
600-grain LSCs (which will 
each cut through 3‚ÅÑ4 inch of 
Ô¨Üeel) in the window.

To make shallow holes in con-
crete, GuÔ¨Üafson uses a drill bit 
attached to a jackhammer or 
a drill; for holes up to 160 feet 
deep, he uses a tread-mounted 
drill and tempered drill Ô¨Üeels 
conneQed end-to-end.

GuÔ¨Üafson packs holes with 
1‚ÅÑ3 pound of explosive per yard 
of concrete. Ve Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üick is 
joined to a blaÔ¨Üing cap, then 
to a fuse; temperature and 
pressure from this explo-
sion set oÔ¨Ä the other Ô¨Üicks. 
Dynamite is pretty Ô¨Üable, but 
‚Äúwhen you drop a Ô¨Üick in a 
hole, you cringe,‚Äù he says.

EleQrical aQivity wreaks 
havoc when charges are elec-
trically wired, so GuÔ¨Üafson 
uses a noneleQric shooter 
that ignites Nonel tubing, 
which burns at 8000 to 
12,000 feet per second.
