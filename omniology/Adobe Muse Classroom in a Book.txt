Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 1
If you are a graphic designer, business owner, or anyone who wants to design 
and create professional, original websites without ever touching code, Muse is 
the program you’ve been waiting for.
With Muse, you can quickly and easily design and create user-friendly, inter-
active websites, without the help of a developer. You just design your site in 
Muse using design-savvy graphic tools that leverage the same skills as Adobe 
InDesign and Photoshop. Then, after creating your site in Muse, you can take 
your site live using Adobe hosting or export to a provider of your choice, 
publishing your site as original HTML pages that conform to the latest web 
standards.
Muse really is that easy and that powerful, and Adobe Muse Classroom in a 
Book® will help you make the most of it.
about Classroom in a Book
Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book is part of the official training series for 
Adobe graphics and publishing software developed with the support of Adobe 
product experts. The lessons are designed so that you can learn at your own 
pace. If you’re new to Adobe Muse, you’ll learn the fundamentals you need to 
master to put the application to work. If you are an experienced user, you’ll 
find that Classroom in a Book teaches many advanced features, including tips 
and techniques for using the latest version of Adobe Muse.
Although each lesson provides step-by-step instructions for creating a specific 
project, there’s room for exploration and experimentation. You can follow 
the book from start to finish, or do only the lessons that correspond to your 
interests and needs. Each lesson concludes with a review section summarizing 
what you’ve covered.

ing knowledge of your computer and its operating system. Make sure that you 
know how to use the mouse and standard menus and commands, and also how to 
open, save, and close files. If you need to review these techniques, see the printed 
or online documentation included with your Microsoft Windows or Mac OS 
software.
Installing Muse
Before you begin using Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book, make sure that your 
system is set up correctly and that you’ve installed the required software and 
hardware.
The Adobe Muse software is not included on the Adobe Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD; you must purchase the software separately. For complete instructions 
on installing the software, see the Adobe Muse Read Me file on the application 
DVD or on the web at www.adobe.com/support.

Copying the Classroom in a Book files
The Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book CD includes folders containing all the elec-
tronic files for the lessons. Each lesson has its own folder. You must install these 
folders on your hard disk to use the files for the lessons.
to install the Classroom in a Book files
1 Insert the Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book CD into your CD-ROM drive.
2 Do one of the following:
• Copy the entire Lessons folder onto your hard disk (recommended).
• Copy only the specific lesson folder that you need onto your hard disk.
restoring default program preferences
The preference files control how command settings appear on your screen when you 
open the Adobe Muse program. Each time you quit Adobe Muse, the position of the 
panels and certain command settings are recorded in different preference files. If 
you want to restore the tools and settings to their original default settings, you can 
delete the current Adobe Muse preference files. Adobe Muse creates new preference 
files, if they don’t already exist, the next time you start the program and save a file.
to save current Muse preferences
If you would like to restore the current preferences for Muse after completing the 
Lessons, you can do so by following these steps:
1 Exit Adobe Muse.
2 Locate the AdobeMuse preferences folder as follows:
• (Windows) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder  
[startup drive]\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\AdobeMuse.
• (Mac OS X) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder  
[startup drive]/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/AdobeMuse.
Keep in mind that your folder name may be different depending on the language 
version you have installed. If you can’t find the file, you either haven’t started 
Adobe Muse yet or you have moved the preferences folder. The preferences 
folder is created after you open Muse the first time and is updated thereafter.
3 Copy the folder, and save it to another folder on your hard disk.
4 Start Adobe Muse.
P Note: If you 
cannot locate the 
preferences folder, use 
your operating system’s 
Find command and 
search for AdobeMuse.
P Note: The AppData 
folder may be hidden 
on Windows.

to delete current Muse preferences
If you are entering the Lessons using Jumpstart, you need to delete the current 
preference files for Muse by following these steps:
1 Exit Adobe Muse.
2 Locate the AdobeMuse folder as follows:
• (Windows) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder  
[startup drive]\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\AdobeMuse.
• (Mac OS X) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder  
[startup drive]/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/AdobeMuse.
Remember, the folder name may be different depending on the language version 
you have installed.
3 Delete the preferences folder.
4 Start Muse.
to restore saved preferences
After completing the lessons, you can restore your personalized preferences you 
saved in the “To save current Muse preferences” section, in two steps.
1 Exit Adobe Muse.
2 Find the original AdobeMuse preferences folder that you saved and replace the 
AdobeMuse folder found here:
• (Windows) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder [startup drive]\
Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\AdobeMuse.
• (Mac OS X) The AdobeMuse folder is located in the folder [startup drive]/
Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/AdobeMuse.
Again, the folder name may be different depending on the language version you 
have installed.
E Tip: To quickly 
locate and delete the 
Adobe Muse prefer-
ences folder each 
time you begin a new 
lesson, create a short-
cut (Windows) or an 
alias (Mac OS) to the 
AdobeMuse folder.
P Note: If you cannot 
locate the preferences 
folder, use your 
operating system’s 
Find command and 
search for AdobeMuse.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 5
Recommended lesson order
Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book is designed to take you from A to Z in basic to 
intermediate website design and creation. Each new lesson builds on previous 
exercises, using the files and assets you create to develop an entire website. To 
achieve a successful result and the most complete understanding of all aspects of 
web design, the ideal training scenario is to start in Lesson 1, and perform each 
lesson in sequential order through the entire book to Lesson 9. Because each lesson 
builds essential files and content for the next, you shouldn’t skip any lessons or even 
individual exercises. While ideal, this method may not be a practicable scenario 
for everyone.
Jumpstart
If you don’t have the time or inclination to perform each lesson in the book in order, 
or if you’re having difficulty with a particular lesson, you can work through indi-
vidual lessons using the jumpstart method with the files supplied on the book’s CD. 
Each lesson folder includes staged files (files that are completed to that point in the 
Lessons).
To jumpstart a lesson, follow these steps:
1 Install the fonts used in the Lessons. See the section “Fonts used in this book” 
on page 2.
2 Restore the program preferences as explained in the “To restore saved 
preferences” section on page 3.
3 Copy the Lessons folder from the Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book CD onto 
your hard drive.
4 Open Muse.
5 Choose File > Open Site and navigate to the Lessons folder on your hard drive, 
then to the specific lesson folder you are starting from. For instance, if you are 
jumpstarting Lesson 3, navigate to the Lesson03 folder in the Lessons folder and 
open the file named L3_start.muse.
For most of the lessons, you will need to open the _start file for your operating 
system due to font differences. For instance, if you are on Mac OS and want to 
jump into Lesson 8, you will open the lesson file named L8_start_mac.muse.
These simple steps will have to be repeated for each lesson you wish to jumpstart. If 
you choose the jumpstart method once, however, you do not have to continue using 
it for all subsequent lessons. For example, if you want to jumpstart Lesson 6, you 
can simply continue on to Lesson 7, and so on.
P Note:  If you see a 
dialog box indicating 
modified, missing, or 
upsampled images, 
click OK.

OS
When instructions differ by platform, Windows commands appear first and then the 
Mac OS commands, with the platform noted in parentheses. For example, you might 
see “press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and click away from the artwork.” In 
some instances, common commands may be abbreviated with the Windows com-
mands first, followed by a slash and the Mac OS commands, without any parentheti-
cal reference. For example, “press Alt/Option” or “press Ctrl/Command+click.”

To make the most of Adobe Muse, you need to know 
how to navigate the workspace. The workspace 
consists of the menu bar, Toolbox, Control panel, 
Document window, default panels, and modes.

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
a typical Muse web workflow
Before you get started with Muse, it’s a good idea to understand the typical Muse 
workflow. In a print design workflow, you use Adobe InDesign as a page layout 
tool and a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for creating 
graphics. The same holds true for creating sites in Muse, except that Muse replaces 
InDesign for the website design and creation process.
As you step into Muse, you will quickly learn that its easy-to-follow workflow is 
similar to your print design workflow, with just a few adjustments. As with most 
creative programs, the Muse workflow is flexible and easily adapts to your own 
work style. The typical Muse workflow from concept to published website is
1 Create a site concept.
2 Create your Muse site file.
3 Plan your site. Typically, this step includes
• Editing your site map (adding, organizing pages)
• Wireframing (determining content positioning)
4 Design your pages.
5 Test your pages.
6 Publish your site.
To get a sense of what you’ll be learning in the lessons that follow, take a closer look 
at each of the workflow steps.
Create a site concept
At the outset of the creation process, you need to determine the purpose of the site. 
To do so, ask those involved (like the client) such questions as
• What does your company do?
• Why are you building this site?
• What are our/my deliverables?
• Who are some competitors, and what do you like and dislike about their sites?
Obtaining answers to these questions (and more) in advance can make your cre-
ative process more efficient and ensure that you achieve all the site’s objectives. For 
most websites, investing time in some forethought and preplanning will go a long 
way toward avoiding unnecessary issues later in the process.
With the site scope, function, and goals defined, you can begin to create the site file 
in Muse.
P Note: These 
workflow steps are 
a general guide, and 
may not be the same 
for every website you 
create. Your process 
may be different. As you 
will learn, the bigger or 
more complex a site is, 
the more planning and 
preparation is typically 
needed.
E Tip: For sugges-
tions on the type of 
questions to ask clients 
in the initial stages of 
the website creation 
process, check out 
the PDF file named 
client_questions.pdf in 
the Lesson01 folder on 
the companion disc.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 11
Create your Muse site file
After coming up with the concept for your site, the first step within Muse is as easy 
as creating a new document in a program like Adobe InDesign or Illustrator.
To begin, you create a site file, which has the file extension of .muse. The site file is 
similar to an InDesign file, because it contains the pages as well as master pages for 
your entire website.
Plan your site
When you open your site in Muse, you enter Plan mode, where you can generate a 
site map. Your site map shows the number of pages in your site, how the pages will 
be ordered, and how they connect to each other in the site navigation.
set up the site Map
Creating your site map is a critical step in the website creation process, but Muse 
makes it easy. In Muse, your site map is structured like a flowchart so you can 
quickly see the relationship between parent pages, which are accessible through the 
main site navigation, and child pages, which are often available through second-tier 
menus or other navigation. In Plan mode, you see thumbnails of the pages in your 
site as well as a master page that you can use to control the consistent elements in 
your design, like header and footer content. Using simple tools in Plan mode, you 
can add and remove pages, connect pages to each other, work with master pages, 
and rearrange pages.
You can organize your site however you feel will benefit the end user the most. 
Suppose you were building a site for Kevin’s Koffee Kart. The parent pages could 
be the home page, contact page, products page, and so on. The child pages for the 

12 
lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
products parent page could be the types of products that Kevin’s Koffee Kart sells, 
like coffee, brewers, grinders, and the rest. It always helps to go out on the Web and 
look around for how companies are organizing pages in their sites. Keep in mind 
that you can edit your site map later, if your needs change, but it will guide your pro-
cess and determine the site navigation.
Wireframe your concept (recommended)
With your site map created, your next major step is to create your site design, but 
don’t jump into the designing process just yet. Taking some time now to wireframe 
your layout may ultimately save you time and make creating your site in a team 
environment easier.
A wireframe is basically the designer’s version of an outline. It shows the site struc-
ture, the positioning of such basic elements as the header, footer, sidebar, naviga-
tion, and others. The benefit of starting with a wireframe is that it gives everyone 
involved (including the client) a simple way to envision the site layout, and decide 
where content should be placed. The actual design, including fonts, colors, and 
styles, are not visible in a wireframe.
Generally speaking, you should make one wireframe for each unique page or sec-
tion on a website. You can create them in several ways from simply sketching on 
paper to using dedicated wireframing software or a program like Adobe Photoshop, 
Illustrator, or Fireworks. Once your wireframes are created and approved, you can 
more confidently add flesh to the bones of your site.
Design your pages
After you plan your site, set up a site map and, ideally, wireframe your pages, you 
can approach the page design from either of two routes. For one, you can start your 
design in a program like Photoshop or Illustrator, slice up the content, save it in the 
desired format, .jpg, .gif, or .png, then assemble the pieces in Muse (even pasting 
them directly from Photoshop).

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 13
Alternately, you can start the design stage right in Muse like you approach page 
layout in InDesign. You can then place web-supported images like .gif, .jpg, .png, 
or .psd (Photoshop) files as you design your pages. You can add text, format that 
text using familiar formatting options, and even create character and paragraph 
styles to control the text formatting throughout your site. Muse also supplies lots 
of prebuilt, but fully customizable, widgets you can drag and drop onto your pages, 
such as navigation bars, slideshows, lightboxes, and much more that you will learn 
how to use in the lessons.
Preview your pages
As you design and add content to your pages, you can use Preview mode in Muse 
to see how your site will look to visitors. In addition, you can test it in various 
browsers to ensure that your site displays and functions the way you intended.
Publish your site
The last step in the process is publishing your site. When 
your site is ready, you can share it with the world by 
either hosting it using Adobe hosting or exporting your 
site as HTML and hosting it with a different vendor of 
your choice.
Now that you’ve seen a general process for creating a Web site in Muse, it’s time to 
explore the Muse workspace.

14 
lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
touring the Workspace
In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of the Muse workspace by touring 
key features and getting familiar with some commonly used tools.
The Muse workspace shows toolbars and panels that let you view, create, and edit 
Muse documents. You can also display multiple documents in a single window with 
tabs for each document.
The workspace is an integrated document layout with panel sets that float on 
the side (or wherever you drag them on your desktop). Panel groups are initially 
docked together in default groups, but can be undocked from each other if you 
want to customize your workspace.
the Welcome screen
Before you interact with the workspace, however, you see the Welcome screen, 
which appears when you first open Muse. You can use the Welcome screen to 
learn more about Muse and access resources, such as videos, files, and more. The 
Welcome screen also lets you create a new site file, open a recent site file, or browse 
to open a site file.
1 Double-click the Adobe Muse icon to start the program. Muse opens and 
displays the Welcome screen.
E Tip: The Welcome screen appears when no site files are open. If you don’t want to see this 
dialog box when you launch Muse in the future, select Don’t Show Again in the lower-left corner of 
the Welcome screen. To have the Welcome screen appear again when you relaunch the program, 
choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Muse > Preferences (Mac OS) and select Show for the 
Welcome Screen option.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
resource folder onto 
your hard disk, on the 
Adobe Muse Classroom 
in a Book CD. See 
“Copying the Classroom 
in a Book files” on 
page 3.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 15
understanding Modes
In the upper-left corner of the Muse Application window, notice the links for three 
main modes: Plan, Design, and Preview. When you select a mode, Muse displays 
it in the Document window. Each of these modes represents a step in the website 
creation process, as the section “A typical Muse web workflow” explained.
Next, you will open an existing site and explore the Muse workspace. You will use 
the L1_start.muse file that corresponds to your operating system to practice navi-
gating, zooming, and previewing a Muse document and work area.
1 Choose File > Open Site, and open the L1_start_mac.muse (Mac OS) or 
L1_start_win.muse (Windows) file in the Lesson01 folder, located in the 
Lessons folder on your hard disk.
When you open a .muse site file, Muse displays Plan mode by default. You can 
tell that Plan mode is showing because the word “Plan” is highlighted in blue in 
the upper-left corner of the Application window.
Plan mode displays your site map (also called a site plan), which shows the pages 
in your site and how they are connected to each other. It also displays your 
master pages, which serve as templates for the pages of your site. Plan mode also 
has options that enable you to remove thumbnail previews, the master badge 
indicator, and resize thumbnails. You will explore Plan mode and its options 
further in Lesson 2 when you create your own site file.
Plan mode options

P Note: To see the 
final site that you 
will create in these 
lessons, open the

muse (Windows) or 
KoffeeKart_end_mac.
muse (Mac OS) site file 
in the Lessons folder.
P Note: The 
thumbnails you see 
in Plan mode may be 
different than what is 
shown in the figure. 
That’s okay.
P Note: The figures 
in this book are taken 
using the Mac OS 
operating system and 
position of the menus 
may be slightly different 
from what you see, 
especially if you are 
using Windows.

2 Click the Design mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window.
When you click the Design mode link, the first page of the website opens, 
and appears in a separate tab at the top left of the Document window. In this 
case, the tab for the page shows HOME. That is the name and the title of the 
page, which you will learn more about in later lessons. Design mode is where 
you create the layout for each page of your site by adding text, images, links, 
and more.
Notice that more options, tools, and panels now appear as well. Take a moment 
to familiarize yourself with the names of these workspace components.

3 Click the Plan mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window to 
return to Plan mode. Notice that the page called HOME is still open as a tab at 
the top of the Document window.
Similar to Adobe InDesign, where you need the InDesign file open to edit the 
pages in it, you must always have the .muse site file open in order to edit pages 
of the site in Design mode. If you find yourself needing to work on more than 
one site at a time, you can also open multiple .muse site files and the pages of 
those sites.
4 Click the HOME page tab to return to Design mode and see the page in the 
Document window.
E Tip: You can 
also enter Design 
mode by pressing 
Ctrl+I (Windows) or 
Command+I (Mac OS).
E Tip: You can also 
enter Plan mode by 
choosing View > Plan 
Mode or by pressing 
Ctrl+M (Windows) or 
Command+M (Mac OS).

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 17
5 Click the Preview mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window. 
The active page (HOME) opens in Preview mode.
The final mode, Preview, shows you what your page looks like in a browser. 
In Preview mode, you can essentially browse your site like your visitors will, 
including clicking and testing links, as well as viewing such interactive content 
as slideshows.
6 Click around on the page, and notice that the interactive content, like the 
animated logo at the top of the page and the image slideshow in the main area 
of the page, is working.
7 Choose View > Design Mode.
Next, you will further explore the components of Design mode.
Working in Design mode
In Design mode, you see the Toolbox, Control panel, and panel groups that float 
independently in the Application window. All of these features make up the Muse 
workspace. As with other Adobe applications, you can customize the workspace in 
Muse by manipulating some of the panels. That’s what you’ll do next.
the toolbox
In Design mode, the Muse Toolbox appears above the Control panel, and contains 
selection, cropping, type, viewing, and drawing tools. It’s an abbreviated version of 
the toolboxes from other Adobe Creative Suite components, such as InDesign CS6 
and Photoshop CS6. As you work through the lessons, you’ll learn more about the 
functions of each tool, which are
A
B
C
D
E
F
A Selection tool: Selects objects on a web page
B Crop tool: Crops images that you insert into your pages
C Text tool: Creates a text area so that you can place text on a page
D Zoom tool: Zooms in on or out from the page
E Hand tool: Pans around a page by dragging
F Rectangle tool: Creates rectangle shapes that can be used as design elements
P Note: If a font 
warning dialog box 
appears, click OK.

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
By default, the Toolbox appears as a single horizontal row of tools and cannot be 
edited or moved. As in other Adobe applications, you can select a tool from the 
Toolbox by clicking it or pressing a keyboard shortcut.
1 Position the pointer over the Zoom tool (
) in the Toolbox. Notice that Muse 
displays the tool’s name and keyboard shortcut. Click to select the Zoom tool. 
Every tool in the Toolbox has a keyboard shortcut associated with it.
2 Press the V key to select the Selection tool.
The keyboard shortcuts in Muse, like those in Adobe InDesign CS6 and Adobe 
Photoshop CS6, are spring-loaded tool shortcuts. This means that you can hold 
down a tool’s shortcut key to switch to that tool temporarily. When you are finished 
using the tool, you can simply release the shortcut key to return to the previously 
selected tool.
3 With the Selection tool selected, press and hold the H key. Notice that the 
pointer in the Document window changes to a Hand tool (
). Without releasing 
the H key, click and drag the page up or down.
4 Release the H key to return to the Selection tool once again.
Spring-loaded tool shortcuts can help you work faster, saving you time that adds 
up over the life of a project.
the Control panel
The Control panel offers quick access to options and commands related to the cur-
rent page item or objects you select. By default, Muse displays the Control panel 
horizontally across the top of the Document window; you cannot edit or move it. 
You can, however, open and close it by choosing Window > Control, if necessary. In 
the Window menu, a check mark to the left of the word “Control” indicates that the 
Control panel is open in the workspace.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 19
Options displayed in the Control panel vary depending on the type of object you 
select. As you progress through each lesson, you will also notice that some of the 
options displayed in the Control panel are also found within other panels in Muse.
When you first open a page, with nothing selected, you see the word “Page” on the 
left end of the Control panel. This is called the Selection Indicator. When you select 
content on the page, the currently selected object is named here. For example, Page 
indicates that the options currently showing in the Control panel will affect the 
large, white page box in the Document window (you will learn more about the page 
area in a later lesson).
1 With the Selection tool still selected, 
click to select the Daily Drip image in 
the upper-left portion of the page.
On the left end of the Control panel, 
you now see the words “Image Frame” 
to indicate that you selected an image 
frame on the page. Notice also that 
the options in the Control panel have 
changed. Any changes you make 
in the Control panel will affect the 
selected image.
2 Choose Edit > Deselect All to deselect 
the image.
Throughout the lessons in this book, you will be using the Control panel to format 
content on your pages and learn more about those options.
Working with panels
Panels, which are listed in the Window menu, give you quick access to many tools 
that make modifying content easier.
Panels live in the panel dock on the right side of the workspace. The panel dock is 
a collection of Muse panels displayed together in a vertical orientation. Within the 
panel dock, there are three main groups of panels. You can see the division between 
the groups as darker gray lines. Muse lets you collapse, open, and close panels, as 
well as move them around between groups within the panel dock to make more 
important panels easier to see or access.
Next, you will experiment with moving, hiding, opening, and closing panels in the 
panel dock.
1 Click the Fill panel tab on the right side of the workspace to open the panel, if it’s 
not yet open, or choose Window > Fill.
E Tip: As the options 
in the Control panel 
change, you can get 
more information 
about each option by 
hovering over an icon 
or option label with 
the pointer to view its 
tool tip.

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
2 Click the Swatches panel tab to display the Swatches panel.
Notice that the Swatches panel appears with four other panels—the Fill panel, 
Text panel, the Assets panel, and the Transform panel. These five panels are all 
part of the same panel group.
3 Drag the panel dock to the left by clicking and holding down on the dark gray 
panel dock bar at the top, making sure to avoid the double arrow on the right 
side of the panel dock bar when you click. (Clicking the double arrow will 
collapse the panel dock to icons.)
4 Drag the panel dock back to the right side of the workspace.
5 Click the Text panel tab to view the Text panel.
6 Click the Text panel tab again, and notice that the panel height decreases.
7 Click the Text panel tab once more to reveal the contents of the Text panel.
You can also rearrange the order in which the panels appear in a group. That’s 
what you’ll do next.
E Tip: A quick way 
to open a collapsed 
panel is to choose 
Window > Open All. 
You can also close all 
panels simultaneously 
by choosing Window > 
Close All. When you 
choose Close All, the 
panel dock minimizes 
to a single dark gray bar 
in the workspace.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 21
8 Click the Swatches panel tab to show the panel. Click and drag the Swatches 
panel tab to the right of the Transform panel.
9 Drag the Swatches panel back to the left of the Fill panel.
Next, you will change the height of a panel group, making it easier to see more 
of the panel contents.
10 With the Swatches panel showing, drag down the dark gray dividing line 
between the Swatches panel group and the Character Styles panel group to 
resize the group. Drag the dividing line back up.
Next, you will drag a panel from one group to another in the docked panels. This 
can help you organize like panels with each other.
P Note: You may 
not be able to drag 
the divider very far, 
depending on your 
screen size, screen 
resolution, and the 
panel showing.

22 
lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
11 Click and drag the Transform panel by the panel tab into the panel group below 
that contains the Character Styles and Paragraph Styles panels. Release the 
mouse button when the pointer is within the bounds of the panel group and 
when you see a blue outline around the entire panel group.
As you move panels, you will see blue highlighted drop zones, which are areas 
where you can move the panel. When moving panels you can also create new 
panel groups.
12 Drag the Transform panel by its tab back into the Swatches panel group. 
13 Click and drag the States panel by the panel tab up to the dark gray bar between 
the panel group that contains the Swatches panel and the panel group below it. 
Release the mouse button when you see a blue line between the panel groups, 
which indicates the drop zone.
The States panel is now docked in its own group above the Character Styles 
panel group. Creating lots of panel groups, however, can also clutter your 
workspace. One solution is to close unneeded panels.
P Note: The position 
of the mouse (rather 
than the position of 
the panel), activates 
the drop zone, so if you 
can’t see the drop zone, 
ensure that the mouse 
is positioned over the 
place where you want 
to move the panel.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 23
14 Click and drag the States panel by the panel tab down into the panel group that 
contains the Widgets Library.
15 Choose the Window menu, and you will see a listing of all of the available panels. 
The panels with a check mark to the left of their name are already open in the 
workspace.
16 Make sure that the Swatches panel is selected in the panel dock on the right 
side of the workspace and that its contents are showing. Choose Window > 
Swatches.
Selecting a panel in the Window menu that is showing in the workspace closes 
that panel, and all of the panels in the same panel group, in the panel dock.
17 Choose Window > Swatches to reopen the Swatches panel and all the other 
panels in that same panel group.
18 Choose Window > Character Styles.
When you choose a panel in the Window menu that isn’t currently showing in 
the panel dock, that panel’s contents are revealed in the panel dock.
19 Click the double arrow in the upper-right corner of the dock (in the dark gray 
bar) to collapse the panels to icons.
Much like in other Adobe applications, collapsing the panel dock to icons 
reduces clutter in your Muse workspace.
E Tip: When the panel dock is collapsed to icons, you can reposition it by dragging it by the dark 
gray dock bar at the top of the dock.
20 Click the double arrow at the top again or any of the panel icons in the dock to 
expand the entire panel dock again.
21 Click the Widgets Library panel tab to show the panel.
P Note: By default, all
of the available panels 
in Muse are in the 
workspace already. If 
there is no check mark 
next to the panel name 
in the Window menu, it 
is in the panel dock and 
not currently showing 
(the Control panel is the 
only exception).
E Tip: If you want to 
close a panel in a group, 
you can drag that panel 
by the tab to the dark 
gray bar between any 
two panel groups to 
create another panel 
group in the dock. Then 
you can choose that 
panel name from the 
Window menu and 
it will only close that 
panel.
E Tip: To hide all the 
of the panels in the 
dock, you can choose 
Window > Hide Panels. 
To show them again, 
choose Window > Show 
Panels.

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
Zooming and panning
When you’re working in pages in a site, you’ll often need to change the magnifica-
tion level and navigate between pages. To the right of the Toolbox, the zoom view 
menu displays the magnification level, which can range from 10% to 4000%. Using 
any of the viewing tools and commands affects only the display of the page, not the 
actual size of the page and contents.
1 Choose View > Zoom In to enlarge the display of the page.
2 Choose View > Zoom Out to reduce the view of the page.
E Tip: Zoom out using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+– (Windows) or Command+–(Mac OS).
Each time you choose a Zoom option, the view of the page is resized to the 
closest preset zoom level. The preset zoom levels appear in the zoom view drop-
down menu to the right of the Toolbox, identified by a down arrow next to a 
percentage.
3 Choose 200% from the zoom view menu.
4 Select the 200% in the zoom view menu field and type 20. Press Enter or Return.
You can type values in the zoom view menu that range from 10% to 4000%. 
Also, notice that you do not need to type the %.
5 Choose View > Fit Page In Window to display a reduced view of the page in the 
Document window.
The View menu is a quick route to fitting a page to your screen or viewing the 
page at actual size.
E Tip: Zoom in using 
the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+= (Windows) or 
Command+= (Mac OS).
E Tip: You can also use 
the keyboard shortcuts 
Ctrl+0 (Windows) or 
Command+0 (Mac OS) 
to fit the page in the 
Document window.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 25
6 Choose View > Actual Size to display the page at actual size.
The page displays at 100%, which is the most accurate reflection of what your 
site will look like to visitors. The actual size of your page determines how much 
of it you can see onscreen at 100%.
E Tip: You can also use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+1 (Windows) or Command+1 (Mac OS) to view 
the page at actual size (100%).
7 Choose View > Fit Page In Window before continuing to the next section.
using the Zoom tool
In addition to the View options, you can use the Zoom tool to magnify and reduce 
the view of your pages. The Zoom tool allows you to zoom into and out of specific 
areas of your pages.
1 Click the Zoom tool (
) in the Toolbox to select the tool, and then move the 
pointer into the Document window. Notice that a plus sign (+) appears at the 
center of the Zoom tool pointer.
 2 Position the Zoom tool over the Daily Drip banner on the left side of the Home 
page and click once. The artwork displays at a higher magnification.
3 Click two more times on the Daily Drip banner to increase the view again.
Notice that the specific area you clicked is magnified. You can reduce the view 
of the page in a similar manner.
4 With the Zoom tool still selected, position the pointer over the Daily Drip 
banner and hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS). A minus sign (–) 
appears at the center of the Zoom tool pointer (
).
5 With the Alt or Option key still pressed, click the artwork twice to reduce the 
view of the artwork.
For a more controlled zoom, you can drag a marquee around a specific area of 
your artwork. This magnifies only the selected area. You’ll try that next.
6 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
7 With the Zoom tool still selected, click and drag across the Daily Drip banner. 
When you see the aqua box, called a marquee, around the area you are 
dragging, release the mouse button. The marqueed area is now enlarged to fit 
the Document window.
8 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
The Zoom tool is used frequently during the editing process to enlarge and 
reduce the view of the page. Because of this, Muse allows you to select it 
using the keyboard at any time without first deselecting any other tool you 
may be using.
9 Before selecting the Zoom tool using the keyboard, select any other tool in the 
Toolbox and move the pointer into the Document window.
10 Now hold down Control+spacebar (Windows) or Command+spacebar (Mac OS) 
to use the Zoom tool. Click or drag to zoom in on any area of the artwork, and 
then release the keys.
11 To zoom out using the keyboard, hold down Control+Alt+spacebar (Windows) 
or Command+Option+spacebar (Mac OS). Click the desired area to reduce the 
view of the page, and then release the keys.
12 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
scrolling through a document
In Muse, much like other Adobe applications, you can use the Hand tool to pan 
to different areas of a document. Using the Hand tool allows you to push the page 
around much like you would a piece of paper on your desk.
1 Select the Hand tool (
) in the Toolbox.
2 Drag down in the Document window. As you drag, the page moves with 
the hand.
P Note: In certain 
versions of Mac OS, the 
keyboard shortcuts for 
the Zoom tool open 
Spotlight in the Finder. 
If you decide to use 
these shortcuts in Muse, 
you may want to turn 
off or change those 
keyboard shortcuts 
in the Mac OS System 
Preferences.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 27
3 Click any other tool except the Text tool (
) in the Toolbox and move the 
pointer into the Document window.
4 Hold down the spacebar to select the Hand tool from the keyboard, and then 
drag up to bring the page back into the center of your view.
As with the Zoom tool (
), you can select the Hand tool with a keyboard 
shortcut without first deselecting the active tool.
P Note: The spacebar shortcut for the Hand tool does not work when the Text tool is active and 
your cursor is in text. To access the Hand tool while the Text tool is selected, press Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS).
Preview mode
As you create your designs in Muse, you can use Preview mode to see what your 
page will look like in a browser (without guides), test your links, view video and 
widget content, and more. As you will learn in later lessons, you can also preview 
a page or your entire site in a browser on your hard drive.
Why do we preview our websites?
Unlike the print world, where you output to a single printing device, on the Web 
there are many different browsers, and multiple versions of each browser—not to 
mention different platforms like Mac OS and Windows. Typically, you’ll want to test 
your websites in all of these different environments.
You can preview your site in Muse by clicking the Preview link in the upper-left 
corner of the Application window. Preview uses WebKit as a rendering engine—the 
same engine that powers the Apple Safari browser and a host of other applications 
such as Google Chrome and Adobe AIR.
The code that Muse generates is automatically cross-browser compatible. This lets 
you focus on your design and use Preview as a way to test your links and other 
content by browsing through it the way site visitors would.
As of the writing of this book, the Muse team tests and optimizes output for the 
following browsers:
• 
Firefox 11 for Mac OS and Windows
• 
Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9 for Windows
• 
Safari 5 for Mac
• 
Chrome for Mac OS and Windows

lesson 1 
overview of the Workspace
1 With the HOME page showing in Design mode, click the Preview link in the 
upper-left corner of the Application window.
Notice that any animations, such as .SWF content, links, slideshows, videos, and 
others are fully active in the preview.
E Tip: You can also preview a page by pressing Ctrl+P (Windows) or Command+P (Mac OS).
2 Click the KART MAP link in the navbar at the top of the page. Notice that 
the KART MAP page appears. Preview lets you test links between pages and 
navigate the site as you would in a browser.
P Note: You cannot make edits to your pages while previewing them. You must return to Design 
mode to continue editing.
3 Click the Design mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window 
to return to Design mode.
No matter which page is showing in Preview, when you return to Design mode, 
the same pages that were open remain open.
4 Choose File > Close Site to close the .muse site file and any open pages 
associated with that site without saving changes.
P Note: If you did 
not properly install the 
lesson fonts, you may 
see a warning dialog 
box indicating missing 
fonts. Make sure that 
you see the “Fonts used 
in this book” section of 
“Getting Started” on 
page 2.
P Note: The text you 
see may be different 
in Preview mode, and 
that’s okay. That text is a 
live Twitter feed.
P Note: When Design 
mode is active, clicking 
the Preview link in the 
upper-left corner of the 
Application window 
previews the active 
page in the Document 
window. If you do not 
have a page open, Muse 
previews the first page 
of the site.

lesson 2 
Creating Your site
Creating a new site
In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of creating a Muse site, adding and 
organizing pages in Plan mode, and adding metadata to your pages.
P Note: To see the final site that you will create in these lessons, open the KoffeeKart_end_win.muse 
(Windows) or KoffeeKart_end_mac.muse (Mac OS) site file in the Lessons folder.
When you begin to work in Muse, you first create a site file with the extension 
.muse. That site file contains all of the pages, master pages, colors, styles, and more 
that you will use in your website. Muse provides an environment where you can 
easily plan, design, and organize all of your web documents.
You need to create a Muse site before you can begin creating pages that belong to 
that site, and that’s what you’ll do first.
1 Launch Adobe Muse. When the Welcome screen appears, click Site in the 
Create New section. Alternately, you can close the Welcome screen and choose 
File > New Site.
The New Site dialog box appears. Here you will set page dimensions, margins, 
columns, and other page properties that you can edit later if necessary.
2 In the New Site dialog box, set the following options:
• Page Width: 960
• Min Height: 800
• Center Horizontally: Selected 
(default setting)
• Make All Margin Settings The 
Same: Deselected (
)
• Top and Bottom Margins: 52
• Left Margin: 57
• Right Margin: 53
• Top and Bottom Padding: 36
Set these last:
• Columns: 3
• Column Width: 270 (default setting)
• Gutter: 20 (default setting)
Notice that you cannot edit the Left padding value (it is dimmed). That is 
because the page is set to center horizontally in the browser window.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 2.
P Note: Going 
forward, the units you 
will use in Muse will 
be in pixels, unless 
otherwise indicated.
E Tip: To learn more 
about the New Site 
dialog box settings, see 
the “Site_settings.pdf” 
file in the Lesson02 
folder.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 33
3 Click OK.
Muse opens the new site you created in Plan mode.
4 Choose File > Save Site As. In 
the Save Adobe Muse File As 
dialog box, navigate to and 
open the Lessons folder. Type 
KevinsKoffeeKart.muse in 
the Save As text field, and 
click Save. 
Edit the site properties
You don’t always get it right the first time, and you easily can edit the options you 
originally set for your site as well as add some new ones at any point later on.
1 With the KevinsKoffeeKart.muse site file still open, choose File > Site Properties.
The Site Properties dialog box opens, displaying the layout settings you specified 
when you created the site. You can change their values at any time from this 
dialog, as well as specify other optional properties by clicking the Hyperlinks 
button (more on that in step 4) or the Favicon Image setting. A favicon is a 
small image in the .ico format that displays to the left of your site’s address 
in a browser’s Address bar and the site’s name in history and bookmark lists. 
Although it doesn’t affect your site’s functioning, a favicon image can give 
visitors a visual cue that it is your site.
2 Click the folder icon to the right 
of Favicon Image in the Site 
Properties dialog box to browse 
for an image to use as your site 
favicon. As you consider potential 
images, keep in mind that favicons 
must be square. 
P Note: Muse allows 
you to save as only one 
file type (.muse) as of 
the writing of this book.
E Tip: If you want to 
make your own favicon 
in a program like Adobe 
Illustrator or Adobe 
Photoshop, make a 
new document that is 
32 pixels by 32 pixels 
with a resolution of 
72 ppi (pixels per inch). 
Add your content, and 
save it as a .jpg, .gif, or 
.png file.

lesson 2 
Creating Your site
3 Navigate to the images folder in  
the Lessons folder, choose 
favicon.png, and click Select.
A small, red coffee cup icon 
appears to the right of the Favicon 
Image to indicate the new setting. 
When the site is published, Muse 
converts the image to the .ico 
format that most browsers use as 
the favicon image type.
4 Click the Hyperlinks option at  
the top of the Site Properties 
dialog box.
When you create text links to 
other pages, sites, and so on, Muse 
allows you to create multiple 
styles for the various states of 
those links. You can set and adjust 
the colors and other formatting 
options for those styles here. You 
will create hyperlink styles in 
Lesson 7, “Working with Links and Buttons.”
5 Click OK to close the Site Properties dialog box.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
7 Choose File > Preview Page In Browser to open the page in the default browser 
installed on your machine, such as Internet Explorer (Windows) or Safari 
(Mac OS). Notice the favicon that appears next to the Address bar in the 
browser.
8 Close the browser and return to Muse.
Now you will begin to explore Plan mode and the site map by adding and organiz-
ing pages in your site.
P Note: If you want 
to remove the favicon, 
you can click the Delete 
Current Favicon button.
P Note: To see the 
favicon in the address 
bar of a web browser, 
you must preview the 
page in a browser on 
your machine, rather 
than preview the page 
by clicking the Preview 
link above the Control 
panel in Muse.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 35
Creating and editing your site map
The best way to begin working on your site is by editing your site map. Refining a 
site map is a critical first step because the map shows the number of pages in your 
site, how the pages will be ordered, and how they connect to each other in the site 
navigation. In the exercises that follow, you will edit your site map in Plan mode.
With the KevinsKoffeeKart.muse site file open, make sure Plan mode is selected 
in the upper-left corner of the Application window. As you can see, Plan mode is 
divided into two main sections: the site plan area and the masters area. The site 
plan area contains thumbnail images of your website’s pages organized into a site 
map that shows how those pages relate to each other. Below each page thumbnail 
are the page’s name and, in blue brackets, the name of the master page associated 
with that page. The masters section, below the site plan area, contains the default 
master page that every Muse site starts with. A master page is essentially a template 
that you use to maintain consistency across the pages in your website. You will learn 
more about master pages in Lesson 3, “Working with Master Pages.”
Site plan   
(contains the   
site map)
Masters
When you create a new site, Muse creates one blank home page and one blank 
master page by default. These pages are the starting point for your site map and 
website itself. The next step is to begin adding pages to your site and determine 
how users will navigate your site.
E Tip: Muse gives 
you lots of flexibility 
when creating your 
website. You can add 
blank pages to your site 
map and then apply 
masters to them later, 
or you can create your 
website by starting with 
the master, applying 
it to a single page (the 
Home page), and then 
creating new pages 
based on that.

36 
lesson 2 
Creating Your site
adding and deleting pages in your site
In a Muse site, the web pages you create in your site map follow a basic family 
hierarchy and are displayed in levels that reinforce their relationships. Sibling pages 
appear on the same level in the site plan. Child pages appear a level below and are 
usually linked from a particular Parent page. Parent and sibling pages may appear 
on the Home-page level or another level of the site map, while child pages reside 
below the Home-page level. Any page on any level of the site plan can have sibling 
pages or child pages.
Child 
pages
Parent page
Top Level 
pages
Sibling pages
The site map’s top level includes the pages that will make up the site’s main naviga-
tion. For example, the page named Home is always a top-level page. Any pages that 
you create to the right or left of the Home page are considered siblings to Home 
and are also in the top level of the site navigation. The next figure illustrates how a 
Muse site map later translates into a navigation menu for the site.

in Plan mode

based on the site map
P Note: For more 
information on sibling 
and child pages, see the 
“Set up the Site Map” 
section in Lesson 1 on 
page 11.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 37
adding sibling pages
You’ll learn more about the relationship between the site map and menus in 
Lesson 3, “Working with Master Pages.” For now simply concentrate on adding top-
level pages to your site.
1 Position the cursor over the Home page thumbnail in the site plan area.
Notice a series of plus signs (+) appear on the right, bottom, and left sides of the 
thumbnail. Clicking the plus sign to the right or left of a page thumbnail adds a 
sibling page. Clicking the plus sign beneath the page thumbnail adds a child page.
2 Click the plus sign (+) to 
the right of the Home page 
thumbnail to add a new 
sibling page to the right of the 
Home page.
After inserting a page, you 
can immediately change the 
title of the page.
3 Select the text “Untitled 2” 
beneath the new thumbnail 
to rename the page, and type 
THE KOFFEE in all capital letters.
When the site is published, by default Muse uses the name that appears beneath 
each site map thumbnail as the page’s title at the top of the browser window. 
Muse also automatically fills these names into the navigation menu you create 
to access the pages. You’ll learn more about menus in Lesson 3, “Working with 
Master Pages.”
4 Choose File > Preview Page In Browser to open the home page in the default 
browser installed on your machine.
Notice that Muse used the thumbnail’s name, Home, as the title of the page at 
the top of the browser window. You’ll learn how to specify more descriptive 
titles for pages in “Adding page metadata” on page 42.
5 Close the browser window, and return to Muse.
6 Position the cursor over the thumbnail labeled THE KOFFEE, then click 
the plus sign (+) to its right to add a new sibling page to the right of the 
THE KOFFEE page.
E Tip: You can also 
choose Page > Add 
New Top Level Page 
to add a new page to 
the top level of the site 
map. Don’t forget, a 
top-level page is any 
page that appears to 
the right or left of the 
Home thumbnail in the 
site map.
P Note: If you cannot 
select the text “Untitled 
2” beneath the page 
thumbnail, try slowly 
clicking the text twice. 
You can also right-click 
(Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS) the page 
thumbnail and choose 
Rename Page from the 
resulting context menu 
to select the text.

38 
lesson 2 
Creating Your site
7 Change the name of  
the page to ABOUT 
using the technique 
from step 3.
8 Position the cursor 
over the THE 
KOFFEE thumbnail, 
then click the plus 
sign (+) to the right 
four more times. You now have a total of seven pages, including the Home, THE 
KOFFEE, and ABOUT pages.
9 Beneath each of the new page thumbnails, click twice slowly to edit the title of 
each page. Starting from the left, name them KART MAP, PRODUCTS, OUR 
STORY, and GALLERY, respectively.
The page thumbnails may not fit in the visible site plan area. If they don’t, a 
horizontal scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the site plan area, above the 
masters area.
10 In the upper-left corner of the Application window, drag the Size slider to the 
left to resize the page thumbnails until they all fit horizontally in the site plan 
area and the scroll bar disappears.
adding child pages
With top-level pages created, you turn them into parent pages by adding child 
pages to your site map, if necessary. Child pages are typically lower-level pages that 
are accessible on a web page via a pop-up menu that appears when you position 
the pointer over the top-level navigation. You can add child pages to help further 
organize the pages in your site.
Once published, the KevinsKoffeeKart site will showcase several products. 
Each product will have its own page, all of which will be child pages to the 
PRODUCTS page.
1 Position the pointer over the PRODUCTS page thumbnail, and click the plus 
sign (+) that appears beneath it.
2 Select the default name of the new child page, and type Grinders.
E Tip: Another way 
to add another sibling 
page is to right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl-
click (Mac OS) a page 
thumbnail and choose 
New Sibling Page from 
the context menu. This 
command adds a new 
sibling page to the 
right of the active page 
thumbnail.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 39
Notice that a line now connects the PRODUCTS (parent) and Grinders (child) 
pages, indicating their relationship.
3 Position the pointer over the Grinders page thumbnail, and then click the plus 
sign (+) to the right two more times to add two sibling pages to the right of the 
Grinders page.
4 Slowly double-click the text “Untitled 10” to select it (if not already selected) 
and enter Coffee for the page’s new name. Your page name may be different 
from “Untitled 10.” Just make sure it’s the middle child page beneath the 
PRODUCTS page.
Notice that the three new pages—Grinders, Coffee, and Untitled 9—are 
now sibling pages of each other and are also child pages of the parent page 
PRODUCTS. (If the addition of the child pages made the page thumbnails 
spread out too much to be seen, drag the Size slider to the left until all the page 
thumbnails fit in the visible the site plan area.)
5 Position the pointer over the Untitled 9 page thumbnail (the third page from the 
left in the child pages). Notice the delete button (x) that appears off the upper-
right corner of the thumbnail. Just as you can add pages to your site map with a 
click, you can delete them as easily.
6 Click the delete button to remove the page from the site map.
As you add and delete pages to create your site map, know that you don’t have to 
have the site map finalized before you begin adding content to existing pages. You 
can always add, delete, and rearrange pages later.
E Tip: Another way to 
add a child page is to 
right-click (Windows) 
or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) 
a page thumbnail and 
choose New Child 
Page from the context 
menu. This command 
adds a new child page 
beneath the active 
page thumbnail.
E Tip: Another way 
to delete a page is to 
right-click (Windows) 
or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) 
a page thumbnail and 
choose Delete Page 
from the context menu.
P Note: When you 
delete a parent page, 
such as PRODUCTS, 
Muse does not delete 
the children of the 
page, but instead raises 
them to the level of the 
former parent page.

40 
lesson 2 
Creating Your site
arranging pages in the site map
A well-organized site map will help you immensely when you begin to insert a menu 
system into your pages. Rearranging the pages in your site map in Plan mode is easy.
1 Drag the Size slider to the left until all the page thumbnails fit in the visible the 
site plan area, if necessary.
2 Click and drag the ABOUT page thumbnail to the right of the KART MAP 
page. When you see a blue drop zone between the pages, release the mouse.
The ABOUT page thumbnail now resides to the right of the KART MAP page 
thumbnail in the site map. As you drag pages in the site map, you can also easily 
drag and duplicate them.
3 Press and hold the Alt (Window) or Option (Mac OS) key and drag the ABOUT 
page thumbnail to the right until you see a blue drop zone between the pages. 
Release the mouse button and then the key. You just created a page copy.
4 Position the pointer over the ABOUT copy page thumbnail and click the delete 
button to remove the page from the site map.
5 Click and drag the Coffee child page thumbnail to the left until it is directly on 
top of the Grinders page thumbnail. When a blue drop zone appears beneath 
the Grinders thumbnail, release the mouse button.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 41
Rearranging child pages is as simple as dragging: The Coffee page is now a child 
of the Grinders page.
6 Choose Edit > Undo Rearrange Page to put the child pages back in the previous 
order.
7 Drag the Coffee page thumbnail to the left of the Grinders page thumbnail, 
directly over the plus sign (+). When you see the small blue drop zone to the left 
of Grinders, release the mouse button to relocate Coffee.
8 Position the pointer over the PRODUCTS page thumbnail, then drag it between 
the KART MAP and ABOUT pages. When the blue drop zone appears between 
the thumbnails, release the mouse button.
Notice the Coffee and Grinders pages moved as well. Relocating a parent page 
moves all of its child pages at the same time.
9 Choose File > Save Site.
setting page properties
When you created your site and edited the site properties, you set default proper-
ties for every page in your site. In addition to editing those properties for the entire 
site, you can also edit them on a page-by-page basis, which is what you’ll do in this 
exercise.
P Note: Instead of 
choosing to undo the 
previous operation, 
you could have instead 
dragged the Coffee 
thumbnail back to the 
right of the Grinders 
thumbnail and released 
the mouse button when 
the blue drop zone 
appeared.

42 
lesson 2 
Creating Your site
1 In Plan mode, position the pointer over the Home page thumbnail and double-
click to open that page in Design mode.
2 Choose Page > Page Properties.
In the Page Properties dialog box that opens, you will see the same familiar 
options. This time, however, any changes you make will affect the Home page 
only. Any options you change also will override the default properties set when 
you first created the site or edited later by choosing File > Site Properties.
3 Change the columns to 1. The column guides disappear; only the margin guides 
around the inside edge of the page edge remain. Leave the dialog box open for 
the next section.
E Tip: To learn more about using the columns and guides to your advantage when designing, see 
the “Grid_design.pdf” file in the Lesson02 folder.
adding page metadata
In addition to setting standard page properties in the Page Properties dialog box, 
you can also add metadata to each of your pages. Consisting of key information 
about your site, metadata is a great way for you to provide search engines, such as 
Google and Bing, with a summary of your page.
Adding metadata is also a first step on the long road of search engine optimization, 
(SEO), the process of trying to improve the visibility of a website in search engines 
in unpaid search results. The goal is to get ranked higher by search engines, mean-
ing search engines perceive your site as more relevant to the search terms someone 
enters and place it higher in their returned lists of results.
E Tip: Another way 
to access the page 
properties without 
opening the page in 
Design mode is to 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
the Home thumbnail in 
Plan mode and choose 
Page Properties from 
the context menu.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 43
In Muse, you can add three types of metadata to describe the page content to a 
search engine:
• The title appears at the top of the browser window when you preview a page or 
visit it on the Web. For instance, when you visit adobe.com, you can see the title 
of the page at the top of the browser window.
By default, Muse uses a page’s name (the name you edited under the page’s 
thumbnail in Plan mode) as its title. As you’ll see in the following exercise, you 
can use Page Properties to change the title to a more descriptive phrase. Your title 
provides visitors and search engines with useful information about your site.
• The description briefly describes the page content or provides information 
about a blog post such as author and date or byline information. In some cases, 
search engines show a portion of this description in their results. If you search 
for Adobe at google.com, for instance, in the search results you would see the 
site title and a description below that. Some search engines also display the 
description metadata that you add to each page.
It’s a good idea to write descriptions that accurately reflect the specific content 
on a given page. A description can be as long as you wish, but most sites keep it 
within 150 characters to avoid being cut off in search engine results.
• Keywords are words and phrases that relate directly to the content on your 
site and that someone is likely to type in when searching for your business or 
website in a search engine.

44 
lesson 2 
Creating Your site
Adding metadata to your pages doesn’t guarantee that your site will be ranked 
higher by a search engine, but using a relevant title, description, and keywords in 
your pages typically doesn’t hurt and is considered the best practice. In addition, 
search engines display some of this metadata information to users in their search 
results, which might draw in some extra visitors.
1 Click the Metadata option at the top of the Page Properties dialog box to view 
the metadata options.
2 In the Description field, type Kevin’s Koffee Kart is the best San Francisco 
coffee vendor specializing in great local gourmet coffee, coffee roasting, and 
bagged coffee.
3 In the Keywords field below, enter coffee, San Francisco, roasting, and
gourmet. Be sure to list keywords in priority, from most to least important,  
and to separate each keyword or key phrase with a comma. Choose keywords  
that are relevant to the specific page you’re working on.
Skip over the HTML for <head> field. It is used to add code to a section of 
the HTML page that is generated when you preview, publish, or export a site. 
Continue to the next field, Page Name. Muse automatically fills in the name you 
gave the page in Plan mode. You can change the name, but remember that Muse 
will use this name in the menu bar you’ll create later. For this site, you want 
Home to appear in the menu bar, so don’t change the page name setting.
4 Under the Page Title field, deselect Same As Page Name.
By default, Muse sets the Page Title field to be the same as the Page Name field. 
Deselecting Same as Page Name enables you to enter a unique, more descriptive 
title in the Page Title field.
P Note: Some 
search engines give 
certain metadata less 
importance when 
ranking a page in 
search results. Google, 
for instance, currently 
doesn’t add weight to 
metadata keywords in 
its page rankings but 
does suggest that you 
add a good title and 
relevant description to 
your pages.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 45
5 In Page Title, type KevinsKoffeeKart, a San Francisco gourmet coffee cart | 
Home.
Remember, the title of a page displays at the top of the browser window and 
can appear in the search results for search engines. By specifying a relevant title 
and adding the text “| Home” to the end, you give the search engine information 
about the page and indicate to visitors which page they are on.
P Note: Below the Page Title field in the Page Properties dialog box is the Filename field. The name 
of the HTML file that Muse generates when you publish the site will be the same as the page name. 
For a page named PRODUCTS in the site map, for example, Muse names the HTML file products.
html. The exception to this rule is the Home page. Conventionally, the first page of a website, which 
is usually the Home page, has a filename of index.html. You cannot edit the file name for the home 
page, so this option is dimmed. Editing the filename is necessary only under special circumstances, 
such as when the web developer you’re working with asks you to do so.
Writing good descriptions  
and page titles
Because the metadata descriptions aren’t displayed in the pages visitors see, you 
might be tempted to let this content slide. Resist the urge, however. Because 
high-quality descriptions are more likely to be displayed in Google search results, 
taking the time to write this content can go a long way to improving the quality and 
quantity of your search traffic.
To make your page titles and descriptions for effective, remember to
• 
Write unique, specific descriptions for each page of your site.
• 
Include facts about the content on the page that are not represented in the title.
• 
Make the descriptions easy to read.
• 
Make sure your descriptions represent the content on the page.

Creating Your site
6 Click OK.
7 Choose File > Preview Page In Browser to see that the title at the top of the 
browser window now reads “KevinsKoffeeKart, a San Francisco gourmet coffee 
cart | Home.”
8 Close the browser and return to Muse.
9 Choose File > Close Page to close the page named Home and return to Plan 
mode. Alternatively, you can click the X in the Home tab to close the Home page 
and return to Plan mode.
10 Choose File > Save Site, leaving the KevinsKoffeeKart.muse site file open for the 
next lesson.
As you progress through the lessons, you can add title, description, and keywords 
to each of the pages if you like.
In the next lesson, you will learn about working with master pages, which make it 
easier and faster to apply consistent content and formatting to multiple pages.
E Tip: After setting 
the page properties, 
you might later realize 
that you don’t want 
those properties (like 
metadata or columns) 
to be different from 
other pages in your site. 
You can always reset 
the page properties 
to the default site 
properties by choosing 
Page > Reset Page 
Properties.

4 What is the purpose of a site map?
5 What is a top-level page?
6 What are three types of metadata that can be added in the page properties?
review answers
1 Min height is the minimum height that a page will be in the browser. As you add 
content to a page, the page height will increase to fit the new content.
2 The favicon is an image that appears in a browser’s Address bar next to your site’s 
address. It is square and typically 32 pixels x 32 pixels or 16 x 16 pixels in dimension. 
You can set the favicon for the entire site in the Site Properties dialog box (File > Site 
Properties). Muse lets you use a .jpg, .gif, or .png image as the favicon.
3 The two parts of Plan mode are the site plan area and masters area.
4 The site map in Plan mode is a critical first step in the website creation process because 
it shows the number of pages in your site, how the pages will be ordered, and how they 
relate to each other in the site navigation.
5 A top-level page is a page that appears in Plan mode at the top level of the site map. 
These pages are the main sections of the site and automatically appear in the site’s 
menu bar. In the case of the Kevin’s Koffee Kart site, the top-level pages are, Home, 
THE KOFFEE, KART MAP, PRODUCTS, ABOUT, OUR STORY, and GALLERY.
6 Three types of metadata that Muse allows you to insert into your pages in the Page 
Properties dialog box (Page > Page Properties) are a title, a description, and keywords. 
The page name and filename can also be used by search engines to help improve the 
ranking of your page and can be considered metadata as well.

Working with master pages in Muse allows you to 
control the appearance of pages, set up consistent 
areas of your pages, such as headers and footers, 
and maintain design consistency across the pages in 
your website.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
Web design versus print design
As you begin to design your pages in Muse, you’ll discover quickly that web design 
relies on many familiar print design concepts regarding text, graphics, color, and 
more. Soon after that, you’ll also realize that web design offers its own set of chal-
lenges and design parameters that aren’t so familiar. To help you navigate them, this 
section explores some of the biggest differences between print and the Web.
resolution
Resolution refers to the number of pixels that fit in 1 linear inch and is expressed as 
PPI, or pixels per inch. In print, the optimal resolution is 300ppi for images, whereas 
on the Web, the standard image resolution is 72ppi. Unlike in the print world, on the 
Web you must also be concerned with how resolution affects your finished page’s 
file size. Keeping most web image files at this lower resolution increases download 
speed, which is important for site performance.
300ppi
72ppi
fixed, yet fluid design
For a print design job, one of the first pieces of information you get is the physical 
dimensions of the final piece.
When you’re designing for the Web, however, the dimensions of your site are less 
cut-and-dried. In fact, you’re ideally building a site that works within a range of 
monitor and device screen resolutions. As a result, you have to consider how your 
web pages will look when viewed in a variety of different resolutions. Most websites 
have vertical scrolling content, meaning the height of the page is dictated by its 
content (as opposed to horizontally scrolling content).
As for width, at the time of this writing, Muse creates what are commonly called 
fixed width pages. That means that your pages are a set width and are centered in 
the browser window. To avoid horizontal scrolling, design your web page in Muse to 
fit the width of the smallest monitor resolution, which is typically 1024 × 768 pixels.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 51
Although you can set certain content to be 100% of the width of the browser win-
dow, you cannot yet do that for an entire page. In the future, you may be able to 
design your pages in Muse to fit variable monitor resolutions, in order to accom-
modate smaller devices like tablets and smartphones.
file size
When you design for print, file sizes can balloon quickly, but as long as you can fit 
your files on a disc, upload them via FTP, or push them through the RIP, large file 
sizes aren’t an obstacle. When you design for the Web, however, file size is impor-
tant enough to steer your design decisions. No one likes to wait and wait while a 
site loads large bulky files, and remember, all the images on your site have to down-
load to a visitor’s machine before they can be viewed. Download times can, and 
will, impact how your website performs. For instance, suppose a site visitor opens 
a really simple web page, which contains only text and three images. The visitor’s 
browser will have to make a series of connections to the server that hosts your 
page: one to locate the page itself and the three additional connections to retrieve 
each of the images on the page. That time adds up quickly. To keep your site as lean 
and quick to download as possible, reuse images on a web page when you can. Even 
if your logo appears ten times on the page, for example, a visitor’s browser has to 
download it only once.
understand web navigation
Site navigation determines how visitors get  
around, or navigate, the pages of your site and is 
a vital consideration. If visitors find your site 
difficult to navigate, they will quickly leave and 
not return. As a result, early in the planning 
process make designing effective navigation for 

52 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
your site a priority. As you will see, your site navigation is tied directly to the design 
of your pages.
When you’re planning your site navigation, consider
• Consistency is key. Changing the colors or location of your navigation system 
between pages can quickly frustrate site visitors. For example, if menu items 
are blue on the home page but the same menu items are green on different 
site pages, your visitors will likely get annoyed or lost and leave your site in 
frustration. Determine a single style and placement for your site navigation, and 
keep it consistent throughout your pages.
• Clearly label your navigation elements. Simple images or icons aren’t always 
enough to guide site visitors. In fact, visitors might not even recognize some 
icons as navigational elements. Use clear section labels so your site visitors can 
quickly and easily navigate to different parts of your site.
Design with interactivity in mind
When you design a web page, you consider how users 
will interact with the content. When designing a button, 
for example, you need to also consider the states of that 
button—how it appears initially, when hovered over, and 
when clicked. Typically, when you hover over a button, its 
appearance changes to indicate that the button is con-
nected to an action, like taking you to another page, and 
when you click it changes again, to indicate an action will occur when you release 
the button. You need to design the button states as well. You will learn more about 
button states in Lesson 7, “Working with Links and Buttons.”
Building a master page
When you create a site in Muse, you start 
with a single master page, which is essen-
tially a template you can apply to other 
pages. Using a single master page, or even 
using a few master pages to target differ-
ent site sections, makes it easier to create 
consistent pages and a cohesive site. For 
example, if you add content to the master 
page such as a logo and a navigation menu, 
any page you apply the master to will con-
tain those elements in the same positions. 
When you change a master page, all pages 
based on that master reflect those changes.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons folder 
onto your hard disk, 
from the Adobe Muse 
Classroom in a Book
disc. See “Copying the 
Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 53
In Plan mode, the masters section, located below the site plan area, contains the 
default master page that every Muse site starts with. A master page is essentially a 
design that contains all of the common site elements that you use to maintain con-
sistency across the pages in your website. In this next section, you will learn how to 
create, delete, apply, and add content to a master page in your site.
editing the page area and browser fill
When you design for the Web, you must consider not only the page design and 
contents, but also the area outside of the page area, called the browser fill in Muse. 
The browser fill is the area that surrounds your page when a visitor’s browser 
window’s width exceeds the width you specified for your page. Remember, Muse 
uses fixed layouts, so if a visitor resizes the browser window, your page won’t 
widen to fill it. You will need to specify something, such as a background color or 
image to fill the space.
When you open a page or master page, Muse divides the Document window into a 
white page area and two gray areas outside of that white box. The white box is the 
page area, which contains the content for your page. The dark gray area outside the 
page area is the browser fill area. It can contain a color, an image, or both, which 
appear behind the page area’s contents. The lighter gray zone outside of the browser 
fill area is beyond the edge of the browser and cannot be edited.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
1 With your KevinsKoffeeKart site open in  
Plan mode, look at the page thumbnails in 
the site map. Below each thumbnail you see 
[A-Master] in blue, which indicates that the 
A-Master master page is applied to the 
thumbnail’s page. As a result, any elements 
on A-Master appear on the related page.
2 Double-click the A-Master thumbnail in the 
masters area at the bottom of the Application 
window to open the A-Master page.
The A-Master page opens as a new tab in the Document window in Design mode. 
As you saw in the first chapter, with a page or master page open the workspace 
shows a lot more features, including the Control panel, Toolbox, and panels.
3 Choose View > Fit Page In Window, then Choose View > Zoom Out.
The first step in creating your page design is adding content to the master page. 
In most cases, you will add header content, such as a logo and menu bar, and 
footer content, such as social media links and more, to the master page, because 
those elements should appear on every page.
In the Control panel, notice that the Selection Indicator on the left end of the 
panel shows Page. As you learned in Lesson 1, this indicates that nothing is 
selected on the page and that any formatting options you change in the Control 
panel will affect the page area.
The Browser Fill menu in the Control panel is the exception to this rule. The 
Browser Fill menu allows you to add a color and image to the background of the 
browser window, which resides behind the page area.
4 Click the Color box to the right of the Browser Fill menu in the Control panel. 
Click the white color in the panel that appears.
Notice that the color behind the page area changes to white. That white color 
will now fill the browser window, regardless of screen size (screen resolution).
P Note: You will learn 
more about creating 
and saving colors in 
Lesson 5, “Working with 
Shapes and Color.”

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 55
5 Click Browser Fill in the Control panel to see the fill options for the browser.
The preview area at the top of the options previews the color and/or image you 
set within the browser area. Here you can change the color, as well as add or 
adjust a background image.
6 Click the folder to the right of the Image option. Navigate to the Lessons folder 
and in the images folder, select the image bk-map.gif. Click Open (Windows) or 
Select (Mac OS).
This step inserts an image, bk-map.gif, into the background of the browser 
window, where it appears behind the page area. You will typically create the 
background image in a separate application, such as Adobe Photoshop or 
Adobe Illustrator, and save it in an accepted web format (.jpg, .gif, or .png). You 
will learn more about image types in Lesson 6, “Adding Images to Your Site.”
7 In the Browser Fill options, choose Original Size from the Fitting menu, and 
select the center point of the Position reference point indicator ( ).
Muse now inserts the image in the browser background at the same pixel 
dimensions as you created it and positions it in the center of the browser 
window, no matter the size of the browser window.
8 Deselect the Scrolling option.
With Scrolling deselected, the 
background image stays in place if the 
user scrolls the page content using the 
scroll bars in the browser. The page 
content scrolls on top of the fixed 
background image. If you’d rather have 
the image scroll with the page, leave 
Scrolling selected.
9 Choose View > Preview Mode to preview the background image. If scroll bars 
appear in the Application window, try scrolling the page to see the effect. If 
you don’t see scroll bars in the application, your screen resolution may be large 
enough to fit the entire page, and that’s okay.

56 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
Background image tips
If you are going to create your own background image, you should consider a 
few points:
• 
If you want a single background image to fill the browser window, make sure 
that you make it large enough to fill a larger screen resolution.
• 
Consider the file size of the background image. One larger image can be 
much larger and take longer to load into a browser compared to one small, 
repeating image.
• 
If you are going to create a background image that contains texture, use a low-
contrast, subtle texture or pattern.
• 
If an image is to repeat in the background, make sure that the edges line up 
perfectly. You can do this within the program you use to create the background 
image.
• 
For an image that you want to repeat, remove objects that stand out from the 
rest of the image, otherwise your image will not blend into a unified texture 
when repeated.
setting the page area’s appearance
Next, you will edit the appearance of the page area. As you did for the browser fill 
area, you can assign a background color and image for the page area along with 
other options to match your design. In addition, you can adjust the opacity of the 
page area to allow the browser fill, a busy map, to be visible behind it. To ensure that 
there is a high level of contrast between the page content and the background con-
tent, you can adjust the opacity, color, and other formatting options of the page area. 
By default, the page area has a white color fill and a black, 1-pixel stroke (border).
1 Click the Design mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window 
to return to Design mode.
2 With Page showing in the Selection Indicator, click the word “Fill” in the 
Control panel to show the Fill options.
Notice the choices for Fill Type, Solid and Gradient, are dimmed. The page 
area can’t have a gradient, only a solid color, which is why you can’t change 
this setting.
3 In the Fill options, click the arrow to the right of the Opacity option and drag 
the slider to the left until 94 appears in the field. (You could also simply enter 
the value.) This makes the page area very slightly transparent.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 57
If you want to change the color fill of the page area, you can do so in the Fill 
options as well.
The Fill options also include an option for a background image for the page 
area. The options are similar to the options for the browser fill, only the image 
would appear in the page area, on top of the page fill color.
4 Click away from the Fill options in the page area to hide the options.
5 Click the down arrow to the right of the Stroke Color so that the stroke is 0 
(zero). That removes the default black stroke around the edge of the page area, 
indicated by the arrow in the figure.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
Now that the page area is set, you can start to edit other properties for the 
master page.
editing master page properties
In the previous lesson, you set up the site file and edited the page properties. Just as 
you can for a single page, you can also edit those same properties for a master page. 
The difference is that any page that has that master page applied will have the same 
properties as the master page by default. Setting page properties on a master page 

58 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
can save time because it lets you set properties across multiple pages simultane-
ously, instead of editing them page by page.
1 Choose Page > Page Properties with the A-Master page open in Design mode.
2 In the Page Properties dialog box, which should start to look familiar, change 
the Min Height value to 640. Click OK.
That setting decreases the minimum height of all the pages with A-Master applied 
to them. Of course, you can make changes to the properties of your master pages 
later, if needed.
editing the master page guides
Like other websites designed with HTML and CSS, individual pages in your Muse 
website can have varying heights based on the unique content on each page, but 
all can feature the same header and footer regions. These regions ensure that the 
header content, such as your logo, always remains in place at the top of the page 
and the footer content, such as copyright information, always displays directly 
below the page content, regardless of the height of a given page. By adjusting the 
blue page guides on a master page in Design mode, you can easily specify consis-
tent header and footer sizes across multiple pages.
Using the page guides on the master, you can control not only the size of the header 
and footer, but also set the padding on the top and bottom of the page (the distance 
between the browser window edge and the page edge), and the minimum height of 
the page (called the Min Height). Some of these are settings you already saw when 
you edited the page properties. The master page guides simply give you a visual way 
to edit those same properties.
E Tip: To edit the 
page properties for the 
A-Master page, you 
could also stay in Plan 
mode and right-click 
(Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS) the 
A-Master thumbnail 
and choose Page 
Properties to edit them.
P Note: Clicking Reset 
in the Page Properties 
dialog box or choosing 
Page > Reset Page 
Properties will set 
the page properties 
to mirror the site 
properties and remove 
any page/browser fill 
changes you made.

Here’s a quick guide to page guides:
A Top of Page: Defines padding above the page and is the same as the Padding 
Top setting in the page properties.
B Header: Delineates the bottom of the header area. Items inserted on a master 
page above the header guide appear at the top of the page and are locked 
(cannot be selected or edited) on the pages of the site.
C Margin guides: Define a safe area of the page in which to lay out page content. 
Objects snap to the margin guides as you lay out your page. Margins, columns, 
and gutters in Muse are similar to margins and columns you use when designing 
layouts in Adobe InDesign.
D Column guides: Divide the page area into columns of content.
E Gutters: Specify the distance between columns.
F Page area: Indicates where you can add the unique content for each page.
G Footer: Delineates the top of the footer area. Items below the footer guide appear 
at the bottom of the page. Elements associated with the footer stay at the bottom 
of the page, regardless of content height, and elements placed in the footer on a 
master page are locked (cannot be selected or edited) on the pages of the site.
H Bottom of Page: Defines the minimum page height. This is the same as the Min 
Height setting in the page properties. You set the minimum height in an earlier 
step when you edited the master page properties. This guide is a visual way to 
edit that value.
I 
Bottom of Browser: Defines padding below the page and is the same as the 
Padding Bottom setting in the page properties.

60 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
The next exercise gives you some practice working with guides. You’ll add padding 
to the top of the A-Master page, which pushes the page area (the white box) down, 
then use this extra room to increase the header region enough to hold a larger logo 
and menu bar. Finally, you’ll adjust the three guides in the lower portion of the page.
1 With A-Master page open in Design mode, locate the Top of Page blue 
guide handle off the left side of the page. Drag the handle down, noticing the 
measurement label as you do so. When the Y: value is approximately 210px, 
release the mouse. The Y: value is a pixel value that indicates how far from the 
top edge of the browser the page area starts.
P Note: If you don’t see the master page guide handles, you may need to scroll over to the upper-
left part of the page using the Document window scroll bars, or choose View > Show Guides to 
display them again.
2 Off the left side of the page, click and drag the Header guide handle up until the 
Y: value shows 0 in the measurement label, then release the mouse.
The Y value, in this case, indicates how far from the top edge of the page area the 
header guide is located. Setting it to 0 puts the Top of Page guide and the Header 
guide on top of each other so that the header area is above the page area.
E Tip: If 210px is 
difficult to achieve 
by dragging, you can 
zoom into the page to 
see finer increments in 
the measurement label 
as you drag the page 
guides.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 61
the header and footer area  
in your design
The design for the KevinsKoffeeKart site called for header content that includes a 
logo and menu bar to be above the white page area. That’s why you dragged the 
Top of Page guide down: to leave a space for header content.
Some of your designs will require that the page area not have a gap between the 
top of the page and the browser window. You can accommodate this by setting the 
Top of Page guide at 0. You then drag the Header guide down into the page area 
and place the header content within the page area but above the Header guide. You 
could even choose Page > Page Properties and set the top margin to a large value 
that brings the Top of Page guide below the Header guide. This frames the position-
ing of the text and content on the page.
You can adjust the Footer and Bottom of Page guides to have similar relationships.
3 Click and drag the Footer guide down until the measurement label reads 
640px to overlap the Footer guide and the Bottom of Page guide. You may 
need to scroll down in the Document window.
4 Leave the Bottom of Page guide at the current location. Don’t forget, this sets 
the minimum height of the page.
P Note: Although you 
can edit the Header and 
Footer guides on master 
pages only, you can 
adjust all other page 
guides on individual 
pages in the site as well.

62 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
5 Drag the Bottom of Browser guide down until the measurement label shows a 
value of approximately 320px.
The Bottom of Browser guide gives you room to insert footer content below the 
page area and measures the distance from the bottom of the page.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
With the key areas of the master page mapped out, you can start adding content to 
them.
adding a logo to the header
The header of most websites contains a variety of content: a company logo, a menu 
bar (also called a navigation or nav bar), possibly social media links, and more. For 
now, you’ll concentrate on adding a logo to the KevinsKoffeeKart site’s header.
1 With A-Master still open in Design mode, choose View > Fit Page In Window, 
then scroll up using the scroll bars on the right side of the Document window to 
see the header area.
Fitting the A-Master page in the Document window fits only the white page 
area in the window. For this site, that cuts off the header and footer areas so you 
needed to scroll.
2 Choose File > Place. Navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder. Browse 
to the image called logo.png, and click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
Like InDesign, placing an image gives you the Place Gun ( ) in Muse. With the 
Place Gun, you click to place an image on the page at 100% its original size or 
click and drag to size the image as you place it.
P Note: The bottom 
of the browser window 
dictates the lowest 
part of the display area 
when a visitor views 
the site in a browser. 
If you want a strip of 
browser fill to appear 
below the lowest page 
content, set the Bottom 
of Page guide above 
the Bottom of Browser 
guide. If you do not 
want the browser fill to 
display below the page 
content, drag both the 
Bottom of Page guide 
and the Bottom of 
Browser guide to the 
same location.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 63
3 Position the Place Gun  
just below the top ruler in 
the Document window, 
and align it with the left 
edge of the page area. 
Remember, the image’s 
upper-left corner will sit 
where you click. See the 
figure for placement help. 
4 Click to place the logo. 
You will reposition the 
image later, so don’t worry 
if it doesn’t match the 
figure exactly.
When you place images, 
Muse, like InDesign, 
creates a frame and places 
the image within it. You 
can use the frame to crop 
the image, and you can 
move the image within 
the frame.
You will learn more about working with images in Lesson 6, “Adding Images 
to Your Site.”
5 Click the Plan link in the upper-left corner of the Application window to show 
Plan mode again.
Notice that each page thumbnail now shows the content you added to the 
A-Master page, including the background image and logo.

64 
Lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
6 Double-click the Home page thumbnail to open that page in Design mode.
7 With the Selection tool, try clicking on the company logo in the header.
You won’t be able to select or edit master content on your pages, and currently 
there is no way around that, as in InDesign.
8 Choose File > Close Page to return to the A-Master page.
With the A-Master page guides set and some of the header content in place, you 
will now add a menu bar to the header to help users navigate between the pages in 
your site.
Adding a navigation menu
When designing for the Web, the site navigation plays a key role in your design 
process, and the prime navigation system of any website is its menu bar.
To help you create one, Muse offers menu widgets. Although you can create a series 
of links to connect the pages manually, the widgets are a fast and flexible way to 
add navigation and more.
Widgets are ready-made objects that you can drag into your pages to add such func-
tionality as slideshow controls or a menu. Widgets live in the Widgets Library panel 
(Window > Widgets Library), which offers several categories of widgets to choose 
from. To add a widget, like a menu widget, simply drag it onto your page in Design 
mode. From there, you can customize it with your own content and formatting.
In this section, you will focus on the Menus category of the Widgets Library panel.
Exploring the different menus
Muse offers three menu widgets that you can use in your designs. Take a look at 
your choices:
1 In Design mode, click the Widgets Library panel tab to see the panel.
2 Double-click the Menus category in the Widgets Library panel to reveal those 
widgets.
E Tip: You can also click the arrow to the left of the category name to reveal the widgets in the 
category.
3 Click the Bar widget and notice that a preview  
appears in the top portion of the Widgets Library 
panel.
The Bar menu widget lists the menu items (links to 
your pages) horizontally. By default, it has a gradient 
fill in the background of each menu item and each 
menu item is the same width.
P Note: If you don’t 
see the A-Master page 
in the Document 
window, click the 
A-Master tab below the 
Control panel to show 
the page.
P Note: If the Widgets 
Library panel isn’t in

4 Click the Horizontal menu bar, then the Vertical menu bar listed in the 
Widgets Library panel and look at the previews for each. The Horizontal menu 
widget lists the menu items horizontally. By default, its menu items have no 
background color and the text they contain determines their widths.
The Vertical menu widget lists the menu items vertically. By default, items have 
a gradient fill in the background and are the same width and height.
The menu widgets are just a starting point, which means that you can change a 
widget’s appearance in almost any way you want after dragging it onto your page.
Inserting a menu widget
The next step, after deciding which menu bar you want to use on your 
page, is to drag it onto the page. The Horizontal widget works best for the 
KevinsKoffeeKart site.
1 Choose the Selection tool, if it’s not already selected, and make sure you can see 
the logo above the page area in the Document window. You are going to drag 
the menu widget to just below the logo.
2 From the Widgets Library panel, drag the Horizontal menu bar into the page 
area. Release the mouse when the pointer is positioned in the upper-left corner 
of the margin guides on the page. See the figure for help in placement, but don’t 
worry about exact placement. You’ll reposition the menu later in the lesson.
With the menu widget on the page, notice that Muse automatically filled in 
the names of your pages in the menu, following the same order as the page 
thumbnails in Plan mode. Muse creates the menu bar with links to all of the 
top-level pages in your site map. Be careful and accurate when naming those 
thumbnails; any errors in the site map names will appear in your menu!
Now that the menu is on the A-Master page, it shows up on all of the pages with 
A-Master applied.
3 Choose File > Save Site.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
excluding pages from the menu
Every time you create a new top-level page in Plan mode, Muse automatically adds 
it to the menu. Sometimes, however, you may want to test a page before opening it 
to visitors or hide a seasonally specific page during the offseason. From Plan mode 
you can specify pages to exclude from the navigation (to leave out of the menu bar).
1 Click the Plan mode link above the Control panel to return to Plan mode.
2 Position the pointer over the GALLERY thumbnail, and click the plus sign (+) to 
the right of the thumbnail to add another page.
3 Name the page GALLERYb.
This page will be another design option for the gallery page. Later, you can 
choose which of the two designs you prefer to use.
4 Drag the Size slider to the left so the page thumbnails are smaller and all fit in 
the plan area, if necessary.
5 Click the A-Master page tab above the site plan area to show the A-Master 
page in the Document window. Notice that the new page, GALLERYb, was 
automatically added to the menu.
In the menu, each page listed is called a menu item. Muse automatically creates 
links to those pages so you won’t have to do so later. The GALLERYb page is just 
for testing design ideas, however, so it doesn’t need to appear in the menu bar.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 67
6 Choose View > Plan Mode.
7 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the GALLERYb page 
thumbnail and choose Menu Options > Exclude Page From Menus so that the 
page no longer appears in the menu.
By default, any new pages are added to the menu, but by selecting Exclude Page 
From Menus for GALLERYb, only that single page is excluded from the menu.
8 Double-click the Home page name below the page thumbnail. Change the name 
to HOME.
If you discover a typo or otherwise need to adjust a page name for a consistent 
look in your menu, you can easily change it later in Plan mode. In this case, the 
Home page needed to become HOME to match the rest of the uppercase names 
in the menu.
9 Click the A-Master page tab below the Control panel to return to the master 
page and see the change in the menu bar.
10 Choose File > Save Site.

68 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
editing the menu widget parameters
After placing a menu widget onto a page, you can define how the menu behaves.
1 Choose Edit > Deselect All with the A-Master page showing in the Document 
window.
2 With the Selection tool, click to select the menu widget on the page.
Notice the blue circle with the white arrow appear in the upper-right corner of 
the menu. By clicking that arrow, you will reveal the Options menu.
3 Click the arrow to reveal Options menu, and set the following for the 
KevinsKoffeeKart site:
• Menu Type: All Pages
• Direction: Horizontal (the default setting)
• Edit Together: Selected (the default setting)
• Item Size: Uniform Width
• Show Left Icon: Deselected (the default setting)
• Show Label: Selected (the default setting)
• Show Right Icon: Off
• Parts Positioning: Horizontally; Center-Aligned (the default setting)
It is usually a good idea to set these basic options first, before you add your own 
styling to the menu bar.
P Note: To learn 
more about the menu 
options, see the  
“Menu_options.pdf” file 
in the Lesson03 folder.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 69
4 Click the Preview link above the Control panel. Move the pointer over the menu 
items, especially the PRODUCTS menu item in Preview to see the submenu.
5 Click the PRODUCTS link, and notice that the PRODUCTS menu item has a 
darker gray background color.
6 Click the Design mode link above the Control panel to return to the A-Master 
page in Design mode.
7 Choose File > Save Site to save the page and the site.
Include pages in the menu  
without a link
When creating a menu that has submenu content, like the PRODUCTS section of 
your menu, you may not want visitors to click the parent page (PRODUCTS). You 
may prefer that visitors are able to click only the child pages in the submenu. In Plan 
mode, you can include a page in the menu, but without a hyperlink to a page.
In Plan Mode, you can 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) a 
page thumbnail, like the 
PRODUCTS page thumb-
nail, and choose Menu 
Options > Include Page 
Without Hyperlink so that 
the page still appears in 
the menu, but no longer 
links anywhere.
When you preview the site, position the pointer over the menu item, and click, 
nothing happens. The submenu links (if there are any for that page), however, will 
still link to their respective pages. If you tried this, set the page to Include Page with 
Hyperlink again before continuing.
The menu has default formatting and some of the menu items aren’t fitting very 
well. Don’t worry; you’ll start to edit the appearance of the menu next.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
understanding the parts of a menu widget
You can set a lot of different formatting options for a menu widget, including 
background and border colors, text formatting, rounded corners, effects, and much 
more. That said, it’s important to understand how a menu widget is built and how 
to select its various parts before you add your favorite color.
The menu widget is a larger container that surrounds a series of inner containers. 
It’s a nested “group” of container objects, but not a group in the same sense as other 
Adobe applications. You can’t ungroup a menu. As you select a part of the menu 
widget, Muse displays a bounding box around that container to indicate which one 
is currently selected.
The figure shows the different containers, color coded and with exaggerated gaps 
between the containers to help you see them. (Those gaps do not show in the menu 
by default.)

Now that you understand how a menu widget is built in Muse, you are going to 
practice selecting and maneuvering amongst the various parts.
1 Choose Edit > Deselect All.
2 With the Selection tool, click the menu bar widget on the page to select it. On 
the left end of the Control panel, notice that the Selection Indicator displays the 
words “Menu Widget.”
3 Position the pointer over the word “HOME” in the menu, and you will see an 
outline appear around the smaller container. Click on the word “HOME.”
Notice that the words “Menu Item” appear on the left end of the Control panel 
in the Selection Indicator.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 71
4 Click once more on the word “HOME,” and the words “Text Frame” appear in 
the Selection Indicator in the Control panel.
5 Press the Escape key to select the container (called Menu Item) that the HOME 
text frame is in.
The Escape key lets you back up the hierarchy of nested elements.
6 Press the Escape key once more to select the menu widget.
P Note: You can also click away from the widget, and click to select the menu bar again.
Single-clicking repeatedly allows you to drill down into the menu content 
hierarchy, while pressing the Escape key moves you back up the hierarchy. 
As you start to style the menu bar, it’s important to select the correct part of 
the menu.
Next, you will edit the appearance of the menu bar using fills, strokes, and more.
edit the appearance of the menu bar
You can change the look of your menu bars by changing appearance settings. When 
an entire widget is selected, you can change its dimensions, appearance, and loca-
tion. With the subelements of a widget selected, you can format the contents (such 
as insert other objects, like images, text, and rectangles) as well as update each 
element’s appearance and dimensions within the confines of the widget itself. First, 
you will edit the size and appearance of the entire widget.
1 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
2 With the entire menu selected and the Selection tool selected in the Toolbox, 
drag the right-middle point of the container to the right until the measurement 
label shows a width of approximately 720px.
Because you selected Uniform Width for the Item Size in the menu bar 
options previously, Muse lets you manually resize the width of the entire menu. 
If you had selected Fit Width, you would not be able to resize the menu using 
this method.
P Note: Notice that 
the white arrow for the 
menu options is off the 
upper-right corner of 
the selected text frame. 
Clicking that options 
menu arrow reveals the 
same menu options you 
saw in the beginning.
P Note: Depending on 
your screen resolution, 
the panels on the right 
side of the workspace 
may get in the way. 
You may need to 
either scroll the page 
horizontally using the 
scroll bar at the bottom 
of the Document 
window or zoom out.

72 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
3 Choose Window > Transform. In the Transform panel, change the Height to 
38 by selecting the value in the Height (H) field and entering 38. Press Enter or 
Return to accept the value.
The Transform panel is just another way to edit the width or height of the 
menu. You’ll learn more about the Transform panel in Lesson 5, “Working with 
Shapes and Color.”
4 With the menu still selected, click the word “Fill” in the Control panel to reveal 
the fill options.
These options are the same as those you saw previously when adjusting the fill 
of the page area. Notice that you can now, however, select the Gradient option. 
Currently, the menu bar has no color fill (it is transparent), but you can change 
its appearance.
5 With Solid selected, click the arrow next to Color and select any red color. The 
background of the menu bar is now filled with the red color.
6 Change the Opacity value to 50 by selecting 100 in the Opacity field and typing 
50. Press Enter or Return to accept the value.
Changing the opacity is a great way to add unique design treatments.
P Note: If your screen 
resolution allows it, you 
may see the X, Y, W, H, 
and rotation options 
that you see in the 
Transform panel in 
the Control panel as 
well. You can make the 
transform edits in either 
location.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 73
7 Select Gradient, and notice that the menu bar background features a color 
gradient that incorporates the red from the previous steps.
A gradient is a linear blend from one color to another. You can adjust gradients 
in several different ways, including changing the colors. You will learn all about 
creating and manipulating gradient colors in Chapter 5, “Working with Shapes 
and Color.”
8 Select Solid, then click the arrow next to Color and select [None] ( ) to remove 
the red color. Press the Escape key to hide the Fill options.
Now that the menu bar appearance is finished, you can edit each of the menu 
items.
9 Click the word “HOME” to select the individual menu item.
All of the appearance options you’ve applied up to this point can also be applied 
to each menu item.
10 Click the up arrow to the right of the Stroke Weight option in the Control panel 
to change the stroke to 1px. Notice that a stroke (border) is applied to every one 
of the menu items, separately.
Aside from a stroke, you can also apply fills, including gradients, solid colors, 
and background images in each of the containers. You will learn more about 
strokes, fills, and colors in Lesson 5, “Working with Shapes and Color.” You can 
E Tip: You can also 
create an image in 
Adobe Photoshop, 
Illustrator, or similar 
program, save it in 
a web format, and 
then, using the Fill 
options, apply it as a 
background image to 
the entire menu bar.

74 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
also apply effects like drop shadows or rounded corners to the menu containers. 
You’ll learn about effects and rounded corners in Lesson 8, “Applying Effects, 
Graphic Styles, and Inserting HTML.”
E Tip: If you want each of the menu item containers to look different, you can deselect Edit 
Together in the menu bar options. After deselecting Edit Together, you can then select each menu 
item within the menu bar widget, add different fills, strokes, background images, rounded corners, 
and more to each, independently.
11 Remove the stroke by setting the Stroke Weight to 0 in the Control panel.
With the menu containers formatted, you can also format the menu bar text using 
different fonts, sizes, and a host of text formatting options.
format the menu bar text
When you insert a menu widget into your pages, the default font of the menu text 
is a sans-serif font like Helvetica or Arial. As easily as you formatted the containers, 
you can change the font of the text, as well as other appearance properties, such as 
the text’s fill and stroke.
1 In Design view, click away from the menu bar to deselect it. Click three times, 
slowly, on the HOME text in the menu bar to select the HOME text frame.
The words “Text Frame” appear in the Selection Indicator of the Control panel.
2 Click the Text panel tab on the right side of the workspace to show it.
P Note: You cannot edit the text that appears in the menu. That is controlled by the name of the 
pages in the site map. If you create a manual menu in the menu options, however, you must enter 
the text for the menu items.
3 Click the Font Family menu in the Text panel, and choose News Gothic Std Bold 
from the System Fonts (Exports As Image) menu. On Windows, you can choose 
News Gothic Std and click the Bold button in the Text panel.
In the menu, notice that each of the menu items has changed font family. Also, 
the image icon that appears to the right of the text in the menu has changed. 
That image icon indicates that the text in the menu will be converted to an image 
when the site is published. You will learn all about working with font families and 
other text formatting in Lesson 4, “Adding and Styling Text.”
E Tip: You can edit the 
text formatting like font 
family, size, and more 
without ever selecting 
the text in the menu. 
By selecting the entire 
menu bar widget, any 
changes you make to 
text formatting will 
affect all of the text in 
the menu bar.
P Note: If you do not 
see News Gothic Std 
Bold in the list, you can 
choose any other font, 
or refer to the “Fonts 
Used in this Book” 
section on page 2 of 
“Getting Started” to 
learn how to access the 
fonts supplied on the 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book disc.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 75
4 In the Text panel, change the Size to 12, by selecting it from the Size menu, 
clicking the arrows to the left of the size field, or typing the value directly into 
the field.
5 Change the Letter Space to 2.
Letter Space, as you’ll learn in the next lesson, adds 2 pixels of spacing between 
all characters in the menu bar.
6 Click the Color arrow, and select White as the color. Press the Escape key to 
close the Color Picker.
After changing the text to white, it will be difficult to see it. That’s okay. You will 
fix that shortly.
7 Click the word “Effects” in the Control panel to show the Effects options. Make 
sure that Shadow is selected at the top of the options. Select On to turn the 
shadow on, then set the shadow options as follows:
• Color: Black (default value)
• Opacity: 25
• Size: 3
• Angle: 45 (default value)
• Distance: 2
You can apply a lot of other formatting options to the text in the menu, including 
adding effects like bevel to create a 3D-like style of text. You will learn all about 
applying and editing Effects in Lesson 8, “Applying Effects, Graphic Styles, and 
Inserting HTML.”

76 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
Next, you’ll add an image to go behind the menu to make the menu text more 
readable.
8 Choose File > Place. Navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder. Select 
the image named top-nav.png, and click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS). 
Click to place the image on top of the menu bar widget.
9 Press and hold the letter “H” to select the Hand tool temporarily. Drag down 
until you see the logo in the header area. Release the H key.
10 Drag the new image with the Selection tool until the bottom of the image 
snaps to the top of the page area. A red line appears along the bottom edge of 
the image when it is snapped. Drag it horizontally until a red guide appears 
in the center of the page running from top to bottom. See the figure for 
placement help.
The red lines are part of the Smart Guides, which are turned on by default, and 
help you align content. You will learn more about working with Smart Guides in 
Lesson 4, “Adding and Styling Text.”
11 Choose Object > Send Backward to put the new image behind the menu.
Visually, nothing will change. When you drag the menu on top of the image, 
however, you’ll see that the menu is now on top of the image.
12 Drag the menu, centering it as best as you can vertically on the image with 
the menu bar aligned with the left edge of the new image. See the figure for 
placement help.
Because you made the text bigger and the letter spacing has spread the letters 
apart, the menu bar is a bit too narrow, but you’ll fix that next.
E Tip: If you need to 
nudge the menu bar, 
press an arrow key on 
your keyboard.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 77
13 With the menu widget still selected, click the Transform panel tab and change 
the width to 850px.
14 Click the Preview link above the Control panel and position the pointer over the 
menu. Notice the background color change to gray. Click one of the links, and 
notice that the background color of the page link you clicked on is dark gray.
The appearance changes that you see when interacting with the menu are called 
the states of the menu. Editing the appearance of these states is an important 
part of designing your menu, and the task you’ll work on next.
15 Click the Design mode link in the upper-left corner of the Application window 
to return to the A-Master page.
edit the menu states
A state is the appearance of a rectangle (in this case, a menu item), text frames, and 
image frames on a web page. States can change with user interaction. For example, if 
a visitor positions the pointer over an item in the menu, a menu item’s background 
color could change from none to blue.
You can edit the various states of Menu widget items by selecting the correct menu 
part and using the States panel.
1 In Design mode, click away from the menu bar to deselect it. Click twice, slowly, 
on the HOME link to select the HOME menu item.
2 Click the States panel tab (Window > States) on the right side of the workspace 
to show the States panel.
In the States panel, there are four states for every selected object.
3 Click the Rollover state, and Muse shows what the 
rollover state looks like on the page in the menu bar.
Once you select a state in the States panel, you 
can then edit the appearance of the state using 
any number of appearance options like fill, stroke, 
and more.
P Note: Remember 
that, by default, editing 
the appearance of one 
menu item will edit the 
rest in the menu.

78 
Lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
4 Click the Fill Color in the Control panel and select the color [None] ( ).
5 Click the Mouse Down state, then click the fill color in the Control panel and 
select the color [None].
P Note: Clicking the Reset To Default button in the States panel (the trash can icon in the lower-
right corner) with either the Rollover state or Active (Normal) state selected will make the selected 
state look like the Normal state. With the Mouse Down selected, clicking the Reset To Default button 
will make it look like the Rollover state. As of the writing of this book, this does not apply to every 
menu item, only to the menu item selected (in this case HOME).
6 Click the Active (Normal) state in the States panel.
The Active (Normal) state indicates the appearance of the menu item of the 
page currently showing in the browser window (it’s a link in the menu bar).
7 Click the Fill option in the Control panel, and select None from the Color menu, 
leaving the Fill options showing.
8 Click the folder icon to the right of the Image option, and navigate to the images 
folder in the Lessons folder. Select the image named topnav-over.png, and click 
Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
9 Make sure that Original 
Size is selected in the 
Fitting menu, and then 
select the center point 
of the Position reference 
point indicator ( ) to 
align it to the center. Press 
Escape to hide the Fill 
options.
E Tip: In Lesson 8, 
“Applying Effects, 
Graphic Styles, and 
Inserting HTML” you 
will learn how to 
save formatting as 
a graphic style that 
you can easily use 
throughout your 
document, making 
changes like these 
easily.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 79
about the states in the states panel
It is important to understand the different states in the States panel when working 
with menu bars. The definitions of each state that follow use the word “object” in 
place of the menu “item” because states can apply to more than just menu widgets.
• 
Normal: Specifies the default appearance of the object when the web page 
loads in the browser.
• 
Rollover: Specifies the appearance of the object when a visitor rolls over the 
object with the mouse pointer.
• 
Mouse Down: Specifies the appearance of the object when a visitor clicks it.
• 
Active (Normal): Specifies the appearance of the object when a visitor activates 
a particular page. This option is normally specified for menu bar widgets and 
tabbed panel widgets. For example, when a visitor is viewing the Products 
page, the Products item in a Menu Bar widget might register a separate color to 
denote that the visitor is on that (active) page.
10 Click the Preview mode link and position the pointer over the menu items, 
clicking on a few to see the resulting states.
11 Click the Design mode link to return to the A-Master page.
edit the submenu appearance
If you set the menu bar option to include the child pages as well, you will want to 
edit the appearance of the submenus in your menu, because the appearance prop-
erties you set for the menu top-level pages do not affect the submenu items. As you 
saw earlier in this lesson, the top-level pages in the site map appear in the menu 
and child pages appear as submenus.
1 While editing A-Master in Design mode, click away from the menu bar to 
deselect it. Click twice, slowly, on the PRODUCTS link to see the submenu 
appear.
2 Click once on the submenu to select the submenu container. The word 
“Container” appears in the Selection Indicator of the Control panel.
A submenu is similar in structure to the menu bar. Clicking once selects the 
main container. Clicking again on a menu item within the submenu selects that 
menu item. Clicking once more selects the text frame in that container. Pressing 
the Escape key moves you back up the hierarchy.
3 Drag the right-middle point of the submenu container to the left just a few 
pixels. The measurement label appears, showing you the width and height.

80 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
4 Drag the bottom-middle point of the submenu container down to make the 
submenu a few pixels taller.
Notice that dragging the edge of the entire submenu container resizes only the 
bottom menu item, Grinders, not the entire container.
5 Choose Edit > Undo Resize Item twice to return the menu to the default size.
6 Click the Coffee submenu item to select that menu item.
7 Click the Fill color in the Control panel to open the color options. Click the 
Eyedropper tool, and click the brown bar beneath the main menu items to 
sample the brown color.
Just like with the top-level menu items, if you edit the appearance of one 
submenu container, they all change. By sampling a color, you fill the selected 
object with the color sampled. You will learn how to save and edit that sampled 
color in Lesson 5, “Working with Shapes and Color.”
8 Click and drag the bottom-middle point of the Coffee container down until it’s 
30px in height.
9 Click the Grinders menu item, and drag the bottom-middle point of the 
container down until it is 30px in height as well.
10 Change the Stroke Weight in the Control panel to 0, if necessary.
11 Click the Text panel tab, and change the color to White. Click the Font Family 
menu in the Text panel, and choose News Gothic Std Bold from the System

Fonts (Exports As Image) menu. On Windows, you can select News Gothic Std 
and click the Bold button in the Text panel.
12 In the States panel, click the Rollover state and click the Fill color in the Control 
panel to open the color options. Click the Eyedropper tool, and click the brown 
bar beneath the main menu items to sample the brown color. In the Text panel, 
click the Color box and select the orange color swatch with the tooltip that 
shows R=251 G=176 B=59.
13 Select the Mouse Down state, and make sure that the color fill and the text color 
match the Rollover state.
14 In the States panel, select the Active (Normal) state and repeat sampling the fill 
color in step 12. In the Text panel, click the Color box and select the orange color 
swatch with the tooltip that shows R=251 G=176 B=59.
15 Choose View > Hide Rasterized Text Frame Indicators to see the menu without 
the indicators.
16 Choose View > Show Rasterized Text Frame Indicators to show them again.
17 Choose File > Save Site.
Assigning content to the footer
The main navigation typically appears in the menu near the top of the page. In the 
footer, most sites also contain a repeat of the main navigation or links to other useful 
information, such as contact details, brief information about the site, or a statement 
of site ownership. Corporate sites often use the footer to provide links to driving 
directions, telephone number, a web form (like a contact form), or at least an e-mail.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
1 Choose Edit > Deselect All.
2 With the Selection tool, click the menu widget, then choose Edit > Copy. 
Press and hold the H key, when the Hand cursor appears, drag the page up 
until you see the footer area at the bottom of the page. Release the H key. 
Choose Edit > Paste.
3 Attempt to drag the menu bar widget into the footer area, below the page area. 
Muse does not let you, because it considers the menu bar widget to be part 
of the page area. When you drag, the height of the page area simply increases 
instead.
To associate content with the footer and be able to drag that content into the 
footer area, you need to assign it as a Footer Item. Assigning an item to the 
footer also means that you cannot select it on the pages and that it will move 
with the footer if the page height grows or shrinks.
4 With the copied menu bar widget selected, select Footer in the Control panel.
5 Drag the copied menu bar down below the page area below the footer guide. You 
will be adding more content to the footer in Lesson 5, “Working with Shapes and 
Color,” but for now, leave the menu bar where it is.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
E Tip: You can also 
assign content to the 
footer by selecting 
the content on the 
page, right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-
clicking (Mac OS) and 
choosing Footer Item 
from the context menu 
or by choosing Object > 
Footer Item.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 83
Creating new master pages
Although a consistent, cohesive site design is important, that doesn’t mean every 
page should look exactly alike. Sometimes a group of pages within a site need their 
own identity. For example, you may want to design the individual product pages or 
customer feedback pages with a slightly different look and feel from the main pages. 
Muse lets you create multiple master pages for just this reason. You can either cre-
ate a new, blank master page based on the site properties or even duplicate an exist-
ing master page and make some changes to the copy.
Next, you will create a new, blank master page that you may use later on.
1 Click the Plan mode link above the Control panel.
2 In Plan mode, choose Page > Add New Master Page.
Muse creates a new, blank master page in the Masters area, with the same 
properties (width, column, and so on) as the current site properties (File > 
Site Properties).
3 Name the new master 
page Test. Because this 
new master page is blank, 
you could double-click the 
master thumbnail in Plan 
mode and add content to 
the master page later. Instead, you will duplicate the A-Master page and make 
some changes.
4 Position the pointer over 
the A-Master thumbnail 
in Plan mode. Right-click 
(Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS), and choose 
Duplicate Page from the 
context menu. Doing so 
creates a new master that is 
an exact copy of the A-Master page.
5 Name the new master page, MasterFlash.
6 Drag the MasterFlash thumbnail to the left, between the A-Master and Test 
thumbnails, if necessary. When the blue drop zone appears, release the mouse 
button.
E Tip: Just as you can delete pages in the site map, you can also easily delete a master page by 
positioning the pointer over its thumbnail and clicking the X that appears just off the upper-right 
corner of that same thumbnail.
E Tip: Another way 
to duplicate a master 
page is to hold down 
the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key 
while you drag a master 
thumbnail either 
between two master 
page thumbnails or 
to right of the master 
thumbnail farthest to 
the right. Release the 
mouse and then the 
key when the blue 
drop zone appears, and 
you’ve made a copy.

lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
You can easily reorder the master pages. This has no effect on the site, it can 
just be easier to either group similar master pages or put the most often used 
together.
7 Double-click the MasterFlash thumbnail to open the new master page in Design 
mode.
At this point, suppose you want this new master page to have two columns 
instead of three or to have a different page height. You could (but don’t) choose 
Page > Page Properties to edit those properties. In this case, you are going to 
replace the static logo image with Flash (.swf) content.
8 With the Selection tool, select the logo image in the header area and delete it.
9 Choose File > Save Site, and choose File > Close Page to close the MasterFlash 
master page. In Lesson 6, “Adding Images to Your Site,” you will add Flash 
content to the master page, making the static logo animated.
applying master pages
When you create a new master page, either a blank master or by duplicating an 
existing master page, that new master page isn’t applied to any of the pages in your 
site map. You can apply master pages to any number of pages, even having a unique 
master page for each page if you really wanted.
In the case of the KevinsKoffeeKart site, you will apply the MasterFlash master 
page to the HOME page. That way the SWF animation will play on the home page 
only and a static image (nonanimated), will appear on the rest.
1 In Plan mode, drag the Size slider in the Control panel, making sure that the 
page thumbnails still all fit in the Application window.
2 Drag the MasterFlash thumbnail onto the HOME page in the site map and 
release. Notice that the blue text beneath the page thumbnail, called the master 
badge, changed from A-Master to MasterFlash indicating that the Master Flash 
content is now on that page.
E Tip: Another way 
to apply a master 
page is to right-click 
(Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS) a page 
thumbnail in the 
site map and choose 
Masters > [name of 
the master to apply]. 
Using this method, you 
will also see the No 
Master option in the 
context menu. You can 
apply No Master to a 
unique page that you 
don’t want any master 
content on; the page 
will not associate with 
any master page.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 85
3 In the Control panel, deselect Master Badge. Notice that the master page names 
associated with the pages no longer show beneath the page thumbnails.
Sometimes, perhaps when you’re discussing the site map with a client or 
colleague, you want to look at the site map and just see the page thumbnails. 
Muse lets you show and hide the master badge for all pages.
4 Select Master Badge to show them again.
5 In the Control panel deselect Thumbnail, and you will see that the thumbnails 
turn into simple white boxes.
At times, you may also want to focus on the site map structure and not be 
distracted by a preview of the page in each thumbnail. You can also turn on and 
off the thumbnail preview.
6 Select Thumbnail again to see the previews once more.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
P Note: When you 
apply a different master 
page to a page in the 
site map, the previous 
master page content is 
removed from the page 
and replaced entirely by 
the new master page 
content.

86 
lesson 3 Working with Master Pages
testing your pages
During the course of the exercises, you’ve previewed the file by selecting Preview 
mode. This allows you to test links, hide all hidden items, and navigate the site like 
visitors will. While Preview mode is very useful, it does not show a few things in 
the site, such as the page title and favicon.
To give you the full user experience, Muse lets you test a page or your entire site in 
a browser outside of the program. That’s what you’ll do next.
1 Choose File > Preview Site In Browser.
Preview Site In Browser allows you to navigate between pages for an overview 
of the site. Choosing Preview Page In Browser, the other alternative, allows you 
to see only the current page in the Document window or the first page of the 
site if there are no open pages. If you click any of the links in the page, they will 
not work because you are only previewing the appearance of that single page.
2 Click the links in the menu bar to navigate to other pages.
The pages all look the same at this point, except for the HOME page, but in the 
next lesson, you will start to add page content to each page.
3 Close the browser window, and return to Muse.
4 Close all open pages, but leave the KevinsKoffeeKart.muse site file open for the 
next lesson.

review questions
1 What purpose do master pages serve?
2 What resolution are images typically in your website?
3 What purpose do the header and footer page guides serve on the master pages?
4 Where on a page does a background image in the browser fill appear?
5 Name the two ways that you can apply master pages to pages in Plan mode.
6 How do you assign content that is not in the footer area to the footer?
review answers
1 A master page in Muse contains content that is consistently on each page of your site, 
like a menu or logo. You can use just one default master page throughout your website, 
or you can create multiple master pages and apply them individually to other pages.
2 When designing for the web, the optimal resolution for images is 72ppi.
3 The header and footer page guides frame where the header and footer content appear 
on the page. They also determine how large either of those areas is. Content that is 
placed on a master page and appears above the header guide or below the footer guide 
is locked on each page (cannot be selected or edited).
4 When you insert a background image using the Browser Fill option in the Control 
panel, the image appears in the background of the browser window, behind the 
page area.
5 You can apply master pages to pages in your site by dragging a master page thumbnail 
in Plan mode onto a page in the site plan area. You can also apply a master page to a 
page in the site map by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac OS) a page 
thumbnail in the site plan area and choosing Masters > [name of the master to apply].
6 Select the content on the page and select Footer in the Control panel, right-click 
(Windows)/Control-click (Mac OS) the content, and choose Footer Item from the 
context menu, or select the content and choose Object > Footer Item.

Muse provides numerous tools for creating, editing, 
and formatting text, whether it’s created within the 
program or imported from another source.

90 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
Inserting text
In this lesson, you will explore the text formatting and the style options available to 
you in Muse.
Muse offers several ways to add text 
to your web pages. From typing text 
directly on your page to placing or 
pasting text from other applications, 
adding text to your design is simple.
Like in Adobe InDesign, text that 
you insert into your pages in Muse 
is contained within a text frame. You can resize, reposition, rotate, and transform 
those text frames and their content (which can include text and images), almost any 
way you like.
In this first section, you will insert text in various ways, then move on to formatting 
that same text.
typing text
The first method you’ll use to insert text into your pages is to create a text frame 
and simply type a page heading into it.
1 With the KevinsKoffeeKart.muse site file still open and Plan mode showing, 
double-click the ABOUT page thumbnail to open the page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Select the Text tool in the Toolbox. Position the pointer in the upper-left 
corner of the first column on the page, click and drag down and to the right to 
the right edge of the column. When the measurement label shows a height of 
approximately 40px, release the mouse button. A blinking cursor will appear 
within the text frame.
P Note: If you are 
starting from scratch 
using the Jumpstart 
method described in 
the “Jumpstart” section 
of “Getting Started,” 
your workspace may 
look different from the 
figures you see in this 
Lesson.

P Note: The exercises 
in this Lesson, like 
others in this book, 
require that you have 
the fonts supplied on 
the Muse Classroom in 
a Book disc installed 
on your machine. For 
more information on 
installing the necessary 
fonts, see “Fonts used in 
this book” on page 2.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 91
As you create the text frame, if the cursor comes close to a guide on the page, 
the frame you are drawing will snap to that guide and a red line will appear 
indicating that it is snapped.
4 Type About Koffee Kart in the text frame.
Muse uses Arial as the default font and 14 pixels as the default font size, 
whether you type or place your text onto your pages. You can change these 
settings easily and will do so in the “Formatting text” section on page 94.
5 Select the Selection tool in the Toolbox, and notice that the text frame, which is 
still selected, now has bounding points around it. Later, you’ll use these points 
to resize the text frame.
6 Click the center of the text frame and drag it toward the middle of the page.
Notice that the frame snaps to guides, and red lines and other visual aids 
display, depending on where you drag the frame and what its edges touch. The 
snapping feature and visual aids are part of Smart Guides and are turned on by 
default. In a later lesson, you will turn them off to reposition content when you 
don’t want it snapping to guides or other content.
7 Again from its center, drag the text frame into the upper-left corner of the 
first column guides, ensuring that the top and left edges of the frame snap 
into the guides.
P Note: When creating 
or editing frames in 
Muse, the more you 
zoom into the content, 
the finer the increments 
will appear in the 
measurement label.

92 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
about smart Guides
Smart Guides are temporary snap-to guides and pop-ups that appear when you 
create or manipulate objects. They help you align, edit, and transform objects 
relative to other objects, page guides, or both by snap-aligning and displaying gap 
measurements to help with consistent spacing between objects.
Smart Guides are turned on by default, but you can easily turn them off by choosing 
View > Smart Guides. Be aware, however, that when you turn off Smart Guides, you 
also turn off the snapping feature and visual aids.
8 With the frame selected, drag the bottom-middle bounding point of the frame 
down until the measurement label shows a height (H) of approximately 50px.
9 With the Selection tool, double-click the text frame to select the Text tool in the 
Toolbox and enable text editing.
10 Insert the cursor before the word, “Koffee” and type Kevin’s and then a space.
11 Choose File > Save Site.
Placing text
In Muse, you can place text (File > Place) from a file that was created in another 
application, provided it was saved as a .txt file. Because .txt files typically do not 
contain formatting, Muse applies default formatting to the text when you place 
the file.
1 Select the Selection tool in the Toolbox, and click away from the text frame to 
deselect it.
2 Choose File > Place. Navigate to the Lesson04 folder in the Lessons folder. Select 
the file called TextAbout.txt, and click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
You see the Place Gun cursor, which indicates that you can 
either click to create a text frame and place the text in it or 
you can click and drag to draw the frame to the proportions 
you want.
P Note: When the 
pointer is over the 
bounding point, the 
cursor will change 
to a double arrow, 
indicating that you can 
resize the frame.
P Note: You may want 
to zoom in to see the 
text more clearly.
P Note: You cannot 
place (File > Place) text 
into an existing text 
frame in Muse.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 93
3 Position the Place Gun cursor below the heading text on the left edge of the first 
column. Drag to the right and down until the pointer is on the right edge of the 
second column and the bottom edge of the new frame is about halfway down 
the page. This will make the text frame taller than needed, but that’s okay.
Unlike in Adobe InDesign, you can’t drag a frame to make it smaller than the 
content inside of it. You can, however, make the text frame taller.
4 With the text frame selected, click the Transform panel tab on the right side of 
the workspace if it’s not already showing. Change the Y value to 120 and press 
Enter or Return to accept it.
Instead of resizing or dragging a text frame using the Selection tool, you can be 
more precise by using the transform options in the Transform panel.
5 Choose File > Save Site.
6 Click the Preview mode link to preview the text.
7 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page.
Now that you have text on the page, you will begin to format it using the text for-
matting options available in Muse.
P Note: If your screen 
resolution allows it, 
you may see the X, 
Y, W, H, and rotation 
options that you see 
in the Transform panel 
in the Control panel as 
well. You can make the 
transform edits in either 
location.

94 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
Copy and paste text from  
another program
You can also copy and paste text from your favorite application, such as your e-mail 
client or InDesign, although the formatting is lost when you paste the text in Muse. 
Much like when you place or type text directly on the page in Muse, pasted text 
is formatted according to the program defaults for text, which are: Arial, 14px, 
black color.
When you need to bring in a lot of text from InDesign, you can export it as a .txt file. 
To do that, select the text in InDesign with the Type tool, choose File > Export, and 
then choose Text Only from the Format menu to complete the export.
formatting text
In this next section, you will learn a wide range of text formatting options available 
to you in Muse, from changing font size to adjusting paragraph spacing. You can 
find these formatting options in the Control panel (Window > Control) and Text 
panel (Window > Text).
The Text panel contains more formatting options than the Control panel, but 
sometimes the Control panel can be more convenient because it’s always showing 
(by default).
Open the Text panel, by choosing Window > Text, and take a look at some of the 
formatting features available.

adjusting font size
In print work, most of us use the unit points to set the size of our text. In Muse, the 
font size unit used is pixel.
1 Double-click the header text “About Kevin’s Koffee Kart” with the Selection tool 
to switch to the Text tool. Position the cursor over the text and click three times 
to select the text.
2 Select 24 from the Font Size menu in the Control panel.
3 Select the Selection tool, and drag the right-middle bounding point to the right 
until the text fits.
4 With the Text tool selected, insert the cursor in the text frame of the text you 
placed below the heading text. Choose Edit > Select All.
5 In the Font Size menu in the Control panel, select the value 14 and type 22. 
Press Enter or Return to accept the change.
6 Select the Selection tool, and notice that the text frame has gotten taller to fit 
the resized text.
You will also see a dotted line across the frame near the bottom of the text 
frame. This indicates a minimum height for the text frame. When you drag 
the frame shorter than the text and the dotted line appears, Muse inserts a 
P Note: Clicking text 
twice with the Text tool 
selects a word, clicking 
three times selects the 
paragraph, and clicking 
four times selects all of 
the text within a frame.
E Tip: To change the 
font size by 1-pixel 
increments, you can 
also click the arrows 
to the left of the Font 
Size field in the Control 
panel or Text panel.
E Tip: If you have a 
text frame to which 
you would like to 
apply all the same text 
formatting, you can 
select the text frame 
rather than the text 
and edit the formatting 
using the Text panel.

96 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
style property called min-height in the code. This tells the browser that the 
frame must be at least that tall and can expand taller if the content dictates it.
7 With the Selection tool, drag the bottom-middle bounding point down until the 
dotted line disappears. You won’t have to drag far.
E Tip: You can dynamically change the font size of selected text using keyboard shortcuts. 
To increase the font size in increments of 2 pixels, press Control+Shift+> (Windows), or 
Command+Shift+> (Mac OS). To reduce the font size, press Control+Shift+< (Windows), 
or Command+Shift+< (Mac OS).
selecting a font
For years, web designers and developers had to rely strictly on “web safe” fonts, 
which generally came installed on Mac OS and Windows machines, for their web 
designs. The reason for using web safe fonts was because any font you used in your 
web pages needed to be installed on the machine of the visitor viewing your web-
site in order for the text to render correctly.
Fortunately, times have changed! In fact, Muse supports three categories of fonts 
you can use:
• Web fonts: The newest category of font on the Web, these are fonts hosted by a 
company, sometimes for a fee. When a hosted font is viewed, your site visitor’s 
browser gets the font from that company’s server, so the font appears on your 
web page, regardless of whether that site visitor owns the specific font. Using 
Muse, you get access to hundreds of free fonts hosted by Adobe Typekit.
• Web safe fonts: Most systems or devices have these fonts installed, which 
increases the likelihood of them displaying correctly on your visitors’ machines.
• System fonts: These fonts are those located on your machine. If you apply one of 
these to text on your pages, Muse converts that text to an image when your site 
is previewed, published, or exported.
apply a web safe font
The first category of font you will use is a web safe font that you will apply to the 
placed text on the ABOUT page.
1 Double-click the placed text frame to switch to the Text tool. Insert the cursor 
in the text, and choose Edit > Select All.
2 Click the Font menu in the Control panel.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 97
In the Font menu that appears, you will see the three font categories available: 
Web Fonts, Web Safe Fonts, and System Fonts.
3 In the menu, position the pointer over the Web Safe Fonts option. Position the 
pointer over the font Georgia in the list that appears.
A yellow tooltip appears. In the tooltip, you’ll see the words “Alt Fonts:” and 
a listing of fonts. On the Web, if you choose a web safe font, just because it’s 
web safe doesn’t guarantee it will work, because visitors need to have the font 
(Georgia in this example) on their machines. The alt fonts are second, third, and 
so on choices for the browser, just in case Georgia isn’t available. You don’t have 
to worry about alt fonts, and you cannot change them in Muse. Just know that 
Muse selects fonts that are similar to your first choice font.
4 Click to select Georgia to apply that font to the text.
apply a system font
The next category of font you will use is a system font. Applying this type of font 
converts the text into an image.
1 With the Text tool still selected, select the heading text “About Kevin’s Koffee 
Kart.”
2 Click the Font menu in the Control panel, and position the pointer over the 
System Fonts (Exports As Image) option. In the menu of fonts that appears, 
scroll down and choose News Gothic Std Bold. This may cause the text to wrap 
in the text frame. On Windows, you can choose News Gothic Std and click the 
Bold button in the Control panel.

98 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
After selecting the system font, you will see a small T with an image icon appear 
in the lower-right corner of the text frame. That icon indicates that the text will 
become an image when you publish the site.
3 Select the Selection tool in the Toolbox. If necessary, drag the right-middle 
bounding point of the frame to the right until the text fits horizontally.
Make the frame a little wider than the text in case you make size or font changes 
later that make the text larger in any way.
4 Drag the bottom-middle point of the text frame up until it’s above the placed 
text frame, if necessary. That way they don’t overlap.
5 Click the Preview mode link, and check out the fonts.
6 Position the pointer over the placed text in Preview mode, then click and drag 
to select it. Because you can select it like you can in Design mode means it is 
still text. Position the pointer over the text “About Kevin’s Koffee Kart,” click, 
and drag. You will see that it selects as a single object, which means that it is an 
image.
7 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page in Design mode.
apply a web font
The next type of font that you will apply to text will be a web font. You will need 
an Internet connection to choose a web font the first time. Choosing a web font in 
Adobe Muse will download a local version of the font so that you can preview it in 
Muse when working on a site. Those fonts do not need to go with the site, because 
the code for your page will contain a link to the Typekit servers to view the font in 
the browser. Even if you decide to export the site content, and host the site else-
where, you can still use the web fonts that are chosen within Muse.
1 With the Text tool selected, select the heading text “About Kevin’s Koffee Kart.”
2 Click the Font menu in the Control panel, and position the pointer over the 
Web Fonts option. Click Add Web Fonts in the menu that appears.
3 In the Add Web Fonts dialog box, click the Sans Serif button in the Filter 
options.
Filtering allows you to see only specific font types, such as serif or sans serif. To 
stop filtering, click the Sans Serif button again.
E Tip: If you are 
looking for a particular 
font, you can type the 
name of the font in the 
Filter By Name field in 
the upper-left corner 
of the Add Web Fonts 
dialog box to search 
for it.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 99
E Tip: You can add web fonts to the Fonts menu without selecting text. Choose File > Add/Remove 
Web Fonts to access the Add Web Fonts dialog box.
4 Click the Recommended For Headings button to the right of the Filter options.
5 Click to select the font Oswald, and click OK.
6 When the Web Fonts Notification 
dialog box appears, click OK.
This dialog box indicates that the 
font you’ve chosen is added to the 
Font menu. This font will appear 
in the Font menu no matter what 
site file is open, allowing you to 
apply it to any site.
7 With the header text still selected, click the Font menu in the Control panel, and 
position the pointer over the Web Fonts option. Choose Oswald Bold (or the 
font you selected) from the menu that appears.
Next, you will remove the Oswald font and add another.
8 With the header text still selected, click the Font menu in the Control panel, and 
position the pointer over the Web Fonts option. Choose Add Web Fonts.
P Note: Since the 
Typekit library may 
have changed since we 
wrote this lesson, the 
Oswald font may not 
be available. Feel free 
to choose another font 
if you like. Just know 
that any references 
to Oswald later in the 
lessons will be your font 
instead.
P Note: For each font 
you choose, the entire 
font family is down-
loaded. This means that 
if there are any font 
styles such as bold or 
black, those font styles 
are downloaded as well.

100 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
9 In the Add Web Fonts dialog box, click the Show Selected Fonts button (the 
check mark) in the upper-right corner of the dialog box.
This shows a listing of all of the web fonts that you’ve selected in the past.
10 Click Oswald (or the font you selected) to deselect it and remove that font family 
from the Web Fonts menu.
11 Deselect Show Selected Fonts (the check mark icon) to see all of the fonts again.
12 Type Droid Sans in the Filter By Name field in the upper-left corner of the 
dialog box. Click to select the Droid Sans font in the list (the first listed, without 
the bar to the right of the name). Click OK.
13 Click OK in the Web Fonts Notification dialog box.
P Note: Any font 
styles in a family, like 
Oswald Bold, that are 
applied to text when 
you remove them in the 
Add Web Fonts dialog 
box, will remain in the 
Web Fonts section of 
the Font list. Also, if you 
remove fonts that are 
used in a site file that 
is not currently open, 
when you open that site 
after removing the font, 
it will be downloaded 
again automatically.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 101
14 With the header text still selected, click the Font menu in the Control panel, and 
position the pointer over the Web Fonts option. Choose Droid Sans Bold from 
the menu that appears.
15 Click the Preview mode link, and check out the fonts. Return to Design mode, 
and choose Edit > Deselect All.
Changing alignment, leading, and letter spacing
With the main formatting complete, you can begin to fine-tune some of the text 
to better suit your design. As mentioned earlier, you can change the formatting 
options in either the Text panel or the Control panel, depending on what tool or 
content is selected in Muse and the resolution of your screen.
1 With the Selection tool, click to select the header text frame that contains the 
text “About Kevin’s Koffee Kart,” if it’s not already selected.
2 Change the Letter Space option (
) to –1 in the Text panel on the right side of 
the workspace.
Letter spacing is the distance between characters (not just letters). When you 
select the entire text frame, Muse changes the spacing between all letters in the 
text frame. If you come from the print world, letter spacing is the web equivalent 
of tracking and kerning. Letter spacing uses pixel values rather than the typical 
print unit, points. On the Web, we typically use letter spacing for text like 
headlines, not entire stretches of body copy. Just keep in mind that every small 
kerning adjustment adds code to the HTML pages that Muse creates for you 
when you preview, publish, or export as HTML, which can ultimately increase 
download times for your pages.
3 Double-click the text frame to switch to the Text tool and insert the cursor 
between the apostrophe (’) and “s” in Kevin’s.
4 Press Control+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) a few times to zoom into 
the cursor position. (This is the shortcut for the View > Zoom In command.)

102 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
5 In the Text panel notice that the Letter Space is –1. Change the Letter Space 
to –2.
When you insert the cursor between characters, it controls the spacing between 
only those two characters. It also overrides the letter spacing for the two 
characters you set in the previous steps.
6 With the cursor still in the text, choose Edit > Select All and look in the Text 
panel. The Letter Space value is blank. This means that there is more than one 
Letter Space value applied to the selected text.
7 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
Now that the letter spacing is set, you will change the leading of the main text 
on the page. Leading refers to the distance between baselines of text (the space 
between lines of text).
8 Insert the cursor into the first paragraph of the text frame below the heading. 
Click three times to select the first paragraph (only).
In the Text panel, notice that the Leading value (
) is 120%. That means that 
the distance between the lines of text is 120% of the font size of the text.
9 Change the Leading value to 150% in the Text panel.
You do not have to type the percent sign as Muse will assume that the unit is 
percent. You can also enter a value with px (for pixel), like 32px, instead of a 
percent, and Muse will keep it as a pixel value.
10 Choose View > Fit Page In Window. With the Text tool, click and drag in the 
page’s third column from the left to create a text frame for a caption. Make sure 
the frame is the width of that column. Its vertical position in the column doesn’t 
matter right now.
P Note: You can 
enter a new value in 
the blank Letter Space 
field to apply a single 
letter-spacing value to 
the text.
P Note: If the panels 
are in the way, zoom 
out to see the third 
column.

11 Type Photo by: Karen Koffee in the text frame. Leave the cursor in the frame.
12 Press Control+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) a few times to zoom 
into the cursor position.
13 In the Text panel, click the Align Right button (
) to align the text to the right 
in the text frame.
Muse offers 4 alignment options: Left, Center, Right, as well as Align Justify.
14 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
15 Insert the cursor in the first paragraph of the main body text and click the Align 
Justify button (
) in the Text panel.
You’ll see that the Align Justify option justifies the entire paragraph (makes it 
look like a block of text), except for the last line of text in the paragraph.
16 Choose Edit > Undo Set Text Align. You could also have clicked the Align Left 
button in the Text panel.
17 Choose File > Save Site.

lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
adjusting paragraph indents, margins, and spacing
The text formatting options covered in this exercise reside in the Text panel only. 
You will create a quote in your text while utilizing these options.
1 Select the Selection tool, and choose File > Place. Navigate to the Lesson04 
folder in the Lessons folder, select the text file named TextQuote.txt, and click 
Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
2 Position the Place Gun in the third column, away from the caption text. Drag 
out a text frame that is the width (roughly) of the third column.
3 Double-click the text frame to switch to the Text tool. Choose Edit > Select All, 
then Edit > Copy to copy the text.
4 Insert the cursor in front of the paragraph that starts “The Koffee Kart 
specializes” and choose Edit > Paste. Press Enter or Return to add a paragraph 
return after the pasted text.
The text frame will grow to fit the new text.
5 Select the Selection tool; a dotted line indicating the minimum height may 
appear. Drag the bottom-middle bounding point of the text frame down a bit 
until dotted line disappears.
You can also tell by the measurement label that appears. When the H and 
Min H values are the same, then the dotted line no longer shows.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 105
6 Select the text frame in the third column that you copied the quote from, and 
press Delete to remove it.
Now that the text is on the page, you will apply the formatting options to format 
the quote text.
7 Select the Text tool in the Toolbox, and select the quote text you pasted. Click 
the Italic button (
) in the Text panel.
If you come from a program like InDesign, you may be used to choosing a 
separate bold or italic font style. On the Web, assigning bold or italic is perfectly 
acceptable, and Muse has buttons in the Text panel for bolding, italicizing, and 
underlining text.
8 In the Text panel, change the Left Margin (
) to 40 and the Right Margin (
) 
to 40 as well. Change the Leading value to 150% or whatever you think 
looks good.
9 Change the Space Before (
) to 30 and the Space After (
) to 30.
E Tip: You can press the Tab key to move the cursor forward between fields or Shift+Tab to move 
the cursor backward through the fields in the panels.
The Left Margin, Right Margin, Space Before, and Space After values are pixel 
values. You can type in a % value like 10% in any off these four settings, and 
Muse will convert the value to pixels.
10 Change the Indent to 10 in the Text panel, and you’ll see that only the first line 
of the quote is pushed in. Change the Indent to –10 and you can achieve an 
outdent or hanging indent.
Changing the Indent to –10 moves the first line to the left of the left edge of the 
paragraph.
E Tip: You could also 
select the text frame 
and choose Edit > Clear.
E Tip: The Left and 
Right Margin values can 
also be negative values. 
Using this negative 
value, you can pull the 
left and/or right side 
of a paragraph outside 
of the text frame in 
Muse to create some 
interesting type effects.

106 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
At this point, using the formatting you’ve learned so far, you can adjust the letter 
spacing between the quote mark (") and the text, and much more.
Keep in mind, however, that changing the font size of the first quote mark (") also 
changes the spacing of your paragraph. If you want a big first quote mark, you can 
create a separate text frame or even place an image to the left of the quote text or 
paste it into the text frame. (If you use a graphic, don’t forget to delete the quote 
character in the text.)
Changing the color and case of text
The last bit of text formatting you’ll learn about is changing the color of text and 
changing the case of text between lowercase and uppercase.
1 With the Text tool, select the header text “About Kevin’s Koffee Kart.”
2 Click the Color option in the Text panel (or Control panel) and change the RGB 
values to R: 110, G: 51, B: 41 to change the color of the heading text. You can 
press Return or Escape to save the change and close the Color Picker.
3 Choose Edit > Change Case > UPPERCASE to capitalize all of the selected 
headline text.
E Tip: You could also right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) on the text and choose 
Change Case > UPPERCASE from the context menu.
4 Choose File > Save Site.
Now that you’ve explored the text formatting options in Muse, you’ll learn how to 
work faster and with more consistency using paragraph and character styles.
Creating type styles
Using styles in Muse, you can quickly apply consistent formatting to text and make 
global changes across multiple pages in your site. After you create a style, you can 
update all of the text throughout your site that uses that particular style simply by 
editing the saved style. This is very similar to how styles in InDesign or Illustrator 
E Tip: To learn more 
about pasting content 
into text, see the 
section “Create a Dotted 
Line” on page 128 of 
Lesson 5, “Working with 
Shapes and Color.”
P Note: You will 
learn about creating 
and editing colors in 
Lesson 5, “Working with 
Shapes and Color.”
P Note: If the text is 
wrapping in the text 
frame, change the width 
of the text frame with 
the Selection tool to fit 
the text horizontally.

work. You can access Paragraph Styles in the Paragraph Styles panel (Window > 
Paragraph Styles) of Design mode.
When you publish your site for the world to see, Muse automatically converts your 
styles to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules and applies them throughout your 
website.
Muse supports two types of styles:
• Paragraph styles retain text and paragraph attributes; apply them to an entire 
paragraph.
• Character styles retain text attributes only; apply them to selected text.
In addition, when you create a new site in Muse, a style named [None] appears 
by default in the Paragraph Styles panel. You can use this style to remove format-
ting from text to which you applied a paragraph style. As a best practice, apply 
text  formatting using paragraph and character styles; doing so can cut down on 
your effort in Muse and also make a smaller site that has the potential to download 
faster on the Web.
Creating and applying paragraph styles
Paragraph styles apply formatting to an entire paragraph and encompass all of the 
formatting options found in the Text panel, including font size, alignments, indents, 
and more. Next, you will create a paragraph style to save the formatting for the 
heading text and another style for the main body text on the ABOUT page so that 
you can apply that formatting elsewhere easily. Remember, after you create a style, 
it appears in the Paragraph Styles panel no matter which page of the site is open.
1 Click the Paragraph Styles panel tab on the right side of the workspace.
Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the options in the Paragraph Styles 
panel. As you progress through this exercise, you will learn about each of these 
options.

lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
2 With the Text tool, click three times in the first paragraph that begins with 
“Koffee Kart began as a whim …” to select it.
3 In the Paragraph Styles panel, click the Create 
A New Style button (
) at the bottom of the 
panel.
Muse saves the formatting from the selected text 
as a paragraph style and adds it to the Paragraph 
Styles panel. By default, Muse names the new 
style Paragraph Style, but you can, and should, 
rename it.
4 In the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click the style named Paragraph Style to 
open the Style Options dialog box.
5 Change the Style Name to GeorgiaBody.
In the Style Options 
dialog box, notice that the 
formatting options that were 
saved from the paragraph 
text appear. Also, you will 
see the Paragraph Tag menu. 
To learn more about the 
Paragraph Tag menu, see 
the “Paragraph_tags.pdf” 
file in the Lesson04 folder. 
Click OK.
When you create a new style from selected text, Muse does not automatically 
apply the style to that text; edits to the style would not affect the paragraph on 
which you originally based the style. To apply the new style to its paragraph of 
origin, you must apply the style after you make it. Double-clicking to name the 
style does that for you as well as lets you change the name to something that 
makes sense.
You can always tell which style is applied to text by selecting that text or 
inserting the cursor in it and looking in the Paragraph Styles panel where the 
applied style’s name will be highlighted.
6 Position the cursor over the new style in the 
list, now named GeorgiaBody.
A yellow tooltip appears, listing the style 
settings. This can help you to differentiate 
between styles with similar names.
P Note: You do 
not have to select a 
paragraph to create a 
paragraph style. You can 
simply insert the cursor 
in the text, then click 
the Create A New Style 
button.
P Note: The order 
of your settings may 
be different and that’s 
okay.
P Note: The order 
of your settings in the 
tooltip may be different 
and that’s okay.

7 With the Text tool selected, select the header text “ABOUT KEVIN’S KOFFEE 
KART.” Repeat steps 3 to 5, naming this new style, Heading.
8 Insert the cursor into the paragraph that begins “The Koffee Kart specializes.” In 
the Paragraph Styles panel, click the GeorgiaBody style to apply it to the text.
You can either simply insert the cursor in text or select the entire paragraph (or 
more) to apply paragraph styles.
After you create a paragraph style and begin working in your pages, you may 
change your mind later on and want to change the settings in the style. In Muse, 
when you change style settings, every paragraph that has that paragraph style 
applied will update.
Clearing overrides and editing a paragraph style
In Muse, changing a paragraph style setting is called redefining a style. To redefine a 
style, you edit the formatting for text that has the paragraph style applied. Then you 
redefine the style based on the changes. This makes the paragraph style match the 
new settings, and all other paragraphs with that style applied automatically update 
to match.
1 With the Text tool, select the heading text “ABOUT KEVIN’S KOFFEE KART.” 
In the Control panel, change the Letter Space value to 0.
Look in the Paragraph Styles panel. You can tell that the style named Heading 
is applied because it is highlighted, but you will also see a plus (+) to the right 
of the name. The plus indicates local formatting on the selected text. Local 
formatting means that there is formatting on the selected text that is different 
from the paragraph style applied to it.
2 Position the pointer over Heading+ in 
the Paragraph Styles panel. A yellow 
tooltip appears displaying the style 
settings, a dashed line (-----), and 
then kerning: 0. Settings listed below 
the dashed line indicate formatting 
on the selected text that is not a part 
of the applied paragraph style.
P Note: If the 
resolution of your 
screen allows it, you 
may also see the 
Paragraph Style menu 
in the Control panel. 
This is another way to 
apply paragraph styles 
to your text.
P Note: Changing the 
letter spacing may wrap 
the text in the frame. If 
that’s the case, select 
the Selection tool and 
drag the frame’s right-
middle bounding point 
to the right until the 
text fits on one line.
P Note: Notice that 
the uppercase you 
applied is not listed 
in the tooltip. That’s 
because uppercase 
cannot be saved in a 
paragraph style.

110 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
3 Click the Clear Style Overrides button (
) at the bottom of the Paragraph 
Styles panel to remove the letter spacing applied to the heading text.
This strips the formatting from the selected text, and reapplies the currently 
applied paragraph style. The plus (+) sign that was displayed to the right of the 
paragraph style’s name disappears once you click the Clear Style Overrides button.
4 With the Text tool, select the entire first paragraph that starts with the text 
“Koffee Kart began as …” In the Control panel, change the Leading to 140%. 
Also, click the Color option in the Control panel, and change the RGB values 
to: R: 110, G: 97, B: 97.
E Tip: For any value in a field that you want to change, you can select the value in the field (like the 
150% in the Leading field), press the up or down arrow to change the value. You can also press and 
hold the Shift key while pressing the up or down arrows to change the value in larger increments.
5 Press Enter or Return until the color options are hidden.
Once again, look in the Paragraph Styles panel and you will see a plus appear 
next to the style named GeorgiaBody. Instead of clearing the overrides 
(removing the extra formatting), you will change the style to match the first 
paragraph formatting (including the new leading value and color).
6 In the Paragraph Styles panel, position the pointer over the applied style named 
GeorgiaBody + and take a look at the overrides at the bottom of the yellow 
tooltip.
7 Click the Redefine Selected Style button (
) at the bottom of the panel.
Notice that the plus is gone from the right of the GeorgiaBody style name and 
that the bottom paragraph has updated to reflect the new formatting.
E Tip: To clear the 
overrides on selected 
text, you can also 
right-click (Windows) 
or Control-click (Mac 
OS) the style name in 
the Paragraph Styles 
panel and choose Clear 
Overrides from the 
context menu.
E Tip: To redefine a 
style, instead of clicking 
the Redefine Selected 
Style button, you can 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
the style name and 
choose Redefine Style.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 111
8 Choose File > Save Site and leave the first paragraph selected for the next 
section.
Deleting and duplicating a paragraph style
In Muse, you may wind up creating multiple paragraph styles that are very 
similar to each other. For instance, you may want to create two versions of the 
GeorgiaBody style, with only a difference in font size. In that case, instead of creat-
ing a whole new style to closely match another, you can duplicate an existing style 
and adjust the formatting as necessary.
1 In the Paragraph Styles panel, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac 
OS) GeorgiaBody, the style applied to the selected text. Choose Duplicate Style 
from the context menu to create an exact copy of the style. Muse names it, not 
surprisingly, GeorgiaBody copy.
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac OS) the new style (GeorgiaBody 
copy) and choose Rename Style from 
the context menu. Change the name of 
the style to GeorgiaBody small, and 
press Enter or Return.
Renaming a style this way does not 
apply the new style to any selected text.
In order to change the style duplicate, 
you will redefine the style. First, you 
need to apply the style to some text.
3 Click GeorgiaBody small in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply it to the selected 
first paragraph. The paragraph will not change in appearance because the style 
is just a duplicate.
4 Change the Font Size in the Control panel to 20 by typing 20 and pressing Enter 
or Return.
5 Click the Redefine Selected Style button at the bottom of the Paragraph Styles 
panel to update the GeorgiaBody small style to match the selected text.
You will use the new GeorgiaBody small style in place of the GeorgiaBody style. 
To do this, you can simply apply the new style to selected text and keep the 
original GeorgiaBody style, or you can choose to delete the original GeorgiaBody 
style (if you no longer need it), and Muse allows you to choose a style to replace 
it with. You will do the latter.
6 Choose Edit > Deselect All in preparation for deleting the style.
7 In the Paragraph Styles panel, select the GeorgiaBody style. Click the Delete The 
Selected Style button (
) at the bottom of the panel.
E Tip: To delete a style, 
you can also right-click 
(Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS) the style 
name and choose 
Delete Style in the 
context menu.

112 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
8 In the dialog box that appears, choose  
GeorgiaBody small and click Replace.
The GeorgiaBody style is now gone and the 
last paragraph has the GeorgiaBody small 
style applied. Notice the text now displaying 
in the specified smaller font.
9 Choose View > Hide Guides to temporarily 
hide the guides and get a better sense of 
what the text looks like on the page.
10 Choose View > Show Guides to show the guides again.
unlinking a paragraph style
At times, you may want to strip the formatting from text and start over. Or, perhaps 
you want text to retain the formatting you originally applied to it with a paragraph 
style, regardless of changes you later make to that style. Both tasks are simple to 
accomplish in Muse.
1 With the Text tool selected, select the heading ABOUT KEVIN’S KOFFEE KART.
2 In the Paragraph Styles panel, select the [None] style to remove the formatting 
and replace it with default formatting.
3 Click the Heading style to reapply the style formatting.
4 With the Text tool, select the caption paragraph “Photo by: Karen Koffee.”
The caption is formatted, but it doesn’t have a paragraph style applied. You can 
easily strip the formatting from this sort of text as well, but you need to take 
a different route. In the Paragraph Styles panel, notice that the [None] style 
is already applied. That means that you cannot reapply that style to strip the 
formatting, but you can apply any other style, then click [None] again.
5 Select any other style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply it to the text.
6 Select the [None] style to set the formatting back to default. Leave the text 
selected for the next steps.
7 Select the Heading style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply the style to the 
caption paragraph.
Applying this style creates a starting point for formatting.
E Tip: If you find 
yourself losing track 
of which of your many 
styles are actually in 
use in your site, Muse 
offers a quick solution. 
Right-click (Windows) 
or Control-click (Mac 
OS) a style name in the 
Paragraph Styles panel 
or the Character Styles 
panel, and choose 
Delete Unused Styles 
to delete all the styles 
that you are not using. 
Bear in mind, you will 
need to clean out the 
Paragraph Styles and 
Character Styles panels 
separately.
P Note: You may want 
to zoom in a bit to see 
all of the text.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 113
The last piece of working with paragraph styles involves unlinking a style from 
text. If you want to create a style similar to another style or apply a style, but 
don’t want that text to update when the style updates, you can unlink the style 
from the text.
8 Click the Unlink Style From Selection button (
) at the bottom of the 
Paragraph Styles panel.
This applies the [None] style to the text, but leaves all of the Heading style 
formatting. You can now change the formatting of the selected text however you 
like and it will never update if the Heading style is redefined.
9 Change the Font Size to 12, click the Italic button, click the Align Right button, 
and change the letter spacing to 0 in the Control panel. Notice that the caption 
text that you see may not appear to be italics.
10 Choose View > Preview Mode. The Preview Problem dialog box may appear 
indicating that the web font you chose, Droid Sans Bold, does not have an italic 
style and it will be simulated. Click OK.
11 Choose View > Design Mode to return to the ABOUT page.
12 Choose File > Save Site.

lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
Creating and applying a character style
Paragraph styles apply attributes to an entire paragraph, but you can apply character 
styles to selected text only. Character styles can include only the following formatting 
options: font, font size, color, styles (italic, bold, underline), and letter spacing. You 
access character styles from the Character Styles panel (Window > Character Styles).
Next, you will format the proper name “Koffee Kart” and apply that formatting 
throughout the page using a character style. Just know that once a character style is 
created, it appears in the Character Styles panel if any page in the site is open.
1 Click the Character Styles panel tab on the right side of the workspace.
Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the options in the Character Styles 
panel. They are the same as the Paragraph Styles panel.

5 Click the Text Color in the Control panel and choose the red color swatch (color 
square) that shows R=193 G=39 B=45 in the yellow tooltip when you position 
the pointer over it. See the figure for the correct red color.
6 With the text “Koffee Kart” still selected, click the Create A New Style button 
(
) at the bottom of the Character Styles panel.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 115
Position the pointer over the new style named Character Style, and you’ll see 
the saved formatting appear in a yellow tooltip, just like in a paragraph style.
7 Double-click the new style named Character Style. In the Style Options dialog 
box, change the Style Name to proper name and click OK.
As with a paragraph style, by double-clicking to name the character style right 
away, you also apply it to the selected text from which the style was made.
8 Select the first occurrence of Koffee Kart in the third paragraph.
9 Click the style named “proper name” in the Character Styles panel to apply that 
formatting to the text.
10 Click the Preview mode link to see the page in Preview mode.
11 Click the Design mode link to return to the page.
12 Choose File > Save Site.
editing a character style
Editing a character style and the rest of the options in the Character Styles panel 
work identically to the Paragraph Styles panel.
1 With the Text tool, select the phrase “Koffee Kart” in the first paragraph.
2 Change the color of the text in the Control panel to a dark gray that appears as a 
swatch in the color options.
3 In the Character Styles panel, position the pointer over the applied style (proper 
name +) and take a look at the overrides at the bottom of the yellow tooltip.
E Tip: If your screen 
resolution allows it, 
you may also see the 
Character Style menu in 
the Control panel. This 
is another way you can 
apply a character style.

116 
lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
4 Click the Redefine Selected Style button (
) at the bottom of the panel.
Notice that the plus is gone from the right of the proper name style name and 
that the other Koffee Kart text has updated to reflect the new formatting.
5 Choose File > Save Site.
When working with Character Styles, you will find that a lot of the features like 
duplicating, deleting, unlinking, and more are identical in functionality to para-
graph styles.
Now that you have your text formatted and your styles created, you will copy some 
content from another site.
Pasting text between Muse sites
In this section, you’ll copy some text content from one page and paste it onto 
another. Copying and pasting text between pages in a site lets you keep the format-
ting. If you copy and paste text from one site to another site, the formatting is 
retained, and Muse copies any necessary text styles into the second site. This can be 
a great way to quickly duplicate styles from one site to another.
First, you need to add pages for this new content.
1 Click the Plan mode link with your site showing.
2 Position the pointer over the THE KOFFEE page thumbnail, and click the plus 
sign (+) beneath the thumbnail to create a new child page. Name the page 
Preparation.
3 Position the pointer over the new 
Preparation page thumbnail, and click 
the plus sign (+) to the right of the 
thumbnail to create a new sibling page. 
Name the page Origins.
4 Double-click the Preparation 
thumbnail to open the page in Design 
mode.
5 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
6 Choose File > Open Site. Navigate to the Lesson04 folder in the Lessons folder. 
Choose the file named CopyText.muse, and click Open (Windows) or Select 
(Mac OS). This is the site from which you’re going to copy the content.
7 With the new site open in Plan mode, double-click the Preparation page 
thumbnail to open the page in Design mode.
P Note: The two new 
pages you added will 
become a submenu in 
the menu. It will need 
to be formatted to look 
like the other submenu 
you formatted in Lesson 
3. You will do that in 
Lesson 8, “Applying 
Effects, Graphic Styles, 
and Inserting HTML.”

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 117
8 Choose Edit > Select All, then Edit > Copy.
9 Choose File > Close Site to close the site file and the Preparation page.
You should now be back on the Preparation page you just created in your site.
10 Choose Edit > Paste In Place.
Pasting in place is a great way to paste content in the same relative location on a 
page as it was on the page you copied it from.
11 Open the Paragraph Styles  
panel, and notice the new 
style named StepBody 
small.
Any styles associated with 
the copied text are brought 
into the site into which you 
are pasting the text. If you 
paste text with a style that has the same name as a style in the page that you are 
pasting the text into, the existing style overrides the new style you are pasting.
12 Choose File > Close Page to close the Preparation page and return to the 
ABOUT page.
13 Click the Preview link to preview the text changes on the ABOUT page, then 
click the Design mode link to return to Design mode.
14 Choose File > Save Site.
Rotating a text frame
As you’ve seen so far in this lesson, you can transform a text frame in multiple ways, 
including position and size. But you can also rotate a text frame. If you rotate text 
frames in Muse, the text in them is converted to an image when the site is  previewed, 
published, or exported to HTML. It’s really best to rotate only small pieces of text, 
because images can add to the download time of the pages in the browser.
You will rotate the caption text frame so that when you place an image in Lesson 6, 
“Adding Images to Your Site,” you can position the text frame vertically to the right 
of the image.
1 Select the Selection tool in the Toolbox, and click to select the caption text frame.
2 Press Control+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) a few times to zoom 
into the caption text frame.
3 Position the pointer off any corner point on the frame, and you’ll see a rotate 
symbol (
) appear.
P Note: You pasted 
images as well as text 
from the CopyText.muse 
site. When you copy and 
paste images between 
sites, the pasted images 
are linked to the same 
location as the original 
copied images. You 
will learn more about 
linking in Lesson 6, 
“Adding Images to 
Your Site.”

lesson 4 
Adding and styling text
4 Click and drag in a clockwise  
fashion. As you drag, press 
and hold the Shift key. Drag 
until the frame is vertical on 
the page. Release the mouse 
button and then the 
Shift key.
Muse shows a rotation 
value as you rotate in the 
Transform panel and allows 
you to change the rotation 
value numerically.
Also notice that after the 
text frame is rotated, the Rasterized Text Frame Indicator appears in the corner 
of the frame. It looks like a letter “T” with an image icon next to it. This indicates 
that the text frame will become an image when the site is published or exported.
5 Open the Transform panel (Window > Transform), and you’ll see the Rotation 
Angle (
) value. Make sure that the Rotation Angle is 270.
Because you are going to place an image in a later lesson and align the caption 
text frame to it, leave it where it is for now.
6 With the Selection tool, drag the left edge (what used to be the bottom edge 
before rotation) to the left to close up the frame around the text, if necessary.
7 Choose File > Close Page.
8 Choose File > Save Site, and leave the site open in Plan mode for the next lesson.
In the next lesson, you will explore how to create and edit shapes as well as create 
and edit color in Muse.
E Tip: You could also 
avoid manually rotating 
with the Selection tool. 
Instead, simply select 
the object to be rotated 
and type the value in 
the Rotation Angle field 
in the Transform panel.
P Note: If you have 
a large enough screen 
resolution, you may 
see the Rotation Angle 
option in the Control 
panel as well.

6 What happens to text when you rotate its frame?
review answers
1 In Muse, you can type text directly into your pages after creating a text frame using the 
Text tool, you can paste text from almost any other application (the formatting will be 
lost), you can choose File > Place to place a .txt file, or you can copy text from another 
Muse site and paste the text into the site, retaining the formatting (and styles) of the 
text content.
2 Smart Guides are temporary snap-to guides and pop-ups that appear when you create 
or manipulate objects. They help you align, edit, and transform objects relative to 
other objects, page guides, or both by snap-aligning and sometimes displaying gap 
measurements to help evenly space multiple objects.
3 The three categories of fonts that can be used in Muse are: web safe fonts, web fonts, 
and system fonts.
4 Paragraph styles apply attributes to an entire paragraph, but character styles can be 
applied to selected text only. Character styles can include only the following formatting 
options: font, font size, color, styles (italic, bold, underline), and letter spacing.
5 The easiest way to bring paragraph and character styles from one site to another is to 
copy and paste text that has the desired styles applied from one site to another.
6 The text in the text frame is converted to an image when the site is previewed, 
published, or exported as HTML.

lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
Working with shapes
Muse comes with a single shape tool called the Rectangle tool, but don’t be fooled 
by its name: You can create much more than boxes with it. In this section, you will 
use the Rectangle tool to create rectangles, lines, and circles, as well as learn other 
everyday formatting options. First, you’ll prepare a page:
1 With your KevinsKoffeeKart site open in Plan mode, double-click the A-Master 
page to open that page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window, then press Control+- (Windows) or 
Command+- (Mac OS) twice to zoom out.
This shortcut is for the View > Zoom Out command.
3 Press and hold the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool. Click and drag 
up with the mouse until you see the footer area and below. Release the mouse 
and then the spacebar.
P Note: If you are starting from scratch using the Jumpstart method described in the “Jumpstart” 
section on page 5 of “Getting Started,” your workspace may look different than the figures you see in 
this lesson.
Drawing with the rectangle tool
In the footer of the A-Master page, you will first insert a rectangle to give the footer 
some color.
1 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Toolbox.
2 Below the footer page guide, and starting on the left edge of the page area, 
click and drag to the right and down to create a rectangle frame. When the 
measurement label that appears shows a height of approximately 200px and 
the right edge of the rectangle frame snaps to the right edge of the page area, 
release the mouse.
The measurement label shows the height and width of the rectangle you are 
drawing.
E Tip: If you hold down the Shift key before you begin drawing with the Rectangle tool, then 
release the mouse button followed by the Shift key, you can create a perfect square.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.
P Note: The exercises 
in this lesson, like others 
in this book, require 
that you have the 
fonts supplied on the 
Adobe Muse Classroom 
in a Book disc installed 
on your machine. For 
more information on 
installing the necessary 
fonts, see “Fonts used in 
this book” on page 2.
E Tip: To see finer 
increments in the 
measurement label, you 
can zoom into the page 
before you draw the 
rectangle.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 123
3 Click the Preview mode link and scroll down in Preview mode, if necessary, to 
see the rectangle frame in place.
By default, frames you draw have a white fill color and a black, 1-pixel stroke. 
You will learn all about how to change the color fill and stroke of this shape in 
the “Working with color” section on page 130.
4 Click the Design mode link to return to Design mode.
5 Click the Transform panel tab and make sure that 
the X value is 0 and the Y value is 685.
The Transform panel also allows you to enter exact 
dimensions for width and height as well as rotation, 
if you want it to match the dimensions of another 
object, for instance.
6 Select the Selection tool in the Toolbox, and drag the bottom-middle bounding 
point of the frame down until it snaps to the bottom of browser guide. A red 
line will appear when the pointer touches the guide.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
Creating 100% width content
Content you place or create in Muse, like a rectangle frame, has a defined width and 
height. That means that it won’t change size when displayed at different screen reso-
lutions and it will center, by default, with the rest of the page content in the browser 
window.
You can, however, create shapes and text frames that stretch to fill the width of the 
browser window. This is called 100% width content. A rectangle or text frame that 
you give 100% width characteristics resizes to fill the page no matter the screen 
resolution or browser window size.
1 With the frame still selected, drag the left bounding point to the left until it 
snaps to the edge of the page width. A vertical red line will appear to indicate 
that it has snapped.
P Note: In the 
Transform panel, 
the X value specifies 
where the left edge of 
the selected object is 
relative to the left edge 
of the page area. The 
Y value indicates where 
the top of the selected 
object is relative to 
the top of page guide. 
Changing the X and Y 
values of selected 
content positions the 
upper-left corner of the 
selected object to those 
coordinates.

124 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
2 Drag the right bounding point to the right until it snaps to the right edge of the 
page width and a vertical red line also appears.
3 Click the Preview mode link, and scroll down to see the footer rectangle, if 
necessary.
On page 134, you will add color to the rectangle so that it better matches the 
design.
4 Click the Design mode link to return to Design mode.
5 With the rectangle frame selected, choose Object > Send To Back.
This step sends the rectangle to the bottom of the stack so it will now be behind 
the menu in the footer. Your menu may be showing the submenus, and that’s okay.
6 With the Selection tool, click to select the footer menu. Click the blue circle with 
the white arrow in the upper-right corner of the menu. In the Options menu, 
choose Top Level Pages from the Menu Type menu, and choose Fit Width from 
the Item Size menu. This will make the menu smaller and will no longer show 
the submenus.
P Note: You may see 
the submenus as well 
in the footer menu and 
that’s okay.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 125
7 Drag the footer menu  
so that it is positioned 
approximately like in 
the figure, centering it 
against the page area. 
As you drag the menu, a center Smart Guide appears when the footer menu is 
aligned center with the page.
Like most design applications, Muse content has a stacking order on the page. This 
means that all of the content you add to your page is stacked one object on another, 
with the first object you create on the page being on the bottom of that stack. You 
can easily change the stacking order of content using menu commands.
about arranging objects
As you add more content to the page, you may need to send content behind or 
bring it in front of other content.
• 
To move an object to the top or bottom position on the page, select the object 
you want to move and choose Object > Bring To Front or Object > Send To Back.
• 
To move an object one step to the front or one to the back of a stack of objects, 
select the object you want to move, and choose Object > Bring Forward or 
Object > Send Backward.
applying a background image to a frame
Text frames, image frames, and any empty frame you draw can all have background 
images applied to them to add to your designs. Background images in objects like 
these work just like the background image for the page area and the browser fill, 
showing behind the content in the frame and adding more design possibilities.
Next, you’ll add a repeating triangle element to the footer.
1 Select the Rectangle tool, and draw a small rectangle in the middle of the footer 
area, below the menu bar.
2 Press Ctrl+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) several times to zoom into 
the frame.
3 In the Transform panel change Height to 16.

126 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
4 Select the Selection tool, and drag the  
rectangle from its center so that the left 
edge of the frame snaps to the left edge of 
the browser width and the bottom of the 
rectangle snaps to the top of the previous 
rectangle.
5 Click the Fill link in the Control panel and change the color to [None]. Click 
the Choose Background Image folder icon (
) to select a background image. 
Navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder, choose footer-zag.png, and 
click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
The brown triangle will appear in the frame. You inserted this image into the 
background so that you could repeat it easily in the frame, instead of placing that 
single image and pasting it numerous times.
6 Choose Tile Horizontally from the  
Fitting menu, and make sure that the 
lower-left point in the position indica-
tor (
) is selected. Click anywhere else 
on the page to close the Fill menu.
The brown triangle should now be 
repeating horizontally in the rectangle. 
The height of the frame also matches 
the height of the image for no other 
reason except to keep things neat.
7 Choose View > Fit Page In Window, 
then press Ctrl+- (Windows) or 
Command+- (Mac OS) several times 
until you see the edges of the page 
width.
8 Click and drag the right-middle 
bounding point of the frame to the right 
until it snaps to the edge of the browser width (until the red guide temporarily 
appears, indicating that the rectangle is set to display at 100% width).
This will make the new frame 100% the width of the browser window as well as 
filled with repeating brown triangles. Don’t worry about the black stroke around 
the frame; you will remove it later on page 136.
P Note: You can 
insert .jpg .gif, .png, or 
.psd files in Muse as a 
background image. As 
you’ll learn in Lesson 
6, “Adding Images 
to Your Site,” Muse 
automatically converts 
.psd files to a more 
compact format for the 
Web when you publish 
the site.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 127
Creating a line
You can create a line in Muse by applying a stroke to a very thin rectangle or other 
shapes. The trick is to give the rectangle a really small height for a horizontal line or 
width to create a vertical line. In this next section, you’ll add lines to the text on the 
preparation page in your site to help divide the content up visually. Lines can also 
be a great way to separate sidebars and other page areas from each other.
1 Click the Plan mode link to see the site map. Double-click the Preparation page 
thumbnail to open the page in Design mode. Make sure that you can see the top 
content on the page.
2 Select the Rectangle tool.  
Near the top of the page, but 
below the text “For visual 
examples roll over the 
numbers below,” click and 
drag from the left edge of 
that column to create a frame 
that has a width of the 
column and a height of 10px.
3 In the Transform panel, change Height to 1. This will make the frame a single 
pixel tall.
4 Click the Fill color (
) in the Control panel, and click one of the gray color 
swatches in the Color Picker panel that appears.
5 Change Stroke Weight in the Control panel to 0, since drawn frames have a 
1-pixel stroke (border) by default.
Later on page 135, you will learn all about working with strokes on objects.

128 
Lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
6 With the Selection tool and the  
rectangle selected, press the down 
arrow key a few times to move the 
rectangle down on the page.
Pressing an arrow key once 
nudges the rectangle by 1 
pixel. Try to visually center 
the rectangle between the two 
paragraphs of text.
Creating a dotted line
Creating a dotted line combines two skills you’ve already learned: creating a line 
from a rectangle and inserting a background image into that rectangle to simulate 
the repeating dot in the dotted line.
1 On the Preparation page, select the Rectangle tool and create a rectangle at the 
top of the first column of the page that is the width of the first column and has a 
height of 20 pixels.
2 Click the Fill link in the Control panel and change the color to [None]. Click the 
Choose Background Image folder icon to select a background image. Navigate 
to the images folder in the Lessons folder, choose tile-dash.png, and click Select.
3 Choose Tile Horizon tally from  
the Fitting menu, and make sure that 
the upper-left point in the position 
indicator (
) is selected.
Created in Adobe Photo shop, the 
background image has a width of 5 
pixels and a height of 2 pixels, and 
it contains a rectangle shape. It is 
repeating in the background to give 
the appearance of a dashed line. If you look in the frame on the page, you can see 
the image repeat.
E Tip: Pressing the 
Shift key while pressing 
an arrow key moves the 
object 10 pixels each 
time.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 129
4 Press the Escape key to hide the Fill options.
5 Change Stroke Weight in the Control panel to 0.
6 In the Transform panel, change Height to 2, since the image is 2 pixels tall and 
the rectangle doesn’t need to be any taller.
7 Select the Selection tool, and choose Edit > Cut.
8 Select the Text tool, and insert the 
cursor below the paragraph that 
starts with “Gather 4 tablespoons of 
coffee beans.” Choose Edit > Paste.
You can paste content like a frame 
or image into a text frame. This is 
called inline content. The advantage 
of pasting content into a text frame, 
instead of just placing it on top of 
the text frame, is that if the text size grows or shrinks in the browser or the frame 
moves, the inline content will move as well.
9 Select the Selection tool and with the dotted frame still selected, press the down 
arrow key on your keyboard to move the rectangle down.
When you press the arrow key, notice that the Y value in the Transform panel 
changes. You could also move the rectangle up or down by changing the Y 
value. The X value is dimmed, meaning you can’t edit it because the shape is 
inline and can’t go outside of the edges of the text frame that it’s in.
10 Select the Text tool, insert the cursor 
between every two paragraphs below, 
and then choose Edit > Paste. You 
may need to scroll down the page.
Stop after you paste the rectangle 
between the last two paragraphs in 
the text frame; you don’t need to 
continue into the next text frame.
If you need to adjust the Y position 
of any of the inline rectangles, you 
can click each rectangle frame one 
at a time with the Selection tool and press the arrow keys or change the Y value 
in the Transform panel. Although the position of the pasted frames may not be 
exactly the same in every browser, it will be very close. That is the nature of the 
Web, not Muse.
P Note: You can also 
click away from the Fill 
options to hide them.
P Note: Selecting 
the inline rectangles 
you pasted may be 
a little challenging 
because they are very 
thin. Zooming in can 
help. The Smart Guides 
do show a highlight 
when you position the 
pointer over an object, 
indicating what would 
be selected if you were 
to click (View > Smart 
Guides).

11 Click the Preview mode link to preview the page and see your changes. Click 
the Design mode link to return to the Preparation page in Design mode.
12 Choose File > Save Site, then choose Edit > Deselect All.
Leave the Preparation page showing in Design mode. In the next section, you are 
going to begin to explore creating and editing color in more detail.
Working with color
Unlike print designs, which can use CMYK colors, Pantone color, or other color 
libraries, designs for the Web use only the RGB color model. All colors and images 
that you create must be in the RGB color mode. The good news is that when you 
save an image in .jpg, .gif, .png, or other web format using File > Save for Web & 
Devices (or File > Save For Web in CS6), Photoshop converts the colors to RGB 
mode automatically.
Web-safe colors
Ever heard of “web-safe” colors? Back when computers supported a maximum 
of 256 different colors, a list of 216 web-safe colors was created to ensure that all 
computers could display the colors correctly. That meant that you could design with 
only those 216 colors, to play it safe.
Today, web-safe colors are no longer necessary because most computers and 
devices can display millions of different colors.
In Muse, you can describe a color with individual red, green, and blue (R, G, and 
B) values or a single, six-character hexadecimal (hex for short) value. R, G, and B 
values range from 0 to 255. The values in a hex color value range from 0 to 9 and 
A to F. For example, the hex value AE1365 describes the same color as R: 174, 
G: 19, B: 101. The first two characters (AE) correlate to the red value (174), the sec-
ond pair (13) to the green (19), and the third pair (65) to the blue (101).
Both the hex and RGB values tell the browser which color to display, in this case a 
dark magenta shade. You can think of RGB and hex values as two different numeric 
languages you can use to describe the same color; just like whether you say red or 
rojo, you’re still describing the color of ketchup. Using either system of values you 
easily can transfer colors into Muse that you created in another application, such 
as Photoshop. Of course, in Muse, you also can simply create colors by eye using 
the Color Picker panel. Whichever method you use to specify a color, you can apply 
that color to a stroke and fill of a frame.

• RGB values: Specifies the values of the red, green, and blue channels of a color. 
Values range from 0 to 255.
• Current Color: Displays the color currently selected and described by the RGB 
and hex values.
• Hex (hexadecimal) value: Specifies the hexadecimal (or hex for short) value of 
the current color.
• Eyedropper tool: Enables you to select colors used on a page or in placed 
images; click the eyedropper on the desired color to sample it.
• Color swatches: Saved colors that you can apply, create, or delete in your site.
• Color slider: Enables you to select the hue or color to start from. You can then 
adjust the color’s saturation and brightness in the Color Field.
• Color Field: Enables you to adjust the saturation and brightness of a color by 
dragging the circle. Saturation is shown horizontally and Brightness is shown 
vertically. Saturation, from left to right is less to more saturated, and Brightness 
from top to bottom is brighter to darker.
• Create new swatch: Saves a selected color in the list of color swatches.
• Delete: Deletes a selected color swatch in the list of color swatches.
For the remainder of the lesson, you’ll experiment with color, learning how to 
create colors, apply them, and save them as swatches. You’ll also work with color 
gradients to add some flair to your design.
Creating and applying a color fill
Muse offers many color options that help you easily create and save colors to reuse 
throughout your site. One of the most common applications is a color fill, which 
is color that appears inside of a shape or frame. To practice, you will create a color 
for a sidebar rectangle and then save that color so you can use it later. Before you 
begin, make sure the Preparation page is open in Design mode.
P Note: The colors you 
see in the Color Picker 
in the figure are the 
default colors, which 
are added automatically 
when you inserted the 
menu widget.

132 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
1 Select the Rectangle tool in the Toolbox. On the Preparation page, create a 
rectangle at the top of the first column on the left. Give it a height of 150px and 
the same width as the column (270px).
2 Click the Fill color option (
) in the Control panel to show the Color Picker 
panel.
3 In the Color Picker panel, change the RGB values to R: 153, G: 204, and B: 204.
Notice the Hex value changes to 99CCCC.
4 In the Color Field, drag the circle, indicating the selected color, up a little to 
increase the brightness of the color.
5 Press Escape to hide the Color Picker panel.
P Note: You can also click away from the Color Picker panel to hide it.
P Note: If you want 
to match the exact 
color in the figure, you 
can change the RGB 
values to R: 165, G: 231, 
and B: 231. Editing the 
hue, saturation, and 
brightness will change 
the RGB color values of 
the selected color.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 133
6 Change Stroke Weight in the Control panel to 0.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
sampling color
Sampling color is a great way to either reuse a color that wasn’t saved or create a 
new color from a color in an image on the page. To change the large white rectangle 
in the footer to match the rectangle with the repeating triangle background, you will 
sample the brown color from the triangle image.
1 Click the A-Master page tab to see the master page in Design mode.
2 With the Selection tool, click to select the first, large white rectangle you created 
in the footer.
3 Click the Fill color (
) in the Control panel to show the Color Picker panel.
4 In the Color Picker panel, click the Eyedropper tool (
).
5 Position the Eyedropper pointer over one of the brown triangles in the footer 
rectangle. When that brown color appears in the Current Color in the Color 
Picker panel, click to sample the color and leave the Color Picker panel open.
When you click Fill color in the Control panel, sampling with the Eyedropper 
tool automatically applies sampled color to the fill of a selected frame. If you 
didn’t have content selected, the color would apply to the background of the 
page area.
With a color created, you can now save the color as a swatch that you can later apply 
to the fill or stroke of selected content in this site only.
P Note: To ensure that 
you sampled the correct 
brown color, check the 
RGB color values and 
change them, if needed, 
to R: 90, G: 41, and B: 33.

134 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
saving and editing a swatch
Although you don’t have to save the colors you create as swatches, saving a color 
can make your life easier later on if you want to reuse color or if you decide to use a 
consistent set of colors throughout your site. You can find saved swatches by click-
ing the Fill or Stroke colors in the Control panel or in the Swatches panel.
1 With the brown color still showing in the Color Picker panel, click the Create 
New Swatch button (
) at the bottom of the Color Picker panel.
Creating a new swatch saves the current color into the swatch list at the end.
2 Position the pointer over the new swatch; a yellow tooltip appears showing the 
RGB color values of the new swatch.
By default, the tooltip displays the RGB color values, but you can change that 
via the Swatch Options settings. Many designers prefer the tooltips to indicate 
what a color is to be used for, such as a heading color, for instance.
3 Double-click the new brown swatch to open the Swatch Options dialog box.
4 Deselect Name With Color 
Value to add your own 
name. Change the Swatch 
name to FooterBG.
Adding the BG (back-
ground) to the color name 
is useful for later when 
you are trying to figure out 
where you used this color. 
Also notice that the Swatch 
Options dialog box shows 
the entire Color Picker set 
of options for editing the brown color or sampling another color.
5 Click OK.
P Note: Any changes 
that you make in the 
Swatch Options dialog 
box change the swatch 
as well as every object 
in your site to which 
you applied the color.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 135
6 Position the pointer  
over the brown 
color swatch in the 
Color Picker to see 
the tooltip display 
FooterBG.
7 Press the Escape key 
to close the Color 
Picker panel, and 
choose File > Save 
Site. Leave the brown-filled rectangle selected for the next section.
You can create and save as many colors as you need. Just remember that you don’t 
have to save a color, but doing so can be very helpful, saving you time later on.
Creating and editing a color stroke
As in most other Adobe applications, color strokes, or borders, are very effec-
tive tools in Muse, much like fills. As you remember, Muse applies black, 1-pixel 
strokes to frames by default. You’ve already learned the basics of changing a stroke’s 
weight, so this exercise focuses on customizing a stroke’s color and saving that 
color as a swatch. You’ll also tour the Stroke Options panel, which gives you even 
more control over a stroke’s appearance.
1 In the Control panel, change the Stroke Weight to 10 to apply a 10-pixel stroke.
2 Click the Stroke color (
) in the Control panel to reveal the stroke Color 
Picker panel. Click the FooterBG color swatch to apply it to the stroke.
The stroke Color Picker panel is identical to the fill Color Picker panel you 
worked with in the previous few sections.
3 In the Color Field, drag 
the circle, indicating the 
selected color, up and 
to the left to make the 
brightness of the brown 
color brighter.
4 Click the Create New 
Swatch button (
) to 
save the color. Press 
Escape to hide the 
stroke Color Picker 
panel. 
P Note: It’s okay if the 
color you wind up with 
doesn’t match the color 
in the example.

136 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
5 Click the Stroke link in the Control panel.
The Stroke Options panel that appears shows two main options: Stroke 
Alignment and Individual Stroke Weights. Stroke Alignment lets you align the 
stroke to the inside, outside, and the center of the edge of a frame. The Stroke 
Weight options allow you to change the stroke weight for each side of a frame 
independently, if you want.
6 Click the Align Stroke To 
Inside button (
) and notice 
that the lighter brown stroke 
on the rectangle is now inside 
of the edges of the rectangle.
7 Change the Top Stroke 
Weight value to 0 and press 
Enter or Return.
All of the stroke weights will 
change because the Make 
All Settings The Same icon is 
selected ( ).
8 Click the Make All Settings  
The Same icon off so that  
it looks like this (
). Now you 
can edit each of the Stroke 
Weight settings indepen-
dently. Change the Top Stroke 
Weight to 15 and press Enter 
or Return. Press Escape to 
hide the Stroke Options panel, 
and leave the rectangle 
selected.
The same lighter brown stroke 
color should be applied to the 
stroke that now appears on only the top edge of the rectangle.
9 With the Selection tool, click the frame with the brown triangle background in 
the footer. Change the Stroke Weight in the Control panel to 0.
10 Click the Preview mode link, and preview the page to see your changes. Click 
the Design mode link to return to the A-Master page in Design mode.

Duplicating and deleting a color swatch
Another place where you can create and edit color is the Swatches panel (Window > 
Swatches). The Swatches panel has a few more options than the Color Picker in the 
Control panel, and enables you to duplicate and delete colors.
1 Click the Swatches panel tab on the right side of the workspace to reveal the 
panel.
2 Click the triangle to the left of the text “Color Picker” in the Swatches panel 
several times to reveal and hide the Color Picker options.
You won’t always need them, and hiding these makes seeing content in other 
panels easier. Make sure that the Color Picker options are showing before 
moving on.
3 Position the pointer over the FooterBG color  
swatch, in the top portion of the Swatches panel, 
right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) 
and choose Duplicate Swatch from the context 
menu that appears.
This creates an exact copy of the color and inserts 
the new color swatch at the end of the swatch list.
4 Position the pointer over the new swatch named 
FooterBG copy. Right-click (Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS), and choose Swatch Options from 
the context menu that appears.
5 Change the name to 
Footer Stroke and change 
the RGB values to R: 67, 
G: 30, B: 24 in the Swatch 
Options dialog box. 
Click OK.
Now that you’ve 
duplicated a swatch and 
made changes to it, you 
will delete a swatch. 
6 Position the pointer over the lighter brown swatch you made in the previous 
section. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS), and choose Delete 
Swatch from the context menu that appears.
P Note: Make sure 
that you don’t double-
click to edit the swatch. 
Although you can 
double-click a swatch 
to edit its properties, 
doing so will apply to 
the fill of whatever is 
selected on the page or, 
if nothing is selected, 
the fill will apply to the 
entire page area.

138 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
7 Select Defined Swatch,  
and choose the Footer 
Stroke color from the 
menu in the Delete 
Swatch dialog box.
The Delete Swatch dialog 
box will appear only if the 
swatch you are deleting 
has been applied to content in your site. You can choose to replace the swatch 
with a defined swatch (a swatch you’ve saved previously) or an unnamed swatch. 
Choosing Unnamed Swatch deletes the swatch in the panel, but leaves the color 
applied to your content in the site. Click OK.
8 Choose File > Save Site.
9 Click the Preview mode link to see the changes in Preview mode. Click the 
Design mode link to return to the page in Design mode and leave the rectangle 
selected.
Working with gradients
You can also apply a color fill using a gradient, which is a blend from one color to 
another. Muse offers lots of options to help you make and apply gradients to the fill 
of all types of frames.
To add some depth to the footer rectangle, you’ll fill it with a gradient.
1 With the Selection tool, click to select the large, brown rectangle in the footer, 
and then click the Fill panel tab to show the panel on the right side of the 
workspace.
The Fill panel shows the same options as clicking the Fill link in the Control 
panel, but because it’s a panel, you can leave it showing all the time. You can 
create and edit gradients by clicking the Fill color in the Control panel as well.
2 Select Gradient in the Fill panel, and notice that the  
Fill panel options change.
For example, you can now specify two colors, rather 
than one for a solid fill. The gradient you’re creating 
will eventually blend between the FooterBG color and 
the Footer Stroke color. By default, when you select 
Gradient, Muse applies the fill color of the selected 
object and black as the two colors that the gradient 
blends between.
E Tip: By right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-
clicking (Mac OS) in 
the swatch area of the 
Swatches panel, you 
can choose Delete All 
Unused in the context 
menu that appears. This 
is a great way to clean 
up your swatches and 
get rid of those that 
you are not using in 
your site. Note that it 
deletes them right away, 
whereas most other 
Adobe applications 
select the swatches to 
be deleted and allows 
you to then delete 
them yourself.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 139
3 Click the second Color option to select a new color. From the Color Picker, click 
to select the swatch named Red (to the right of the black color in the top row of 
the swatches).
Later, you will change the red color to something more subtle, but for now red 
will help you to see the effect that the settings will have on the gradient.
4 Change the second  
opacity option from the left, 
for the Red color, to 50.
This adjusts the opacity to 
50% for the Red color in the 
gradient, making it partially 
transparent or see-through.
5 Change the opacity back 
to 100.
6 Select Vertical to change the 
Direction of the gradient.
This changes the direction of 
the gradient to top to bottom 
rather than side to side.
7 Click the arrow to the right of the Focal Point field and drag the slider left and 
right to see the effect on the gradient in the footer rectangle. Make sure that the 
value is 80 before moving on to the next step.
The Focal Point is where the transition between the colors occurs in the shape. 
For a vertical gradient, the closer the value to 0, the closer to the top of the 
shape the transition appears.
E Tip: In the Color 
Picker, you can easily 
create and even save 
a new color while 
creating a gradient.

140 
lesson 5 Working with shapes and Color
8 Select Fixed for the Size. Change  
the value to the right of the 
selection to 50 by selecting the 
value and typing 50. Notice that 
the distance or blend between the 
two colors is much shorter. Try 
other values to see the effect. Make 
sure to select Automatic when 
you’re ready to move on.
With the Automatic size option 
enabled, the Size setting of 
a gradient is automatically 
determined by the size of the object. By default, Muse sets each of the colors on 
opposite ends of the color fill to create a blend that stretches the width or height 
of the object, depending on the Direction setting you select. If you select Fixed, 
you can change the size or length of the gradient to achieve the desired effect.
9 Click the second Color option  
from the left (with Red applied), 
and select the Footer Stroke color 
swatch from the Color Picker.
10 Press the Escape key to hide the 
Fill color options.
With the master content finished, 
that same content needs to be 
updated on the MasterFlash mas-
ter page as well.
11 With the Selection tool, drag a 
selection marquee across the content in the footer to select it. Choose Edit > Copy.
12 Click the Plan mode link and double-click the MasterFlash page thumbnail to 
open the page in Design mode.
13 With the Selection tool, drag a selection marquee to select the existing menu 
widget in the footer and press Backspace or Delete to remove it.
14 Choose Edit > Paste In Place.
15 Choose File > Save Site, and close all open pages.
Now that you’ve explored the world of Muse color and shape creation, in the 
next lesson, “Adding Images To Your Site,” you’ll learn all about image types, 
placing images, copying and pasting content, and more. Leave the site file 
named KevinsKoffeeKart.muse open to be ready.

1 Muse currently offers the Rectangle tool. With this tool, you can create squares, 
rectangles, lines, circles, and more.
2 100% width content is content that stretches to fit the width of the browser window no 
matter how narrow or wide it is. You can apply the 100% width characteristics to a text 
frame or a frame you drew with the Rectangle tool.
3 You can sample color from almost any content, including frames that contain color, 
images, text, or background images.
4 Hexadecimal values, such as 330011, are one way that you can tell a browser exactly 
which RGB color you wish to use.
5 If the swatch you are deleting has been applied to content in your site, the Delete 
Swatch dialog box will appear. You can choose to replace the swatch with a defined 
swatch (a swatch you’ve saved previously) or an unnamed swatch. Choosing Unnamed 
Swatch deletes the swatch in the panel, but leaves the color applied to your content in 
the site.
6 You can create gradients by clicking the Fill link in the Control panel or in the Fill

Muse allows you to place images you create and paste 
image content from other applications, such as Adobe 
Illustrator, Photoshop, and Fireworks. As you’ll see 
throughout this lesson, images can be easily moved, 
scaled, rotated, pinned, and more to match your 
design concept.

144 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
Web-image basics
Images can enhance a website’s visual interest, identity, and attitude. You simply need 
to choose the right image for the task. As you’ll see, the key to the effective use of 
images is finding a balance of size and color to achieve the desired optimal quality. 
Whether you receive images from others or create your own in a program like Adobe 
Illustrator or Photoshop, you need to keep these considerations in mind. For exam-
ple, although you can save images in a multitude of file formats, Muse allows you to 
place only .gif, .jpg, .png, and native Photoshop (.psd) files on your pages. In addition, 
Muse automatically converts placed Photoshop files (.psd) to .gif, .jpg, or .png files, 
because these formats are optimized for use on the Web and compatible with most 
browsers. Each format, however, has different capabilities and strengths. To under-
stand which is best for your site design, take a closer look at some key factors.
resolution
The resolution for images on the Web is 72ppi (pixels per inch). If you are used to 
working in print, then you are most likely used to 300ppi or something similar. The 
same resolutions that produce crisp images in print produce sluggish downloads on 
the Web where pixel loads add up fast. The 72ppi standard is a good compromise 
between image quality and file size. When you create your own images, make sure 
that you set the units to pixels and the resolution to 72ppi.
Color
When you create images in another application for later use in your website, do so 
in RGB color mode, which is the standard for monitors and other display devices. 
Print work, on the other hand, typically uses CMYK color mode. RGB images are 
smaller than CMYK in most cases, because they contain only three channels of color 
information (red, green, and blue) instead of four (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). 
Again, smaller files mean a more efficient site and a better experience for visitors.
Image formats
When you create content for your site in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, 
or other programs, you will save most of that content in one of the three web-image 
formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG. The more you know about each format, the more easily 
you can decide which to use for what type of image.
GIf
Graphic Interchange Format, 
or GIF, was designed 
specifically for the Web. These 
files, which have the extension 

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 145
.gif, are most useful for interface elements, buttons, graphical borders, and the like. 
When considering whether to use this format, remember that .gif files
• Support a maximum of 256 colors (8-bit palette)
• Use lossless compression (image data compression where no data is lost)
• Use a color space called Index
• Support index transparency, meaning you could use a program like Photoshop, 
for instance, to designate a background color behind a logo as transparent
• Support animation, meaning you could make an animated banner
JPeG
Named after the group that created the 
standard, the JPEG (Joint Photographic 
Experts Group) format is primarily 
intended for photo-quality images 
and uses the suffix .jpg. Most design-
ers use .jpg files for images that must 
be displayed in higher quality on their 
websites. When considering whether to use this format, remember that .jpg files
• Support 16 million colors (24-bit color)
• Can be used for print and Web work because the format supports both the 
CMYK and RGB color spaces
• Use lossy compression, meaning that a .jpg file loses quality every time you save 
it, making a trade-off between image quality and file size
• Can compress image data greatly by discarding adjacent pixels of duplicate color, 
but too much compression can result in block-like “artifacts” that look unnatural.
PnG
Pronounced ping, the PNG, or Portable Network Graphic, for-
mat combines many features of .gif and .jpg files and then adds a 
few of its own into .png files. The format was originally designed 
to surpass the limitations of .gif files, and most designers now 
prefer it for images that require transparency, drop shadows, and the like. When 
considering whether to use this format, remember that .png files
• Support millions of colors (for RGB color, up to 48-bit color)
• Support alpha transparency (a drop shadow) and index transparency (a back-
ground color)
• Use lossless compression, meaning you do not lose any quality each time you 
save the .png file
• Include some features, such as alpha transparency, that are not fully supported 
in Internet Explorer 6 and other older browsers
P Note: If you save an 
image for your site as 
a .jpg file in an image 
editing program, ensure 
that it is in the RGB 
color space not CMYK. 
In Photoshop and 
Illustrator, if you save an 
image as .jpg using the 
File > Save For Web & 
Devices command 
(File > Save For Web 
in CS6), the image is 
automatically converted 
to the RGB color mode.

146 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
Also keep in mind that Photoshop and Illustrator offer two versions of .png: 8 bit, 
which uses 8 bits of color or fewer per pixel, and 24 bit, which uses 24 bits of color 
per pixel.
Importing images
Muse offers several methods for getting images into your web designs, including 
placing and pasting. Placing an image into your Muse site using the Place com-
mand (File > Place) creates a link to the image file, which means that if you later 
update the image file, the instances of that file will be updated in Muse as well. 
Pasting image content into your pages embeds that content into the site, meaning 
changes to the original image file will not update the embedded image in Muse. To 
learn more about pasting content into Muse see the sidebar titled, “Copy and paste 
image content into Muse” on page 148.
Images in Muse, like text, live in rectangular frames, and are referred to as frames. 
The frame that contains an image can have a stroke, fill, or other formatting or 
transformations applied to it. Images that do not have transparency cover the fill 
color or background image, unless you make the frame larger than the image or 
make the image smaller than the frame (you’ll learn how to do this on page 150).
If you move the frame on the page, the image moves as well. You can resize the 
frame and image together or separately to create some interesting effects. Unlike in 
Adobe InDesign, you cannot draw a rectangle first with the Rectangle tool and place 
the image inside that rectangle in Muse. However, you can use the Fill menu to add 
background images (tiled or not) as fills of a rectangle, image frame, or text frame.
Before you jump into placing images, gather your images into the same folder as 
your Muse site file to keep things neat. Often, designers create a dedicated sub-
folder named Images. You can place images (File > Place) from other locations, as 
well. As long as Muse can find the image files when you publish, Muse will collect 
copies into one folder when you publish or export the site.
about linked files
When you place images in Muse, you actually create a link from the page to the 
image. If you place a .gif, .jpg, or .png image, Muse links to the original image, wher-
ever it lives, and collects all linked files into a single folder when the time comes to 
publish.
If you place a Photoshop document (.psd), Muse converts the file to the web format 
that best fits the content. As you work on the site, Muse preserves the link to the 
original .psd, and you can make any changes necessary in it, then update the image 
in Muse using the Assets panel (Window > Assets).
P Note: To learn 
more about web image 
best practices, see the 
“Web_images.pdf” file 
in the Lesson06 folder.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons

P Note: For more 
information on adding 
strokes, fills, and 
background images to 
frames, see Lesson 5, 
“Working with Shapes 
and Colors.”

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 147
Placing an image
Whether you need to add interest to your pages selling products, call attention to a 
promotion, or showcase your latest employee of the month, images can help. In this 
exercise, you’ll use the Place command (File > Place) to insert a JPEG image of the 
Koffee Kart’s founder on the site’s ABOUT page.
P Note: The exercises in this chapter, like others in this book, require that you have the fonts sup-
plied on the Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book disc installed on your machine. For more information 
on installing the necessary fonts, see “Fonts used in this book” on page 2 of “Getting Started.”
1 With the KevinsKoffeeKart site open and in Plan mode, double-click the 
ABOUT page to open it in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder 
in the Lessons folder. Select the image named MeetKevin.jpg, and click Open 
(Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
Move the pointer onto the page, and you now see the Place Gun with a handy 
thumbnail preview of the image that you are about to place. Remember, the 
upper-left corner of the image will align with the upper-left corner of the Place 
Gun when you click on the page to place the image.
4 Near the top of the third column, click 
and drag to place the image. Make the 
frame the width of the third column. Its 
vertical position in the column doesn’t 
matter right now.
Notice that as you drag, you are sizing 
the image with the frame and an image 
thumbnail appears next to the pointer.
5 Choose Edit > Undo Place to remove the 
image from the page and reattach it to 
the Place Gun.
6 Position the pointer on the left edge of 
the third column toward the top. Click to 
place the image. Don’t worry if it ends up 
on top of the rotated text caption from 
last lesson; you’ll fix it later.
By simply clicking when placing, you 
create an image frame the same size as 
the image and place the image in the 
frame at 100% its original size.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
P Note: If you are 
starting from scratch 
in this lesson, use the 
method described in 
the “Jumpstart” section 
on page 5 of “Getting 
Started.”
E Tip: To remove the 
selected image from 
the Place Gun and turn 
the pointer back into 
the Selection arrow, 
press the Escape key.
P Note: In Muse, it’s 
best to place images at 
100% of their original 
size. When you enlarge 
an image, it can grow 
jagged on the edges 
and blurry, depending 
on the original resolu-
tion of the image. You 
are also adding to the 
file size of the images 
that are downloaded 
when visitors view 
the page.

lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
Copy and paste image  
content into Muse
If you want to copy and paste graphic content into a page in Muse from within the 
same site, from site to site, or from another program, consider a few things first:
•
If you copy an image you placed on one page of your site and paste it to another 
page, the newly pasted image and the placed image both will link to the original 
image file on your hard drive. Changes to the original source file will change the 
copies on both pages.
•
If you copy an image you placed on one site and paste it into another site, the 
placed image and pasted image both will link to the original image file saved 
in the original site’s folder. Changes to the original source file will change the 
copies on both sites.
•
If you copy and paste an image from Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, 
or other program, Muse flattens the image content, removing any transparency 
and layer information, and embeds the image in the site. The pasted image does 
not link to an image file outside of Muse.
•
You can paste a single slice of a Photoshop image into Muse. In Photoshop, 
create a slice with the Slice tool, select the slice, and choose Edit > Copy. In 
Muse, choose Edit > Paste to paste that content into your page; the resulting 
flattened image will contain all of the currently visible content in the 
Photoshop file.
•
Pasted content is pasted at 100% of its original size and becomes a web image 
when you preview, publish, or export the site.
Placing a Photoshop file (.psd)
Placing a Photoshop file (.psd) in Muse comes with the same linking and updating 
benefits as placing a .jpg, .gif, or .png file, plus a few extras. If the Photoshop file 
has content in more than one layer, for example, and you place it in your site via 
File > Place, Muse gives you the choice of placing the composite image (all layers) 
or selected layers. This means that, for instance, you can create a complete page 
design in Photoshop with page-specific content on individual layers, then place 
only the layer you need for each page. Alternately, you could create multiple ver-
sions of a button or logo on separate layers, for instance, and place the version you 
like best.
When you publish or export the site, Muse converts the Photoshop content to 
a suitable format for the Web but does not publish or export the original .psd 
file. Don’t let your imagination run too far, though, as for all other images that 
you place, you still need to consider file size, resolution, and color when creating 
Photoshop content.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 149
To see how the Photoshop-specific options work, try placing a .psd file on the 
home page.
1 If you’re still in Design mode, click the Plan mode link to access the page 
thumbnails. If you’re already in Plan mode, simply double-click the HOME page 
thumbnail to open the home page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Toolbox, and click twice on the upper-left 
corner of the page area below the header to zoom in.
4 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder in 
the Lessons folder, then the image named DailyDrip.psd. Click Open (Windows) 
or Select (Mac OS).
The Image Import Options (DailyDrip.psd) dialog opens. You can instruct Muse 
to place the composite image with all of the layers showing or only selected 
layers. Choose carefully: If you later want to turn on or off layers in the .psd in 
Muse, you must place the file again or relink it (more on that on page 160).
E Tip: You can place multiple images at once by selecting those images in the Import dialog box. 
When you click Open or Select, Muse shows the Place Gun with a number off the right edge of the 
image thumbnail indicating how many images are loaded in the Place Gun. You can press the right 
and left arrow keys to cycle between the images, stopping when you see the thumbnail of the 
image you are ready to place. You can then click to place each image. If you come to a thumbnail for 
an image in the Place Gun that you don’t want to place, press the Escape key to remove it from the 
Place Gun.
5 Select Import Layer. Make 
sure that the banner text 
layer is selected. Select 
Clip To Layer Contents, 
and click OK.
Suppose that you designed 
the entire web page in 
Photoshop, and you wanted 
to place a logo from one 
of the layers in the .psd 
into Muse. The logo is only 
a small part of the larger 
design. Selecting Clip To Layer Contents crops the placed image to the size 
of the selected layer content instead of making it the size of the entire design. 
The original .psd file remains unchanged. You can also select more than one 
layer in the Image Import Options dialog box if you select Import Layer. 
Simply Shift-click the layers or Ctrl (Windows)/Command (Mac OS) select 
noncontiguous layers and click OK.
P Note: Layer groups 
in a layered Photoshop 
file are ignored when 
placing that image in 
Muse. In other words, 
you will not see the 
layer groups in the 
Import Options dialog 
box, and Muse treats 
the file as if there 
were none.

150 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
6 Position the Place Gun on the left edge of  
the page area, even with the top margin 
guide and click to place the image.
P Note: After placing an image, Muse swaps to the 
Selection tool automatically, regardless of which tool 
was selected before. 
7 With the Selection tool, drag the image 
from its center to the left so that it hangs 
off the edge of the page area. See the 
figure for placement help.
8 Choose File > Save Site.
9 Click the Preview mode link to see the 
image, then click the Design mode link to 
return to the page.
10 Choose File > Close Page to return to the 
ABOUT page. 
Moving, cropping, and resizing images
Getting images into your site design is only the first step. Unless you hit perfection 
on the first try, you may need to adjust the image’s placement, size, rotation, or 
cropping. Using several tools and methods, you can transform only the rectangular 
frame of the image, only the image independently of the frame, or both frame and 
image together.
transforming images with the selection tool
You’ll first focus on exploring image transformation using the Selection tool, which 
offers a lot of fast, powerful transformations without having to switch tools.
1 With the ABOUT page open in Design mode, click to select the MeetKevin.jpg 
image with the Selection tool.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 151
2 Drag the image from its center until the  
top of the image is aligned with the top 
of the text that begins “Koffee Kart 
began as…”
A Smart Guide will appear across 
the top of the text and image when 
they are aligned. You will also see the 
aqua gap measurements showing 20px. 
The gap measurements show if another 
pair of objects has the same gap size—in 
this case it’s the gap between all three columns. Make sure that the left edge of 
the image is still aligned with the left edge of the third column.
3 Click and drag the bottom-right point on 
the image frame down and to the right 
until the measurement label shows 120%.
With the Selection tool, if you drag a point 
on the frame to resize it, you also resize 
the image. 
about resizing and cropping in Muse
The best practice for Web images is to place them at 100% without resizing in Muse. 
Figure out the size needed from your design, and adjust the image accordingly 
beforehand in an image-editing program like Photoshop.
If you must resize an image in Muse, know that resizing can make the image appear 
jaggy or blurry. If you place a .jpg, .gif, or .png file and resize it, the original image file 
remains unchanged, however. When you publish or export the site, Muse transforms 
a copy of that image.
In Muse, when you size an image larger than 
100%, a warning icon appears in the Assets 
panel (Window > Assets). This warning icon 
indicates that you may need to link to a 
larger version of the image or scale the image 
down.
Also, when you open a site that contains 
at least one image that has been scaled 
larger than 100%, a dialog box appears.

152 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
4 Click and drag the bottom-right point on the image frame toward the center of 
the image until the measurement label shows 100%.
No matter how many times you resize an image, you can always get it back 
to 100%.
5 With the image selected, press and hold 
the Control (Windows) or Command 
(Mac OS) key, and drag the bottom-
middle bounding point of the frame up 
to the bottom of Kevin’s wrist in the 
image.
Rather than resize the frame and image 
together, dragging while pressing 
Control (Command) lets you resize 
the frame only. In this case, you are 
cropping a part of the image so that it 
no longer shows. You could also make the frame larger than the image if you 
wanted a background color or background image applied to the frame to show.
6 Double-click the image with the Selection tool.
Notice that the once blue rectangle with eight bounding points turns into a 
brown rectangle with smaller points. Also notice that the pointer has changed 
from a black arrow to a hand when the pointer is positioned over the image. The 
lighter area of the image at the bottom is the part of the image that was cropped 
by the previous step. These indicators will help you resize the image within the 
frame and reposition it.
7 Click and drag the image from the  
center straight down just a bit.
You’ll see that more of the bottom of the 
image looks lighter or semitransparent. 
By dragging an image after double-
clicking it with the Selection tool, you 
are moving the image in the frame; you 
are not editing the frame. There is also 
a gap between the top frame edge and 
the top of the image. This is where a fill 
color or background image you applied 
to the frame will show.
8 Position the pointer over the image, and you will see the blue rectangle and the 
edge of the image in brown. Choose Edit > Undo Move Item.
P Note: You could 
also choose Edit > 
Undo Resize Item to 
return this image to its 
previous size.
P Note: Cropping an 
image in Muse does 
not crop the original 
image file.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 153
9 Position the pointer over the bottom- 
right corner point of the image and the 
pointer changes to a double arrow. Drag 
down and to the right until the 
measurement label shows 140% to 
resize the image, not the frame.
Resizing an image this way 
automatically constrains the 
proportions of the image, not allowing 
you to distort it. 
10 Press the Escape key to select the blue 
rectangle again.
You can see that the image is cropped 
within the frame and is now larger than 
it was.
P Note: You can also click away from the image to 
deselect it, then click on it again to select the frame, 
not the image.
using the fitting commands
Another way to resize an image is to use the Fitting commands built into Muse. 
These commands allow you to fill a frame with an image or fit the image to the 
frame, while keeping the image in proportion.
1 Choose Object > Fitting > Fit Content Proportionally.
This command fits the entire image in the frame and centers it without 
cropping. Notice the gaps on the right and left of the image frame. Because the 
frame didn’t have the same proportions as the image, Muse left a gap between 
the frame and image on two sides.
2 Choose Object > Fitting > 
Fill Frame Proportionally.
This command ensures 
that the image fills the 
frame and is centered, 
with no gaps, but will 
crop a portion of the 
image if the proportions 
of the frame don’t match 
the image proportions.
E Tip: If you position 
the pointer just off any 
of the corner bounding 
points, you will see the 
rotate arrow.
E Tip: You can also 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
the rectangular image 
frame and choose a 
fitting command from 
the context menu that 
appears.

Adding images to Your site
using the Crop tool
Finally, you can crop or resize an image with the Crop tool. Found in the Toolbox, 
the Crop tool (
) enables you to move, resize, and crop an image and its frame 
together or separately, much like the Selection tool methods discussed previously.
	
Select the Crop tool in the Toolbox, and position the pointer over the image, 
away from the image center. Notice that the pointer changes from a crop 
icon (
) to an arrow ( ) and the Content Grabber appears in the center of the 
	
When you see the arrow pointer over the image, drag the image from anywhere 
	
Position the pointer over the bottom-middle point of the image frame and when 
the pointer changes to double arrows, drag the point down to see more of the 
image. Don’t go so far as to go beyond the image edge.
The Crop tool allows you to resize the frame without resizing the image.
	
Position the pointer over the Content Grabber in the center of the image. When 
the pointer changes to a hand, click and drag the image down to reveal more of 
the top of the image.
The Content Grabber is there to help you to select the image not the frame. The 
	
Click the Content Grabber in the center of the image to select the image, not 
the frame.
Reveal more of the image
Drag the image down
Select the image
You can tell that the image (not the frame) is selected when you see the brown 
rectangle around the image. With the image selected, you could drag the image 
and reposition it within the frame, resize, or rotate it.
	
Press the Escape key to select the blue rectangular image frame and leave the 
image selected.
P Note: To change the 
image with the Crop 
tool, you do not need 
to first select the image 
because you can select 
it with the Crop tool.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 155
8 With the image selected, choose Object > Fitting > Fill Frame Proportionally.
9 Choose File > Save Site.
Locking and grouping content
As you work, Muse lets you lock and unlock content to prevent you from inadver-
tently selecting and editing it. You can also combine several objects into a group 
so that the objects are treated as a single unit. You can then move or transform a 
number of objects without affecting their attributes or relative positions.
1 Select the Selection tool.
2 With the MeetKevin.jpg image still selected, choose Object > Lock.
You cannot select locked content, which can be useful when you need to work 
on other content around the image.
3 Click to select the caption text frame that contains the text “Photo by: Karen 
Koffee.”
4 Drag the text frame from its center to  
the right of the image so that you can 
see all of the text. Make the text frame 
fit tighter around the text by dragging 
the left, middle-bounding point to the 
left until the measurement label shows a 
height of approximately 20.
5 Drag the text frame from its center until 
the last letter “e” in Koffee is aligned 
with the bottom of the image frame, 
then release the mouse button. A 
horizontal Smart Guide will show when 
the two are aligned. Press and hold the 
Shift key, then drag the frame to the left. 
When the aqua gap measurements read 
20px, release the Shift key and then the 
mouse. Leave the text frame selected.
Pressing and holding the Shift key constrains the movement of content 
to 90 degrees.
6 Choose Object > Unlock All On Page.
P Note: The text frame 
may be underneath the 
image, making it hard 
to see and select. With 
the Selection tool, you 
can drag a selection 
marquee across the 
image and it will most 
likely select the text 
frame. Because the 
image is locked, it will 
not be selected.

156 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
7 Press and hold the Shift key and click to select the image. The text frame and 
image are now both selected.
The Shift key allows you to select multiple objects. If multiple objects are 
selected, holding the Shift key while clicking one of the objects allows you to 
deselect it.
8 Choose Object > Group to group the selected content.
A dotted box appears around the group. You now can move, rotate, and even 
resize the group of objects.
9 With the group still selected, click once more on the caption text frame to select 
only that frame.
P Note: To edit the objects within the group, you can also select the group and choose 
Object > Ungroup.
10 Press the left arrow key once to position the text frame one pixel closer to the 
image.
11 Press and hold the Shift key and press the left arrow once to position the text 
frame 10 pixels closer to the image.
12 Press the Escape key to select the entire group again.
13 Choose File > Save Site.
rotating images
You can rotate all types of content in Muse using several methods. When it comes to 
images, you can rotate the frame and image together or just the image in the frame.
1 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > 
Lesson06 > images folder. Select the image named OurFounder.png, and click 
Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
2 Click just above the MeetKevin.jpg image to place the banner image at 100%.
3 Click the Transform panel (Window > Transform) tab to show the panel.
E Tip: Another way to 
select multiple objects 
with the Selection tool 
is to drag a selection 
marquee across the 
objects on a page in 
Design mode.
P Note: Resizing a 
group resizes images, 
but does not change 
the size of text in the 
group.
E Tip: You can also 
edit the size or position 
of selected content in 
the Transform panel 
(Window > Transform).

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 157
4 Position the pointer off the lower-right bounding point. When you see the rotate 
arrow (
), click and drag clock wise. Watch the Rotation Angle in the Transform 
panel; when you see a value of 321, stop rotating.
Notice that the edges of the image look more jagged. The best practice in Muse 
is to rotate the image before placing it, but sometimes that can’t be helped.
5 With the Selection tool, drag the image  
into position on top of the image of the 
MeetKevin.jpg image. See the figure for 
placement help.
6 Click to select the image frame and text 
frame group. Choose Object > Ungroup.
7 Click away from the image and text 
frame to deselect them.
8 Double-click the MeetKevin image 
frame to select the image inside.
9 Position the pointer off any of the brown, image corner-bounding points. When 
you see the rotate arrow (
), click and drag clockwise a bit. Release the mouse, 
and then press the Escape key to select the frame.
10 Choose Edit > Undo Rotate Item.
11 Position the pointer away from the 
content, and click to deselect the image. 
Drag a selection marquee across the 
content to select all three objects. 
Choose Object > Group.
12 Choose File > Save Site. 
E Tip: You can also 
rotate an image frame 
using the same method 
with the Crop tool.
P Note: If your screen 
resolution allows it, you 
may see the X, Y, W, H, 
and rotation options 
in the Control panel as 
well as the Transform 
panel.

lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
Wrapping text around content
Muse allows you to wrap text around frames that contain text, images, or nothing. 
This can be a great way to insert an image into a story, which is common on news 
sites, or a way to create a large first letter for text, called a drop cap. There are lots 
of uses for wrapping text around frames.
Wrapping text involves the Wrap panel (Window > Wrap) and requires that you 
paste the rectangle that the text will wrap around into the text. In this exercise, 
you’ll place an image and wrap the story from the ABOUT page around it.
1 With the ABOUT page still open in Design mode, choose File > Place. In the 
Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder. Select the 
image named coffeebeans.jpg, and click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
2
Click to place the image anywhere on the page. Position doesn’t matter.
3
Choose Edit > Cut.
4
Select the Text tool and insert the cursor in front of the text that begins “Koffee 
Kart began as a whim…”
5 Choose Edit > Paste.
Muse pastes the image inline with 
the text. That means that it just flows 
with the text. If you tried to move 
the image with the Selection tool 
right now, you could only move it 
vertically because it is inline.
6 Click the Wrap panel tab to show the 
panel.
7 In the Wrap panel, click the Position Object To The Left button (
).
The Wrap panel offers three options for positioning the image: inline, position 
left, and position right. The default position is inline, and that’s what you 
see when you first paste the image into the text. Positioning the image to the 
right aligns it to the right and wraps the text around the left side of the image. 
Positioning the image to the left aligns it to the left and wraps the text around 
the right side of the image. You can try clicking each of the buttons to see what 
effect it has on the image and text, making sure that you click the Position 
Object To The Left button last.
P Note: Where you 
paste the rectangle 
matters. If you paste 
in the middle of a 
paragraph, then assign 
a left or right wrap, the 
top of the image aligns 
with the top of the line 
of text into which you 
pasted the image.
P Note: If you don’t 
see the Wrap panel in 
the workspace, you can 
choose Window > Wrap 
to open it.
E Tip: Any objects 
that you paste into text 
to apply a wrap can 
have fills, strokes, and 
other effects applied.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 159
Once you choose the correct image wrap option, you can also push the text 
away from the various edges of the image by using Offset in the Wrap panel.
8 In the Wrap panel, change Right Offset to 20. Change Left Offset to −50. A 
negative value on the left allows you to move the image outside of the text 
frame, which can create some interesting effects. Change Left Offset to 0. Leave 
the image selected for the next section.
9 Choose File > Save Site.
10 Click the Preview mode link to see the image, then click the Design mode link to 
return to the ABOUT page.
understanding the assets panel
As you know, Muse links the images that you place (File > Place) on a page to their 
original image files. The Assets panel (Window > Assets) shows a listing of these files 
as well as all the other assets (.swf files and so on) used in your entire site, no matter 
which page is open in the Document window. The Assets panel also gives you menu 
commands with which you can ensure that the images are all linked properly.
1 Choose Window > Assets to show the panel.
2 With the Selection tool, 
click once on the group that 
contains the MeetKevin.jpg 
image to select the group, 
then click once more on the 
MeetKevin.jpg image to select 
only that image. In the Assets 
panel’s list the selected image 
is now highlighted.
Clicking an image on a page 
selects that image in the 
Assets panel list. Assets listed in the Assets panel are listed alphabetically. You 
can click the column Name to sort them in descending, rather than ascending, 
order. Some assets listed have an arrow to the left of their name in the list. 
This indicates that there is more than one of that asset in the pages of the site. 
Clicking the arrow to the left of an asset expands the listing to detail every use 
E Tip: Try adding 
negative values to the 
other offsets. You can 
even get the text to 
appear over the image 
if you were to give the 
Right Offset a negative 
value.
P Note: If you attempt 
to select the image with 
the text wrap in the 
text frame by clicking 
with the Selection 
tool, you will select 
the text frame instead. 
Click once more on the 
image to select it. You 
can use the Selection 
Indicator to determine 
which element is 
selected: Text Frame 
means the text frame 
is selected, and Inline 
means that the image 
pasted in line with the 
text frame is selected.

160 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
of the image and the pages in the site where they appear. Muse calls an image on 
a page an instance of the original linked image file. As many times as a placed 
image appears in your site, every instance still links to the original image file. For 
example, if you placed the MeetKevin.jpg image on the HOME page as well as 
the ABOUT page, the expanded Assets panel would provide page details on both 
instances. Clicking an expanded arrow again closes the expanded listing and 
shows only the asset’s name.
3 Position the pointer over the MeetKevin.jpg image name in the assets list, and 
Muse provides a yellow tooltip with the path to the image.
That tooltip tells you where the original image is located on your hard drive.
4 Scroll up in the Assets panel, and notice the 
image named ArrowMenuDown.gif. Position 
the pointer over the name in the list.
The icon to the right of that image (
) indicates 
that it is embedded in the Muse site, meaning 
it does not link to an original image file. If you 
paste content from another application, Muse 
embeds the content in your page.
The Assets panel not only lists the assets that are linked and embedded, but it also 
gives you a lot of functionality found in context menus—from editing images to 
relinking images and more.
relinking images
After you place an image into Muse, circumstances sometimes may require you to 
replace that image (a different product becomes the monthly special, say) or link 
a different version of the original file to the instances on your pages (you recrop a 
photo to better highlight your office location). In the Assets panel, you can choose 
to relink an image, which replaces that image on a page.
On the ABOUT page, you are going to replace the coffeebeans.jpg image that you 
wrapped the text around.
1 With the Selection tool, click twice on the image that  
the text is wrapping around to select just the image. 
This also highlights the image in the Assets panel.
2 In the Assets panel, right-click (Windows) or Control-
click (Mac OS) the coffeebeans.jpg listing, and choose 
Relink in the context menu that appears.
P Note: When you 
place an image on 
a master page, the 
Assets panel lists only 
the master page, not 
every instance. Other 
assets, such as PSD 
buttons and SWF files, 
also follow this same 
behavior.
P Note: The 
ArrowMenuDown.gif 
came from the menu 
widget you inserted in 
a previous lesson.
E Tip: If you place the 
same asset on multiple 
pages, you can easily 
relink every instance of 
the image throughout 
the site. For example, 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
the parent listing (with 
the arrow to the left 
of it) in the Assets 
panel and choose 
Relink All Instances Of 
“image name.”

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 161
3 In the Relink dialog box, navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder, 
then to coffeebeans2.jpg, and click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
The new image replaces the old image  
in the frame, fitting proportionally in  
the frame.
P Note: When you relink an image that is not the same 
dimensions, Muse fits the new image proportionally 
and centers it in the rectangle. That can lead to a small 
image being made much larger or vice versa. It’s best to 
replace an image with an image of the same dimensions. 
You can also replace the image and scale the new image 
close to 100% using the Selection or Crop tools.
4 Choose File > Save Site.
editing original
From within Muse, you can open a placed image in an image-editing program like 
Photoshop, make changes, save the file, and come back to Muse to see it updated 
in your design. This is called the Edit Original command and is only available for 
placed assets that are linked.
P Note: To perform this exercise, you need Adobe Photoshop on your machine. If you do not have 
Photoshop, you can relink the DailyDrip.psd image in the Assets panel to DailyDrip-final.psd in the 
images folder within the Lessons folder. If you relink the image, make sure to select Import Layer and 
select the layer called banner text. Also, choose Clip To Layer Contents in the Image Import Options 
(DailyDrip-final.psd) dialog box.
1 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
2 With the Selection tool, right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Mac 
OS) the OurFounder.png image, and 
choose Edit Original from the context 
menu that appears.
3 With the image open in Photoshop, 
notice in the Layers panel (Window > 
Layers) that there is only one layer.
If you wanted to change the layers in the image import options, you would need 
to place the image again in Muse.
4
Choose Image > Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast.
5
Drag the Brightness slider to the left until the Brightness value is −30. Click OK.
6
Choose File > Save, then click OK in the PNG Options dialog box.
P Note: Using Edit 
Original can be helpful 
for .psd, .gif, and .png 
file formats, but you 
need to be careful with 
.jpg images. Every time 
you save a .jpg file, it’s 
further compressed 
and the image quality 
may begin to suffer 
eventually.
P Note: The program 
that the images open 
in is based on your 
Operating System file 
association settings. 
If you can’t get it to 
open in an image-
editing program, 
you can always go to 
your image-editing 
application (preferably 
Photoshop for this 
exercise) and open the 
file directly. You will 
need to update the 
modified link in Muse, 
and will learn about 
that in the next section.

162 
Lesson 6 
Adding Images to Your site
7 Choose File > Close to close the  
OurFounder.png file, then close 
Photoshop if you like (you don’t 
have to), returning to Muse.
The image should automatically 
update on the page. If you find the 
image hasn’t updated, you could 
always go to the image name in the 
Muse Assets panel, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) and choose 
Update Asset. The Assets panel displays a triangle icon with an exclamation 
point next to the asset’s name in this case.
8 Choose File > Save Site.
Fixing broken and modified links
The link between the original file and the instances you place in your site is 
extremely important, because if an image you placed moves from its original loca-
tion, Muse will consider that linked file to be missing and you will need to fix the 
link before publishing or exporting. Likewise, if an image that you placed in your 
site is opened, edited, and saved outside of Muse in a program like Photoshop, that 
image needs to be updated in Muse to show the changes.
You can fix missing and modified links easily in Muse, as you’ll see in this exercise.
1 Choose File > Open Site. In the Open 
dialog box, navigate to the Lesson06 
folder in the Lessons folder. Select the 
Muse site named FixLinks.muse, and 
click Select.
When you open a site that has missing 
and modified links, a warning dialog box appears. Clicking OK instructs Muse to 
update any modified assets in the site. You then need to go to the Assets panel to 
fix the missing links. Clicking Cancel opens the site but does not fix a thing. Be 
careful with clicking OK, because you may not know what has been modified.
2 Click Cancel in the warning dialog box.
3 In Plan mode, double-click the HOME page thumbnail to open the page in 
Design mode. Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
4 With the Assets panel showing (Window > Assets),  
scroll down in the panel until you see a red stop sign to 
the right of the DailyDrip.png listing.
5 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the 
name and choose Relink from the context menu that 
appears.
Before
After
P Note: The Edit 
Original command 
is not available for 
embedded content 
that was pasted from 
another program like 
Photoshop.
P Note: If the site 
you are opening has a 
missing asset only, the 
dialog box that appears 
will offer an OK button 
only, because you need 
to fix the missing link(s) 
in the Assets panel.
P Note: If the warning 
dialog box you see 
indicates more than one 
modified image, fix all 
of them in the Assets 
panel. 

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 163
6 In the Relink dialog box, navigate to the images folder in the Lessons folder. 
Select the image named DailyDrip.png, and click Select.
If the image had changed in dimensions, it would be fit proportionally in the 
frame.
7 In the Assets panel, right-click (Windows)  
or Control-click (Mac OS) the image name, 
cloud-1.png, and choose Update Asset from the 
context menu that appears.
Update Asset forces Muse to go look at the 
image again and update what you see on the 
page to match the changes made in the linked 
cloud-1.png image.
8 Choose File > Close Site. You don’t need to save this site.
Pinning content
You’ve invested a lot of time learning how to reposition content on a page and can 
now easily move an image in relation to the other elements (images, text, and media) 
that also exist on the page. But how do you make something always stay  visible when 
you scroll in the browser window? If a page is long (contains a lot of vertical con-
tent), visitors no longer can see content from the top of the page when they scroll 
down. What if you wanted a Twitter follow button, menu, or just an image to always 
be visible as the rest of the content scrolls. You need to pin the content. The Control 
panel makes pinning content easy. You simply set the pinned content, such as an 
image, to a specific location in relation to the edge of the browser window. It always 
stays in one spot regardless of other scrolling page elements.
The pinned element will move to maintain its pinned position in relation to the 
browser if the visitor resizes the browser window, but the pinned element will not 
move if the visitor scrolls the page content horizontally or vertically.
Next, you will pin a cloud image.
1 Back in the KevinsKoffeeKart site, click the Plan mode link, and when in Plan 
mode, double-click the HOME page thumbnail to open that page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder 
in the Lessons folder and then to the image named cloud.png. Click Open 
(Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
4 Click to place the image just off the right side of the page, so you can see part 
of the cloud on top of the background image. The exact position right now 
doesn’t matter.

164 
lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
5 In the Control panel, click the top-right  
position of the six possible options in 
the Pin tool located in the Control 
panel.
6 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn off the Smart Guides and snapping to 
other content and page elements.
7 With the Selection tool, drag the cloud so 
that the right edge of the frame is a bit to 
the left of the page width. See figure for 
placement help.
8 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them 
back on.
9 Click the Preview mode link and decrease 
and increase the width of the Preview 
window by dragging the bottom-right 
resize handle.
You’ll notice that the cloud image moves horizontally as you resize the width of 
the browser window and stays stuck to the right edge of the Preview window. 
Later, if you add more content to the home page to make it longer, the image 
will still stay put and remain visible—even if the visitor scrolls down to see the 
bottom of a lengthy page.
10 Click the Design mode link and choose File > Close Page to close the HOME 
page and return to the ABOUT page.
11 Choose File > Save Site.
Inserting flash files
Muse allows you to place published Flash files or .swf files in your pages. The Flash 
content you add to your Muse site can be created in any number of programs, 
including Adobe InDesign. Using the File > Place command, you can place .swf files 
in your site just like you do images.
1 Click the Plan mode link, and then double-click the MasterFlash thumbnail to 
open the page. Scroll up in the Document window so that you see the entire 
header area.
2 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box that appears, navigate to 
the Lessons folder and in the images folder, select the logo.swf file. Click 
Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS) to choose the file, and close the Import 
dialog box.
3 Position the Place Gun above the page area on the left side of the header, and 
click to place.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 165
You will see a frame appear with a Flash  
icon in the upper-left corner, indicating 
that .swf content is in that frame. Leave 
the frame selected on the page.
You learned earlier that by dragging, 
you can size content as you place it. In 
the case of Flash files, however, you’re 
better off placing the file at 100%. Be 
especially wary of resizing the file if it 
contains raster images, for instance. Resizing may distort certain content and it 
may become pixellated-looking. Because the .swf file is in a frame, you can resize 
it or move it to a different location on the page later.
4 With the Transform panel showing and the SWF file selected, change the X value 
to −350. Change the Y value to −185 to move the frame into position vertically.
A positive value for X moves content to the right, and a negative value moves it 
to the left. For the Y value, a positive value moves content down the page and a 
negative value moves it up.
5 Choose Object > Send To Back to send the SWF file behind the menu.
6 Click the Assets panel tab in the panel dock on the right side of the workspace.
When you place .swf content, Muse treats it like a placed image. The pages that 
contain the content link to the original file. That means that you can edit and 
replace the .swf file outside of Muse and update its content in Muse easily using 
the Assets panel.
.sWf content and associated files
When you publish your site to either Adobe hosting or by exporting the files to 
HTML, Muse creates the web pages and collects copies of the linked content, which 
is listed in the Assets panel, into a single folder. When you place a .swf file, the .muse 
site file links to the original .swf file that you placed, so Muse will collect it when the 
site is published or exported to HTML. If the .swf file requires external files to run, 
such as XML, ActionScript, or images, Muse will not collect those files when you 
publish or export the site. You will need to gather those files yourself and upload 
them to the host separately.

lesson 6 
Adding images to Your site
adding alternative text and a title to images
In Muse, you can add information such as alternative text and a title to your 
images. Alternative text is useful for several reasons, including for SEO purposes 
(depending on the search engine), for accessibility (to be read aloud by screen read-
ers), and to show when an image link is broken. Alternative text is intended to state 
the purpose of the image, but in addition to a sentence that describes the picture’s 
function you can include some relevant targeted keywords. Likewise, a title is a way 
to provide additional information about the image to search engines and visitors. 
Keep titles relevant, short, and descriptive. The image title actually appears as a 
tooltip in some browsers when a visitor hovers the cursor over the image.
You’ll find fields for adding alternative text and a title in the Image Properties dia-
log box in Muse. Setting alternative text or a title is typically done on an image-by-
image basis. If you have an image appearing multiple times throughout your site, 
it’s best to add alternative text and a title based on the context of the image.
1 On the ABOUT page, with the Selection tool, click the coffeebeans2.jpg image 
(the one with text wrapped around it) twice to select the image, not the text 
frame.
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the image, and choose 
Add Title from the context menu that appears.
The Image Properties dialog box appears. In this dialog box you can add both 
a title and alternative text if you choose.
3 In the Image Properties dialog box, enter San Francisco coffee supplier to 
the Bay Area in the Title field.
4 In the Alternative Text field, enter Koffee Kart gourmet coffee beans and 
click OK.
5 Choose File > Save Site, and leave the ABOUT page open for the next Lesson.
In the Lesson 7, “Working with Links and Buttons,” you’ll learn how to add links to 
other pages within your site and other sites, create e-mail links, add interactive but-
tons, create linking in a long page, and much more.
E Tip: You can 
also edit the title or 
alternative text for an 
image by right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-
clicking (Mac OS) the 
image file name in 
the Assets panel and 
choosing either Add 
Title or Add Alternative 
Text from the context 
menu that appears.

Which image file formats can you place into Muse?
2
Briefly describe the significance of an image link.
3
What options are available when placing a layered Photoshop file?
4
Where must an image or other rectangular frame be placed in order to wrap text 
around it?
5 What is meant by pinning content?
6 What are alternative text and an image title used for on the Web?
review answers
1 You can place .jpg, .gif, .png, and .psd (Photoshop) files by choosing File > Place in 
Muse.
2 When you place (File > Place) an image, Muse creates an image link between the 
instance of the image on the page and that image’s original file. If you later update the 
original file, Muse updates all instances of that image in your website as well.
3 When you place layered Photoshop files, the Image Import Options dialog box allows 
you to place a composite image (all visible layers showing) or selected layers. You can 
also crop the placed image to the bounds of the layer content.
4 To wrap text around content like an image, you must either cut or copy the image from 
its original location, insert the cursor in the text, and paste the image in the text frame. 
Then you can use the Wrap panel to set the wrapping options.
5 Pinned content is set to a specific location in relation to the edge of the browser 
window. It stays in one spot regardless of other scrolling page elements.
6 Alternative text is useful for several reasons, including for SEO purposes (depending 
on the search engine), for accessibility (to be read aloud by screen readers), and 
to appear when image links are broken. Adding a title to an image is a way to 
provide additional information about the image to search engines and visitors. Both 
alternative text and image titles should be relevant and descriptive.

Whether you need to link a website, link to a part of 
the same page, or create interactive buttons in Muse 
or Photoshop, Muse can help, enabling you to create 
and edit many types of links with ease, flexibility, and 
some great design features.

lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
Working with Links
A hyperlink, also called a link, takes your users to a resource on the Web or within 
your site. The resource can be anything that a computer can store and display: a 
web page, an image, a movie, a sound file, and more. With Muse, you can create 
three types of links: internal, external, and e-mail links.
The simplest hyperlink is an internal link, which takes the visitor to another part of 
the same page in Muse, another page in your site, or to other content, like a PDF, 
stored in the same site folder. An external link takes the visitor to a document or 
resource on another website or another Web host. An e-mail link is a link to an 
e-mail address that, when clicked, launches the visitor’s default e-mail program and 
creates a new e-mail to be sent to the e-mail address you enter in the link in Muse.
Creating an internal link
Muse makes it easy to add different types of hyperlinks to your content. In this sec-
tion, you’ll link text on the ABOUT page to other pages in your Muse site.
P Note: If you have not already done so, copy the Lessons folder onto your hard disk from the 
Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book disc. See “Copying the Classroom in a Book files” on page 3.
1 With your site open, and the ABOUT page open as well, choose View > Fit Page 
In Window.
2 Select the Text tool, and insert the cursor at the bottom of the main story (you 
may need to scroll down) after the text “This has been very important to Koffee 
Kart’s growth and continued success.” Press Enter or Return.
3 Type Learn more about our story and all of the exciting things coming to 
Kevin’s Koffee Kart!
4 With the cursor in the text, click the Text panel tab (Window > Text), and 
change the Space Before setting (
) to 16.
P Note: The exercises 
in this lesson, like others 
in this book, require 
that you have the 
fonts supplied on the 
Adobe Muse Classroom 
in a Book disc installed 
on your machine. For 
more information on 
installing the necessary 
fonts, see “Fonts used in 
this book” on page 2 of 
“Getting Started.”
P Note: If you are 
starting from scratch 
using the Jumpstart 
method described 
in the “Jumpstart” 
section on page 5 of 
“Getting Started,” your 
workspace may look 
different than the 
figures you see in this 
Lesson.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 171
5 Select the phrase “our story,” click the arrow to the right of the Hyperlink field in 
the Control panel, and choose OUR STORY.
The Hyperlink field menu lists all of the pages in the site, except for the master 
pages—even pages that are not included in the navigation, like GALLERYb.
6 Click in the “our story” text 
on the page to see the default 
blue and underline formatting 
applied. Later, you will change 
the appearance of the links 
you create. 
7 Select the Selection tool, and drag the bottom-middle bounding point of that 
same text frame down until the Min H (minimum height) value matches the H 
(height) value in the measurement label and the dotted line disappears.
8 Click the Preview mode link to see the links (you may need to scroll down on 
the page). Click the link to go to the OUR STORY page.
By default, when you create a text link, the new page or website replaces the 
existing page in the same browser window or tab.
9 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page.
Creating an external link
Besides linking to pages within your site, you can also link to other websites. These 
links are called external links.
1 Select the Text tool, and select the first instance of the words “San Francisco” in 
the first paragraph.
P Note: You can’t add 
a text link to selected 
text that has been 
rotated or that uses a 
System Font because it 
will be rasterized when 
the site is published 
or exported. You can, 
however, add a link to 
a rotated text frame or 
font by selecting the 
text frame, not the text, 
and applying the link 
to it.
P Note: Notice the 
Hyperlink field menu is 
dimmed. To change a 
link on text, you need to 
select all of the text that 
is linked.

172 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
2 Insert the cursor in the Hyperlink field, type maps.google.com, and then press 
Enter or Return.
At any time later, you can select the “San Francisco” text and edit the hyperlink.
3 Click the Preview mode link to see the links on the ABOUT page. Click the San 
Francisco link to go to maps.google.com.
By default, the linked website (maps.google.com) replaces the original page in 
the Muse Preview window. In Muse, there is no back button, so once you click 
to view an external link, you need to click the Design mode link to return to the 
original page.
4 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page.
Creating an e-mail link
You create an e-mail link exactly as you do an external link, only instead of provid-
ing a website address, you type an e-mail address.
1 With the Text tool, click and drag to create a text frame below the image of 
Kevin on the right side of the page. Make sure that the left edge of the text 
frame aligns with the left edge of the third column and that it’s as wide as the 
column. Type kevin@kevinskoffeekart.com.
2 Click the Paragraph 
Styles panel tab to show 
the panel. With the 
cursor in the e-mail 
address, click the style 
named “StepBody small.”
3 Select the address kevin@
kevinskoffeekart.com, 
and choose Edit > Copy.
P Note: Muse adds the 
http:// to the website 
URL, so you don’t have 
to type that.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 173
4 Insert the cursor in the Hyperlink  
field in the Control panel, and choose 
Edit > Paste. Press Enter or Return. 
You could have typed the e-mail 
address into the field, but this is faster.
5 Click the Preview mode link to see 
the email link you just created (you 
may need to scroll down). Click the 
kevin@kevinskoffeekart.com link to 
open the default e-mail application on 
your machine.
E Tip: If you want to add more e-mail addresses, 
type a comma (,) after kevin@kevinskoffeekart.
com and add another. After every e-mail address 
(except the last one), type a comma.
6 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
editing link properties
By default, links you create open the linked page or site in the same window or tab, 
replacing the page you’re linking from. You can change this setting to make external 
links open in another browser window or tab so that your site remains open for 
visitors to return to.
1
With the Text tool, select the linked text “San Francisco” in the first paragraph.
2
Click the word “Hyperlink” in the Control panel to see the Hyperlink options.
3
Select Open The Link In A New Window Or Tab.
This option opens the linked page or website in a new window or tab.
4 In the Title field, type map location of Kevin’s Kart in San Francisco.
P Note: The text on 
the page doesn’t have 
to be the actual e-mail 
address. You may see 
phrases like “E-mail us” 
or “Contact us” instead.
P Note: If you 
don’t have an e-mail 
application installed 
on your machine, the 
link will do nothing. 
If you have an e-mail 
application installed, 
but it’s not set up, you 
may be asked to set 
it up when the link is 
clicked. If the e-mail 
application is installed 
and configured, a new 
message window will 
appear with the e-mail 
address automatically 
entered in the To field.

174 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
A link title can be beneficial in several ways. It shows as a tooltip in some 
browsers when the cursor is over the text link on the page, it can be read aloud 
by screen readers, and it can give more information to search engines, among 
other things. The title text provides information about where the link will send 
the user, and can contain keywords and other relevant information.
5 Press the Escape key to hide the Hyperlink options.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
styling your text links
When you create text links, you’ll likely want to change their appearance to better 
match your design and to differentiate the various types of links with unique styling. 
For instance, in the Koffee Kart site, the links in the footer will need to be white, or a 
lighter color, to be readable on the brown, but links in the page area will need to be 
a darker color to be readable. Of course, all of your links should still give the appear-
ance of being a link and clickable. In this section, you’ll edit the default appearance 
of the links, called Link Styles, and create styling for different types of links.
1 Click the word “Hyperlink” in the Control panel, and then click the Edit Link 
Styles button in the Hyperlink options to open the Site Properties dialog 
box. These are the same site properties you can access by choosing File > Site 
Properties.
Every site in Muse has default formatting for the text links. That default style 
is called [Default Link Style] and is listed in the Site Properties dialog box. You 
can change the appearance of the default link style and all text links in your site 
will change to match. Link styles also have four states: normal, hover, visited, 
and active. See the sidebar “About link states” to learn more about states. For 
each state, you can change the color, add bold or italic, and remove or keep 
the underline.
2 Click the Normal color, and in the Color Picker that appears, click to select the 
red color swatch with the values R: 193, G: 39, B: 45. Click away from the Color 
Picker panel to hide it and return to the Site Properties dialog box.
3 Select the box in the  
Underline column 
once until the box is 
blank. This will 
remove the under-
line for all of your 
links.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 175
P Note: When you click several times on one of the boxes in either the Bold, Italic, or Underline 
columns, you will see that there are three selection options: a check mark, a blank box, and a box 
with a filled box inside. A check mark indicates that the formatting is applied to the link; for instance, 
a check mark in the Underline column tells the browser to underline the link and write that in the 
code. A blank box tells Muse to write the code for underline, but set it at the default of no underline. 
A box with a filled box inside tells Muse not to write anything in the code for underline—leaving the 
formatting at default (no underline).
4 Change the color for Hover to the Footer Stroke color (you can try another color 
if you like), and leave the rest of the options for Hover at default.
5 Change the color for Visited to a lighter version of the FooterBG color, and leave 
the rest of the options at default.
6 Leave the Active options at the their defaults. You can always experiment later. 
Leave the dialog box open for the next steps.
about link states
On the Web, text links have four states: link, visited, hover, and active. You can create 
different styling for each state of a link. These states are similar to the functionality 
of the states found in States panel in Muse.
•
Normal: This is the first state that visitors will see. When a page is opened and 
the text links appear, the normal state is what a link looks like when a visitor 
hasn’t interacted with it yet.
•
Hover: When a visitor positions the cursor over a link on your web page, you can 
change the appearance of the link.
•
Visited: After a visitor clicks a text link, then returns to the same page, you can 
change the appearance of the link to indicate that the link has been clicked 
previously.
•
Active: The active state can change the appearance of the link between the 
times the visitor presses the mouse button and releases it.

176 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
7 Click the New Link Style button (
) at the bottom of the Site Properties 
dialog box.
Muse creates a new link style in the Site Properties dialog box that is an exact 
copy of the default link style. The default link style applies to every link by 
default, but you can apply your new style to text links that you want to look and 
behave differently. This new link style will be available for use on every page 
within the current site only.
8 Double-click to select the new style named “[Default Link Style] copy,” and 
rename it email links.
9 Leave the settings for the four states at default, except for the Normal state. In 
the Normal state, select the box in the Underline column until a check mark 
appears to add an underline. Click OK.
10 With the Text tool, select the  
kevin@kevinskoffeekart.com text, 
click the word “Hyperlink” in the 
Control panel and select the style 
named “email links” from the Text 
Link Style menu.
11 Choose File > Preview Site In 
Browser. After the Home page loads, 
click ABOUT in the top menu 
widget to open the ABOUT page. 
Interact with the links by hovering 
the cursor over one, and notice the change. Click and hold down, without 
releasing the mouse button; in most major browsers the active state formatting 
will show. Click the San Francisco link, and notice that the maps.google.com page 
opens in a new window or a new tab. Return to the original window or tab to see 
the ABOUT page and the visited link style displayed.
12 Close the browser and return to Muse.
P Note: Later, you can 
change the appearance 
of the link styles or 
create more in the Site 
Properties dialog box. 
There is also a Delete 
button to remove any 
link styles that you don’t 
want to keep. You can 
use these link styles 
throughout your site.
E Tip: You can 
also apply link styles 
in the Text panel 
(Window > Text).
P Note: If you see the 
visited link appearance 
on some of the links 
when you test the 
page, it’s because your 
browser has those links 
cached (you’ve visited 
them before). You can 
clear the browser’s 
cache.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 177
Adding links to images
To add a link to an image, you follow the same steps as for creating a text link. 
Instead of selecting text, however, you select an image. Most sites have a link on the 
company logo to the home page of the site, and that’s exactly what you are going to 
add here.
1 Click the Plan mode link, and double-click the A-Master page thumbnail.
2 With the Selection tool, select the Kevin’s Koffee Kart logo image in the header 
on the A-Master page. Drag the image so that the bottom of the bicycle wheels 
align with the top edge of the brown in the menu, and the left edge of the logo 
aligns with the left edge of the menu.
3 With the logo selected, choose HOME from the Pages section of the Hyperlink 
options menu to the right of the word Hyperlink in the Control panel.
4 Click the Preview mode link, and click on the logo to navigate to the HOME page.
5 Click the Design mode link to return to the A-Master page, then choose File > 
Close Page.
6 Choose File > Save Site.
Working with anchors
Long pages with a lot of vertical content to scroll through can be cumbersome for 
visitors to navigate. You can alleviate this issue in Muse by creating internal links 
that make the page jump to a specified section when a visitor clicks the link. The 
commonly used Back to Top link, which quickly scrolls to the top of the page when 
clicked, is a good example of this type of internal link.
To link to a part of a page, you need to insert an anchor at the desired spot and 
then link to that anchor. The anchors are invisible to visitors, but allow you to cre-
ate internal links to different parts of a page.
E Tip: Notice the 
Recently Used Links at 
the top of the Hyperlink 
menu. External or 
e-mail links that you 
type in are listed here 
so that if you want 
to reuse them in this 
site, you can just select 
them in the menu.

178 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
Creating anchors
The first step toward aiding visitors in scrolling long pages is to insert the anchors 
to which you will later link.
1 Click the Plan mode link, and open the Preparation page by double-clicking its 
thumbnail. After the page opens, make sure that the page is scrolled all the way 
to the top.
2 Click the Anchor button (
) in the Control panel. The pointer will change to a 
Place Gun. Position the Place Gun at the very top of the page, below the ruler, 
toward the left edge of header. Click to insert an anchor and open the Create An 
Anchor dialog box.
3 In the Create An Anchor dialog box, change the name to top and click OK.
You should now see the anchor icon on the page with the word “top” to the right. 
With the Selection tool you can move the anchor, or you can select it and press 
Delete to remove it. If you need to rename the anchor, right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) the anchor icon and choose Rename Anchor from the 
context menu that appears.
4 Click the Anchor button in the Control panel twice.
Move the Place Gun cursor in the page, and you’ll see the anchor icon with (2) 
to its right (
). Clicking the Anchor button twice loads two anchors into the 
Place Gun that you can then place.
5 Scroll down the page until you see the text “French Press” in red.
6 Position the Place Gun on the left edge of the first column and above French 
Press. (See the figure for placement help.) Click to place another anchor.
P Note: When you click a link that is linked to an anchor farther down the page, the page will scroll 
so that the anchor is at the top of the browser window. For example, if the anchor is aligned with the 
“French Press” text, the page will scroll so that French Press is at the very top of the browser window.
E Tip: You can also 
choose Object > Insert 
Link Anchor to insert an 
anchor.
P Note: You can 
name anchors anything 
you want, just keep it 
simple. Anchor names 
cannot start with a 
number, and Muse will 
warn you if you use an 
illegal character.
E Tip: You can also 
copy and paste an 
anchor on the page 
when it’s selected, or 
press Alt (Windows)/
Option (Mac OS) while 
you drag the anchor 
with the Selection tool 
to create a copy, and 
then rename it.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 179
7 In the Create An Anchor dialog box, change the name to FrenchPress, and 
click OK.
8 Scroll down the page until you see the word “Espresso” in red, position the Place 
Gun on the left edge of the first column and above Espresso,” and click to place 
another anchor.
9 In the Create An Anchor dialog box, change the name to Espresso, and click OK.
Linking to an anchor
Now that the anchors are in place, you can create links to the anchors.
1 Scroll back to the top of the Preparation page.
2 Select the Text tool, and create a text frame on top of the aqua rectangle at 
the top of the first column. Type DRIP COFFEE. Select the text, and click the 
Heading style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply the style. In the Control 
panel, click the Font menu and choose the New Gothic Std Bold font from the 
System Fonts (Exports As Image) menu.
3 Select the Selection tool, and position 
and size the text frame like in the figure.
4 Press and hold Shift+Alt (Windows) or 
Shift+Option (Mac OS) and drag the text 
frame straight down to create a copy. 
Release the mouse button and then the 
keys. See the figure for how far to drag 
the frame.

180 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
	
Create one more copy for a total of three text frames. When dragging the last 
one down, you will see the gap measurements to help you space the frames 
evenly. Once again, release the mouse button and then the keys. If your gap 
measurement doesn’t match the figure exactly, that’s okay.
Create the first copy
Create the second copy
You are going to apply the link to the text frame, but not by selecting the 
text like you did earlier. Applying the link to a text frame will not change the 
appearance of the text in the frame. That’s why you are creating three separate 
text frames, because each text frame will link to a different anchor.
6 Using the Text tool, change the middle text frame’s text to FRENCH PRESS and 
the text in bottom text frame to ESPRESSO.
7 Change the text color of FRENCH PRESS 
to a red color and the ESPRESSO text 
color to black in the Control panel.
8 Select the Selection tool, and click the 
text frame that contains the phrase “DRIP 
COFFEE.”
9 Click the arrow to the right of the Hyperlink field in the Control panel. In the 
menu that appears, you’ll see a new category called Anchors. You may need 
to scroll down in the menu because anchors appear last in the list. Choose 
Preparation:top.
P Note: Notice that 
the link has been 
applied to the text 
frame and the text 
inside hasn’t changed 
in appearance. The text 
doesn’t change because 
the font applied to 
the text is a system 
font, so although it is 
editable text, the text 
frame will be rendered 
as an image (not text 
content) when the site 
is previewed, published, 
or exported as HTML.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 181
10 Select the text frame that contains the phrase “FRENCH PRESS,” and choose 
Preparation:FrenchPress by clicking the arrow to the right of the Hyperlink field 
in the Control panel.
E Tip: The reason why the link appears as Preparation:FrenchPress in this example, and not just 
FrenchPress, is to indicate that the anchor is on the page named Preparation. This sort of naming 
scheme helps if you plan to link between pages. If you open another page and create a link to this 
same anchor, for example, Muse will open the Preparation page first, then scroll down to the anchor 
named FrenchPress when the link is clicked.
11 Select the text frame that contains ESPRESSO, and choose Preparation:Espresso 
by clicking the arrow to the right of the Hyperlink field in the Control panel.
12 With the Selection tool, drag a marquee selection across the aqua-filled frame 
and the three text frames. Choose Object > Group.
E Tip: You can hide the Rasterized Text Frame indicators by choosing View > Hide Rasterized Text 
Frame Indicators.
13 Click the top-middle position of the six possible options in the Pin tool (
) 
located in the Control panel.
This pins the entire group to the center of the browser window horizontally 
(which will be the horizontal center of the page) and the same position down, 
relative to the top of the browser window.
14 Click the Preview mode link and click the FRENCH PRESS link, then click the 
DROP COFFEE link to return to the top of the page.
Notice that the page slides down smoothly. Also notice that group of three links 
is pinned in place and floating above the other content.
15 Click the Design mode link to return to the Preparation page and choose File > 
Close Page.

182 
Lesson 7 Working with Links and Buttons
Working with buttons
On the Web, designers use buttons as well as links to link to other content, other 
pages, or other websites. A button is usually styled to look more three-dimensional 
so it resembles a physical button that you can press. Buttons tend to appear on 
a web page less frequently than text links. Site designers use them primarily to 
encourage users to do something or as a call to action on a website, giving them 
action names like Buy, SignUp, Search, or View My Portfolio.
Creating a button in Muse
You can create a button out of almost any object in your design—text frames, 
image frames, and rectangle shapes. Muse lets you change the appearance of the 
button object with states, a background color and image, strokes, effects like drop 
shadows, rounded corners, and much more.
In this section, you’ll create a button from a text frame, using the States panel and 
adding a link to it. This button will refresh a Google map that you will add in a 
Lesson 8, “Applying Effects, Graphic Styles, and Inserting HTML.”
1 Click the Plan mode link and double-click the KART MAP page thumbnail to 
open the page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Select the Text tool. Click and drag to create a text frame starting in the 
upper-left corner of the first column guides, stretching all the way to the right 
edge of the third column across the page. Make sure that it has a height of 
approximately 50px.
P Note: Don’t worry if the frame isn’t positioned to match the figure exactly. In Lesson 8, you will 
move it into its final position.
4 Type CLICK TO GET DIRECTIONS!
5 Select the text. In the Control panel, change Font to the Web Safe font Geneva, 
set Font Size to 34, click the Bold button, and change the color to white.

6 Select the Selection tool, and Muse selects the text frame. Click the Fill link 
in the Control panel, and click the Choose Background Image folder icon 
to select a background image for the text frame. Navigate to the images folder 
in the Lessons folder, and choose the image named MapFindUs.png. Click 
Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS). Make sure that Original Size is chosen 
in the Fitting menu and that the upper-left corner (
) is selected for the 
Position option.
The entire background image will not show in the text frame, but you will see 
the text again.
7 With the Selection tool, drag the right-middle bounding point of the text frame 
to the right until you see the entire background image. Stop when you see a 
width of approximately 915px. Drag the bottom-middle bounding point down 
until you see the entire banner image in the background. Make the frame a little 
taller than the image, approximately 60px.
8 Click the Spacing panel tab (Window > Spacing) on the right side of the 
workspace to reveal the panel. Change the left padding to 40 and the top 
padding to 3.
As you saw in Lesson 3, “Working with Master Pages,” the Spacing panel allows 
you to add padding inside the frame. In this case, padding pushes the text in 
from the edge of the text frame.
9 Click the Preview mode link and check out the new button you’ve started. Click 
the Design mode link to return to the page in Design mode, leaving the text 
frame selected.

lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
using the states panel to add button states
Muse allows you to add states to your button. As you’ve learned previously, states 
are useful for indicating a change in appearance when visitors interact with the but-
ton. You don’t have to add states to a button, but as you’ll see, sometimes it can be 
good to indicate that something will happen when the button is clicked.
1 Click the States panel tab (Window > States) on the right side of the workspace.
2 With the text frame still selected, click the Rollover 
state in the States panel.
P Note: You need to have the frame selected, not the text, in 
order to edit the states using the States panel.
3 In the Text panel, change the color of the text to the FooterBG swatch.
This is a really simple rollover option, but you could have instead replaced 
the background image, added an underline to the text, almost any number of 
changes to the text frame or text.
Look in the States panel, and you will see that the Mouse Down state looks 
the same as the Rollover state. You could change the appearance of the Mouse 
Down or Active (Normal) state if you like, but in this case it’s not necessary.
4 Click the Normal state again in the States panel to see the white text.
5 Click the Preview mode link to preview the button. Position the pointer over 
anywhere in the text frame, and you will see the rollover state change.
6 Click the Design mode link to return to the KART MAP page in Design mode.
7 Choose File > Save Site.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 185
adding a link to a button
Adding a link to a button typically involves selecting the button (frame), not the 
contents, before adding the link.
1 With the text frame still selected, click the arrow to the right of the Hyperlink 
field in the Control panel. Choose KART MAP from the menu.
It may seem odd to be linking to the same page that you are on, but this will be a 
placeholder link until you insert a Google map into the page in the next lesson.
2 Click the Preview mode link to preview the button. Position the pointer over 
the text frame, and the rollover state may not change because it is linking to 
the same page that it’s on. Don’t worry, you will change the link at the end of 
Lesson 8, and the rollover will work again.
3 Click the Design mode link to return to the KART MAP page in Design mode.
4 Choose File > Save Site, then File > Close Page to close the KART MAP page.
setting up a button in Photoshop
Although you can create buttons in Muse, you also have the option of creating 
a button in a program like Photoshop, which gives you even greater design flex-
ibility. Using the File > Place Photoshop Button command, you can then place the 
layered .psd file on you page. If you name the layers in Photoshop the same as the 
typical states found in the States panel—Normal, Rollover, Down, and Active—
Muse automatically assigns the content on those named layers to the state with the 
same name in the States panel.
P Note: When naming the layers in Photoshop to match a Muse state name like Normal, the 
names are not case-sensitive. For example, in Photoshop you could name a layer normal, Normal, 
NORMAL, or any combination of upper- and lowercase. Muse still would recognize it and assign it 
to the Normal state.
In this exercise, you will open Photoshop and explore a button that is set up using 
best practices for placement in Muse.
1 Open Adobe Photoshop.
2 Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the images folder in the 
Lessons folder. Select the image named twitter_button.psd, and click Open.
P Note: For this 
exercise, you need 
to have Photoshop 
installed on your 
machine. If you do not, 
you can skip to the next 
section, “Placing your 
Photoshop button.”

186 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
3 Open the Layers panel (Window > Layers) and you’ll  
see two layers named normal and rollover.
Remember, when you place a Photoshop button (.psd 
file) in Muse, you can select a single layer for each 
state that you want the button to have. For any states 
in Muse that you don’t care to use, don’t include a 
layer with the name of that state in the Photoshop file. Also, ensure that any 
layers you want to show in Muse have content on them.
Looking at the Layers panel in Photoshop, you will see that the layers in the 
Photoshop button file (.psd) are each Smart Objects and have a unique layer 
thumbnail (
). Smart Objects are layers that can contain image data from 
raster or vector images, such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator files.
Because the layers in a group in your .psd file will show up in the Photoshop 
Import Options but the groupings themselves are ignored, you’re better off 
creating Smart Objects from your layers with multiple layers of content in each 
Smart Object layer.
4 Close Photoshop and return to Muse.
Placing your Photoshop button
With the Photoshop button created, you can now place it in Muse using the File > 
Place Photoshop Button command.
1 With the ABOUT page showing in Design mode, choose View > Fit Page In 
Window. If the ABOUT page is not open, in Plan mode, double-click the 
ABOUT page thumbnail to open it in Design mode.
2 Choose File > Place 
Photoshop Button. 
Navigate to the images 
folder in the Lessons folder, 
and select the image named 
twitter-button.psd. Click 
Open (Windows) or Select 
(Mac OS).
In the Photoshop Import 
Options dialog box, Muse 
assigns layers in the 
Photoshop file to a state 
of the same name, if those 
layers are present. For each 
state of the button in Muse, you can choose a different layer in the Photoshop 
file. Notice that the Normal state has the layer named normal selected and the 
P Note: Placing a 
Photoshop button 
creates a link to the 
original .psd file and 
adds it to the list in the 
Assets panel. As with 
other assets listed in the 
panel, you can relink 
the button to another 
Photoshop file, embed 
the link, and more.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 187
Rollover state has the layer named rollover selected automatically. The Mouse 
Down and Active states have nothing selected because the Photoshop file 
contained no layers named mouse down or active.
E Tip: You don’t have to name the Photoshop layers the same as the states. You can name them 
whatever you like and simply choose them from the menus in the Photoshop Import Options 
dialog box.
3 Click the Normal State menu, and you can see the Photoshop layers in the file 
listed as well as the Composite option.
Selecting the Composite option for the Normal state would show all of the layer 
content visible in Photoshop when the file was last saved.
4 Click OK.
5 Click to place the button just below the e-mail link kevin@kevinskoffeeKart.com 
on the page.
6 Click the Rollover state in the States panel; notice that Muse is using the rollover 
layer from Photoshop as the rollover state. Muse also uses it as the Down state 
for this button, while the normal layer from Photoshop is used as the Active 
(Normal) state.
You can select each state and add different effects like a drop shadow or even 
rounded corners. When you publish or export the site, Muse will save the states 
as separate images.
E Tip: With the button frame selected, if you click the Fill link in the Control panel, you will see 
that the layers in the Photoshop file become background images in the states of the button. This is 
similar to how you created the button on the KART MAP page.
P Note: Any layers in 
the Photoshop file that 
are empty will not show 
in the state menus in 
the Photoshop Import 
Options dialog box.

188 
lesson 7 Working with links and buttons
edit the Photoshop button
Just as you can do with other assets listed in the Assets panel, you can edit a but-
ton’s original file (in this case, edit the .psd file in Photoshop) and update it in Muse. 
With the button selected on the page, you can open the Assets panel (Window > 
Assets), right-click the name of the .psd file, and choose Edit Original in the context 
menu that appears. Edit the image in Photoshop, save it, and return to Muse to see 
the updates. This allows you to edit each of the layers in the Photoshop file.
If you delete a layer in Photoshop that is named after a state in Muse, the corre-
sponding state will revert to the Normal state content. On the flip side, if you add a 
layer to the Photoshop button file that is named after a Muse state, when you save 
the Photoshop file and return to Muse, the new layer will become the contents for 
the corresponding state.
adding a link to your Photoshop button
With the Photoshop button on the page, you need to add some sort of interactivity 
to it. In this case, you will add a link to the Twitter page for Kevin Koffee.
1 With the image frame still selected, insert the cursor in the Hyperlink field in 
the Control panel. Type twitter.com/kevinkoffeekart/. Press Enter or Return 
to accept it. Muse adds the “http://” automatically.
2 Click the Preview mode link to preview the button. Position the pointer over the 
text frame to see the rollover state change. Click to see twitter.com.
3 Click the Design mode link to return to the ABOUT page in Design mode.
4 Choose File > Save Site, then File > Close Page to close the ABOUT page and 
return to Plan mode with no pages open.

review answers
1 The three generic types of links that you can create in Muse are: internal, external, and 
e-mail. Internal links take the user to another part of the same document or to another 
page or document in the site. An external hyperlink is designed to take the user to 
another website, or web host. An e-mail link is intended to launch the visitor’s default 
e-mail software and compose an e-mail.
2 A link title shows as a tooltip in some browsers when the cursor is over the text link on 
the page; it can be read aloud by screen readers, and it can give more information to 
search engines, among other things.
3 An anchor allows you to link to a part of a page. The anchor is invisible to site visitors, 
but it gives a link a place to scroll to.
4 If you select the text frame and not the text, then apply a link, the appearance of the 
text within the frame isn’t changed.
5 Placing a layered Photoshop file using the Place Photoshop Button command opens 
the Photoshop Import Options dialog box. In this dialog box you can apply layers 
in the Photoshop file to states in the button.

Muse has a lot of great options to add punch to your 
web designs, including drop shadows and other 
effects, rounded corners, embedding HTML like a 
Google map, saving object formatting as graphic 
styles, and much more.

L
Working with rounded corners, 
effects, and opacity
In Muse, there are many formatting options that can help you to add some real 
design flair to the content on your pages, aid in readability, keep up with today’s 
design trends, and more. Those formatting options include Effects, which encom-
pass drop shadows, bevels, and glows, rounded corners, and opacity (transparency) 
changes. All of these options are easily applied to content from the Control panel. 
You’ll experiment with all of these formatting options in the exercises that follow, 
starting with rounded corners.
P Note: The exercises in this lesson, like others in this book, require that you have the fonts 
supplied on the Muse Classroom in a Book disc installed on your machine. For more information on 
installing the necessary fonts, see “Fonts used in this book” on page 2.
rounding the corners of a frame
You can round the corners on a text frame, image frame, or rectangle. In addition, 
you can round each corner individually or round all of a frame’s corners at once. 
Either way, you can easily adjust your initial rounding settings, as you’ll see in this 
section.
1 In Plan mode with the KevinsKoffeeKart site open, double-click the Preparation 
page thumbnail to open the page in Design mode.
2 With the Selection tool, click to select the aqua rectangle with the three links in 
it. Notice that the Selection Indicator in the Control panel shows Group. Click 
once more in the aqua color above the DRIP COFFEE text frame to select the 
aqua rectangle.
3 Press Control+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) several times to zoom 
into the rectangle.
4 Change the Corner 
Radius to 10 in the 
Control panel.
Changing the Corner 
Radius changes all four 
corners of the shape to 
a radius of 10 pixels. 
The larger the radius, 
the more rounded the 
corner will become.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book disc. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 193
5 Click the Preview mode link to see the rounded corners. Click the Design mode 
link to return to the page.
6 Click the upper-left Enable/Disable button (
) in the Control panel (to the 
right of the Corners text link). Click the lower-left Enable/Disable button (
) in 
the Control panel as well.
You can turn on and off the corner radius for each corner of a selected frame to 
give you much more creative control.
7 Change the Corner Radius value to 20.
8 Press the Escape key to select the group. With the Selection tool, drag the right-
middle bounding point to the left until the width of the group is approximately 
240px in the measurement label.
9 With the group selected, set the X value to 0 in the Control panel, if your screen 
resolution allows it, or open the Transform panel and set the X value to 0.
Setting the X value to 0 aligns the left edge of the group with the left edge of the 
page area.
10 Choose File > Save Site and leave the Preparation page open.
P Note: To remove 
the rounded corners, 
you could change 
the Rounded Corners 
value to 0 or click the 
Enable/Disable buttons 
until they all show a 
square corner.

L
applying a shadow effect
The first type of effect that you will explore is the Shadow effect (sometimes 
referred to as drop shadows). Drop shadows on the Web can add depth to your 
design content, so that it takes on a more 3D appearance. You can add drop shad-
ows to a text frame, image frame, or rectangle.
1 Click the Plan mode link, and double-click the HOME page thumbnail to open 
the home page in Design mode.
2 Click to select the DAILY DRIP image with the Selection tool, then press 
Control+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) several times to zoom into 
the image.
3 Click the Effects link in the 
Control panel to reveal the 
Effects options. Making 
sure that Shadow category 
is chosen at the top of the 
options, select On.
The effect options that appear 
contain three types of effects: 
Shadow, Bevel, and Glow as 
well as the specific options for 
each effect.
4 Click the Color in the Shadow options, and select the Footer Stroke color 
swatch to change the color of the drop shadow. Click back in the Shadow 
options menu to hide the Color Picker.
5 Change the rest of the shadow 
options to the following:
•
Opacity: 30
•
Size: 5 (specifies the 
“thickness” of the shadow)
•
Angle: 45 (moves the 
drop shadow around the 
rectangle; use the default)
•
Distance: 4 (specifies the 
distance between the drop 
shadow and rectangle)
P Note: Notice that the drop shadow follows the contour of the image, not the edges of the image 
frame. If you were to apply a color fill to the same image frame, the drop shadow would follow the 
contour of the color fill. If you were to apply a background image to the image frame, the drop 
shadow would follow the contours of the background image or image in the frame.
P Note: You can 
apply a shadow to only 
rasterized text or to 
the frame that the text 
is in if it’s filled with a 
color. You cannot apply 
shadows to frames filled 
with a background 
image nor to ordinary, 
non-rasterized text.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 195
Try adjusting the settings to see the effect it has on the shadow. Be sure to return 
to the settings in step 5 when you are ready to continue. Click away from the 
Effects options to hide them.
6 Choose File > Save Site, then choose File > Close Page to return to the 
Preparation page.
applying a Bevel effect
The Bevel effect adds a beveling to the edge of an object, such as an image or frame 
filled with color. You can apply the Bevel effect to give objects a more realistic, 
three-dimensional look.
1 On the Preparation page, with the group of objects still selected, click once 
more to select just the aqua rectangle.
2 Click the Effects link in the Control panel to reveal the Effects options. Click 
the Bevel category at the top of the options, select On, then change the Bevel 
options to
•
Opacity: 20
•
Size: 0
•
Angle: 60
•
Distance: 3 (specifies the distance between the border of the rectangle and 
the faded edge of the bevel)
Try adjusting the settings to see the effect on the bevel, but be sure to return to 
the settings in step 2 when you are ready to continue. Click away from the Effects 
options to hide them.
3 Click the Preview mode link to preview the bevel effect. Click the Design mode 
link to return to the Preparation page, then choose File > Close Page.
4 Choose File > Save Site.

L
applying a Glow effect
The Glow effect causes a glow to emanate from under the object, but you can also 
apply a glow to the inside of an object. You can apply a glow to a rectangle, image 
frame, or rasterized text. In this exercise, you’ll insert a new image into the footer 
and apply a Glow effect to it on the A-Master page.
1 In Plan mode, double-click the A-Master page thumbnail to open the master 
page in Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder 
in the Lessons folder. Select the image named coffeecup.png and click Open 
(Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
4 Click to place the image at 100% on the right side of the page, above the footer. 
Zoom in a bit, and scroll the page so that you see the footer area. Drag the 
coffee cup image down to insert it into the footer area below the footer guide.
Like you’ve seen before, the footer guide will simply move down because the 
new image isn’t a footer item by default.
5 With the image selected, select Footer in the Control panel to assign the coffee 
cup image to the footer. Drag the image to approximately match the position 
you see in the figure, making sure that the top edge of the coffee cup is below 
the footer guide.
E Tip: You could also 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
the coffee cup image 
and choose Footer Item 
from the context menu 
that appears, or you 
could choose Object > 
Footer Item.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 197
6 Click the Effects link in the  
Control panel to reveal the effect 
options. Click the Glow category 
at the top of the options, then 
select On.
Notice the glow outside the 
edges of the image.
7 Select Inner Glow to apply the 
glow to the inside edges of the 
coffee cup image. 
8 Click the Fill color, and select the FooterBG color swatch to change the color of 
the glow. Click back in the Glow options menu to hide the Color Picker.
9 Change the rest of the Glow 
options to
• Opacity: 40
• Size: 20
Try adjusting the settings to see 
the effect on the glow, but be 
sure to return to the settings in 
steps 7 to 9 when you are ready 
to continue. Click away from the 
Effects options to hide them.
10 Choose Rasterized Text Frame Indicators from the View Options menu above 
the Control panel. This disables the rasterized text frame indicators and lets 
you look at the footer without the indicators showing in the menu. Choose 
Rasterized Text Frame Indicators from the View Options menu to select and 
show them again.
E Tip: You can apply 
multiple effects to 
a single object. For 
instance, you could also 
add a drop shadow to 
the coffee cup image to 
give it a more realistic, 
three-dimensional look.
E Tip: The View 
Options menu to the 
right of the Tools panel 
is another way to turn 
on and off guides, grids, 
indicators, and other 
hidden elements.

L
11 With the coffee cup image still selected, choose Edit > Copy. Click the Plan mode 
link, and double-click the MasterFlash page thumbnail to open the page.
12 Choose Edit > Paste In Place, then File > Close Page.
The coffee cup image should paste in the same position on the page and be a 
footer item.
13 With the A-Master page showing in Design mode, click the Preview mode link 
to preview the glow effect (you may need to scroll down). Click the Design 
mode link to return to the A-Master page.
14 Choose Edit > Deselect All, if necessary.
15 Choose File > Save Site, leave the A-Master page open.
adjusting opacity
Another great feature for adding design interest to your pages is the ability to 
change the opacity (transparency) of content. You can use opacity changes to aid in 
readability when placing text on an image, for instance.
In this exercise, you’ll place text on an image and insert a rectangle frame between 
the image and the text for readability.
1 Click the Plan mode link, then double-click the PRODUCTS page thumbnail to 
open the page in Design mode. Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
2 Choose File > Place. In the Import dialog box, navigate to the images folder 
in the Lessons folder. Select the image named Origins.jpg, and click Open 
(Windows) or Select (Mac OS).
3 Click to place the upper-left corner of the image in the upper-left corner of the 
page area.
Red Smart Guides will appear on the left and top edges of the page area if the 
image is snapped to the page edge.
4 Open the Transform panel (Window > Transform). Hold down the Control 
(Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key and drag the bottom-middle bounding 
point of the image frame up until the Height setting in the Transform panel 
shows 150.
P Note: If your screen 
resolution allows it, you 
may see the X, Y, W, H, 
and rotation options 
that you see in the 
Transform panel in the 
Control panel as well.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 199
5 Select the Rectangle tool in the Toolbox, and draw a frame on top of the new 
image that stretches from the left edge of the page area to the right edge of the 
page area and has a height of approximately 70px. Don’t worry about its exact 
vertical position right now, as you will change it later.
6 Change the Fill color of the frame to the red color swatch with the values R: 193, 
G: 39, B: 45. Change Stroke Weight to 0 in the Control panel as well.
7 Change the Opacity setting to 60 in the Control panel.
Opacity changes the transparency of the selected object. If the rectangle you 
drew had a background image, stroke, and so on, the opacity adjustment would 
apply to the frame and all of its contents.
8 Select the Text tool, and draw a text frame whose left edge aligns with the 
left edge of the first column guides, on top of the red-filled frame. Type OUR 
PRODUCTS. Don’t worry about the vertical position of the text frame.
9 Select the text and change the Font to News Gothic Std Medium in the System 
Fonts section of the Fonts menu, the Font Size to 36, and the text color to White.
10 Select the Selection tool, and position the red rectangle and the text frame like 
you see in the figure.
11 Click the Preview mode link to preview the changes. Click the Design mode link 
to return to the PRODUCTS page.
12 Choose File > Save Site, then choose File > Close Page to close the page and 
return to the A-Master page in Design mode.
E Tip: To change the 
opacity, click Opacity in 
the Control panel and 
then adjust the drop-
down slider or type the 
value directly in the 
Opacity field.
P Note: If you are on 
Windows, choose News 
Gothic Std for the font.

L
Working with graphic styles
Just as you use paragraph and character styles to quickly format text, you can 
use graphic styles to quickly format graphics and frames. Object styles include set-
tings for stroke, fill color, effects, wrap, and more, but do not contain text formatting. 
If you work in Adobe InDesign, you’re probably familiar with Object styles. Object 
styles in InDesign are very similar in basic functionality to Graphic styles in Muse.
In Muse, graphic styles are used for formatting submenus, image frames, and 
tooltips, as well as much more.
1 Click the Graphic Styles panel tab on the right side of the workspace.
Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the options in the Graphic Styles 
panel. As you progress through this exercise, you will learn about each of 
these options.

Creating and applying a graphic style
In Lesson 3, “Working with Master Pages,” when you inserted the menu widget, you 
styled the submenu for the PRODUCTS parent page. Later, you added several sub-
pages to THE KOFFEE page. Unfortunately, the new submenu that was created had 
the default styling. To style the new submenu, you will create a graphic style.
1 On the A-Master page, choose View > Fit Page In Window, and then scroll to 
the top of the page so that you can see the menu.
2 With the Selection tool, click twice on the PRODUCTS menu item to show the 
submenu, if necessary. Click the Coffee submenu item twice to select it. The 
words “Menu Item” should appear in the Selection Indicator on the left end of 
the Control panel.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 201
3 With the Graphic Styles panel showing, click the Create A New Style button (
) 
at the bottom of the panel to create a new graphic style based on the submenu 
item formatting.
4 Double-click the new graphic 
style named Style. Change the 
Style Name to Submenu, and 
notice all of the formatting 
that was captured in the 
Style Setting area of the Style 
Options dialog box. Click OK.
Next, you will create a 
paragraph style to make sure 
that the text in both submenus has the same formatting (remember, graphic 
styles do not contain text formatting). Then you will apply the graphic style.
5 With the PRODUCTS submenu showing already and the Coffee submenu item 
selected, click on the Coffee menu item to select the text frame.
6 In the Paragraph Styles panel, click the Create A New Style button (
) at the 
bottom of the panel. Double-click the new style named Paragraph Style, and 
change the name to Submenu in the Style Options dialog box. Click OK.
7 Click THE KOFFEE menu item until the submenu appears. Click the Preparation 
submenu item twice to select it. The words “Menu Item” will appear on the left 
end of the Control panel.
8 Click the Submenu graphic style in the Graphic Styles panel to apply the 
formatting to both submenu items.
Graphic styles cannot contain formatting like sizes of objects (width and 
height), text formatting, and more, so this submenu won’t look exactly like the 
other submenu.
P Note: The submenus 
you see may look 
different than those in 
the figure and that’s 
okay—as long as the 
Normal state is selected 
in the States panel.
P Note: Be careful not 
to click a graphic style 
in the Graphic Styles 
panel with nothing 
selected. The graphic 
style will actually apply 
to the page area. If you 
accidentally do this, you 
can select the graphic 
style named [None] to 
remove the formatting.

L
finish the submenu formatting
Because graphic styles don’t capture text formatting, sizes, and more, you will need 
to finish formatting the submenus using text styles and other options.
1 With the Preparation menu item still selected, change the Height in the 
Transform panel or Control panel to 30. Select the Origins submenu item, and 
change its Height to 30 as well.
2 Click the Preparation submenu item twice to select the text frame. The words 
“Text Frame” appear in the Control panel.
3 Click the Submenu paragraph style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply it to 
the text for both submenu items. This occurs because the Edit Together option is 
selected in the Menu options for the menu widget.
4 Press the Escape key to select the Preparation menu item.
5 In the States panel, select Rollover and click the Reset To Default button (
) at 
the bottom of the panel.
6 Change the text color in the Text panel to the orange color with the tooltip that 
shows R=251 B=176 G=59.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 203
7 Select the Active (Normal) state in the States panel, and click the Reset To 
Default button to match the appearance of the Normal state.
8 Change the text color in the Text panel to the orange color with the tooltip that 
shows R=251 B=176 G=59.
9 Click the Origins submenu item to select it. The words “Menu Item” will appear 
in the Control panel.
10 Repeat steps 2 through 8 for the Origins submenu item and text. When you are 
finished applying the formatting to the Origins submenu item, make sure that 
Normal is selected in the States panel before you move on.
11 Click the Preview mode link, and position the pointer over the PRODUCTS and 
THE KOFFEE menu items to see the submenus. Click the Design link to return 
to the A-Master page in Design mode.
12 Choose File > Save Site.
Clearing overrides and editing a graphic style
In Muse, updating a graphic style is accomplished by redefining that style. To rede-
fine a style, you edit the formatting for an object on the page that has that graphic 
style applied. Then you redefine the style based on the changes. This makes the 
graphic style match the new settings, and all other objects with that style applied 
automatically update to match.
1 On the A-Master page, choose Edit > Deselect All, if necessary.
2 With the Selection tool, click twice on the PRODUCTS menu item to show the 
submenu, if necessary. Click twice on the Coffee submenu item to select it.
3 Change the Fill color in the Control panel to Black.

L
4 In the Graphic Styles panel, notice that the Submenu style has a plus (+) to the 
right of the name. Position the pointer over the Submenu style name. In the 
tooltip that appears, below the dotted line, you will see the local formatting 
options (formatting that is applied to the selected content that is different from 
the graphic style).
5 Click the Clear Style Overrides button (
) at the bottom of the Graphic Styles 
panel to remove the fill color override.
Next you will redefine the graphic style formatting.
6 With the Coffee submenu item still selected, change the Fill color in the Control 
panel to Footer Stroke.
7 In the Graphic Styles panel, the Submenu style has a plus (+) to the right of the 
name again. This time you will redefine the style.
8 Click the Redefine Style button (
) at the bottom of the panel.
9 Click the Preview mode link, and position the pointer over the PRODUCTS and 
THE KOFFEE menu items to see the submenus. Click the Design link to return 
to the A-Master page in Design mode.
The last step is to copy this menu to the MasterFlash master page so that the 
menus are the same.
10 Choose Edit > Deselect All. Click to select the menu with the Selection tool, and 
choose Edit > Copy.
P Note: The styling 
options you see may be 
in a different order than 
in the figure and that’s 
okay.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 205
11 Click the Plan mode link, and double-click the MasterFlash thumbnail to open 
the page in Design mode.
12 With the Selection tool, click to select the menu in the header. Press Delete or 
Backspace to remove it.
13 Choose Edit > Paste In Place to paste the menu onto the MasterFlash page.
14 Choose File > Save Site and File > Close Page to close the MasterFlash master 
page. Choose File > Close Page to close the A-Master page as well and return to 
Plan mode.
Graphic style extras
Graphic styles have many of the same options that paragraph and character styles 
have, including deleting, duplicating, and unlinking. To access most of these 
options, in the Graphic Styles panel, you can right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac OS) a style name and make a selection in the context menu that appears.
Deleting a graphic style removes it from the list. If it is applied to content in your 
site, a dialog box will appear asking you to replace the graphic style with another.
Duplicating a graphic style makes an exact copy of the style.
Unlinking a graphic style from selected content is useful if you want to create a 
style similar to another style or apply a style, but don’t want the formatting of that 
content to change when the graphic style updates. You can unlink selected content 
from a graphic style by clicking the Unlink Style From Selection button (
) at 
the bottom of the Graphic Styles panel or choosing it from the context menu as 
explained above.
embedding htML
In Muse, you can incorporate source code content generated by a number of dif-
ferent websites such as a map from Google, a YouTube video, Flickr content, or an 
Adobe FormsCentral form. You simply copy and paste the code from those sites 
and then embed that HTML into your pages. Embedding HTML into a Muse page 
is like putting a window inside a page on your site that displays the content of a 
third-party site.
Embedded HTML is a great way to add complex information (such as maps, con-
tact forms, weather forecasts) as well as rich media (like videos, slideshows, and 
audio files) quickly and easily to your Muse site.
Although embedding HTML has limitless uses, in this section, you will focus on 
one: inserting a Google map. For ideas on inserting video from YouTube, adding a 
contact form, adding a bullet list, and more, see the sidebar at the end of this sec-
tion titled “More embedding HTML examples.”

L
adding a Google map
To practice embedding HTML content into your pages, in this exercise you will 
insert a Google map that shows the location of Kevin’s Koffee Kart.
1 In Plan mode, double-click the KART MAP page thumbnail to open the page in 
Design mode.
2 Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
3 Choose File > Preview Page In Browser. In the browser window that opens, type 
maps.google.com in the navigation bar to visit the page.
4 Type Dog Park, Berry Street, San Francisco, CA in the search field toward the 
top of the maps.google.com page. Click the Search Maps button.
5 Click the Link button (
) on the left side of the maps.google.com page. In the 
options box that appears, click the text link “Customize and preview embedded 
map.”
Your browser opens a new page where you can customize the size of the map 
before you copy the code to embed the map into Muse.
6 Toward the top of the new Google Maps page, select Custom under the Map 
Size options, then change Width to 850 and Height to 600.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 207
7 At the bottom of the page, select all of the code, and then copy it by pressing 
Control+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac OS) or by choosing copy from 
the menu. Close the browser window with the map options, but leave the maps.
google.com page open.
8 Return to Muse, and choose Object > Insert HTML. In the HTML Code 
dialog box, delete the sentence “Insert your HTML here.” With the cursor in 
the dialog box right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) in the HTML 
Code dialog box, then choose Paste from the context menu that appears. 
Click OK. A map appears.
9 With the Selection tool, drag the map from the upper-left corner to align with 
the left edge of the first column and a little down from the top margin guide. 
See the figure for placement help.
Notice that when you position the pointer over the map frame, that an icon (
) 
appears off the upper-left corner of the frame. This icon indicates that the 
content in the frame contains embedded HTML.
E Tip: You can also 
paste HTML code 
directly into the page. 
Muse detects HTML 
source tags and will 
automatically paste the 
code as HTML into the 
page.

L
When you insert HTML into Muse, the live content will appear in Design mode 
in most cases, but it won’t be interactive until you preview the page. Also, Muse 
places the HTML content into a frame that is the width of a single column. The 
width of the frame has no bearing on the HTML content.
10 Choose Object > Send To Back.
11 With the map frame selected, open the Transform panel and change the width 
to 850 and the height to 600.
You don’t have to do this, but you will apply a stroke to the frame and want it to 
show around the edges of the map.
P Note: You can apply certain formatting options like fill and stroke, as well as background images 
to the frame that the HTML is in, but other options like rounded corners will not work properly, and 
you cannot apply effects.
12 Change Stroke Weight to 3 and the stroke color to a medium gray in the 
Control panel.
13 With the Selection tool, drag the CLICK TO GET DIRECTIONS! button down 
to cover the bottom of the map, directly over the View Larger Map link to cover 
it up. You will remove that link later.
14 Select the Text tool, draw a frame at the top of the first column, and type 
KART MAP. Open the Paragraph Styles panel (Window > Paragraph Styles), 
and click the Heading style to apply it.
15 Click the Preview mode link to see the map, and try interacting with the map. 
Click the Design mode link to return to the KART MAP page.
P Note: If you paste 
the code into the page, 
like the previous Tip 
mentions, the frame 
that the map is placed 
into is the same size as 
the map.
P Note: You may need 
to drag the Bottom 
of Page guide down 
to give a little room 
between the blue 
button bar and the 
footer content.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 209
More embedding HTML examples
Embedding HTML has the added benefit of enabling you to use a third-party’s 
site as a hosting service and uploading interface. For example, if you create a free 
account with YouTube, you can create your own YouTube channel and upload the 
video content from your site. YouTube includes a web page that simplifies the 
upload process and hosts the video files on their site. When you want to update 
your site, simply add more videos to your YouTube channel, copy the embed code, 
and then paste it into a page to add new videos to your Muse site.
Adding YouTube video to pages in Muse is just one example of the many uses for 
embedding HTML code into your Muse pages. To learn how to insert some of the 
most widely used social media, video, and other features into your pages, check out 
the PDF named AppA_MuseCIB.pdf on the Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book disc.
In that PDF, you will explore other options for embedding HTML code, including
•
Adding Google driving directions
•
Inserting a Twitter feed
•
Inserting a numbered or bulleted list
•
Adding video from YouTube
Editing the embedded HTML
After you embed the HTML content, you can either delete the frame to delete the 
HTML content, or you can edit the HTML if you want to make changes or replace it.
1 With the Selection tool, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the 
map frame. Choose HTML… from the context menu that appears.
In the HTML Code dialog box, you can edit the code directly, or you can return 
to maps.google.com and repeat the process for getting the code, changing the 
size of the map in the process.
2 In the beginning of the code, find the line height="600" and change it to 
height="580" instead. Also, to remove that link you covered up on the bottom 
of the map, find the </iframe> tag. Delete all of the code after that tag, starting 
with <br/><small>, to the end of the code. Click OK.
E Tip: You can also 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
in the HTML Code 
dialog box and choose 
commands like Select 
All or Paste from the 
context menu that 
appears.

L
After a few seconds, the map should update to show the new height. You may 
need to move the blue button up to cover the bottom of the map.
3 Return to the maps.google.com browser window, and click the Link button. In 
the link options that are still showing, click the text link below Short URL and 
copy the text.
For a last enhancement, you are getting a link from maps.google.com to apply to 
the blue button so visitors can go directly to maps.google.com if they like.
4 Return to Muse. With the Selection tool, select the blue CLICK TO GET 
DIRECTIONS! button. In the Hyperlinks field, select KART MAP and paste the 
link you copied from maps.google.com. Press Enter or Return.
5 Click the Preview mode link to see the map, and click the blue button to visit 
maps.google.com. Click the Design mode link to return to the KART MAP page.
6 Choose File > Save Site and close all open pages.
In Lesson 9, “Working with Widgets,” you’ll see how to add some really cool 
interactive features to your pages, such as lightboxes and slideshows, tabbed panel 
systems, and sliding panels.

review answers
1 The three main effects that you can apply to content in Muse are shadows, bevels, 
and glows.
2 You can apply effects to selected content by clicking the Effects link in the Control 
panel, selecting the desired effects, and setting the options in the options box 
that appears.
3 Just as you use paragraph and character styles to quickly format text, you can use 
graphic styles to quickly format graphics and frames. Graphic styles include settings 
for stroke, fill color, effects, wrap, and more.
4 In Muse, updating a graphic style is accomplished by redefining that style. To redefine 
a style, you edit the formatting for the object on the page that has a graphic style 
applied. Then you redefine the style based on the changes. This makes the graphic 
style match the new settings, and all other objects with that style applied automatically 
update to match.
5 You can insert HTML source code generated by a third-party website by copying the 
source code from the original website, choosing Object > Insert HTML, pasting the 
code into the dialog box that appears, then clicking OK.

Muse provides an easy way to add powerful inter-
activity to your pages in the form of widgets. In this 
lesson, you’ll explore various widget types, such as 
compositions and slideshows, and see how easily you 
can customize them.

214 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
about widgets
On the Web these days, you see all sorts of cool, interactive content like slide-
shows that cycle through larger images, and much more. You may have even heard 
of jQuery or Adobe Spry, the behind-the-scenes technologies that power these 
advanced features. Muse provides much of the same interactive functionality in the 
form of widgets. Widgets are reusable building blocks of interactivity and behavior 
that are completely customizable and that you can simply drag onto your pages—all 
the power without the programming.
Muse groups widgets into four categories in the 
Widgets Library panel (Window > Widgets Library): 
Compositions, Menus, Panels, and Slideshows. Each 
provides an easy way of adding interactivity to your 
web pages.
P Note: See Lesson 3, “Working with Master Pages,” for more 
information on working with menus.
Although each category has specific controls, the 
overall procedure of adding a widget to your page is 
the same for all types:
1
Open the Widgets Library panel.
2
Drag the desired widget onto your page.
3
Edit the widget (change its options, format the widget, and style the 
appearance).
4 Add content to the widget.
To better match your design process, you can even change the order of steps 3 
and 4.
More widget examples
In this lesson, you will insert two widgets. To learn about the other widgets in 
each category, check out the PDF named AppB_MuseCIB.pdf on the Adobe Muse 
Classroom in a Book disc.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.
P Note: The exercises 
in this lesson, like others 
in this book, require 
that you have the 
fonts supplied on the 
Adobe Muse Classroom 
in a Book disc installed 
on your machine. For 
more information on 
installing the necessary 
fonts, see “Fonts used in 
this book” on page 2 of 
“Getting Started.”

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 215
Inserting a composition widget
The Widgets Library panel offers five composition widgets: Blank, Featured News, 
Lightbox Display, Presentation, and Tooltip. Each has the same options available, 
but has different options set, so that you can customize the widget’s action. All five 
widgets, however, are comprised of at least one small container (the trigger) that dis-
plays content in a larger content area (the target) in response to visitor interaction.
Triggers
Targets (also called larger content areas) are stacked  
on each other by default, but in this illustration,  
the targets are staggered so you can see them.
Composition widgets can have trigger content that is different from the target 
content, and they’re not limited to displaying images. You could list a recipe that 
contains a trigger in the text. When the visitor clicks the trigger phrase “cube the 
potatoes,” for example, an image with text and even a video could appear in the 
larger content area, providing hints on uniformly cubing potatoes.
In composition widgets, you can move the larger content areas independently of 
each other. You can stack them on one another, so only one at a time is seen as in 
an image slideshow (the default), or you can scatter them around the page so that 
you can see more than one at a time, like in a tooltip that displays content next to 
the cursor on a page.
In this section, you will insert and edit the Lightbox Display composition widget, 
which will give you a feel for working with a composition widget.
P Note: The Tooltip 
Composition widget 
has the targets set to be 
staggered by default.

216 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
Inserting a Lightbox Display composition widget
A Lightbox Display widget dims the rest of the page while the content area element 
display is active. Like other composition widgets, it can show and hide text, images, 
and more. Using a Lightbox Display widget can be a great way to show other content 
without forcing the visitor to go to another page or to reload the same page.
In this section, you will insert a Lightbox Display widget to show social media links 
that visitors can click to see Kevin’s Twitter content, Facebook page, and more.
1 In Plan mode with the KevinsKoffeeKart site open, double-click the A-Master 
page thumbnail to open the page in Design mode. Choose View > Fit Page In 
Window.
2 Select the Selection tool, if it’s not already selected. In the Widgets Library 
panel, double-click the Compositions category to display that category’s 
widgets. Click Lightbox Display to see a preview at the top of the panel. Drag 
the widget from the Widgets Library panel into the page.
E Tip: You can also insert a composition widget by choosing Object > Insert Composition > 
[specific widget you need].
P Note: If you are 
starting from scratch 
using the Jumpstart 
method described 
in the “Jumpstart” 
section on page 5 of 
“Getting Started,” your 
workspace may look 
different than the 
figures you see in this 
lesson.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 217
3 Drag the Lightbox Display widget down the page a bit until it overlaps the 
footer.
You may need to scroll down to see, but notice how the footer doesn’t move 
down to accommodate the larger content area of the widget (the black rectangle 
with the image in it). The footer doesn’t need to move because the content area 
is hidden when the page displays in the browser; it appears only when you click 
one of the small gray trigger rectangles.
4 Drag the lightbox up until it mostly fits in the page area and leave the widget 
selected. The word “Widget” appears in the Selection Indicator on the left end 
of the Control panel to tell you that the widget is selected.
P Note: The selected widget has eight points around the widget container, which in Muse usually 
means that you can resize something, but that’s not the case for Composition or Slideshow widgets. 
Here, they have no function.
5 Click the Preview mode link to test the widget. Notice that the larger content 
area that contains the big images is hidden to start. Click one of the gray trigger 
rectangles to show the lightbox content area. Also, notice that when you position 
the pointer over each of the three triggers, they change to a darker gray color.
When the content area appears with the larger image and the rest of the page 
is dimmed, you can click the arrows left or right to show the previous or next 
images. Also notice the caption beneath each image, both images and captions 
are only placeholders at the moment. You can change or hide these later, like 
most everything in the widget.
6 Click the Design mode link to return to the A-Master page.
7 Choose File > Save Site.
Editing composition widget options
After inserting any widget, you can edit its options, which allow you to turn on and 
off widget features, as well as customize the widget’s actions. All composition wid-
gets offer the same group of options for you to edit, but each has them set slightly 
differently to suit the widget’s specific purpose. These settings are simply a starting 
point, however. You can further customize a composition widget’s function as well 
as its content and appearance to suit your needs.
Next, you will edit the options for the Lightbox Display widget.

218 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
1 Choose Edit > Deselect All, then click the widget to select it. You may need 
to zoom out for the next steps. Click the editing options icon (white arrow in 
the blue circle) and make the following changes in the widget Options menu 
that appears:
•
Position: Lightbox (the default setting)
•
Event: On Click (the default setting)
•
Transition: Fading (the default setting)
•
Speed: Medium
•
Auto Play: None (the default setting)
•
Triggers On Top: Deselected (the default setting)
•
Hide All Initially: Selected
•
Prev and Next: Deselected (this removes the arrows from the lightbox)
•
Close Button: Deselected (the default setting)
•
Show Lightbox Parts While Editing: Selected (the default setting)
•
Show All in Design Mode: Deselected (the default setting)
2 Press the Escape key to hide the widget Options menu, and choose 
File > Save Site.
E Tip: The Prev (previous) and Next buttons are each embedded images in their own container. 
If you chose to keep them showing in the options for the widget, you can add text, replace the 
image, or add another type of content to the container using design features in Muse.
P Note: To learn 
more about each 
Composition widget 
option, check out 
the PDF named 
AppB_MuseCIB.pdf 
on the Adobe Muse 
Classroom in a Book disc.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 219
Adding or deleting a trigger
When you drag a Lightbox Display widget onto your page, it includes three triggers 
(the small gray boxes) that when clicked, show one of three large target areas. Each 
gray trigger container can contain text, images, and more. The larger target areas 
are stacked on top of each other by default, so it looks like there’s only one.
Next, you will add and remove triggers. When you add or remove a trigger, its asso-
ciated target area is also added or removed (along with the content in it).
1 With the Selection tool, click the small, gray trigger rectangles, one at a time, to 
see each associated target area and its content.
In Design mode, the widgets will work, but with limited functionality.
2 Click the plus (+) icon that appears to the right of the trigger elements to add 
another trigger and blank target area.
3 Click the newly added trigger to select it (if it’s not already selected), and press 
Delete or Backspace to remove the trigger and the associated content area.
4 Click twice on the third trigger from the left to select it. Position the pointer 
over the selected trigger, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS), and 
choose Delete Element.
Two small triggers remain.
E Tip: You can also 
position the pointer 
over any of the triggers, 
right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) 
on the trigger, and 
choose Insert Element 
to add another trigger 
and target.

220 
Lesson 9 Working with Widgets
5 Using either of the previous methods, delete the trigger on the right, leaving one 
trigger and one target area.
Each trigger and target area can contain content and have formatting applied. In 
the following sections, you will edit the trigger and target areas. If you had more 
than one trigger and target area, you would repeat the steps for each, even creat-
ing graphic styles and text styles to make it easier to ensure consistent design 
formatting.
Editing a trigger
The triggers in a Composition widget can contain backgrounds, text, images, 
effects, and more. Each trigger is a container that can contain other content. In 
addition, triggers can show interaction by changing the appearance of the different 
states in the States panel.
You are going to insert a Photoshop button into the trigger so that it will change 
appearance when the visitor interacts with it.
1 Choose File > Place Photoshop Button. Navigate to the images folder in the 
Lessons folder and select the image file named btn_share.psd. Click Open 
(Windows) or Select (Mac OS). Click OK in the Photoshop Import Options 
(btn_share.psd) dialog box.
2 Position the Place Gun over the small, gray trigger at the top of the widget and 
the edges will show a blue highlight. Click to insert the button into the trigger 
rectangle.
As you remember from placing a Photoshop button during Lesson 7, layers in 
the Photoshop file become states in the button in Muse if they are present and 
named properly in the .psd. Notice also that the trigger container grows to fit 

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 221
the button. The trigger container will grow to fit any content changes you make 
going forward. You can add text, images, and more to the trigger container, for 
instance, by either dragging that content into the trigger container or drawing 
a text frame in the container.
3 With the Selection tool, click three times on the Share button image to select it.
With the image selected, you will see Rectangle in the Selection Indicator on the 
left end of the Control panel.
4 Press the Right Arrow key several times to move the image in the trigger 
container until it’s roughly in the center horizontally.
The trigger container (gray box) is the link area that the visitor will click.
5 Press the Escape key to select the trigger container, not the button image. Open 
the States panel (Window > States).
Each state in a trigger has a background color and no stroke. You can select 
each state, like you’ve done before, and edit the appearance of the trigger. With 
each trigger, you could simply add a text frame and leave it at that, insert a 
background image that changes with each state, and more.
6 With the Normal state selected in the States panel, click the Fill color in the 
Control panel and choose [None] from the Color Picker.
7 Click the Rollover state, and click the Reset To Default button (
) at the bottom 
of the States panel.
P Note: You could 
also select the trigger 
container (not the 
image) and resize it 
to match the content 
inside (in this case the 
Photoshop button).

222 
Lesson 9 Working with Widgets
8 Zoom out by choosing View > Zoom Out several times, if necessary, so that you 
can see the entire header area.
9 With the Selection tool, drag the trigger up into the right end of the header, 
above the page area. See the figure for placement help.
10 Click the Preview mode link to test the widget. Click the Design mode link to 
return to the page.
11 Choose File > Save Site and leave the page open.
Adding content to a target area
Now that the trigger is complete, you can focus on the larger content area for that 
trigger. The content area is where the main content appears. You can add text, 
images, or any other type of content using Muse’s design features by drawing 
frames or rectangles within the bounds of the content area or dragging content 
into area.
1 Click away from the widget on the page to deselect it. Click twice on the larger 
content area to select it.
The word “Container” appears in the Selection Indicator on the left end of the 
Control panel. The black rectangle is selected behind the default image. That 
rectangle covers or dims the web page and displays the target content (the 
image and text) in a spotlight (also called a lightbox) drawing the user’s focus to 
the displayed content. When you edited the widget options, if you had selected 
an option other than Lightbox for Position, the black rectangle wouldn’t show.
P Note: When you 
click away from content 
in the page area, you 
deselect that content 
but wind up selecting 
the page. Be careful 
when making changes 
at that point, because it 
would affect the page.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 223
2 Click the Fill link in the Control panel, and change Opacity to 30. Press Return 
and then press the Escape key to hide the Fill options.
3 Click the Preview mode link, click the Share image in the trigger to test 
the widget, and notice that the rectangle behind the target content is more 
transparent. Click the Design mode link to return to the page.
4 Click the larger content area once more to select the container within.
This selects another container that by default contains an image and a 
text frame.
5 Click once more on the text frame that contains [Lorum Ipsum…], and press 
Delete or Backspace to delete it.
6 Click four times on the large image until Image Frame shows in the Selection 
Indicator on the left end of the Control panel, and press Delete or Backspace to 
delete the image as well.
This removes the container that the image and text were in. You can create, 
paste, place, or drag other content into that area, however, and Muse will create 
a new content container for the trigger.
7 Choose File > Open Site. In the Lesson09 folder in the Lessons folder, select the 
Muse file named Lightbox.muse. Click Open (Windows) or Select (Mac OS). 
In Plan mode, double-click the Home page thumbnail to open the page in 
Design mode.
8 Choose Edit > Select All, then Edit > Copy.
9 Close the Lightbox.muse site by choosing File > Close Site.
E Tip: You could 
change the fill of the 
container to include 
a different color, a 
gradient, or even a 
background image. 
Just make sure that 
the background isn’t 
too busy and that the 
lightbox content is 
readable.

224 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
10 Back in the A-Master page, choose Edit > Paste. With the Selection tool, drag the 
group into the larger content area. When the container shows a blue highlight 
around the edge, release. Position the group like you see in the figure.
At this point, you could click again on the group you pasted to edit content 
within that group if necessary. You could also create more content in the larger 
content area or drag other content in as well.
11 Press the Escape key once to select the container that holds the group.
12 Click the Fill Color in the Control panel, and change the fill color of the 
container to white in the Color Picker. Press the Escape key to hide the 
Color Picker.
13 With the Selection tool, drag the bottom, middle point of the container up to a 
height of approximately 265px.
14 Choose View > Fit Page In Window. Drag the container so that it is approxi-
mately centered horizontally and vertically in the page area. You can tell when 
it is centered horizontally because a vertical red Smart Guide appears in the 
middle. You can tell when it’s centered vertically in the page area when the gap 
measurements show the same values on top and bottom.
P Note: You can tell 
when content is a part 
of a widget because 
when it’s selected, like 
the group you just 
pasted, the white arrow 
in the blue circle for the 
options appears off the 
upper-right corner of 
the content.
E Tip: You could 
apply rounded corners, 
effects, and more to the 
container if you like.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 225
15 With the container selected, click the editing options icon (white arrow in the 
blue circle). When the Widget Options menu appears, deselect Show Lightbox 
Parts While Editing. Because this widget is on a master page, you need to hide 
the larger content area so that it doesn’t show on each page with the master 
applied in Design mode. Press the Escape key to hide the widget Options menu.
16 Click the Preview mode link to test the widget by clicking the SHARE 
button. Click the Design mode link to return to the page.
17 Click the SHARE button in the header to select the widget. Choose Edit > 
Copy. Click the Plan mode link, and double-click the MasterFlash thumbnail 
to open the master page in Design mode. Choose Edit > Paste In Place to paste 
the entire widget onto the MasterFlash page.
18 Close all open pages and return to Plan mode. Choose File > Save Site.
P Note: Your gap 
measurements may not 
be the same as in the 
figure and that’s okay.

lesson 9 Working with Widgets
Working with slideshows
Slideshow widgets are a great way to add robust image slideshows to your pages 
and are what you typically see on the Web these days.
Muse offers four slideshow widgets: Basic, Blank, Lightbox, and Thumbnails. Each 
has different options set to create a specialized configuration, but all have the same 
options available. You can explore each slideshow configuration to discover which 
works best for your project.
Slideshow widgets are different from composition widgets because they can con-
tain only images and they have a caption, first and last buttons, as well as thumb-
nails that can be shown or hidden for each larger image. The larger content areas 
must be stacked, showing one at a time (unlike composition widgets).
In this section, you will insert a Blank slideshow widget.
adding a thumbnails  
slideshow widget
In the next section, you’ll insert a Blank Slideshow widget, which represents one 
type of simple slideshow. To learn how to insert and edit a Thumbnails slideshow 
widget, check out the section “Adding a Thumbnails slideshow widget” in the PDF 
named AppB_MuseCIB.pdf on the Adobe Muse Classroom in a Book disc.
adding a Blank slideshow widget
A Blank slideshow widget is one of the simplest slideshows and contains only one 
larger content area (target area) without any triggers showing. By default, there is 
a previous and next arrow that allows the visitor to cycle between the images.
1 In Plan mode, double-click the HOME page thumbnail to open that page 
in Design mode. Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
2 In the Widgets Library panel, double-click the Slideshows category to show the 
slideshow widgets. Drag the Blank slideshow widget into the middle of the page. 
Leave the widget selected; you’ll reposition it later in the lesson.
E Tip: You can also 
insert a Slideshow 
widget by choosing 
Object > Insert 
Slideshow > [specific 
widget you need].

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 227
3 Choose File > Save Site.
edit slideshow widget options
After inserting any widget, you can edit the widget options specific to the slideshow 
widgets. Next, you will edit the options for the Blank slideshow widget.
1 With the widget still selected, click the editing options icon (white arrow in 
the blue circle). In the widget Options menu that appears, set New Hero to Fill 
Frame Proportionally.
The Hero is the image in the larger content area.
By setting this first, images you add to the slideshow will fill the larger content 
area, ensuring that there are no gaps and that a portion of the image is 
cropped. If the image frame is resized later, the image will always fill the frame 
proportionally.
2 Still in the widget Options menu, click the Add Images folder icon. Open the 
Lessons > images > _widgets folder. Click the image named KoffeeKart_HP_
Hero_01.jpg, press and hold down the Shift key, and click the image named 

228 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
KoffeeKart_HP_Hero_04.jpg, to select four images. Click Open (Windows) or 
Select (Mac OS). The images are loaded into the slideshow and you see only one 
on the page.
3 Continuing in the widget Options menu, ensure the following options are set 
accordingly:
•
Transition: Fade (the default setting)
•
Auto Play: Slow
•
New Hero: Fill Frame Proportionally (you set this previously)
•
New Thumbnail: Fill Frame Proportionally (the default setting)
There are no thumbnails showing in the Blank Slideshow widget by default, 
so this won’t have any bearing right now.
•
Lightbox: Deselected (the default setting)
Selecting the Lightbox option would hide the larger content areas initially, as 
with the composition Lightbox widget.
•
Prev, Next, and Counter: Deselected
•
Captions: Selected (the default setting)
•
Thumbnails: Selected
You will hide the thumbnails later, but will use them to show each image and 
change its caption.
•
Editing options: Both selected (the default setting)
This will hide all of the slideshow parts except for the larger content areas and 
the captions.
4 Press the Escape key to hide the widget options.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 229
editing the appearance of the Blank slideshow widget
Slideshow widgets can have all sorts of formatting options applied to the triggers 
and the larger content areas (targets), just like the other widgets. In this section, 
you will resize the larger images, then edit and style the captions.
1 With the Selection tool, drag the entire widget into the upper-left corner of the 
page area until it snaps. Choose Object > Send To Back to arrange it behind the 
content already on the page.
2 Click once more on the large image (the content area) to select the image frame. 
With the Selection tool, drag the lower-right bounding point down and to the 
right until it snaps into the lower-right corner of the page area. You may need to 
zoom out.
The image now covers the page area and the measurement label shows 100%. 
Each image will fill the image frame automatically, without distorting. When the 
images were created in a program like Photoshop, they were sized to match the 
page area (960 pixels wide by 640 pixels in height).
E Tip: You can also change the dimensions of the image frame using the Transform panel, or if 
your screen resolution allows it, the Width and Height options in the Control panel.
3 With the Selection tool, click to select the caption. Drag it so that it snaps 
into the upper-left corner of the first column. Click and drag the right-middle 
bounding point to snap to the right edge of the second column.
P Note: Currently, 
in Muse content 
associated with the 
footer is always behind 
content in the page 
area.
P Note: You can 
change the formatting 
of the image frame, 
including background 
fill, stroke, rounded 
corners, effects, and 
more.

230 
lesson 9 Working with Widgets
4 Click the green image thumbnail to show the larger image and caption.
5 Click to select the caption text frame. In the Text panel, change the font to the 
web safe font Lucida Sans, the font size to 34, and the color to white.
6 Select the Text tool, and change the text to Get FREE pastry on Tuesday with 
coffee purchase.
7 Click the second blue thumbnail to show the larger content area caption. 
Change the caption to Start each day with great coffee.
8 Click the third yellow/orange thumbnail to show the larger content area caption. 
Change the caption to Coffee is Art.
9 Click the fourth blue thumbnail (with the bike) to show the larger content area 
caption. Change the caption to Kevin’s commute.
10 With the caption still selected, click the editing options icon (white arrow in the 
blue circle) and deselect Thumbnails to hide them.
11 Click the Preview mode link to test the widget. Click the Design mode link to 
return to the page.
12 Choose File > Save Site, then File > Close Page.
Congratulations! You’ve finished your site and are now ready to publish the site 
content. Of course, you can always go back and practice adding and modifying con-
tent. In the next lesson, you will learn about publishing content to Adobe Business 
Catalyst and exporting site content to HTML.
E Tip: If you want to 
edit the larger images 
or the captions, you 
need to show either the 
Prev and Next arrows 
or the thumbnails, use 
them to cycle through 
the images, then hide 
them again.

review answers
1 Widgets are reusable building blocks of interactivity and behavior that allow visitors 
to click or hover (or auto-run) to show and hide content. They are completely 
customizable. Widgets provide an easy way of adding interactivity to your web page.
2 The four types of widgets available in Muse are: composition, menu, panel, and 
slideshow. Each of these categories offers multiple widgets, each customized for a 
specific purpose.
3 Widgets are comprised of at least one small container (the trigger) that displays 
content in a larger container (the target) in response to user interaction. Triggers can 
be hidden in certain widgets to have an auto-play widget.
4 A widget with Lightbox selected in the widget options dims the rest of the page while 
the element being displayed is active.
5 Slideshow widgets are different from composition widgets because they can contain 
only images, and they have a caption and first and last buttons, as well as thumbnails 
that can be shown or hidden for each larger image. The larger content areas must be 
stacked, showing one at a time (unlike composition widgets).

Muse offers two methods for publishing site content: 
Either publish directly from Muse to an Adobe 
Business Catalyst account, or use the File > Export As 
HTML command to create a local copy of all the files 
for your website, which you can then FTP up to the 
hosting provider of your choice.

234 
lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
understanding Muse publishing
After you’ve finished designing your site, the next step is to publish the site or 
export it as HTML using the File > Export As HTML command. If you want to 
publish the site for the world to see, you can publish directly to Business Catalyst 
hosting from within Muse. If you plan on using your own hosting provider or want 
to hand the site content off to someone else, you can export the site as HTML.
Using either method will generate HTML files, CSS, scripting, images, and other 
content necessary to make the site work in a browser. All of the .psd files in your 
Muse site will also be converted, at this point, to the best web format, depending 
on the image content.
excluding pages from export
When you publish your site or export as HTML, Muse exports all of the pages in 
your site map, even those that you’ve excluded from the navigation (such as the 
example project’s GALLERYb). If you are experimenting with a design, have a page 
containing an old product, or have an outdated sale page, you may not wish to 
export that page. To hold back pages that aren’t necessary, you can exclude them 
from export, specifying them either from Plan or Design mode. If you stop a page 
from exporting, none of the assets unique to that page export either. Assets, such as 
images, common to the excluded page and necessary pages do export.
Although clearing your site map of extraneous pages as you work is the best prac-
tice, excluding pages at the end of the process is simple.
P Note: If you are using the Jumpstart file (L10_start_mac.muse or L10_start_win.muse), you 
will see that the Appendix B exercises were fully explored and match the examples in Appendix B 
(AppB_MuseCIB.pdf).
1 With the KevinsKoffeeKart site open and in Plan mode, right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) the GALLERYb page thumbnail and choose Export Page 
to deselect the option.
When a check mark appears 
to the left of the Export Page 
command, then the page 
will export when you either 
publish or use the File > 
Export As HTML command.
P Note: The thumbnails you see in 
the figure may not match what you 
see, and that’s okay. 
2 Choose File > Save Site.
P Note: If you have 
not already done so, 
copy the Lessons 
folder onto your hard 
disk, from the Adobe 
Muse Classroom in a 
Book CD. See “Copying 
the Classroom in a Book 
files” on page 3.
P Note: The exercises 
in this lesson, like others 
in this book, require 
that you have the 
fonts supplied on the 
Adobe Muse Classroom 
in a Book disc installed 
on your machine. For 
more information on 
installing the necessary 
fonts, see “Fonts used in 
this book” on page 2.
P Note: You need 
to be careful when 
choosing which pages 
not to export. Suppose 
you choose to not 
export the KART MAP 
page that appears in the 
menu. The text “KART 
MAP” will still appear 
in the menu when the 
site is exported, but 
the page will not be 
present, so the link will 
not work.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 235
Publishing your site
Using Muse, you can create and publish an unlimited number of temporary sites. 
This is very convenient because you can upload in-progress sites to share with your 
clients. As you work with your client through the design and approval process, you 
can choose either to update the existing temporary site or to publish new tempo-
rary sites to compare several iterations. Some clients prefer to visit links to preview 
several different designs at once, so they can view them side by side during the 
approval process.
Each temporary site you create is active for 30 days. However, if a temporary site 
you are designing expires, you can extend it by simply opening the .muse file and 
publishing the site again. Using this strategy, you can keep working on a site and 
incorporating client feedback until the site design is deemed complete. Then you 
can upgrade and launch it.
After designing a site (even if it is not completely ready for primetime), you can 
publish it as a temporary site. Some web designers prefer to review the live sites in a 
browser this way, before showing their clients. All temporary sites are created using 
the site name of your choosing, followed by the Business Catalyst domain name. A 
temporary site’s URL will look something like http://my_site.businesscatalyst.com.
The publishing process itself is very easy and intuitive.
1 Click the Publish link in the upper-left corner of the Application window or 
choose File > Publish.
P Note: If you previously created a Business Catalyst account and used the same login e-mail to 
create your Adobe ID, the system will detect that the e-mail address you entered matches a record in 
the Business Catalyst database. When you log in via Publish or Manage from Muse for the first time 
using your Business Catalyst account information, you’ll see a dialog box that appears only once and 
that merges your Business Catalyst account with your Muse account when you enter your password. 

236 
lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
2 In Publish dialog box, enter a site name. When you publish this site as a 
temporary site for testing, this name will be a part of the initial URL. So, if 
you typed “KevinsKart” for instance, the URL for the temporary site would be 
kevinskart.businesscatalyst.com. Leave the Publish dialog box open.
The Starting Address is used only when you are testing your site. This will be 
the temporary address at which you can view the site in a browser or send to 
your clients for reviewing the site. You can change the address to something 
permanent later if you upgrade the site to a paid site. Business Catalyst checks 
the starting address to determine if it’s valid (it works) and if it’s available. If the 
name is not available, the field will update with an alternate suggestion. You do 
not have to use that suggestion, if you prefer to change the site name to another 
name that is not yet taken. Remember, this is just a URL for testing purposes.
3 Click the Options to reveal more options. Leave New Site selected in the 
Publish To menu, notice the URL that your testing site will have, and leave 
the Data Center at the default Automatic (this is where you want the site 
hosted). Click OK, and the temporary site will be created on the Business 
Catalyst servers.
P Note: The site’s URL 
field in the Options 
section automatically 
removes any special 
characters and spaces 
that you enter in the 
Site Name field. It 
creates a suggested 
URL that will be used 
to access the live 
temporary site. You can 
edit the contents of 
the URL field to change 
the automatically 
generated URL, if 
desired.
P Note: If your client 
lives in a different 
country, you can 
choose the Data Center 
closest to your client’s 
location. The site will 
load and perform 
best in the location 
that corresponds with 
the Data Center you 
select. So if your client 
is viewing the site 
in Australia, you can 
choose the Australia 
Data Center option to 
ensure that the site 
looks best to them, 
even if you are located 
in the United States.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 237
Muse now generates  
the site files (HTML 
files, CSS, scripting, 
images, and other 
content that is 
necessary to make the 
site work in a browser) 
and uploads them to 
the server. Muse also 
converts the .psd files in your site to the best web format, depending on the 
image content. This may take a little while.
When Muse completes its work, and the temporary site is published, the site 
will open in the default browser on your machine. 
4 Close the browser and 
return to Muse, if necessary. 
The New Site Created dialog 
box appears. Click OK to 
close it. 
Now that the site has been published, you can share the domain name 
(kevinskart.businesscatalyst.com) with your clients for review by simply  
e-mailing them the domain name.
P Note: If you are working on a shared workstation with another person, you can change 
the publish account associated with Muse. Choose Adobe Muse > Preferences (Mac OS) or 
Edit > Preferences (Windows), and select Switch Accounts from the Publish With Account 
Menu. This will allow you to enter the username and password for an existing Business Catalyst 
account. Using this strategy, you can each use your own individual preferences. Whenever you 
sign in to Muse on the computer, your preferences will be preserved.

lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
Making and uploading edits
After you upload your testing site, you can make changes to your site in Muse, and 
then upload any changes you make to the Business Catalyst host. In this section, 
you will explore some of the publishing options available, then you will make a 
change to a page in your site and publish the changed page and content.
The first option for publishing that you will explore is how to retrieve the domain 
name for your site if you’ve forgotten it.
1 Click the Publish link in the upper-left corner of the Application window. The 
Publish dialog box opens and lists the name of the site. Click the name to open 
the default browser and view the site.
2 Close the browser, and return to Muse. Click Cancel in the Publish dialog box 
to close it.
This is an easy way to help you to remember the site domain name.
3 In Plan mode, double-click the ABOUT page thumbnail to open that page in 
Design mode. Choose View > Fit Page In Window.
You’re going to make a change to a page, then publish that changed content.
4 Select the Text tool, select the entire quote that begins with “We absolutely 
love the coffee,” and change the text color to the FooterBG color swatch in the 
Control panel. Click away to close the Color Picker.
5 Choose File > Save Site.
6 Click the Publish link in the upper-left corner of the Application window.
7 In the Publish dialog box, click Options. Click the Publish To menu and you 
will see that you can publish the site to a new site, maybe to try something new 
without affecting the original testing site, or you could associate the files with 
another site by selecting another site in the menu. Any other Muse sites that you 
have previously published are listed in the Publish To menu. You can overwrite 
P Note: To view a 
site domain name in 
the browser using this 
method, you will need 
to have published the 
site, which you did in 
the previous section.
E Tip: You could also 
choose File > Publish.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 239
them with the current file, but choose carefully! If you make a mistake, you’ll 
have to open the other site’s .muse file and publish it again.
8 Click the Upload menu to see that you can choose to upload all of the files or 
only those that have been modified. Leave the options at their defaults, and click 
OK to publish just the modified files. The updated site will be opened in the 
default browser.
9 Click the ABOUT page menu item in the top navigation to view the 
ABOUT page, and notice that the text color of the quote in the middle of 
the ABOUT page has updated to use the FooterBG color. Close the browser, 
and return to Muse.
Muse, by default, publishes only the content in your site that has been changed. In 
this case, it publishes the ABOUT page and any other files necessary, such as CSS 
and scripts. If you add a new image or other asset, that new asset is converted to 
a web format, if necessary, and uploaded as well as the page, replacing just those 
files on the server. If you select All Files in the Upload menu, Muse publishes all of 
the site content and replaces the files on the server.
10 Close the ABOUT page to return to Plan mode.

lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
upgrading a temporary Business Catalyst site
When you finish testing a site, you can upgrade it to a paid hosting plan. Your 
account can have multiple sites associated with it, some testing and some paid, 
depending on what point in the design and testing process they are in.
Once you upgrade a site, you’ll begin paying monthly hosting fees for that one 
site—and you are free to continue updating the site’s content as needed. Upgrading 
the site gives you many benefits: You can use your own domain name rather than 
the supplied testing domain name (like kevinkoffeekart.businesscatalyst.com), you 
can add more admin users, and the site will not expire.
Before embarking on the site upgrade process, review the workflow below to get a 
better understanding of the steps required:
• Publish a temporary site from Muse (you did that in the previous section).
• Purchase a domain name from a third-party domain name registrar (examples: 
GoDaddy.com, NetworkSolutions.com, 1and1.com). For the purposes of this 
book, kevinskart.com was purchased.
With your account set up and domain name purchased, you’re ready to convert a 
trial site to a paid hosting site.
1 Ensure that the site you want to upgrade is open within Muse.
2 Click the Manage link in the upper-left corner of the Application window. 
In your default browser, the Business Catalyst Admin Console will open. The 
first step is to upgrade your site. The Admin Console content that first loads in 
the browser when you click Manage in Muse is called the Dashboard.
3 Click the Push Site Live button in the main area of the Business Catalyst 
Admin page.
P Note: The following 
steps will, at one 
point, require you to 
make a purchase. Do 
it when you are ready 
to upgrade your own 
site to a paid hosting 
account. Or, do so when 
your client is ready for 
you to publish their site 
for them, and they have 
provided you with their 
credit card information 
so that you can upgrade 
the site using their 
payment information.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 241
At this point, another Business Catalyst web page is opened, offering hosting 
plans ranging from starter to pro plans. You must purchase one of the plans to 
continue the process. At the time of this writing, you can even choose to bill 
your client directly, instead of paying yourself then billing the amount back to 
the client. If you have a Creative Cloud membership, see the sidebar below.
adobe Creative Cloud membership
Adobe Creative Cloud membership includes hosting for five websites (at the 
“webBasics” membership level). If you have a membership and have pushed less 
than the maximum number of sites live, you can simply click the Push Site Live 
button.

lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
4 After successfully upgrading your site, close the browser and return to Muse.
5 In Muse, with the site open, click Manage to open the Business Catalyst Admin 
page again in the default browser. Notice that with the Dashboard showing, the 
Push Site Live button is gone because the site is now paid, and under the Status 
header, the status has changed from Temporary to Live.
Next, you’ll associate the domain name you purchased with the site to change 
its URL.
6 From the Admin dashboard on the Business Catalyst site, click Add a Domain 
from the Domains section of the Dashboard.
7 Click the New Domain button in the Site Domains section.
You will now enter the domain name that you purchased.
8 In the Add A New Domain window, enter the Domain name you purchased, 
choose Home Page from the Start Page menu, select a country if necessary, 
select a culture from the Culture menu, and click Save, leaving all other default 
settings in the Add a New Domain dialog box.

Adobe Muse ClAssrooM in A book 243
9 After successfully associating a domain with your site, you will see the Site 
Domains section again in the Admin area with a success message in the upper-
right corner.
You will now need to go to the website of the registrar that you used when you 
registered your domain name to point your domain name to the Business Catalyst 
host servers. For more information on entering the DNS information, contact the 
registrar where you purchased your domain name.
The following DNS information can be used:
•
NS1.WORLDSECURESYSTEMS.COM
•

You can add multiple domain names to your site in the Business Catalyst Admin 
dashboard. For instance, you could specify kevinkart.com and kevinskart.com both 
to point to the same site. Of course, you must own both domains and have access 
to the registrar admin to change the DNS information like you saw earlier.
After you’ve upgraded the site, associated a domain name, and updated the DNS 
settings of the domain, users will be able to access the site after a maximum of 7 
days. Sites can usually be seen within 24 to 48 hours.

lesson 10 
Publishing and exporting Your site
exporting your site as htML
If you plan on using your own hosting provider, or want to export a folder of conve-
niently sliced and optimized image files to use for other web purposes (newsletters, 
social media site updates, e-mail signatures, mobile apps), you can export the site as 
HTML. When you export, Muse generates the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image 
files necessary to run the site.
1 With the KevinsKoffeeKart site open, choose File > Export As HTML. In the 
Export to HTML dialog box, click the Location folder icon. In the Select Local 
Folder To Export dialog box that opens, create a new folder on your Desktop 
and then click Create. With the folder selected, click Open (Windows) or Select 
(Mac OS). In the Export To HTML dialog box, click OK.
2 After Muse exports the site, click View Site if you’d like to see the site in a 
browser or click OK to close the dialog box.
When you export HTML from Muse, the files that Muse generates cannot be 
read back in. In other words, if you make any changes to the site in Muse, you 
will need to re-export the HTML.
3 Go to the folder into which you exported the site content to see what Muse 
created.
Congratulations! You’ve finished the site, gotten a good grounding in the workings 
of Muse, and published your site for the world to see.

review questions
1
What are the two methods for sending your site live in Muse?
2
What purpose does excluding pages from export serve?
3
Name an advantage for upgrading your temporary site to a paid site.
4
Name a reason why you might export as HTML.
review answers
1 You can either publish the site content to the Business Catalyst host servers, or you can 
use the File > Export As HTML command to generate the site files in a folder.
2 Excluding pages from export in Muse will not publish or export the designated pages or 
the content that is unique to excluded pages (image files, etc.). This is useful for pages 
for design tests or pages that contain a product you are no longer selling, for instance.
3 Upgrading your trial Muse site to a paid site has many benefits, including that a paid 
site doesn’t expire, you can use your own domain name, and you can add other admin 
users who can also access the site’s Dashboard to view site statistics (reports) or help 
manage the website settings, to name a few.
4 You might export to HTML if you plan on using your own hosting provider or want to 
hand the site files off to someone else.
