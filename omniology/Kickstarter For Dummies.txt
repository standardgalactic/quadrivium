Introduction
K

ickstarter has gone from a small startup Internet company 
in 2009 to one of the leading tools used to fund tens of thou­
sands of creative projects. The company uses a concept called 
crowdfunding, or bringing together many people to support a con­
cept, product, or idea. Crowdfunding works by allowing individuals 
to provide financial backing to a project they want to see come to 
fruition. 
However, Kickstarter is different from other types of fundraising-
oriented platforms. The people posting campaigns are not asking 
for donations for a favorite charity or cause; they are asking back­
ers to believe in their idea. Kickstarter has quickly become a main­
stream way to get a creative project made, whether it’s backing 
for a feature or documentary film or preselling copies of a book. 
According to a July 2012 report in Publishers Weekly, Kickstarter 
has already revolutionized the graphic novel industry, quickly 
becoming the second-largest publisher for this type of work.
Everyone from Academy Award–winning writers to long-established 
musical acts are using Kickstarter to get their latest projects off 
the ground without waiting for a studio or publisher to come along. 
Thanks to the nature of digital giving (using a credit card over the 
Internet), backers can come from anywhere and support projects 
at any level, from $1 to $10,000 and beyond.
About This Book
This book is mostly for anyone considering — or in the process 
of — raising money for a project via a Kickstarter campaign. You 
find a little bit of information about backing projects and an intro­
duction to what Kickstarter is all about, too, but the book’s focus 
is squarely on raising funds through Kickstarter. 
Whether your project is just a spark of an idea or a fully conceived 
one for which you simply need the funds, this book can help you 
with your Kickstarter campaign. This book will give you a step-by-
step guide to conceptualizing your Kickstarter campaign, gathering 
the pieces needed and tools available to maximize your push, as 
well as deciding what to do after your project is funded.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
2
I offer tips to help you accomplish your goals at every stage in 
the process: determining how much to ask for, managing your 
campaign throughout the fundraising timeframe, and more. 
Throughout the book, you also find case studies about successful 
campaigns and how they applied concepts I explain in a chapter.
Kickstarter is a powerful tool — not only to raise funds for your 
idea or project, but also to create a community. The Kickstarter 
website has tools for backer updates, links to Facebook, and 
opportunities to be seen by other enthusiasts in your neighbor­
hood or category. I help you identify ways to use these tools for 
sharing your idea with a large, previously untapped audience.
How This Book Is Organized
This book begins with chapters that cover the basics of Kickstarter, 
including how the site’s all-or-nothing approach works and a his­
tory of some of the most successful campaigns.
The middle chapters address the process for creating your cam­
paign, uploading content, and getting approved. 
The last chapters look at what to do after your project is funded 
and offer a list of ideas for unique backer rewards.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume in writing this book that you know the basics of how to 
use a computer and the Internet, as well as basic communication 
tools like e-mail and Facebook. I also assume you understand the 
basics of loading photos and videos up to the Internet and the idea 
of dragging-and-dropping elements in a program.
However, I do not assume to know why you are using Kickstarter. 
I don’t know about your project, your hopes, and goals. My goal 
is to give you the tools needed to create a successful Kickstarter 
campaign and transform your idea into reality.

Icons Used in This Book
I use some basic icons throughout this book to help you quickly 
scan and find useful information and tips. 
	
When you see the Tip icon, you’re getting a quick tidbit of handy 
information on using Kickstarter.
	
Some information is important to remember as you use 
Kickstarter, so when you see this Remember icon, be sure to tuck 
the information away for future reference. 
	
Watch out! As with any online tool, you might need to avoid 
some pitfalls or do a vital task as you participate. Also, because 
Kickstarter is always changing, I alert you to some potential issues 
in advance.
Where to Go from Here
The simplest route is to read this book in order, from beginning 
to end, but that certainly isn’t mandatory. If you’re brand new to 
Kickstarter or will be setting up your account as you read this 
book, I recommend reading the chapters in order. After you read 
this book, keep it handy and use it as a reference as you navigate 
Kickstarter.
Please keep in mind that web interfaces can change at any 
moment and without notice. The overall concepts in this book 
apply no matter how Kickstarter or the other tools mentioned 
throughout this book change their interfaces. So please know that 
we checked that all the information in this book was accurate as 
the book went to press, but some minor details in the steps and 
the way the websites look are likely to change. For major updates 
related to the book, you can also check out this book’s web page 
at www.dummies.com/go/kickstarterfdupdates.

Chapter 1
Introducing Kickstarter
In This Chapter
▶	Getting a handle on crowdfunding
▶	Understanding how Kickstarter works
▶	Taking advantage of Kickstarter
▶	Spotlighting how Kickstarter is different
“I

 get by with a little help from my friends. . . .” It’s a line from 
one of the Beatles’ most popular songs but also a mantra 
for millions. People seek help for everything — and many great 
communities and companies are built thanks to the generosity of a 
group of people, all working toward a common goal.
That concept has been frequently translated to charitable endeav­
ors. How often have you been asked to donate $5 for a bake sale or 
$25 for a fundraising walk? When you hear statistics about millions 
being raised for a charity through a race or telethon, it’s because a 
large group of people backed the charity — some on a large scale 
at a high level, some on a smaller scale at a more modest level. 
The essential idea, though, is that a large group of people backed a 
cause. Whatever was done was done by a crowd. 
This phenomenon has a name — crowdfunding — and it’s one of the 
essential concepts behind Kickstarter. In the sections that follow, 
you learn what crowdfunding and Kickstarter are all about, discover 
their advantages, and how Kickstarter specifically uses the crowd­
funding concept to help people with funding their creative projects.
Looking at the Concept 
of Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is not a new idea. As I mention earlier, countless char­
ity organizations have used crowds to meet their fundraising goals.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
6
You even see crowdfunding on a very basic level in most house­
holds. Each member contributes something to the overall success of 
the house. Dad contributes X, Mom contributes Y, kids contribute Z. 
Together, the crowd makes the house work, and unlike donating to 
a charity out of the goodness of your heart, people involved in this 
scenario want something out of their backing. In this case, all the 
members of the household work together to benefit from a stable 
residence, protection from the elements, and a sense of community.
Kickstarter was born in 2009 to help creative people get their proj­
ects made with the support of many (“a crowd”) while promising 
these backers something in return. It’s not an altruistic model. 
People back the projects with the expectation that they will get 
something for their money.
Unlike a traditional process of trying to prove your concept to a 
movie studio, publisher, or agent, people are using Kickstarter to 
have their own network of friends, business and professional asso­
ciates, industry peers, and family validate their concept by backing 
the project — in a way, judging whether it will be successful before 
it is even distributed. 
This model is revolutionizing many aspects of business, with cre­
ative people from all walks of life turning to Kickstarter to make 
their projects into realities without waiting for an industry insider 
to give it the green light.
A brief history of Kickstarter
In 2001, Perry Chen was a musician living in New Orleans. He wanted to create an 
event that would dovetail into the city’s famous Jazz Festival — but he didn’t have 
the funds to put on something of this scale by himself. He ended up not trying to 
fund the event himself, but it got him thinking about the idea of asking a group to 
back an event or program, trying to make something happen.
It wasn’t until 2009, after he met up with co-founders Yancey Strickler and Charles 
Adler in New York, that Kickstarter was born.
In the last three years, the company has grown exponentially, creating a viable tool 
for creative types to make their dreams into realities. 
The model seems to be working. As of March 2013, individuals using Kickstarter have
	✓	Launched 89,400 projects
	✓	Funded 37,300 projects — a success rate of 43%
	✓	Raised $434 million

 Chapter 1: Introducing Kickstarter
7
Understanding How Funding 
on Kickstarter Works
The number of launched projects on Kickstarter (89,400 and count­
ing, as I write this chapter) is much larger than the number of suc­
cessfully funded projects (37,300). What does that mean? 
	
Kickstarter uses an all-or-nothing approach to fundraising. This 
means, if you don’t hit your fundraising goal within a certain time­
frame (about 30 to 60 days), you get nothing. As a result, you need 
to be very strategic in your planning, goal-setting, and backer 
solicitation, all of which I cover in depth in this book.
When you launch a Kickstarter project, your fundraising hap­
pens via your Kickstarter campaign page. Potential backers see 
a description of your concept, your fundraising goal, and an 
assortment of backer rewards which you determine. A potential 
backer chooses his or level of support for your project; that per­
son’s pledge goes toward your goal. Figure 1-1 shows an active 
Kickstarter campaign page, where you can see such details as the 
project’s video, funding goal, and days remaining.
Figure 1-1: This campaign page shows the video, funding goal, and days 
remaining.

Kickstarter For Dummies

Over the weeks, your dollars raised will increase and your amount 
to reach your goal will decrease (ideally) each day until your cam­
paign is over.
Kickstarter makes its money by taking a percentage (or fee) from 
your funds raised. Similar to a marketing fee, you are basically 
paying a commission to Kickstarter to use its website to promote 
your campaign. If your Kickstarter campaign is successfully funded, 
Kickstarter will take 5 percent of your final total for its fee.
However, if you come to the end of your Kickstarter campaign and 
have not reached your project goal, you do not receive any of the 
pledges listed to date. You have to raise your minimum goal amount 
to receive any of your backer pledges. You also do not pay any­
thing to Kickstarter, since your campaign was not successful.
In this book, I explain how to prepare for your Kickstarter cam­
paign so that you’re well-positioned for funding success. It’s also 
important to remember that Kickstarter is designed to get your 
project up and running, and you need to have a plan after your 
Kickstarter campaign is over. Chapter 10 looks at some of the tools 
available for creating a business plan for your project, setting your­
self up for the opportunity to sustain your project after the cam­
paign is over, and for making money in the future.
Recognizing the Advantages 
of Kickstarter
You might be a little intimidated by an all-or-nothing approach, 
and by the prospect of asking backers to help you reach your goal. 
However, this model has advantages for both you and your backers:
	
✓	A firm deadline forces you to focus on your campaign and 
on soliciting backers: If you weren’t working against the 
clock, you might be tempted to wait around to see what back­
ers come in, instead of actively soliciting support. This format 
encourages you to move your project along quickly.
	
✓	The all-or-nothing approach is less of a risk to your back­
ers: Since nothing gets funded if the project does not reach 
its goal (that is, prove its value), backers don’t have to worry 
about supporting a potentially losing project. They know their 
accounts will not be charged unless a lot of other people also 
believe in the idea.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Kickstarter
9
Kickstarter also makes it easy to spread the word about your proj­
ect and build community:
	
✓	Backers can share their passion for a project with a click of 
the mouse: Because your fundraising happens online, backers 
can encourage others to get behind an idea through a Facebook 
or Twitter post that includes a link to your campaign page. 
Likewise, bloggers and journalists can boost awareness of your 
campaign and send potential backers your way with a link on 
their own blogs or websites. For example, Figure 1-2 shows a 
post about the Caravan Pacific Kickstarter campaign; the post 
appeared on the popular blog, Design Sponge.
	
✓	Using Kickstarter to get your project off the ground truly 
creates a sense of community: Your backers feel like they are 
really making it happen and are often thrilled to get in on the 
ground floor of something.
Figure 1-2: Example of how word can spread with 
just a click of the mouse.
	
✓	You retain creative control over your project: In the past, if you 
wanted to create a film, art show, project, or play, you needed 
financial backers. That might mean investors or a publisher or a 
studio behind you. The advantage was that potentially one major 
investor might give you the funds needed to make your concept 
come to life — but also exert influence and pressure to change 
your project to meet his or her specifications. You would gain a 
backer, but you might end up losing creative control.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
10
	
	One of Kickstarter’s greatest advantages is that you can still 
solicit the backing needed to get your project off the ground, 
but you maintain complete creative control, delivering a prod­
uct that matches your vision.
	
	Kim Krizan, writer of hit movies, Before Sunrise and Before 
Sunset, knew Kickstarter was the right vehicle for her when 
she wrote a tongue-in-cheek book about a femme fatale and 
wanted to produce it on her own terms.
	
	Being a successful, established writer, she said on her 
Kickstarter page that she could “just get it into the hands of 
a publisher . . . I could also put it online and be done with it. 
But I thought it would be so much cooler to take it directly 
to you.” She decided to use her audience to make the project 
happen without the pressure of a publisher.
	
	As shown in Figure 1-3, Krizan secured 183 backers and beat 
her $10,000 goal by almost $1,000, so she’s on her way!
Figure 1-3: Successful Kickstarter campaign page for Original Sins: Trade 
Secrets of a Femme Fatale.
Knowing What Kickstarter 
Does and Doesn’t Fund
Unlike other web-based tools soliciting funds, Kickstarter is not a 
fundraising tool for charity.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Kickstarter 11
	
Kickstarter is for projects only, not causes or fundraising drives. 
Your campaign must be for a specific creative project or concept. 
If your campaign is determined to be a charity fundraiser, the 
Kickstarter team will deny your application.
Along those same lines, Kickstarter does not allow “Fund My Life” 
projects. You cannot have an open-ended campaign to raise money 
for a trip to Bora Bora or help you fund a sabbatical. Kickstarter 
campaigns are for specific projects and costs. 
If it appears your Kickstarter campaign is to fund a vacation or 
allow you to quit your job, it will be denied.
Kickstarter also doesn’t allow certain types of content, such as 
knives, real estate, bath and beauty products, and nutritional 
supplements. This means projects such as ReadyCase, an iPhone 
case that includes a multitool with regular and serrated blades, as 
shown in Figure 1-4, wouldn’t have been a good fit for Kickstarter, 
even though it’s a legitimate project. The creators of this case 
chose a different crowdfunding site called Indiegogo. 
Figure 1-4: Example of a project that would not meet 
Kickstarter guidelines.
Indiegogo differs most clearly from Kickstarter on one key issue: 
It’s not an all-or-nothing approach. Indiegogo has several models 
that allow you to keep your backer pledges even if you don’t reach 
your goal, for a higher fee.
For the full list of content Kickstarter does and doesn’t allow, 
check out the Prohibited Uses section of the Kickstarter guidelines 
at www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines. The next section 
goes into more detail about how you can familiarize yourself with 
Kickstarter’s terms and conditions.

Kickstarter For Dummies

Reading the Fine Print 
Before You Start
Before you launch or back a campaign on Kickstarter, you need to 
make sure it’s a good fit for the site and understand all the terms 
and conditions. As I mention in the preceding section, you won’t 
get far on Kickstarter if your project doesn’t meet Kickstarter’s 
guidelines. You must also meet Kickstarter’s residency require­
ments. (You must live in the U.S. or the U.K. and meet certain 
requirements in each country.) And don’t forget, if your campaign 
is successful, Kickstarter takes a 5 percent cut of your funds, which 
is how the website stays in business.
	
Of course, you probably bought this book because you’re eager 
to get started on raising the funds for your project. But you’ll do 
yourself a huge favor if you read all the details and requirements 
first. If your campaign is successful, you’ve most likely started a 
small business for yourself, even if you don’t plan to run it forever. 
That comes with certain commitments to Kickstarter, your back­
ers, and your tax bill.
In the following sections, I point you to the key areas of the 
Kickstarter site that help you become familiar with Kickstarter’s 
terms and the responsibilities you take on if your campaign is suc­
cessful. I also point you to features on the Kickstarter site that help 
you run a successful campaign.
To find these tools, click the What Is Kickstarter? link at the top of 
the Kickstarter home page, as shown in Figure 1-5.

Discovering the Crowdfunding 
Process
Running a successful Kickstarter campaign is a lot of work, but 
most of it is the fun kind of work because you’re doing it to sup­
port your passion and creative idea. The following steps walk you 
through the overall process of a Kickstarter campaign and point 
you to the chapters where you find out more about each phase of 
the process:
	
1.	Make sure you have a clearly defined project. 
	
	 To start, you need to make sure your idea is clear and 
unique. Then you need to figure out how to communicate 
why your project needs to be made in a straightforward 
and succinct way to your backers. You find help doing just 
that in Chapter 2.
	
2.	Figure out what your fundraising goal should be and how 
much your rewards need to cost in order to meet that goal. 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
16
	
	 Because Kickstarter requires you to ask for a certain 
amount of money, you have to figure out the minimum 
amount of money you need to cover the costs of creating 
your project — and the different levels of donations you 
need to meet that goal. Chapter 3 goes into detail about 
building an accurate budget.
	
3.	 Set a realistic timeline. 
	
	Kickstarter requires you to raise your funds in a certain 
amount of time, and your backers will also want to know 
when they’ll receive the rewards you’re offering. Your 
campaign and your relationship with your backers will go 
much more smoothly if you think through your timeline in 
advance. In Chapter 4, I lay out some suggestions on how to 
build a timeline that works for both you and your backers, 
taking into account such factors as troubleshooting possible 
delays, handling holidays, and watching out for industry fac­
tors that might influence your planning process.
	
4.	 Prepare your campaign and submit it for Kickstarter 
review and approval. 
	
	Steps 1–3 are all up-front work. You want to make sure 
you’ve thought through the important details before you 
start developing your campaign page through Kickstarter’s 
dashboard for project creators. This step is where you take 
all the content and data you’ve been developing and enter 
it into what amounts to a proposal that Kickstarter will 
review. If your project meets all of Kickstarter’s require­
ments, you receive an e-mail that Kickstarter has approved 
your project. Chapter 5 walks you through each part of the 
Kickstarter project setup process and gives you helpful tips 
to ensure that your project makes it through the review 
process smoothly.
	
5.	 Launch your campaign and promote your project on a 
day-to-day basis. 
	
	 You can’t just launch your campaign and hope for the 
best. To reach your funding goal, you need to reach out to 
friends, family, and your personal and professional com­
munities. You also need to promote your deadline. Chapter 
6 helps you stay on top of all the key tools, both online and 
elsewhere, that help you reach out to potential backers and 
the backers you gain throughout your campaign. Chapter 
7 orients you to the tools in the Kickstarter-sponsored 
iPhone app that help you manage an active campaign while 
you’re on the go.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Kickstarter 17
	
6.	Stay in touch with backers as you create your project and 
deliver backer rewards. 
	
	 Remember, when you get to the end of your Kickstarter 
campaign, that doesn’t mean your project is over — far 
from it! Your backers have invested their own money in 
your project and are likely interested to hear how it’s 
going. You have a unique opportunity to continue building 
community among your backers as you create your project. 
You also have to manage the nuts and bolts of delivering 
the rewards you promised your backers in a timely manner. 
Kickstarter has tools to help you with all these, and in 
Chapter 8, I walk you through the steps of using each one. 
You also find my tips for finishing your campaign and build­
ing upon it to ensure long-term success.
In Chapter 9, you find ten unique reward ideas, and in Chapter 10, 
ten resources beyond Kickstarter that can help you throughout the 
stages of your Kickstarter campaign. Each of these chapters gives 
you even more ammunition for Kickstarter success!

Chapter 2
Laying the Foundation for 
Your Kickstarter Campaign
In This Chapter
▶	Getting your project ready for crowdfunding
▶	Highlighting what makes your project unique
▶	Writing your project description to appeal to supporters 
▶	Making the best use of Kickstarter categories
O

ne of the biggest challenges (and also opportunities) with 
Kickstarter is deciding what your unique project will be, 
determining what makes it special, and then labeling it in the 
appropriate category.
In this chapter, I examine ways to think about framing your project 
and communicating what makes it unique, and also determining its 
appropriate Kickstarter category.
In order to create a winning and engaging campaign, you need to 
have a dynamic and interesting presence on Kickstarter. Hundreds 
of projects are added every week, so yours needs to stand out and 
catch everyone’s eye, not just your friends. 
In this chapter, I show you how to make a strong impression by 
carefully choosing your category, writing interesting copy, and 
creating a compelling video to explain your Kickstarter project. I’ll 
also delve into some of the resources available around the web to 
make your content as interesting as possible.

Transforming Your Passion into 
a Kickstarter Project
Your best bet is to have a specific project already in mind. If you 
just want to use Kickstarter to stimulate your creative juices, that’s 
putting the cart before the horse. Your campaign needs to be con­
crete and well-rounded, focused on putting a real product out. If 
you’re having trouble figuring out what project is the best fit for 
your passion, this section can help. 
To start, consider the following example: Say you’re interested 
in sharing the story of an amazing disabled athlete who has over­
come horrendous injuries and is now competing at the World 
Triathlete Championships. You know this athlete personally and 
feel his story of triumph over tragedy could inspire others — but 
you’re unsure about how to proceed.
A first step would be to think about this passion and the best pos­
sible way to tell the story. Make a list that examines the following 
questions:
	
✓	Is this a story you can tell in real time? Continuing the earlier 
example, telling the story in real time means you’ll follow the 
athlete’s upcoming competition. A story that’s not in real time 
would have a different focus (say, retelling an amazing past 
accomplishment).
	
✓	What kind of material will you have access to and use to 
tell this story? For example, will you have video and photos, 
or just photos? This consideration might help you determine 
whether your project should be a short film or a photo-gallery 
showing.
	
✓	Are you familiar with the project’s topic personally, or is 
it something you’ll need to research? How close are you to 
a subject? If you don’t have a personal relationship with the 
potential person(s) involved, perhaps seek out opportunities 
to get to know him or her before beginning the Kickstarter 
project.
	
✓	Do you have more experience in one type of project than 
another? If you have written many magazine articles and 
short stories in the past, but have never attempted a short 
film or documentary, consider researching articles and 
seminars relating to topics such as “translating a story to 
film” before you embark on the project. 

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 21
	
✓	How many resources would you have at your disposal for 
each type of project you’re considering? Make a list of every 
piece of equipment, software program, or other tool you 
have for each type of project (film, book, showing, whatever); 
see where the biggest gaps in your list are. Also, think about 
whether you will need to hire people to help make your proj­
ect a reality. In Chapter 3, you consider the need to pay for or 
barter with this outside help.
By examining your responses to all these questions, you can get 
a clear idea of what it takes to turn your passion into a project. 
When you know what type of project you want to create, you’re 
ready to start preparing the material for your Kickstarter cam­
paign, as I explain in the next section. 
Prepping to Start Your Project
You can save time down the road by preparing key elements 
of your project information before you begin to set it up on 
Kickstarter. Figure 2-1 gives you an overview of the elements you 
need to prepare for your campaign page, which explains your over­
all vision for your Kickstarter project. The following list introduces 
each item:
Figure 2-1: An overview of a Kickstarter campaign page.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
22
	
✓	A fabulous project name: The name for your project is criti­
cal because it needs to explain what the project is all about. 
Chose a title that is simple, specific, and memorable. Avoid 
using words like help; such words are too generic. Choose 
words that exemplify what you’re doing through active terms. 
Here are some examples of good project names that are com­
pelling and specific:
 
• Nomiku: Bring sous vide into your kitchen
 
• Fund the 2013 Union Square Fire Dancing Expo
 
• The Goon Movie — Let’s Kickstart this Sucker!
	
✓	An image that represents your project: Kickstarter requires 
an image in a 4:3 aspect ratio, meaning that the image is 
slightly more horizontal than vertical. Also, be sure that the 
image has a high enough resolution to look good on the World 
Wide Web — ideally 200 dpi or higher to avoid pixilation.
	
	Choose an image that summarizes your project in a nutshell, 
like a logo, a photo of your design prototype or book cover, a 
screen shot from a video (if you’re already underway on pro­
duction), still photos from a studio shoot, and so on. Ideally 
you won’t use just a photo of yourself, but instead something 
that shows what the project is about.
	
	Your project image needs to grab a viewer’s attention and 
visually illustrate the nature of your project quickly. The 
image is featured on the Kickstarter main page if someone 
is searching in your category or geographic region. Figure 
2-2 showcases a great project image for the Pebble E-Paper 
Watch, discussed in this book as the all-time most successful 
Kickstarter campaign. The image is simple, clean, compelling, 
and clearly shows the project.
	
✓	A short blurb that describes your project: Think Twitter; 
think elevator pitch. The limit for your short description 
is 135 characters (not 135 words). For pointers on creating 
an effective description, flip to “What Makes Your Project 
Unique? Writing a Short Project Description” later in this 
chapter. The short description will appear just below your 
photo on your main project page; it should be almost as short 
as a photo caption. It will also appear with your project image 
on any category or search pages, as mentioned earlier.
	
✓	A short video that grabs attention: A key element of every 
Kickstarter project is a short video, ideally two minutes or 
less. See the section “Making a Compelling Video” later in this 
chapter for more details.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 23
Figure 2-2: The Pebble E-Paper Watch had a great project image for its 
Kickstarter campaign.
	
✓	Duration for your project campaign: Kickstarter recommends 
a campaign timeframe of 30 days or less, but doesn’t insist 
upon it. The campaign duration is your call. In fact, several 
campaigns run up to 60 days. The advantage of a shorter 
window is a sense of urgency to encourage backers to donate; 
however, it gives you less time to promote your project. I sug­
gest you check out the details about managing and spreading 
the word about your campaign (they’re in Chapter 6) before 
you determine your campaign duration.
	
✓	A project funding goal: Before you go online to set up a proj­
ect, think through your funding needs and have an amount in 
mind. Setting the funding goal is a big part of any program’s 
success. Chapter 3 goes into detail about how much to ask 
for, depending on what your project needs.
	
✓	A category: Every Kickstarter project needs to fit into one 
of the site’s defined categories. The section “Understanding 
Kickstarter Categories” later in this chapter details the avail­
able categories and how to classify your project, but think 
early on about what category your work might fall into.
	
✓	Your bio: You will be asked to write a short description about 
yourself for your project. If you have an existing bio/CV/
résumé completed, locate it and review it before you go any 
further; think about what elements you want to highlight in 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
24
your personal Kickstarter bio. Be sure to include any experi­
ence or accomplishments you have that demonstrate your 
ability to meet the goals you’ve outlined in your campaign.
	
✓	A full description of your project: Beyond the short blurb, 
you will be writing a detailed description of your campaign, 
goals, risks, and challenges. The section “Creating the Long 
Project Description” later in this chapter details the steps 
needed to fill this out, and it is a good idea to begin outlining 
the details of your campaign before you go much further.
	
✓	Rewards: Every Kickstarter campaign has backer rewards at 
several funding levels. Even if you’re unsure about your own 
potential rewards at this point, take a quick browse through 
other campaigns on the site to get an idea of the types of 
reward levels out there. You find out more about rewards in 
Chapters 3 and 9.
What Makes Your Project Unique? 
Writing a Short Project Description
Your short project description needs to convey your project’s 
unique selling point. This may sound a bit like a marketing term, 
and in a way, it is. This description appears just below your main 
project image on your campaign home page and on any search 
pages. You only get 135 characters (this includes spaces) in these 
areas of the Kickstarter site to make your project stand out.
Tens of thousands of books, movies, comic books, games, and 
products are marketed every year. Your Kickstarter project is no 
different. A strong unique selling point helps you
	
✓	Create a concise project description.
	
✓	Describe your project quickly to potential backers.
	
✓	Differentiate your project from the thousands of others on the 
market.
	
The following steps can help you pinpoint what makes your proj­
ect unique in your short product description:
	
1.	Describe your project in one word: film, book, show, 
design, product, painting, and so on. 
	
	 This single-word description helps you get at the very core 
of the project and gets you thinking about how to differen­
tiate from other ideas.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 25
	
2.	Build a powerful phrase or sentence around your one 
word.
	
	 For example: A film about families struggling to overcome 
poverty in rural America. 
	
	 This expanded phrase explains the core of the project.
	
3.	Expand your sentence so that it explains why your project 
is different or better than others on the market: 
	
	Unlike previous documentaries that only show the nuts-and-
bolts basics of the fiscal impact of poverty in rural America, 
this film will go deeper, examining the specific psychological 
effects long-term poverty has on rural families.
	
4.	Check the character count of your sentence. In Microsoft 
Word, you can do this by selecting the text and clicking 
the word count in the lower-left corner of the screen. 
	
	 When you click the word count, a Word Count dialog box 
appears with additional details including the character 
count without spaces and the character count with spaces. 
Most other word processing programs offer a similar tool.
	
5.	If you’re not within the 135-character limit, start by 
deleting any unnecessary words and looking for phrases 
that you can make more concise by replacing them with 
single words.
	
	 In the example just given, the description is beyond 135 
characters (spaces count for characters). If the differentiat­
ing quality of the film is psychological effects versus fiscal 
impact, you might narrow down the description as follows:
	
	Documentaries about poor rural American families usually 
focus on money. This film examines poverty’s deep psycho­
logical effects.
	
	 This new description is only 130 characters, including 
spaces.
	
You may find yourself struggling a bit here, determining how to 
phrase your expanded sentence and short unique selling proposi­
tion. Practice describing your project in a succinct way a few dif­
ferent times. After you edit down the description as needed, read 
and re-read the description. Create multiple versions with different 
lead-ins until you find the right mix.
If you find you cannot describe your project quickly and accu­
rately, perhaps you have too vague of a concept. Think about what 
you want to focus on, and then ask the following questions (each 
sample question is followed by a real-world example):

Kickstarter For Dummies 
26
	
✓	Is there a way I can limit the time duration of my project? 
Instead of following an athlete for an entire year on his or her 
journey, should I only focus on a three-month window?
	
✓	Should I focus on a specific geographic area? Is it too ambi­
tious to document all the taco shops in California? Should I 
only focus on one region, such as Southern California?
	
✓	Is my finished product too long? Would this film about a 
symphony be better as a short documentary instead of a full-
length one?
	
✓	Would this concept be building on (or redoing) something 
already in the market? If so, how? Where will my project 
take the concept? How is this iPhone accessory different from 
the hundreds of others already on Kickstarter?
 	
✓	Can I eliminate an element of my project? Do I need to make 
three versions of my comic book? Should I only produce one?
	
✓	Should I collaborate with someone else to make the project 
more complete or understandable? If I partner with a vid­
eographer, can we make a combination web series and docu­
mentary at the same time to make a more compelling finished 
product?
Start with whatever notes you have for your unique selling propo­
sition. Then go through and answer each of these questions indi­
vidually. Expand or contract your unique selling proposition based 
on your responses. Then try rewording it.
Creating the Long Project 
Description
On your campaign page, your long project description appears 
below the short blurb. This long project description is your 
opportunity to tell the full story of your passion and reasoning 
behind your Kickstarter campaign. Although you aren’t limited by 
a certain number of characters, it’s best to first revisit the initial 
description that you started when you were writing your short 
blurb. Go back to that first sentence you were writing, and instead 
of trying to cut it down to 135 characters, look at how you can 
expand on it:
	
✓	Write as if you were talking to a friend about how your pas­
sion got started.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 27
	
✓	Use a conversational tone, so potential backers get a sense of 
what you’re like.
	
✓	Use at least 3–4 sentences to describe why you want to make 
your project.
	
✓	In as much detail as possible, describe the steps of your proj­
ect and various milestones you hope to accomplish.
	
✓	Similar to when you wrote your short blurb, clearly define 
how your project is different from others and why a backer 
should pledge. In addition to text, you have many opportuni­
ties to apply formatting and add additional media. Use the 
Bold, Underline, and Italic formatting buttons to draw atten­
tion to specific elements of your campaign or key milestones.
You can also link to other web pages or content here as well. If you 
want potential backers to learn more about the issue or topic asso­
ciated with your project, insert the appropriate web links.
Choosing media to support 
your description
	
Media is the key to keeping attention here! In the Project 
Description box, you can add pictures, audio, and more video to 
support your idea.
I would recommend adding specific media here to help tell your 
story. You might have used these already in your Project Video, 
but it doesn’t hurt to reinforce your story and also give potential 
backers quick information that they can browse without watching 
the entire video:
	
✓	Photos of your project in action (if available)
	
✓	Photos related to your topic and supporting visuals
	
✓	Short audio clips — especially helpful if you’re a musician and 
have a demo track or sample of how your project sounds
	
✓	Video clips from your project (if available)
	
✓	Photos or video clips from any press interviews you may 
have done
	
Keep all your clips in this section short, ideally 20 to 30 seconds or 
fewer. You want potential backers to get a sense of the campaign 
and your specific points, but keep in mind that they have a lot of 
content to go through!

Kickstarter For Dummies 
28
Risks and Challenges
The project description also includes a section called Risks and 
Challenges. This special section lets you address what issues 
you think might come up during your project and how you plan 
to address them. In short, this gives your backers some peace of 
mind when they ask, “Does this person have the ability to pull this 
project off?” or even more importantly, “Do I feel confident giving 
this person my money, sure that he or she will deliver the item in 
the campaign as promised?”
	
Unhappy Kickstarter backers tend to be very vocal about over­
due rewards, production delays, and changes. Especially if your 
campaign includes a lot of variables that might be out of your 
control, be sure to use this section to highlight the potential pit­
falls clearly and how you are anticipating overcoming them. The 
last thing you want is a bunch of unhappy backers posting about 
delays on social media!
In order to best fill out this box, go back to your project budget 
and review all the parts required to make your campaign a suc­
cess. Which elements do you think might present the biggest 
obstacles?
Here are a few examples of such challenges:
	
✓	Unable to get required raw material (such as video footage, 
usable images, interview audio) to complete the project
	
✓	Running out of time or missing deadlines
	
✓	Conflicts with weather/seasons/special events
	
✓	Personal time constraints
	
✓	Production delays
	
✓	Lack of knowledge or technical skill
	
✓	Budget overages
For each bullet item you think of for your individual campaign, 
come up with at least one (ideally two) responses that show how 
you will handle each problem.
Combine the potential challenges and solutions list into a para­
graph or two and paste it here. By addressing these issues early, 
you get used to thinking about what you might need to have in 

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 29
place before even launching your campaign — and about how to 
assure your backers that you have the skills needed to handle the 
challenges. This early, proactive thinking builds community with 
your backers for the long haul.
Making a Compelling Video
Your video is featured at the very top of your Kickstarter campaign 
page — and needs to draw in potential backers quickly.
Before even starting your project, it’s best to spend time creating 
the video and getting it ready for upload. 
	
A polished video eases the approval process (in which Kickstarter 
reviews your overall project application). If your video flows 
smoothly, has a good look and feel, and accurately explains your 
project, the Kickstarter review team can see that you understand 
the guidelines and requirements for a campaign. If your video is 
unfinished or hard to follow, it may be harder for Kickstarter to see 
that your campaign fits its requirements.
In the following sections, you explore what content to include in 
your video and basic tools for creating a video.
Outlining the content for your video
The video is one of the most important tools you have to get back­
ers excited about your Kickstarter campaign. Why? The video tells 
a story in an easy-to-follow way and doesn’t require backers to go 
through lines of text. 
Your video needs to specifically address your Kickstarter cam­
paign. Be sure you clearly convey the primary goal of your cam­
paign. For example, is the campaign hoping to completely fund 
a new fashion item and get it in stores, or provide resources to 
make samples for a trunk show? As you gather your raw materials 
outlined later in this section, constantly think about how each ele­
ment will illustrate the goal of your campaign. If it doesn’t fit, don’t 
use it. A hilarious photo of your product idea in some fantastical 
scene doesn’t necessarily belong in your Kickstarter video. Even if 
humorous, your video needs to be professional and convey a clear 
message to instill confidence in your backers.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
30
	
An important element to consider when beginning your Project 
Video: Two minutes or less! Why two minutes or less? Internet users, 
even those seeking creative projects and content, have an extremely 
short attention span. An average commercial is 30 seconds; an 
average television news segment is two and a half minutes. If you 
can’t tell the story of your project in under two minutes, it’s unlikely 
you will be able to draw backers in. 
Before beginning production of your video, gather up and identify 
the raw materials you might want to include, such as
	
✓	Existing video clips of your project underway, if available
	
✓	Still photos from your project underway, if available
	
✓	Still photos of prototypes, samples, or examples of what you 
hope to produce
	
✓	Illustrations or animated panels you want to show onscreen 
to highlight a film’s story
	
✓	Existing video or news clips that relate to your product or 
eventual goal
	
✓	Music clips or downloads for purchase that fit with the theme 
of your project
Choosing tools to make a great video
Gone are the days when you needed expensive editing equipment 
to make a video. Because you’re not posting a video for broadcast 
television, it doesn’t need to be HD resolution, although many 
phones and small cameras can shoot video in HD. Even if you don’t 
actually have video footage for the project, you can use a number 
of tools to turn still photos into a video with music or other sound. 
Two major computer-based resources to try are
	
✓	iMovie: This drag-and-drop program comes standard on most 
Mac computers now and allows you to input video clips, 
photos, and music into a central file and edit them together 
into a finished piece.
	
✓	Windows Movie Maker: Part of the Microsoft suite of software 
often found on PCs that have recent versions of Windows 
and Office installed. If it is not pre-installed on your com­
puter, you can download it from the Microsoft website at 
Microsoft.com.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 31
If you don’t have access to a desktop-based editing program or are 
intimidated by the idea of using one, there are other, extremely 
user-friendly ways to create a video — even from still photos:
	
✓	Animoto (http://animoto.com): This web-based tool 
enables you to create an unlimited number of 30-second 
videos for free, using a drag-and-drop tool. You can become 
a member for as little as $30/year to get access to templates 
and music to make videos of any duration.
	
	Log on to the website to start your video project, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
	
	You then can begin uploading your raw data, such as videos 
and still photos, as shown in Figure 2-4. You then manipulate 
your video elements to tell your Kickstarter story.
	
	Music adds an important element to any video project and 
can create a fun, serious, energetic, or lighthearted mood.

✓	YouTube Video Editor (www.youtube.com/editor): 
YouTube already is a great place to upload and showcase 
your videos; the website also has a good online tool for basic 
editing and enhancement. Using this free editor, you can 
 
• Combine video clips.
 
• Stabilize blurriness.
 
• Add transitions and music.
 
• Make precise timing edits.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 33
	
	YouTube Video Editor does not allow you to integrate 
still photos like Animoto does, but it is a good tool if you 
already have a collection of video clips and you need to 
edit it down into two minutes for your Kickstarter Project 
Video.
	
	Figure 2-6 shows the user interface for YouTube Video 
Editor.
	
✓	Picasa: Most people think of Picasa as a photography tool, 
used to organize and upload photos to web albums. However, 
this tool from Google also has functions that let you make a 
video from just your still photos, similar to Animoto. If you 
don’t already have Picasa on your computer, you can down­
load it for free from www.picasa.google.com. Install it by 
clicking the program file in your “downloads” folder or open­
ing the file from where you told your computer to save the 
program.
	
	After you launch the program, it automatically starts scan­
ning your computer for all the pictures and video files on 
your hard drive and puts them into the Picasa library. From 
there, you can quickly start building a project around your 
Kickstarter video.

A smartphone is another tool you can use to create a Kickstarter 
Project Video. Most smartphones (iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, 
and so on) come with an integrated video camera. For a simple 
and straightforward video about your project, try the following 
steps:
	
1.	Use your phone to film a short two-minute synopsis of the 
project, showing any relevant visuals, details, or project 
elements.
	
	 Remember that you will not be able to edit, manipulate, 
or change this video; you will have to shoot it in real time, 
exactly as you would like it to appear online. If you choose 
this method, you need to have any and all props or visuals 
already organized and ready, and be sure to monitor your 
time (to keep it under two minutes). Practice several times 
before shooting for real.
	
2.	To save the video to your computer, sync your phone 
with your computer or e-mail the video file to yourself.
	
3.	Preview your video.
	
	 The following points are good to check, especially if you’ve 
filmed the video on a smartphone:
 
• Does the video display well on a desktop or laptop as 
well as on a mobile device?
 
• Can you understand the audio throughout the video? 
 
• Is the lighting bright enough that your potential back­
ers can see what you want the video to show?
 
• Is the video jerky or unstable? Consider re-shooting 
using a tripod, resting the phone on a steady sur­
face, or having a friend help you if you shot the 
video yourself.
 
• Did you remember all the content you planned to 
include in the video?
	
4.	Upload the video when you come to that part of your 
project’s development.
	
	 Chapter 5 walks you through the details of setting up your 
campaign in Kickstarter.

Understanding Kickstarter 
Categories
	
Many people come to the Kickstarter website and browse categories 
they’re already interested in; it’s critical to place your project in the 
category most aligned with your finished product. In the following 
sections, you find an introduction to each Kickstarter category and 
tips on choosing the best category for your project.
Introducing the categories
When you first come to the Kickstarter main page, you see a staff 
pick for the project of the day and a listing of all the Kickstarter 
categories in a column at the right of the screen. The following list 
gives you examples of the types of projects that are suitable for 
each category.
	
✓	Art: The category includes paintings, drawings, sculpture, 
performance art, digital art, watercolors, pencil art, chalk art, 
charcoal art, and art schools or instruction. Figure 2-7 shows 
the Kickstarter campaign page for an art installation at the 
Dead Sea. The campaign’s goal was to highlight the importance 
of water conservation.
Figure 2-7: This project for an art installation at the Dead Sea 
was featured in the Art category.

✓	Comics: Here you find comic books, ongoing comic strips, online 
comic series, and products for comic enthusiasts. Figure 2-8 
shows the Kickstarter campaign page for The Bargain, a graphic 
novel, which appeared in the Comics category. So did The Order 
of the Stick, a comic strip series that was turned into a printed 
book. (Find out more about The Order of the Stick in Chapter 3.) 
That project fit this category best because it specifically deals 
with a comic strip format, even though the campaign was for 
re-printing of a book-style collection.
	
✓	Dance: Projects in this category include dance recitals, dance 
troupe costumes, choreography services, and dance festivals. 
Figure 2-9 is a sample Dance entry, which is a campaign to 
expand a dance and movement installation into an evening-
length dance performance for a festival in Brooklyn.
Figure 2-8: This graphic novel project appeared in the 
Comics category.
Figure 2-9: This Kickstarter campaign’s goal is to expand 
a modern dance performance.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 37
	
✓	Design: This category is for Kickstarter projects related to 
product development, modeling/fabrication, and graphic 
design. Projecteo, shown in Figure 2-10, featured its campaign 
for a tiny Instagram projector (which enables users to project 
their Instagram images) in the Design category. Projecteo is 
a great example of the type of new tool or product that is a 
good fit for the Design category. See the section, “Choosing 
the right category,” a little later in this chapter for more about 
deciding whether the Design category is right for your project.
	
✓	Fashion: This category accommodates designers of jewelry 
and clothing (including hats, scarves, gloves, and accessories). 
Projects that take the form of fashion shows and product-line 
launches typically opt for the Fashion category. Figure 2-11 
shows a Fashion entry for Iva Jean, which launched a Kickstarter 
campaign for the creation and distribution of a line of women’s 
clothing that’s designed to be clean-cut for work but that also 
meets the needs of bicycle commuters.
Figure 2-10: The Projecteo campaign appeared in the 
Design category.
Figure 2-11: Iva Jean is a natural fit for the Fashion category.

✓	Film & Video: If your project is a documentary, short film, 
full-length feature film, instructional video, or web series, 
it’s likely a good fit for the Film & Video category. Figure 2-12 
shows a sample Film & Video entry, a campaign for the docu­
mentary, Love Thy Nature, which explores individual connec­
tion with the natural world.
	
✓	Food: Food projects can take various directions, including the 
launch or development of an edible product, a project for a 
farmer’s market or community co-op, or tools and equipment 
for chefs or restaurants. Sugar Knife Marshmallows, for example, 
placed its campaign for a small batch of artisanal marshmallows 
in the Food category, as shown in Figure 2-13. See “Choosing the 
right category” later in this chapter if you need help deciding 
whether your food-related project should appear in Food or in 
another category, such as Publishing for a cookbook.
Figure 2-12: Love Thy Nature is a documentary and thus 
appeared in the Film & Video category.
Figure 2-13: Sugar Knife Marshmallows placed its campaign 
in the Food category.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 39
	
✓	Games: This category covers traditional board games; video 
games; online games; role-playing games; and equipment such 
as game accessories, tools, and consoles. Figure 2-14 shows a 
sample Games entry for a video game called Timber and Stone.
	
✓	Music: If the goal of your project is to fund a musical concert 
or record an album, the Music category is a good fit. Musicians 
looking to fund the production costs of creating an album or 
expanding a short album into a longer project often turn to 
Kickstarter to raise the funds. One example is Austin Lucas, 
whose Kickstarter campaign page is shown in Figure 2-15.
Figure 2-14: This sample Games entry showcases the 
production of the Timber and Stone video game.
Figure 2-15: Austin Lucas chose the Music category for 
his campaign to raise funds needed for the production 
a new studio album.

✓	Photography: Shutterbug projects such as photography 
books, gallery showings, and exhibitions fit the Photography 
category. Your photo project might be to raise funds for 
prints, the exhibition space, or production costs. Figure 2-16 
shows a campaign for a photography book that features les­
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender athletes.
	
✓	Publishing: This category covers major traditional areas of 
publishing: fiction books, nonfiction books, photo books, 
short story anthologies, and journalism. Figure 2-17 shows a 
sample Publishing entry for a fictional series. The Finding 40 
Project, featured in a case study in Chapter 6, also appeared 
in the Publishing category.

✓	Technology: High-tech creativity can find a home in hardware, 
software, gadgets, or accessories for smartphones/computers. 
Figure 2-18 shows a Technology entry for a new type of small 
electronics component board for engineers.
	
✓	Theater: This category is for dramatic plays, musical plays, 
theater camps and workshops, and theater restorations or 
upgrades. Figure 2-19 shows a sample Theater entry.
Figure 2-18: TinyDuino appeared in the Technology 
category.

Choosing the right category
I recommend spending a few minutes on the Kickstarter main page — 
before you do anything else — reviewing multiple campaigns in 
your likely category.
Possibly your potential campaign could work in more than one cat­
egory. For example, is a cookbook more appropriate for the Food 
category or the Publishing category? To answer this question, I 
examine some choices in each category and why they fit one cat­
egory better than another:
	
✓	Food: Most projects in this category have to do specifically 
with the production, distribution, or delivery of food; the 
small batch of artisan marshmallows (refer to Figure 2-13) 
is a natural fit. Are you trying to create a project that has to 
do with eventual distribution of a food product to people (as 
opposed to helping people figure out what to do with that 
food)? Your project belongs in the Food category if it’s edible.
	
✓	Publishing: Projects in this category would be more closely 
related to the story of — or how-tos related to — food. 
Cookbooks are classic examples. Successful campaigns for 
books about food, such as the Publishing the +5 of Eating 
Cookbook and Trailer Food Diaries: Cookbook, appear in the 
Publishing/Nonfiction category. That’s not to say you can’t 
put a cookbook in a Food category. Some authors do, as 
was the case for Cooking with Fire: The Disaster Cookbook. 
However, most projects that end up with a finished book 
should be in the Publishing category.
	
✓	Design: Many of Kickstarter’s most successful campaigns 
come up in the Design category, where clever product design­
ers create innovative new tools or products that customers 
are eager to preorder. In this chapter, I examine the success 
of the Elevation Dock campaign, tapping into one of the larg­
est consumer audiences in the United States: Apple iPhone 
users.
	
	This product could also fall into two categories: Design or 
Technology. It’s important to look at the key central point of 
the campaign: the design and creation of a product that fits 
a market niche or need. This product is not simply another 
gadget or add-on to a phone; it is truly a design improvement 
based on others available on the market, hence the placement 
in the Design category.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 43
iPhone Elevation Dock: Realizing 
a Market Niche
The Kickstarter campaign for the Elevation Dock illustrates how 
you can pinpoint a product’s unique angle and create campaign 
materials around that angle.
For all the worldwide fans Apple has clamoring for its innovative 
phone and music products, there seems to always be a problem 
with one key element: the charging stations. Often, after purchas­
ing a basic Apple product, consumers look for ways to dock or 
charge the product that do the job better than the basic plug-in 
charger issued by the manufacturer. There are many options on 
the market, but many of those products suffer from a specific 
design flaw: They don’t allow for the protective case.
Consumers who spend hundreds of dollars on a phone or other 
device often purchase a protective case to shield the item from 
damage in case of drops or bumps. The problem (and also the 
opportunity): No one standard size or dimensions can fit all of 
those products — dozens of models are available for each individ­
ual gadget, all made by different companies. A sample aftermarket 
iPhone case illustrates this point in Figure 2-20:
Figure 2-20: Sample aftermarket case, showing diversity in selection.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
44
Additionally, many of these other aftermarket docks weren’t made 
with the same care and standards as other Apple products have to 
meet — consumers would complain the docks were too flimsy or 
lightweight or didn’t dock and undock smoothly.
Casey Hopkins of ElevationLab (http://elevationlab.com) 
recognized this challenge in 2011 and began work on a design for 
the solution — the Elevation Dock, which is specially designed to 
charge an iPhone regardless of the case size.
A standard Apple Dock sells for $29 and ElevationLab listed its 
base model for sale on Kickstarter at $59, a price more than 100% 
higher than that of the manufacturer’s version. Why such a differ­
ence? According to ElevationLab’s website, it’s “The Best Dock for 
iPhone,” and the press seemed to agree.
According to a December 2011 writeup in Wired Magazine (during 
the Kickstarter campaign), the Elevation Dock is “the dock Apple 
should have made.” This type of endorsement is extremely power­
ful for the millions of Apple users who routinely pay a premium to 
have the latest and best technology. Figure 2-21 shows the manu­
facturer’s version of a dock.
Figure 2-21: Apple’s standard dock product.

 Chapter 2: Laying the Foundation for Your Kickstarter Campaign 45
The Kickstarter campaign also tapped into another touchpoint for 
Apple users: the chance to preorder something before it goes on 
sale. Apple users notoriously line up around the block when the 
newest phone is released; the stores are often packed whenever a 
new generation iPad comes out or an accessory pack is released. 
These users love to get the newest thing first, ideally before 
anyone else can get their hands on it. 
Elevation Dock’s Kickstarter campaign was essentially a pre-sale 
for the product before it had even gone into official production. 
The company’s original $75,000 goal was to fund a first production 
run and pre-sell some of the docks.
Surpassing $1.4 million at the end of its campaign in February 2012, 
the company had raised more than enough to not only fund an entire 
production run, but also to offer special limited edition “Kickstarter 
Exclusive” colors and finishes (as shown in Figure 2-22), as well as 
reseller packs — pre-selling large numbers of docks to retail resellers 
around the country.
Clearly, this campaign knew its audience.

to Ask For

▶	Estimating average donations
E

very campaign, no matter how large or small, needs a budget 
and a fundraising goal. This goal should be a figure that repre­
sents the amount needed to make your creative project a reality, 
or at least get it underway.
In this chapter, I discuss the steps needed to realistically estimate 
your budget and determine the approximate likely donation amounts.
Figuring How Much Your 
Project Will Cost
The first step in determining your fundraising goal for your 
Kickstarter campaign is determining the scope of your project: 
	
✓	Are you trying to raise enough funds to complete an entire 
project all the way to the end? If you’re seeking backers to 
complete an entire project, you need a rough estimation of 
the complete campaign, not just a jump-start, before you begin 
setting up your campaign (as outlined in Chapter 5).
	
✓	Is your goal to simply raise enough to launch your project 
or to take it to the next level? Think briefly about your entire 
project as you envision it in its completed form. Would there 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
48
be a natural set of milestones en route to launching the project? 
For example, would you need funds to buy some essential 
equipment? Would money be needed to rent gallery space or 
studio time? These would be major milestones that the funding 
must reach before you can move farther along in the project. 
One or more of these milestones could be a good goal to 
shoot for when you’re raising funds to launch the project.
One of the best tools for estimating a project budget is to use an 
Excel spreadsheet or other charting/calculation software. Using a 
software program is recommended over hand-tabulating potential 
costs for several reasons:
	
✓	A spreadsheet is easier to update and modify.
	
✓	A spreadsheet can calculate totals for your budget line items 
more accurately.
	
✓	You can share a spreadsheet with potential backers.
	
✓	You can also back up a spreadsheet file for added protection.
	
This section focuses on estimating expenses for your project. 
Remember that, if your campaign is successful, Kickstarter will 
also charge you 5 percent of the money you raise and Amazon 
will charge you credit card processing fees. When you finalize 
your overall budget spreadsheet, remember to take these fees 
into account and make sure they won’t leave you short of funds to 
finish your project and deliver your rewards.
Outlining broad expense categories
You probably already have a rough estimate of the elements 
needed to complete your project; this may be the result of past 
experience with similar projects or knowledge of other projects in 
your industry. Even so, it’s important to create a comprehensive, 
specific budget for your new project to ensure that you’re asking 
for the correct amount.
Start your spreadsheet for tabulating estimated costs with six main 
categories:
	
✓	Research/Licenses/Permits
	
✓	Equipment to rent (including space)
	
✓	Equipment to buy
	
✓	Staff hours or temporary help

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 49
	
✓	Production
	
✓	Marketing
As shown in Figure 3-1, the preceding six categories will give you a 
starting point for dropping in estimated costs and help you think 
about things you haven’t considered yet. The equipment to rent or 
buy are listed as hard costs, meaning you have to spend money to 
make them part of your project.
Figure 3-1: A template Excel spreadsheet for estimating costs.
Listing individual expenses
Once you have started a spreadsheet with the six categories, it’s 
time to start listing individual expenses one by one.
Your expenses will differ, depending on the type of project. For 
example:
	
✓	For a photography project, you may need to purchase or buy 
lighting equipment or rent studio time.
	
✓	For a film, you might have to hire extras or pay an editor to 
put the rough video together.
	
✓	For a musical performance, you may need an accompanist or 
specific instruments to make your vision a reality.
	
✓	For production of a table lamp, you may have to pay a manu­
facturing company to produce a plastic prototype or mold.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
50
	
Your spreadsheet is a good way to start thinking about costs, but 
you should refer to it several times before finalizing your budget, 
thinking about things you might have forgotten. For example, you 
might flesh out your list of expenses as follows:
	
1.	In your spreadsheet, spend about 20 minutes listing the 
first things that come to your mind in each category; then 
put the list away. 
	
2.	An hour later, reopen the file and look at the list; try to 
add at least one item to each category. 
	
3.	The next day, examine your list one last time, attempting 
to determine what elements you missed the previous two 
times.
	
	 Figure 3-2 shows a rough-draft Excel spreadsheet with as 
many potential project expenses as possible for a fictional 
photographer who wants to make a book.
Figure 3-2: Sample spreadsheet with expenses listed but no costs.
Trying to estimate those costs
After creating your list of expenses, it’s important to make your 
estimated cost as accurate as possible. Especially if you’ve never 
made a creative project like the one you’re interested in launching 
through Kickstarter, estimating your costs might seem difficult. 
However, if you’ve built a spreadsheet as I’ve described in the 

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 51
preceding sections, you’re well on your way. The following sections 
provide guidelines and ideas for making realistic estimates for 
each expense category.
Figure 3-3 shows an expanded project-cost spreadsheet with actual 
costs estimated in and added up.
Figure 3-3: Expanded project spreadsheet with estimated costs.
Research, licenses, and permits
Permits and licenses are typically fixed (hard) costs. To estimate 
the cost, contact your local, state, or regional agencies, depending 
on where you plan to work. For research, determine whether you 
need to pull up old magazine or newspaper articles, access news­
paper databases, buy copies of previous recordings, and so on. 
Then attempt to estimate the costs involved, basing your figure on 
current pricing listed (usually through the source’s website).
Equipment rentals or purchases
For hard costs— such as things you need to buy or rent — try to 
get as firm a quote as possible. For example:
	
✓	Call the studio where you want to record and get its current 
hourly rate. Then estimate how many hours you expect you’ll 
need.
	
✓	Research camera lighting through Amazon or Google for a 
ballpark figure.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
52
	
Be sure to try and get the most accurate pricing possible direct 
from the source. Do not use Internet chat rooms, blogs, or message 
boards as your sole source of information for costs; these might 
be good for estimates, but you will need to check those figures 
against real-world pricing.
Staff
For hiring extras or basic assistance that does not require educa­
tion or training, estimate 20 percent above the minimum wage of 
your state per hour and multiply that by the number of hours you 
think you will use the help. 
Say, for example, you expect you’ll need 2 assistants for 2 full-day, 
8-hour shoots. And you assume the minimum wage in the U.S. is 
$7.25 per hour (which is correct as this book goes to press). The 
calculation for your estimate looks like this:
2 × 16 × $7.25 = $232
Your project may require additional skilled staff for part or all of 
your duration. For example, you might need to hire an additional 
camera person, a sound technician, editors, makeup artists, and so 
on. As you estimate these costs for your spreadsheet, the following 
resources can help:
	
✓	Job search sites: Do some basic research on sites such as 
Craigslist.org or Monster.com to see whether rates are pub­
lished for positions in these categories. 
	
✓	Industry message boards and websites: You can also search 
Google, using phrases such as “average hourly rate for 
makeup artist” (specify your hometown) to see aggregate 
amounts on message boards or industry websites.
	
✓	Quotes from local professionals: You might want to also 
place a few phone calls when creating your budget to local 
skilled staff in your hometown to get their current hourly or 
daily rates for comparison.
Often these professionals are hired on a daily or half-day rate, so 
factor in the number of days you might need each type of staff and 
enter those values in your spreadsheet.
Production
Beyond the costs required to create all your raw materials, you 
may have an additional “production” cost, or a cost to put your 

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 53
project together in its finished format. This could mean using soft­
ware to run video clips together, printing a finished book, produc­
ing CDs/DVDs, mass-producing your actual finished product (if in 
the design category), and so forth.
This part of the budgeting process can be the most complicated 
and often under-estimated. This is a good point to stop and look 
at your overall Kickstarter campaign and again ask yourself, Am I 
seeking backers to just launch me on my way, or am I seeking fund­
ing for the entire project from beginning to end? If the answer is the 
latter (funding for the whole project), you need to have a realistic 
budget item for production.
Production is categorized as everything that is not a hard line item 
(that is, fixed cost) as listed earlier; it’s not hiring staff, securing 
location permits, paying for props or designers. It’s that nebulous 
“finishing” step that takes the project from a raw product to a 
ready-for-delivery product or a prototype to a production model.
Since each Kickstarter project is different, there is no hard-and-fast 
rule for estimating your production cost. You will need to estimate 
based on your actual project. The best way to do this is to actually 
get estimates in advance — during this budgeting process — and 
not to wait until after all your raw materials have been gathered or 
produced.
Some examples of trying to estimate production costs include the 
following:
	
✓	Getting a firm manufacturing quote from at least three different 
suppliers if your design product requires mass production.
	
✓	Researching the cost of hiring a software expert or editing 
expert for the finished product; give this person a production 
overview and outline of the finished product (how many min­
utes, how many songs, and other such details that affect the 
amount of consulting time) and get a firm quote.
	
✓	Get at least three printing quotes — from different types of 
printers — if you’re making a book, comic or magazine; give 
the printing company as specific a set of requirements as 
possible, including number of pages, color requirements, 
cover type, and quantities.

Marketing
	
Your campaign budget needs to include dollars to promote your 
end result. After you complete a successful Kickstarter campaign 
and make the finished creative piece, you need to get out there and 
sell it!
Marketing and promotion is an extremely broad expense — in some 
cases, the sky is the limit. But start with the basics. At the very 
minimum, you should include the following costs in your project 
budget:
	
✓	Creating and maintaining a website
	
✓	Hosting a launch party, or a viewing or screening event
	
✓	Mailing samples of your product to reporters, writers, and 
bloggers
	
✓	Participating in fairs/festivals that showcase creative work
	
✓	Advertising (if relevant)
	
	If the audience for a specific publication, website, or news 
source would be interested in your finished piece, research 
their advertising costs in advance by requesting a media kit.
In Chapter 6, I examine ways to market and promote your 
Kickstarter campaign. The details in that chapter can also help you 
estimate your costs.
Examining other Kickstarter 
campaigns
So you have entered as many possible expenses as you could think 
of and estimated their cost. This gave you a project estimate of . . . 
what? $100? $1,000? $10,000? How do you know if this figure is real­
istic or completely off the mark?
There’s no exact way to know whether your budget is correct, but 
it’s important to examine other campaigns in your category at this 
point. The following steps walk you through the overall process:
	
1.	Go to www.kickstarter.com. 
	
	 On the right, you see a list of all 13 possible project 
categories. 

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 55
	
2.	Click the category you think your project will most likely 
fall under. 
	
	 In Figure 3-4, I clicked Games, which highlighted the staff 
picks for the Games category in the center of the page. 
	
	 Refer to Chapter 2 if you need help deciding what category 
is best for your project. 
	
3.	Click the option labeled See All (Number) (Category) 
Projects, as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
	 For example, See All 281 Games Projects. The number will 
vary depending on the projects available at any one time. 
	
	 All the projects in your category appear, as shown in 
Figure 3-5.

5.	When you notice a project that’s similar to yours, note 
the funding goal. How much does that project’s goal 
differ from yours? 
	
	 If you see dramatic differences between your potential 
budget and others in your likely category, it doesn’t neces­
sarily mean your budget is wrong, but it may mean you 
should re-evaluate some of your elements. 
	
6.	Read these project descriptions to see whether a similar 
project mentions costs that you haven’t thought of yet.
 
•	If your estimate is noticeably lower than those of 
similar projects: Are you setting yourself up to fall 
short? Potentially you haven’t considered hidden 
costs, so look thoroughly at these campaigns to 
see whether something strikes you as a cost you 
haven’t identified.
 
• If your funding goal is substantially higher than 
those of other projects in your category: Perhaps 
you’re being overly ambitious in your estimated 
number of backers or the number of units you might 
sell or produce. Examine these projects and check 
how many products they distributed, how many back­
ers they actually received at each level, and so on.
Estimating Potential Donations
When determining your overall project budget, you must also esti­
mate backer pledges.
	
Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing model, so if you don’t get to your 
project goal, you get none of the pledges.
You can’t estimate your pledges as accurately as you can estimate 
your project costs. But you can make a well-informed guess by 
following this overall process:
	
1.	Make a very basic list of people you could consider, off 
the top of your head, as potential backers. 
	
2.	Use your project’s cost estimate to evaluate how many 
backers you’d need at different levels. Evaluate whether 
these levels suit the people on your list of potential 
backers.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
58
	
3.	Consider what rewards might interest your potential 
backers and the donation amount you could connect to 
each reward.
In the sections that follow, you find details and tips for working 
through each of these steps.
Who you gonna call?
It’s not just the signature line from a classic 1980s movie about a 
team of paranormal hunters. Figuring out who your potential back­
ers are is a key step to Kickstarter success. Like it or not, most of 
your backers will be people with some personal connection to you, 
not total strangers. It’s time to generate a contact list. 
Creating your contact list before you submit your project to 
Kickstarter for review has several advantages, in addition to helping 
you estimate your potential donations: Your contact list may spark 
creative ideas for rewards or changes to your project overview.
The first step in building your potential backer list is looking at all 
the elements of your life:
	
✓	Your family: It’s true that blood is thicker than water. Top 
of your potential solicitation list should be every member of 
your family, including parents, grandparents, siblings, cous­
ins, second cousins, aunts, uncles, godparents . . . you get the 
idea! 
	
✓	Your second family: We often spend more of our days with 
our co-workers than with actual family members. If you have 
good social relationships with your co-workers, consider 
them as a source for your first list of potential backers.
	
✓	Your community: Are you active in a religious organization, 
volunteer group, or other club? You might not think of this 
group as potential backers, but dozens of potential individuals 
in these groups would likely want to see your project succeed. 
You may also have a large online community — separate from 
a Facebook or Twitter account. Maybe you post actively and 
have Pinterest boards? Do you post in user groups or mes­
sage boards? These could also be places to find additional 
backers.
	
✓	Your industry: An important group to consider is the industry 
in which your project falls. For example, if you want to make 
a film, your backer list might include film societies, clubs, 

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 59
professional groups, festival organizers, and more. The case 
study at the end of this chapter (see “The Order of the Stick: 
Building on a Fan Base and Offering Creative Rewards”) looks 
at an excellent example of a campaign owner working heavily 
with industry leaders and creating a rallying effect around the 
project.
	
Think outside the proverbial box when it comes to ideas to locate 
potential backers. Look at everyone you come in contact over the 
course of the week and think about whether they might be interested 
in your project. Who knows? Your hairstylist might be a secret 
comic book enthusiast who would love to back your project that 
creates a new comic superhero who cuts hair in a flash!
Evaluate your potential 
reward levels
In this step, you experiment with reward levels until you find a 
comfortable spot for reward levels that your backers might actually 
fund. Here’s how this works:
	
1.	Divide your estimated project cost by several numbers. 
Start with 5, 10, 25, 50, 100. 
	
	 Doing this will help you guesstimate the potential number 
of backers you would need at each level to reach your 
goal. For example, the total project cost for the film project 
featured earlier in this chapter is $2,782. Table 3-1 outlines 
how many backers you’d need at a few basic backer levels:
Table 3-1

$10
279
$25
112
$50
56
$100
28

Kickstarter For Dummies

	 You might also want to consider some backer levels that may 
be significant to your project. For example, in my campaign 
for The Finding 40 Project, I had (of course) a backer level 
of $40 for individuals to preorder a copy of the book. If you 
are working on a film in 2013 and hope to premiere it at a 
2014 film festival, a $14 pledge might be a natural fit.
	
2.	Return to your backer list and consider who might back 
you at these different amounts.
	
	 If it becomes obvious that you’ll need thousands of backers 
at a $5 or $10 level — or even a hundred backers at a $50 
pledge or more — and if this seems unreasonable to ask of 
the folks on your target list, consider lowering your overall 
project goal by 10 to 25 percent and re-calculating before 
you move on to Step 3.
	
	 To lower your overall project goal without dramatically 
changing the scope of your project, consider how your 
Kickstarter campaign might just “kick-start” your project 
rather than fund it completely. You might want to lower the 
number of finished copies of your project, limit the scope 
of what you’re producing, or realize that this campaign will 
only fund the first half of a film or project. Here are some 
specific ideas:
 
• Use the Kickstarter campaign to create a trailer or 
teaser for a feature film instead of the entire finished 
production.
 
•	Produce the first in a series of comic books, instead of 
an entire run.
 
• Produce a single prototype for your design element, 
realizing that you’ll then have to get a loan, attract 
an investor, or launch another Kickstarter campaign 
to fund production once you’ve built a buzz for the 
product.
	
3.	If you seem to have enough potential backers to meet 
your project cost estimate, try working out specific goals 
for each backer level. 
	
	 For example, if you have a list of 300 potential backers, the 
$5 donation level is probably too low (because you’d need 
557 of them to reach your goal, or 279 — pretty much your 
whole backer list — to reach even half of your goal). You 
have a better chance of funding your project if you have a 
handful of $100 or $50 backers and a larger pool of $25 and 
$10 backers. Continuing with the film example, you could 
play with the numbers as shown in Table 3-2.

	 Using an example like this, you can see the impact even a 
few larger backers have at reaching your goal and also the 
combined impact of a few more backers at the lower levels. 
In the second row of Table 3-2, you see how just adding a 
few more $50 backers takes you well over your fundraising 
goal without dramatically increasing your overall number 
of backers. 
Rewarding your backers
Like it or not, almost no one does something for nothing. A very 
small percentage of your backers will support your campaign 
without expecting anything in return, but not most. Thankfully, 
Kickstarter lets you create a series of rewards to say “thank you” 
to those who back your project and want to see you succeed.
Now that you’ve built your contact list, determined that your list 
of contacts could realistically support your fundraising goal, and 
experimented with the levels of support you need, you’re ready to 
start thinking about possible rewards at each level of support.
Kickstarter allows you to set rewards at any level, from $1 to 
$10,000 (or more) and to also limit the number of backers at any 
one level. 
	
The following tips can help you fine-tune the different levels of 
support for your rewards:
	
✓	Start with four reward amounts. You can always add more 
before your campaign goes live.
	
✓	Estimate who might contribute at each level. As a basic 
guideline, think about the potential backers on your list. 
How many will be willing and able to give $5? $25? $50? $100? 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
62
The likelihood of the number of backers to donate a certain 
amount will help you determine where to set your levels.
	
✓	Make sure one option is a low amount. Because Kickstarter 
is a crowdfunding site that’s designed to let as many people 
as possible into your project, you don’t want to set your start­
ing reward too high!
After creating a list of your goals for your different backer levels, you 
need to associate a reward that goes with each amount. Your rewards 
should correlate to the dollar value invested by the backers, meaning 
your best rewards should be saved for your largest backers.
	
Be sure you factor in the cost of your reward when setting the 
reward level; do not promise a CD to a $10 backer if it costs $15 to 
produce and deliver each one!
	
No matter the dollar value, each reward should offer something 
that has a personal meaning for your backer. These rewards are 
designed to thank a backer for support of your project, not anyone 
else’s. Consequently, rewards should be directly related to the 
project, not just a random reward. For example, a personal thank-
you card showing an image from your project would be ideal.
The following list offers just a few sample ideas of rewards at 
various levels. I provide a list of other creative backer rewards in 
Chapter 9:
	
✓	$1 – $5 Backers:
 
• A thank-you on your project’s website
 
• A personal thank-you card
 
• The backer’s name listed in the finished product
 
• The backer’s name in the credits
	
✓	$10 – $25 Backers:
 
• Electronic versions of your finished product (e-book, 
CD/DVD, download)
 
• Invitations to a performance event
 
• Invitations to a VIP party for the project
	
✓	$25 – $50 Backers:
 
• Printed versions of your finished product (book, comic 
book, photos)
 
• Finished versions of games, toys
 
• Signed copies of printed versions

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 63
	
✓	$100-and-up Backers:
 
• Printed thank-yous in project foreword or on the cover 
or jacket
 
• Combo packs of e-versions of your project, as well as 
finished products
 
• Multiple copies of a project to give as gifts
	
The list of potential ideas for backers is nearly limitless; if you can 
think of a creative way to say “thank you,” do it! 
Figures 3-7, 3-8, and 3-9 show three examples of creative or person­
alized ways to reward backers: creating a villain, inviting backers 
to a premiere screening, and cooking a gourmet meal.

The Order of the Stick: Building 
on a Fan Base and Offering 
Creative Rewards
Earlier in this chapter, you find out about the importance of 
assessing your fan base and offering rewards as you figure out 
your fundraising goal and project budget. In this section, you see 
how a successful Kickstarter campaign for The Order of the Stick, 
organized by the comic’s creator Rich Burlew, used both of these 
elements.
The Order of the Stick wasn’t a new product when it launched on 
Kickstarter; it had started in 2003 as a once-in-a-while strip on 
Burlew’s personal web page, shown in Figure 3-10. Created as a 
satirical version of a Dungeons and Dragons type game, this comic 
features stick-figure style characters competing in a fantasy role-
playing scenario. Over time, the comic expanded to several times a 
week and grew a very large following. 

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 65
Figure 3-10: The Order of the Stick main web page.
In 2005, Burlew began publishing the comic in printed form in basic 
books. For several years, he published the comic books through 
his own production house. However, this proved extremely expen­
sive and eventually he found himself unable to continue produc­
tion, fronting all the costs himself for each run.
From his own posts on his Kickstarter page, Burlew said: “I’ve been 
self-publishing my comedy-fantasy-adventure web comic The Order 
of the Stick in paper format since 2005, but one of the hardest parts 
about doing it all on my own is keeping the older books available. 
This project is designed to get at least one of those books back 
into print.”
Figure 3-11 shows a sample of a previously printed book.
In January 2012, Burlew launched a Kickstarter campaign to get 
his books back into production. His goal was $57,750, enough to 
reprint a select run of books. But as you can see in Figure 3-12, he 
ended up with more than 20 times his goal, raising $1,254,120. The 
campaign raised more than enough to reprint the entire series of 
all the books published up to that point, as well as fund eight new 
titles to be published over the next year.

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 67
Building on a fan base
The Order of the Stick had spent several years before the 
Kickstarter campaign building a fan base. Through publication of 
the other comic strips and printed books, Burlew had an exist­
ing network of thousands of followers through the strip’s existing 
website (www.giantitp.com). This website has a daily average of 
150,000 individual page views, giving it a large viewership.
Burlew launched his Kickstarter campaign through his website, 
communicating directly to his fan base, as shown in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13: Launching a Kickstarter campaign directly through a post 
on creator’s own website.
The Order of the Stick was also already a part of several existing 
online communities focused on role-playing and web comics — 
and received exposure for its Kickstarter campaign on ComicsBeat, 
as shown in Figure 3-14.
As recommended in Chapter 6, Facebook is a great way to com­
municate with your potential backer group and spread the word 
about your Kickstarter campaign. Because Order of the Stick was an 
established product with an existing fan base on Facebook, posting 
heavily on the strip’s Facebook page and providing a link to the 
Kickstarter campaign (as shown in Figure 3-15) was a logical choice.

68

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 69
Chapter 6 goes into detail about spreading the word about your 
Kickstarter campaign among your communities after your cam­
paign launches. However, it’s never too early to begin thinking 
about who all your potential supporters are — and where you 
might connect with them.
Getting creative with rewards
Another reason this campaign was so successful was the extreme 
diversity and variety of pledge levels and backer rewards. It wasn’t 
just a few high-rolling backers giving tens of thousands of dollars 
to meet this goal; it was thousands of individual smaller backers — 
which is the true power of crowdfunding.
Here’s a small sampling of the more than 50 different reward-and-
pledge combinations:
	
✓	$10 (lowest reward available, 2,256 sold): A Roy Greenhilt 
fridge magnet, exclusive to this pledge drive, shipped any­
where in the world. Plus a digital PDF of the original Order of 
the Stick story, “How the Paladin Got His Scar,” when it is com­
pleted. (Note: All rewards below this level include the digital 
download as well.)
	
✓	$26 reward (772 sold): One newly printed copy of On the 
Origin of PCs plus a Roy Greenhilt magnet, shipped anywhere 
in the United States.
	
✓	$49 reward (74 sold): PATIENCE for a SIGNED PRINT: The 8x10 
art print, autographed by the author, plus the Roy Greenhilt 
magnet and the coloring book and stuff. Add any one signed 
book for an additional $45. 
	
✓	$240 reward (25 sold): A complete set of all 8 limited-edition 
Order of the Stick (OOTS) holiday ornaments from 2004 to 
2011, signed by the artist, Rich Burlew, plus a Roy Greenhilt 
magnet. Add one signed copy of every OOTS book for $262.
	
✓	$675 reward (10 sold): PATIENCE for YOUR D&D PARTY: An 
original full-color crayon drawing of your D&D party (or party 
from another RPG, up to 6 characters) based on your descrip­
tions, made and signed by Rich Burlew and shipped anywhere 
in the world, plus six Roy Greenhilt magnets, six of all the 
other free stuff, six art prints, six patches, and one copy of the 
Sticky Shticks expansion.

At the top end of the spectrum, several Order of the Stick rewards 
showcase the possibility of high-end backers pledging large 
amounts to truly get involved with the project:
With countless characters in the series, one of the rewards was the 
option to choose a character to feature in a new story; three back­
ers chose this reward as shown on the left in Figure 3-16.
One backer even selected the highest-level reward ($5,000), giving 
the backer an opportunity to actually create an original Order of 
the Stick character, working directly with the creator, as shown on 
the right in Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-16: (Left) Backers choosing which characters return 
in the new series as part of the Order of the Stick Kickstarter 
campaign. (Right) This top-level reward featuring the opportunity 
to create your own character for The Order of the Stick.
	
What makes these rewards so successful? Here are a few key points 
to take away from The Order of the Stick’s successful campaign:
	
✓	There were many levels to choose from.
	
✓	Rewards built upon each other, making the jumps in backer 
levels worthwhile.
	
✓	The rewards were different enough to have something for 
every type of fan.

 Chapter 3: Deciding How Much to Ask For 71
	
✓	There was a sense of urgency (some rewards only had very 
limited availability).
	
✓	Many of the rewards were for pledges under $50, allowing a 
large number of backers to get involved.
Throwing in the perks
Another area where The Order of the Stick was successful was throw­
ing in perks — added features that served as premiums at various 
backer levels. What made these add-ons extremely successful is 
they usually came with an additional backer contribution.
For example, if you chose a backer reward at $25, you could upsell 
the pledge to $30 in exchange for adding another book to your 
reward. This incrementally small increase in rewards allowed 
the campaign creator to increase his overall funding by slightly 
enhancing the amount each donor pledged. 
Figure 3-17 shows a backer perk for raising the pledge by just $5.

Chapter 4
Creating a Realistic Timeline
In This Chapter
▶	Estimating delivery dates for your rewards
▶	Timing your rewards just right
▶	Setting deadlines you can meet despite ups and downs 
O

ne of the largest stumbling blocks Kickstarter users encoun­
ter, besides setting a realistic project budget, is the looming 
deadline: You have to deliver your Kickstarter project on time.
When you set up your campaign (as I explain in Chapter 5), you 
need to indicate when you expect to deliver your product — and 
each of your backer rewards. Although, as I write this, Kickstarter 
does not enforce any regulations requiring campaign owners to 
deliver finished products or rewards at the times indicated on the 
campaign’s page, you still have to answer to your backers. 
In the past few months, there have been several stories in the 
press and online about frustration with successful Kickstarter 
campaigns that still have not delivered the promised items. The 
following two examples of successful Kickstarter projects were 
either very late with their delivery or still have not delivered at all, 
resulting in bad press:
	
✓	Double Fine Adventure: This campaign for the creation of a 
classic “point-and-click adventure” computer game reached 
its $400,000 goal on the first day. Quickly, word spread and in 
the end, the campaign raised $3.3 million.
	
	Although this was a great problem to have, the company 
couldn’t cope. Angry backers started posting on the project’s 
Kickstarter page, and reporters started to write about it. In an 
article on CNNMoney, the campaign creators said, “Originally 
it was three people working for six months on a bite-sized 
game.” Instead, the company grew to 12 people. As the proj­
ect’s scale grew out of control, the campaign owners could no 
longer meet their deadlines. Later in this chapter, I talk about 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
74
how to plan for potential scale-up issues if your campaign is 
very successful.
	
	The team behind Double Fine Adventure, while needing to 
spread the word about their project’s success to people 
other than their Kickstarter backers, needed also to stay in 
very close contact with their backer pool, since these were 
the people making their project a reality. Figure 4-1 shows 
a small sample of the 17 updates posted on the campaign’s 
Kickstarter page that were designated “for backers only.” 
Keeping these updates private also helped maintain a sense 
of community and backers feeling like they were really “in the 
know” about the project’s true status.
	
✓	Printrbot: This cleverly designed all-in-one printer enables 
users to print their own 3-D plastic pieces for modeling pro­
totypes. The campaign more than beat its goal in early 2012. 
However, the company was more than three months late 
in starting the fulfillment process, and some rewards were 
almost six months late. Some backers became so upset with 
the delay that the company ended up refunding about $20,000 
of the $830,000 raised in the campaign.
Obviously, it’s best to avoid bad press (and bad sentiments among 
your backers) by setting and sticking to the most realistic dates 
you can — up front. The dates you enter into your campaign page 
are what set the public’s expectations for your project. 
Figure 4-1: Backer only updates on Double Fine Adventure’s Kickstarter page.

 Chapter 4: Creating a Realistic Timeline 75
To help you deliver your product — and any rewards that you offer 
in addition to your product — this chapter helps you to develop a 
realistic estimated timeline before you launch your campaign.
Creating a Timeline 
for Your Campaign
Why is it important for you to have a realistic timeline for your 
project?
	
✓	It gives you a structure to work from.
	
✓	Firm deadlines help ensure forward progress.
	
✓	Backers may feel cheated if you don’t deliver on time.
	
✓	Sticking to a timeline and delivering as promised creates a 
track record of honesty that can help you with any future 
Kickstarter campaigns.
In this section, I help you determine when your finished product 
will be available. This process is especially important if you’re using 
Kickstarter to fund complete production of an item or project.
To start, you need the project budget you created, as I discuss 
in Chapter 3. Ideally, your budget is in a spreadsheet format so 
you can easily add time estimates next to each item. When you 
have your budget ready, go through each individual item you’ve 
budgeted for and note the estimated number of days, weeks, or 
months it will take to complete that step. Also, make a note of 
whether you’ll need any resource on a specific date or for a certain 
timeframe.
If you’re already familiar with a project-management tool such as 
Microsoft Project or have a fairly complex production process with 
multiple team members and dependencies for deliverables, you 
might be more comfortable using Project to manage a timeline, 
either in conjunction with or instead of a spreadsheet. If you are 
interested in using Microsoft Project, check out Project 2013 For 
Dummies by Cynthia Stackpole Snyder. Or to get a sense for what 
Project can do, point your browser to Dummies.com for free arti­
cles about setting up timelines and other features in Project.
	
Here are some tips for estimating time and spotting date-dependent 
items for the different types of items you have in your spreadsheet:

Kickstarter For Dummies 
76
	
✓	Permits and licenses: Some permits and licenses are easier 
to obtain than others. Talk to the agency issuing the permit 
about how long processing of your application or request 
might take. Don’t make an assumption or a guess, even if you 
think you’re making a conservative one.
	
✓	Equipment: If you’re planning to rent equipment, make sure 
you can rent it for the timeframe in which you have speci­
fied. Find out how far in advance to reserve any items you 
need. Discuss the lender’s policy on whether you can keep 
the equipment a few more days if needed. This is especially 
important if your production totally depends on having the 
equipment available. If you have to wait until another renter 
is done before you can borrow the equipment again, that turn-
waiting has the potential to substantially delay your project. 
	
✓	Staff: If you need to coordinate the schedules of several other 
people, do your best to communicate when those people need 
to be available for your project and ask them to confirm that 
they’ll be available when you need them. If you need to wait 
for a key member to return from a trip or fulfill another com­
mitment first, that will have a direct impact on your project 
timeline and delivery dates. It’s wise to talk with potential 
staff in advance of launching your project to understand what 
their schedules are and where delays might occur. That way, 
you can adjust the overall schedule ahead of time instead of 
midway through your project.
	
✓	Production: If you’re doing the production yourself, try to 
map out the specific steps in your process as clearly as pos­
sible and consider how much time each step takes as well 
as how much free time you can devote to the production if 
you’re working around another schedule.
	
	If your Kickstarter campaign is in support of producing a 
physical item for mass distribution, be sure to include pro­
duction quotes that cover a range of quantities. You may 
be hoping to produce only 100 copies of your comic book; 
however, if your campaign is very successful and you have 
1,000 or 10,000 or more backers who want a copy of your 
book, you’ll need to produce those just as quickly as you were 
planning to produce the original 100. When you get a produc­
tion estimate for something like printing, make sure you get 
an idea of how long it would take to create more copies than 
you originally estimated of a product. The case studies of 
Elevation Dock and Pebble E-Paper Watch, later in this chap­
ter, illustrate how a successful campaign can create timeline 
problems during production.

✓	Working around a day job: It’s important to not overpack 
this timeline, because you’ll still need time to take care of 
everyday business and your day job. Life happens and that’s 
part of the process.
When you’re done creating a rough time estimate for each item in 
your project, the following process can help you create an estimated 
timeline for the project overall:
	
1.	Count up the total number of days/weeks/months each 
part requires.
	
	 You now have an estimation of the possible total number of 
days required to complete the elements requested in your 
Kickstarter campaign.
	
2.	Note which elements in your project have time constraints.
	
	 Maybe some parts of the project are only available on cer­
tain days. This could be the case if you’re working around a 
specific event, facility restrictions, personal commitments, 
and so on.
	
3.	Now, take out a calendar and mark your anticipated 
launch date of your campaign.
	
	 This doesn’t have to be exact, just a guesstimate to allow 
you to plan.
	
4.	Using the anticipated start date, move forward in time 
with all the days you’ve added up and take into account 
days that might be unavailable or dates you need to 
include in your project. 
	
	 For example, if you’re making a film about an athlete com­
peting in a sporting event and want to film him or her in 
competition, take into account that you’ll have to film 
those days specifically; you can’t film those scenes any 
sooner than the days on which they’re happening. You also 
can’t start editing or production until after you have that 
footage — so even if you’ve estimated (say) 21 days for 
editing, those 21 days can’t begin until after you’ve filmed 
the raw materials.
	
	 Using the calendar to set a start date and a total of antici­
pated days (as estimated here), you should be able to calcu­
late your estimated delivery date for your finished product.
	
	
The estimated delivery date calculated here is probably 
too optimistic, no matter what your project. Even so, don’t 
worry — almost everyone underestimates how long it will 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
78
take to get a project completed! Remember, once you input 
your delivery dates in your Kickstarter campaign, they 
cannot be changed. If you successfully fund your campaign 
and it becomes obvious you will not be able to meet your 
stated deadlines, you will need to communicate that to 
backers through updates as soon as possible. Chapter 8 
discusses ways to post updates and communicate with 
your backers about potential delays and other issues.
	
5.	Take your estimated delivery date and push it out by at 
least two weeks.
	
	 There’s no harm in delivering a finished product early. 
However, your backers will become disillusioned if they 
continue to wait and wait and wait for the reward.
Staggering the Reward Dates
One of the beautiful things about Kickstarter is that it allows you 
to be flexible, setting different delivery dates for different levels of 
rewards.
Because you’re going to be setting up a campaign that allows 
backers to pledge at varying levels, you can offer different types 
of rewards, some more complex to deliver than others. Chapter 
3 helps you figure out backer levels and rewards; in Chapter 5, 
you find out how to set up rewards information on your campaign 
dashboard. This section focuses on estimating the timing for the 
delivery of your rewards. You can most likely divide your rewards 
into two categories:
	
✓	Rewards that are tied to your absolute finished product: 
These include tickets to a film’s screening, copies of a finished 
design product, printed books, gallery showings, and so on. 
You can use your estimated delivery date for these types of 
rewards.
	
✓	Rewards you can deliver without the entire finished project: 
These rewards include thank-you cards, credits on a project’s 
website, delivery of photos from a project in process, and so 
forth.
When you’re setting up your rewards (as outlined in Chapter 5), 
be sure to think about which rewards you can deliver sooner than 
the finished-product date that you estimated. If you can promise 
an e-book version of your project before a printed version and the 
e-book is at a different reward level, make the e-book’s delivery 
date a little sooner. Also be sure to consider whether your rewards 

 Chapter 4: Creating a Realistic Timeline 79
require extra time to make. For example, if a reward requires you 
to make many copies of a handmade thank-you card or personal­
ized piece of art, factor the time required to make those rewards 
into your delivery dates.
	
Announcing a series of reward dates — and then delivering on 
them, leading up to your ultimate product delivery — shows prog­
ress and reliability.
Experiencing Success 
and Then Delays
Both the iPhone Elevation Dock and Pebble E-Paper Watch were 
extremely successful campaigns that also generated a lot of 
unhappy backers because of unrealistic production deadlines. For 
both of these products, the campaign owners failed to take into 
account the production time required for a large amount of their 
products.
iPhone Elevation Dock
The iPhone Elevation Dock campaign (which I introduce in Chapter 
2) blew its goal out of the water when it concluded in February 
2012. However, it took some time for the physical docks to begin 
shipping. The original Kickstarter campaign promised delivery in 
April 2012, but the first docks did not begin shipping until August, 
and the company has experienced several delays with fulfillment 
and production.
Kickstarter allows you to post multiple updates to everyone — or 
just your backers — through the Post Update function. (I explain 
how it works in Chapter 8.) The Elevation Dock team used the 
Update function to keep everyone posted on the production 
schedule and also to respond to questions. The 23 updates they’ve 
posted to date show production photos and shipping updates as a 
way to prove to backers that their product is coming.
Backers can post comments on the project page — and if they 
are unhappy with failure to deliver, they will let you know! The 
Elevation Dock Kickstarter page alone has over 2,400 comments, 
many from people asking where the product is. As a project cre­
ator, you can also post in the comments and update anyone who 
is reading the comment thread. If you get a complaint in your com­
ment section, be sure to reply to that backer directly — and as 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
80
quickly as possible; you don’t want the same person posting again, 
maybe in a worse mood, that he or she hasn’t heard from you.
	
If you’re exploring a Kickstarter campaign that involves design of 
and delivery of a physical product, be sure to be realistic about 
estimated delivery dates. Anticipate delays in your original produc­
tion timeline and think about backing out your anticipated delivery 
dates by a month or more if possible.
Pebble E-Paper Watch
The Pebble E-Paper Watch was not only successful, it has been 
called the most successful Kickstarter campaign — for one simple 
reason: It beat its original fundraising goal 100 times over.
Some of the most popular campaigns of all time (some listed in this 
book), might well have beaten their goal 10 times over or doubled 
their original asking figure. The Pebble E-Paper Watch started with 
an original campaign goal of $100,000 and ended up raising over 
$10 million.
The product is fairly simple and not necessarily Earth-shattering. 
The watch connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth, alerting 
users to incoming calls and messages with a silent vibration. 
The design, shown in Figure 4-2, was simple and clean, attracting 
both design and tech lovers.
Capitalizing on the apps craze, the E-Paper Watch also offers tools 
that allow you to turn it into a speed/distance computer for your 
bike or a remote control for your music library on your smartphone.
Figure 4-2: Design of the Pebble E-Paper Watch.

 Chapter 4: Creating a Realistic Timeline 81
The product wasn’t new; the company had actually worked suc­
cessfully with venture capitalists to raise hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in the years prior to the Kickstarter campaign. However, 
the initial funding proved insufficient to turn the idea into a reality.
When launched in April 2012, Pebble’s Kickstarter campaign allowed 
backers to preorder an E-Paper Watch for $115 (it would retail for 
$150). Within two hours of its launch, the project had met its original 
$100,000 goal — and eventually had to end its campaign early 
due to fears of being unable to deliver the finished product. The 
Kickstarter campaign closed on May 18, 2012 with 68,928 backers 
totaling $10,266,844 in pledges.
As with the Elevation Dock, the Pebble E-Paper Watch experienced 
some shipping and delivery delays due to its overwhelming 
popularity.
	
Anticipate this potential problem with your project and have a 
plan in place to stay in touch with backers or others who preorder. 
For example, Figure 4-3 shows a page from the Pebble website that 
shows how the company is providing updates and feedback to 
customers who pre-ordered through the Kickstarter campaign.

Setting Up Your Campaign
In This Chapter
▶	Filling out your project details
▶	Creating your biography
▶	Setting up your payment account
▶	Reviewing your campaign one last time
▶	Submitting your campaign to Kickstarter for approval
Y

ou’re excited about your project. You know what makes it 
unique. You’ve prepared a project description and video with 
a distinct call to action. Your list of potential backers is ready. You 
know your project expenses backwards and forwards — and how 
much money you want to raise. You can’t wait to share your cre­
ative rewards with your backers. 
Does this sound like you? If so, you’re definitely ready to set up 
your campaign in Kickstarter and submit it for review. This chap­
ter walks you through the whole process, from creating your 
Kickstarter account to reviewing all the details in your Kickstarter 
dashboard one last time.
	
Even if you don’t have every detail about your campaign com­
pletely nailed down, you might still want to start setting up your 
campaign. The Kickstarter dashboard is extremely flexible, allow­
ing you to fine-tune your project description and figure out the 
financial details of your campaign before submitting it for review. 
Just refer to Chapters 2 and 3 when (for example) you need help 
with your project profile or rewards, and then return to this chap­
ter for the details about adding these campaign elements into your 
Kickstarter dashboard. In fact, the verification of your Amazon 
Payments account and identity can take several days, so you 
might want to get a head start on those details. I explain how each 
works in “Activating Your Payment Account,” later in this chapter. 
Kickstarter’s approval process will also take at least a full day, 
maybe two or three, so be sure to factor that in when you’re decid­
ing how much time you need to start a project.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
84
	
After you submit your project for Kickstarter’s review and 
approval, Kickstarter limits the changes you can make to your 
campaign. This chapter helps you make sure all the details are just 
right before you pass the point where changes aren’t allowed.
As I walk you through the process for setting up your campaign, 
please note the steps and locations of various buttons, tabs, and 
boxes were correct as this book went to press, but online interfaces 
can change quickly, subtly, and without notice. So if a step doesn’t 
work quite the way it’s described, Kickstarter has likely updated 
its interface. Nevertheless, the general advice and overall process 
should still be accurate. You can always check www.dummies.com/
go/kickstarterfdupdates for any updates about major changes.
Kickstarting Your Kickstarter 
Account
Before you can start filling out details about your campaign, you need 
to set up an account with Kickstarter. Simply follow these steps: 
	
1.	On the top of the main Kickstarter page, locate and click 
the blue Start link, shown in Figure 5-1.
	
	 You’re taken to a brief video on how Kickstarter works.
Figure 5-1: Starting to set up your Kickstarter account from the home page.

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 85
	
2.	If you haven’t already, click Play in the middle of the 
video screen to review the introductory video.
	
3.	After watching the video, click the green Start Your 
Project button and click Continue to verify that you meet 
the eligibility requirements for Kickstarter.
	
	 The requirements are listed on screen and you can find an 
overview of Kickstarter’s requirements and guidelines in 
Chapter 1. On the resulting page is where you set up your 
user name and password, or login if you already have a 
Kickstarter account.
	
4.	Set up your user name and password or log in using an 
existing account. 
	
	 You can set up a user name and password unique to 
Kickstarter or log in with Facebook Connect. 
	
	 While setting up your Kickstarter campaign using Facebook 
Connect might save a few steps, I recommend creating your 
own unique Kickstarter login and account. You will have 
the opportunity to link your individual campaign to your 
Facebook account later, so I recommend linking it there if 
you choose to use Facebook to promote your campaign. 
Using Facebook Connect to set up your Kickstarter account 
means your Facebook account is linked to everything you 
do on Kickstarter, as opposed to being able to promote and 
link to a specific campaign. Kickstarter allows you to create 
multiple campaigns off of one login; you may not want to 
link every campaign to your Facebook page if you end up 
doing more than one Kickstarter project.
 
• If you set up a user name and password unique to 
Kickstarter: Determine which e-mail address you’d 
like to use to manage your Kickstarter campaign 
and a public user name -- Ideally your real name so 
friends, family and associates can search for you even 
if they don’t know the official name of your project. 
Set up a strong password by using a combination of 
letters and numbers that’s at least eight characters 
long, doesn’t form a natural word (especially not 
the word password), doesn’t include numbers in 
sequence. 
 
• If you use Facebook Connect: Enter the same login 
information you use for your Facebook account. 
Kickstarter prompts you to set up a password that’s 
unique to your Kickstarter account. 
	
	 When you’re done, you move onto the guidelines page.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
86
	
5.	If you haven’t already done so, read the entire Project 
Guidelines carefully. 
	
	 As I explain in Chapter 1, you want to review the prohibited 
uses to ensure you don’t spend time building a project that 
will not get approved. For example, fundraising for your favor­
ite charity — or promoting a product that is so outrageous 
that it will likely never come to fruition — will probably be 
rejected. 
	
6.	After you acknowledge the Project Guidelines as 
prompted, click Start Your Project again.
	
	 Kickstarter directs you to your project dashboard that 
shows several steps to get your project profile up and 
running. 
	
	 The Guidelines tab on the left gives you quick access to the 
Kickstarter guidelines at any time. The Preview option the 
far right enables you to see how your campaign will look 
to potential backers on the Kickstarter website after your 
campaign launches. 
	
	 Six tabs correlate to the various steps of setting up your 
campaign in Kickstarter:
 
• Basics
 
• Rewards
 
• Story
 
• About You
 
• Account
 
• Review
The remaining sections in this chapter explain everything you 
need to know about filling out each tab.
	
After you set up your account, you can login from the Kickstarter 
home page. Simply click Log In in the upper-right corner and follow 
the prompts.
Filling Out Your Project Profile
When you’re ready to fill out your project profile on the Basics tab, 
shown in Figure 5-2, have all the information you developed and 
fine-tuned in Chapters 2 and 3 handy. Then follow these steps:

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 87
Figure 5-2: You fill out your project profile on the Basics tab of your Kickstarter 
dashboard.
	
1.	In the Project Image area, click the Choose an Image from 
Your Computer link.
	
	 You’re directed to a box where you can select from photos 
anywhere on your computer. 
	
2.	Browse through your files and select the image you have 
chosen to represent your project, keeping in mind the 4:3 
aspect ratio required by Kickstarter.
	
	 If necessary, you may have to load different images until 
you find the one that best fits the 4:3 aspect ratio box 
Kickstarter uses. In addition, your photo needs to meet the 
following requirements:
 
• A file format of JPEG, PNG, GIF, or BMP. The file 
extension (or three letters after the period in a file­
name) tells you a file’s format. If you have a TIF file 
(which is another common image format) or a PSD 
file (which is a proprietary format used in Photoshop 
and Photoshop Elements), you’ll need to convert your 
image to one of the accepted formats in an image-
editing program or ask someone with a little graphics 
knowledge to help you.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
88
 
• At least 640 x 480 pixels, which ensures your image 
will appear clearly onscreen and not look pixilated.
 
• No larger than 10MB, which is pretty large, so your 
image is most likely just fine.
	
3.	Type the name of your project in the box called Project 
Title. 
	
	 See Chapter 2 for help choosing a name. Ideally, the name 
should be relatively short and easy to read in one brief sen­
tence and tie directly to what you’re hoping to accomplish 
with your campaign
	
4.	Choose the category that best fits your project.
	
	 In Chapter 2, I introduce all the standard Kickstarter cat­
egories and the types of project typical in each. Figure 5-3 
shows the Kickstarter Category drop-down menu; move 
your mouse pointer over the appropriate category and 
click to select.
	
5.	Insert your short blurb in the box labeled Short Blurb.
	
	 In Chapter 2, I discussed the importance of making your blurb 
concise and compelling in 135 characters or less. In this box, 
copy and paste the blurb you wrote and character-counted 
in Word.
Figure 5-3: Choosing your Kickstarter category from the drop-down menu.

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 89
	
6.	Fill out the Project Location box with your location or the 
location where the project will take place.
	
	 For example, if you’re shooting a movie on location, place 
the location here. If you’re designing a piece of technology 
in your home town, type that location.
	
7.	Type in the number of days for your project in the box 
labeled Project Duration.
	
	 A 30–60 day window allows you more time to use public 
relations, social media, and events to spread the word if 
appropriate. (There’s more about using these tools to pro­
mote your campaign later in this book.)
	
8.	Enter your funding goal as a dollar figure in the box 
labeled Funding Goal. 
	
	 Figure 5-4 shows where you need to input the goal figure you 
calculated in Chapter 3. Remember that after you submit 
your project to Kickstarter, you cannot change this goal. 
Make sure your zeroes and decimals are all in the right places 
and that you’ve accounted for Kickstarter’s 5 percent fee as 
well as Amazon’s credit card processing fees. I cover check­
ing all the details of your campaign later in this chapter.
	
	 That’s everything you need to include on the Basics tab. 
Click Preview in the upper-right of your dashboard to see how 
your entries will look on your Kickstarter campaign page.

Setting Up Backer Rewards
Before you fill out the Rewards tab, find your list of backer levels, 
the reward for each level, and your estimated delivery dates for 
each reward. (Chapter 3 helps choose rewards and Chapter 4 
helps you map out project timelines.) 
Then fill out each individual reward box on your Kickstarter dash­
board by following these steps:
	
1.	Click the Rewards tab to begin inputting rewards. 
	
	 You start with a blank box labeled Reward #1, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
	
2.	In the Pledge Amount box, input the dollar amount for 
your lowest-value reward.
	
3.	In the Description box, enter a brief description of the 
reward that your backers will receive if they support you 
at the listed dollar amount.
	
4.	Select a month and year for your estimated delivery of 
this reward.
Figure 5-5: Inputting your rewards and dollar amounts into your project.

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 91
	
5.	Select from the following options: Shipping Anywhere in 
the World, Shipping within the US Only, or No Shipping 
Involved.
	
	 If you ship worldwide, you can charge backers outside the 
U.S. a shipping fee. Simply select the Add a Fee check box 
and enter an amount. However, you don’t have the option 
to charge U.S. backers a shipping fee, so make sure that fee 
is included in your cost estimate, as outlined in Chapter 
3. Kickstarter recommends you budget domestic shipping 
into the price of the reward.
	
6.	When you’re ready to enter your next highest reward, 
click the tile labeled Add Another Backer Reward and 
repeat Steps 2–6 until you’ve entered all your rewards.
	
	 Again, click the Preview button in the upper-left corner to 
see how your entries will appear on your campaign page.
Telling Your Project’s Story
On the Story tab, you upload your campaign video, enter your 
long project description, and fill out the Risks and Challenges sec­
tion. Chapter 2 helps you determine what information you need to 
include in each of these elements. 
Uploading your video
When you’re ready to upload your video, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Upload Video button. 
	
2.	Navigate to the video file you previously created and 
saved on your computer.
	
3.	Click the file you want to upload.
	
	 You see a progress bar as the file uploads; once the file is 
completely uploaded, a 100% Complete notification lets 
you know that your video has been successfully uploaded 
to your project profile.
	
4.	Click Preview in the upper-right to check your video and 
make sure you like how it will appear on your campaign 
page.
	
	 If you have the option, consider watching the preview on 
more than one computer to check for possible format issues.

Filling out your project description
If you followed my advice in Chapter 2, you’ve written and reviewed 
all the text and images you want to include in your project descrip­
tion already. You can use all the tools of your word-processing 
software (such as spell checking) to write and review the text. 
Keep in mind, however, that any formatting you apply in a word 
processor tool is stripped out of the text when you paste it into the 
Project Description box in Kickstarter. You also need to use the 
Kickstarter site’s upload tools to insert images, multimedia, and 
links into your project description. 
Here’s a list of the Kickstarter text tools and how they work:
	
✓	Bold: Select the text you want to apply the bold formatting to 
and then select the Bold button above the main text box. To 
remove bold, repeat the same process.
	
✓	Italic: Select the text you want to italicize and click the Italic 
button.
	
✓	Link: This tool works in two ways. You can select text you’ve 
already entered and click the Link button. The text you 
selected then points to the URL. Or you can place the text 
cursor where you want to insert a link, and then click the Link 
button. The URL that you enter then appears linked in the text 
area.
	
✓	Unlink: This tool removes a link. You can select the whole link 
or place the text cursor inside the link. Then click the Unlink 
button to remove the link. The text remains, however, so if 
you want to remove that, use your keyboard.
	
✓	List: This tool applies a bulleted-list treatment. Select the text 
you want to format as a bulleted list and click the List button. 
To remove the formatting, select the bulleted text and click 
the List button again.
	
✓	Heading: You can divide your project description into sec­
tions by adding headings. Place your heading on its own line 
and click the Heading tool. Heading text appears larger and 
bolder so that it stands out from the body text.
To insert multimedia, you have the following tools:
	
✓	Video: Adding video at this point is really adding a link to video 
footage hosted elsewhere; you’re not actually uploading video 
here as you did when you added your Project Video. This 
option allows you to link to supporting videos about your 
project or topic, whether or not you created them. If you click 

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 93
Video here, a pop-up box appears, asking you to paste in a 
web link from either YouTube or Vimeo.
	
✓	Image: Adding images here is different from using the Video 
button. If you click Image, you can either upload an image 
from your computer or enter a website link directly to an 
image from another web page. If you upload your own image, 
you’re directed to choose the file on your computer; after that 
file has uploaded, you’re prompted to enter an optional cap­
tion if you’d like, as well as a click-through link if you would 
like people to be able to view another website that supports 
your project.
	
✓	Audio: Adding audio files or links here is very much like using 
the Image button. You have the option of uploading an audio 
file from your computer, which must be in MP3, MP4, or WAV 
format. You can also choose to link to an existing web page 
here that has audio on it (or an audio-sharing site such as 
SoundCloud or Rdio).
Adding Details about You
The next tab across the top is called About You, and is designed to 
give potential backers a little bit of detail about your background 
and where to connect with you outside of Kickstarter.
	
✓	Profile Photo: This is completely different from any of the 
images you used in your campaign setup; this photo is just a 
photo of you as the creative force behind the campaign. Click 
the box that says “upload an image from your computer” and 
you’re directed to select a photo from your files. Note that the 
photo’s format must be JPEG, PNG, GIF, or BMP and (like your 
project image) the photo must be at least 640 x 480 pixels 
to avoid appearing blurry. The photo cannot be larger than 
10MB, but again, that is a fairly large size so the clarity of the 
image will likely not be an issue.
	
	Select a photo that is fairly closely cropped, ideally a head 
shot or head-and-torso shot; the box showing your photo is 
fairly small. You want backers to be able to see you clearly.
	
✓	Name: This is where you put your full name, so people can 
search by your name as well as your project title.
	
✓	Facebook Connect: If you would like to link your personal 
Facebook page to your project, you can enter the link here; it 
will take backers directly to that Facebook page if they have 
valid Facebook accounts.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
94
	
✓	Biography: This should be a short description about you and 
your experience or background — especially how they relate 
to this project. If you have an existing résumé, bio, or CV, you 
have a good place to pull copy. Keep your biography fairly 
short (400 words or less) and conversational in tone. This 
description should be easy to read and follow, just as if you 
were telling someone you just met about your experience.
	
✓	Your Location: Input your current home town here, so that 
people seeking projects nearby will know you exist.
	
✓	Websites: You can add links here to any external websites 
that give people a sense of your project or passion. Links to 
a blog, professional web page, Facebook company or non-
personal pages, Twitter feed, Pinterest page, and more are 
perfect here! You can enter as many websites as you like; just 
input the URL and click the button that says Add. A new blank 
box appears above the URL you just added; if you want to, 
add another website to the list.
Activating Your Payment Account
Kickstarter uses Amazon Payments to process your backer payments. 
Click the Account tab to begin the process of activating your 
Amazon Payments account.
To be eligible to start a Kickstarter project as a U.S. creator, you 
need to satisfy the requirements of Amazon Payments:
	
✓	You are a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident with either a 
Social Security Number or EIN (employer ID number).
	
✓	You have a U.S. address, U.S. bank account and state-issued ID 
such as a driver’s license.
	
✓	You have a major U.S. credit or debit card.
	
✓	You are at least 18 years old.
If you don’t meet these criteria, you will not be accepted by 
Kickstarter. If you do, gather the necessary materials you will need 
based on the preceding list and then follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the box labeled Amazon Payments and follow the 
link. 

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 95
	
2.	If you don’t have an Amazon Payments account, you’re 
instructed to set one up. 
	
	 Figure 5-6 shows where on Kickstarter you begin the setup 
for Amazon Payments.
	
	 Next you verify your identity. This allows Kickstarter to be 
sure that you are who you say you are. 
	
3.	Click Identity Verification and begin entering the details 
requested regarding your address, Social Security 
Number, and driver’s license number.
	
	 The final step in setting up your Account tab is entering 
your contact details. This is how Kickstarter will contact 
you with backer updates, questions, or follow-up needs.
	
4.	Enter your e-mail address and phone number in the 
boxes where indicated.
	
	 Be sure that your spam filters are not set too high on what­
ever e-mail account you use for Kickstarter; otherwise they

your e-mail spam settings to allow any e-mails from the 
domain kickstarter.com.

Preparing for Kickstarter Review
After all the elements of your campaign have been uploaded into 
your project page through the Kickstarter dashboard, it’s time to 
submit your project to Kickstarter for review and approval.
It’s important to note that not every campaign is approved; some 
are rejected and need to be modified if they violate the terms, con­
ditions, or other regulations specified by Kickstarter. To ensure 
that your project is approved quickly, the next section reviews the 
final steps and checks that you should take before submission.
Double-checking your 
campaign uploads
Before you move to the Kickstarter Review tab, be sure to check 
the following:
	
✓	Take a moment to look at the seven tabs: Are any of them red 
or do they indicate an X? If so, click that tab and look to see 
what missing elements Kickstarter is asking for. Correct any 
errors.
	
✓	Click the Story tab and make sure that your video has loaded 
properly: You should see a small thumbnail image from your 
video. If necessary, re-upload your video until this tab is 
green.
	
✓	Click the About You tab and double-check your Biography to 
make sure that your profile photo is uploaded. (Adding a per­
sonal photo makes backers feel more connected to you and 
your project, even if they don’t know you personally.)
	
✓	If you have a Facebook account, be sure to use the box on this 
page called Facebook Connect, where you can post updates 
from your project to your Facebook page and also let people 
find your Kickstarter campaign through your Facebook page.
Conducting a final review and 
submitting your campaign
The last tab in the sequence is Review. Click this tab to double-
check the list of needs from Kickstarter; look for any elements 

 Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Campaign 97
flagged as red or with an X. The following steps walk you through 
this tab:
	
1.	Double-check your funding duration and funding goal 
one last time. 
	
	Once your project is accepted, your funding duration and 
funding goal cannot be changed. You will be able to edit 
some details of the project and add more photos — even 
after it has launched — but you won’t be able to change 
your goal or duration.
	
2.	Click Preview Project to see what your Kickstarter cam­
paign page will look like. 
	
3.	If you’re happy with everything on your dashboard and 
how your preview looks, click Submit for Review.
	
	 That’s it! Your project will now be reviewed by Kickstarter 
and will show up as Pending Review when you log in to 
your account — until you receive an e-mail indicating that 
the project has been accepted and you’re ready to launch. 
Your project will not be live until it is accepted and you 
launch it.

fter successfully submitting your project for approval, you 
should receive notification of acceptance within 48 hours. 
Congratulations! You’re ready to launch your project and watch 
the backers’ support come in — hopefully!
In this chapter I discuss how to officially launch your campaign 
and start contacting your potential backers. You also find out 
how to monitor your backers and provide updates throughout 
the project.
Launching Your Campaign
After you receive approval for your campaign from Kickstarter, 
your project campaign doesn’t automatically go live. You have to 
launch it. Figure 6-1 shows your project page once you’re cleared 
to launch and go live. (Note the Accepted status that appears in 
the sidebar on the right.)

Kickstarter For Dummies 
100
Figure 6-1: Kickstarter project page with status changed to Accepted.
Before you launch your project, you have a chance to review it 
before your campaign is live and available to potential backers. 
You can check out the review list in Chapter 5 for general project 
items to review. Most importantly, this is the last chance to adjust 
your funding duration and fine-tune the dates for your Kickstarter 
fundraising window.
	
Your Kickstarter campaign is not live when you get the e-mail mes­
sage saying your project has been accepted. The e-mail simply 
means your project is approved to be launched.
Here are some questions to consider before you officially start the 
clock on your campaign by launching it:
	
✓	Are you attempting to have your campaign end on a certain 
milestone date? If so, look at your duration and count out the 
number of days to identify your desired ending date and time. 
Make sure your duration and launch date set you up to meet 
that milestone end date.
	
✓	Do you need to avoid overlapping with holidays? As your 
fundraising campaign comes to a close, you’ll want to promote 
your deadline to backers and potential backers. (I explain 
promoting your deadline later in this chapter.) You’ll have 
trouble capturing people’s attention during this time if your 

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 101
campaign ends close to Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many 
people are busy preparing for their holiday celebrations, or if 
your campaign ends around national holidays, like Memorial 
Day or the Fourth of July in the U.S., when people often take 
time off to unplug and be with their friends and families. 
	
	If you see that your ending date and any substantial part of 
your fundraising time overlaps with an important holiday, 
consider adjusting the start date of your campaign to avoid 
the potential conflict unless your campaign specifically is 
related to a major holiday where people might naturally be 
searching for things around that topic.
	
✓	Are you timing your event to coincide with a major industry 
event or festival? This could be a worthwhile option if you 
think there would be a large potential audience for your proj­
ect and you’re planning on attending that event or industry 
gathering. For example, if you’re using Kickstarter to fund a 
cool new app in the Technology category, and you’re attending 
the SXSW conference in Austin, you might want to make sure 
your campaign is live during that timeframe and at least a 
week after, so that you can alert anyone you meet to the 
opportunity to back your project. On the flip side, if you’re 
not attending or participating in a big industry event, it might 
be wise to avoid your campaign being live during those dates, 
because everyone else might be busy with the event. For 
example, if you’re publishing a small comic book series and 
you’re not attending Comic-Con in San Diego, you could face 
difficulty getting attention of bloggers, writers, and industry 
leaders during those dates, because they will be covering the 
industry’s largest annual event.
Determine what date you want your project to go live based on 
your funding duration. If the ending date looks acceptable, you can 
launch that same day. If not, consider waiting so the end date coin­
cides with a milestone date you have in mind.
	
After your project is approved, you cannot change the funding 
duration. However, just because you receive notification that your 
project is approved, you do not have to launch it that day; you can 
wait.
You will receive an e-mail from Kickstarter that alerts you to the 
fact that you’re ready to launch. To actually launch your campaign, 
click the link sent in your acceptance e-mail message which will 
take you to your project dashboard. There, you will see a new 
green Launch button. Click it to proceed. When your campaign is 
live, you’re ready to start spreading the word.

Creating a Compelling 
Call to Action
When you make the ask for backers’ support, part of your ask 
needs to include a reason why the project should be completed. 
Beyond just your desire to make a funny cartoon or entertaining 
short film, there should be a reasoning behind your project.
Before you begin reaching out to backers, use the following pro­
cess to create your compelling call to action:
	
1.	Write down your responses to the following three 
questions:
 
• Why are you interested in your topic?
 
• What are you hoping to accomplish or achieve?
 
• Who would most benefit from your project?
	
2.	Examine the answers, and combine all three concepts into 
a single paragraph or even one sentence (if possible!). 
	
	 This is your compelling call to action. 
	
	 Your call to action should be at the very core of your 
request to potential backers. In the case of my Kickstarter 
project, I wanted backers to think about the concepts pre­
sented in The Finding 40 Project and encourage them to 
browse the stories and photos of women worldwide, all 
facing 40. The call was, “Is age just a number? Hear their 
stories and find your 40!” 
Contacting Potential Backers
After you have created an initial list of all your potential backers 
(Chapter 3 helps you get started), you need to figure out a way to 
get in touch with all of them. Obviously, you will likely talk one-on-
one about your project to your most personal contacts, such as 
family or close friends. These people care most about what your 
project means to you and your hopes for their level of support.
However, there will be a large list of people that need different 
ways of contact. In the sections that follow, you find tips for pro­
moting your Kickstarter campaign through several vehicles.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 103
Sending personal e-mails
E-mail is the most direct way to communicate with individuals on a 
one-on-one basis. In order to use this technique, you need several 
things:
	
✓	Each person’s individual e-mail address.
	
	Ensure that these people will recognize an e-mail from you on 
name alone — meaning that they know you as a person and 
not just an e-mail list administrator. For example, if you’re 
publishing a photo book on rescue animals for a volunteer 
group related to animal welfare, and you want to e-mail mem­
bers of the group, make sure that the people you’re e-mailing 
know of you as an individual and not just as a generic e-mail 
address such as info@animalgroup.com.
	
✓	A concise and direct call to action announcing the program 
and your request for backing.
The following example e-mail, based on my own Kickstarter cam­
paign, illustrates how you can clearly outline your project, dead­
lines, and goals:

Subject: Preorder your copy of The Finding 40 Project through 
my Kickstarter campaign
Hello!
I am very excited to announce that my Kickstarter campaign 
for the production of The Finding 40 Project is now up and live! 
This has been an amazing two year process, where I have been 
compiling a set of interviews and photos of women all around 
the world, all turning 40 years old. This book is the culmination 
of those efforts.
You can visit the campaign page here: http://www.
kickstarter.com/projects/920030067/finding-
40-project
Through the site, you can back the project and preorder an 
e-book or printed edition (or both) of the finished product 
based on your backer level. You can order only through 
October 31, so order now!
This has been an amazing process, and I’m excited to be clos­
ing in on the end, finishing up my last interviews at the end of 
the year and aiming for books to ship in Spring 2013.

Posting on Facebook
If you’re raising funds on Kickstarter, you most likely are a member 
of Facebook. (If you’re not very familiar with Facebook, check out 
the nearby sidebar.) Most Facebook members are aware of the 
ways people use Facebook to share day-to-day news and pictures 
of their family, friends, and pets. But Facebook is equally useful for 
sharing news and updates about your projects, and that includes 
promoting your Kickstarter campaign. The trick is, how can you 
keep your Facebook friends informed without wearing them out 
with fundraising requests? 
Many of the people on your potential backer list might already be 
your Facebook friends. A post on your personal wall is a good way 
to share information about your Kickstarter campaign in a quick 
and efficient manner.
When posting on your personal Facebook page, remember that 
most of the people reading your News Feed are friends and family, 
likely excited to help you succeed in your project. It’s okay here 
to add a bit more personal information about why your campaign 
is important to you. But, similar to the person who posts every 
single hour about the cute things their kid, dog, or spouse does, 
you don’t want to overdo it. To start, I recommend posting an 
announcement for the launch of your campaign.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 105
Figures 6-2 and 6-3 show examples of two different Facebook posts 
announcing a Kickstarter campaign.
Figure 6-2: Sample Facebook post introducing a Kickstarter campaign.
Getting started on Facebook and Twitter
Facebook and Twitter are social networking websites. On Facebook, you can 
choose whose status updates you’d like the follow, and in Facebook jargon, choos­
ing to follow someone’s updates is called “adding a friend.” Your Facebook friends 
also see your status updates. Depending on your Facebook privacy settings, only 
your friends or friends of friends can see your status updates. Facebook does offer 
the option to make all or some of your posts public, too. To get started on Facebook, 
visit www.facebook.com and follow the prompts to set up an account. Check 
out Facebook For Dummies or search for Facebook tips at www.dummies.com 
if you need more help getting started.
Twitter is different from Facebook in two ways: posts (or tweets, as they’re often 
called) are typically public and they’re limited to 140 characters. By public, I mean 
that people can see your tweets whether or not they’ve joined Twitter and elected 
to follow you. Anyone following you on Twitter sees your posts in his or her feed. 
However, anyone you choose to follow on Twitter doesn’t see your tweets unless 
he or she chooses to follow you back. You can set up an account and start explor­
ing how Twitter works at www.twitter.com. If you need more help wrapping 
your mind around the way Twitter works, check out Twitter For Dummies or simply 
check out the Twitter articles at www.dummies.com.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
106
Figure 6-3: A second example of how to announce your Kickstarter project.
After launching the campaign via your Facebook page, it’s impor­
tant to do regular updates that relate to both your requests for 
support and your generic project updates. One option is to post 
photos individually from your Kickstarter campaign with a link 
back to your Kickstarter page. Take a photo you might have used 
in your long description (embedded using the media tool on your 
page), post the photo on your Facebook page, and write a short 
description about what that photo represents. Is it an example 
of your project in action or something you hope to accomplish? 
A quick blurb with a link to the Kickstarter page is a way to keep 
your project top-of-mind for your Facebook network without 
having to ask directly every single time.
It’s important to remember that your Kickstarter campaign is only 
a small part of your overall Facebook community; you likely have 
many friends, colleagues and family members in your network. You 
talk with these people about countless things throughout the day, 
so make sure you don’t turn your Facebook wall into a never-end­
ing sea of posts about your campaign; intersperse your campaign 
updates with your typical status updates about other topics.
	
Facebook is a good way to alert people about the countdown to 
the end of your campaign. Remember to think about the dates on 
which you might want to post a “few days left” reminder — and 
work backward from there if you’re doing posts every three or 
four days.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 107
Using a Facebook business page
Beyond having a personal Facebook profile, you also have the 
option of creating a business page that can be used to promote 
your project. Similar to a personal page, you, as the administrator, 
can post updates, photos, links, videos, and more.
This type of page is very different from your personal Facebook 
profile. Unlike a personal profile, people “like” your page instead of 
becoming your friend. This way, users elect to see all the informa­
tion you post on your page in their News Feeds, but you cannot see 
their personal information.
You can begin the process of starting a Facebook page specifically 
for your project (if you haven’t done so already), by clicking the 
www.facebook.com/pages/create.php link. From there, you 
can choose from a list of types of pages:
	
✓	Local Business
	
✓	Company, Organization, or Institution
	
✓	Brand or Product
	
✓	Artist, Band, or Public Figure
	
✓	Entertainment
	
✓	Cause or Community
Based on the nature of your project, select the appropriate cat­
egory and begin developing your page. You can review Facebook 
Marketing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by John Haydon, Paul Dunay, 
and Richard Krueger for additional information on how to build, 
design, and market your page. A project-specific Facebook page 
is an excellent additional resource for promoting your Kickstarter 
campaign.
	
Begin building your Facebook page before starting your Kickstarter 
campaign to give you another opportunity for promotion from the 
day you launch. I started the Facebook page for The Finding 40 
Project about six months before I launched my Kickstarter cam­
paign and placed it in the Company, Organization, or Institution 
category under Websites and Blogs.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
108
Kickstarter has done an excellent job of integrating well with 
Facebook, realizing that this social media site is a very powerful 
tool for encouraging crowdfunding. Throughout the Kickstarter 
site, you can find ways to link your campaign with Facebook:
	
✓	On your main campaign home page, a button on the far right 
provides a link to your personal Facebook profile.
	
✓	Kickstarter has its own business page at www.facebook.
com/Kickstarter where you can keep updated on the 
latest projects and modifications to the Kickstarter page. Click 
the Like button to add this page to your Facebook News Feed.
	
✓	If you end up creating a business page for your project, you 
can link to that page in your long description by adding the 
full website address in the copy and clicking the Link button 
in the editing box; then users can visit your Facebook busi­
ness page and potentially “like” it.
Tweeting about your campaign
Although Twitter gives you only 140 characters, you should be 
able to compel your followers to at least click through to your 
Kickstarter campaign link to learn more about your project.
	
Twitter differs from Facebook in one key area: Someone does not 
have to be your “friend” or “like” your page to see your Twitter 
post. Once you’ve posted something to Twitter, it’s available for 
all to search. This can be a great advantage: People who may not 
be looking for you on Facebook can find your project. But remem­
ber to publish only content that you’d want everyone on the 
Internet to see.
	
Here are a few tips for creating a Twitter post, or tweet: 
	
✓	Keep the content relevant to your campaign.
	
✓	Use some or part of your Call to Action. 
	
✓	Include a short URL that directs people to your Kickstarter 
campaign, as shown in Figures 6-4 and 6-5. A short URL is a 
shortened website address. Using a short URL enables you 
to include a link your tweet without using up your entire 
140-character allotment.

different ways to announce a Kickstarter launch on Twitter.

Posting your campaign video 
on video-sharing sites
You’ve already created a strong project video, so here’s another 
way to use it to your advantage. Since the project video is designed 
to explain your project in a nutshell, use it to tell your story on 
other video-sharing sites.
Take the short blurb you already wrote as part of your campaign 
application and use it as a caption, video title, or description when 
you upload your video to YouTube and similar video-sharing sites. 
When you upload a video to a sharing site, you can usually include 
some information about the video and set a few options. Be sure to 
follow these tips: 
	
✓	Make your video public. You want your video to turn up in 
search results, and you want viewers to have the ability to 
share the video with their friends. 
	
✓	Add search tags that are associated with the keywords in 
your description. Examples include film, photography, and so 
on. Make sure one of these is a keyword relating to the topic 
of your project.
	
✓	Include your name. You want to make sure to develop recog­
nition as the project creator and enable people to find your 
project via your name if they know you or know of you.
	
✓	Insert your Kickstarter campaign URL as a clickable link. For 
the link to work, you typically need to paste in the full web 
address with the http:// in front.
Using your short blurb, keywords, and Kickstarter URL allows 
users to find you if they search for any of those topics.
Below is a list of some video-sharing sites to consider when posting 
your project video:
	
✓	YouTube.com
	
✓	Vimeo.com
	
✓	GoogleVideo.com
	
✓	DailyMotion.com
	
✓	Break.com (This one’s appropriate if your video is humorous.)
	
✓	FunnyOrDie.com (Again, use this one if your video is humorous.)

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 111
Each of the preceding sites has its own requirements for file size, 
format, upload protocols, and guidelines. Take some time to 
browse the videos posted on each of these and review the steps 
required for uploading your Kickstarter campaign video.
Tracking Your Backers
One of Kickstarter’s best features is the ability to quickly review 
how many backers you have, how much money they’ve pledged, 
and what reward each has selected. As your project continues, be 
sure to log in to your Kickstarter account every day and view your 
current Backer Report and status.
After you launch your project, you can follow these steps to look at 
your Backer Report at any time:
	
1.	Go to the main Kickstarter web page and click the Me 
icon at the top — it should also have your profile picture. 
Or if you’re not logged in, then log in first.
	
2.	Click your launched project name. 
	
	 Your project page appears, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 6-6. Here you see how many backers you have, how 
much money you’ve raised, and how much time is left to 
reach your fundraising goal.
Figure 6-6: A Kickstarter project page looks like this after the project is launched.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
112
	
	 At the top of the screen, you see several options — including 
Edit Project, Dashboard, Backer Report, and Post Update.
	
3.	Click Backer Report to view your project’s backers, as 
shown in Figure 6-7.
	
	 At this screen you see a list of the number of backers in 
each reward category per the guidelines you set up on your 
project. 
	
4.	To see actual individual backers, click the View Report 
arrow to the right of each backer level.
	
	 Figure 6-8 shows a sample Backer Report at the $25 level 
for a project; notice the individual backers listed, date, and 
status for each one.
In February 2013, Kickstarter launched an iPhone App available 
through the App Store. If you have an iPhone, this is a great tool 
for tracking your backers while you’re on the go, as I explain in 
Chapter 7. If you have a different kind of smartphone, you can 
probably find a similar app for your mobile operating system. As 
this book went to press, the only Kickstarter-sponsored app is the 
iPhone app.
Figure 6-7: The main Backer Report page.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 113
Figure 6-8: The Backer Report for a specific reward level.
Contacting Your Backers 
through Kickstarter
When you have a Kickstarter campaign, you can use a few different 
tools on the website to contact your backers. Your options include
	
✓	Messaging individual backers.
	
✓	Messaging all backers who chose a certain reward.
	
✓	Posting an update to all your backers.
	
✓	Posting an update to backers that’s also visible to anyone who 
visits your campaign page.
In the following sections, I show you where to find the messaging 
tools for these options and explain how the tools work.
Sending a message
If you follow the steps in the preceding section to access the 
Backer Report page for a reward level, you also find two ways to 
contact your backers (refer to Figure 6-8):

Kickstarter For Dummies 
114
	
✓	Message an individual backer: To the right of each backer’s 
name, you see a mail icon called Send Message. This allows 
you to send individual notes to backers on a one-on-one basis.
	
✓	Message backers in a reward tier: At the top of the report for 
a reward level is a Message All link. Click this link to message 
all backers who share a particular reward tier. While your 
campaign is active, this tool can be especially helpful if you 
want to offer perks to backers in a certain tier if they pledge a 
little more to your campaign. (Chapter 3 explains the concept 
of adding perks to a reward.)
In addition to messages, the Backer Report page gives you a few 
other tools to communicate with backers, but those aren’t avail­
able when you’re still raising funds. While your campaign is active, 
you see grayed-out buttons for things like Generate Your Report or 
Create a Survey, as shown in Figure 6-9. Don’t worry about those 
items now. These are tools Kickstarter has embedded into the 
website to allow you to communicate with backers to gather (say) 
e-mail and mailing addresses for delivery of finished products once 
your project is complete. Chapter 8 discusses completing your 
project and communicating with backers in greater depth.
Figure 6-9: Non-active buttons in Backer Report.
Posting updates
Kickstarter has an excellent built-in function that allows you to 
communicate in bulk to everyone who has already backed your 

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 115
project. You can even use this tool to post generic updates to your 
project, viewable to everyone, not just to backers. When you post 
an update, your message and any media that you add appears at 
the top of your campaign’s main page, just above where your video 
appears. There, people can click Updates and see every public 
update you’ve posted to date.
	
Project updates are a terrific way to 
	
✓	Count down the number of days left. (See “Promoting Your 
Deadline” later in this chapter for more about this topic.) 
	
✓	Update backers on milestones reached.
	
✓	Answer questions from backers.
	
✓	Share photos, videos, or audio relating to your project in 
action.
To post an update, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the top of your project page, click the Post Update tab.
	
2.	In the Title area, add a title for your update. 
	
	 The title should be short and action-driven, leading 
with terms that highlight something new or different 
is happening — such as “Only 3 days left to back the 
project,” or “We’ve just completed the proofing on our 
book.” These titles should show action, just like a news­
paper heading.
	
3.	In the Body area, enter the text you’d like to appear in 
your update; use the formatting tools to add bold, italics, 
links, lists, and so on. 
	
	 The text should also be fairly concise and get quickly to the 
point about what the update is for. People can read your 
campaign page for an overview of your project. The update 
should tell them something that’s not already on your page.
	
4.	At the bottom of your Project Update screen, click any of 
the three Media Upload icons to upload video, audio, or 
photo files from your computer.
	
5.	At the bottom of the Project Update screen, below the 
Media Upload icons, select who can see your update: 
Backers Only or Anyone.
	
	 Make your update public for all to see or just for your back­
ers. Figure 6-10 shows where you select whether an update 
is public or private.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
116
	
	 If your update has sensitive or financial information you 
only want your committed backers to see, select Backers 
Only. If you’re publishing a more general update and want 
it viewable by anyone who comes to your Kickstarter page, 
select Anyone.
	
6.	Proofread the text of your message to make sure the 
information is accurate and that you haven’t made any 
spelling or grammar mistakes. 
	
	
You can’t go back and change an update after you post it, 
so take your time beforehand, making sure the content of 
your update is correct.
	
7.	Click the blue Preview Update button at the bottom of the 
page to see what your post will look like; check it once 
again for errors.
	
8.	When you’ve reviewed the Preview, click either Publish 
or Edit from the two buttons at the top of the screen on 
the right. 
 
• If you need to make changes, click Edit and repeat the 
editing process. 
 
• If you’re happy with the update, click Publish to make

The Kickstarter iPhone app enables you to post updates from the 
field. It’s a great way to post a picture from a video shoot and have 
it appear in real time, for example. See Chapter 7 for details.
Promoting Your Deadline
All Kickstarter campaigns have a definite end date; if you don’t hit 
your fundraising goal, you don’t get any of the money pledged by 
your backers. Accordingly, it’s important to alert both your backers 
and potential backers about the number of days left for two main 
reasons:
	
✓	Your existing backers may have other friends who would be 
interested in supporting your project.
	
✓	Potential backers who received your initial campaign launch 
communication may have forgotten or may not realize the 
number of days left in your campaign.
To promote your deadline to your existing backers, you can use 
project updates, as I explain in the preceding section. Figure 6-11 
shows a project update I posted for my Kickstarter campaign just 
two days before it ended. Note that the title highlights the number 
of days left and amount of money I still needed to raise in order to 
meet my goal. In the body of my message, I outlined three specific 
ways backers could help me reach my goal:
	
✓	Share my project with people they know.
	
✓	Increase their pledge and reward.
	
✓	Preorder additional copies of my book.
To promote your deadline to potential backers, you can use all the 
same tools I cover for announcing your campaign. (See the earlier 
section, “Contacting Potential Backers,” for details.) Your goal is to 
encourage backers to come on board before your campaign ends.
Figure 6-12 shows a revised version of a Facebook post highlighting 
the number of days left in a Kickstarter campaign for the game, 
Spaghetti & Meatballs. The campaign owner has used his personal 
Facebook page to let people know his campaign has 17 days left. 
Note how he also outlines the level of support he needs in order 
to meet his goal. What’s great about this post is it shows how very 
attainable the goal is if many people participate on a small level, 
highlighting the power of crowdfunding.

Kickstarter campaign.
Figure 6-12: This Facebook post highlights the number of days left for 
the Spaghetti & Meatballs Kickstarter campaign.
You may also have used personal e-mails to introduce your 
Kickstarter project to family, friends, co-workers, and other con­
tacts. When you have three weeks, two weeks, and one week left, 
it’s a good idea to send a reminder e-mail with the countdown 
highly emphasized in both the subject line of the message — and 
visible high up in the content, as shown in Figure 6-13.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 119
Figure 6-13: Updated e-mail showing urgency in subject line and content.
Each day, you can log in to your Kickstarter project and see the 
number of days left to go, your total backers, and the percentage 
of your total goal received.
	
Kickstarter is all or nothing! If you find yourself with a week to go 
and a large percentage left to raise, think about contacting new 
organizations or groups for potential backers and alerting them to 
your impending deadline.
Paying to Promote Your Campaign
You have an overall project budget (as developed in Chapter 3). Don’t 
forget to track costs you might spend promoting your Kickstarter 
campaign against that budget.
For example, you might consider any of the following paid services 
to promote your campaign and deadline:
	
✓	Buying a Facebook advertisement
	
✓	Electing to promote your post on Facebook
	
✓	Buying an Internet advertisement on an industry website

Kickstarter For Dummies 
120
	
✓	Taking out an advertisement in a local newspaper to promote 
your deadline
	
✓	Hosting events or dinners to educate potential backers about 
your project 
All of these are legitimate ways to promote your deadline — but 
remember: They all cost money. Be sure to enter these costs into 
your project spreadsheet (outlined in Chapter 3) so you can track 
what was spent on the overall project.
Buying advertising on Facebook
Facebook ads are a way to reach a large number of Facebook users 
around the world without needing to draw them to your business 
page or becoming your friend. Facebook ads appear on the right 
side of a user’s Facebook News Feed every time they log in. There 
are two main types of advertisements: 
	
✓	Display ads include a photo and text much like an ad in a 
newspaper or magazine. 
	
✓	Sponsored story ads appear onscreen like posts on a wall.
One of the best things about potentially advertising your 
Kickstarter campaign on Facebook is that you can advertise by 
location, interests, or connections — and you can target just the 
people who’ve already “liked” your page. To support a Kickstarter 
campaign, you can pick only people in your geographic area if 
you’re promoting a regional event or performance, or everyone 
interested in a certain topic (such as books, magazines, or product 
design). Figure 6-14 shows how the targeting works.
The cost to advertise on Facebook varies greatly based on the 
demand for access to a certain audience, meaning the more a 
group or geographic area is desired, the higher the advertising 
rate. Facebook uses a bidding system, where you can set a number 
that you’re willing to pay per click (meaning you pay only when 
someone actually clicks your ad) or per impression (payment 
based on a total of how many people viewed your advertisement). 
Facebook uses a closed bidding system, meaning you do not get to 
see what others pay for their ads.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 121
Figure 6-14: Facebook’s advertising targeting options.
There is no hard-and-fast way to determine how much a Facebook 
ad will cost; it could be as low as $100 and as high as $1,000 and 
up. If you decide to pay for a Facebook advertisement, be sure to 
put that expense into your master budget as a cost — and look at 
the number of backers you would have to have (and at what level) 
to make the benefit to the project worth the cost. When you set 
up your Facebook advertisement, you determine the budget per 
day or per lifetime of the ad — meaning that if you reach the target 
number of clicks or impressions by the end of a certain day, the 
ad will not run again until the next day, ensuring that you don’t go 
over the budget you’ve set in your account.
You can learn more about Facebook advertising at www.facebook.
com/advertising. This information is correct as this book went to 
press, but Facebook is constantly changing these tools. For example, 
just a few months earlier, the promoted post option was not avail­
able, and now it is a popular advertising tool on Facebook. Check 
Facebook’s advertising web page for the most current information.
Purchasing other Internet 
or newspaper ads
Another opportunity for promoting your Kickstarter campaign is a 
website banner or newspaper ad. This is usually a larger expense 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
122
than Facebook ads; you may or may not have control over how 
many people view your actual advertisement, but it could be a 
good source of potential backers.
It’s likely that you already know the websites and newspapers/
magazines that cover your industry or neighborhood. In order to 
get a sense for what an advertisement in these outlets might cost, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	If you’re on a website, look to see if it has an Advertise or 
Contact Us tab or button.
	
2.	If a Media Kit is available, download it. 
	
	 This kit will have the organization’s current reach, audience 
figures, and advertising rates (as shown in Figure 6-15).
	
3.	If you don’t see the Media Kit easily available, try the 
Search function on the website.
	
4.	If you still don’t see the Media Kit, use a Contact button 
or phone number to request a current Media Kit.
Figure 6-15: Sample of Media Kit contents.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 123
	
5.	Review the content provided in the Media Kit. 
	
	 You find options for various sizes and types of advertise­
ments, as well as the minimum run commitments.
	
6.	Based on the run dates and other specifics of your cam­
paign, request a quote from the ad representative — and 
then negotiate!
	
	 Ad rates are always negotiable; it never hurts to ask for a 
discount.
	
If you choose to buy an advertisement to promote your Kickstarter 
campaign, take the timeframe for your campaign into account — 
and how many times your message will be seen during that 30 or 
60 days. Also remember that publications such as magazines and 
weekly newspapers have a long lead time — the advertising is sold 
days or weeks in advance. Plan accordingly.
Using promotional events and ideas 
to drive backers to your campaign 
Promotional events are another idea for spreading the word on 
your Kickstarter campaign. A hosted happy hour is one familiar 
way to reach out to a group, potentially targeting people you 
wouldn’t reach otherwise. Here are a few ideas for promotional 
events:
	
✓	Artists’ nights: Look at the restaurants and bars around your 
home. Do you ever see them hosting artists or displays? Do 
they have a regular night of the month where local filmmak­
ers come in and show their movies as entertainment for the 
audience?
	
	Many local establishments are looking for ways to enhance 
guests’ entertainment without spending additional money. 
You, as a creative person, might have something to share or 
add to an establishment’s ambiance.
	
	Figure 6-16 shows a web page for a restaurant called Basic 
Pizza which hosts local artists on Tuesday evenings. If you’re 
using Kickstarter to create a gallery showing or photo exhibi­
tion, this might be a great opportunity to get your work in 
front of a new audience.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
124
Figure 6-16: Artists’ night at Basic Pizza in San Diego.
	
	Spend some time examining opportunities right nearby to 
participate in an evening like this; you may also want to speak 
to a manager about potentially hosting your own evening — 
where you are the only artist present — in exchange for a 
small fee. Again, such a fee is a hard cost, so be sure to add it 
to your project budget.
	
✓	Raffle events: This can be an online event tied to your 
Kickstarter campaign, potentially run via your Facebook or 
Twitter posts. Post an announcement that everyone who 
backs your project within the next 24 or 48 hours will be 
entered into a raffle that will bump them up to the next backer 
level without an increase in pledge (for example, if you pledge 
$25 in the designated timeframe, you will get the rewards of a 
$50 backer for $25).
	
✓	Pledge upgrade promotions: This is an idea for getting your 
existing backers to up their pledge level. Send a message to 
everyone that has pledged to a certain level and tell them for 
a designated time only (24–48 hours), if they increase their 
pledge to the next level, they will get a premium reward not 
currently available on the site.

iPhone Elevation Dock: 
Getting the Word Out
Apple fans are often obsessive about getting the latest and best 
technology — and are picky about what they choose to use with 
their Apple products. The team at ElevationLab knew this and spe­
cifically marketed the Elevation Dock (which I introduce in Chapter 
2) as a product worthy of association with the consumer’s iPhone.
ElevationLab even crafted its website and images to mimic the look 
and feel of the main Apple website, as shown in Figure 6-17.
	
If your Kickstarter campaign is likely to be popular with users of an 
existing product or service, think of that audience as a potential 
pool of backers — even if you’re not already in touch with them.
So the Elevation Dock was “The Best Dock for your iPhone,” 
according to its campaign creators. How would they let other 
people know? 
A first step was to promote the project within the company’s exist­
ing client base and friends and families.
Getting Picky: Project of the Day
When someone first comes to the Kickstarter home page, regardless of location, he 
or she sees a Project of the Day link to a current project’s campaign. If your cam­
paign becomes a Project of the Day, it’s a great promotional tool, but unfortunately, 
you don’t have much control over this placement.
There is no specific way to submit your project for consideration as a Project of 
the Day, but the best ways to make your project stand out include the following:
	✓	Create a compelling reason why your project needs to happen.
	✓	Use an attention-grabbing video that draws people in.
	✓	Upload other media, such as photos and audio, that help tell your story and 
potentially engage the Kickstarter staff to learn more.
I explain the basics of creating compelling content for your campaign in Chapter 2.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
126
Figure 6-17: ElevationLab home page.
To become truly successful and a runaway hit, they needed to 
reach the Apple fan base — the enthusiastic mass audience that 
might not even be aware that Kickstarter existed, let alone a prod­
uct that filled a very real niche.
ElevationLab began blogging, tweeting, and posting on Facebook 
about the dock and the Kickstarter campaign; bloggers and writers 
who covered new technology — and Apple in particular — were 
targeted and sent links to the Kickstarter campaign.
Websites such as TheNextWeb and Gizmodo first picked up and 
ran with the story that the Elevation Dock was truly better than 
the Apple-produced product. Once those first hits began to come 
in, interest in the product began to snowball as stories got tweeted 
and shared around the tech blogosphere.
Why did the Elevation Dock campaign work so well?
	
✓	The team included designers trying to create a product that 
really met a market niche, based on their own personal 
experience.
	
✓	The team knew its audience — Apple users — would pay a 
premium for a better-designed product.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 127
	
✓	The campaign was focused and targeted on a single product 
with a strong user base.
	
✓	Using the team’s own community (tech bloggers) helped to 
create a buzz.
Finding 40: Learning from My 
Own Kickstarter Campaign(s)
One of the best ways to become an expert at something is to try, 
fail, figure out what you did wrong, and try again. Here’s where I 
share my experiences as a Kickstarter user with both a successful 
and an unsuccessful campaign under my belt. I share my lessons 
learned about creating compelling content, specifying what the 
funds are for, and promoting my campaign. When I applied these 
lessons to my second campaign, I was not only successful, but also 
doubled my fundraising target.
	
You can benefit from my experiences whether you want to review 
key elements of a successful campaign before you officially launch 
your project or you’re trying to figure out the next steps after an 
unsuccessful campaign.
Looking at my project
I first became aware of Kickstarter in early 2012 after a friend had 
used it to fund an art showing. After poking around a bit on the 
site, I determined this would be a great way to get funding for my 
book, The Finding 40 Project (www.finding40.net). 
Since May 2011, I’d been photographing and interviewing women 
facing the “big 4-0,” around the country and internationally. My 
goal was to create a book of their stories and photos, highlighting 
what age 40 means, and showing how different it could look.
I thought Kickstarter would be a great way to finish the funding of 
the project and move me toward a book deal. I needed capital to 
travel to locations to photograph women — and also to defray the 
production costs for a proposal.
I began filling out my Kickstarter campaign for The Finding 40 Project 
with details about me, my vision and ambition, and the concept for 
the book — without really thinking too specifically about my end goal.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
128
Filling the content
Figure 6-18 shows the initial home page for my first campaign.
Here you can see that I’m trying to describe the project and my 
vision, and to lay out an idea to have the Kickstarter campaign fund 
the next leg of the project. But I made three key mistakes here:
	
✓	The initial content was too vague and did not grab the reader’s 
attention.
	
✓	The description was too short.
	
✓	I wasn’t clear about what I was going to use the money for.
At the time, I thought everyone would be interested in funding my 
book and following the blog — I didn’t even think at all about why 
people should be interested.
Additionally, I failed to use the Project Description section to add 
any FAQs or other notes.
	
Kickstarter gives you many opportunities to talk about your project, 
add a Q&A section, and discuss Risks and Challenges, so use them! 
The more information you can share about the project, the more 
potential backers will feel confident about their pledge.
Figure 6-18: The campaign content for my first Kickstarter campaign.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 129
Another key mistake made in my first Kickstarter campaign: I didn’t 
use enough media. I did create and upload a project campaign 
video, but I didn’t add any other supporting photos of the project 
in action, or women photographed to date. The content page 
looked very bland, as shown in Figure 6-19.
In Chapter 2, I walk you through tips (and even a few exercises) to 
help you create good supporting content for your project.
Failing to use my own networks
You can’t just expect to put a project up on Kickstarter and expect 
people to find and back it out of the blue.
I made a classic mistake when I launched my first campaign: I 
didn’t tell anyone about it! Once the campaign went live, I did a 
single Facebook post and sent one e-mail out to friends and family. 
As you learn in this chapter, promoting your campaign takes much 
more than that!
	
Getting people to pledge to your Kickstarter campaign often 
involves multiple rounds of contact. You can’t just send out one 
blank message and expect people to all act at once!
Figure 6-19: Failing to add enough media creates a bland page.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
130
I also failed to use my larger professional and community net­
works. I did not reach out to my fellow photographer friends, nor 
do any PR or blogging.
Not strategizing properly
Here’s where the importance of two must-dos crops up: creating a 
compelling call to action and showing firm reasoning behind your 
campaign. Your call to action is essential to campaign success. In 
my first Kickstarter campaign, the call to action was far too vague; 
backers didn’t know what they were really funding.
Even though my fundraising goal was smaller in my first campaign 
versus my second ($2,000 versus $4,000), I fell far short because 
backers didn’t feel that they understood what the campaign was 
about.
Instead of using firm words like “printing, production, or design,” 
my first campaign talked about “funding the next leg of the project” 
and “hard costs,” without indicating what those costs were to be.
	
You’re asking backers to help make your project a reality, and they 
need to know exactly what — in real terms — their money is going 
toward.
Second campaign: Success!
In October 2012, I launched my second Kickstarter campaign for 
The Finding 40 Project. This time I knew more about what I needed 
funding for — and how to communicate with backers.
Figure 6-20 shows the revised campaign page, with a much more 
detailed description and call to action.
This time around, I beat my funding goal and secured $4,281 for 
production costs. Why did I succeed this time?
	
✓	The campaign description was much more specific.
	
✓	Backers got a very clear sense of what they were supporting.
	
✓	I showed more of the finished product/photos.
	
✓	I used media more effectively. 
	
✓	Backer rewards were tied to finished production elements 
with firm delivery dates.
	
✓	I specifically addressed “Why Kickstarter?” for backers — 
explaining how traditional publishing had changed.

 Chapter 6: Managing an Active Campaign 131
One of the most important lessons that I learned in the entire 
process was to think about what you’re trying to accomplish before 
you even launch your campaign. If you launch before you have 
a clear sense of what you need (as I did the first time around), 
you’re likely to fail. If you clarify your goals and do your homework 
beforehand to figure out what it takes to get there, you’ve got a 
shot.

e’re living in an on-the-go world. Mobile technology is 
everywhere, and devices like laptops, smartphones, and 
tablets are not only supplementing but, in some cases, replacing 
the home computer.
Kickstarter has entered the mobile game with its new Kickstarter 
app for iPhone.
This new app allows users to manage their account even faster 
than before. Through the app, campaign owners can:
	
✓	Find out about new pledges as they happen
	
✓	Stay better connected with their backer groups
	
✓	Send photo and video updates right from their iPhones
	
✓	Search and back countless other Kickstarter projects
	
The iPhone app is best used to manage, update, and monitor your 
campaign remotely. Using a laptop or desktop computer is still 
ideal for setting up a campaign (as I explain in Chapter 5), because 
these tools enable you to navigate the Kickstarter dashboard and 
upload media more easily than you can on the app.
As of publication, Kickstarter hasn’t sponsored an app for Android, 
but it might in the near future. If you’re an Android user, I recommend 
checking the Kickstarter site frequently for news and updates. You 
can also find third-party Kickstarter apps for Android phones. iPad 
users can use the Kickstarter iPhone app, too, or simply go to the 
Kickstarter website in the iPad’s Safari browser.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
134
Downloading the App
The first step is to download the free Kickstarter app to your 
iPhone. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	Launch the App Store icon and search for Kickstarter.
	
	 The app appears on your screen as available for download, 
as shown in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1: Kickstarter app available for 
download. 
	
2.	Tap the Free button and then tap the Install button, 
shown in Figure 7-2.
	
3.	If prompted, enter your AppleID and password to verify 
the download.
	
	 After the app has downloaded, you can tap the Open 
button in the App Store to open the app immediately. Also, 
the Kickstarter app icon appears on your Home screen.
	
	 Whenever you want to open the Kickstarter app, simply 
tap its icon on your Home screen, and the main screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.

Logging In and Out
To really use the app, you need to first log into your Kickstarter 
account. If you don’t want to stay signed in on your iPhone, you 
can log out when you’re done using the app. Here’s how it works:
	
✓	Log In: From the main app page, tap Log In in the lower right 
(refer to Figure 7-3). You then see your existing Kickstarter 
account, which will look very similar to the screen shown in 
Figure 7-4.
	
✓	Log Out: Tap the Profile icon or the Dashboard icon. From 
either screen, tap Settings and scroll to the bottom of the 
Settings screen, where you see a large Log Out button. Tap it 
and the app asks you to confirm that you want to log out.
Figure 7-4: Your main Kickstarter app page 
after you log in.
	
If you stay logged into the Kickstarter app and your phone is lost 
or stolen, the app could give anyone access to your Kickstarter 
account (as well as any other unsecured apps on your iPhone). 
You wouldn’t want to compromise your campaign by giving a 

 Chapter 7: Kickstarter for iPhone 137
stranger the ability to contact your backers as you. (Neither would 
you want the toddler in your life to contact all your backers acci­
dentally as he or she fiddles with your phone.) Do what you can to 
keep all the accounts connected to your phone secure and be sure 
to change all your passwords in the unfortunate event that your 
phone is lost or stolen. And remember that logging out of the app 
is a good preventive step to protect access to your campaign.
Touring the Kickstarter 
App Interface
When you first log in to the app, notice that the default option 
at the top of the app page is Staff Picks, meaning the staff-picked 
projects of the day will appear on the main page. Along the bottom 
are three additional icons: Discover, Activity, and Profile. If you’ve 
started setting up your campaign on the Kickstarter website (as I 
explain in Chapter 5), you also see a Dashboard icon. 
By default, the Discover icon is selected, meaning that you’re in 
the part of the app that’s designed for discovering Kickstarter proj­
ects. The following sections walk you through each area.
Discovering projects
The Discovery area of the app has several areas that enable you to 
explore Kickstarter projects, just as you’d find on the Kickstarter 
website. Tap the little green arrow at the top to access the follow­
ing items, which appear on the screen shown in Figure 7-5:
	
✓	Staff Picks: You can swipe through a list of staff project picks.
	
✓	Popular: Scroll through a list of popular projects in this area.
	
✓	Starred: If you find a project you like, you can give it a star 
by tapping the project and then tapping the star icon that 
appears at the lower left.
	
✓	Search: To search for a project by name, use this search tool. 
If you have a live Kickstarter campaign, check out how it looks 
in the app by searching for your campaign by name.
	
✓	Categories: Below the four tiles at the top, you see a list of 
Kickstarter project categories. Tap a category to browse proj­
ects within that category.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
138
Figure 7-5: A full list of Kickstarter categories.
Checking other projects’ activities
The Kickstarter app for iPhone also allows you to follow a friend 
or back a project. On the main page of the app, you will see a small 
icon that looks like a lightning bolt labeled Activity. This is sepa­
rate from the activity of your own Kickstarter campaign that you 
see in your dashboard.
Tap the Activity icon and you see a list — either of projects you’ve 
already backed or of friends’ projects you’ve starred to indicate 
that you’d like to follow the campaigns’ progress.
Tap the name of the project you’d like to look at and you can 
see the current funds raised towards the project’s goal, number 
of backers, and days left. If the campaign’s creator has posted 
updates, those are visible here as well.
	
If you’ve already backed a project, you will see all the available 
updates. If you have not backed a project and are simply following 
its progress, you will see only the updates the campaign owner has 
labeled as Visible to Everyone.

 Chapter 7: Kickstarter for iPhone 139
Peeking into your profile
When you tap the icon that says Profile, you will see options for 
both Messages and Settings.
The Messages function of your profile acts basically like a private 
e-mail box; these are not public like a Facebook or Twitter posting. 
You can send and receive messages to individual backers of your 
project or campaign owners of projects you’re interested in. This 
location is where you will also get messages from the owners of 
campaigns you’ve already backed.
These messages are different from the Updates you receive from 
a backer. If you’ve backed a campaign and the campaign’s owner 
posts an update for all backers to see, you’ll see it as an alert in 
your Activity page.
Under the Settings icon, you can select how you choose to be 
updated on various aspects of your Kickstarter account. You will 
see three different parts of your account: Projects You Back, Creator 
Notifications, and Social Notifications, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6: Selecting how you receive updates.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
140
Next to each category, you see an icon for an envelope and a 
mobile device. This allows you to decide whether you would like to 
be e-mailed about activity and have updates viewable in the mobile 
app.
The Social Notifications icon allows you to get an alert if one of 
your friends on Facebook has launched a Kickstarter project; you 
can then view the project and decide if you would like to back it.
Managing Your Campaign 
from the Kickstarter App
From this point, you can use the app to view and reply to mes­
sages, change your settings, see your account activity, and post 
updates to your ongoing Kickstarter project. The following sec­
tions explain how.
Viewing and replying to messages
When you tap your Dashboard icon, you will see an envelope-looking 
icon next to the word Messages. There will also be a number just 
to the right, showing how many unread messages you have. Here’s 
how you view and reply to your messages:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, tap Messages.
	
	 The app by default takes you to your inbox, where you 
can scroll through the previews of any incoming messages 
(much like a preview pane on your e-mail account). 
	
2.	To open a message, simply tap it once. 
	
	 The full message pops up onscreen.
	
3.	To reply to this message, tap the icon that looks like a 
backward-facing arrow in the top-right corner of your 
screen, as shown in Figure 7-7.
	
4.	Type the reply to your sender using the keypad; then, to 
send your message, tap the arrow at the top-right corner 
of the green box that looks like a paper airplane.
	
	 You are returned to the original message and you see the 
reply below it. 
	
5.	Tap the return-arrow icon at the top-left of the screen to 
get back to the main part of the Messages functionality.

 Chapter 7: Kickstarter for iPhone 141

The Dashboard provides a quick overview of everything going 
on with your account; you can use the Activity button on your 
Dashboard to see everything that has happened with your 
account — including your updates, new backer pledges, and 
pledge increases from backers — all in a chronological format. 
The very first item you see when you click Activity is the most 
recent thing that has happened with your account. This could be 
a project update you’ve done for your backers after a successful 
campaign, a project update for a campaign in progress, the most 
recent pledge you’ve received, and so on.

If you’re a Facebook user, it’s helpful to think of this section as 
working like the Facebook Timeline model: All the things that have 
happened in your campaign appear here, in chronological order 
from newest to oldest.
Posting project updates 
for your backers
	
The Kickstarter app is a powerful tool for posting updates about 
your project. For example, the app can be extremely helpful if you 
want to do a fast update from the field, such as during a film shoot 
or product test.
Here’s how to post an update with the Kickstarter app:
	
1.	Tap the icon to launch your Dashboard.
	
	 You see a large green button right in the middle of the 
screen that says Post Update.
	
2.	Tap Post Update to see the screen shown in Figure 7-8.
Figure 7-8: Posting an update directly from 
the Kickstarter app.

 Chapter 7: Kickstarter for iPhone 143
	
3.	Using the iPhone keypad, type a title for your update and 
then type the body of the message you want to send to 
backers. 
	
4.	To attach media (such as photos or videos), tap the 
Attachments button.
	
	 You see the screen shown in Figure 7-9. 
Figure 7-9: Choosing attachments from your 
media sources.
	
5.	Tap either option, depending on what you’d like to do:
 
• Tap Take a New Photo/Video if you want to take new 
photo or video in real time.
 
• Tap Choose from Camera Roll if you want to upload 
existing media from your camera roll.
	
6.	Choose whether to make the update public or for backers 
only.
	
	 The lower-left corner of this screen shows an open-lock 
icon that says Public. Leave this alone if you want every­
one to be able to see your update. If you want your update 
only viewable by backers, tap that icon: The icon switches 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
144
to a closed lock and says Backers Only. You can make the 
choice — if it’s an update that might be of interest 
to someone considering your project, make it public; if it’s 
something specific or private that you want to share only 
with people who have already committed to fund your 
campaign, change the icon to Backers Only.
	
7.	Tap the Preview green button on the top of this screen to 
get a look at how your update will appear onscreen. 
	
	 If something seems off or you notice a typo, click Edit on 
the top left and go back to correct the post and tap Preview 
again.
	
8.	When you’re satisfied with the update, tap the green 
Publish button at the top-right of the screen to make your 
update live on your Kickstarter page.

W

hen you’re coming to the end of your campaign, your proj­
ect may be just beginning. Whether or not your campaign 
was successful, you can follow up with your backers to ensure 
they have a positive experience with your project. In this chapter, 
you find out how the Kickstarter site helps you thank your backers 
and deliver their rewards. I also help you continue building a com­
munity and making the most of your progress so far.
Handling a Struggling or 
Unsuccessful Campaign
One of the great things about your Kickstarter page is that you’ll 
always know exactly the number of days, hours, and minutes left 
until your campaign ends. If you’ve already hit your target goal, 
this is an exciting time to watch other backers push you up and 
over the minimum you hoped to raise.
On the other hand, if you’re short of your goal, this time can 
be very trying as you worry about the all-or-nothing aspect of 
Kickstarter.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
146
If you find yourself below your goal with just a few days (or hours) 
left, here are some tips that can help you achieve last-minute suc­
cess with your fundraising:
	
✓	Be sure to send out time-sensitive e-mails, Facebook posts, 
Twitter feeds, and more as outlined in Chapter 6. Remember 
to highlight exactly how much time is left, make a compelling 
call to action, and include a link to your fundraising page. 
	
✓	Reach out to your existing backers and ask them to up their 
pledge to help you reach your target goal. There’s nothing 
wrong with asking someone in your life (ideally a close friend or 
relative) to increase his or her pledge (say, by pre-purchasing 
more copies of a product, buying more tickets to an event, 
and so on) to ensure that you meet your goal.
	
✓	Consider looking at your campaign from a new angle: 
Is there a group or professional organization you haven’t 
thought of yet? Might there be a group that you’re not aware 
of but that could be interested in your finished product? For 
example, are you a member of a group with its own specialty 
media or bloggers? A campaign being directed by a retiree 
might be of interest to bloggers for groups like the American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), even if the product 
itself has a wide appeal. A recent campaign led by a paralyzed 
individual was of interest to disability bloggers because the 
campaign showcased how Kickstarter can assist creative 
types who live with a physical disability.
	
You cannot fund your own project; it’s against the rules. Kickstarter 
does not allow you to back a project from your own Amazon 
Payments account. Do not plan on just making up the difference on 
the very last day.
If you can’t raise the funds you need during your campaign, take 
heart. An unsuccessful campaign isn’t a judgment on your idea or 
your abilities to pursue your passion. You can still make the most 
of the content you developed and the lessons you learned along 
the way. Here are ways to follow up on an unsuccessful campaign:
	
✓	First, be sure to thank your backers, as I explain in the upcom­
ing section. 
	
✓	Keep an archive of all the materials, notes, and files you used 
for your campaign; you might be able to use them in another 
Kickstarter project.
	
✓	In reviewing your lessons learned, make a bulleted list — 
within two weeks of the campaign’s end date — of everything 
you would do differently next time.

 Chapter 8: Seeing the Light at the End of Your Campaign 147
	
✓	Within four weeks of the campaign’s end date, make a list of 
the successful campaigns within your category that had a sim­
ilar theme or style; make a point to review those campaigns 
within the next month and see if you can gather any tips or 
tidbits from their projects.
	
✓	On that same list of successful campaigns, consider e-mailing 
a few campaign owners to ask them what their one biggest 
trick for success was. Their responses might help spark new 
ideas.
Thanking Your Backers
Remember, Kickstarter is not just about money — it’s about gath­
ering a group of people who believe in your concept or idea. When 
you come to the end of your project, it’s critical to thank your 
backers, whether you hit your funding goal or not.
To message your backers via your Kickstarter Dashboard, click 
Backer Report in the top center portion of your screen (within the 
black bar across the top). You will see an option to send a message 
to your backers.
Take the time to send each backer an individual e-mail thanking 
them for their support of your project. This is also an excel­
lent opportunity to encourage an ongoing community with your 
backers (again, even if you did not meet your funding goal this 
time).
In your thank-you e-mail, be sure to send backers information on 
where they can follow your project after this initial phase is over. 
Send links they can click to get to
	
✓	Your project’s web page
	
✓	Your Facebook Page
	
✓	Your Twitter Feed
	
✓	YouTube or Google Video Channels for the project
	
✓	A Picasa or Smugmug photo-sharing site
Giving your backers access to this information now allows them 
not only to follow your project after Kickstarter, but also to inter­
act with each other — further enhancing a sense of community.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
148
Building a Community 
around Your Project
As is mentioned previously in this chapter, Kickstarter is not 
just about getting money to fund your idea; it’s about gathering 
together a group of people who all believe in a common goal — in 
essence, a community. These are people who are also passionate 
about your idea and are willing to share that passion with others.
In the past, a sense of community meant neighbors coming 
together and chatting on a street corner or individuals participat­
ing in a town hall. In this digital age, a “community” is any opportu­
nity where participants can share ideas and comments freely and 
collectively. 
Sustaining the community 
after your project ends
Some examples of online community activities include the following:
	
✓	Individuals sharing and forwarding a web page address among 
friends via e-mail
	
✓	People posting and responding to comments on your 
Kickstarter project page, as well as on your project’s own web 
page (if applicable)
	
✓	People around the world “liking” your Facebook page
	
✓	Twitter users posting about your project or re-tweeting any of 
your tweets
	
✓	People mentioning your project or web page in their com­
ments on various websites and news stories online 
	
It’s important to remember that these backers, whether or not 
they ended up funding your project, are interested in your pas­
sion. Although there are many different types of social media and 
ways to stay in touch with backers, remember to pick the methods 
you’re most comfortable with. If you don’t like the brief nature of 
Twitter posts, don’t use it as a tool for communicating with your 
community; stick to methods you like — perhaps e-mail messages 
or posts on your own blog.

 Chapter 8: Seeing the Light at the End of Your Campaign 149
After your campaign is over, I recommend committing to at least 
30 minutes a week online updating your backers, whether or not 
your Kickstarter campaign was successful. That might mean post­
ing a project update on your website or uploading new video snip­
pets to your YouTube channel; it could be something as simple as 
re-tweeting something you think your backers would be interested 
in. Continue this update process throughout and beyond your proj­
ect’s lifespan.
Many Kickstarters continue to use their community developed 
through this process. Writer Dimitri Samarov completed a suc­
cessful Kickstarter campaign in June 2012 for his book, Hack: More 
Stories from a Chicago Cab, a compilation of stories and sketches 
based on his work as a Chicago taxi driver. He previously released a 
successful first compilation, and this was his next series of stories.
Samarov raised over $6,600 through the campaign to fund produc­
tion of this second book, expected for delivery in 2013. After the 
completion of his successful campaign, he has stayed in touch with 
his Kickstarter backers through e-mails gathered in the process 
to let those people interested in his work know about not only his 
Kickstarter campaign book, but also gallery shows for his original 
sketches and an audio CD of an assortment of tales. Each of these 
products has benefited from the continued momentum of keeping 
up with Kickstarter backers.
Fostering your community offline
Even though Kickstarter is a web-based crowdfunding site — and 
most of the communication tools I discuss in other chapters about 
soliciting backers are electronic — it doesn’t mean this is the only 
way to build a community for your project.
Kickstarter is simply a way to begin — to give your concept or idea 
a quick start — a kick-start. After you’ve completed your campaign 
and communicated with backers about how to keep updated on 
your project, it’s important to retain a human element to your 
outreach.
Below is a list of ideas for potential ways to build your community 
offline:

Kickstarter For Dummies 
150
	
✓	Invite all your backers in your town to join you at your 
favorite local pub or restaurant for a happy hour. This is not 
to imply that you’re hosting everyone or paying for everyone, 
just creating an opportunity for backers to come together at 
the same time and get to meet up.
	
✓	Attend or organize gatherings around a topic or interest 
related to your project. Speaking of meeting up, a great tool 
is www.meetup.com. This social networking site helps people 
interested in the same topic to find each other and meet up 
in real life at events and programs. If there is a Meetup group 
that matches the interests of your project, try attending it — 
and inviting other backers to come with you.
	
	Figure 8-1 shows an example of a Meetup relevant to people 
interested in art, specifically painting and figure drawing.
	
✓	Attend events by others in similar categories to your 
Kickstarter project. In your community, look at the Calendar 
section of the local newspaper, search online for sites like 
www.patch.com, or pick up your free weekly entertainment 
guide if the city has one. Browse listings for events and stop 
by one or two, inviting a few backers to join you — and be 
sure to bring along information on your own project to share!
Figure 8-1: Use online tools like Meetup to build your community offline.

Delivering Rewards to Your Backers
When you come to the end of your campaign, if it’s successful, you 
need to do a few tasks right away to ensure successful delivery 
of your backer rewards: Generate your Backer Report and survey 
your backers.
Downloading your Backer Report
To generate a report of all your backers and relevant data about 
their rewards, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to your Dashboard on the main Kickstarter page.
	
	 You will see an overview of all Project Activity listed in 
several graphical forms. Figure 8-2 shows a sample Project 
Activity page. 
	
2.	Print this entire page for your records.
	
3.	On the top navigation bar, click Backer Report to see an 
aggregate of all your pledges, grouped by pledge amount; 
print this entire page as well for your records.
	
	 Figure 8-3 shows an example of an aggregated Backer 
Report. For each pledge level, you see a blue arrow and 
View Report link on the right. 
Figure 8-2: This is how a Project Activity page looks at the conclusion of a project.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
152
	
4.	Click View Report for your first backer level, as shown in 
Figure 8-4.
	
	 You see a list of all backers at that level and several key 
tools you will want to use: Generate Report, Message All, 
and Create a Survey. Figure 8-5 shows the various tools 
available inside your report.
Figure 8-3: An aggregated Backer Report.
Figure 8-4: Drilling down to the first backer level.

 Chapter 8: Seeing the Light at the End of Your Campaign 153
Figure 8-5: Tools available inside the Backer Report.
	
5.	Click the Download Report button near the top and 
center of the screen.
	
	 A pop-up window asks you to verify that you wish to down­
load the report.
	
6.	Click Download again.
	
	 The information on backers in that level will download to 
your computer as a CSV (comma-separated values) format 
file, compatible with Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc, and 
other spreadsheet programs. By default, the file is saved 
in your Downloads or My Downloads folder, depending on 
your computer.
	
7.	Click the Back button on your browser and repeat this 
same process for each of your individual backer levels.
	
	 Each file will download separately, organized by backer 
level. Figure 8-6 shows a sample Backer Report. Note that 
I deleted confidential backer information to show you the 
report in this book; the actual report you get is complete 
with full names and e-mail addresses.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
154
Figure 8-6: Sample Backer Report in CSV format.
Surveying your backers
After downloading all your Backer Reports and printing out your 
Project Activity pages, it’s important to determine whether you 
have all the information you need from backers to deliver their 
rewards.
If everything you’re offering can be delivered electronically (for 
example via e-mail), then the e-mail address each backer provided 
during their registration should be sufficient. However, if you’re 
offering anything else (copies of products, special services, invita­
tions to events, and so on), it’s important to get the information 
required from backers as soon as possible.
To do that, you use Kickstarter’s survey feature. This is not an 
opinion survey, but a survey to specifically gather required data 
from your backers. Figure 8-7 shows the Create a Survey button 
inside your Backer Report.

 Chapter 8: Seeing the Light at the End of Your Campaign 155
Figure 8-7: Create a Survey button.
The following steps walk you through the process of creating a 
survey:
	
1.	Click the Create a Survey button inside each individual 
level of Backer Report. 
	
	 You see several boxes that enable you to request informa­
tion from backers, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Figure 8-8: Creating a survey with the Backer Report tools.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
156
	
2.	Select the Introduction to Survey option and type a short 
explanation of why you’re conducting the survey.
	
3.	Keep the Name & Address box selected (it’s selected 
by default) if you need to request a backer’s mailing 
address.
	
	 Ask for addresses if you’re sending backers a product. 
	
	 If there are special requests or other needs — for example, 
sizes of T-shirts or favorite varieties of a food product 
you’re producing, there is also an option to add as many 
other questions as you’d like (as shown in Figure 8-9).
Figure 8-9: Adding a custom question into a backer survey.
	
4.	If you need to ask an open-ended question, click the Add 
Question option and type your question. 
	
	 In the resulting survey, backers can enter their response in 
a text box.
	
5.	If you want backers to choose from a limited set of 
answers, click Add Multiple Choice Question and fill out 
the question and options on the screen that appears. 
	
	 This is a good option to use if, for example, your T-shirt 
sizes are limited to small, medium, large, and extra large. 

 Chapter 8: Seeing the Light at the End of Your Campaign 157
You don’t want backers to respond with sizes you don’t 
have, like extra small or extra-extra large).
	
6.	Review your survey information to make sure it’s com­
plete and accurate, and then click Send Survey.
As your backers respond to your survey questions, their information 
will be updated in the Backer Report. To check how many back­
ers have replied, click Backer Report from your main Dashboard 
(again, in the top center black bar). There, you will be able to 
determine how many people have replied to your survey and who 
has not yet responded. Once you get all the information needed 
from all the backers in one level, re-download the backer report 
(as outlined earlier in this chapter) and replace your older version 
with this newer one which has more information.
	
You may need to complete this process several times or send 
reminder e-mails to your backers to get the information needed. 
Don’t give up! Be sure to re-send survey requests until all your 
backers have sent the information you’ve requested.
Keeping Up with Kickstarter
Once you’ve completed your project, surveyed all your backers, 
downloaded complete Backer Reports, and posted your final 
update, you’re done with the Kickstarter page, right? Wrong!
To stay connected with Kickstarter and all the great projects 
(including some that might be a good fit with yours), you can regu­
larly visit the Kickstarter Blog (www.kickstarter.com/blog). 
It’s a good idea to visit the blog at least once a week for the posts 
related to This Week in Kickstarter, highlighting cool new concepts, 
projects, and milestones. Figure 8-10 shows a sample blog entry.
Beyond getting the weekly update, browse around for featured 
projects and other news from the Kickstarter staff. If you see 
a project that you like or could be affiliated with yours, be sure 
to click and back it. Also, each blog entry is associated with a 
Kickstarter author. When you click an entry that you’re inter­
ested in, click the author’s name (highlighted in blue), to see 
what other projects he or she is interested in or has backed (as 
seen in Figure 8-11).
Whether or not your particular campaign was successful, keeping 
up with Kickstarter this way can give you inspiration for your next 
project.

Ten Unique Reward Ideas
In This Chapter
▶	Comparing ten real-world rewards for backers
▶	Discovering what makes a reward unique
T

his chapter examines some creative ideas for one of the most 
important parts of your Kickstarter campaign: backer rewards. 
People will likely want something in return for their pledges, and 
in this chapter, you find ten intriguing ideas from a variety of 
Kickstarter campaigns — both successful and unsuccessful. Even 
if the campaign may not have reached its ultimate funding goal (for 
whatever reason), the campaign creator may have come up with 
some clever rewards for backers, and they are included here for 
that reason.
“Cover Me!”: Featuring 
Backers on Your Cover
If you’re creating something with a cover — like a book, comic, 
album, or magazine — what about incorporating your backers’ 
names or photos into the cover art?
If there is an opportunity to work a backer’s image into the art, 
that could be a lot of fun! Perhaps you could feature his or her 
photograph on the back cover as an original backer?
	
Remember that your cover is one important way to sell your fin­
ished product, so you can’t let a backer’s image interfere with the 
message of the product; you’ll need to work with your designer to 
integrate the backer’s photo cleverly into the art. Perhaps a fun 
“Where’s Waldo?” type of look? Or maybe you work the backer’s 
name into the image with a fun typeface or font.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
160
This type of backer reward should be limited in quantity, unless 
you’re making your entire front or back cover about your backers. 
I would recommend limiting this reward to maybe 2–5 backers total.
Figure 9-1 shows an example of a campaign organized by VOTA, a 
band that used Kickstarter to raise funds for recording an album. 
For backers who donated $45 or more, VOTA offered to feature 
their photos in a mosaic on the album cover. By choosing a 
mosaic, VOTA could offer this reward to up to 675 backers. (It’s 
worth noting that, if 675 people had chosen this reward, the band 
would have basically doubled its fundraising goal. See Chapter 
3 for details about balancing your fundraising goal with your 
rewards.) VOTA was also smart to consider how backers’ photos 
would be featured in the cover design in the reward description. 
This way, backers could have clear expectations for how their 
photos would appear — and VOTA could plan the album cover 
ahead of time. 
Figure 9-1: Backer option on VOTA album cover at $45 backer level.

 Chapter 9: Ten Unique Reward Ideas 161
“The Shirt Off Your Back”: 
Offering T-Shirts
T-shirts have always been a popular giveaway item. Whether 
you’re running in a race, participating in a charity walk, or 
supporting a school function, a commemorative T-shirt is often a 
desirable reward for a pledge. 
	
You should consider a T-shirt as a backer reward for several reasons:
	
✓	T-shirts are often inexpensive to produce.
	
✓	You can produce a large or small quantity.
	
✓	T-shirts promote your brand/product identity outside of 
Kickstarter.
	
✓	T-shirts are gender- and age-neutral.
Be sure to enter your T-shirt production costs into your overall 
Kickstarter budget if you’re going to use this as a reward. (See 
Chapter 3 for budgeting.) The only exception is if a kind friend or 
business associate is donating the shirts and their production. 
(But don’t forget the shipping.)
	
Because the T-shirt is also a familiar way to promote your brand or 
product well beyond Kickstarter, be sure to come up with a design 
that will communicate your message to someone who may know 
nothing about it.
Figure 9-2 shows a sample reward T-shirt.
In this instance, backers get T-shirts as a thank-you for their sup­
port to make the podcasts happen. As a bonus, the T-shirts them­
selves feature a cool design and might be something the potential 
backer would want to order anyway, even if it didn’t help support 
a creative project.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
162
Figure 9-2: Pollyanna Cowgirl Records Podcast offered a T-shirt reward at the 
$15 backer level.
“Naming Rights”: Including 
a Backer as a Character
Have you ever wanted to be a character in a movie, book, or TV 
show? It’s likely your backers have wanted that too — at least to 
have a character named after them! This reward is a creative way 
to have your backer be forever linked to your project.
If your project is a work of fiction, how about naming a character 
after a backer? This is usually reserved for a higher-end backer, 
unless you have hundreds of characters to choose from.
Figure 9-3 shows a high-end reward for the Plunder game, where a 
backer gets to “become” a character. Here are a few notable points 
about this example:
	
✓	The reward description spells out details about how the char­
acter would be included in the game.
	
✓	The creator mentions up-front the right to reject backer ideas 
for the character.

 Chapter 9: Ten Unique Reward Ideas 163
Figure 9-3: Character naming reward at $10,000 level in Plunder.
“Autograph, Please”: 
Signing Your Work
An original author’s/artist’s signature on any work will make it 
more valuable than an unsigned piece. Whether or not your book 
goes on to become a bestseller or your gallery show leads to 
worldwide acclaim, giving your backers a signed copy of your fin­
ished piece enhances value without costing you anything.
	
When considering your backer levels, look at the idea of creating 
two offers, one slightly higher than the other, that are differenti­
ated by a signature. Even if one offer is only $5 more than the 
other, if a larger percentage of backers go for the signed copy, 
you’ll reach your Kickstarter goal faster.
Figure 9-4 below shows rewards for a signed copy of an album, 
plus a slightly higher reward for people who want the album before 
it becomes available on iTunes.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
164
Figure 9-4: Signed copies of an album by Lucas Cook.
“Casting Call”: Rewarding 
Backers with Bit Parts
Do you think some of your backers dream of seeing themselves on 
the big or small screen? Do you have aspiring actors in your net­
work of friends? The idea of casting someone in your project is a 
fun and engaging reward idea.
Depending on the backer level, you can offer a number of walk-on 
roles for your project. Perhaps you can include these backers as 
extras or crowd fillers, or a backer could walk through a scene to 
create action. Whatever the role, giving your backers a chance to 
actually be in your project definitely connects them to it for the 
long haul — and will encourage them to share the project with 
others.
Figure 9-5 shows a backer offer for a role as an extra on the 
Oblivion web series.

 Chapter 9: Ten Unique Reward Ideas 165
Figure 9-5: Extra role for backer on Oblivion web series.
“Curtain Call”: Sharing 
Tickets to Your Show
Many Kickstarter campaigns have to do with production of a show 
or performance — live theater, performance art, concerts, and so 
on. If you’re using Kickstarter to produce a live event, how about 
offering free seats to your backers?
In reality, it’s not a free seat, because backers are pledging an 
amount to support your campaign as a whole. However, if you 
word your reward with “Free Tickets,” “Complimentary Entry,” and 
so forth, backers feel like they are getting something for free — 
and they are: They don’t have to shell out for a ticket at the event.
When creating a backer reward that includes free seats or tickets 
for an event, be sure your reward level at least covers what you 
would hope to sell those seats for. For example, if tickets to your 
concert will cost $20 each and you have a backer reward that 
includes two tickets to the show, make sure that backer reward is 
priced at $40 or more.
Figure 9-6 shows tickets included to a production of Screwtape. In this 
campaign, backers who give more to the production get extra perks 
with their tickets, such as a choice of which performance to attend. 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
166

“Hero Worship”: Making a Backer 
the Hero of Your Project
This is a bit of a twist on an earlier idea, naming rights, but it 
applies most specifically to books or comics with a true hero or 
champion.
If you have one level of backer rewards for character naming, per­
haps you have a second tier, with even more limited availability, 
where your backer could be the hero of the story.
For those producing a comic, this a true opportunity for one of 
your backers to become a superhero. You can work with your 
backer(s) to determine what special powers he or she would have, 
how the character would look, and even brainstorm the outcome 
of the character’s adventure!
	
Because this type of commitment involves a lot of interaction 
with the backer, make sure the requirements are outlined clearly 
in your rewards and limit the number of rewards available at this 
level. The Hyper-Heroes project, shown in Figure 9-7, limited its 
hero reward to three backers and set the backer level at $5,000.

“Dinner Guest”: Meeting 
Your Backers in Person
Food is always a great way to connect with others. Try using it as 
a creative backer reward! Most likely, many of your backers will be 
within your home city or close by.
There are two ideas here for using food as a reward for backers:
	
✓	Offering to cook a meal for a select backer at his or her home, 
or host a group of backers at your home
	
✓	Hosting a meal/reception/happy hour for a large group of 
backers all at once
Each type of food-related reward has its own benefits. If you host a 
small, intimate dinner party, you have the option of really showing 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
168
your backers how much you appreciate their support with a home-
cooked meal. Of course, you need to have space to host a dinner 
party and the skills needed to pull this off!
If a home-cooked, small dinner party is not an option, another 
approach is to host a dinner at a local restaurant or cater a get-
together at an appropriate location. You can open up this level 
of reward to more backers (keep in mind that it will probably be 
more expensive than offering a home-cooked meal).
It’s important to consider the costs of each option — and be sure 
to add those costs to your overall project budget if you’re going to 
offer these rewards.
Again, be sure to limit the number of backers at these levels and 
ensure that you can deliver on the end result! You must also 
clearly lay out the size of group for each reward — and specify the 
distance you’re willing to travel for fulfillment.
Figure 9-8 shows a $250 backer reward from my campaign, The 
Finding 40 Project, offering a home-cooked meal.
Figure 9-8: Home-cooked meal at $250 reward level for The Finding 40 Project.

 Chapter 9: Ten Unique Reward Ideas 169
“Sign Me Up”: Offering 
Subscriptions
If your Kickstarter campaign is launching a series that might con­
tinue month after month or year after year, consider offering an 
ongoing subscription or membership to backers.
This type of reward encourages backers to believe in the project 
long term and also allows you to basically pre-sell subscriptions, 
ensuring readership or membership beyond your launch period.
Again, as with the tickets idea, be sure that the contribution at this 
backer level truly covers the cost of an ongoing subscription — and 
that you spell out the length of the subscription (usually a year but 
some subscriptions run for two years). Other subscription-style 
rewards offer a set number of issues instead of a timeframe-based 
subscription. 
As an example, if you’re creating a quarterly magazine with an 
annual subscription rate of $40, I would recommend that any 
reward offering a subscription start no lower than $40, ideally 
closer to $100.
Figure 9-9 shows Thirty-Two magazine and a backer level that fea­
tures a year-long subscription to the publication.

subscription.

“Fly Me to the Moon”: Bringing an 
Out-of-Town Backer to an Event
Well, maybe not to the moon . . . but how about to your premiere, 
or to your project’s launch party? 
Bringing a backer in from out of town to support your project defi­
nitely adds a sense of drama or excitement to the launch. If you 
have a backer who has wanted to see you anyway and lives out of 
town, this is a great way to combine a visit with a pledge to back 
your project.
Another option is to create a vacation package around your pre­
miere or launch. Talk to managers at local hotels and see if they 
might be interested in donating a room night or two to your proj­
ect in exchange for publicity or exposure on your website or at 
your event. 
Do you have unused reward miles or credit-card reward points? 
Consider offering them up as part of a reward package as well; you 
could create a getaway package to visit your town. See if you can 
get donated or discounted tickets to local attractions to round out 
the package. This might be appealing to a backer you don’t even 
know but who is interested in visiting your city!
Again, remember that anything you have to purchase for this 
reward level needs to be entered into your budget against your 
project’s bottom line. This type of reward needs to be priced cor­
rectly as well.
If you need to spend $400 on an average plane ticket plus $500 on 
hotel rooms and event attraction tickets for a package reward, 
don’t price your reward level any lower than $1,000. Ideally, you 
want this package to help generate revenue for your project, not 
just cover hard costs. 
	
The more resources you can get discounted or donated for this 
type of reward, the greater the revenue you can generate. 
Figure 9-10 shows a backer reward that features hotel accommoda­
tions for the Dig South Interactive Conference and Expo.

Ten Resources to Help 
with Your Campaign
In This Chapter

▶	Putting together a budget and a business plan
▶	Writing clear campaign copy
▶	Designing a website for your campaign
▶	Taking great photos
▶	Promoting your project and or a supporting event
S

o far, hopefully, this book has given you lots of ideas and tips 
for making your Kickstarter campaign a success. There are 
countless other places you can go for inspiration and guidance. 
In this chapter, I outline ten additional ways you can boost your 
campaign by seeking outside information and developing potential 
skills you need for your Kickstarter campaign.
Finding Kickstarter-Specific 
Resources
Thanks to Kickstarter’s explosive success, there are now a number 
of websites specifically developed to help you manage your cam­
paign and reward deliveries. Here are a few of my favorites:
	
✓	Kicktraq (www.kicktraq.com): Allows you to monitor 
your campaign’s status and forecasts campaign outcomes. 
Kicktraq also offers other campaign tips and a regularly 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
174
updated blog. Figure 10-1 shows a sample tracking and 
forecast for a Kickstarter campaign in progress, “Take the 
Plunge.”
	
✓	BackerKit (www.backerkit.com): This new website gives 
Kickstarter campaign owners the basic tools and tips to 
deliver rewards to backers. For many Kickstarter campaign 
owners, failure to deliver rewards has been a big issue. 
BackerKit is an option if you find yourself overwhelmed with 
delivery. Figure 10-2 shows the BackerKit site, where you can 
start learning more about this service.
	
	
BackerKit costs money. If you plan to use it for delivering your 
rewards, be sure to add the hard cost into your budget.
	
✓	The Kickstarter Tumblr page (http://kickstarter.
tumblr.com): An ongoing blog written by the team behind 
Kickstarter with interesting tidbits and notes about ongoing 
campaigns and successful project tips.
Figure 10-1: Kicktraq page showing progress and likelihood of the “Take the 
Plunge” project’s success.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 175

Learning from Other 
Kickstarter Stories
In Chapter 2, I discuss reviewing other Kickstarter’s campaigns 
as a way to gauge your own potential campaign and get a sense 
for what others in your potential category are doing. There are a 
number of great web and news sites where you can also search 
for keywords like “Kickstarter” and see what others have written 
about Kickstarter campaigns:
	
✓	Mashable (www.mashable.com): This site frequently has 
stories about ongoing campaigns and ideas from other users, 
as well as reporter commentary. Check back often and search 
“Kickstarter” on the main page for most recent stories, as 
shown in Figure 10-3.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
176
Figure 10-3: Mashable home page with “Kickstarter” search.
	
✓	The Huffington Post (www.huffingtonpost.com): This site 
often aggregates news from a variety of sources all over the 
web. As with Mashable.com, simply enter Kickstarter in the 
search box at the top of the page to see what stories are trend­
ing that relate to Kickstarter projects around the country.
Budgeting for Your Project
Chapter 3 reviews the steps in creating a successful Kickstarter 
campaign budget. In the chapter I recommend using a spreadsheet-
type program such as Microsoft Excel. If you are not familiar with 
how to use spreadsheets, check out the tips for several versions 
of Excel at Dummies.com. Simply type the version you have 
(such as Excel 2013) into the search box. Or check out Excel For 
Dummies by Greg Harvey.
If you don’t have access to Microsoft Excel and don’t want to pur­
chase a copy of the software, there are other, free resources such 
as the OpenOffice Calc program, that offer the basic spreadsheet 
functions you’ll need, such as tabulating data and performing basic 
calculations.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 177
Figure 10-4 shows the OpenOffice.org web page for its Calc pro­
gram. OpenOffice is actually an entire suite of products that also 
includes a word processor and a slideshow program.
Figure 10-4: Calc is a good alternative to Excel if you need a spreadsheet 
program.
Making a Business Plan
Remember, Kickstarter is all about getting a project up and 
running — giving it that proverbial “kick-start.” Just having a suc­
cessful Kickstarter campaign doesn’t mean your project will actu­
ally be successful. It’s up to you to make good use of the support 
and money from your backers to make your project into a viable 
venture.
Because each individual campaign and product is inherently differ­
ent, there is no one-size-fits-all model business plan to follow, but 
you should create at least a basic business plan that lays out how 
you will maintain and make money with your project.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
178
Start your web search for business plan resources here:
	
✓	Dummies.com (www.dummies.com): From the home page, 
do a search for business plan to find articles that can help 
you determine what to include in your business plan and 
how to monitor your progress based on your plan. For a 
more comprehensive guide on how to create and manage 
a winning business plan, check out Business Plans For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Paul Tiffany, Steven D. Peterson, 
and Colin Barrow.
	
✓	Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov): The SBA 
is dedicated to helping small businesses succeed, and your 
Kickstarter campaign is its own small business. This compre­
hensive website even has a step-by-step free tool for making 
your own business plan, as shown in Figure 10-5. You can 
access this free tool by clicking the Starting and Managing 
tab on the SBA home page and then clicking the Create Your 
Business Plan heading on the next page.
	
✓	Bplans (www.bplans.com): This website is designed for a 
variety of types of businesses, with lots of options when it 
comes to creating your own business plan. You can also find 
links here to tools such as LivePlan, which is business plan 
development software for purchase (as a monthly subscrip­
tion ranging from $11 – $20), as shown in Figure 10-6.

Writing Well
Throughout this book I call attention to the need to tell your 
Kickstarter story through words and video. If you are not a profes­
sional writer — or need some help with basic copy editing — there 
are several outstanding resources out there.
A classic tool in almost every writer’s toolkit is The Elements of 
Style by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. This pocket-sized but 
powerful guide explains basic grammar, principles for composing 
clear and effective prose, and how to avoid misusing or misspelling 
words and expressions that often trap the unwary. An afternoon 
spent reading this slim guide can help you improve your writing. 
The Elements of Style is a gem if you need help with turning your 
ideas into text or using terms properly. You can often find this 
book for sale new or used. Figure 10-7 shows used copies available 
for $3.68 on Amazon.com.
Another tool for writing assistance is an online platform like Wordy 
(https://wordy.com/copy-editing/), where you can upload 
your draft and receive feedback and edits from professional 

Kickstarter For Dummies 
180
editors and copywriters. This can be helpful if you feel stuck in 
the writing process or are struggling to make transitions between 
ideas. Wordy is a paid service, so if you are going to use this to 
help write your Kickstarter descriptions or other materials, be 
sure to add the cost into your overall budget.
Figure 10-7: The Elements of Style available from only $3.68.
Copywriting Well
Copywriting is writing that’s focused on advertising or publicity. 
You are copywriting for your campaign page when you write 
your short blurb or your long description (see Chapter 2) or 
write text for a website or blog that helps to support your cam­
paign. (See the upcoming section in this chapter for help with a 
website.) 
If you’re daunted by the idea of writing promotional copy for a 
website — or if you’ve never done a single blog post — several 
good web-based tools can get you in the swing of it.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 181
Copy Blogger (www.copyblogger.com) is a website created 
originally by blogger Brian Clark in 2006 to help others struggling 
with content creation. 
The site prides itself on being able to teach anyone how to create 
“killer content.” This could be extremely helpful to you if you are 
unsure about what to post in order to attract attention and drive 
traffic to your project’s campaign page and website.
The Copy Blogger website offers some content for free. Although 
you have to pay to access its premium services, such as content 
marketing software and web hosting, these could be worthwhile 
expenses if you are acquiring skills that will help you grow your 
backer base. Remember to add any such paid services to your 
project’s list of hard costs.
Figure 10-8 shows recent posts on the Copy Blogger site, where 
you are free to browse to get content and copy ideas from others 
around the web:
Figure 10-8: Content ideas on the Copy Blogger website.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
182
Another tried-and-true tool for getting started on copywriting (or 
if you’re already writing but stuck) is a good old-fashioned the­
saurus. Of course, as a full-fledged member of the digital age, you 
might want to check out a few options that don’t require you to 
crack open a giant volume:
	
✓	Use the Thesaurus function on your word-processing software. 
If you find yourself repeating the same word or struggling to 
communicate your idea, let technology help you! Type in the 
word you are trying to work around and see what other options 
pop up.
	
✓	If you’re a visual thinker, try using a website like the ThinkMap 
Visual Thesaurus (www.visualthesaurus.com). This type 
of tool maps out word associations visually. You’re directed 
to a series of possible connected words based on your origi­
nal search term. You are able to drill not only down, but also 
around, in all directions, to find the right fit. Figure 10-9 shows 
the Visual Thesaurus website.
Figure 10-9: The Visual Thesaurus search function.
Writing Press Releases
In Chapters 6 and 8, I talk about getting the word out about your 
campaign, potentially reaching out to bloggers and writers that 
might cover your industry or neighborhood.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 183
If you’ve never worked with a reporter before or sent out a press 
release, the prospect of tooting your own horn might seem a bit 
overwhelming. It’s really not! Reporters are always looking for 
good stories and community activities, and if you have created a 
compelling call to action for your backers, that tells a good chunk 
of your Kickstarter story right there.
You may want to send press materials to reporters who would be 
able to write a story in time to benefit your campaign. See Chapter 6 
for more details about paying to promote your Kickstarter campaign 
and making sure you advertise in a vehicle that fits your timeline.
A concise press release that announces your Kickstarter project, 
funding goal, end date, and relevant links to websites or other con­
tent can be a great way to communicate with bloggers and writers.
Three stellar resources are
	
✓	Public Relations Society of America (www.prsa.org): 
Learn about training programs and events that can help you 
build a press release. PRSA also has a student chapter called 
PRSSA, also found through the main PRSA website; you may 
be able to locate a chapter in your town and find a student 
willing to help you with PR for your campaign to boost his or 
her résumé.
	
✓	PRWeb (www.prweb.com): PRWeb is primarily an online 
tool for disseminating your press release to a large audience. 
Although this service might not be a good fit for your proj­
ect, the site has excellent articles, such as “What is a Press 
Release?” and “How to Write a Successful Press Release,” as 
shown in Figure 10-10.
	
	
The site even has a free white paper available for down­
load, called “An Expert Guide to Writing Great Online News 
Releases,” that goes into even more depth.
	
✓	AP Stylebook (http://apstylebook.com): The Associated 
Press Stylebook is the Bible for anyone who writes for journal­
ists or the media. A perennial bestseller, this book explains 
the guidelines for writing in news style, giving your press 
release a greater chance at getting picked up. The website 
gives you information on purchasing the most recent version 
as well as an interactive “Ask the Editor” section that lets you 
search thousands of queries to zero in on dilemmas of writing 
style, as shown in Figure 10-11.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 185
Building a Basic Website
In addition to your Kickstarter campaign page, I recommend that 
you create at least a basic website for your Kickstarter project. 
Ideally, you have the website up and running before your campaign 
launches. Even if your site goes live after your campaign begins, 
you can still use it as a tool to communicate with backers when the 
campaign is over.
Your project website is a vital tool for connecting with a large 
number of people at once. Similar to your actual Kickstarter cam­
paign, your project website needs to communicate the basics of 
your overall idea and passions. Each project is unique, but at the 
very minimum, you should think about building a site with the fol­
lowing categories of information:
	
✓	About the project
	
✓	Inspiration or background
	
✓	About you
	
✓	Photos or videos of the project
	
✓	Any links to the project in the news or blogs
Figure 10-12 shows the website for Creita, a company that creates 
innovative wire-mesh jewelry that can be molded into a variety 
of shapes. Creita had a successful Kickstarter campaign, raising 
funds to participate in fashion shows and events and getting the 
company on its way to a full production run. Notice how Creita 
has a website that mimics many of the things required in a good 
Kickstarter campaign, including strong visuals, videos, a back­
story, and press mentions. Note that the site is not particularly 
complex — and now features a Shop button to allow direct user 
purchases.
Figure 10-13 is an excellent, straightforward website that mirrors 
a currently running Kickstarter campaign for “Powered by Green 
Smoothies.” Filmmaker Sergei Boutenko is hoping to raise $50,000 
for a full-length documentary showcasing the health effects of all-
green smoothies on a variety of individuals, including athletes. The 
website hits on several of the key elements, including About, Events, 
Photos, and Videos. This site is primarily blog-driven, meaning that 
most of the content comes from the user posting updates and per­
sonal comments that highlight the filmmaker’s passion.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
186
Figure 10-12: Creita website with good examples of basic categories.
Figure 10-13: “Powered by Green Smoothies” filmmaker’s website.
Of course, there are entire books, courses, and even college 
degrees on website design, but you don’t need to be an expert on 
website design and maintenance. A basic site can be very helpful 
for promotion of your Kickstarter campaign.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 187
Thankfully, there are several free or low-cost resources that can 
handle most of the back-end work and still present a nice basic site 
to your backers or potential backers. I review two choices in the 
following sections and outline some options to consider for each.
	
In Chapter 3, I discuss building a solid budget, and one line item to 
consider is any cost for constructing, maintaining, and promoting 
an individual website for your project.
WordPress.com
WordPress.com is by far the most popular and widely used web­
site for free website creation. This site enables you to choose from 
different predesigned themes for your site. Each theme offers a dif­
ferent overall look and feel for the finished site. Figure 10-14 shows 
a small sampling of the available WordPress themes.
Some of the themes are free, meaning you only have to create 
an account to begin the design process, and others are premium 
themes, meaning you pay a fee to download and use the features 
of the theme.
Figure 10-14: Sample WordPress.com themes.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
188
Most of the technology behind WordPress is drag-and-drop, which 
means you work within a visual interface and don’t have to know 
HTML or other web-based languages to build a website. 
I recommend that you start by reviewing the free themes to get a 
sense of how WordPress.com works, because these themes are 
simplest to use. After you feel a bit more confident, try using a 
Premium theme, which may have advanced features such as
	
✓	Animated graphics
	
✓	Photo sliders or slideshows that constantly update
	
✓	Sidebars or widgets that you can customize
	
✓	Custom backgrounds or fonts
	
✓	Different selections for main posts, aside posts, and callouts
Figure 10-15 below shows a sample web page using the Avid theme, 
specifically designed for photo-heavy blogs.
Figure 10-15: Sample blog using Avid WordPress theme.
WordPress.com hosts your website for free, which means the files 
you create via the visual interface are stored on the WordPress 
web servers. (Your website files must reside on a web server so 
that your website visitors’ browsers can access the files when visi­
tors type in your site’s web address.) 

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 189
When you use WordPress.com to host your site, your default web­
site address (also known as a domain name) is www.wordpress.
com/YOURADDRESSHERE.com. You can keep that address or 
create your own via a process called domain registration. Using 
the default address is faster and easier than registering your own 
domain, but I recommend spending the time and money (between 
$7–$39 per year depending on what you register) creating your 
own website address. For example, the website I created for my 
Finding 40 Kickstarter project is www.finding40.net. Having a 
web address that matches my project name keeps the branding for 
my project simple and focused and helps people interested in my 
project find it online. 
To use your own domain name with a WordPress.com website, 
here are the overall steps to follow:
	
1.	Visit a domain name registrar to make sure the name 
you want is available and follow the registrar’s steps to 
reserve your desired domain name.
	
	 You can register any name you like as long as no one else 
has taken it. As I mention earlier, you most likely want your 
domain name to match your project name. The two best-
known and least expensive registrars are www.1and1.com 
and www.GoDaddy.com. WordPress.com also provides 
a domain registration service through its store. You can 
also check out providers such as www.name.com and www.
namecheap.com for website domain services.
	
2.	After you register your domain, point your WordPress.com 
blog to your domain.
	
	 As this book goes to press, you have to pay about $20 per 
year to use your own domain name with a WordPress.com 
blog or website. Click the Store link in your WordPress.com 
dashboard and follow the instructions to add a domain.
For more details about using WordPress to create a website, check 
out the WordPress articles at Dummies.com or the book WordPress 
For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
The more advanced you get with a WordPress site, the more you 
can add in, including a shopping solution (allowing people to buy 
directly from your site), ticket sales, and other embedded adver­
tisements and commerce opportunities.

Kickstarter For Dummies

Blogger
Blogger is part of Google, and like the name implies, it is mostly 
designed for creating fairly basic blogs. Go to www.blogger.com 
and click the button that says Take a Quick Tour to get a basic 
sense of how this service works.
As with WordPress, you can design a page visually by choosing 
and customizing themes. You don’t need to know HTML to use 
Blogger; it’s easy for a novice website creator to use.
	
As with WordPress, you can host your blog on Blogger for free, 
meaning you’ll have an address that is preceded with http://
blogspot.YOURBLOGNAME.com. If you want to create a blog with 
your own unique web address, register your domain before you 
start your blog. Doing so will make setting up your blog easier than 
trying to change the default blogspot name later.
Figure 10-16 shows a sample of the Blogger Dashboard.
Figure 10-16: Dashboard inside a Blogger page.
Sites created using Blogger will not have as many theme options 
available as the hundreds of WordPress themes. Blogger themes 
are usually simpler and designed for more basic photo sharing 
and blogging. Of course, there is an entire aftermarket where 
you can buy or download other Blogger themes and expand the 

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 191
functionality of your Blogspot page — but again, consider how 
much time and energy you can put into this part of your project, 
and plan accordingly.
It’s also important to remember that Blogger, as part of Google, 
may not remain free forever or may change significantly over time; 
be sure to have a back up plan in place if a free website service 
should suddenly become unavailable.
Tumblr
This popular blog creation website currently boasts over 100 mil­
lion users worldwide, including Kickstarter, which uses Tumblr 
for its own blog mentioned earlier in this chapter. Tumblr (www.
tumblr.com) users can create a site also using drag-and-drop 
technology similar to WordPress and Blogger, and the Tumblr 
community has better search functions to tag your blog with key­
words, making it easier for anyone who just comes to the main 
Tumblr web page to find your Tumblr page.
There are countless other tools out there for building websites; the 
list is always changing. To peruse some of the most recent offerings, 
try a Google search for “Free Web Site Creation” or “Making Your Own 
Web Site.” You’ll see more choices than you ever thought possible.
Taking Great Photos
As you’ve seen throughout this book, many of the most successful 
Kickstarter campaigns give backers a real sense of what they’re 
supporting — often through strong and clear photographs.
Because the Internet is such a visual medium, anything you post as 
part of your Kickstarter campaign needs to pop off the monitor or 
tablet and grab the viewer’s attention as much as possible.
	
Here are a few basic tips I have gathered when it comes to shoot­
ing and posting photographs as part of your Kickstarter campaign:
	
✓	Keep your photos as uncluttered as possible, focusing on the 
Kickstarter item or descriptive point itself.
	
✓	If necessary, use an image editor to crop or otherwise remove 
elements that take away from your main message. For exam­
ple, if you took a photo of a building you’re trying to convert 
to a theater and people in the background detract from the 
image, think about removing them from the image before 
posting it to your Kickstarter campaign page or elsewhere.

Kickstarter For Dummies 
192
	
✓	Bright, colorful images will pop off the screen; black and white 
images will meld with text.
	
✓	When you post the photo of yourself in your profile, pick a 
photo that really shows your personality and face. If possible, 
do a head and shoulders shot or simple head shot.
	
✓	If you are producing something that will end up being a col­
lection (like the Pebble E-Paper Watch that came in multiple 
colors), post photographs of each item individually, as well as 
a group shot so people can see the finished collection.
	
✓	Remember to lower the resolution before posting! If you take 
a photo with a digital camera (or even your smartphone) as 
part of your campaign, each of those individual photos might 
be a 2MB (or bigger) file. If you upload them directly as-is into 
your Kickstarter Dashboard, they’ll be so large that they’ll 
load sluggishly when someone tries to view them. Use your 
photo-editing tool to save a lower-resolution version of the 
image and upload that smaller picture! See Dummies.com for 
tips and articles about saving and optimizing images for the 
web. Also, be sure to always keep your original high-resolution 
photo on file; you will need that for any printed materials.
Promoting Your Project or Event
In Chapter 6, I discuss the idea of hosting or participating in a 
promotional event to get the word out about your Kickstarter cam­
paign and upcoming deadline. There are several tools that can be 
helpful when promoting an event of this type:
	
✓	Eventbrite.com is a catch-all event-listing and planning 
website, with a huge calendar of events searchable by neigh­
borhood, type of event, date, and cost. Anyone can post details 
of an event here simply by creating a free Eventbrite account. 
Eventbrite also lets guests pre-purchase tickets to your event 
(if you’re charging a fee) and shows how many tickets are left if 
you’ve limited the number of attendees. Additionally, you can 
use Eventbrite to e-mail potential attendees and promote your 
event through an integrated e-mail tool.
	
✓	Zvents.com is another free event-listing site, designed to be 
more of a calendar of events and less of an integrated event-
management site. If you’re hosting a promotional event to 
highlight your Kickstarter campaign, this is another opportu­
nity to get the word out and attract attendees. Again, all the 
events are searchable by neighborhood, date, and category.

 Chapter 10: Ten Resources to Help with Your Campaign 193
	
✓	You may know of Evite.com through birthday party or wed­
ding shower planning, but did you know you can use it also 
to create a virtual event relating to your Kickstarter deadline? 
Invite others to join your event and help you reach your goal. 
Figure 10-17 below shows a sample of the many Evite tem­
plates that are appropriate to fundraising.
