Introduction
A
lthough people view them with reverence and even awe, saints are 
simply ordinary men and women who, through their faith, overcome 
common weaknesses, failures, and shortcomings. And even though they’re 
often portrayed as perfect examples of holiness, saints are sinners, just like 
everyone else. Mother Teresa of Calcutta — likely to be made a saint some-
time soon — often said that the only difference between a saint and someone 
who isn’t a saint is that the saint never gives up. Perseverance is the key to 
sainthood.
Real saints are real people. They have real struggles, real temptations, and 
real problems. Those who are granted sainthood become role models for the 
rest of us, showing that holiness and sanctity aren’t for the few but are avail-
able to anyone and everyone. Saints are spiritual heroes who show us that 
if they can overcome their personal foibles, so can we. This book is about 
these real people who weren’t perfect but who never quit and never gave up 
trying to do and to be better.
About This Book
Everyone who’s in heaven is a saint, so there are far too many to count, let 
alone name in one book. This book doesn’t try to give an exhaustive list of 
every saint known to man; rather, it provides brief histories of the men and 
women who lived faith-filled lives worthy of admiration and emulation. We’re 
limited by the data that’s available, so most of the saints we examine here 
are those recognized by the Catholic Church, which has the oldest, most 
extensive resources on this topic. Other faith traditions — Greek or Russian 
Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and other churches — have holy men and 
women who are considered saints or considered to have lived saintly lives, 
but unlike the Catholic religion, those churches have no systematic and com-
plete documentation on them. It’s merely a matter of better record keeping, 
as well as the theology and doctrine of the Communion of Saints.
You don’t have to be Catholic to appreciate or to be interested in the lives 
of the saints. Human nature is the same, regardless of what creed one pro-
fesses. The stories of these brave men and women who fought temptation 
and persevered in their struggle to become better children of God are some-
thing anyone can appreciate.

Saints For Dummies 
In this book, we look at most of the popular saints and those whose existence 
has been verified. Saints who are missing from this book may very well exist 
and be in heaven, but some may have been only part of the imagination.
Part of the problem is that in the ancient church, there was no real, formal 
process by which one was named a saint. Some people were declared saints 
by unanimous consent, or acclamation, while others were named so by the 
local bishop or council of bishops. It wasn’t until the pope took the responsi-
bility for the process that beatification and canonization came to be properly 
documented.
We cover sainthood both before and after the formal process developed. 
Because of translation and historical inaccuracies, there may be variant 
spellings of certain saints’ names, or dates and places of birth and death. 
Remember, before and even well after the invention of the printing press, 
a lot of church records were completed by hand — without the luxury of 
spell check!
Conventions Used in This Book
Following are some conventions we use that you’ll want to keep in mind 
when reading this book:
 
✓ We use the traditional dating system of AD (anno domini, Latin for the 
“year of the Lord”) instead of the more recent usage of CE (common 
era), because of consistency. In the original records, the AD and BC 
(before Christ) designations of linear time are the only ones used. This 
convention isn’t meant to be insensitive to non-Christian readers but to 
be consistent with the setting in which the documents were made.
 
✓ The saints we look at in this book are those whose existence has been 
verified and documented. The abbreviation of the word “saint” is St. for 
the singular and SS. for the plural.
 
✓ Most saints of the early church, before the East-West Schism of 1054, are 
recognized by both Catholic and Orthodox Christians, while many of the 
post-Reformation (16th century) saints are typically only venerated by 
Catholics.
 
✓ We use italics for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that we 
define.
 
✓ When known, we list the saint’s town or country of origin on the first 
line below the saint’s name.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ If the dates of the person’s beatification and canonization are known, we 
include that information on the next two lines.
 
✓ We list patron information on the next line for those saints who are des-
ignated patrons of certain countries, occupations, or human conditions.
 
✓ Lastly, if the saint has a date on the Roman calendar (the liturgical cele-
brations for the Catholic Church around the world), we include that date 
on the next line before we look at his or her life in more detail.
What You’re Not to Read
This book is a reference book, so you don’t have to read everything. 
Sidebars — text enclosed in a shaded gray box — give you information 
that’s interesting but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the 
chapter or section topic. You can skip them if you’re pressed for time and 
still get the most important information. You can also skip any text marked 
by a Technical Stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book” later in this intro-
duction for more information).
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we made some assumptions about you, the reader:
 
✓ You aren’t yet a saint yourself — that is, you’re still among the living — 
but you want to know something about those men and women of faith 
who lived before you and who are honored for their holy lives.
 
✓ You may not be a Catholic Christian (you may be a Protestant or 
Evangelical Christian), but you’re curious about the lives of those par-
ticular men and women who are honored and venerated as being loyal 
friends and servants of God.
 
✓ You may be a Catholic who remembers reading or hearing about the 
lives of the saints, and you want to refresh your memory or clarify some 
details.
 
✓ You may have no religious affiliation but you have respect and admiration 
for the men and women who showed courage during trial, tribulation, suf-
fering, and persecution in defending their faith.
 
✓ You’re just curious and want to know the patron saint of your occupation 
or homeland, or you want to know more about those saintly people who 
overcame the same obstacles you’re battling each day.

How This Book Is Organized
This book comes in 7 parts, consisting of 22 chapters and 3 appendixes. 
Throughout the book, we refer you to other parts of the book to make it easy 
for you to get a better appreciation and understanding of a certain subject, 
but each part and chapter stands on its own, so you can read them in any 
order you like.
Part I: In the Beginning
In this part, we look at sainthood in general, the process involved, and how 
it’s applied specifically to certain individuals. We also examine the very first 
to be called saints — the apostles and disciples whom Jesus chose to start 
and to preach in his church.
The Catholic Church has the most saints because it’s the oldest religion ven-
erating the saints and is one of the few faith traditions to have an elaborate 
system to publicly declare someone a saint. This part looks at that proce-
dure, which has been streamlined by recent popes.
Part II: Put to the Test
Saints are holy men and women who more often than not had to endure 
many trials and tribulations. This part looks at those brave souls who over-
came their own personal weaknesses and temptations and never gave up in 
their struggle for sanctity.
We also look at those who battled religious persecution and opposition, not 
to mention prejudice and discrimination, because of their faith, as well as 
those who had to contend with the natural desire to marry and have children 
but who, for a higher love of God, embraced a celibate life of virginity and 
service to the Church. Finally, we look at those exceptional and rare saints 
who overcame even the ravages of time and whose dead bodies remain incor-
rupt (undecayed).
Part III: Living the Faith
From popes to pioneers, founding fathers to founding mothers, and noble 
kings to noble queens, this part looks at those pivotal saints who influenced 
and shaped Church history and Church life because of their position in the 
world or in the Church. These saints put their faith into practice and were 
instrumental in spreading and sustaining that same faith.

 Introduction
Part IV: Explaining the Faith
The learned wise men and women of this part are the saints whose love of 
truth and ability to defend and teach the faith preserved and promoted their 
beloved religion. Though not all held academic degrees, their titles of honor 
are based on the success they had explaining Christian theology.
Fathers, Doctors, and Pastors of the Church are looked at for their vital con-
tribution to the establishment of Christianity — not just as a religion but also 
as the means to sow the seeds of faith.
Part V: Living with the Saints
In this part, you meet some of the saints-to-be — those men and women cur-
rently beatified who are awaiting the final decree of canonization from the 
pope, whereby they become official saints of the Catholic Church.
We also examine things associated with saints, like their relics and shrines. 
Relics are either parts of the saint’s body or things that he or she owned, 
touched, wore, and so on. These artifacts are honored not for any magical 
reason but because that’s all that’s left of these holy men and women.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you like lists, the Part of Tens is for you. We give you ten of the most 
popular litanies and novenas of saints. We also give you ten places of saintly 
pilgrimage (shrines) and ten famous families of saints.
Part VII: Appendixes
Here we list the feast day for each saint as found on the current Roman cal-
endar (the Catholic Church liturgical observance), as well as a list of patron 
saints and their particular patronage (place, occupation, or condition).
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the fancy little pictures in the margins of this book. Here’s a guide 
to what they look like and signify:

6
Saints For Dummies 
 
This icon marks interesting information that makes it easier for you to get the 
inside scoop on saints and saintly facts.
 
This icon points out ideas that sum up and reinforce the concepts we discuss. 
In fact, if you’re short on time and can’t read an entire section, go straight to 
this icon. Also, if you need a refresher in a chapter for any reason, you can 
skim through and read these to reinforce the main points.
 
Think of this icon as bonus material — the info it flags gives you some back-
ground about the subject that’s not critical. In some cases, this information 
gives you the brief history of a point, or more detail than is absolutely neces-
sary. We think the information is interesting, so we include it — but if you’re in 
a time crunch, you can skip over it.
Where to Go from Here
You can start right in with Chapter 1 and read to the end, or you can use the 
table of contents and index to find just the bit of information you’re looking 
for. If you’re curious about the Apostles, turn to Chapter 3. For information 
on the Virgin Mary and the archangels, go to Chapter 2. Or, if you’re inter-
ested in people like Mother Teresa — people who’ve been beatified but aren’t 
yet official saints — check out Chapter 18.
The great thing about this book is that order doesn’t matter. In most chap-
ters, the saints are listed alphabetically (in a few chapters, chronological 
listing makes more sense, and we clarify that in each of the chapters), and 
the chapters are arranged by broad categories. You can read any chapter or 
any part of a chapter that interests you, or you can read the entire book from 
cover to cover.
For more in-depth study, we recommend Fr. Alban Butler’s Lives of the Saints 
in multi-volume and single-volume editions. He did a tremendous amount of 
research and study on almost every saint the Church recognizes.

Part I
In the Beginning

In this part . . .
W
e can’t really expect you to understand the saints 
until we explain what sainthood is and how it all 
comes together. In this part, we discuss the idea of saint-
hood, its qualities and characteristics, and the criteria the 
Church uses to determine whether someone is qualified 
to be named a saint. Anyone who makes it to heaven is a 
saint, but the true “official” saints are those of whom the 
Church has said: That man or woman lived a holy life 
worth imitating.
Saints are considered friends of God who were his faithful 
servants while alive on earth. This part looks at some of 
the first Christian saints of history — the Apostles and the 
Evangelists. We also include the most famous and beloved 
of all the saints, the Virgin Mary, and we briefly examine 
the mysterious spiritual beings who live with the saints in 
heaven — the angels.

I
n this chapter, we discuss the idea of sainthood in general, especially 
how the Catholic Church understands the notion of holiness in its mem-
bers. We take you through the canonization process and explain how it has 
evolved over the centuries. We explain how saints are venerated, and we dis-
cuss the unique role patron saints can play in your spiritual life. Finally, we 
examine the reasons for pursuing a saintly life and the means to achieve it.
Ordinary Saints versus Official Saints
In the Catholic Church, anyone who goes to heaven is considered a saint. 
Those who make it to heaven but are never canonized are still as saintly as 
those named so by the pope; in fact, the unnamed and unnumbered saints 
in heaven are in the majority, and God alone knows who they are and how 
numerous. These ordinary saints lived normal lives but did so with faith in 
and love for the Lord. Official saints, on the other hand, are men and women 
who lived lives worthy of recognition, honor, and imitation.
 
The Catholic Church has never taught that a person has to be perfect or 
sinless to get to heaven. In fact, it teaches that every man and woman who 
has been born since Adam and Eve (except for the Virgin Mary, by a special 
divine grace from God) suffers from the effects of original sin. This means 
that all of us are sinners and need forgiveness. The saints were all human, 
with their own vulnerabilities, but by the grace of God they were able to 
overcome their shortcomings. They lived holy lives, even with their quirks 

10
Part I: In the Beginning 
and weaknesses, proving that others can do it, too. To be named a saint 
(a decision reserved for the pope), candidates are canonized, or formally 
authenticated through an intense study of the person’s life. Everything 
that’s known about a candidate — his words, deeds, and writings — comes 
under close scrutiny. If the details of the candidate’s life are determined 
worthy of formal sainthood, the facts and evidence are presented to the 
pope for approval. No one becomes a saint until the pope says it’s so.
 
Official sainthood isn’t merely an honor for the saints themselves. The saints 
serve as examples for the faithful who struggle to reconcile their human 
natures with their spiritual aspirations.
The following sections explore the making of a saint, from the initial nomina-
tion process and early examinations, to everything the Church must consider 
and the events that must take place after the candidate’s death.
The Canonization Process Then and Now
As we mention in the previous section, any declaration of sainthood must 
come from the pope. That’s true now, but it wasn’t always so. Before the 
12th century, the local bishop was the one who canonized saints — either on 
his own or in a council or synod of bishops. In very early and ancient times, 
saints were declared by acclamation, or unanimous consent of the people. If a 
popular holy person died, usually a martyr, the diocese where he or she lived 
and died eagerly pushed for sainthood.
 
But dying for the faith wasn’t the only way of sanctity and holiness. Living 
a good and holy life — even if it didn’t end in martyrdom — meant some-
thing, too.
The question arose, then: Who gets to be declared a saint? In this section, we 
look at the development of the formal process by which someone is declared 
(canonized) a saint.
Centralizing the process 
with Pope Alexander III
Pope Alexander III was the first to rein in the canonization process. In the late 
12th century, he made canonization the exclusive province of the papacy, 
and he and his successors established elaborate processes and regulations 
to make sure that every candidate met uniform eligibility guidelines. The 

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Sainthood
result was something very much like a trial. Each investigation involved a 
promoter for the saint-to-be (sort of a defense attorney) and an opposing side 
(the equivalent of a prosecuting attorney), called the devil’s advocate, whose 
job was to expose any heresies in the candidate’s writings or sermons, and/
or any immoral behavior in the candidate’s life.
For the next 800 years, those who wanted to advocate a particular person 
for sainthood had to follow a time-consuming path. First was beatification, a 
formal decision that a person can be called “Blessed.” Beatification involved 
a canonical trial with advocates and judges. Those who knew the candidate 
or witnessed postmortem miracles testified, and the candidate’s writings and 
teachings were examined and entered into evidence. All this took place in 
Rome, because one of the regulations that came from Alexander’s centraliza-
tion policies was that all such trials be held at the Vatican.
Oh, yes, there was also a 50-year waiting period between a person’s death 
and the earliest date he or she could be considered for sainthood. The pur-
pose of the waiting period was to allow time for emotions to settle, thus 
reducing the number of grief-induced petitions for sainthood. Fifty years was 
considered the length of time for one generation to disappear.
Revamping the process 
with Pope John Paul II
In 1983, Pope John Paul II made major changes to the canonization process. 
For one thing, he reduced the waiting period from 50 years to 5 years, in large 
part because, after 50 years, finding witnesses who knew the candidate per-
sonally can be difficult.
 
The pope has the authority to reduce or waive this waiting period; in fact, 
John Paul waived it himself in the case of Mother Teresa (see Chapter 18).
John Paul II also replaced the trial process with a more scholarly, document-
oriented approach. Officials still gather the candidate’s writings and facts 
about the candidate’s life, but the contentious roles of the devil’s advocate 
and the trial setting are gone (see the upcoming section “Examining lives and 
allowing for human nature”). And he returned much of the process to the 
authority of the local diocese; local bishops and dioceses now do much of 
the preparatory work and the first phase of research, as they’re the ones on 
location where the proposed saint lived and worked.
When a bishop accepts a case for review, the candidate is called a “Servant 
of God,” until a decision is made to send the case on. When that occurs, the 
proposed saint is considered Venerable, and research focuses on proof of a 

12
Part I: In the Beginning 
miracle connected with the candidate (see the “Confirming miracles” section 
later in this chapter). After a bona fide miracle is established, Rome decides 
whether the person can be called “Blessed” and formally beatified.
The next phase is one of waiting for another miracle and the documentation 
on it. Not all beatifications continue to canonization, but as long as a verifi-
able second miracle exists, there is hope.
 
Pope John Paul II reserved all beatification ceremonies to himself, but Pope 
Benedict XVI has restored the ancient practice of allowing other bishops to 
beatify their local candidates for sainthood. Benedict still has final say on ele-
vating a “Blessed” to “Saint.”
 
If sufficient evidence exists, and if the pope decides to canonize someone, the 
feast day is typically the day he or she died. This is considered the saint’s 
“heavenly birthday.” Some saints die on a day already taken in the universal 
calendar, so their feast day is designated on the closest open day to their 
actual date of death.
Examining lives and allowing for human nature
When people are proposed as possible saints, their lives — their actions 
and words — are closely examined. No one looks for perfection — just for 
re assurance that the person in question didn’t lead a notorious or scandal-
ous life. Catholic authorities scrutinize the candidate’s speeches, sermons, 
books, and other writings to make sure that they contain nothing contradicting 
defined doctrines or dogmas.
Still saints, just no feast days
Some saints, like St. Christopher and St. 
Valentine, have been removed from the Roman 
calendar, but that doesn’t mean that they were 
defrocked of their sainthood. Saints for whom 
there isn’t enough evidence to establish the 
date and place of death are considered saints, 
but their traditional feast days may be given 
officially to someone whose departure from this 
world can be verified.
So, for example, February 14 was traditionally 
St. Valentine’s Day and still is. However, there 
are no records unequivocally establishing the 
actual day of his death, and even the precise 
year is unknown. (We don’t even know what 
century some saints lived in.) On the other hand, 
we have proof that SS. Cyril and Methodius died 
on February 14. So Valentine’s Day is the official 
feast day for St. Cyril and St. Methodius.
What happened to St. Valentine and St. 
Christopher? They’re still in heaven; they’re just 
not on the liturgical calendar, that’s all. Other 
saints went from the universal calendar to the 
local or regional feast calendar.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Sainthood
If the candidate’s words and deeds pass muster, examiners then search for 
heroic virtue — the desire and effort to seriously pursue a life of holiness.
 
Saints are human, and as such, they make mistakes. They’re not angels, they 
don’t have wings or halos, and they don’t glow in the dark. Saints are simply 
sinners who never gave up trying to do and to be better.
Confirming miracles
The definition of an accepted miracle varies almost as widely as those pro-
posed for sainthood. Traditional miracles involve unexpected healing that’s 
immediate and complete, as well as inexplicable to modern science.
 
Other miracles can be used as corroborative evidence, such as
 
✓ Incorruptibility: A phenomenon in which the dead person’s body doesn’t 
decay, no matter how many years have elapsed since death. Only non-
embalmed bodies are considered for evidence of incorruptibility.
 
✓ The odor of sanctity: A sweet smell of roses exuding from the dead 
body, despite rigor mortis and the number of years since death. Again, 
only non-embalmed bodies are considered for this miracle.
 
✓ Signs of stigmata: Marks resembling one or more of the five wounds 
Christ suffered upon crucifixion, present only while the person was alive.
 
✓ Bilocation: Being in two places at the same time. Because this only 
happens before death, while the saint candidate is still alive, only the 
most reliable testimony from unimpeachable witnesses can be used. 
Levitation also can be used as evidence.
Intercession (Patron Saints)
You have mediators and intercessors in your lives every day; you just don’t 
call them “mediator” and “intercessor.” Sometimes you call them “doctor” 
and “nurse,” or “store manager” and “clerk.” The intercessor is the person 
you turn to in order to seek help from someone higher up: The nurse relays 
your information to the doctor; the clerk relays requests or concerns to the 
store manager.
That’s how it is with God and saints. Jesus is the mediator in our lives, the 
one who can speak on behalf of an entire group and who has the authority 
to negotiate, make agreements or treaties, and represent both parties. The 

14
Part I: In the Beginning 
saints are those who make requests to the one and only mediator on behalf 
of someone else. Their role is optional — not everyone turns to an interces-
sor, or saint, to address God.
Patron saints serve as intercessors for particular areas. For example, St. 
Lucy was a martyr in the ancient Church who died a horrible death when her 
Roman persecutors gouged out her eyeballs (see Chapter 6). She is invoked 
as the patron saint for ailments of the eye.
 
Just as the living on earth can and do pray for others (intercession), the saints 
in heaven can and do pray for the living here on earth. In both cases, the inter-
cessor prays to the one mediator on behalf of someone else. The Catholic 
Church sees the intercession of the saints as one big prayer chain in the sky.
Venerating the Saints
Just because saints have their own days on the Church calendar doesn’t 
mean they’re to be worshipped — that’s held for God alone. Rather, saints 
are worthy of public honor or veneration, called dulia in Latin. Holy men and 
women in heaven deserve honor just as our nation honors those who died 
defending our country.
 
Statues, icons, and images of the saints are not to be considered idols (a claim 
some have used to criticize Catholicism, citing one of the Ten Commandments 
warning against worshipping false idols). Again, the proper analogy is not wor-
ship but honor. Memorials such as statues of George Washington, Thomas 
Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln are public and government-supported ways to 
honor brave heroes who either died in service of their nation or who spent a 
good portion of their lives in service to it. The same type of honor exists 
within the Church. Statues, icons, and images of the saints are memorials 
meant to remind us of the courage and piety of these holy men and women.
Do you have a picture of a deceased loved one in your wallet or hanging on 
the wall at home? Those images aren’t idols. The pictures of saints displayed 
in church or in homes are the same thing: a visible reminder of someone you 
honor and appreciate.
 
Canonized saints not only have a feast day but also can have churches named 
after them, such as St. Bernadette’s Church or the Church of St. Ann. The 
building is still a house of God and place of divine worship, yet the place is 
dedicated to the intercession (see the next section) of this particular saint. 
Schools (elementary, high school, college, and university), too, can be named 
after canonized saints to honor their legacy of faith.

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Sainthood
Following the Saints’ Examples
By canonizing many new saints, Pope John Paul showed the world that 
sanctity and holiness don’t belong to a clerical minority. Heaven is open to 
anyone who wants it and is willing to live a good and holy life.
 
Sainthood is a multi-step process, both in life and after death. In life, 
achieving holiness may involve a one-time decision to accept God, but that 
decision must be followed by a lifetime of living according to that decision. 
Martyrdom — dying in the name of faith — is a one-time act, but making 
such a strong commitment requires a lifetime of working toward being a 
true and faithful servant of God.
Sainthood is a reminder that perseverance and dedication to one’s faith can 
bring us to our goals. As Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta often said, “God 
does not call us to be successful; he calls us to be faithful.” We know we 
aren’t perfect and, save for the grace of God, won’t be; as such, we should 
stop trying to reach for that which is out of our grasp. Instead of trying to be 
perfect, we are called to be faithful in our efforts to do and be better.
Sainthood is also a reminder that even the most hardened sinner isn’t with-
out help or hope. Through God’s grace, anyone can turn his life around and 
return to the faithful.
In this section, we look at the moral, everyday life of the hopeful saint-to-be. 
Because the saints are normal human beings, they have the same wounded 
human nature all men and women are born with, thanks to original sin. And 
because they have the same moral weaknesses we all do, their ability to over-
come them by God’s grace is also available to everyone else.
Setting a moral and ethical foundation 
with the four cardinal virtues
St. Thomas Aquinas, a brilliant theologian of the 13th century, taught that 
“grace builds upon nature.” This means that before anyone can hope to live 
a holy life worthy of sainthood (being in heaven), he or she must have a solid 
moral and ethical foundation upon which the life of grace is built. Being a 
holy or saintly person is no accident. You must intend and want to be holy. 
One must first pursue goodness before holiness. The former lays the ground-
work for the latter.
The moral or cardinal virtues have been known and discussed since antiq-
uity. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and the Stoics, just to name a few, 
were philosophers who lived centuries before Christ and who were Greek or 

16
Part I: In the Beginning 
Roman pagans. They had no revealed religion like the Jews and Christians. 
But they had the use of human reason and saw that there were four cardinal 
(from the Latin word cardo, meaning “hinge” — that is, the hinges to a good 
moral life) virtues. The ancient philosophers realized that prudence, jus-
tice, fortitude, and temperance were the underpinnings of an ethical life and 
would bring peace and happiness to the individual person and to the com-
munity and society at large. Faith complements reason, so religion continues 
the process by adding to the cardinal or moral virtues the three theological 
virtues of faith, hope, and love.
The moral (cardinal) virtues can and ought to be practiced by anyone and 
everyone. They’re good for you and help you to be and to do good, as each 
one is considered a habit you must acquire through effort and practice. The 
theological virtues come via divine grace through the sacraments, especially 
Baptism, which is the gateway to the other sacraments (Penance, Eucharist, 
Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick).
 
To be considered holy, one must first seek a life of virtue — a life guided by 
the four cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. As 
with any life change, each of these virtues must be practiced often before it 
becomes an ingrained habit.
The following sections give a closer look at each of the cardinal virtues.
Prudence
The premiere of all virtues, prudence is the ability to make good decisions 
and to have the ability to practice tact — knowing when, where, and how 
something is appropriate. You wouldn’t ask a friend to repay a debt at the 
friend’s mother’s funeral. In the same vein, prudence is knowing how to 
approach a delicate situation with sensitivity and charity.
St. Thomas More (16th century) was a most prudent man. As Lord Chancellor 
of England and a wealthy nobleman, Thomas always weighed his words 
and deeds before he said or did them. Some may have called him cautious, 
but prudent best summarizes his life as a Catholic layman. During his con-
flict with King Henry VIII, Thomas prudently kept quiet when needed and 
spoke eloquently and boldly when needed as well. Never rash or impetuous, 
Thomas prayed and gave deliberation to every aspect of his political, social, 
and private life. Being wise in knowing the right time and place and the right 
word and action is what prudence is about.
Justice
Justice is doing the right thing for the right reason; quid pro quo (this for 
that), the Romans used to say. There are three kinds of justice: commutative, 
distributive, and social, each defined by the people involved.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Sainthood
 
✓ Commutative justice involves just two parties: the buyer and seller, 
teacher and student, neighbor and neighbor. It involves equity and fair-
ness between the two parties.
 
✓ Distributive justice is the balance between the individual and the group, 
such as between a resident and a government, or a union member and 
the union. A resident pays taxes and votes in elections; in return, the 
government provides for safety and well-being.
 
✓ Social justice is the responsibility everyone has to preserve natural 
resources for future generations and look out for one another. When 
one government oppresses its people, for example, social justice drives 
other governments and citizens to stand up in defense of the oppressed.
St. Joseph (first century) is literally called a “just” man in the Gospel, and he 
epitomizes the virtue of justice. He knew what was the right thing to do, and 
he sought to be fair at all times. His protection of his wife Mary and her son 
Jesus was motivated out of love, to be sure, but it was his practice of justice 
that enabled him to be the husband and foster father he needed to be for his 
family. Being fair to everyone and doing the right thing — and not for reward 
or recognition — is what justice is all about.
Fortitude
Everyone has been in the position of wanting or needing to do or say some-
thing that’s necessary, although not easy. Fortitude is having the courage to 
do or say it anyway.
Blessed Teresa of Calcutta (20th century) is certainly the poster child for 
fortitude and courage. She was unflinching in her determination to do what 
had to be done and to say what had to be said, no matter how powerful her 
opponents. Whether it was helping the poorest of the poor or defending the 
lives of the unborn in the womb, this little Albanian nun became very familiar 
with the virtue of fortitude, and hence, she never gave up and never quit. She 
spoke with charity and kindness but also with firmness of conviction — to 
leaders of the First, Second, and Third Worlds; the UN; Congress and the 
White House. Having the guts to do the job (God’s will, that is) and not be 
influenced by ambition or fear is what fortitude is about.
Temperance
Temperance is knowing when enough is enough. Temperate people set limits 
on their own legitimate pleasures and activities. You may allow yourself a 
glass of wine, for example, but temperance keeps you from overindulging.
St. Josemaria Escriva (20th century) was a very temperate man. He practiced 
moderation in his work and in his play (leisure and recreation). No party 
pooper, Josemaria would enjoy parties and responsibly partake of alcoholic 
beverages, such as wine. But he knew there had to be limits, and he didn’t 

18
Part I: In the Beginning 
overindulge. He balanced work with rest. Temperance taught him the value of 
moderation in pleasures so as not to abuse himself or others. Josemaria also 
practiced some self-denial called mortification, but again in moderate ways so 
as not to incur injury or harm. A healthy balance is what temperance is about.
Building on moral virtues with 
the theological virtues
The road to sainthood involves not only the moral virtues but also the theo-
logical virtues. These virtues are bestowed at Baptism but can be enhanced 
throughout one’s lifetime. Baptism remits original sin and makes a person an 
adopted “child of God.” Sanctifying grace is given at Baptism, which makes 
a person holy and thus able to enter the holiness of heaven. Along with 
sanctifying grace, Baptism also makes the soul pliable and ready for actual 
grace, which is the supernatural gift from God that enables you to do holy 
things (like pray, forgive your enemies, endure hardships, make sacrifices for 
others, have courage in the midst of difficulties, and so on).
 
Following are the theological virtues:
 
✓ Faith is believing what God says simply because it comes from God.
 
✓ Hope is trusting in promises that God has yet to fulfill, knowing that 
those promises one day will come to fruition, at a time and place that is 
right for God.
 
✓ Love, theologically, is a spiritual love, wanting what is best for someone 
else, putting others above one’s self. It’s not a sexual love or a biological 
love; it’s seeking to love God and to love your neighbor.
The theological virtues build on what the moral, cardinal virtues hopefully 
establish as a foundation. Faith, hope, and love empower you to believe what 
God has revealed, to trust in his mercy and providence, to love God with 
your whole heart and soul, and to love your neighbor as yourself. The daily 
struggle to live a holy life is made possible by the theological virtues. Hence, 
people want and need more faith, more hope, and more love every day of 
their lives until they finally get to heaven, where there is the fullness of grace 
and the total joy without end.
 
Sainthood begins with virtue and ends in holiness. It’s a lifelong process — 
there’s never a time when a person can stop being prudent, just, temperate, or 
courageous. In the same way, faith, hope, and love are never fully realized 
until we get to heaven, but God gives us little morsels to savor along the way.

Chapter 2
Angels and the Blessed Virgin
In This Chapter
▶ Distinguishing angels from saints
▶ Looking at the three key archangels
▶ Getting to know the Virgin Mary
S
aints are human souls living in heaven. They’re considered friends of 
God and deserve respect and honor because of their fidelity. Of all the 
saints in heaven, the highest honor is given to the Virgin Mary, the Mother of 
Jesus Christ. She’s not only the biological Mother of the Savior but also his 
most faithful disciple. Mary always put the will of God before her own, and 
she even says in the Gospel of John, “Do whatever [my son] tells you.”
As saints warrant honor and veneration (but never adoration or worship), 
Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox Church give the Blessed Mother the 
highest type of honor, though they stop short of crossing the line into adora-
tion (because worshiping Mary would be idolatry). She is given the utmost 
respect because of her special relationship with Jesus.
The angels are second only to Mary in terms of their dignity. Both are crea-
tures made by God. Though angels are far superior to human beings in terms 
of intelligence and power, the Virgin Mary outranks them because of her 
unique position as the Mother of Christ.
Three angelic beings are named in the Bible and a few more in the apocry-
phal Scriptures. In this chapter, we examine them and the special woman 
chosen to be the Mother of the Messiah, the Virgin Mary.

20
Part I: In the Beginning 
Understanding Angels (And Why Some 
Angels Are Considered Saints)
Contrary to popular belief, angels aren’t people who’ve died and gone to 
heaven and then earned their wings. Angels are spirits that God created before 
he made human beings; they were the first creatures ever created and were 
the most powerful, most intelligent, and most beautiful. Angels are pure spirits 
in that they have no bodies — only intellect and will. Men and women — from 
Adam and Eve to today — are body and soul, both material and spiritual.
 
People who die and go to heaven don’t become angels — they become saints. 
Angels and saints are two separate beings, separate species. Confusion arises 
when, on occasion, some angels are given the title saint, which is typically 
reserved for humans. The overlap is merely a matter of semantics: The Latin 
word for saint is sancta, which means holy. Once in heaven — saint or angel — 
one is automatically holy.
It can be confusing, but look at it this way: Angels are spirits in heaven, and 
saints are human beings in heaven. Angels can be called “saint” (as in the 
case of St. Michael the Archangel) as a sign of respect and honor. A human 
being is called “saint” only after death and once in heaven.
Christianity believes that angels and demons (fallen angels) are separated 
according to their loyalty and obedience to God. The first angels were tested on 
their loyalty and obedience, and those who failed, like Lucifer, were cast into 
hell. In hell, the angels became demons with Lucifer (whose name means bearer 
of light), who later became known as the devil (also called the prince of darkness).
Kicked out of heaven?
Many talk about the devil and his fellow fallen 
angels being kicked out of heaven and thrown 
into hell by St. Michael the Archangel, but that 
theory goes against the Christian belief, “Once 
in heaven, always in heaven.” The Bible speaks 
about a war in heaven (Revelation 12:7) where 
St. Michael defeats the dragon and one-third 
of the angels fall with him (Revelation 12:4), but 
this book of the Bible is apocalyptic, meaning 
that the sacred author used lots of allegory and 
metaphor in writing it.
Theologians explain that the angels were cre-
ated and tested before they entered heaven, 
because entry into the kingdom was the reward 
for passing the test. After you’re inside heaven, 
you can’t leave because you can’t be tempted. 
Heaven is seeing God face to face, and after 
you see pure truth and experience pure love 
and goodness, you want nothing else. Outside 
of heaven, however, angels and men can be 
tempted. Therefore, just as Adam and Eve 
were tested in the Garden of Eden (but not yet 
in heaven), so, too, the angels were somehow 
tested and the good ones (about two-thirds) 
were allowed into heaven, while the bad ones 
who failed were cast into hell.

21
 Chapter 2: Angels and the Blessed Virgin
 
The Bible names only three specific angels — Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. 
Apocryphal books (texts that aren’t considered authoritative on Sacred 
Scripture) mention others, such as Uriel and Ramiel. Because these others 
aren’t named in the canonical books of the Bible, their identities aren’t consid-
ered reliable or above reproach. The three biblical archangels are treated as 
true angelic beings.
Scholars have speculated for centuries on the number of angels. St. Thomas 
Aquinas — often called the angelic doctor (see Chapter 13) — believed that 
the precise number of angels was beyond human comprehension. Some 
things, however, are known, such as the fact that angels are separated into 
nine subdivisions, or choirs.
 
The nine subdivisions, from greatest to least, are
 
✓ Seraphim
 
✓ Cherubim
 
✓ Thrones
 
✓ Dominions
 
✓ Virtues
 
✓ Powers
 
✓ Principalities
 
✓ Archangels
 
✓ Angels
St. Michael the Archangel
Patron: police officers, the military
Feast day: September 29
Michael means “who is like God?” — a fitting name for one whose mission 
is to battle the egos of others and remind them that no one is like God. St. 
Michael is the only angel mentioned in both the Old Testament (Hebrew 
Scriptures) and New Testament. Daniel 10:13, 21 describes him as the prince 
of the angels and a protector of Israel. The Epistle of Jude and the Book of 
Revelation also mention Michael as the one who victoriously battles the 
devil. He is invoked anytime there is suspicion of demonic or diabolical activ-
ity. The prayer to St. Michael is used on such occasions and also was prayed 
after every Mass in the Catholic rite from 1886 (by Pope Leo XIII) to 1964, 
when Pope Paul VI dropped it. The prayer to St. Michael is:

22
Part I: In the Beginning 
St. Michael, Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the 
wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. 
And do thou, prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into 
hell Satan and all the other evil spirits who prowl about the world for the 
ruin of souls. Amen.
St. Michael is typically depicted in military armor (see Figure 2-1), thrust-
ing a sword or spear into a dragon. The Sanctuary of Monte Sant’Angelo sul 
Gargano in Apulia, Italy, is the oldest shrine in Western Europe dedicated 
to St. Michael. Pious tradition holds that the archangel appeared there four 
times in a 1,000-year period. Pilgrims of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina often visit, 
as St. Pio had a strong devotion to the place and to St. Michael. Also, St. Joan 
of Arc had visions of St. Michael (accompanied by St. Catherine of Alexandria 
and St. Margaret) in the 15th century.

Although he’s called archangel, St. Michael is most likely a member of the sera-
phim, the highest rank of angels, whose mission is to praise God day and 
night. Any angel above the rank angel can be called archangel out of respect.
St. Gabriel the Archangel
Patron: messengers, journalists, and communications
Feast day: September 29

23
 Chapter 2: Angels and the Blessed Virgin
St. Gabriel is probably most widely recognized as the angel who comes to Mary 
and tells her she’s carrying the Christ child. He also appears to Zachariah to 
inform him that his wife Elizabeth — the Virgin Mary’s cousin — will give birth 
to a son, John (the Baptist).
The name Gabriel means strength of God. Images of St. Gabriel often depict him 
with a herald’s trumpet, as he was the divine messenger to the Virgin Mary.
St. Raphael the Archangel
Patron: travelers
Feast day: September 29
Raphael means healing of God. This angel appears in the Book of Tobit, where 
he is sent by God to help three people: Tobit, his son Tobiah, and his future 
daughter-in-law Sarah. Sarah had been cursed by the demon Asmodeus so 
that her husband died on their wedding night before they consummated the 
marriage, leaving her without offspring.
Widows without children were considered the most desperate and pathetic 
of society, because in ancient times, women literally depended on their hus-
bands and sons to care for and protect them. Without either husband or chil-
dren, a widow was as vulnerable as an orphan. For Sarah, the situation was 
even more tragic: Before she married Tobiah, she had had seven previous 
husbands, and all of them died on their wedding night.
Tobit, a wealthy and devout Jew, lived among the captives being deported to 
Nineveh from the northern kingdom of Israel in 721 BC. According to Jewish 
tradition, Jews are required to bury their dead, especially the Hebrew victims 
of King Sennacherib of Assyria. The burial rite was against the law, however, 
as Hebrew captives had no civil rights whatsoever.
One night, after burying a fellow Israelite, Tobit slept outside his bedroom 
and was blinded by droppings left by birds. In those times, blindness was as 
much a tragedy as being a widow or orphan. Raphael was sent to help restore 
sight to Tobit, to end the curse of Sarah, and to unite Sarah and Tobiah as 
husband and wife. During his visit, he appeared in human form, and only 
when he was about to return to heaven did Raphael reveal his true identity. 
Because of his time accompanying young Tobiah on a journey, St. Raphael is 
invoked as the patron of travelers, especially those on a pilgrimage.

24
Part I: In the Beginning 
 
Tobit is one of the seven books of the Old Testament that are in the Catholic 
and Eastern Orthodox Bibles but are missing in the Protestant Bibles, or 
sometimes placed at the back of the book in a section called Apocrypha 
(other writings). Catholicism calls these books deuterocanonical, which 
means from a second (deutero in Greek) canon (authorized list). The first 39 
books are from the first canon and were written originally in Hebrew before 
the Babylonian Captivity (586 BC), when two-thirds of the Jews were exiled 
from the southern kingdom of Judah. (The northern kingdom of Israel had 
been conquered by Assyria in 720 BC.) The seven books of the Deuterocanon 
(or Apocrypha in Protestant theology) are Baruch, Maccabees I and II, Tobit, 
Judith, Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), and Wisdom. They were written in Greek 
during the captivity and were included in the Septuagint (the first Greek 
translation of the entire Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament), written in 
250–150 BC.
The Blessed Virgin Mary
As the Mother of the Son of God, the Virgin Mary is the highest of all saints 
and deserving of the highest praise possible.
 
None of the saints can be worshiped — that’s an honor reserved for God alone. 
Theologians call the honor given to saints dulia to distinguish it from latria, 
the worship of God. The honor given to Mary is called hyperdulia because it’s 
the highest form allowed and required.
Knowing other angels
While Catholicism only publicly acknowl-
edges St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and St. Raphael, 
Eastern Orthodox Christians (like the Russian 
Orthodox and Greek Orthodox churches) also 
recognize the following angels:
 ✓ Uriel, whose name means Fire of God (III 
Esdras 3:1, 5:20)
 ✓ Shealtiel, whose name means Intercessor 
of God (III Esdras 5:16)
 ✓ Jehudiel, whose name means Glorifier 
of God
 ✓ Barachiel, whose name means Blessing 
of God
 ✓ Jeremiel, whose name means God’s exalta-
tion (III Ezra 4:36)

25
 Chapter 2: Angels and the Blessed Virgin
Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus
The story of Mary is one of the most repeated stories of the Bible. She had 
been engaged to be married to Joseph of Nazareth for some time as a young 
girl. Before the wedding, however, the angel Gabriel appeared to her and 
announced that she was to give birth to the Messiah (Hebrew word for anointed 
one), also called the Christ (from the Greek word for anointed one, Kristos).
Mary, a virgin and engaged to be married, was confused — how could she 
become the Mother of the Savior? Gabriel tells her that through the power 
of the Holy Spirit, she’ll become pregnant with Jesus without the biological 
cooperation of any human male. It will literally be a virgin birth. This miracu-
lous beginning of Jesus is foretold in the Old Testament prophecy of Isaiah 
7:14 that a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.
Joseph, knowing he isn’t the biological father but initially ignorant of the 
divine origin of Mary’s pregnancy, plans to divorce her quietly. Gabriel then 
appears to him in a dream and tells him that Mary has indeed been faithful 
but is with child by the power of the Holy Spirit. Joseph awakes and takes 
Mary into his home. When she is about to give birth, the Roman Emperor 
Caesar Augustus issues a decree for a universal census, making Mary and 
Joseph travel to their ancestral hometown of Bethlehem, where her baby, 
Jesus, is born.
Beatified or canonized?
The Virgin Mary is called the Blessed Virgin 
Mary or the Blessed Mother, yet she’s consid-
ered queen of all the saints. Deceased people 
get the title Blessed when they’re officially 
beatified, and the last step is to be formally 
canonized, at which time the title Saint pre-
cedes their proper name. Does this mean that 
Jesus’s mother is only beatified and not yet a 
saint? No. The title Blessed in Mary’s case is 
unique because of what is said in the Gospel 
of St. Luke, when Mary says, “All generations 
shall call me ‘blessed’” (1:48), just as St. Bede 
of England is still referred to as Venerable 
Bede. He has been beatified and canonized, so 
he is a saint, but people became accustomed 
to always calling him Venerable Bede, and so 
the name stuck. Likewise, to differentiate Mary 
from the other saints, outside the Anglican use 
of St. Mary, Catholicism normally refers to her 
as Blessed Virgin Mary, or BVM for short. So, 
no need to worry that Our Lady got busted down 
a rank or something like that.

26
Part I: In the Beginning 
The family is forced to flee to Egypt after Jesus’s birth, when King Herod 
tries to kill the baby Jesus in an attempt to thwart the prophecy. Herod 
orders all firstborn males age 2 and under to be slaughtered; Jesus only 
escaped because his mother and her husband hid in Egypt until the death 
of their enemy.
Back in Nazareth, Mary and Joseph raised Jesus in a normal home setting, 
and Jesus became known as a carpenter’s son. (See Figure 2-2 for a depiction 
of the Holy Family.) Jesus lived with Mary and Joseph for 30 years before he 
began his public ministry. That ministry continued for three years until his 
Crucifixion, death, and Resurrection in AD 33.

Other key references to Mary in the Bible
Mary is mentioned in the Gospel in the beginning of Jesus’s life, from his 
conception at the Annunciation (when Gabriel tells Mary she’s to become the 
mother of the Messiah) to the Nativity (Christmas Day, when Jesus is born) 
of Christ, and also at other key moments.
Meeting the Magi
Shortly after Jesus’s birth and before the family flees into Egypt, Mary 
encounters the Magi, or three wise men, who bring gifts to the Christ child 
(this event is called the Epiphany). One brings a gift of gold, to represent 
the kingship of Christ; one brings frankincense, to represent the divinity 
of Christ; and the third brings myrrh, to represent the human mortality of 
Christ (Matthew 2:1–11).

 Chapter 2: Angels and the Blessed Virgin
Seeing the future
On the eighth day after his birth, Jesus was to be circumcised according to 
Mosaic law, and Mary and Joseph take the child to the Temple in Jerusalem, 
where he is also presented for a blessing. While there, the family meets 
Simeon, an old holy man who has been promised by God that he won’t die 
until his eyes see the Messiah. Simeon prophesies that Mary will be pierced 
by a sword of sorrow as her son will be the rise and fall of many in Israel 
(Luke 2:22–35). After Jesus’s death on the cross on Good Friday, a Roman 
soldier thrusts a spear into his heart, whereupon blood and water flow out. 
Mary’s maternal heart also must have been wounded, emotionally speaking, 
as she helplessly watches the horrible ordeal her only son endures for our 
salvation (John 19:34).
Fearing for a lost child
When Jesus was 12 years old he was thought to be missing for three days 
(Luke 2:41–52) during the Feast of Passover. It’s a mother’s nightmare: Your 
only child is gone, and you have no idea where he is. Mary and Joseph look 
frantically for three days after leaving Jerusalem, only to find Jesus among 
the religious teachers, not only listening to them but teaching them, as well. 
Confronting the adolescent Savior, Mary asks Jesus why he put his parents 
through all this anxiety and worry. Jesus replies, “Why were you looking for 
me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” Like the proph-
ecy of Simeon and the gifts of the Magi, Christ’s response to his mother 
stays with Mary, as Scripture says she “pondered these things in her heart” 
(Luke 2:51).
After the incident in the Temple, the Bible says nothing more of Jesus until 
he turned 30 and began his public ministry. Most likely, Jesus lived with his 
mom and worked in the carpenter’s shop with Joseph, because in several 
places in the Bible, he’s called not only the carpenter’s son but also a carpen-
ter himself.
Jesus’s first miracle
Jesus’s first miracle came at the request of his mother. Jesus was in the 
early days of his ministry after 40 days of fasting and praying in the desert. 
Mary comes to him as an intercessor for the Church, seeking his mediation. 
Jesus is the one and only mediator between God and man because he is both 
human and divine (see Chapter 1 for more on intercessors and mediators).
Mary and Jesus attend a wedding reception, and Mary notices that the wine 
has run out. Weddings then were much like weddings today: As long as the 
food and wine kept coming, the guests were happy. When either ran out, the 
guests left. So Mary tells Jesus the situation (“they have no more wine”) in 
John 2:3, and he replies mysteriously: “Woman, what does this have to do 
with me?” (John 2:4).

28
Part I: In the Beginning 
If the story ended there, it would be logical to conclude that Jesus rebuked 
his mother. When looked at more closely and in context, it’s a totally 
different matter. The original Greek text of John’s Gospel says: gynai, ti emoi 
kai soi, which literally translates to “woman, what [is] to me [is] to you,” 
and the Latin of St. Jerome’s Vulgate is the same (quid mihi et tibi est mulier). 
Immediately after he responds to his mother, she tells the waiters, “Do 
whatever he tells you.” Then Jesus orders them to take six stone water jars 
(each holding 20 to 30 gallons), fill them to the brim with water, and then 
pour some to the wine steward. What he tastes is not water, but the best 
wine he’s ever had.
Standing at the foot of the cross
After all his disciples abandon him during his Crucifixion and death at 
Calvary, save for St. John the Evangelist, Jesus’s mother, the Virgin Mary, 
stands at the foot of the cross. Her presence gives him comfort, but at 
the same time, it’s a cause of great suffering. It’s a comfort because, in his 
sacred humanity, Jesus has the same human love any son would have for his 
mother. He also sees that his pain and suffering cause her emotional pain and 
suffering. What son wants to see his own mother in such agony? Yet it’s his 
physical agony that causes her emotional agony. Knowing that his death is 
weighing heavily on his mother, Jesus gives his only possession not stolen 
from him by his persecutors: his mother. He gives her to St. John when he 
says, “behold, your mother” (John 19:27).
Silent according to Scripture, Mary says nothing — just remains a disciple 
with Jesus to the very end. After his death, she takes his lifeless body when 
it comes off the cross and holds it lovingly in her arms (as depicted in 
Michelangelo’s Pieta).
Mary’s final appearance in the Bible takes place at Pentecost, 50 days after 
Jesus’s Resurrection on Easter Sunday. The Acts of the Apostles tells us that 
Mary was present in the same Upper Room that Christ had used before on 
Holy Thursday, when he celebrated the Last Supper with his 12 Apostles. 
Now, each of those same men, along with the Mother of Jesus, will experience 
the coming of the Holy Spirit upon them. Her presence at what is considered 
the birthday of the Church convinced the bishops at Vatican II to call Mary the 
Mother of the Church.
 
Mary’s perpetual virginity (before, during, and after the birth of Christ her 
son) is a doctrine of the Catholic faith, as are her Immaculate Conception and 
her Assumption. These dogmas flow from the same central dogma that any 
and all privileges and honors given to Mary are based solely on her unique 
relationship to Christ, her son.

29
 Chapter 2: Angels and the Blessed Virgin
Celebrating Mary’s feast days
Mary has several feast days. Being the human Mother of Jesus, her maternal 
relationship is real and permanent. Therefore, just as any son or daughter 
would honor special occasions in the life of his or her mother, so, too, the 
Church observes the unique events in the life of the Mother of the Savior. 
Following is a quick rundown:
 
✓ Her birth is celebrated on September 8 in the Latin Church. The Church 
only celebrates three earthly birthdays: Jesus Christ on December 25; 
St. John the Baptist on June 24; and the Virgin Mary’s. The feast days 
for the other saints usually mark their heavenly birthdays — that is, the 
day they died. Mary’s earthly birthday is important because Jesus would 
have honored his mother’s birthday.
 
✓ The Church celebrates Mary’s conception just as it celebrates Jesus’s. 
December 8 is the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, flowing 
from the dogma of the Immaculate Conception defined by Pope Pius IX 
in 1854. This dogma teaches that by a special grace from God, the Virgin 
Mary was preserved from all sin, even original sin, from the moment of 
her conception so that when she grew up, she could become the Mother 
of the Messiah. As such, she would need to be free from sin so she could 
give Jesus an untainted human nature.
 
✓ Mary’s Assumption into heaven is celebrated on August 15. This day 
marks the taking up of Mary’s body and soul by Jesus. (The Ascension 
is when Jesus himself took his body and soul into heaven 40 days after 
Easter. The Assumption is when he took his mother’s body and soul to 
the same place.)
 
✓ The Motherhood of Jesus is celebrated on January 1. It was formerly the 
Feast of the Circumcision, but the Second Vatican Council wanted to 
begin the civil new year by honoring Mary, the Mother of God.
 
✓ Mary’s Queenship is celebrated August 22. This feast is relatively new on 
the calendar, but the title is ancient. It’s an extension of the honor due 
to Christ the King and by extension to Mary, who is the Mother of the 
King. As Queen Mother, she is honored, venerated, and highly respected 
above all other humans and angels.
 
✓ Numerous other Marian feasts honor various apparitions (appearances 
of Mary) such as Lourdes, Fatima, Guadalupe, Knock Ireland, and so on. 
Other feasts associated with Mary, such as Our Lady of Mount Carmel 
(July 16) and Our Lady of Seven Sorrows (September 15), are secondary 
to the major ones listed here.

30
Part I: In the Beginning 
Did Mary die?
The Church has never defined the death of 
Mary as doctrine. The Orthodox and Byzantine 
churches celebrate the Feast of the Holy 
Dormition of Mary, which basically means 
falling asleep. Because the Immaculate 
Conception preserved her from original sin, 
Mary also would have been spared the con-
sequence of sin, namely death. But because 
she freely chose to share her son’s sufferings 
by staying with him at the cross, theologians 
believe that she would have freely chosen to 
share in death as well.
This is why Pope John Paul the Great specu-
lated that it would be theologically sound to 
hold that Mary died before her Assumption 
into heaven. But he didn’t formally endorse 
that teaching as official doctrine. Hence, the 
question is still open for reasonable debate 
among theologians. Her body being taken up to 
heaven, however, is not open for debate.
Why take her body into heaven anyway? Jesus 
took his body when he ascended, and the 
Church solemnly teaches the resurrection of 
the body at the end of the world. Each human 
person is a unique union of one body and 
one soul, temporarily separated at death and 
reunited at the end of time, when the Second 
Coming of Christ takes place. To reward his 
mother and to give the faithful hope in their own 
resurrection, Jesus took his mother’s body and 
soul into heaven — just as believers hope he 
will do with them on the last day.

Chapter 3
Starting at the Beginning: 
Apostles and Evangelists
In This Chapter
▶ Jesus’s followers as the first saints
▶ Early saints who spread the Gospel
T
he early saints are those who witnessed firsthand (or who personally 
knew actual eyewitnesses of) the teachings and miracles of Jesus Christ 
and who helped spread the word of God. In this chapter, we introduce you 
to the Apostles and Evangelists who walked alongside Christ and documented 
the journey. We discuss the struggles they faced, the battles they fought, 
and the way each one met his demise.
 
An Apostle is one of the original 12 men chosen by Jesus to be his follower. 
Evangelists are the four men inspired by the Holy Spirit to write a Gospel 
account of Jesus.
St. Peter
Galilee (first century BC–AD 64)
Patron: diocese of Rome, fishermen
Feast day: June 29
Peter, a fisherman, was given the honor of leading the disciples after Jesus 
ascended into heaven 40 days after his Resurrection from the dead. Born 
Simon bar Jona (son of John in Hebrew), Jesus later called him Peter (from 
the Greek word petra, meaning “rock”) to designate that he would be the 
“rock” on which Christ would establish the Church (Matthew 16:18).

32
Part I: In the Beginning 
 
The Gospel mentions Peter’s mother-in-law, so he must have had a wife at 
some time. However, her name is never revealed, and she isn’t even mentioned 
in the telling of Jesus’s miraculous cure of her mother (Mark 1:29–31). This 
anonymity, combined with Peter’s travels spreading the Good News, indicates 
that his wife may have passed away before Jesus called him to be an Apostle.
 
Of the 12 Apostles handpicked by Jesus, Peter was chosen to be in charge 
after Christ’s Ascension to heaven. The other Apostles recognized Peter’s 
authority and didn’t challenge him as the head of the Church on earth. This 
is evidenced when John ran to the tomb ahead of Peter on Easter Sunday. He 
was younger and faster, but, although he got there first, he didn’t go in; 
rather, he waited for Peter out of respect for his position as chief Apostle 
(John 20:4–5).
The Acts of the Apostles (the book following the Gospel of John) discusses 
several examples of Peter’s leadership of the early Church, especially after 
Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit came upon the Apostles and the Virgin Mary, 
50 days after Easter and 10 days after Jesus ascended to heaven.
St. Peter’s keys
One of the most ancient symbols of the papacy 
are the two keys, one gold and the other silver, 
symbolic of the keys Jesus mentions in the 
Gospel when he says
 
 Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For 
flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, 
but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell 
you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will 
build my church, and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it. I will give you the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever 
you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, 
and whatever you loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven.
Bible scholars see the keys as a symbol of 
authority. Traditionally, kings had prime min-
isters who were given two keys: a gold one 
to the royal treasury to protect the collected 
taxes, and a silver one to the royal prison where 
the king’s enemies were incarcerated. With 
these keys, a prime minister could, at his own 
discretion, release prisoners to show the mercy 
of the crown or levy more taxes to replenish a 
depleted treasury. Statues and icons of St. 
Peter typically portray him holding two keys in 
his hand.
When Jesus gave Peter the “keys of the king-
dom of heaven,” he symbolically gave Peter 
full authority to loose and to bind, just as a 
trusted prime minister would in service to his 
king. This passage is invoked to support the 
Catholic teaching on papal infallibility and 
papal primacy. The first refers to the pope’s 
teaching authority (limited to faith and morals), 
assuring that the Holy Spirit prevents him from 
imposing an erroneous doctrine on the faithful. 
The second refers to the pope’s jurisdiction as 
supreme head of the Catholic Church in terms 
of internal organization; in other words, he 
possesses executive, legislative, and judicial 
authority on Church matters.

33
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
Peter’s authority also is shown when he presides over the election of 
Matthias to replace Judas (Acts 1:26) and when he leads the Council of 
Jerusalem (Acts 15). Even St. Paul (after his conversion and change of name 
from Saul) “goes to see Peter” out of respect for his position (Galatians 1:18).
Peter was martyred in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero, who ruled from 
AD 54 to AD 68. It’s believed that Peter was arrested and imprisoned not far 
from where the Roman Coliseum now stands. Today, the St. Peter in Chains 
Church marks the spot of Peter’s arrest. It’s a minor basilica with a great trea-
sure: a statue of Moses that Michelangelo carved out of Carrara marble.
According to pious tradition, Peter didn’t consider himself worthy of Christ-
like crucifixion because he had denied his association with Jesus three times 
on Good Friday. Roman soldiers instead crucified him upside down (see the 
nearby sidebar on “St. Peter’s Cross”).
Peter is buried on Vatican Hill, the present-day site of the Basilica of St. Peter, 
where the pope most often celebrates Mass.
 
Three churches have been built over this site through the centuries. The first 
was built in the fourth century by Constantine, who first proclaimed the joint 
feast of Peter and Paul. The second was built in the ninth century directly on 
top of the earlier edifice. Pope Julius II laid the cornerstone in 1506 and Pope 
St. Pius V finished the present-day basilica in 1615, again directly over the 
ninth-century church.
In 1938, Pope Pius XII permitted archaeologists to excavate under the basili-
cas, all the way to the first-century cemetery, which led to the discovery of 
the famous “Red Wall.” The wall of one of the tombs is marked in red graffiti, 
noting the final resting spot of Peter and Paul. The first-century tomb lies 
directly under Bernini’s magnificent 16th-century canopy over the high altar.
SS. Peter and Paul are shown together in Figure 3-1. Paul is depicted on the 
left holding a sword, the means of his martyrdom, while Peter is on the right 
holding keys, referencing the authority Jesus gave him as head of the Church 
in the Gospel of Matthew (16:19).
St. Peter’s Cross
Traditionally, the inverted cross is known as the 
Cross of St. Peter or St. Peter’s Cross because, 
according to pious tradition, Peter felt him-
self unworthy to be martyred the same way 
Christ was, and the Roman soldiers crucified 
him upside down. Unfortunately, the advent 
of Satanism and the occult brought its perver-
sion of an upside-down crucifix of Jesus. Thus, 
today you rarely see St. Peter’s Cross on any 
contemporary piece of church art or vestment.

St. Andrew
Bethsaida (first century AD–AD 69)
Patron: fishermen, Scotland, Greece, Constantinople
Feast day: November 30
Brother to the man who would become their leader, Andrew was the first of 
Jesus’s Apostles.
Andrew was born in Bethsaida in Galilee, the same area in which St. John the 
Baptist, a cousin to Jesus, first preached that Jesus was the Messiah. Andrew 
was so impressed that he sought out Jesus for further instruction. Inspired, 
uplifted, and overjoyed, Andrew recruited his brother (Simon, whom Jesus 
renamed Peter — see the preceding section), who also became a disciple.
The Sea of Galilee and fishing played an important role in the brothers’ lives. 
Fishing was their livelihood, and the Lord used the sea and fishing many 
times as points of reference. The Lord used their fishing boat as a pulpit to 
preach to those gathered along the shore, right before the miracle of the 
loaves. Andrew and Peter witnessed Jesus walking on the water from their 
boat. Finally, after a bad night of fishing, Jesus encouraged them to go out 
once again in their fishing boat, and the brothers came back with their boat 
overflowing with fish. When they returned, the Lord bid them to become 
“fishers of men” and to follow him (Matthew 4:18–19).

35
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
St. Andrew is believed to have taken the message of the Gospel to Greece 
and even as far as Constantinople. He was martyred by crucifixion, tied to 
the cross in the form of an X. To this day, the 24th letter of the alphabet is a 
symbol of St. Andrew. The Scottish flag is blue with a white X representing its 
patron.
During the Middle Ages, the relics of St. Andrew were transferred to the 
Republic of Amalfi on the southwest coast of Italy, where the Basilica of 
St. Andrew still houses some of his remains; other relics are in Rome. In a 
gesture of ecumenism, Pope John Paul II returned the relic of St. Andrew’s 
head to the patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church. Customarily, a 30-day 
Christmas novena commences on his feast day and continues to the feast of 
Christmas.
St. James the Greater
Galilee (first century AD–AD 44)
Patron: Spain, arthritis, hat makers
Feast day: July 25
James is one of a three-man privileged inner circle of Jesus’s Apostles, join-
ing St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist. These three were allowed to witness 
miracles that the other Apostles only heard about. James witnessed the cure 
of Peter’s mother-in-law and the raising of Jarius’s daughter from the dead, 
among other miracles.
James the Greater was the brother of St. John the Evangelist and one of 
Zebedee’s sons. (Two Apostles are named James; this one is known as “the 
Greater” because he was the older of the two.) Like Peter and Andrew, James 
earned his living as a fisherman. He and his brother, John, were called by the 
Lord at the same time he called Peter and Andrew.
 
Peter, John, and James were the fortunate witnesses to Jesus’s Transfiguration 
on Mount Tabor. This event was most important, for the Lord dazzled the 
Apostles with his divinity right before his pending passion. As members of the 
inner circle, their testimony and faithfulness would be needed after the Lord’s 
crucifixion.
Pious tradition holds that, after the Ascension of the Lord, James brought 
the message of Jesus to Spain and evangelized that country. In fact, there’s 
a magnificent basilica of Santiago (Spanish and Portuguese for St. James) in 
Compostela, in Spain’s northwest corner. Compostela lies at the center of 

36
Part I: In the Beginning 
the most famous pilgrimage trails throughout all of Europe; since the early 
Middle Ages, pilgrims have traveled roads from Rome, France, and Spain 
to this shrine, where relics of St. James are believed to lie in repose. (Other 
relics of the saint are housed in Rome.)
As he was led outside Jerusalem for martyrdom, James walked by a man crip-
pled with arthritis, who begged James for a cure. James prayed over him and 
commanded him to stand up, and the man was miraculously cured. Today, 
despite all the advances in medicine, arthritis has no cure. Those suffering 
from it may seek relief through prayers to James the Greater.
St. John the Evangelist
Galilee (first century AD–AD 100)
Patron: editors, writers, burn victims, poison victims
Feast day: December 27
St. John the Evangelist, the Beloved Disciple, was the youngest of the 
Apostles and the third to be admitted to Jesus’s privileged inner circle, along-
side St. James the Greater and St. Peter. He wrote the fourth Gospel and is 
also known as John the Divine for his lofty theology.
 
John was one of the three Apostles (along with his brother, James the Greater, 
and Peter) privileged to witness Jesus’s Transfiguration on Mt. Tabor 
(Matthew 17:1–6). On Easter Sunday, John raced to the tomb after hearing that 
Mary Magdalene discovered it empty. Out of respect for Peter’s position as 
the leader of the Apostles, John waited outside the tomb until Peter entered 
(John 20:1–9).
Before the Savior died, he entrusted his mother, the Virgin Mary, to the care 
of John, the Beloved Disciple (John 19:27). Pious tradition holds that she 
lived with John in Ephesus until her Assumption in Jerusalem.
Pious tradition also asserts that after Mary’s Assumption, John began his 
missionary expeditions throughout Asia Minor. He was arrested under the 
reign of the Emperor Domitian, who tried to boil him in oil. John was miracu-
lously preserved, not only from death but also from any harm.
He was then banished to the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. On this 
island, John received personal revelations that formed the Book of Revelation 
or the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament and of the Christian 

37
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
Bible. He received these revelations in a cave located under the present-day 
monastery dedicated to his honor. John later traveled to Ephesus, where, 
inspired by the Holy Spirit and aided by his devoted friends, he wrote the 
Gospel According to St. John and the three Letters of St. John. In his letters, 
he addresses the Christian community as catholic, meaning “for all.”
Figure 3-2 shows an artist’s rendering of John on the island of Patmos. The 
eagle (sitting on the book to the right) is the most ancient symbol for John 
the Evangelist, just as the lion is for Mark, the ox is for Luke, and the man is 
for Matthew.

Compared to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, John’s is much more 
theological and philosophical. He writes for a Christian audience and gives 
more substance in some areas, such as the Holy Eucharist (John 6). His 
symbol as Evangelist is the eagle, because he opens his Gospel with lofty ideas 
of preexistence: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God 
and the Word was God.” His symbol as Apostle is a cup, with a serpent repre-
senting a failed attempt to poison him.
Because John was the youngest of the 12 Apostles, he’s often depicted in 
sacred art as beardless, unlike the other 11. This is why, in Leonardo da 
Vinci’s painting of the Last Supper, John, seated to Jesus’s right, looks very 
young. John is also the only Apostle who wasn’t martyred. He lived into his 
90s and died of natural causes, probably in Ephesus in present-day Turkey.

38
Part I: In the Beginning 
St. James the Less
(first century AD–AD 62)
Patron: fullers, pharmacists
Feast day: May 3
St. James was named the first Bishop of Jerusalem, and because of his loca-
tion, he became a champion for Jewish converts to Christianity.
 
James is the author of the New Testament epistle in his name. He is called “the 
Less” to distinguish him from the older James (see the section on St. James 
the Greater, earlier in this chapter).
St. James the Less was the son of Alpheus, brother to Joseph (often writ-
ten as “Joses”) and cousin to Simon and Jude. Although he was sometimes 
referred to as the “brother of the Lord” or the “brother of Jesus,” in reality he 
was a cousin, although we don’t know whether the relationship was through 
the Virgin Mary or her husband Joseph. (Ancient Greeks used the word adel-
phos to refer to any male relative, be it brother, cousin, uncle, or nephew, so 
precise relationships are often difficult to determine.)
Unlike Paul, St. James the Less favored following the Mosaic laws of circumci-
sion and diet. This debate led to the First Ecumenical Council of Jerusalem. 
Historic in nature, the council showed the workings of the Church after the 
Ascension of the Lord. James had been a strong proponent of requiring 
Gentiles to first convert to Judaism before converting to Christianity. After 
listening to Peter say in Jerusalem that there was a direct, fast-track conver-
sion from paganism to Christianity, James deferred to that decision.
There are many stories concerning the death of James the Less, but the most 
credible one comes from the Jewish historian Josephus. He wrote that James 
was martyred in AD 62 by being thrown from a pinnacle off the Temple and 
then stoned and beaten with clubs.
St. Bartholomew
Palestine (first century AD)
Patron: shoemakers, cobblers, butchers, tanners
Feast day: August 24
St. Bartholomew is believed to have carried the Gospel to several countries, 
resulting in a martyrdom of being flayed, or skinned, alive.

39
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
Nathaniel Bar-Tholmai is known just by his first name or by the common 
rendering of his surname, which literally means son of Tolomai.
Philip introduced Bartholomew to the Lord. When told that the Messiah had 
arrived and that he was Jesus of Nazareth, Bartholomew’s response was, 
“Can anything good come from Nazareth?” which prompted Jesus to say, 
“This man has no guile” (John 1:47); in other words, he speaks his mind.
John’s Gospel mentions Bartholomew as one of the Apostles to whom 
the risen Christ appeared at the Sea of Galilee after his Resurrection. 
Bartholomew is believed to have carried the Gospel to India, Mesopotamia, 
Persia, Egypt, and Armenia.
The remains of St. Bartholomew were transferred to two churches in Italy: 
Benevento and the Church of St. Bartholomew-in-the-Tiber in Rome. This 
saint’s main symbol consists of three knives representing his gruesome death.
 
Because of the manner in which he died, St. Bartholomew became the patron 
saint of butchers, tanners, and leather workers, who peel the hide off animals 
before the carcasses are sent to the butcher.
St. Thomas
Galilee (first century AD–AD 72)
Patron: India, Pakistan, doubters
Feast day: December 21
St. Thomas is perhaps best known for his post-Resurrection confession to the 
risen Savior.
After the Crucifixion, most of the Apostles were devastated; they didn’t quite 
grasp the fact that Jesus was the Messiah. When the Lord appeared to them 
on that first Easter Sunday, Thomas was missing. When the other Apostles 
told Thomas about seeing the risen Lord, Thomas said he wouldn’t believe it 
was Jesus until he had seen and felt the Lord’s wounds for himself — thereby 
becoming known as Doubting Thomas (and thus the namesake of skeptics 
who demand proof before being convinced).
 
A week later, the risen Lord once again appeared to the Apostles, and this 
time Thomas was present. He had Thomas probe his wounds, and Thomas 
made his solemn confession of faith in the risen Savior. Thomas’s doubt has 
become the certitude of faith for all those who weren’t eyewitnesses to the 
Resurrection. His famous confession is a classic for all those preparing to 
receive Holy Communion at Holy Mass: “My Lord and my God!”

40
Part I: In the Beginning 
There are many folkloric tales concerning Thomas, but most historians agree 
that he evangelized India, where he was martyred. Christians belonging to 
the Syro-Malabar Rite attribute their group’s foundation to Thomas.
Legend has it that King Gundafor commissioned Thomas to build a palace. He 
gave Thomas the money and then left on a long journey. When he returned, 
the monarch asked to see his new home. Thomas had spent all the money to 
help the poor and told the king that he had built him a heavenly home instead. 
Gundafor ordered Thomas’s death, but the night before the execution, the king 
dreamt of his dead brother, who told him of the gorgeous home Thomas had 
built for him in heaven. The next day, the king released Thomas, and his whole 
family converted to Christianity. King Mazdai, however, didn’t convert and was 
enraged when his wife did. He had Thomas speared to death in AD 72.
 
The apocryphal Gospel ascribed to Thomas was probably written by Gnostics 
who sought to vindicate their heretical ideas, and thus it isn’t part of the 
Canon (approved lists of inspired books) of the Bible.
St. Jude Thaddeus
Galilee (first century AD)
Patron: lost causes, hopeless cases, impossible burdens
Feast day: October 28
Jude is Aramaic for support of God. Jude Thaddeus was the brother of James 
the Less and author of the New Testament epistle named after him. The 
epistle isn’t addressed to any particular Christian community; rather, it’s a 
general exhortation concerning the scandalous behavior of some converts 
who have no intention of following the Lord.
After the commissioning of the 12 Apostles, Jude aligned with Simon and 
went to preach the Gospel in Persia. There he was martyred by being 
clubbed to death. He’s often pictured holding or resting on this instrument 
of torture.
 
St. Jude became the patron saint of lost causes partially because he was often 
mistaken for Christ’s betrayer, Judas (Jude) Iscariot, as they had the same 
first name.
This devotion as patron of desperate cases has two celebrated shrines 
in the United States. The first, in Chicago, was built as a place of hope for 
people hit hard by the Great Depression. The other is in Baltimore, the 
famous St. Jude Shrine on Paca Street, founded by Italians in 1873. The 
devotion to St. Jude at this church expanded during World War II, and many

 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
prayed for the safe return of the nation’s armed service men and women. 
Today, St. Jude’s Shrine in Baltimore is still a popular pilgrim destination 
for East Coast Catholics.
Another famous place is St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. 
Actor Danny Thomas prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus in the early 1950s when 
he was a young, unknown, and struggling entertainer with a baby on the way. 
Penniless, he promised St. Jude he would build a shrine if the saint would 
intercede on his behalf before the Lord. Soon his career in television took off, 
but he never forgot his promise and helped build the now-famous children’s 
hospital in honor of St. Jude, who had helped him many years before.
St. Matthew
Galilee (first century AD)
Patron: tax collectors, accountants, bookkeepers
Feast day: September 21
Matthew, originally known as Levi, may have been the last person Jesus’s fol-
lowers would have chosen as an Apostle. He was a tax collector, a profession 
loathed as being traitorous and collaborating with the occupying Romans. So 
despised were these “civil servants” of the Roman Empire that Jews were for-
bidden to marry or even associate with them.
 
Because of Matthew’s profession, there was something of a scandal when 
Jesus approached him. Yet, as Jesus himself often said, he came not for the 
healthy but for the sick, to seek the lost that they may be found. While not 
physically ill, Matthew was spiritually in need of healing. The invitation to 
become a follower of Christ was too great to resist, so he became a disciple 
when asked.
Author of the first Gospel in the New Testament, Matthew wrote for a pre-
dominantly Hebrew audience — that is, to Jews who were curious about 
or interested in Jesus but didn’t know the story. This is seen in his meticu-
lous attention to biblical references in the Old Testament prophesying the 
Messiah. His genealogy of Christ in the first chapter begins with Abraham and 
ends with Joseph, the husband of Mary. (Although Jesus wasn’t the biological 
son of Joseph, he was the adopted and legal heir in Mosaic law, so Jesus was 
properly known as the “son” of Joseph.)
Matthew also accentuates the connection between Jesus and Moses, the hero 
of the Old Testament, particularly through his comparison of Jesus’s Sermon 
on the Mount (Matthew 5:1) to Moses receiving the Ten Commandments 
from God (Exodus 19).

42
Part I: In the Beginning 
How St. Matthew was martyred isn’t known. His symbol is the figure of a man 
with wings, because he begins his Gospel with the genealogy of Jesus that 
shows the humanity of the Lord united to his divinity in one divine person.
St. Matthias
Judaea (first century AD–AD 80)
Patron: reformed alcoholics, tailors
Feast day: May 14
St. Matthias, whose name in Hebrew means gift of the Lord, was appointed an 
Apostle following the betrayal and suicide of Judas Iscariot, one of the origi-
nal 12 Apostles. Matthias was one of the original 72 disciples of the Lord from 
the time of Jesus’s baptism in the Jordan River.
 
After the Ascension of Jesus to heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at 
Pentecost, Peter and the other Apostles met to decide what to do about the 
vacancy left by Judas. The choice was between Matthias and Barsabas, and 
the Apostles chose Matthias by casting lots (Acts 1:26).
St. Clement of Alexandria explains how Matthias preached throughout 
Judea, Greece, and Cappadocia (in present-day Turkey), as well as the great 
discipline Matthias practiced. Based on his experiences with the Lord, he 
was able to abstain from legitimate pleasures in order to control the lower 
passions. Subsequently, he became one of the patron saints for alcoholics.
He was martyred in Jerusalem, stoned to death. In the fourth century, St. 
Helena transferred his relics to Rome.
St. Philip
Galilee (first century AD–AD 80)
Patron: pastry chefs, jockeys and horsemen, Uruguay, Luxembourg
Feast day: May 3
Little is known about St. Philip, other than he was with the other 11 Apostles 
for the Last Supper, for the Ascension, and for Pentecost.
A Galilean from Bethsaida, Philip was probably a disciple of John the Baptist 
before being called to follow Jesus. He introduced Nathaniel (also known 
as Bartholomew) to Jesus and is the one who said to Christ, “Show us the 

43
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
Father,” to which he responded, “Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the 
Father” (John 14:8–9).
He was present at the miracle of the loaves and fishes as Jesus directly asks 
him, “Where are we to buy bread so as to feed them [the five thousand]?” 
Philip replies, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough” (John 6:5,7).
Philip is believed to have traveled to Ephesus in present-day Turkey and to 
Phrygia and Hierapolis in present-day Greece, where he was martyred and 
buried. He was crucified upside down under the reign of Emperor Domitian. 
In the seventh century, his relics were transferred to the Basilica of the 
Apostles in Rome, where they are venerated today. His name means lover of 
horses, and so he is the patron saint of jockeys, horse breeders, and horse-
back riders.
St. Simon the Zealot
Cana (first century AD)
Patron: lumberjacks, woodcutters
Feast day: October 28
In Hebrew, Simon’s name means God has answered. He is also known as the 
zealot because of his religious zeal for the Hebrew religion. Not much more is 
known about Simon except the fact that he is listed as one of the 12 Apostles 
in the Gospels.
Pious tradition maintains that he preached in Egypt and Mesopotamia and 
was martyred in Persia in the first century by being sawed in half. He’s often 
pictured holding a lumberjack’s saw as his symbol.
St. Mark
Palestine or Libya (first century AD–AD 68)
Patron: Venice, lion trainers
Feast day: April 25
 
St. Mark, one of the original 72 disciples, was never appointed an Apostle. He 
was the youngest follower of Christ; when Jesus was arrested prior to his 
Crucifixion, Mark fled from the Temple guards so quickly that he left his tunic 
behind.

44
Part I: In the Beginning 
Author of the second Gospel, Mark wrote for a Roman audience. His Greek 
(the language used by all four Evangelists to write the Gospels) was so good 
that scholars believe he was a Greek convert to Judaism before becoming a 
follower of Jesus. His mother was the sister of St. Barnabas, companion to 
St. Paul.
Mark used the same kind of literary tools as Matthew in that he reported 
what he knew a Roman would want to hear — no more and no less. Mark is 
the shortest of the four Gospels and is very active with short sentences.
Mark eventually preached the Gospel all the way to Alexandria, Egypt, where 
he was martyred. Arrested for his faith, Mark was bound and gagged and 
then dragged by horses through the streets of the city.
His symbol is the lion with wings, as his Gospel opens describing John the 
Baptist as a “voice crying in the wilderness,” much like a lion would do (Mark 
1:3). The relics of St. Mark were transferred to Venice more than a thousand 
years ago, and even today, there are lions all over the city. Even the great 
basilica, originally the Doge’s Chapel, was renamed St. Mark.
St. Luke
Antioch, Syria (first century AD–AD 84)
Patron: physicians, healthcare workers, painters
Feast day: October 18
St. Luke, a Greek physician and convert to Christianity, wrote the third 
Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles in his native language. After his conver-
sion, he belonged to the Christian community in Antioch and met St. Paul. 
Eventually, Luke accompanied Paul on some of his missionary journeys. St. 
Paul was physically not very healthy, and it’s widely believed that Luke took 
care of him.
Besides being a physician, Luke was also a historian and documented hap-
penings of the day. His attention to detail is reflected in his writing. Only 
in St. Luke’s Gospel are there such details as the Annunciation of Mary, 
the Visitation, 6 miracles, and 18 parables. The miracles are especially 
poignant, because Luke was a doctor and naturally concerned with physi-
cal illness. In Acts, Luke shares wonderful insights into the workings of the 
first-century Church.

45
 Chapter 3: Starting at the Beginning: Apostles and Evangelists
 
Luke’s Gospel accentuates Jesus in his universal call to holiness to save all 
men and women, not just the chosen people of Abraham. He mentions the 
conspicuous times Jesus speaks and interacts with non-Jewish persons, like 
Samaritans, Greeks, and Romans. The Gospel of Luke has been called the 
“gospel of mercy” for all the miraculous healings it describes, and the 
“gospel of women” for the prominent role women play, in contrast to the 
other Gospels.
Legend relays that Luke was also an artist. The first icon of Mary and the 
baby Jesus is attributed to him.
Luke eventually met up with the Virgin Mary in Ephesus. This is where 
he learned about the infancy of Christ and everything that surrounds the 
Lord’s birth.
Not much is known about Luke’s death. Some early Church Fathers declare 
he died at the age of 84; others say he was martyred. In any event, his relics 
were transferred to Constantinople, the new capital of the empire in the 
fourth century. Before the fall of the Byzantine Empire, his relics were moved 
to Rome.
St. Paul
Tarsus (first century AD–AD 65)
Patron: preachers, writers, tent makers
Feast day: January 25 (Conversion of St. Paul)
 
Known before his conversion to Christianity as Saul of Tarsus, Paul is proba-
bly the most mentioned in all of the New Testament Scriptures — 14 of the 27 
books of the New Testament are ascribed to his name. While he wrote no 
Gospel, he did write pastoral letters to early Christian communities with a 
message that transcends time and space and which the Church considers 
divinely inspired.
He was born in Tarsus and was thus a Roman citizen. A member of 
the Pharisees, Saul was a militant persecutor of the new-found sect of 
Christianity. He saw Christians as disloyal to their Hebrew religion and con-
sidered Christianity a perversion, not a valid expression of Judaism. He was 
present at the stoning of St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr and deacon of 
the Church (Acts 7:58).

46
Part I: In the Beginning 
 
Saul’s outlook irrevocably changed while he was on the way to Damascus to 
round up Christians (men, women, and children). He was knocked to the 
ground and heard the voice of Jesus say, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute 
me?” (Acts 9:4). He realized that he was persecuting Jesus by persecuting his 
followers. Christ had already died, risen, and ascended when Saul had this 
encounter. From that moment onward, he was known as Paul. Temporarily 
blinded after hearing the voice, Paul fully recovered his sight when Ananais 
laid hands on him and baptized him (Acts 9:18).
After his conversion, Paul went on three missionary journeys. On the first 
journey, he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians. On his second journey, he 
wrote his Epistles 1 and 2 Thessalonians. On his third journey, he wrote his 
Epistles 1 and 2 Corinthians and Romans.
Paul had to use his Roman citizenship to escape the death penalty in 
Jerusalem by his former colleagues, the Pharisees and Sadducees. During his 
imprisonment he wrote letters (epistles) to Christian communities, encourag-
ing whenever possible but also chastising when necessary. These epistles 
include Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon, Philippians, 1 Timothy, Titus, and 2 
Timothy. His whole journey on foot and at sea is seen as a living symbol of the 
spiritual journey every Christian must make to get from this world to the next.
Because of his Roman citizenship, he couldn’t be crucified and could only be 
executed by the sword (beheading); he also appealed his case to Emperor 
Nero. This assured him safe passage to Rome, and at imperial expense. He 
was shipwrecked for a while in Malta, but eventually was sent on to Rome, 
where he was martyred in the same place as St. Peter before him.
Today, a magnificent basilica marks the spot of Paul’s martyrdom, known as 
St. Paul Outside the Walls because it’s literally located outside the Aurelian 
Walls of the city of Rome.

Part II
Put to the Test

In this part . . .
T
he lives of would-be saints weren’t without trials; 
many were persecuted and even killed for standing up 
for their faith, while many more faced battles with their 
own individual weaknesses. Whether living a life of total 
celibacy and chastity (consecrated virgins) in service to 
the Church or dealing with unpleasant, unhappy, difficult, 
painful, and almost unbearable obstacles, these saintly 
men and women are equally honored. 
In this part, we look at how some of the saints overcame 
obstacles and their own weaknesses, and we also look at 
the peculiar phenomenon of the incorruptibles — those 
saints whose bodies stayed wholly or partly undecayed, 
regardless of how long they’d been dead. Other saints we 
examine are the brave men and women who suffered a 
martyr’s death, as well as the holy virgins and religious 
women who faithfully served their God with every fiber of 
their being.

Chapter 4
Overcoming Weakness
In This Chapter
▶ Persevering over personal character flaws
▶ Dealing with bad influences
T
he saints we profile in this book weren’t perfect or sinless by any stretch 
of the imagination; they were normal human beings with the same temp-
tations and foibles as anyone else. Some were weaker or more flawed than 
others, and they overcame their disadvantages through God’s grace.
In this chapter, we focus on some of these saints who had to vanquish vari-
ous weaknesses in order to have a closer relationship with God.
St. Augustine (Playboy to Puritan)
Northern Africa (AD 354–AD 430)
Patron: theologians, reckless youth
Feast day: August 28
Augustine was the eldest of three children born to a pagan, Patricius, and his 
devout Christian wife, Monica (see the entry on St. Monica later in the chap-
ter). He spent his youth living a wild and immodest life filled with indulgence 
and sin. In his autobiography (Confessions), Augustine told of sinning with 
gusto and breaking every one of the Ten Commandments, except the prohibi-
tion against murder. To make up for that one, he said, he broke the others 
even more often.
It wasn’t until he reached middle age and was accompanied by his illegiti-
mate son, Adeodatus, that Augustine began to see the error of his ways. He 
abandoned the playboy culture and gravitated to the opposite pole of the 
heretical Manichaeans. Theirs was a dualistic philosophy holding that the 
physical, material world was evil. Only the spiritual, immaterial world was 
important and had value to Augustine at this time, so he embraced a life of 
sacrifice and denial.

50
Part II: Put to the Test 
The Manichaeans disdained marriage and children, as children were the fruit 
of sexual intercourse, and anything so physical had to be evil. Christianity 
bridged and healed the gap between Augustine’s two lives, and Bishop 
Ambrose in Milan convinced Augustine and his son to embrace Catholicism. 
 
Augustine became a priest and, finally, Bishop of Hippo. He also synthesized 
the philosophy of Plato with Christian theology and was pivotal in establishing 
monastic life in the Western Church.
St. Camillus de Lellis 
(Compulsive Gambler)
Italy (1550–1614)
Beatified: 1742
Canonized: 1746
Patron: nurses, addicted gamblers
Feast day: July 14
Camillus was the son of a successful military officer and a mother who died 
when he was very young. He followed in his father’s footsteps and entered 
the military when he was of age. His father kept him busy, hiring out his ser-
vices whenever someone needed a soldier.
Camillus didn’t have a stable or wholesome upbringing and thus lived a rebel-
lious adolescence. Following once again in his father’s footsteps, he acquired 
a taste for heavy gambling and wagering, which often led to barroom brawls.
Once, when he and his father were traveling on foot to join the army in 
Venice, which was being raised to fight the Turks, both men fell terribly ill. 
Camillus’s father’s illness was the worse of the two, and he eventually suc-
cumbed to the illness. On his deathbed, seeing his disillusioned life pass 
before him, Camillus’s father asked for a priest and made a good confession, 
was anointed, and received the last rites. He died a repentant man.
Camillus, however, took a bit longer to see the error of his ways, joining a 
Franciscan monastery only after becoming totally destitute from gambling 
debts. At the monastery, he found that old habits truly do die hard. He often 
snuck out of the monastery to meet with old friends and engage in old habits, 
such as drinking to excess and gambling. His superiors at the monastery dis-
missed him, believing he wasn’t ready to commit to the monastic life.

51
 Chapter 4: Overcoming Weakness
Returning to his mercenary career, Camillus found little or no happiness. 
Remembering the peace his father had found, Camillus tried to reenter the 
Franciscan monastery, but his previous track record tarnished his reputation 
enough that he soon had to leave.
 
Camillus eventually founded his own religious community, the Fathers of a 
Good Death, in 1584. He bound himself and the members by a vow to 
devote themselves to the plague stricken, but their work wasn’t restricted 
to hospitals — they also cared for the sick in their homes. Pope Sixtus V 
confirmed the congregation in 1586.
St. Dismas (Thief)
(first century AD)
Patron: reformed thieves/criminals
Feast day: March 25
Dismas is believed to be one of the two thieves between whom Jesus was cru-
cified. He was the “good” or “repentant” thief who appeared remorseful of his 
sins and asked Jesus to “remember me when you come into your kingdom.” 
Jesus replied, “This very day you will be with me in paradise.”
 
Folklore surrounding St. Dismas in the Middle Ages alleges that both Dismas 
and Gestas, the unrepentant thief to Jesus’s left, first met the Holy Family 
(Jesus, Mary, and her husband Joseph) while they were fleeing from King 
Herod in Egypt during Christ’s infancy. Something about the three prompted 
Dismas to bribe Gestas not to rob them, and it’s believed that the thieves left 
them alone. This story is based on apocryphal, or noninspired, text, and no 
evidence exists to corroborate the information.
Evidence does exist, however, of the devotion to St. Dismas: Many reforma-
tories have been named in his honor as an homage to the belief that it’s pos-
sible to turn a new leaf and live a better life.
St. Jerome (Bad Temper)
Dalmatia (AD 340–AD 420)
Patron: anger management, Bible scholars, and translators
Feast day: September 30

52
Part II: Put to the Test 
Jerome was a brilliant scholar and linguist who was commissioned by Pope 
Damasus I to translate the Bible into one language (see Chapter 13). The Old 
Testament was written mostly in Hebrew, with several books in Greek, and 
the New Testament was written in Aramaic and Greek. Other than the acade-
micians, the general populace of the Western Roman Empire was literate only 
in Latin.
 
Jerome finished his Latin translation of the Bible, known as the Latin Vulgate, 
in AD 400; it took almost 30 years to complete.
Prior to being tasked with this monumental project, Jerome had spent a 
good part of his life battling his own demons. His Achilles’ heel was his quick 
temper; if verbal arguments didn’t get him into trouble, his writings did. A 
genius in his own right, Jerome got so absorbed in his research and work that 
he became detached from the social world. That’s where most of the contre-
temps began: He hated distractions while working on an important project, 
like translating the Bible into Latin.
The archetype of curmudgeons, Jerome didn’t take well to criticism or oppo-
sition and wasn’t anyone to tangle with. He responded to comments that 
he deemed unfair with tirades that would demean any notable adversary. 
Even St. Augustine, who admired Jerome’s high intellect, feared his vitriolic 
temper.
Knowing his own weakness and wanting to remove himself from tempta-
tion, Jerome found refuge living like a hermit away from people and avoiding 
people who annoyed him. He didn’t make excuses for his short temper, but 
he tried to adapt himself so that others wouldn’t become collateral victims 
of his wrath. Like an alcoholic who must avoid the bars, Jerome saw the ben-
efit of retreating to his own oasis, where he wouldn’t be tempted to lose his 
patience or temper.
St. Mary Magdalene (Former Prostitute)
(first century AD)
Patron: wayward women
Feast day: July 22
The Scriptures identify Mary Magdalene by name only three times: as the 
woman from whom Jesus exorcized seven demons, as one of the women at 
the foot of Christ on the cross, and as the first to discover the risen Jesus at 
the tomb on the day of the Resurrection.

53
 Chapter 4: Overcoming Weakness
Pious tradition (common belief on a nondoctrinal matter) extended beyond 
Sacred Scripture and identified Mary Magdalene as the adulterous woman 
whom Jesus saved from being stoned to death when he said to her accusers, 
“Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” Some also believed her to be 
the woman who washed Jesus’s feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, 
and then anointed them with perfumed oil. 
 
Some people allege that the male, patriarchal Church is responsible for impos-
ing the image of a former prostitute on Mary Magdalene to keep her “under 
control.” Many spiritual writers and theologians, however, believe that there 
was truly a Christian motive behind the identification. Jesus’s life and trials 
epitomized mercy and love, and what better example of those traits than 
showing forgiveness to a woman whose life was marred by sin?
Jesus went beyond showing mercy and may have intervened on Mary 
Magdalene’s behalf, preventing her from being murdered because of her 
sinful lifestyle. Rather than being an insult, the “former prostitute” label 
demonstrates that a woman at the lowest social and spiritual realm — a 
woman who committed the very public sin of prostitution — could rise to the 
highest heights, serving as “apostle to the apostles” by announcing Christ’s 
Resurrection. 
Biblical scholars still debate the issue — some insist that Mary wasn’t a 
prostitute or adulteress, and others contend that the circumstantial evidence 
says she was. The Church has never formally declared her occupation, but 
the late Archbishop Fulton Sheen, who had a popular TV show in the 1950s, 
thought that Mary’s dubious past was a romantic example of how much 
divine love can forgive: anyone and anything.
Mary also had the honor and privilege of being at the foot of the cross when 
Christ died on Good Friday. So far from being dismissed by the Church 
Fathers, Mary Magdalene became the premiere example of a sinner being 
redeemed and rising to great levels of holiness, thanks to the divine mercy 
of God.
Over the centuries, many “Magdalene” houses have been established to help 
save women from the abuse and exploitation of prostitution. The belief has 
always been that if someone as notorious as Mary Magdalene can turn her 
life around and become a devout disciple of the Lord, then, by God’s grace, 
anyone can follow in her footsteps.

54
Part II: Put to the Test 
St. Monica (Mother of a No-Good Son)
Northern Africa (AD 331–AD 387)
Patron: abused or neglected wives, mothers of wayward children
Feast day: August 27
St. Monica was the quintessence of patience. She was the wife of an abusive, 
cheating man, Patricius, who had a short fuse and a violent temper, in addi-
tion to a wandering eye. When he wasn’t arguing with Monica, he was cheat-
ing on her.
Monica also had to endure her horrible mother-in-law who lived with 
them — a stereotypical busybody who thrived on criticizing her son’s 
wife. Making matters worse was Monica’s lazy, irresponsible, reckless, and 
amoral son, Augustine. The eldest of three children, Augustine eventually 
moved in with his girlfriend without being married to her.
Despite their problems, Monica loved her family very much and wanted noth-
ing less than their conversion to Christianity and lives of holiness and moral 
living.
After almost 30 years of perseverance and prayer, Monica saw her dreams 
realized: Augustine and his illegitimate son were baptized.
She followed Augustine when he left northern Africa for Rome, foiling an 
attempt he made to lose her by altering his route and going to Milan instead. 
In Milan, Augustine met St. Ambrose, who was the one to finally baptize 
Augustine and his son. (See his section earlier in the chapter for more on 
Augustine.) 
St. Padre Pio (False Accusations)
Pietrelcina, Italy (1887–1968)
Beatified: 1999
Canonized: 2002
Patron: those falsely accused
Feast day: September 23

55
 Chapter 4: Overcoming Weakness
Although St. Pio (see Figure 4-1) became famous for having the stigmata — 
the miraculous appearance of the five wounds of Christ — on his hands and 
feet, he also gained notoriety by surviving the stigma of false accusations 
leveled against him. Though revered today as a holy man of God, St. Pio had 
enemies who at one point so twisted and distorted the facts that he was con-
sidered a devious fake.

Born Francesco Forgione, St. Pio wanted to become a Capuchin monk — a 
branch of the Franciscan friars — which persuaded his father to emigrate to 
the United States to raise money for the seminary education of his son. 
Ordained in 1910, he began going into trances while celebrating Mass, and 
he was often in a trance for nearly an hour. Although many, such as St. 
Catherine of Siena, considered this a sign of great sanctity, others com-
plained that Pio’s masses took too long, and he was consequently ordered to 
keep the daily celebration to just 30 minutes.
The stigmata appeared eight years later, and Pio’s hands often bled while 
he conducted Mass. His parishioners witnessed the phenomenon and word 
spread quickly; large crowds came from all over Italy to attend a Mass cel-
ebrated by this saintly man.
Pio often spent 18 hours in the confessional and had the gift of discernment, 
which allowed him to read souls and tell penitents when they forgot (or 
intentionally omitted) a sin during confession. The number of pilgrims to visit 
him at San Giovanni Rotondo escalated dramatically.

56
Part II: Put to the Test 
The local bishop was suspicious of the Capuchin Franciscans and doubted 
the authenticity of Pio’s gifts. He thought that the religious community was 
profiting from the sales of religious goods to the pilgrims that visited. The 
bishop complained to what was then called the Holy Office, now known as 
the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (run by Joseph Cardinal 
Ratzinger before he was elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005).
Both Pope Benedict XV and Pope Pius XI started Vatican investigations 
into Pio’s activities in the 1920s, and one papal physician, Franciscan Fr. 
Agostino Gemelli, accused Padre Pio of fabricating his stigmata by using 
carbonic acid. The mere allegation of fraud — despite the lack of due pro-
cess or adjudication — led Church authorities to forbid Pio from receiving 
visitors, hearing confessions, or celebrating Mass in public.
The censures were lifted in 1933, but the suspicion remained, and many 
didn’t believe that Pio was an authentic stigmatist. Others, a large majority of 
the faithful, never doubted his sincerity. Area Communists tried to implicate 
him in financial malfeasance, but again, nothing was ever proved.
Another investigation by Pope John XXIII in the 1960s was also inconclusive, 
but some influential Vatican bureaucrats kept the scrutiny going. More accu-
sations were cast against Pio, this time alleging sexual misconduct with some 
of his female devotees. Not only was no credible evidence discovered, but 
a thorough investigation exonerated Pio of all allegations. It took some time 
for his name to be cleared; Pio remained obedient through it all and quietly 
obeyed his supervisors, even when being unjustly punished.
When Pope Paul VI was seated in 1963, a Polish bishop, Karol Wojtyla, visited 
Pio. This bishop later became Pope John Paul II, who beatified Pio in 1999 
and canonized him in 2002.
 
Padre Pio is the patron saint of those falsely accused and/or those whose rep-
utations are destroyed by slander and calumny. Instead of retaliating or seek-
ing revenge, Pio prayed for his persecutors and forgave his enemies.

(Incorruptibles)
In This Chapter
▶ Looking good after death
▶ Showing God’s favor
A
small handful of saints have the extraordinary holiness of having been 
incorruptible, meaning that their bodies didn’t decay or decompose 
the way a body normally does after death. Their bodies weren’t embalmed 
or otherwise preserved, yet they remained intact long after decomposition 
normally would set in. In this chapter, we introduce some of these saints, 
sharing details of their lives and experiences as well as the circumstances in 
which their bodies were unearthed and examined.
St. Bernadette Soubirous
Lourdes, France (1844–1879)
Beatified: 1925
Canonized: 1933
Patron: those suffering from poverty
Feast day: April 16
The Virgin Mary made 18 visits to a poor, uneducated girl in France at a time 
when Catholicism was still viewed with suspicion. Although she was born 
into a prosperous wheat-milling family, Bernadette Soubirous’s fate changed 
at an early age. Her parents fell on hard times when she was 13 and eventu-
ally made their home in a one-room building that was once the town jail but 
had been deemed unfit for housing prisoners.

58
Part II: Put to the Test 
Because of her impoverished upbringing as a teen, Bernadette didn’t receive 
Holy Communion at the appropriate age and was quite a bit older than those 
with whom she served in preparation. She was often ridiculed for her lack of 
knowledge and understanding in both the spiritual and secular disciplines.
Bernadette’s first apparition came on a trip to the town dump with her sis-
ters to collect firewood. She didn’t know the woman who came to her until 
after her first few apparitions, when she came to know the woman dressed in 
white with a blue sash as “The Immaculate Conception,” a term that meant 
little to a girl of low intellect living in a remote Pyrenees village.
At this time in France there remained a residue of anti-Catholicism from the 
French Revolution. Processions, religious devotions, and especially shrines 
marking apparitions weren’t approved by the extremely secular government. 
For years, Bernadette underwent examinations, tests, and observations from 
both government leaders and the Church. Eventually, authorities determined 
that her apparitions were authentic.
Bernadette entered the Sisters of Notre Dame of Nevers, the same order that 
staffed her parish. She died from complications due to chronic asthma and 
tuberculosis of the bone, a horribly painful disease.
Bernadette was buried at the motherhouse chapel in Nevers on April 16, 1879. 
Her body was first exhumed in 1909 in front of doctors, representatives for the 
cause of her canonization, and the sisters of the order. Upon exhumation, they 
found no decay on Bernadette’s body; only the clothing, the wood around the 
casket, and the rosary she held had perished. The casket was opened again in 
1919, and the body of the future saint was found in the same condition as it was 
in 1909. Today, you can visit the motherhouse of the Sisters of Notre Dame of 
Nevers and venerate the saint in a beautiful glass retainer located in the chapel.
St. Catherine Laboure
Fain-les-Moutiers, France (1806–1876)
Beatified: 1933
Canonized: 1947
Feast day: November 25
Zoe Laboure was a French farmer’s daughter whose mother died when she 
was 8. Zoe entered the Sisters of Charity on the Rue du Bac in Paris on the 
same day a celebration was being held as the relics of St. Vincent de Paul 
were transferred to the convent chapel. (As you can read in his section later 
in this chapter, St. Vincent de Paul had influenced Sister Louise de Marillac to 
establish the Sisters of Charity.) Upon entrance to the Sisters of Charity, Zoe 
took the name of Catherine.

 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
The same evening that she entered the order, Sister Catherine began receiv-
ing apparitions. The first was the Lord bidding her to chapel; then came the 
Blessed Virgin Mary. Mary gave Catherine a task that was quite challenging 
for a young postulant, particularly at a time when France and the French 
Catholic Church were recovering from the devastating effects of the French 
Revolution and weren’t inclined to be impressed with a nun receiving miracu-
lous visits from heaven.
The Blessed Virgin instructed Catherine to create a medal with the image 
of Our Lady of Grace stomping on a serpent and the words, “O Mary, con-
ceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.” On the back of 
the medal, two hearts were to represent the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary. Those who wore the medal with devotion would 
receive great graces from God.
Fifteen hundred medals were made in 1832; by 1834, more than 130,000 had 
been made. Out of humility, Sister Catherine didn’t want her name to be 
attached to the medal or the miraculous information. After the first medals 
were cast, Sister Catherine returned to normal convent life in obscurity; only 
her confessor and the Mother Superior knew of Catherine’s apparitions. It 
was only eight months before Catherine’s death, under specific instructions 
from the Mother Superior, that the facts regarding the medal and the miracu-
lous information were revealed for posterity.
Sister Catherine died in 1876 and was buried in the crypt of the chapel. In 
1933, Rome announced her beatification and, following routine, the casket 
was excavated. The outer wooden casket had deteriorated while the inner 
casket, made of lead, remained intact. The third, wooden casket began to 
crumble upon opening, but the future saint’s body was in good condition and 
intact. The body of St. Catherine was transferred to the motherhouse chapel 
on the Rue du Bac, where her religious life had begun.
In this chapel, pilgrims can see St. Catherine Laboure in her blue habit with 
white coronet at the side altar. To the side of the high altar is the blue chair 
that the Blessed Virgin sat in when she appeared to St. Catherine.
St. Charbel Makhlouf
Bika’Kafra, Lebanon (1828–1898)
Beatified: 1965
Canonized: 1977
Patron: Lebanese Catholics
Feast day: September 5

Part II: Put to the Test 
Following his ordination into the priesthood at age 31, Father Charbel joined 
a monastery of strict observances and lived his life in solitude as a hermit.
Hermits generally take a vow of silence and live alone in small buildings 
known as hermitages. They generally come together for work, meals, and 
prayer, but live alone in an effort to solidify their relationship with God. 
During Father Charbel’s solitude, he practiced extreme penances of fasting 
and wearing a hair shirt to further discipline his body and make him even 
freer to love and worship God. His reputation for holiness increased, and 
people began to seek him out for prayers and blessings.
In 1898, Father Charbel suffered a fatal stroke. His tremendous love of the 
Holy Eucharist was apparent in that the host had to be physically removed 
from his hands after the stroke. He was buried in the monastery cemetery 
without being embalmed. Indeed, he wasn’t even placed in a casket because 
it was customary for the poor order to place their deceased members 
directly into the earth. When Father Charbel was buried, a bright light shone 
from his grave for more than 45 days. This marvel necessitated that his body 
be unearthed and examined. Despite abundant rain and no embalming or her-
metically sealed casket, the body was in excellent condition. In addition, oil 
resembling blood dripped from his pores in such abundance that the monks 
had to change Father Charbel’s habit twice a week.
In 1927, the body was examined again and was still in excellent condition. 
Father Charbel’s body was then laid to rest undisturbed until 1950, when oil 
exuded from the crack of the tomb. Again, the body was examined, and again 
it was in perfect condition, pliable and oozing this oil. Father Charbel was 
beatified in 1965 and canonized in 1977. At the time of his beatification, the 
Blessed Charbel’s body began to deteriorate. Today, only the bones of the 
saint remain, clothed in the vestiture of a priest with wax hands and face. His 
body is displayed in the St. Maron Monastery in Ananaya, Lebanon.
St. Francis de Sales
France (1567–1622)
Beatified: 1662
Canonized: 1665
Patron: journalists and writers
Feast day: January 24
Despite his father’s discouragement, Francis de Sales pursued the virtuous 
order of religious life early on. After ordination, he served as a missionary 
to the Lake Geneva region, an area that had fallen to the radical Calvinist 
Protestants. With the help of pamphlets explaining the Catholic faith, Father 
Francis recatechized the region of Chablis.

61
 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
Upon the death of the Bishop of Geneva, Father Francis was named his 
successor. He continued to work to reeducate people about the Catholic 
faith and authored The Introduction to the Devout Life, a practical guide for 
Catholics to give up old sinful habits and bring them in closer union with 
God. The guide is still used in spiritual direction and read by those who want 
to advance in the spiritual life.
Along with then-Sister Jane Frances de Chantal (see the next section), Francis 
founded the Visitation Sisters of Holy Mary. He also established a congrega-
tion of men known as the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, who were devoted 
to preaching parish missions-retreats, staffing colleges, and working in par-
ishes. His legacy had a powerful influence on other men and women in the 
centuries that followed, including St. John Bosco, founder of a congregation 
dedicated to the education of poor boys. This community, the Salesians, fol-
lows the spirituality of St. Francis de Sales.
Francis de Sales was canonized in 1665 and was declared a Doctor of the 
Church in 1877 (see Chapter 13 for more on what this means). His body was 
laid at rest in the Visitation Convent in Annecy next to St. Jane Frances de 
Chantal. When his body was exhumed in 1632, it was in perfect condition, but 
in subsequent years only the bones were found. Today, St. Francis de Sales 
can be venerated at the Basilica of the Visitation in Annecy, where his bones 
are placed under bishop’s clothing and a wax mask covers his face.
St. Jane Frances de Chantal
Dijon and Moulins, France (1572–1641)
Beatified: 1751
Canonized: 1767
Patron: people who feel abandoned and people with in-law problems
Feast day: August 12
Unlike many saints, Jane Frances didn’t immediately turn to a life of religious 
service. Her mother died when she was quite young, leaving her upbringing 
to her father. Jane married the Baron de Chantal, and for nine years she lived 
a peaceful and religious life as a good wife and mother of four children. A 
hunting accident claimed the life of her husband, leaving Jane Frances to sink 
into a deep depression.
Upon the urgings of her father, Jane devoted her life to her children as well 
as to the poor and sick in her area. She also ministered to the dying, to 
whom she offered much comfort, and continued to practice works of charity, 
mortifications, and prayer. Following a Lenten retreat and hearing the great

Part II: Put to the Test 
Francis de Sales (see the preceding section), Jane wanted to enter the clois-
tered Carmelite Nuns. Francis became Jane’s spiritual director, regulating 
her penances and devotional practices and sharing with her his vision of a 
new community of sisters, the Visitation Sisters of Holy Mary. Jane expressed 
great interest in helping Francis to establish this new community.
Jane overcame many obstacles in seeing the dream become a reality. She left 
her son with her father and took her three daughters to the convent. Within 
a year, one daughter passed away; the other two eventually married. The 
deaths of her father, son, son-in-law, and many sisters from the plague added 
to Jane’s suffering. In 1641, Jane died at the age of 69 in the state of grace and 
was buried near St. Francis de Sales in Annecy, France.
In 1722, her tomb was unearthed, and with the exception of some mold on her 
habit, Jane’s body was perfectly intact. During the French Revolution in 1793, 
the relics of St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane Francis de Chantal were carried 
by boat and hidden during the night for protection until the restoration of the 
church in 1806. In the restoration, the relics suffered much, and only the bones 
remained of the two saints. St. Jane was canonized in 1767 and her relics are on 
display for veneration at the Basilica of the Visitation. The bones are dressed 
in the habit of the order and a wax mask covers her face.
St. John Marie Vianney
Dardilly and Ars, France (1786–1859)
Beatified: 1905
Canonized: 1925
Patron: parish priests
Feast day: August 4
John Marie Vianney was born in the South of France just before the French 
Revolution. A national church was created after the Revolution, and priests 
or religious persons loyal to the Roman Catholic Church were banned from 
serving and were often martyred as a result.
By the time John Vianney wanted to enter the priesthood, seminaries and 
most Catholic institutions were closed. After the restoration of the hierarchy 
of the Church, instruction of candidates for the priesthood was left to parish 
priests and later to the bishops of the dioceses. Education of candidates was 
sporadic and fell short of typical preparation in the great seminaries and 
institutions of higher education.

63
 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
John received his religious education under these circumstances. That, and 
the fact that he was a poor learner, created doubt that he would ever be 
ordained. Churches and entire parishes were without priests, however, and 
bishops felt the urgency to ordain men, even if the new priests weren’t intel-
lectually equipped. John Vianney was ordained in 1818. He began his ministry 
under tutelage of a very holy pastor, and upon the death of his pastor, Father 
Vianney became pastor of a small, abandoned parish in Ars, France.
The town was remote and Catholic only in name and revealed the full effect 
of the French Revolution. The church building and priest house were in 
great disrepair, people didn’t attend church services, men frequented the 
bars and brothels to the abandonment of their families, and children weren’t 
properly educated in the Catholic faith. Father Vianney took the challenge 
and, little by little, began to turn things around in Ars. He repaired, cleaned, 
and restored the church building. He began catechism classes for the chil-
dren and wrote a catechetical book easy enough for the children to grasp. 
Along with a wealthy patron of the village, Father Vianney even founded a 
school for girls. He went to village bars and dragged husbands back to their 
families, preached magnificent but down-to-earth homilies, and conducted 
parish missions — a type of retreat that resulted in a boom of confessions.
All his efforts to restore the Church community came at quite a cost for John 
Vianney. Clergy in surrounding towns soon became jealous and maliciously 
maligned him. He was personally attacked by the devil when he tried to 
sleep. His health deteriorated due to extreme penances and denial of nourish-
ing food. Yet, people from Ars and around the region came to the village to 
seek the Cure of Ars for confession and spiritual direction. Habitually, Father 
Vianney would stay in the confessional for eight to ten hours a day.
John Vianney died after receiving the Sacrament of the Sick, commonly 
known as the last rites, on August 4, 1859. In 1904, his body was unearthed. 
Though a bit dried and darkened, his body was entirely intact. After his 
beatification, St. John Vianney was placed in a gold reliquary in a newly con-
structed shrine. Today, his body lies in a glass casket above the high altar in 
a newly constructed basilica near the old parish church in Ars.
St. Josaphat
Volodymyr, Poland (Lithuania) (1580–1623)
Beatified: 1643
Canonized: 1867
Patron: Ukraine
Feast day: November 12

64
Part II: Put to the Test 
Josaphat entered religious life at a time of strife within the Church. He had 
been baptized in the Ruthenian Orthodox Church, but that branch of the 
Orthodox Church later reunited with Rome. The reunification was a source 
of hostility and derision among the Orthodox, who still call the groups that 
have reunited with Rome the Uniates.
It was in this environment that young Josaphat entered the Basilian Order 
of Religious Men. He was soon ordained a bishop and later an archbishop. 
Despite the dangers, he labored and preached for the reunification of the 
Orthodox Church to Rome, which caused him political and personal strife.
Josaphat was killed and thrown into a river, and when his body was retrieved 
a week later by faithful followers, it was in good condition. It didn’t show the 
normal signs of deterioration that would be evident after a week in water. 
Twenty-seven years after his death, while the body was being prepared for a 
new elaborate reliquary, fresh blood flowed from the saint’s mortal wound. 
Because of the many wars in the region, the body was moved to St. Peter’s 
in Rome and can be seen today in this basilica. With the passage of time 
and many moves, Josaphat’s body has seen some deterioration in the face 
but otherwise remains in good condition. Pope Leo XIII canonized Josaphat 
in 1867 and, because of his successful proselytizing among the Orthodox 
Church, he was given the title “the Apostle of Union.”
St. Lucy Filippini
Corneto-Tarquinia, Italy (1672–1732)
Beatified: 1926
Canonized: 1930
Patron: schoolteachers
Feast day: March 25
Lucy Filippini dedicated her life to the education of poor girls, establishing a 
community of sisters further dedicated to that pursuit in the 17th century.
Cardinal Barbarigo, aware of the piety of the young Lucy, was instrumental in 
bringing her to an institute for teachers, where she excelled in study, devo-
tion, and service. She later founded the Maestre Pie Filippini, or the Religious 
Teachers Filippini, an organization that helped expand the pontifical commu-
nity and establishment of schools for girls.
Pope Clement XI summoned Sister Lucy Filippini and her sisters to launch a 
school in Rome. The number of students far surpassed the available space, 
and the community soon expanded throughout Italy, offering education to 
young, poor girls at a time when education wasn’t mandatory.

65
 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
Sister Lucy Filippini died in 1732. Her body was uncovered in 1926 and found 
to be nearly undamaged, save for minute deterioration on her face. Her body 
is located under the Baroque Domo of St. Margaret in Montefiascone, in a 
chapel carved out of an earlier church. Opposite St. Lucy Filippini are the 
remains of Cardinal Barbarigo.
 
In 1910, Pope Pius X responded to the needs of Italian immigrants to the U.S. 
by sending five sisters to America to staff parochial schools with the Maestre 
Pie Filippini. In 2010, the community will celebrate 100 years in America. The 
provincialate of the Religious Teachers Filippini is located in Morristown, New 
Jersey, and they retain the same charisma of St. Lucy. The sisters are now 
located in Italy, the U.S., Ireland, England, Brazil, and India.
St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi
Florence, Italy (1566–1607)
Beatified: 1626
Canonized: 1669
Patron: Naples, Italy
Feast day: May 25
Sister Mary practiced an ascetic way of life, often denying herself food 
other than bread and water. She suffered numerous attacks from the devil 
in the areas of chastity and gluttony. He would tempt her with impure 
thoughts, which she immediately rejected, and he would also tempt her 
to overeat, even when she wasn’t hungry. At other times, she experienced 
extreme dryness in her prayer life that left her with no compensation at 
all. It wasn’t until later in life that Mary Magdalene began to experience the 
spiritual phenomenon of ecstasy and on several occasions was found to be 
in an almost comatose state.
As novice mistress and director of the young nuns at the monastery in 
Florence, Sister Mary Magdalene encouraged the sisters to exercise the pen-
ances that she imposed upon herself, but she also cautioned that they strive 
for a balance in prayer, work, and relaxation. She acknowledged that not 
everyone was called to the extremes, as she was.
Sister Mary Magdalene died in 1607 and was entombed underneath the 
high altar in the monastery’s chapel. A year after her death, she was 
exhumed, and her remains were still intact. Her body soon began to emit 
a fragrant oil, a phenomenon that continued for 12 years. Three additional 
unearthings took place, the final one in 1663; Sister Mary Magdalene’s body 
remained flexible.

66
Part II: Put to the Test 
Today, the relic of the saint lies in the chapel of the monastery in a glass 
casket for all to view. She’s clothed in the Carmelite habit discalced (without 
shoes). Although her face is now colored, the flesh, muscle, and bones of her 
head, feet, and hands (that which is exposed to the public) remain intact.
St. Philip Neri
Florence, Italy (1515–1595)
Beatified: 1615
Canonized: 1622
Patron: Rome
Feast day: May 26
A young man born and raised into wealth, Philip Neri gave it all up at the age 
of 17 when he left home and chose to serve the Lord rather than pursue a 
career in business.
Philip went to Rome and found the city in great physical and spiritual dete-
rioration. There were many slums, and children of the city often ran amok. 
Suffering from the ill effects of the Renaissance, the city of Rome saw a 
decline in papal authority and in the education and sense of loyalty of the 
clergy. Philip committed himself to the re-evangelization of the city.
He began with the youth. Philip established pilgrimages for the children 
during the middle of the day, when they were most likely to get into mischief. 
He took the children to the seven churches of the city, talking to them all the 
way. Eventually, the children began to confide in Philip.
 
The practice of the pilgrimages to the seven churches is still followed today, 
especially on Holy Thursday, with the visits to seven repositories. 
(Repositories are temporary mini-chapels where a smaller tabernacle is used 
to keep the Blessed Sacrament after the Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy 
Thursday evening until the Easter vigil on Holy Saturday evening, thus leaving 
the main tabernacle in the church empty.)
Philip also reached out to young businessmen, offering weekly informal talks 
on theology and religion, which eventually led to the men staying for prayers. 
The gatherings were moved to a larger facility to accommodate the growing 
number of attendees.

67
 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
 
After his ordination into the priesthood, Philip remained a champion of the 
Catholic faith, becoming an instrument for many to return to the sacraments 
and the Church. He instituted the devotion known as Forty Hours, in which the 
Blessed Sacrament is exposed on the altar of a church for 40 hours while con-
tinuous prayer is made. This devotion to the Holy Eucharist is based on the 40 
hours Jesus spent in the tomb from his death on Good Friday until his 
Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Some parishes in the diocese are assigned a 
3-day (40-hour) time slot on the calendar every year where the Blessed 
Sacrament is exposed on the altar for public adoration. He also established a 
group of priests, known as the Oratorians, for which liturgy and youth confer-
ences were a hallmark.
Philip died in 1595. Four years later, his body was exposed and was found 
to be in good condition despite damp conditions. His body was embalmed 
in 1602, when it was moved to the new Oratorian Church, or Chiesa Nuova, 
where it still rests today. In 1622, Pope Gregory XV canonized St. Philip Neri 
and gave him the title “The Apostle of Rome.”
St. Rose of Lima
Lima, Peru (1586–1617)
Beatified: 1667
Canonized: 1671
Patron: Latin America and the Philippines; gardeners
Feast day: August 23
After ten years of disagreements with her parents regarding her desire to live 
as a cloistered nun — and her parents wishing to see her married — Rose of 
Lima was finally allowed to join the Third Order of Dominicans.
The order was a pious organization designed for laypeople, and it allowed 
Rose to continue to live at home while following the Rule of St. Dominic and 
wearing a habit. She eventually moved to an outer house on the property 
where she could practice her religious virtues.
As their fortunes began to wane, Rose helped support her family. She contin-
ued to practice her charity to those less fortunate by opening a small clinic in 
her family home to provide essential medical treatment to the poor.

68
Part II: Put to the Test 
From the days when she would disfigure herself by rubbing pepper on her 
skin, hoping to keep potential suitors at bay, Rose always practiced morti-
fications on herself. She continued to do so while in the order, but with the 
permission of her priest-confessor. In addition to the many penances, self-
denials, and prayers, she wore a crown of thorns over her veil. Eventually 
worn out by her penances, charitable work, and long hours of meditation, 
Rose died in 1617 at the age of 31. She was canonized in 1671 by Pope 
Clement X as the first saint of the New World.
Eighteen months after her death, her body was unearthed and found to be in 
excellent condition. Signs of deterioration were present, however, when her 
body was exhumed again a few decades later. Today, her relics are on dis-
play in the Dominican Church of Santo Domingo and in a small shrine church 
built on the spot where she lived. 
St. Veronica Giuliani
Mercatello, Duchy of Urbino, and Citt’di Castello, Italy (1660–1727)
Beatified: 1804
Canonized: 1839
Feast day: July 9
Sister Veronica developed a somewhat mystical devotion to the Passion of 
Christ in the early years of her religious life. After some disagreement with 
her father regarding her desire to become a cloister nun rather than marry, 
she was finally allowed to enter the Capuchin Order of Nuns based on the 
reform rule of the Poor Clares.
Sister Veronica experienced many mystical phenomena as a cloister nun, 
most notably the vision of the Lord offering the chalice of suffering to her. 
The apparitions and the impression of the stigmata of Christ led to a formal 
investigation by the bishop of the diocese who observed her wounds. 
For a time, Sister Veronica was isolated from any outside influences and 
couldn’t even receive Holy Communion. The isolation was a heavy cross for 
her to bear, yet the young nun endured the trial with patience and obedience, 
eventually being allowed to return to convent living.
Sister Veronica served for 34 years as a novice-mistress and forbade her 
young charges from dwelling on or reading any forms of extreme, mystical, 
theological works. Eventually, she was elected abbess of the order; she took 
care of the mundane problems of the convent with the same fervor she gave 
her spiritual life, thus living a well-balanced religious life while keeping her 
sufferings and stigmata private.

 Chapter 5: Looking at Undecayed Saints (Incorruptibles)
Following her death, Sister Veronica’s body remained incorrupt until the 
Tiber River overflowed its banks in a terrible flood. Now the bones of the 
saint are preserved with a wax facial mask and the habit of her order. Her 
heart is kept separately and miraculously remains in very good condition. 
Her remains are at the Monastery of St. Giuliani (Monastero Santa Veronica 
Giuliani) in Città di Castello, Italy.
St. Vincent de Paul
Gascony, France (1580–1660)
Beatified: 1729
Canonized: 1737
Patron: charitable societies
Feast day: September 27
Immediately upon ordination, Vincent’s life was dedicated to the corporal 
and spiritual works of mercy, notably among the sick, the poor, and the 
galley prisoners in France. To better meet those needs, he founded the 
Congregation of Missions, more commonly known as the Vincentians. The 
priests worked among the poor in missions and helped establish seminaries 
to provide proper education for future clergy.
Vincent’s work inspired St. Louise de Marillac, who cofounded the Daughters 
of Charity (also known as the Sisters of Charity). These sisters worked in hos-
pitals and among the destitute. In the U.S., the Sisters of Charity are known 
through St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, who established an American branch of 
that community. The Daughters of Charity is what the worldwide religious 
community of women is known by today. It includes both the American and 
French sisters as well as those all over the world.
Vincent died at the age of 80 and was buried in the St. Lazare Church in Paris. 
In 1712, his body was exposed and found to be in good condition except for 
some decay in the face. However, when the body was exhumed again, there 
was additional damage because of a flood. His bones are now encased in wax 
in the provincial headquarters of the Congregation of the Missions in Paris. 
His perfectly preserved heart is at the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity 
on the Rue du Bac in Paris.
 
Frederic Ozanam was inspired by Vincent’s work and in 1832 created the St. 
Vincent de Paul Society. This society, made up of laymen and women, quietly 
performs the corporal works of mercy among the destitute in local parishes.

Part II: Put to the Test 
St. Zita
Monte Sagrati and Lucca, Italy (1218–1271)
Canonized: 1696
Patron: servants
Feast day: April 27
Born to devout Catholic parents, Zita was a pious girl at a very young age. 
When she was 12, she moved into the home of a wealthy wool merchant in 
Lucca, Italy, as part of the cleaning staff. She considered her work part of her 
prayer life. She attended daily Mass, recited morning and evening prayers, 
and slept on the bare floor for penance.
Zita’s colleagues didn’t initially understand her devotions; some were jeal-
ous, and others felt guilty for not practicing their own faith. She was perse-
cuted for her piety, to the point that a male colleague made advances toward 
her and she was forced to physically defend herself. Her employers at first 
refused to believe her side of the story that she was an innocent victim and 
object of lustful and indecent intentions. They and many of her fellow ser-
vants preferred to believe the worst and presumed she had led the man on 
or had wanted to seduce him. She was totally chaste and pure but refused to 
answer their lewd interrogations because they had already decided she was 
guilty. Her innocence was later established and she was vindicated.
Zita’s reputation for charity soon spread throughout Lucca. During a famine, 
people lined up for food, and Zita gave away almost all of the family’s dry 
beans. She’d intended to restock the pantry but didn’t get the chance before 
the master of the house decided to take stock of the beans and sell them at 
market. Fearful that she would be fired or thrown into jail because of the 
missing food, Zita prayed, and, miraculously, the dry beans were restored.
Zita died at age 60 and lies in state at the local parish of San Frediano in 
Lucca. Her casket was opened three times, the last time being in 1652. Each 
time, the body remained perfectly incorrupt. Today, the saint’s body remains 
the same except for a bit of dryness and darkness to the skin.

Holy Martyrs
In This Chapter
▶ John the Baptist and other famous martyrs
▶ Lesser-known martyrs
M
artyrs are people who believe in their faith so strongly that they’re will-
ing to die for it. The original Greek word means “witness,” and these 
people are witness to their love of Jesus Christ and the Church in that they’d 
rather die than betray their God. Martyrs don’t murder anyone — suicide 
bombers aren’t martyrs, they’re homicide bombers. Martyrs don’t cause the 
death of innocent victims — martyrs are victims themselves. The martyrs we 
mention in this chapter were in love with the Lord and heaven more than with 
this world.
St. Agatha
Sicily (birthdate unknown–AD 251)
Patron: Sicily and Malta, women at risk of sexual assault, bell makers, and 
against breast cancer
Feast day: February 5
Agatha lived during the persecution of Emperor Decius. She decided very 
early to dedicate her life to Christ and to live in a pure and chaste manner. 
She forsook all advances from men, even Roman dignitaries.
One dignitary Agatha spurned was Quintian, a Roman official. Angered by her 
rejection and knowing she was a Christian, he reported her to the emperor. 
She was arrested and brought before a judge, but even threats of torture and 
death didn’t influence Agatha’s loyalty to God.

72
Part II: Put to the Test 
Quintian subjected Agatha to many forms of torture and abuse. He placed 
her in a house of ill repute and ordered her stretched on the rack and burned 
with iron hooks. Her breasts were tortured and then cut off, and she was then 
returned to prison without medication. Through it all, Agatha became more 
cheerful in her love for Christ.
St. Peter came to Agatha in prison and healed her wounds. Quintian was 
a witness to the miracle, but instead of converting to a life of faith, he 
increased his torturous efforts, ordering that Agatha be rolled naked over 
hot coals. It was after this last event, when she was returned to prison, that 
Agatha died.
The early Christians so revered Agatha that her name is in the Roman Canon 
of the Mass, also known as Eucharistic Prayer I. Devotion to St. Agatha 
soon spread throughout the empire and especially in Rome, where Pope 
Symmachus built a church in her honor in AD 500 on the Aurelian Way.
St. Agnes
Rome, Italy (AD 291–AD 304)
Patron: chastity, gardeners, girls, engaged couples, rape victims, 
and virgins
Feast day: January 21
Agnes consecrated her life to Christ at a young age and considered herself 
his spiritual bride. Like Agatha, Agnes came from a noble family and was 
much sought after by Rome’s noblemen. She thwarted their affections, 
however, and stood by her vows of purity and chastity. Her determination 
didn’t sit well with her prospective suitors, and they accused her of being a 
Christian, which was outlawed by Emperor Diocletian.
The Roman governor first tried simple things to influence Agnes and move 
her away from her consecration to the Lord. Seeing he was having no effect, 
he turned to threats. Agnes remained courageous, even while being dragged 
before Roman pagan idols and ordered to make an offering and worship. She 
refused, vowing to worship only the one true God. She was sent to a house of 
prostitution with orders that her virginity be violated.
A series of miracles kept Agnes pure. She was ordered to participate naked 
in a processional through the streets, but once outside, her hair grew from 
her head to cover her. At the house of ill repute, the governor allowed every-
one to have his way with Agnes, yet when people approached her, they were 
instantly blinded. One of the attackers was carried back to her room; Agnes 
prayed over him, and his sight was restored.

73
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
This final act so infuriated the governor that he ordered that Agnes be 
beheaded, and she went to the gallows cheerfully.
Agnes was buried in a cemetery on the Via Nomentana, and Emperor 
Constantine built a basilica in her honor over the cemetery. Pope Innocent X 
built a second church in Rome on the site where her chastity was threatened.
On her feast day, it’s customary to bring lambs into St. Agnes Basilica in 
Rome for a special blessing; afterward, the lambs are raised in a local monas-
tery until shearing. The wool is spun into strips of cloth, known as pallia. The 
pallia are blessed by the pope and given out to all the new archbishops on 
the feast of St. Peter and Paul.
St. Agnes is commemorated in the Roman Canon of the Mass. She is always 
pictured with a fern and a lamb. John Keats wrote the poem “The Eve of St. 
Agnes” in 1819, which is based on folkloric romanticism of a girl and a dream 
on the day before the saint’s feast day.
St. Blasé (Blaise)
Armenia (third century AD–AD 316)
Patron: the city of Dubrovnik, the wool industry, wild animals; and 
against ailments, diseases, and throat cancer
Feast day: February 3
Blasé was born in Armenia at the end of the third century. He was a pious 
young man who had a Christian education and became both a physician and 
an ordained bishop of the diocese of Sebaste in Armenia. He suffered perse-
cution under the reign of Emperor Diocletian. When harassment reached his 
see, Blasé retreated to the forests and lived in a cave, where many wild ani-
mals would gather around him peacefully.
While Blasé was in the cave, the Roman governor of Cappadocia, Agricola, 
came to Sebaste to continue mistreating the Christians. He sent men into the 
nearby forests to capture animals for their games in the amphitheater. The 
men found Blasé, deep in prayer and surrounded by wild animals. Agricola 
had him arrested and tried him for being a Christian, but Blasé wouldn’t give 
up his faith. Exasperated, the governor sent him to prison.
While on his way to prison, Blasé was approached by a mother whose son 
was choking on a fish bone. Blasé prayed over the child, and the bone was 
dislodged.

74
Part II: Put to the Test 
It’s customary on his feast day to receive the traditional blessing of the 
throats in honor of St. Blasé. Two candles placed in the shape of a cross are 
used in the blessing. The prayer that’s invoked for the special blessing reads: 
“Through the intercession of St. Blasé, bishop and martyred, may the Lord 
deliver you from all sicknesses of the throat and every other evil.”
One of the most beautiful shrines in his honor is in the port city of 
Dubrovnik, part of old Yugoslavia. In the 11th century, he became its special 
patron, and through his intercessions, he warned the people of the city about 
an imminent attack of the Venetian Republic, which ruled the Adriatic.
St. Boniface
Crediton (Devon, England) (AD 673–AD 754)
Patron: Germany, brewers, file cutters, and tailors
Feast day: June 5
Boniface was educated in a Benedictine monastery in Exeter, England, and 
was instrumental in reorganizing the Church in France. King Charles, the 
last Merovingian (the French dynasty that preceded the Carolingian, made 
famous by Charlemagne) king, was a tyrant and left the Church in decay. 
Although it was customary for the kings to appoint bishops, Charles often left 
positions empty or sold them to the highest bidder. And many of the bishops 
of the time were uneducated and lived lives of decadence.
After Charles’s death, his sons Pepin and Carloman ascended to the throne, 
and Boniface had much greater influence with these men. He was able to con-
vene a synod, or church council, that approved decrees calling for improved 
education and discipline among the clergy.
The relationship between the papacy and the Frankish king, Pepin, improved 
greatly. The Carolingian dynasty became a great supporter of the Holy See, 
and the seeds that Boniface sowed helped make the Church in France the 
Holy See’s eldest daughter.
Boniface was sent to Germany to establish the first diocese there in Fulda in 
AD 722. The Lord granted him great gifts of preaching and teaching as well as 
strong discipline to learn the many dialects of language in the region.
Boniface is often depicted with an axe, an image that dates back to a legend 
in which he is thought to have chopped an oak tree that was a sacred part 
of pagan ceremonies in Germany. After chopping the tree, he is said to have 
built a chapel in honor of St. Peter the Apostle on that very site.

75
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
The new chapel marked a turning point for Christianity in Germany. Boniface 
then established abbeys — schools staffed by Anglo-Saxon nuns. The mon-
asteries served as a basis for the beginning of missionary work, while the 
schools helped to further Christianity.
When he returned to Germany after visiting the pope in Rome, Boniface 
encountered a common problem: The newly converted Christian Germanic 
people, left without a strong structure, reverted to the old pagan religion. 
This occurred in the area where Boniface first established the Church. In 
AD 754, he returned to celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation, but he and 
his companions were attacked and martyred.
St. Cecilia
Rome, Italy (second century AD)
Patron: musicians
Feast day: November 22
Much of the information available about Cecilia is pious tradition (possible 
legend, or oral history without any other evidence); little about her life 
has actually been recorded as fact. The dates of her birth and death are 
unknown. Originally thought to have lived in the third century, later scholar-
ship now dates her 100 years earlier to the second century AD.
Common belief is that Cecilia was given in marriage to a pagan nobleman, 
Valerian, after she had already vowed to live a life of chastity. On the night 
of the wedding, Cecilia was able to not only convince her new husband to let 
her remain a virgin but also to convert him to Christianity. The two also con-
verted Valerian’s brother, Tiburtius, and the two men were baptized.
Valerian and Tiburtius were such staunch defenders of the faith that they 
sought the bodies of martyred Christians and buried them, an act that wasn’t 
looked upon with favor in those times. They were arrested and refused to 
recant their faith; both were put to death.
Cecilia found their bodies and buried both men. She, too, was captured. 
When she wouldn’t offer sacrifice to pagan idols, she was sentenced to death 
by suffocation in the bathroom of her home. She survived the suffocation and 
was ordered beheaded, but somehow remained alive for three days.
When Cecilia died, her hands were beside her confessing in the Trinity — 
three fingers extended for the three persons in one God, and two clutched to 
denote the second person’s incarnation.

76
Part II: Put to the Test 
She was originally buried in the Catacombs of St. Callixtus, where a statue of 
her was erected that depicted her real martyrdom of beheading. In the ninth 
century, Pope St. Paschal I transferred her body to a basilica in her honor.
Cecilia’s body is recorded as incorrupt, or non-decaying (see Chapter 5 for 
more on incorruptibles). Since the third century, without embalming and 
after laying at rest at first in the humid, subterranean conditions of the cata-
combs, her body miraculously remains intact. The last time it was exhumed, 
in the 17th century, her body remained the same.
St. Denis
Italy (third century AD–AD 258)
Patron: Paris, and against diabolical possession and headaches
Feast day: October 9
Denis was one of seven bishops sent on a missionary expedition to present-
day France. He was the first Bishop of Paris and is considered the city’s 
patron. He and the other bishops were quite successful in gathering several 
conversions on their mission trip, a feat that angered the pagan religious 
leader. Denis was beheaded on Montmartre — mount of martyrs — and his 
body was dumped into the Seine River. Some of his faithful followers went to 
retrieve his body and his head.
According to witnesses, Denis picked up his head and walked two miles, 
delivering a sermon the entire way, stopping only when it was time to die. A 
basilica was built in his honor at this site, and today, statues and images of 
St. Denis portray him holding his head in his hands. A monastery, St. Denis, 
was built on the site of his martyrdom and today houses his relics.
SS. Felicity and Perpetua
Birthplace unknown (AD 181–AD 203)
Patron: Carthage, mothers, expectant mothers, ranchers, and butchers
Feast day: March 7
Felicity and Perpetua were arrested during the Christian persecutions ordered 
by Emperor Septimius Severus. Felicity was Perpetua’s maid and companion; 
Perpetua was a married noblewoman who’d just given birth. Perpetua’s mother 
and two of her brothers were Christians; her father was a pagan. Her brothers 
and her mother were arrested alongside Perpetua and Felicity.

77
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
Felicity was eight months pregnant and Perpetua was nursing her newborn 
when they were arrested and martyred. At the time, many Christians and 
catechumens (pagans who were studying to convert to Christianity) were 
tortured by being fed to hungry animals. The Romans did this to appease 
the crowds and to dissuade others from following the new religion of 
Christianity. The emperor ordered that all citizens and inhabitants worship 
him and the Roman gods. When Christians like Perpetua and Felicity refused 
to commit idolatry, they were brutally martyred. Instead of discouraging 
others, the murder of these holy women actually encouraged more people to 
sacrifice — even sacrifice their lives — in order to gain heaven.
Perpetua wrote a detailed account of her imprisonment and the murders of 
her companion Christians. It was known as the Acta (account) and was very 
popular soon after their deaths.
St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen
Sigmaringen, Prussia (1577–1622)
Beatified: 1729
Canonized: 1746
Feast day: April 24
Fidelis was acutely aware of and in service to the poor and the sick, often 
giving up his own meals and tending to the ill — administering the sacrament 
as well as praying over them — at various infirmaries. He was recognized 
very early in life for his piety, wearing hair shirts under his clothes for a pen-
ance he knew no one else would see.
He was very successful in bringing people back to the Church during the 
Counter-Reformation. Because of his knowledge of philosophy and theol-
ogy and his skill as a preacher, he was sent with a group to Switzerland with 
hopes to reconvert those who left the Catholic Church to follow Zwibgili and 
the new Protestant religion.
His success in bringing people back to the Church angered the Calvinist 
Protestants, and they threatened his life. They made an unsuccessful attempt 
to kill him on April 24, 1622. A pious Protestant offered to house Fidelis 
for protection, but Fidelis refused. On his way home to his base at Grusch, 
Switzerland, he was murdered by 20 Calvinist soldiers.
Fidelis is depicted with a sword to denote his fidelity as a soldier of Christ 
and a palm branch to denote martyrdom.

Part II: Put to the Test 
St. George
Nicomedia, Mesopotamia (AD 275–AD 303)
Patron: England, Catalonia, The Netherlands, Georgia (the former Soviet 
country), Bavaria, Aragon, agricultural workers, equestrians, soldiers, 
and knights
Feast day: April 23
George was a Roman soldier for Emperor Diocletian at a time when being a 
Christian was a dangerous endeavor — never mind being a Christian in the 
emperor’s army.
Emperor Diocletian issued an edict in AD 302 calling for Christian soldiers to 
be arrested if they didn’t offer sacrifice to the pagan gods. George refused, 
but, remembering the bravery of George’s father as a soldier, Diocletian 
wasn’t prepared to lose him. He tried to bribe George with money, property, 
and titles if he would renounce Christianity, but George remained steadfast.
The emperor ordered that George be beheaded on April 23, AD 303.
The popularity of St. George soon spread through the East, and during medi-
eval times, a story called the “Golden Legend” brought his popularity to the 
West as well. It tells of a dragon living in a lake near Silena, Libya. Entire armies 
tried to defeat the creature and lost their lives. The beast ate two sheep a 
day, but when they were gone, the local villagers sacrificed their own maiden 
daughters to spare the entire town. St. George arrived and, hearing the dire fate 
of a young princess about to be eaten by the fiery dragon, he blessed himself 
with the sign of the cross and charged off to battle the serpent, killing it with a 
single blow of his lance. He then preached a moving sermon and converted the 
local pagans to the Christian faith. He was rewarded with a generous gift from 
the king whose daughter he rescued. St. George immediately distributed it to 
the poor and rode off to his next adventure.
St. Hippolytus of Rome
Rome, Italy (AD 170–AD 235)
Patron: Bibbiena (town in Italy), prison guards, and horses
Feast day: August 13
It may seem a bit odd that a man who once established himself as the first 
rival pope, or anti-pope, would reunite with the Church and become a saint, 
but that is the life of Hippolytus. He was born in the second half of the 

79
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
second century AD and was ordained a priest of Rome. An astute man and a 
great preacher and teacher, he was considered a rising star in the ecclesiasti-
cal chain. Yet his pride and knowledge got the best of him.
Hippolytus tangled with Pope Zephyrinus and Pope St. Callixtus and was 
eventually elected as a rival bishop in Rome. Pope St. Pontian had Hippolytus 
banished to the island of Sardinia under the new Christian persecution initi-
ated by Emperor Maximinus. Life on the island was abysmal and provided 
Hippolytus ample time to think. He reconciled himself with the Church, made 
amends for his pride, and confessed his loyalty to the true successor of St. 
Peter and authentic Bishop of Rome.
He was martyred in a most gruesome manner: Hippolytus was strapped to 
two wild horses who were then turned loose to drag him to death.
St. Ignatius of Antioch
Antioch (AD 50–AD 107)
Patron: the Church in the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa; 
throat disease
Feast day: October 17
Ignatius was a convert to Christianity under St. John the Evangelist and was 
named third Bishop of Antioch, the same diocese that once had St. Peter the 
Apostle as its bishop. Ignatius remained the bishop until his death.
Emperor Trajan started a fresh wave of persecutions against Christians 
who wouldn’t offer worship to the pagan gods. Although considered a good 
emperor, Trajan nevertheless was thankful to the gods for his victories, and 
he persecuted those who didn’t worship these gods.
Ignatius was arrested and brought to Rome for trial. On his journey, he 
stopped at Smyrna and wrote four important letters: one each to the 
churches in Ephesus, Magnesia, Tralles, and Rome. In the town of Troas, he 
wrote three more letters, these to the churches in ancient Philadelphia (also 
called Ala@ehir, located in modern-day Turkey), Asia Minor, and Smyrna, as 
well as a letter to St. Polycarp. In Rome, he was fed to the lions.
His relics are housed at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, and he is represented as 
a bishop surrounded by lions.

Part II: Put to the Test 
St. Irenaeus
Smyrna, Asia Minor (AD 125–AD 202)
Patron: archdiocese of Mobile, Alabama
Feast day: June 28
Many of Irenaeus’s early writings attacked the Gnostic heresy, holding that 
only Catholic bishops, those in communion with the pope, could provide 
correct interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures. He hoped to counter the ill 
effects of Gnosticism and stress Christianity.
His writings include a famous five-volume series, On the Detection and 
Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis. He wrote quite extensively about the 
heresy of Gnosticism, pointing to the fact that it was a sect with very limited 
reaches in the Church. In other words, these so-called Gnostic Gospels were 
not universal in nature, like the four authentic Gospels, and were tied to a 
particular people, message, and time. At the same time, he emphasized the 
four authentic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
He was likely martyred in Lyon, France, in AD 202. Unfortunately, his relics 
were destroyed as a result of the Protestant revolt in the 16th century.
St. Januarius
Benevento, Italy (AD 275–AD 304)
Patron: Naples, blood banks, and against volcanic eruptions
Feast day: September 19
Januarius was a fourth-century bishop of Benevento, Italy, who lived and died 
during the reign of Emperor Diocletian. He was among a group of Christians 
arrested and taken to Pozzouli, a section of modern-day Naples, to be food 
for wild bears. The beasts wouldn’t touch the Christians, so the Christians 
were all beheaded by Roman authorities.
More interesting than Januarius’s life is what happened to him in death. At 
first, the relic of his head was left in Naples and the rest of his body was 
taken to Benevento, where he had served as bishop. Eleven hundred years 
later, in the 15th century, his head and body were reunited and placed in the 
Cathedral of Naples, and he was made patron of the city.

81
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
A phenomenon involving the saint’s blood has occurred since the 14th cen-
tury: When the relics of the saint and vials of his blood are brought in pro-
cession and unite, the blood liquefies. The liquefaction of the blood can take 
many forms: boiling, turning a bright crimson color, or turning sluggish and 
dull in color.
St. Januarius has specific days set aside in the Church year on which he is 
celebrated. September 19 is the day of his martyrdom, and the Saturday 
before the first Sunday of May memorializes the reunification of his relics. 
December 16 commemorates the aversion of the eruption of the Mt. Vesuvius 
volcano (he’s the patron saint against volcanic eruptions, because Naples 
exists in the shadow of Mt. Vesuvius, still a very active volcano).
St. John the Baptist
Palestine (5 BC–AD 30)
Patron: Baptism, converts, the Knights of Malta, lambs, and tailors; the 
dioceses of Charleston (South Carolina), Dodge City (Kansas), Paterson 
(New Jersey), Portland (Maine), and Savannah (Georgia); invoked against 
convulsions, epilepsy, spasms, and hail
Feast days: birth, June 24; beheading, August 29
John the Baptist is the cousin of the Lord Jesus and son of Zachary and 
Elizabeth, who was the cousin of the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to 
Jewish genealogy, he is from the line of Aaron. Zachary, a Jewish priest, was 
struck mute when he doubted the veracity of an angel’s news that his wife 
was pregnant. When the infant was born and Zachary was asked the infant’s 
name, his voice returned and he proclaimed the baby “John.”
 
When both Elizabeth and Mary were pregnant, Mary came to visit her cousin 
(see Figure 6-1 for an artist’s rendering of this event). John is said to have 
leapt inside his mother’s womb when he encountered Jesus in Mary’s womb. 
Those in the pro-life movement in the Catholic Church today look to the visita-
tion of Elizabeth and the meeting of John and Jesus in the wombs as an inspi-
ration for the sanctity of life beginning in the womb.
John started his ministry at the age of 27, living a penitential life in the desert. 
He preached of repentance and baptized many people in the River Jordan — 
a baptism that was different from that Sacrament of Baptism instituted by 
the Lord. The Lord’s Baptism is a purification of the body; the baptism per-
formed by John was a means of interior repentance.

John’s staunch preaching against vices and evil caught the ear of King Herod, 
who was living in sin with his brother’s wife, Herodias, who also happened 
to be his niece. John preached rather severely against this particular sin and 
was arrested. The king both feared and revered John but was not in favor of 
his preaching. Herod threw a party attended by many guests, and the king 
got drunk. Herodias’s daughter, Salome, performed an exotic dance that 
pleased the king so much he granted her anything she wanted. Salome con-
spired with her mother to silence John the Baptist, and so he was beheaded.
Today, the relics of St. John the Baptist are in Rome and Amiens, France. He’s 
often depicted in art clothed in a hair shirt ready to baptize, or with his sev-
ered head on a platter.
St. John Fisher
Beverley (Yorkshire, England) (1469–1535)
Beatified: 1886
Canonized: 1935
Patron: diocese of Rochester, New York
Feast day: June 22
John Fisher’s defense of the bonds of marriage and his refusal to dissolve 
that of King Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon were the ultimate reason he 
was put to death.

83
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
Henry wanted to divorce Catherine because she couldn’t produce a male 
heir, but that wasn’t a valid reason for annulment in the Catholic Church. 
Bishop John Fisher defended the marriage bond, and the case was eventually 
upheld by the Roman Rota, the highest court in the Church. Henry broke with 
the Catholic Church and named himself head of a new church. The bishops 
who were in their positions as a result of nepotism or other royal favors soon 
swore allegiance to the new church, but not to John Fisher. He swore alle-
giance to Henry as the king of England but not head of the church.
Bishop John Fisher was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, despite 
having once been chaplain to the king’s mother. He languished in prison for 
18 months until Pope Paul III appointed him a cardinal. That was the last 
straw for King Henry, who ordered Fisher to be beheaded for treason. His 
body was buried unceremoniously in a churchyard not far from the tower, 
but his head was placed on a stake on Tower Bridge to be viewed by the pop-
ulace. It was only removed two weeks later to make room for Thomas More’s 
head (see the Thomas More entry later in this chapter).
St. Lucy
Siracusa, Sicily (AD 283–AD 304)
Patron: Sicily and Syracuse (Siracusa), ailments, injuries, and eye cancer
Feast day: December 13
Lucy had devoted her life to Christ, but after her father’s death, her mother 
betrothed the girl to a rich pagan. She wanted to retain her consecration, but 
it took three years and an intercession from another Sicilian martyr, Agatha, 
to convince her mother to let her remain chaste.
Her fiancé was not pleased and accused her of being a Christian, and then 
turned her over to the Roman governor. The governor sentenced Lucy to a 
house of prostitution, but the Lord came to protect her. She was then tor-
tured by having her eyes plucked out. She eventually succumbed to the tor-
turous orders from the governor, but not before her eyesight was restored. 
Lucy’s name was added to the Roman Canon of the Mass.
St. Lucy, pictured in Figure 6-2, is often shown with two eyeballs on a plate, 
or, as in this rendering, two eyeballs on a spike, to indicate the horrible 
method of her martyrdom.
 
Lucy’s name means “way of light.” On the Julian calendar, which predates the 
Gregorian calendar, Lucy’s day of martyrdom, December 13, is the darkest day 
in the Northern Hemisphere.

St. Maximilian Kolbe
Poland (1894–1941)
Beatified: 1971
Canonized: 1982
Patron: prisoners, drug addicts, journalists
Feast day: August 14
Maximilian’s life was filled with strife. He was born in the section of Poland 
that was under enemy control of the Russians, and he died during the Nazi 
regime. His parents were industrious workers who faced many hardships: 
Many of Maximilian’s siblings died, and his father was hanged for working for 
independence. His mother eventually entered a Benedictine convent, and his 
surviving brother became a priest.
In 1907, Maximilian entered the Conventuals, a reform branch of the 
Franciscan Order, and he later went to the Pontifical Gregorian College in 
Rome. In Rome, he founded an organization to promote the Catholic Church, 
the Army of Mary.
Maximilian received another doctorate, this one in theology, from the 
Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure, and then returned to Poland to teach 
in a seminary. He later joined four other men on a missionary trip to Japan, 
where they founded a monastery and established a Catholic newspaper.

85
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
The Nazis were in power when he returned to Poland. Many congregations 
were shut down, Catholic presses came to a halt, and the infamous prison 
camps were filling up. Maximilian entered the Auschwitz death camp on May 
28, 1941, and ministered as a priest calmly and quietly to other inmates. He 
was beaten, starved, dehydrated, and eventually given a lethal drug.
St. Polycarp
Birthplace unknown (AD 69–AD 155)
Patron: people who suffer from earaches or dysentery
Feast day: February 23
Polycarp was a disciple of St. John, the Beloved Disciple, and was part of the 
apostolic fathers, those who were instructed firsthand by the Apostles. Soon 
after his conversion in AD 80, he became a priest and then Bishop of Smyrna, 
which is located in present-day Turkey.
Polycarp traveled to Rome to meet with the pope. There, he also met the 
great heretic — a teacher of false doctrines — Marcion, who was quite indig-
nant that Polycarp said anything to him. A new wave of Christian persecu-
tion welcomed Polycarp when he returned to Smyrna. He refused to worship 
the pagan Roman gods, partake in emperor worship, or offer incense to the 
pagan deities. He was arrested at the age of 86 and was burned to death.
St. Sebastian
Milan, Italy (AD 257–AD 288)
Patron: archers, athletes, bookbinders, gunsmiths, lace makers, police 
officers, soldiers, stonecutters, victims of arrow wounds, and victims of 
the plague
Feast day: January 20
Sebastian is commonly known by his means of death. According to pious 
tradition, he volunteered to become a soldier in Caesar’s army, specifically 
becoming a Praetorian Guard (the elite personal protectors of the emperor). 
He wanted to be close to the Christians awaiting martyrdom. It’s said that he 
would comfort them, give them courage, and properly bury them after death — 
an act punishable by his own death under orders of Emperor Diocletian.

86
Part II: Put to the Test 
Sebastian was brought to his execution site, tied to a stump, and shot with 
arrows. The soldiers left, believing him dead, but Irene, a pious woman, went 
to retrieve his body and found he was still alive. She nursed him back to 
health, and rather than flee, Sebastian returned to his post as a Praetorian 
Guard, which startled Caesar. Sebastian reproached Diocletian for persecut-
ing Christians and was sentenced to death by beating.
Sebastian was buried in a common catacomb that would later take his name. 
A magnificent basilica stands over the cemetery in his honor.
St. Thomas Becket
London, England (1118–1170)
Beatified: 1173
Canonized: 1174
Patron: secular (diocesan) clergy, Exeter College, and Portsmouth, 
England
Feast day: December 29
Thomas Becket was a loyal friend and supporter to King Henry II. As a sup-
porter, he worked tirelessly for the monarch; as a friend, he accompanied the 
king on hunting expeditions.
At the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry wanted Thomas to take 
over. Thomas warned the king that their relationship would change, but 
Henry was too intent on controlling the Church with his friend to listen.
Conflicts arose, and Thomas sought to halt the king’s interference in Church 
matters, which didn’t sit well with Henry. On December 29, 1170, four knights 
set out for Canterbury seemingly under direction of the king. They tried to 
bring Thomas back to Winchester but killed him upon his refusal.
St. Thomas More
London, England (1478–1535)
Beatified: 1886
Canonized: 1935
Patron: lawyers and attorneys
Feast day: June 22

 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
Thomas More was a lawyer and writer who became a friend and personal 
adviser to King Henry VIII. Thomas was elected Speaker of the House of 
Commons in 1523 and, when the king was still Catholic, assisted him in writ-
ing the Defense of the Seven Sacraments. Henry made him the Chancellor of 
England from 1529 to 1532, a position that he ultimately resigned.
The men retained their friendship until Henry challenged the validity of his 
marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Thomas agreed with the presiding bishop 
that the bond was valid. When the Church in Rome also ruled that the mar-
riage was valid, Henry left the Church and set himself up as the Supreme 
Head of the Church of England, which denied the pope’s authority. To recog-
nize Henry as head of the church was against Thomas’s faith.
Thomas resigned his position and was imprisoned in the Tower of London 
and martyred for his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy. On July 6, 1535, 
he was beheaded and buried at the Tower of London. His head was placed on 
a lance to be viewed from the Tower Bridge.
Other Notable Martyrs
Not all martyrs’ stories are complete; in some cases, very little is known 
about them other than that they lived — and ultimately died — for their love 
of neighbor and love of God.
 
✓ St. Charles Lwanga and companions (1865–1886): Charles was from 
Uganda and was abused as a page as a young man. He became head of 
pages and wanted to protect other young pages, converting them to 
Catholicism. King Mwanga separated the Christians from the pagans and 
ordered them killed when they refused to renounce their faith.
 
✓ St. Cyprian (died AD 258): Cyprian was an excellent rhetorician before 
his conversion to Christianity. A highly educated man, he wrote many 
theological treatises. Christian persecutions were commonplace, and 
the Emperor Valerian started a new wave in AD 256, making martyrs of 
Pope Stephen I, Pope Sixtus II, and Pope St. Cornelius. Cyprian prepared 
the people of his diocese in Carthage, and he was arrested and put to 
death by the sword for refusing to offer sacrifice to pagan gods.
 
✓ First martyrs of the Church of Rome (died AD 64): The city of Rome 
was a blaze of fire in AD 64. Emperor Nero, seeing the charred remains, 
needed someone to blame. The emerging Christians, to Nero, were the 
perfect scapegoat. They were rounded up and put to death.
 
✓ Holy Innocents: The Holy Innocents are commemorated in Matthew 
2:16–18, in which the Evangelist recounts the anger of King Herod over 
the Magi not returning to reveal where the baby Jesus, the Messiah, 
was located. Herod ordered all boys 2 years old and younger to be 

88
Part II: Put to the Test 
massacred in Bethlehem and its environs (see the entry on the Blessed 
Virgin Mary in Chapter 2). The victims of this act of barbarism are con-
sidered to be the first martyrs for Christ. In the later part of the 20th 
century, the Holy Innocents came to be the patron saints of all the 
aborted babies in the world.
 
✓ St. Josaphat (1580–1623): Josaphat joined the Basilian Fathers (in 
Lithuania) and was ordained a priest in 1609. In 1617, he was ordained a 
bishop and was later made archbishop. He worked tirelessly to restore 
the Byzantine Catholic Church in areas that had gone over to the 
Orthodox Church, and in doing so, he created enemies. Animosity and 
jealousy eventually led to his martyrdom in 1623.
 
✓ St. Lawrence of Rome (died AD 258): Lawrence was one of seven dea-
cons to serve the Church in the third century, protecting the goods and 
property. When a prefect from Rome came looking for the Church’s 
riches, Lawrence presented him with the elderly, needy, and sick, indi-
cating that they were the true riches. The prefect wasn’t amused, and 
Lawrence was sentenced to death by being grilled over a gridiron.
 
✓ SS. Marcellinus and Peter the Exorcist (died AD 304): Marcellinus 
and Peter were jailed for their positions in the Church — notably, 
Peter’s position as an exorcist (one who recites the exorcism prayer 
at Baptism). They are said to have converted the head jailer and his 
family, an act that so angered Emperor Diocletian that he ordered them 
beheaded.
 
✓ SS. Nereus and Achilleus (died AD 98): Nereus and Achilleus were 
brothers. They served as guards to the noblewoman, Domitilla, a niece 
to Emperor Domitian. Domitilla converted to Christianity and conse-
crated herself as a virgin to the Lord, and the brothers were baptized 
by St. Peter the Apostle. All three were arrested and sent to the island 
of Ponza in the Mediterranean Sea, near the island of Capri. Nereus and 
Achilleus were beheaded, and Domitilla was burned for her refusal to 
offer sacrifice to the pagan idols.
 
✓ St. Pancras (AD 290–AD 304): Pancras and his uncle, Dionysius, were 
beheaded for not offering worship to the pagan Roman gods and were 
buried in the catacombs, which later took Pancras’s name. In the sixth 
century, a basilica was built over the site, and the head of St. Pancras 
was placed in a splendid reliquary in the new basilica.
 
✓ SS. Paul Chong Hasang and Andrew Kim Taegon and companions 
(1793–1839): Paul and his friends were martyrs from Korea. Paul was a 
layperson who was very instrumental in getting more clergy into Korea. 
Andrew Kim was the first Korean-born Catholic priest. Catholics in 
Korea had to practice their faith secretly because the ruling dynasty per-
secuted Christians. Andrew was beheaded in 1846, along with hundreds 
of other Catholics.

89
 Chapter 6: Holy Martyrs 
 
✓ St. Paul Miki and companions (1562–1597): Paul was born to rich par-
ents in Japan, entered the Jesuit community, and was ordained a priest. 
Paul and other Catholics marched 600 miles to Nagasaki, where he was 
crucified.
 
✓ St. Peter Chanel (1803–1841): Peter, a Frenchman, was ordained in 
1827 and sent to a parish that fell into decline following the French 
Revolution. With papal approval, Peter and his companions were sent to 
the South Pacific. They were the first Catholic missionaries, specifically 
to the Futuna Islands. To the native king’s dismay, most of the island 
converted to Catholicism. The king ordered Peter to be killed.
 
✓ St. Stanislaus (1030–1079): Stanislaus was ordained a priest and later 
became Bishop of Krakow, Poland. He was well known for his eloquent 
preaching, generosity, and penitential living. Because of his strict disci-
pline and defense of morality, he came into conflict with King Boleslaus 
of Poland. The confrontation eventually led to Stanislaus being hacked 
to death while celebrating Mass.

Holy Virgins and Religious Women
In This Chapter 
▶ Meeting some remarkable nuns
▶ Discovering some selfless saints
You need only look to the Blessed Virgin Mary to begin to see the impor-
tant role that women have played throughout the formation of the 
Church. Some of these women didn’t necessarily die a martyr’s death, but 
they left a powerful legacy of holiness by setting an example with the way 
they lived their daily lives and in the influence they had on the faithful. 
In this chapter, you discover these special women of faith — wives and moth-
ers, married and single — who served as religious sisters and nuns.
St. Angela Merici
Italy (1474–1540)
Beatified: 1768
Canonized: 1807
Patroness: people with physical disabilities
Feast day: January 27
Despite having a difficult childhood — her parents died when she was 10 and 
her sister died after the two children had moved in with an uncle — Angela 
lived a life full of faith. When her sister died before a priest could administer 
the Anointing of the Sick (also known as the Last Rites), Angela was greatly 
distressed; that night her sister came to her in a dream, assuring Angela that 
she was in heaven and all was well. Angela’s worry and anxiety dissipated. 
Angela became a Franciscan Tertiary, or a Third Order Franciscan. In religious 
life, the First Order is made up of all the priests of a religious community; the 
Second Order are the cloistered nuns living in a monastery; and the Third 
Order includes those men and women who live outside, either in convents or

Part II: Put to the Test 
separately in their own residence. Members of the Third Order don’t take the 
solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but they do follow the spiri-
tuality of the whole order and often wear the religious garb. Angela wore the 
Franciscan habit but lived by herself.
Angela’s uncle died when she was 20, and she returned to the town in which 
she was born. Young women and girls there had little to no education and no 
religious formation. With the help of other women, namely widows and those 
who had never married, Angela worked to educate these ladies and teach 
them the apostolate. She later called her community the Ursulines. 
St. Bridget of Sweden
Sweden (1303–1373)
Canonized: 1391
Patroness: Sweden, widows
Feast day: July 23
Bridget became an orphan at age 12 and a wife at age 14. She was married for 
27 years and bore eight children, but she embraced a life of simplicity and 
penance when her husband died in 1344. She started having private visions 
and revelations from the Lord during her life of solitude. She founded the 
Brigittine Order (also called the Order of St. Savior) the same year her hus-
band died. The order included monastic women who lived lives of prayer and 
monks whose primary role was the spiritual care of the sisters. 
Bridget was also very outspoken and decried both secular and ecclesiastical 
corruption. She reprimanded kings and princes, exhorted popes and bish-
ops, and urged Pope Urban V and his successor, Gregory XI, to move back to 
Rome and abandon the papal exile in Avignon. 
St. Catherine of Genoa
Genoa, Italy (1447–1510)
Beatified: 1675
Canonized: 1737
Patroness: brides, childless couples
Feast day: September 15

93
 Chapter 7: Holy Virgins and Religious Women 
Denied entry into the convent at the age of 13, Catherine was forced into an 
arranged marriage three years later. The couple was childless and unhappy, 
but a revelation of God’s love for her made Catherine bring her husband to 
the Catholic faith. 
The couple lived a chaste marriage from then on and worked with the 
sick and poor until her husband’s death in 1497. Catherine then became a 
Franciscan Tertiary and survived a bout with the plague in 1493. 
St. Frances of Rome
Rome, Italy (1384–1440)
Canonized: 1608
Patroness: automobiles and auto drivers
Feast day: March 9
Frances was a young bride and mother, marrying at the age of 12 after her 
father denounced her desire to become a nun. The early years of her mar-
riage were hard on Frances, as she preferred prayer and penance over her 
husband’s parties and play. 
Frances and her sister-in-law snuck away daily to Mass, pledging to God that 
they would be dutiful wives despite their longing to work with the poor. 
Frances saw everyone — rich and poor, nobility and peasantry — as her 
equal, and thus was a positive influence on her peers. Other women of class 
and privilege turned to Frances for spiritual advice and support and often 
imitated her generosity to the poor, as well as her devotion to her husband 
and children. They also came to follow her in her faith and service to God. 
St. Frances of Rome is known as the patroness of automobiles and auto driv-
ers because of her love and enjoyment of taking carriage rides, as well as her 
ability to see her own guardian angel anytime she rode such a vehicle. On her 
feast day, priests and deacons bless cars.
St. Gertrude the Great
Saxony (1256–1302) 
Patroness: travelers, West Indies
Feast day: November 16

94
Part II: Put to the Test 
Gertrude showed a love of and hunger for her faith at a very early age, 
becoming well-versed in the Bible and demonstrating a voracious appetite for 
learning as much as she could as early as age 5. She was orphaned at that age 
and left at a Benedictine monastery. She started having visions of the Sacred 
Heart of Jesus at the age of 26 and would continue having these visions for 
the rest of her life. She also had glimpses of the souls in purgatory and was 
therefore known to ask for devotion to both. 
St. Hedwig
Silesia, Poland (1174–1243)
Canonized: 1267
Patroness: Brandenburg, Germany; Poland
Feast day: October 16
As Duchess of Silesia, Hedwig was very concerned about the establishment of 
new monasteries. She had been educated in one as a child and so she knew 
firsthand the intellectual, economic, and spiritual benefit of these institu-
tions. When her husband, the duke, died in 1238, she moved into a monastery 
in Trebnitz and gave most of her earthly possessions to the poor.
At the monastery, she wore a grey habit but wasn’t received into the order as 
religious so she could spend her revenues in charities. Her love for the poor 
and needy is her lasting legacy.
St. Jeanne Jugan
Britanny, France (1792–1879)
Beatified: 1982
Canonized: 2009
Feast day: August 30
Foundress of the Little Sisters of the Poor, St. Jeanne Jugan lived a simple, 
humble, obedient life. She grew up in post-revolutionary France, where anti-
clericalism and hatred for the Catholic Church were intense.
Her father was missing at sea and presumed dead when she was only 4 years 
old. Her mother took odd jobs sewing and knitting. As a teenager, Jeanne 
worked for wealthy women as a kitchen maid. One of her employers took her 

95
 Chapter 7: Holy Virgins and Religious Women 
along to visit the poor sections of town and give the locals food and clothing. 
That experience opened the door for Jeanne to see that Christ was calling her 
to serve the poor.
Jeanne and two other women got together in 1837 to establish a religious 
community of women, the Little Sisters of the Poor. She and her confreres 
went begging door-to-door for food and clothes to give to the poor.
As her community began to grow, however, Jeanne went through a trial many 
call a dry martyrdom. Ordinarily, a martyr is an innocent victim who is killed 
because of her faith. When someone is subjected to nonphysical suffering 
and persecution, there is no physical death, but the trial and ordeal are just 
as real. Hence, the term dry martyrdom refers to the absence of shedding 
blood, as happens with regular martyrs.
Jeanne’s dry martyrdom wasn’t her difficult childhood but the success of her 
religious order. An ambitious priest, Father le Pailleur, was giving spiritual 
direction to Jeanne and the other sisters. When her community had its first 
official elections in 1842, Jeanne was unanimously elected. Father le Pailleur, 
however, nullified the election and designated a much younger woman, Sister 
Marie Jamet, as the mother superior. 
Because she took a vow of obedience, Sister Jeanne never revealed the con-
spiracy that denied her of being the mother superior and also led to the false 
information that the priest had been the original founder.
Only after her death did Church authorities learn of the skulduggery commit-
ted by the ambitious Father le Pailleur. He was removed from office and cen-
sured, and the history of the community was amended to show that the real 
foundress had always been Jeanne Jugan. Jeanne took it all in stride, even to 
her death. Her community, the Little Sisters of the Poor, is in many places 
around the world doing the work she first began.
St. Juliana Falconieri
Florence, Italy (1270–1341)
Beatified: 1678
Canonized: 1737
Patroness: people who suffer from violent vomiting
Feast day: June 19

96
Part II: Put to the Test 
With strong influence from her uncle, Saint Alexis Falconieri, Juliana rejected 
an arranged marriage to live her life as a bride of Christ — a nun — becoming a 
Servite Sister at the age of 15. Her uncle was one of the founders of the Servite 
Order. 
Legend has it that, on her deathbed, Juliana was unable to receive the 
consecrated host because she had been so ill; instead, the priest laid a cor-
poral (square piece of white linen that priests place on altar upon which 
the chalice is put) on her chest and then placed the Host on top. When she 
died, the corporal disappeared and left a cross on the cloth where the Host 
had been. 
St. Margaret Mary Alacoque
Burgundy, France (1647–1690)
Beatified: 1864
Canonized: 1920
Patroness: polio victims, devotion to Sacred Heart of Jesus
Feast day: October 17
Margaret learned patient endurance and kept her faith during a five-year 
struggle with rheumatic fever that left her bedridden. Her love of Christ sus-
tained her through those trying times. 
Margaret chose religious life and in 1671 entered the Visitation convent at 
Paray-le-Monial. In her first two years, Margaret began experiencing divine 
revelations in which Christ called her his chosen instrument to spread devo-
tion to him. He instructed her to establish what would become known as the 
Nine Fridays and the Holy Hour and asked that she create the feast of the 
Sacred Heart. 
 
The Nine Fridays mark Christ’s desire to have the faithful voluntarily come to 
Mass and Holy Communion for nine consecutive first Fridays of the month. 
The Holy Hour is 60 minutes of prayer from 11 p.m. to midnight on the eve 
of the first Friday of every month to make reparations for the sadness Jesus 
endured when he was abandoned by his Apostles in his Agony. (See the 
nearby sidebar to find more about Jesus’s promises for those who followed 
these rituals.)

St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi
Florence, Italy (1566–1607)
Beatified: 1626
Canonized: 1669
Patroness: Naples
Feast day: May 25
Mary Magdalene de Pazzi was admitted into the Carmelite Order of Nuns in 
1582 and became horribly ill very early in her vocation. During her illness, 
she experienced religious ecstasies, supernatural phenomena in which the 
person feels immense joy and happiness because of the union she (or he) has 
with Jesus.
12 promises of Jesus to St. Margaret Mary
Margaret Mary Alacoque received a private 
revelation from Christ in 1675 where he asked 
her to spread devotion to his Sacred Heart. 
Anyone who participated in this devotion, 
according to the message she received, could 
count on these 12 promises from Our Lord:
 1. I will give them all the graces necessary for 
their state of life.
 2. I will establish peace in their families. 
 3. I will console them in all their troubles. 
 4. They shall find in My Heart an assured 
refuge during life and especially at the hour 
of their death. 
 5. I will pour abundant blessings on all their 
undertakings. 
 6. Sinners shall find in My Heart the source of 
an infinite ocean of mercy. 
 7. Tepid souls shall become fervent. 
 8. Fervent souls shall speedily rise to great 
perfection. 
 9. I will bless the homes where an image of 
My Heart shall be exposed and honored. 
 10. I will give to priests the power of touching 
the most hardened hearts. 
 11. Those who propagate this devotion shall 
have their names written in My Heart, never 
to be effaced. 
 12. The all-powerful love of My Heart will grant 
to all those who shall receive Communion 
on the First Friday of nine consecutive 
months the grace of final repentance; they 
shall not die under My displeasure, nor 
without receiving their Sacraments; My 
heart shall be their assured refuge at that 
last hour.

98
Part II: Put to the Test 
Mary was also blessed with the gift of prophesy and could read souls, so 
when people came to visit her, she immediately knew what spiritual state 
they were in and what advice she should give.
St. Mary had such a personal relationship with Christ that she often spoke to 
him as one would a longtime or childhood friend, often with a teasing note. 
For example, as she aged, other nuns occasionally heard her whispering to 
Our Lord that he needed to speak louder to her as her hearing was beginning 
to fade. 
St. Rose of Lima
Lima, Peru (1586–1617)
Beatified: 1667
Canonized: 1671
Patroness: the Americas
Feast day: August 30
Rose (see Figure 7-1 for her portrait) took on personal penances for the spiri-
tual welfare of others, such as fasting outside of Lent and sleeping on the floor. 
At the age of 20, she became a Dominican nun and spent the rest of her days 
caring for the poor and destitute. She was so popular among the people for her 
sanctity and holiness that the pope named her patroness of the Americas.

Part III
Living the Faith

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we look at the early days of the religious 
communities. The founding mothers and fathers of 
these groups established orders and congregations often 
named after them — like St. Clare and her Poor Clares, St. 
Dominic and the Dominicans, St. Francis and the 
Franciscans, St. Benedict and the Benedictines, and so on.
We also look down the halls of the aristocracy at saints 
who were noble if not actual royalty, such as St. Louis of 
France, St. Margaret of Scotland, and St. Edward the 
Confessor. We introduce pioneer saints who brought the 
Catholic faith to the New World, and we discuss those holy 
men who rose to the highest level of Church leadership — 
the saintly popes. Though Church history admits the 
existence of at least a dozen bad (if not rotten) popes who 
brought great scandal, three times as many good and holy 
popes surpassed their colleagues in sanctity. 
Finally, we look at the saints of the Orthodox Church in 
America. Catholicism isn’t the only religion that honors 
saints; so do our Eastern brethren.

Chapter 8
Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the popes great enough to be deemed saints
▶ Finding out about saintly popes of the early Catholic Church
T
he supreme head of the Catholic Church is the pope, from the Italian 
“papa,” or “father.” Every Bishop of Rome has been the pope, and every 
pope has been the Bishop of Rome. Most popes lived in Rome; those who 
didn’t physically live there still served as Bishop of Rome, even if by long 
distance.
In this chapter, we introduce those popes who’ve been canonized as saints 
and briefly describe what’s known of their earthly service. We’ve listed the 
popes in chronological order for easier reference and provided the dates of 
their pontificate (papacy) but not their birth, because ancient records didn’t 
keep birth information as accurately as ordination information. We don’t 
supply patronage information either, as none of these popes are listed as 
patron saints.
Pope St. Peter
Pontificate: AD 33–AD 64
Feast days: SS. Peter & Paul, June 29; Chair of St. Peter, February 22
Peter became head of the Church and leader of the Christians following 
Christ’s Resurrection and Ascension. As the premier pope of the Catholic 
Church, St. Peter set the stage for those to follow; every pope to serve after 
his reign is considered a successor to St. Peter and the Bishop of Rome 
(see the nearby sidebar, “Early Church hierarchy”). He established the first 
Christian community in the empire’s capital just before being martyred in AD 
64 (see Chapter 3 for more on Peter’s life and martyrdom).

102
Part III: Living the Faith 
Pope St. Linus
Pontificate: AD 64–AD 76
Feast day: September 23
Not much is known about Linus, but he is mentioned in the New Testament in 
St. Paul’s Epistle, 2 Timothy 4:21. He was likely made a bishop by Paul.
Linus, who was probably from Tuscany, was the second pope of the Church 
and the first successor to St. Peter. His name appears in the Roman Canon, 
the part of the Catholic Mass where the Last Supper is reenacted and the 
priest speaks the words of Christ over the bread and wine, changing them 
into the body and blood of Jesus. One authoritative source (Liber Pontificalis) 
states that Linus was buried next to his predecessor, St. Peter, the first pope, 
on Vatican Hill. Recent archeological research has cast some doubts on the 
remains currently identified as Linus, but his existence is not disputed.
Pope St. Clement I
Pontificate: AD 88–AD 97
Feast day: November 23
Clement, the fourth pope, is believed to have known Peter and Paul; his 
writings are a great resource for their preaching and teaching. Scholars 
also believe that Paul refers to Clement in Philippians 4:3. Clement was an 
Early Church hierarchy
The early Church’s leadership was a pyramid 
with bishops at the top. Bishops were suc-
cessors to the 12 Apostles. Priests were suc-
cessors to the 72 disciples. Deacons were the 
junior end of the clergy, ordained specifically 
for service to God’s people and to assist the 
local bishop. Today, the deacon serves in the 
local parish helping the priests.
Although Rome is the center of ecclesiasti-
cal authority, other prominent centers of 
Christendom include Jerusalem, Alexandria, 
Antioch (modern-day Antakya, Turkey), and 
Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). Each 
has its own bishop who’s considered a direct 
successor to one of the original Apostles. 
Where Rome has the successor to St. Peter, 
Constantinople has the successor to his 
brother, St. Andrew. The Bishop of Alexandria 
is the successor to St. Mark, and the Bishop of 
Jerusalem is the successor to St. James.

103
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
educated man who wrote numerous letters that still survive today — many 
of which were responses to requests to settle disputes. His decisions were 
sought because he was the successor to St. Peter, and as the Bishop of Rome, 
he was considered to have universal primacy.
Clement is venerated as a martyr, though no historical data can back this 
view. Like St. Linus, Clement’s name appears in the Canon of the Mass. 
He died in Crimea, but his remains were brought back to Rome and are 
enshrined at the minor basilica of St. Clement (Basilica di San Clemente al 
Laterano).
Pope St. Alexander I
Pontificate: AD 105–AD 115
Feast day: May 3
As with many of the early popes, we don’t know much about Alexander 
except for some minor liturgical additions he made, such as the blessing of 
holy water mixed with salt. He also encouraged the use of holy water in pri-
vate homes.
Some historians believe that Alexander was a martyr and died under 
Emperor Hadrian or even Trajan, but no documented record indicates this. 
He was martyred by decapitation and is buried on the Via Nomentana in 
Rome.
Pope St. Telesphorus
Pontificate: AD 125–AD 136
Feast day: January 5
St. Telesphorus instituted a 7-week fast to prepare for the solemnity of 
Easter, thereby laying the foundation for the modern-day season of Lent 
(although Lent today lasts only 40 days). He also established the practice 
of celebrating Easter only on a Sunday so as to commemorate the actual 
day of the week that Jesus rose from the dead. Previously, people had cel-
ebrated Easter three days after Passover, and so it didn’t always fall on a 
Sunday. Telesphorus was also the first pope to establish the Christmas mid-
night Mass. He was martyred for his faith and is buried near St. Peter in the 
Vatican.

104
Part III: Living the Faith 
Pope St. Hyginus
Pontificate: AD 136–AD 140
Feast day: January 11
St. Hyginus had talents in theology that were put to use against the heresy of 
Gnosticism during his reign. Gnosticism was the idea that salvation could be 
achieved only through secret knowledge. Followers also believed that human 
souls are prisoners in physical bodies. Only the invisible, spiritual realities 
are considered good, while anything visible and material is evil.
Gnosticism originated in Egypt, and some of its proponents came to Rome 
in the hopes of winning over converts. Hyginus successfully eliminated the 
threat from Rome, but Gnosticism wasn’t completely eradicated until the fifth 
century. Hyginus is buried near the tomb of St. Peter at the Vatican.
Pope St. Zephyrinus
Pontificate: AD 199–AD 217
Feast day: August 26
Zephyrinus, a Roman of modest means and humble beginnings, faced several 
heresies during his reign, including two that created a heavy burden for this 
pope: adoptionism (the idea that Christ only became divine upon his bap-
tism) and modalism (the idea that the Holy Father, the Resurrected Son, and 
the Holy Spirit are one entity rather than the Holy Trinity).
Zephyrinus is considered a dry martyr because, though he certainly suffered 
persecution, he may not have died a martyr’s death. He’s buried in a cem-
etery near the Catacombs of St. Callixtus in Rome.
Pope St. Callixtus I
Pontificate: AD 217–AD 222
Feast day: October 14
Callixtus I reigned much the same way he lived — surrounded by struggles 
and misfortune. He was a Roman from Trastevere, the son of Domitius. While 
a slave of Carpophorus, Callixtus was given care of a bank, but he lost the 
money and ran away. Historians believe that customers took advantage of his 
inexperience and good nature.

 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Callixtus was caught and sentenced to hard labor. He was released early for 
good behavior, only to be jailed again for fighting in a synagogue (most likely 
trying to recover the money he lost). He was sent to work in the mines of 
Sardinia but was again released at the request of the emperor’s mistress.
All we know of his papacy comes from his most vocal opponents and 
enemies. Tertullian and Hippolytus vigorously disagreed with Callixtus’s 
decision to allow former adulterers, and even murderers, to receive Holy 
Communion after performing some tough penance and showing full contri-
tion. They preferred the more strict response of total and perpetual excom-
munication for very grave sins. Callixtus’s view on the mercy of God and the 
use of the Sacrament of Penance (confession) prevailed, and his enemies are 
now remembered as heretics.
His relics are buried in the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Pope St. Pontian
Pontificate: AD 230–AD 235
Feast day: August 13
Pontian, a Roman by birth, held a synod (a meeting of clergy) in Rome in AD 
230 to condemn the heresy of origenism — the loose interpretation of scrip-
ture and subordination of the doctrine of the Trinity. He was exiled to Sardinia 
during the reign of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, who eagerly persecuted the 
Church. In most cases, being exiled was considered a death sentence.
Popular belief holds that Pontian abdicated his office so his nephew could 
be chosen as his successor. Buried in Sardinia, Pontian’s remains were later 
moved to a papal cemetery on the Appian Way known as the Catacombs of St. 
Callixtus. Later, his bones were moved again to the Vatican, with other popes.
Pope St. Fabian
Pontificate: AD 236–250
Feast day: January 20
Fabian was one of the few laymen to be elected pope. After his selection, he 
was ordained a deacon, and then a priest, and finally, Bishop of Rome. When 
Pope Anterus died, many notable candidates were considered to succeed 
him. The crowd saw a white dove alight upon Fabian’s head, almost like the 
scene from the Gospel when the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove. 

106
Part III: Living the Faith 
The crowd interpreted this as a sign from heaven and unanimously chose 
Fabian as the next Bishop of Rome and Pope of the Church.
Fabian ruled during the reign of Emperor Gordian III, a time of peace in which 
the Church was able to expand. He divided the diocese of Rome into seven 
sections, built churches, and expanded cemeteries. He was responsible for 
the return of the remains of both Pope Pontian and the reconciled anti-pope 
Hippolytus.
After Emperor Gordian’s rule, persecution once again threatened the 
Christian Church in Rome. Emperor Decius had Fabian imprisoned, and he 
died there in AD 250. Originally buried in the Catacombs of St. Callixtus, he 
was later moved to the Basilica of St. Sebastian.
Pope St. Cornelius
Pontificate: AD 251–AD 253
Feast day: September 16
Cornelius was a Roman priest when he was chosen to succeed Pope Fabian. 
He was displeased with confessors (priests and bishops who absolved the 
sins of contrite sinners via the sacrament of penance, also known as confes-
sion), whom he considered lax with allegedly repentant Christians — those 
who sought reconciliation with the Church after having denounced their faith 
during the Roman persecutions. At the same time, he rebuked the harshness 
of those who maintained that the lapsi (lapsed Christians) were unforgivable.
Cornelius believed that the mercy of God allowed the Church to forgive 
repentant sinners but that divine justice demanded a proper penance.
The persecution of Christians was renewed and Cornelius was exiled; he died 
pending his trial and is therefore considered a martyr. He’s buried in the 
Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Lucius I
Pontificate: AD 253–AD 254
Feast day: March 4
Lucius was born in Rome and served just 18 months as pope. Like Cornelius, 
he condemned those who refused reconciliation with repentant lapsi, 
because he believed any sin was forgivable as long as the person had true 
contrition and a sincere desire to avoid sin in the future.

107
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Lucius and other Christians were exiled by Emperor Gallus, but after Gallus’s 
death, his successor, Valerian, allowed Pope Lucius and other Christians to 
return to Rome after previously being exiled. Lucius died a natural death in 
AD 254 and is buried in the papal chambers of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Stephen I
Pontificate: AD 254–AD 257
Feast day: August 2
Stephen was a priest in Rome when he was elected pope and faced the issue 
of heretics conducting baptisms. Some claimed that heretics’ baptisms were 
invalid, while others maintained that the grace of the sacrament worked 
regardless of the spiritual state of the minister. Pope Stephen agreed with the 
latter position, and thus it became doctrine for the entire Church, angering 
some of his opponents.
St. Stephen is buried in the papal chapel of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Sixtus II
Pontificate: AD 257–AD 258
Feast day: August 6
Sixtus (also Xystus) was a Greek philosopher before he became pope in 
Rome. At the time, Emperor Valerian was vehemently anti-Christian and pro-
hibited worship, instead requiring Christians to participate in state religious 
ceremonies. In defiance, Sixtus II gathered the faithful in a cemetery for a 
mass of commemoration, for which he was arrested and beheaded.
Sixtus is buried in the papal section of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus, and his 
name appears in the Canon of the Mass.
Pope St. Dionysius
Pontificate: AD 259–AD 268
Feast day: December 26

108
Part III: Living the Faith 
Dionysius was elected Pope at a time when many priests were martyred and 
church property was confiscated. Dionysius exercised his papal authority in 
many different ways, first by settling disputes in theology over the Blessed 
Trinity, and then by reaffirming the Church’s teaching that the Sacrament of 
Baptism is received only once.
In areas of government, Dionysius was left with the restructuring of the 
Church in Rome after Emperor Valerian’s campaign of persecution. After 
the emperor’s son ascended the throne, church land and property were 
returned. Dionysius reorganized the property and revitalized the decimated 
clergy. He’s buried in the papal section of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Caius
Pontificate: AD 283–AD 296
Feast day: April 22
Caius insisted on maintaining the mandate that bishops first be ordained 
priests before being consecrated to the episcopacy, which some had tried to 
make optional. Although he was likely a relative of the Emperor Diocletian, 
Caius had to escape to caves and catacombs when the Diocletian persecution 
of Christians went into full swing. He’s buried in the new part of the papal 
cemetery in the Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Marcellinus
Pontificate: AD 296–AD 304
Feast day: June 2
Marcellinus is remembered along with St. Peter as an exorcist of Rome. 
Both men were beheaded under the particularly vicious reign of Emperor 
Diocletian and are remembered in the Roman Canon of the Mass. Marcellinus 
guided the church for eight years, between AD 296 and AD 304.
Marcellinus was originally buried in a private cemetery, but the Christian 
Emperor Constantine later translated his relics, built a church over them, 
and buried his own mother, St. Helena, in it as well. In the ninth century, por-
tions of the relics of both saints were gifted by the Holy See to monasteries in 
Germany. Miracles were attributed to the intercession of these saints during 
this last transfer.

109
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Pope St. Melchiades
Pontificate: AD 311–AD 314
Feast day: December 10
Melchiades was the first pope to see the end of Roman persecution of 
Christians. Constantine defeated Maxentius in AD 312, and the new emperor 
issued his famous Edict of Milan the following year, legalizing Christianity.
At the urging of his mother, St. Helena (a devout Christian), Constantine gave 
Melchiades and the Church many imperial estates, like the Lateran Palace 
(which became the Basilica of St. John Lateran, the pope’s actual cathedral) 
and Vatican Hill (where St. Peter’s Basilica is located and where the pope 
now lives and works every day).
Melchiades is buried in the papal chapel of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus.
Pope St. Sylvester I
Pontificate: AD 314–AD 355
Feast day: December 31
According to pious tradition, Emperor Constantine was miraculously cured 
of leprosy when he was baptized by Pope Sylvester after he had issued the 
Edict of Milan.
Two significant meetings took place during Sylvester’s reign: the Synod of 
Arles, which condemned the heresy of Donatism, and the Ecumenical Council 
of Nicea, which condemned the heresy of Arianism. The latter council also 
developed the formula creed recited in the Catholic Church, based on an ear-
lier creed of the Apostles.
On the Via Salaria he built a cemeterial church over the Catacomb of 
Priscilla. He is buried in this church.
Pope St. Julius I
Pontificate: AD 337–AD 352
Feast day: April 12

110
Part III: Living the Faith 
Julius had to deal with the problem of the Arian heresy (Arianism denies the 
divinity of Christ). So much of the Christian world came under the influence 
of this heresy that Catholic bishops were deposed from their dioceses. Julius 
convened a synod, which resulted in reaffirming the pope’s authority over 
questions of theology or governance in the Church.
Julius also built two churches in Rome that still stand today: St. Mary 
Trastevere and The Church of the Holy Apostles.
Pope St. Damasus
Pontificate: AD 366–AD 384
Feast day: December 11
Damasus’s papacy was filled with heresies and political strife. He worked 
with St. Basil in the Eastern Church to enforce the documents of the Council 
of Nicea in Antioch, which at the time was divided between two bishops. 
He was also a productive laborer, working alongside St. Jerome in the Latin 
Vulgate translation of the Gospels, building a number of churches in Rome, 
restoring the catacombs, and refurbishing older places of worship. He wrote 
a treatise on virginity and poems on the Roman martyrs and popes. He’s 
buried in one of the churches he built in Rome, St. Lorenzo in Damaso.
Pope St. Siricius
Pontificate: AD 384–AD 399
Feast day: November 26
Siricius was the first pope to mandate celibacy in the Latin Church. (Eastern 
Catholic clergy were always given the option of marriage or celibacy before 
ordination). Even where married clergy were permitted, only celibates could 
be promoted. Siricius also condemned a heresy that attacked the veracity 
and necessity of the perpetual virginity of Mary. He’s buried in the Catacomb 
of Priscilla.
Pope St. Innocent I
Pontificate: AD 401–AD 417
Feast day: July 28

111
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Innocent stressed that dioceses should refer all major problems to the 
Bishop of Rome, as the pope is the supreme pastor of the universal church. 
A common expression was coined in this era: Roma locuta est, causa finita est 
(Rome has spoken, and the case is closed).
Innocent is buried next to his father, Pope Anastasius I, whose papacy ended 
prior to the celibacy mandate.
Pope St. Boniface I
Pontificate: AD 418–AD 422
Feast day: September 4
Boniface has earned much recognition for his efforts to strengthen the 
papacy. He was an old man when elected pope, and some of his dissidents 
seized the Lateran Palace and elected their own anti-pope, Eulalius. Emperor 
Honorius initially tried to sort out the situation, and for a while, he asked 
both men to suspend their rule. Boniface complied; Eulalius did not. The 
emperor and those in government were angered by Eulalius’s disobedience 
and unanimously recognized Boniface I as the authentic pope.
Boniface I also battled heresy and, along with St. Augustine of North Africa, 
was a champion supporter of orthodoxy. He is buried in the cemetery of 
Maximus on the Via Salaria, Rome.
Pope St. Celestine I
Pontificate: AD 422–AD 432
Feast day: April 6
Much controversy existed in the Church at the time Celestine reigned, 
especially from North Africa. Two heresies, Pelagianism and Nestorianism, 
plagued orthodox theology. Pelagius denied the necessity of grace and held 
that human works alone could earn your way into heaven; Nestorius denied 
the divinity of Christ and the title of Mary the Mother of God.
With St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa, Celestine dealt with the 
heresies by convening a council in Rome that laid the groundwork for the 
great Ecumenical Council in Ephesus, which dealt with these heresies on an 
authoritative basis. At this council in Rome, Celestine asserted the primacy of 
Peter and his successors in the Church and in matters of faith and morals. He 
is buried in the Catacombs of Priscilla.

112
Part III: Living the Faith 
Pope St. Sixtus III
Pontificate: AD 432–AD 440
Feast day: March 28
Sixtus continued the condemnation of the heresies of Pelagianism and 
Nestorianism during his papacy, although his pastoral demeanor and patience 
led some to conclude erroneously that he had heretical sympathies with these 
two. In reality, he was just a kinder, gentler pope than his predecessors.
He enlarged the Basilica of St. Mary Major on Esquiline Hill in Rome, dedi-
cated St. Peter in Chains, and built a beautiful baptistery at the Basilica of St. 
John Lateran.
Pope St. Leo I
Pontificate: AD 440–AD 461
Feast day: April 11
Leo was a deacon under Pope Celestine I and Pope Sixtus III. Along with Pope 
Gregory and Pope Nicholas, he’s one of only three popes to be given the title 
“the Great.”
A learned, erudite, and accomplished orator, Leo dealt with heresies head-
on. Ninety-six of his sermons and 143 letters survive today that concern the 
major theological errors of Leo’s time.
Although he couldn’t attend the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (AD 451), 
he wrote a letter known as the “Tome of Pope St. Leo” that was so clear and 
well received that the council fathers said, “God has spoken to us through 
Peter and in the person of Leo, his successor.”
Historically, Leo is remembered as the one man in all of human history who 
was able to dissuade Attila the Hun from sacking Rome. As Attila prepared 
for war in his camp outside of Rome, Leo rode up on his horse, not in armor 
but wearing the ecclesiastical vestments of a bishop. Attila had great awe and 
respect for Leo after seeing such faith and courage in an old man.
Leo is buried in St. Peter’s Basilica.

113
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Pope St. Hilarius
Pontificate: AD 461–AD 468
Feast day: February 28
Hilarius narrowly escaped death at the “Robber Council” of Ephesus (AD 
449), and, when he was elected pope, he showed his gratitude by building 
a chapel of St. John the Apostle in the baptistery of the Basilica of St. John 
Lateran. Centralizing the papacy’s authority in France and Spain proved to be 
a hallmark in his reign. He is buried at St. Lorenzo Fuori le Mura.
Pope St. Gelasius I
Pontificate: AD 492–AD 496
Feast day: November 21
Gelasius was the first pope to use the title “Vicar of Christ.” He also created 
a fourfold division of church donations and offerings. One part went to the 
poor, another to upkeep of the local parish, one portion to the bishop, and 
the fourth to the minor clergy.
Gelasius was an educated man and left a great depository of writings, ranging 
from theological letters and treatises to additions to the Roman Missal. He is 
buried in St. Peter’s Basilica.
Pope St. John I
Pontificate: AD 523–AD 526
Feast day: May 27
John was used as a pawn of sorts by Theodoric, the king of Italy, in an effort 
to mitigate the persecution and exile of Arian heretics. Emperor Justin I, a 
champion of orthodoxy, sought to root out the last vestiges of Arianism, but 
Theodoric, an Arian sympathizer, wanted John to intervene. One thing the 
pope didn’t agree to was a concession to allow once-converted Arian heretics 
to return to their old ways.
That concession aside, the pope did go to Constantinople to temper the 
passion of the emperor. This was the first trip that any pope commenced to 
the capital of Byzantium. The results were bittersweet — the trip was quite 

114
Part III: Living the Faith 
successful in that the emperor received the pope with great joy and enthu-
siasm; on the other hand, when Pope John returned to Italy he was impris-
oned by the mad king. He died in prison in AD 526.
Pope St. Felix III (IV)
Pontificate: AD 526–AD 530
Feast day: September 22
This Felix was concerned with heresies, particularly in France, where practi-
tioners were following teachings that denied the workings of grace and free 
will. The pope reaffirmed the teachings of St. Augustine, who had dealt with 
this issue in North Africa a century earlier.
Felix was a good steward of the Church: He increased its funds and church 
property, converted pagan temples back into churches (including pagan 
temples in the Roman Forum, two of which he converted into Christian 
basilicas of SS. Cosmas and Damian), presided over numerous ordinations 
to the priesthood, and performed many charitable works. Known as a man 
of simplicity, humility, and charity, he was also a staunch defender of 
the faith.
He decreed that clerics were under ecclesiastical jurisdiction, not civil, and 
that only Church courts could try accused clergy and impose sentencing.
Pope St. Agapetus I
Pontificate: AD 535–AD 536
Feast day: April 22
Agapetus was an archdeacon and somewhat elderly when chosen to be pope. 
He was a cultured and well-learned man who owned a vast library and who 
hoped to establish a university in Rome with the books he collected.
Although unsuccessful, the pope traveled from Rome to Constantinople to 
meet with Emperor Justinian in an effort to dissuade him from invading Italy. 
He died in Constantinople.

115
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Pope St. Gregory I
Pontificate: AD 590–AD 604
Feast day: September 3
Gregory was quite literally born into a saintly heritage. He was the grandson 
of Pope St. Felix III and the son of Gordianus, a wealthy patrician, and Silvia, 
who was also a saint. Gregory started his religious life as a monk and con-
verted the family villa in Rome to a monastery. His piety and monastic disci-
pline marked his spiritual life as pope.
When he assumed the papacy, Rome was in shambles from wars, invasions, 
earthquakes, fires, and abandonment by the empire. Rome went into a steady 
decline as power shifted to Constantinople. Pope Gregory served to help the 
material needs of the people he also led spiritually in the Eternal City.
He reorganized all the patrimony due to the Holy See from estates through-
out Italy; created the Gregory Missal, a compilation of changes in the 
traditional liturgy; and established the Gregorian chant musical style. He 
was a great supporter of missionary activity to England, where he sent St. 
Augustine of Canterbury and 49 missionaries. He is buried in St. Peter’s.
Pope St. Boniface IV
Pontificate: AD 608–AD 615
Feast day: May 8
Historians believe Pope Boniface worked closely with the great reforming 
pope Gregory I and was a champion of monasticism in the West. He was a 
member of the Benedictine Order.
He appointed the first Bishop of London and assembled a synod concerning 
monasticism, reforms that the bishop took back to England. The saintly pope 
was buried in the portico of St. Peter’s, and his relics were later translated 
into the interior of the church.
Pope St. Martin I
Pontificate: AD 649–AD 655
Feast day: November 12

116
Part III: Living the Faith 
Martin was a nuncio (papal ambassador) to Constantinople for Pope 
Theodore I before succeeding him in the papacy.
During his reign, Martin dealt with the heresy of Monothelitism — which 
denied that Christ had both a divine and a human will — and in so doing 
found himself in conflict with Emperor Constans II, who favored the 
Monothelists and silenced any opposition. Martin convened a council at the 
Lateran Palace, the official residence of the pope, in which Monothelitism 
was condemned, and appointed a vicar in the East to carry out his dictates, 
infuriating the emperor.
In retribution, the emperor sent a special dignitary to arrest the pope for high 
treason, but the representative converted upon seeing the pope’s popularity 
and the doctrine’s reasonableness. The emperor had to send another rep-
resentative to arrest Martin and bring him to Constantinople. The arduous 
journey to the seat of the Byzantine Empire was difficult for Martin, who was 
already in failing health. He was found guilty in a mock trial and sentenced to 
death, but later his sentence was commuted to banishment.
It wasn’t the humiliation or the terrible conditions of ill health that created 
Pope Martin I’s suffering; rather, it was that the people of Rome had forgotten 
him. Nobody attempted to help or rescue him, and the Romans had in fact 
elected another pope.
Martin died in exile in AD 655. In AD 680, the sixth general council ratified his 
teachings, and Martin was venerated as the last papal martyr. He is buried at 
St. Martin di Monti.
Pope St. Vitalian
Pontificate: AD 657–AD 672
Feast day: January 27
Like many of his predecessors, Vitalian was forced to confront 
Monothelitism, the denial of the two wills of Christ. Both the emperor and the 
Constantinople patriarch supported this denial.
The pope maintained the Roman position but let the argument remain idle 
for a time. The emperor bestowed gifts upon him, and the patriarch included 
his name in the Constantinople diptych. When the emperor visited Rome, 
Vitalian received him warmly and, in another diplomatic decision, passed 
over the emperor’s terrible treatment of his predecessor, Pope St. Martin I.
When the emperor was murdered in Sicily, Pope Vitalian backed the emperor’s 
son, the logical successor to the empire. The son wasn’t interested in doctrine, 
providing Vitalian an opportunity to come out with strong teachings against 

117
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Monothelitism. The Constantinople patriarch wasn’t amused and tried to 
remove his name diptych, but the new emperor, remembering Vitalian’s sup-
port, wouldn’t allow it.
Vitalian is buried in St. Peter’s Basilica.
Pope St. Agatho
Pontificate: AD 678–AD 681
Feast day: January 10
A Sicilian monk from Palermo, Agatho was married for 24 years before going 
into the monastery. He was instrumental in developing a friendly relationship 
between the Catholic Church and the Byzantine Empire. He convened a coun-
cil in Rome, attended by more than 150 bishops, that not only condemned 
the Monothelitism heresy but also reaffirmed the pope’s role as the custo-
dian of the true faith.
Another great filial concern was the church in England. He sent a special 
envoy from Rome to look after the emerging church in this area and to teach 
Roman liturgical norms and chants, at the same time keeping a closer eye 
on the emerging church. Agatho was a well-loved pope; he gave what little 
money he had to his clergy in Rome and endowed St. Mary Major, one of the 
four major basilicas.
Pope St. Sergius I
Pontificate: AD 687–AD 701
Feast day: September 8
Sergius, the son of a Syrian merchant, became pope under enormous 
controversy as anti-pope Paschal attempted to buy his way to the papacy 
through bribes. The influence of Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire 
were on the decline during Sergius’s papacy. The emperor called a council, to 
which the pope wasn’t invited, yet the emperor required him to sign the rules 
from the proceedings. Sergius refused, so the emperor sent troops to force 
the pope’s signature; the troops, however, supported the pope. The emperor 
was eventually deposed in Constantinople and sent into exile.
Sergius turned his attention toward the new church in England and tried 
to reinforce Roman Christianity’s foothold. He baptized the king of the 
Saxons, granting a pallium — sign of an archbishop — and thereby creating 
Canterbury and an archdiocese. In Rome, he restored, rebuilt, and enriched 

118
Part III: Living the Faith 
the basilicas of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Susana. He also established four 
feasts for the Blessed Virgin Mary: Annunciation, Assumption, Nativity, and 
Presentation. He is buried in St. Peter’s.
Pope St. Gregory II
Pontificate: AD 715–AD 731
Feast day: February 11
Gregory was born in Rome. He was a librarian for four popes and was known 
as a brilliant scholar, but he was perhaps best known for his defense of 
doctrine. Emperor Leo wanted church icons destroyed, making the Church 
appear more accessible to Jews and Muslims, who banned such images. 
When the decree reached Italy, Gregory immediately rejected it, reaffirming 
Catholic teaching that only idols (objects or images for worship of false gods) 
were prohibited. Sacred art depicting Jesus and the saints was a good thing. 
Most illiterate people learned the faith by looking at icons and stained glass 
windows, often called the poor man’s catechism.
Gregory also repaired the city walls and churches and opened institutions for 
the care of the elderly. He was a great supporter of monasticism: He turned 
his family estate into a monastery, restored the famous monastery of Monte 
Casino, and encouraged monastic vocations.
Pope St. Zacharias
Pontificate: AD 741–AD 752
Feast day: March 15
Zacharias, an Italian, was a learned man who knew how to read and write in 
Greek, skills that proved useful in dealing with the Byzantine emperor. At the 
time of his reign, the dispute over uses of sacred art and images still plagued 
the Church in the East; Zacharias, wise and diplomatic, cast the issue aside in 
favor of a better relationship with Constantinople.
Emperor Constantine V also put aside his religious differences and didn’t 
persecute the pope and the West for retaining sacred images in worship. The 
emperor needed the support of the pope in dealing with the Lombards, who 
wanted to invade Ravenna, the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy.

119
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Zacharias visited the king of the Lombards in a gesture of peace, forming a 
truce that resulted in the papal estates and political prisoners being returned 
to Rome. To the north, in the area of the Holy Roman Empire, the pope had 
excellent relations with the emperor and supported Boniface in his reign.
Pope St. Paul I
Pontificate: AD 757–AD 767
Feast day: June 28
Paul was the brother of Pope Stephen III and became his immediate succes-
sor in AD 757. He met the challenges of his time with diplomacy, fortitude, 
and at times clemency, granting his allegiance to the Holy Roman emperor 
upon coronation. King Pepin and the pope shared a favorable relationship in 
which recognition of the newly formed Papal States was solidified.
Unfortunately, his relationships with the Lombard king and the emperor of 
Constantinople were clouded by controversy over sacred images in churches 
and their use in worship. Paul I died at St. Paul’s Outside the Walls Basilica.
Pope St. Leo III
Pontificate: AD 795–AD 816
Feast day: June 12
Leo’s papacy was one of intrigue and slander, as a splinter group begrudged 
his election and sought to overturn it. First, they kidnapped and beat the 
pope to near death. When he recovered, the group brought false charges 
against him — charges serious enough that Charlemagne, king of the Franks, 
came to Rome to help defend Leo. The pope was cleared of all charges, and, 
on Christmas Day, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the peace-loving 
emperor of the Romans, commencing the Holy Roman Empire of the West.
Pope St. Paschal I
Pontificate: AD 817–AD 824
Feast day: February 12

120
Part III: Living the Faith 
Paschal’s papacy was plagued by intrigue, calumny, and disobedience. 
He was elected and consecrated pope immediately, not waiting for the 
approval of the Holy Roman emperor. The emperor was such a good friend of 
Paschal’s that he enacted a series of laws protecting the rights of the pope, 
the Papal States, and elections of future popes. The emperor’s son visited 
Rome after being granted co-rule of the empire and was crowned co-emperor 
by the pope. From that time on, Holy Roman emperors traveled to Rome for 
their coronation by the pope.
Calumny inundated the pope when his papal household was involved in foul 
play and the pope was accused of being involved in the plot. He took a pledge 
of innocence before bishops to prove his innocence; however, upon his 
death the old lies resurfaced, and the Romans barred his burial at St. Peter’s. 
Instead, he’s buried in one of the churches he built, St. Praxedis.
Pope St. Leo IV
Pontificate: AD 847–AD 855
Feast day: July 17
The major threat during Leo’s reign came from the Muslims, known as the 
Saracens, who attacked and destroyed cities up and down Italy’s coast. Pope 
Leo IV rebuilt the walls of Rome and added new walls around the Vatican. 
He aided the reconstruction of many destroyed churches and took care of 
those displaced by the Saracen invasions. Internally, he worked to improve 
his clergy’s moral status by adding several canons to Church law, reforming 
their education and discipline.
Pope St. Nicholas I
Pontificate: AD 858–AD 867
Feast day: November 13
When Nicholas assumed the papacy, the church was faced with many chal-
lenges, not the least of which was the fall of Charlemagne and the resulting 
division of the Holy Roman Empire. No central political power existed — 
bishops were appointed and deposed at the whim of local nobility.
Nicholas was a champion for the sacrament of marriage, making many deci-
sions regarding royal weddings that were being called into question. He also 
favored the freedom to marry over the veto powers of kings and fathers.

121
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
He ensured that food was prepared and delivered to poor invalids every 
day, setting aside substantial funds for their care and working to end their 
personal suffering. All these qualities made him one of the finest popes of his 
age and a true leader in the temporal and spiritual aspects of the Church — 
which the Church has recognized by designating him “Nicholas the Great,” 
one of only three popes to earn the title.
Pope St. Gregory VII
Pontificate: 1073–1085
Feast day: May 25
Gregory VII was one of the most powerful popes in history, remembered for 
vigorously defending the independence and autonomy of the Church from 
the secular authority of the kings and the Holy Roman emperor.
This period was a truly trying time for the Church. Of the secular rulers — 
William the Conqueror of England, Philip I of France, and Henry IV of 
Germany — Henry IV was the most tiresome. Gregory excommunicated 
him twice for his infidelity; Henry IV is believed to have supported an anti-
pope, or illegal rival pope.
Things inside the Church weren’t much better. Gregory VII was confronted 
with a range of problems, including clerical laxity and a decline of moral 
leadership. He ordered archbishops throughout the empire to come to Rome 
to receive the sign of their office, the pallium, in an effort to consolidate the 
authority of the Holy See. He died at the monastery in Monte Casino.
Pope St. Celestine V
Pontificate: 1294
Feast day: May 19
Born Pietro di Murrone, Celestine was a hermit, from the Abruzzi section of 
Italy. He was not well-schooled in theology, Latin, or diplomacy; and was an 
unlikely choice to become a successor of St. Peter. The fact that he was made 
pope is testament to the terrible state of the Church in the 13th century. The 
throne of St. Peter had been vacant for more than two years when Pietro di 
Morone exhorted the cardinals to put their differences aside and elect a pope.

122
Part III: Living the Faith 
The five months of his papacy proved difficult for the 85-year-old Celestine. 
The king of the Two Sicilies, Charles II, saw an opportunity to make poor 
Celestine a puppet to his wishes. Charles had the pope create 13 cardinals, 
many of whom were French, in a bid to secure the next election of the pope.
Devastated by these machinations, Celestine wanted to abdicate the throne 
of Peter, which was unprecedented. With the help of Cardinal Gaetani, who 
eventually succeeded him as Boniface VIII, Celestine laid aside his papal 
robes, begged the cardinals’ forgiveness, and returned to life as a hermit. 
Boniface VIII, worried that Celestine might be kidnapped and used to create 
a schism, kept Celestine a benign prisoner until the elderly hermit’s death. 
Boniface canonized him a saint in 1313.
Pope St. Pius V
Pontificate: 1566–1572
Feast day: April 30
Michele Ghisleri, who became Pius when elected pope, was a great reformer. 
He accepted the “shoes of the fisherman” at a time when the Church was suf-
fering from the Protestant revolt in most of Northern Europe. The Council of 
Trent had been convened before his papacy, and he implemented many of 
its reforms. He issued a new Roman Missal for Mass, the Roman Breviary — a 
scriptural prayer book for priests, and catechism — as the basis for other 
catechisms from children to adults, and a vernacular translation of the Bible. 
In addition, he enforced reform among bishops and priests, demanding that 
they live in the diocese and parish to which they were assigned; and he fought 
against simony (the buying and selling of ecclesiastical favors) and nepotism. 
These moves ushered in the age of the Counter-Reformation. Many new reli-
gious communities were formed, which helped create the armies of reform and 
bring back those souls lost to Catholicism.
As a politician, however, Pius V received mixed reviews. When monarchs, 
such as Queen Elizabeth I, left the Church and followed a new brand of reli-
gion, Pius excommunicated them. But the monarchs themselves were hardly 
affected. To the Catholics who remained in England, however, the excom-
munication proved disastrous. Those who remained in the faith were perse-
cuted; many were sentenced to death for “high treason.”
When it came to dealing with the Turks and the Muslim Ottoman Empire, 
however, the pope was more successful. The West united in the famous 
Battle of Lepanto, in which Christianity was victorious. Pius V saw the victory 
on October 7, 1571, as a gift from God through the intercession of the Blessed 
Virgin. He proclaimed a celebration known to this day as the Feast of Our 
Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. Originally, Pius V’s feast was observed on May 
5. In the new Roman calendar of 1969, it was moved to April 30.

123
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Pope St. Pius X
Pontificate: 1903–1914
Feast day: August 21
Another great reformer of the Church, Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, also took 
the name Pius at the start of his papacy.
Among his many reforms were his attempts to address the heresy of modern-
ism. In an encyclical 1907 letter, “Lamentabili,” he condemned 65 modernist 
propositions. He sought to renew Bible study and liturgical music, reform 
the Roman Missal, and renew the Code of Canon Law — the laws that govern 
Church practice. He renewed and revised seminary life and training, encour-
aged children to receive Holy Communion at the age of reason, and champi-
oned daily Communion for all.
St. Pius X condemned the secular French states for breaking with an earlier 
agreement in matters of property. He defended the rights of the downtrod-
den in Peru, Ireland, Poland, and Portugal. He sent many missionaries to the 
United States to help the newly established immigrant church. Some received 
miracles from God through the prayers of this kind, religiously devout, and 
charitable pope while he was alive.
Pope Pius XII canonized him a saint in 1954.
Other Saintly Popes of the 
Early Catholic Church
Details about many popes who served in the earliest days of the Catholic 
Church have been lost to the mists of time, yet they’re still considered saints. 
Here’s a brief recap of what we know about these holy men.
Pope St. Cletus (AD 76–AD 88): Born a Roman as Cletus, he was also known 
by his name in Greek, Anacletus. He’s listed in the Roman Canon of the Mass. 
His feast day is April 26.
Pope St. Evaristus (AD 97–AD 105): Evaristus, of Greek origin, was the fifth 
pope. He’s buried next to St. Peter in the Christian cemetery on Vatican Hill, 
the site of the 16th-century basilica. His feast day is October 26.
Pope St. Sixtus I (AD 115–AD 125): St. Sixtus reigned for ten years before 
meeting a martyr’s death. He’s believed to be buried near the site of the first-
century cemetery on Vatican Hill. He is remembered on April 3.

124
Part III: Living the Faith 
Pope St. Pius I (AD 140–AD 155): St. Pius I battled heretics that threatened 
the faith. So clear were Pope Pius I’s teaching and preaching that he won over 
converts, including St. Justin Martyr. His feast is celebrated on July 11.
Pope St. Anicetus (AD 155–AD 166): St. Anicetus hung out with some notable 
theologians, such as St. Polycarp of Smyrna and St. Justin Martyr. He’s most 
likely a martyr as well, even though no official details are known. His feast is 
on April 16.
Pope St. Soter (AD 166–AD 175): St. Soter introduced the solemnity of Easter 
as an annual celebration. Though no conclusive proof is available, he is tra-
ditionally considered a martyr and is remembered on April 22, along with 
another pope, St. Caius.
Pope St. Eleutherius (AD 175–AD 189): Eleutherius was a deacon in Rome 
before becoming a priest and then a bishop. He’s remembered for his 
declaration that anything suitable for human consumption is suitable for 
Christians to eat. His feast is on May 26.
Pope St. Victor (AD 189–AD 199): Victor so strongly believed that the 
Church should observe a uniform date for the solemnity of Easter that he 
excommunicated certain churches in the East who preferred their own calen-
dar and calculations. His feast is celebrated on July 28.
Pope St. Urban I (AD 222–AD 230): Urban reigned during the rule of Emperor 
Alexander Severus. Not much is known about him, other than the fact that 
he was a charitable and kind leader. He’s buried in the papal chapel of the 
Catacombs of St. Callixtus, and his feast is noted on May 25.
Pope St. Anterus (AD 235–AD 236): Anterus, a Greek, was responsible for 
creating the Acts of the Martyrs, a collection of biographies on the early 
Christian martyrs documenting when, where, and how they died. He was 
only pope for 43 days before being martyred himself by order of Emperor 
Maximinus Thrax; he was buried in the newly built papal chamber of the 
Catacombs of St. Callixtus. His feast is celebrated on January 3.
Pope St. Felix I (AD 268–AD 274): Felix ordered the celebration of Mass over 
the tombs of martyred Christians in the catacombs. His feast is May 30.
Pope St. Eutychian (AD 275–AD 283): Eutychian wasn’t martyred but has 
been considered a saint since antiquity. He reigned during a very peaceful 
respite between persecutions. He was the last pope to be buried in the papal 
chamber of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus. His feast day is December 7.
Pope St. Marcellus I (AD 308–AD 309): Marcellus wanted repentant lapsi 
to perform appropriate penances, an unpopular position that led to riots. 
Emperor Maxentius exiled Marcellus in an effort to calm down the populace. 
He died in AD 309 and is buried in the church named after him in Rome. His 
feast is memorialized on January 16.

125
 Chapter 8: Leading the Faithful: Saintly Popes
Pope St. Eusebius (AD 309): Eusebius sought substantial penances from 
repentant lapsi, leading Emperor Maxentius to exile him to Sicily, where he 
died. Eusebius’s body was transferred to Rome and buried in the Catacombs 
of St. Callixtus. His feast is celebrated on August 17.
Pope St. Mark (AD 336): Mark’s pontificate only lasted eight months, but he 
established two churches in Rome: one named after the evangelist Mark, cur-
rently incorporated in Palazzo di Venezia, and the second in the cemetery of 
St. Balbina, which has since been destroyed. Two important documents also 
came out of his pontificate: the Episcopal and Martyr Deposits, both of great 
historical value for the Church. His feast is recalled on October 7.
Pope St. Anastasius I (AD 399–AD 401): Anastasius settled theological con-
troversies concerning an early Church father of theology, Origen. Origen had 
many good theological points but had confusing ones as well. Anastasius 
had to clarify matters and condemn those parts that were heretical, which 
earned him praise from St. Jerome. Anastasius’s feast day is celebrated on 
December 19.
Pope St. Zosimus (AD 417–AD 418): In his short time as pope, Zosimus dealt 
with heresy and battled against episcopal intrigue and skulduggery surround-
ing imperial politics. Though not the most astute in areas of Church politics, 
he was a holy, kind, and charitable man. His feast is December 26.
Pope St. Simplicius (AD 468–AD 483): Simplicius saw the western Roman 
Emperor, Romulus Augustus, defeated by barbarian invaders, thus causing 
the city and empire to fall once and for all in AD 476. Pope Simplicius also 
had to deal with the usual heresies of the times. His feast is March 10.
Pope St. Felix II (III) (AD 483–AD 492): Some historians, to separate him 
from the anti-pope Felix II, list this pope as Felix III. He worked with the 
emperor to fight heresy throughout the empire. He’s buried at the Basilica of 
St. Paul Outside the Walls; his feast is March 1.
Pope St. Symmachus (AD 498–AD 514): Symmachus was archdeacon of 
the Eternal City (another name for Rome); his election to the papacy, how-
ever, was fraught with controversy as he faced struggles with the anti-pope 
Laurence. Symmachus embellished many churches throughout Rome and 
helped refugees in exile from heretical tyrants. He died on July 19 and is 
buried at St. Peter’s Basilica.
Pope St. Hormisdas (AD 514–AD 523): Not much is known about Hormisdas, 
who, like the first pope, St. Peter, had a wife. She died and left him a son, 
who later became Pope Silverius. Hormisdas compiled a confession of faith, 
Hormisdas Formula, allowing heretics to reenter the Church. His feast day is 
August 6.

126
Part III: Living the Faith 
Pope St. Silverius (AD 536–AD 537): Silverius was a subdeacon in Rome 
when elected pope. He was forced to abdicate his papacy in AD 537, falling 
victim to scheming by Empress Theodora, who wanted the pope to restore 
heretical leaders to their respective dioceses. When Silverius refused, the 
enraged empress plotted his downfall. He was reinstated to the throne of St. 
Peter by the emperor, who wasn’t aware of his wife’s skullduggery. Pope St. 
Silverius’s feast day is June 20.
Pope St. Adeodatus I (AD 615–AD 618): After more than 40 years as a priest, 
Adeodatus was elected to the papacy at a late age. He was the first pope 
to use lead seals on papal decrees (called bulls). In his will, he left a year’s 
salary to local clergy. His feast is November 8.
Pope St. Eugene I (AD 654–AD 657): Eugene was a priest in Rome when 
chosen pope and struggled with the emperor over Monothelitism. Unlike 
his predecessor, Pope Martin I, who openly condemned the Patriarch of 
Constantinople for his Monothelite opinions, Eugene chose to be more dip-
lomatic and tone down the rhetoric without denying the faith. He did refuse 
to sign a document that the patriarch sent to the pope, further confusing the 
issue of how many wills Christ had. The advancing Muslim troops against 
the Eastern Empire preoccupied the emperor and the patriarch, and Eugene 
was spared the humiliation and imprisonment suffered by his predecessor, 
Martin. He died in AD 657; his feast is June 2.
Pope St. Leo II (AD 682–AD 683): Leo II was an outstanding preacher who 
loved music but cared for the poor even more. The emperor often inter-
fered with Church policies, and this was the case in Leo’s election. It took 18 
months before the emperor gave his approval and Leo could go through the 
coronation ceremonies. The controversy centered on the sixth ecumenical 
council of Constantinople III (AD 680), which condemned both the heresy of 
Monothelitism and Pope Honorius I (accusing him of having heretical opin-
ions). Leo confirmed the condemnation of the heresy itself and of his prede-
cessor’s (Honorius) private opinions while making it clear that these theories 
never enjoyed formal approval. His feast is celebrated on July 3.
Pope St. Benedict II (AD 684–AD 685): When it came time for Benedict, pro-
ficient in both sacred music and Scripture, to be considered for the papacy, 
the Church of Rome still elected the popes, and they had to wait for imperial 
recognition before they could actually ascend the throne. Benedict got the 
emperor to agree to cede his approval authority to the local ruler in Italy, 
thus saving time between election and papal coronation. His feast is May 8.

Chapter 9
Founding Fathers and Mothers
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the founders of the Franciscans and Dominicans
▶ Checking out some other Church Fathers and Mothers
Just as a country honors its founding fathers and mothers, the Church 
honors the holy men and women who helped establish religious commu-
nities that have served the needs of many throughout the centuries. In this 
chapter, we look at the men and women who are considered the founders of 
various religious orders.
These founding fathers and mothers determined the name of the society 
they established as well as the charism, or spirit of the group. Even though 
a more formal name may have been used when these religious communities 
were created by their founders, many times the nickname of the organization 
comes from the personal name of the founding mother or father (Dominicans 
for the Order of Preachers; Franciscans for the Order of Friars Minor; 
Vincentians for the Congregation of the Mission; and so on).
St. Alphonsus Ligouri
Campania, Kingdom of Naples (current Italy) (1696–1787) 
Beatified: 1816
Canonized: 1839
Patron: moral theologians, ethicists, arthritis sufferers
Feast day: August 1
Alphonsus was something of a child prodigy, earning his doctorate in law by 
the age of 16 and having his own legal practice at age 21. Despite his legal 
prowess, however, just one significant loss forced Alphonsus to reassess his 
life choices and realize his true calling was the priesthood.

128
Part III: Living the Faith 
With his legal background and thinking style, Alphonsus was able to teach 
moral theology in a manner that was neither too lax nor too rigorous. His 
manuals in ethics have been considered classics for centuries, although he 
was met with some early opposition from those who considered him either 
too progressive or too reactionary.
Alphonsus was ordained in 1726, and in less than six years, he inaugurated a 
new religious community for men known as the Redemptorists after Our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ the Redeemer. The Congregation of the Most Holy 
Redeemer (CSsR from the Latin initials) was established as an order of mis-
sionary preachers who, to this day, are renowned for their eloquent homilies 
and sermons.
St. Augustine of Hippo
Algeria (AD 354–AD 430)
Patron: theology and philosophy professors, former playboys
Feast day: August 28
Augustine — the same man who would go on to establish a religious order 
of monks called the Augustinians — spent his early adult years in a life of 
debauchery and moral decadence. He immersed himself in a lifestyle filled 
with overindulgence and illicit pleasure, mimicking what was happening in 
the Roman Empire at the time. Once a stoic and respected empire, it had 
degenerated into rampant drunkenness, promiscuity, and hedonism. 
As the empire crumbled and barbarians raided and invaded the frontier 
and the capital, Augustine’s desire for ultimate pleasure at all costs began 
to wane. At the age of 18, he had already fathered a son out of wedlock, 
Adeodatus (meaning “gift from God”), but “the good life” took its toll, and 
Augustine began to yearn for something more substantial. He realized that a 
spiritual realm coexisted with the material world. 
Unfortunately, Augustine turned from his hedonistic lifestyle to dualism, or 
Manichaeism — the belief that anything physical is intrinsically evil, and only 
the purely immaterial is good. Instead of turning to religion as his mother, St. 
Monica, had prayed he would, Augustine adopted a Persian philosophy that 
viewed the battle of good and evil as being fought between the spiritual and 
material.
 
The book of Genesis tells us that God created both the spiritual and the mate-
rial and that it was “good.” Christianity takes this concept a step further: The 
doctrine of the Incarnation teaches that God took on a human nature in Jesus 
Christ. In other words, the pure spirit (God) took a physical body. How could 
this happen if the body were evil?

129
 Chapter 9: Founding Fathers and Mothers
St. Ambrose of Milan first broke through to Augustine, explaining that, while 
the world contains both good and evil, they are not equal forces. Evil is the 
absence of a good that ought to be present. A physical evil, for example, 
would be a violent hurricane that destroys a peaceful village. A moral evil is 
when a human being does something wrong instead of doing the right thing 
(like telling a lie rather than telling the truth).
Augustine pondered Ambrose’s words, and after much thought and prayer — 
and with the help of divine grace — he accepted the faith and became a 
believer. He and his son were baptized in AD 384 and became ardent Christians. 
Augustine became a staunch defender of the faith and used the philosophy of 
Plato to explain and defend Catholic doctrine. After the death of his beloved 
mother, he sold his possessions and founded the first monastery in the West. 
Augustine also fought the Pelagian heresy, a belief that any man or woman 
could get into heaven on his or her own merit, without the assistance of God. 
Augustine staunchly opposed Pelagianism and taught that any and all super-
natural good works are the result of divine grace. 
Augustine’s religious order was named after him, the Order of St. Augustine. 
The abbreviation OSA comes at the end of the name of an Augustinian monk — 
for example, Rev. Dudley Day, OSA. Augustine initially intended to live the l
ife of a hermit — one of solitude and little or no influence from the outside 
world — in an effort to escape the brutality of the Barbarians.
Augustine wrote Confessions, an autobiography in which he admits his wild, 
decadent youth and his imprudent overreaction in embracing dualism. He then 
explains that the Judeo-Christian religion is true because it’s rooted in reality; 
namely, that God created both the material and the immaterial, the physical 
and the spiritual. Either one can be abused and misused for nefarious pur-
poses, but good ultimately triumphs because it’s inherently superior to evil.
St. Benedict of Nursia
Cassino, Italy (AD 480–AD 543)
Canonized: 1220
Patron: Europe, poison victims
Feast day: July 11
In sharp contrast to St. Augustine’s early years, Benedict was turned off by 
the wild and rampant living taking place in Rome and fled to Subiaco, Italy, 
where he lived in a cave for three years. He later moved to the mountains 
of Monte Cassino, where he established a monastic way of life. He and his 
monks lived by the creed ora et labora, or “prayer and work,” which left him 

130
Part III: Living the Faith 
to divide his days equally between spiritual reflection and manual labor. 
At his monastery, the chapel bells rang every three hours to call the monks 
to prayer. 
Benedict offered stablility and guidance in the darkness of invasions and the 
collapse of Western civilization. His monasteries grew and spread quickly. 
Benedictine monasteries proliferated in Western Europe during the Middle 
Ages. The monks initially left the dangerous cities to live a life of simplicity, 
but after the Roman Empire fell (AD 476) and the barbarians became civi-
lized, the monks’ mission evolved into preserving the culture, art, literature, 
and education from antiquity. The monks not only preserved the Latin and 
Greek languages but also taught the former barbarians how to read and write. 
Eventually, people moved out of the old cities, and, over time, they built new 
ones surrounding the monks.
Benedict’s twin sister, Scholastica, established the female counterpart to 
her brother’s monastic order. Benedictine nuns operate much like their 
male contemporaries, also following the “ora et labora” way of life. Both men 
and women of the Benedictine order have the letters OSB after their proper 
names to designate that they’re members of the Order of St. Benedict. 
St. Clare of Assisi
Assisi, Italy (1194–1253)
Canonized: 1255
Patron: television, goldsmiths
Feast day: August 11 
When she was 18 years old, Clare heard a popular preacher, St. Francis of 
Assisi (see his entry later in this chapter), for the first time and was so moved 
that she immediately decided to found her own branch of religious women to 
be of spiritual support to the Franciscans.
Clare established the community of the Poor Ladies (now known as the Poor 
Clares) to meditate day and night and offer prayers for the Church. She was 
joined by her sister, Agnes, as well as many other women who lived in reli-
gious poverty, much like their Franciscan counterparts. With no money or 
land, they begged for their daily sustenance.
 
The Poor Clares are still active today, with likely the most active group in 
Alabama at Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) — the international 
Catholic media network that includes radio, Internet, shortwave radio, and 
satellite and cable television. 

131
 Chapter 9: Founding Fathers and Mothers
St. Dominic de Guzman
Calaruega, Province of Burgos, Kingdom of Castile (current Spain) 
(1170–1221)
Canonized: 1234
Patron: preachers, astonomers, the Dominican Republic
Feast day: August 8
The first vision to affect Dominic’s life happened before he was even born; 
while she was pregnant, Dominic’s mother had a vision of a dog with a 
torch in its mouth. The religious order Dominic would one day establish is 
called the Dominicans (Order of Friars Preachers) — domini cani, the Italian 
equivalent, means “hounds of the Lord,” a phrase used to describe steadfast 
preaching. 
Dominic was ordained a priest in 1194. By 1215, he formed his own religious 
community as a mendicant, or beggar, much like St. Francis of Assisi. The 
Dominicans, like the Franciscans, are technically not monks but friars, and 
they live in friaries, not monasteries.
Dominic’s greatest challenge was the Albigensian heresy. Similar to the 
Manichaeism and dualism that St. Augustine battled centuries before, 
Albigensianism held that Christ didn’t have a true human nature. These her-
etics believed that anything material or physical was intrinsically evil and 
that Jesus only pretended to have a real humanity along with his divinity. 
Creation was not good, according to the Albigensians, and Jesus was only 
divine and not human. 
Contemplating the mysteries of Jesus
With the aid of Rosary beads, the faithful 
contemplate 15 mysteries of Christ by pray-
ing 10 Hail Marys (Ave Marias), followed by 
an Our Father (Pater Noster) and a Glory Be 
(Gloria). During these prayers, the worshipper 
ponders the Joyful Mysteries (Annunciation, 
Visitation, Nativity, Presentation and Finding 
in the Temple), the Sorrowful Mysteries 
(Agony in the Garden, Scourging at the Pillar, 
Crowning of Thorns, Carrying of the Cross, 
Crucifixion and Death), and the Glorious 
Mysteries (Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, 
Assumption, Coronation).

132
Part III: Living the Faith 
Despite his eloquent preaching talent, Dominic was unable to dissuade the 
lay faithful in Spain and France from this growing heresy. Discouraged, he 
prayed for assistance, and the Virgin Mary gave him an answer. In a vision, 
he saw the Blessed Mother with the child Jesus, and she gave Dominic a 
Rosary (prayer beads). Since Hebrew times of the Old Testament, believers 
have used prayer beads to keep count when they pray the 150 Psalms as 
found in the Bible. Those same 150 beads could also be used to help defeat 
Albigensians, according to Dominic’s vision.
Common folk used prayer beads to pray the Psalms. St. Dominic asked them 
to use those same beads to think about the mysteries of Christ (see the 
nearby sidebar, “Contemplating the mysteries of Jesus”), which reveal both 
His humanity and His divinity. Only a man can suffer pain and death, yet only 
a god can rise from the dead and ascend into heaven. The spiritual “tool” of 
the Rosary worked, and the Albigensian heresy was defeated. The people 
embraced the orthodox teaching that Christ is true God and true Man, one 
divine person with two complete natures, human and divine.
St. Francis de Sales
Château de Thorens, Savoy, France (1567–1622) 
Beatified: 1662
Canonized: 1665
Patron: journalists
Feast day: January 24
Famous Dominicans
Pope St. Pius V was a Dominican before he 
became Pope in 1566. Until then, popes wore 
the red of the cardinal’s office they held before 
being elected Bishop of Rome and Successor 
of St. Peter. While some white was worn to dis-
tinguish the pope from other cardinals, it wasn’t 
until Pius V, a Dominican whose former habit 
was an all-white tunic, that the popes started 
wearing the now-familiar all-white cassock.
St. Albert the Great, the patron saint of scien-
tists, was another famous Dominican. He was 
the first to cross the bridge from alchemy to 
chemistry, and his thirst for scientific, philo-
sophical, and theological knowledge motivated 
his greatest student, St. Thomas Aquinas. Both 
of these Dominican saints lived in the 13th cen-
tury and left an invaluable legacy to their Order 
of Preachers.

133
 Chapter 9: Founding Fathers and Mothers
Francis was destined by his father to study law and enter into politics, but 
it was his Holy Father who calmed him during a stressful and overwhelming 
time, causing Francis to resign himself completely to the Divine Providence. 
He decided to become a priest and was ordained in Geneva in 1593. He was 
later named Bishop of Geneva and consecrated in 1602.
Francis established the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales (Oblati Sancti Francisci 
Salesii, O.S.F.S) to help promote the faith beyond the confines of the parish 
and diocese. The spirituality is based on Introduction to a Devout Life, a book 
Francis wrote for those struggling to become better Christians.
St. Francis also is one of the incorruptible saints; see his entry in Chapter 5.
St. Francis of Assisi
Assisi, Italy (1181–1226)
Canonized: 1228
Patron: animals, pet owners, veterinarians; San Francisco
Feast day: October 4
Francis — known now for his life of poverty and his work with the poor and 
needy — was once a spoiled young man who lived a life of ease, partying 
through the day and night and spending time with his friends.
Italy didn’t become a unified kingdom until the 19th century, so in Francis’s 
time, frequent battles took place between the cities and states. The people of 
Assisi and Perugia often were at battle; in one fight, Francis and his friends 
went to defend Assisi. The Perugians defeated Assisi, however, and Francis 
was jailed for a year. 
Francis became ill with fever while in jail and spent time in the infirmary, pro-
viding him with plenty of time to think of how he had wasted his life thus far. 
He decided to join the military and serve with honor when he was released 
and went to join Count Walter of Brienne. While traveling, he had a vision of 
the Lord saying to him, “Go, Francis, and repair my house, which as you see 
is falling into ruin.”
Francis misunderstood the Lord’s request. He ran to his father’s cloth shop 
and took the most expensive materials he could find. He sold the materials 
and his horse and took the money to the priest of a church in San Damiano 
that was in disrepair. Knowing that Francis had stolen the materials from his 
father, the priest refused the money. 

134
Part III: Living the Faith 
Francis’s father, Bernadone, was incensed when he learned what his son had 
done. His temper was so intense that Francis fled and hid in a cave in San 
Damiano for a month. He emerged dirty, unshaven, undernourished, and a 
general mess, making himself the subject of ridicule. His father dragged him 
home, beat him, and locked him in a closet. His mother helped him escape 
one day when his father was away on business.
Francis returned to the church in San Damiano and helped the priest there. 
When his father came looking for him, he told him: “Up to now I have called 
you my father on earth; henceforth I desire to say only ‘Our Father who art 
in Heaven.’” He then stripped himself of his clothes and handed them to his 
father, donning instead the clothing of a beggar. Over time, Francis acquired 
some companions who sought to rebuild the Church, and he realized what 
the Lord had meant: The Church he wanted Francis to rebuild was not the 
buildings but rather the people who came to worship in them. Francis real-
ized his mission was to preach spiritual renewal to the people of God. Pope 
Innocent III gave permission for him to establish a new religious commu-
nity, the Order of Friars Minor (OFM), which would later be known as the 
Franciscans.
Francis and the others took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. 
However, unlike the monks in the monasteries who also took a vow of stabil-
ity to live and die at that monastery, the Franciscans and their colleagues, the 
Dominicans, were mendicants; they begged for their sustenance, as they had 
no land and no money of their own. They literally had to live on the generos-
ity of others.
St. Francis is known as the patron saint of animals and animal lovers because 
he spent time in meditation outside and was sometimes found conversing 
with these creatures. He even befriended a wolf in Gubbio that had been bul-
lying the local villagers. He admonished the beast to behave, which the wolf 
did from then on. 
Francis also traveled to the Holy Land in an attempt to convert the Muslim 
Saracens and thus end the Crusades peacefully. He was unsuccessful in that 
specific goal, but he did secure the admiration of the Caliph, who ordered 
that certain Christian shrines in Jerusalem be placed in the care of the 
Franciscans — a role the Franciscans have carried out for centuries.
Well before his life ended, Francis was blessed with the gift of the stigmata, 
the manifestation of the five wounds of Jesus on the person without any 
physical harm (stigmata disappears immediately at death, however). Figure 
9-1 shows St. Francis with the stigmata on his hands, meditating on the 
Gospel while praying over a skull (a symbol of the dying self, or replacing the 
ego with the will of God).

St. Ignatius of Loyola
Loyola, Spain (1491–1556) 
Beatified: 1609
Canonized: 1622
Patron: military personnel
Feast day: July 31
Ignatius had long sought a soldier’s life, and in 1517, he entered the army and 
served in numerous campaigns with bravery and distinction. His life took a 
turn, however, when his leg was shattered by a cannonball in 1521.
Recuperation was long and painful, and Ignatius had little to do but read the 
Bible and the Lives of the Saints. Ignatius plowed through both, eventually 
determining that he shouldn’t be risking his life for an earthly king when the 
King of Kings promised him eternal life. Ignatius laid down his secular sword 
and became a “soldier for Christ,” allying himself with Jesus. He established 
a community of men he called the Society of Jesus, later to be known as the 
Jesuits (see Figure 9-2).
Ignatius saw the advantage of training men in all the classics of theology and 
philosophy, as well as geography, science, math, languages, and other humani-
ties. He planned to conquer error and heresy with truth and knowledge, which 

136
Part III: Living the Faith 
is why the Jesuits to this day are one of the most educated of religious commu-
nities. In addition to taking solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, 
Ignatius added a fourth vow, of complete service to the pope.
Popes in different times used the Jesuits and their growing influence to pro-
mote and defend the faith. Secular kings and princes, however, resented and 
envied the Jesuits’ success and finally pressured Rome to suppress the Order 
in 1767. Not until the Council of Vienna in 1814 after the Napoleonic Wars was 
the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) restored.

St. Lucy Filippini
Corneto, Tuscany, Italy (1672–1732) 
Beatified: 1926
Canonized: 1930
Patron: Catholic grammar schools
Feast day: March 25
After being orphaned as a young child, Lucy was taken under the wing of 
Cardinal Marc’Antonio Barbarigo, who inspired and protected her and 
encouraged her to work among the younger girls of the diocese. The Cardinal 
wanted Lucy to help make sure that the girls received a Christian education 
and upbringing.

137
 Chapter 9: Founding Fathers and Mothers
Lucy established the Religious Teachers Filippini in 1692 to educate and train 
religious women, who in turn taught the young, especially young women, to 
prepare them for life, whether they married or entered the convent. Boys 
commonly received instruction to prepare them to become priests or lay 
Christian gentlemen, but young women seldom received such spiritual and 
academic guidance. The Religious Teachers Filippini was established to give 
these young women the tools they needed to spiritually succeed.
St. Philip Neri
Florence, Italy (1515–1595) 
Beatified: 1615
Canonized: 1622
Patron: U.S. Special Forces
Feast day: May 26
Philip spent most of his life as a devout layman, only becoming ordained to 
the priesthood in 1551, when he was in his mid ‘30s. Until then, he studied 
and prayed and worked in the hospitals helping the sick.
He had a strong devotion to the Holy Eucharist and encouraged others to 
spend time in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. After he was ordained, 
Philip established the Congregation of the Oratory (CO) to help priests 
become holier and thus help their parishioners as well. 
St. Philip Neri’s oratories were and remain today an innovative creation: 
priests living together in a quasi-community but still working as typical 
parish priests. The fraternity and camaraderie, as well as spiritual support, is 
an attempt to compensate for what’s missing in most rectories (where most 
parish priests live). One of the most famous oratories is in London, England, 
where Cardinal Newman, the Anglican convert, spent his final years.
St. Vincent de Paul
France (1581–1660)
Beatified: 1729
Canonized: 1737
Patron: social workers, seminary professors
Feast day: September 27

138
Part III: Living the Faith 
Vincent de Paul’s priesthood got off to a somewhat turbulent start. Five years 
after being ordained, he was captured by Turkish pirates and held hostage 
for two years. He eventually converted his “owner” to Christianity and was 
granted freedom. He returned to Rome to expand his studies and eventually 
ended up in a wealthy parish in Paris.
In Paris, he befriended some affluent parishioners and convinced them to 
use their wealth to help the poor, one of two great needs he recognized in 
the early 17th century. The other great need he saw was the education of the 
clergy; poorly educated priests helped sow the seeds of the Reformation, 
and ignoring the plight of the poor was equally devastating to the church and 
society at large.
The Black Death (bubonic plague in 1348–1350) decimated a third of the 
population of Western Europe and killed two-thirds of the clergy. So desper-
ate were people for priests to administer the sacraments that sometimes 
uneducated and incompetent men were ordained, and their misbehavior and/
or unorthodox ideas made fertile ground for religious revolution. 
Vincent established the Congregation of the Mission (CM) to work on those 
two priorities: service to the poor and education of the clergy (seminary for-
mation). The Council of Trent had met from 1545–1563 in response to Martin 
Luther and the Protestant Reformation. One of the council’s decrees was the 
establishment of adequate seminaries to educate and supervise the forma-
tion of clergy to better serve the spiritual needs of the people in the parish.

St. Canute IV, King of Denmark
Denmark (1043–1086)
Canonized: 1101
Patron: Denmark
Feast day: January 19
Some historians believe that Canute was the illegitimate son of King Swein 
Estrithson of Denmark. He was the nephew of the king of England, and in 
1081, he succeeded his brother Harold as king of Denmark. He and his wife, 
Adela, had a son, Charles the Good.
As a ruler, Canute was dynamic both civilly and religiously. On the civil 
front, he consolidated much of the power under the king through owner-
ship of land, inheritance of possessions, and claiming booty from war and 
shipwrecks. In religion, he championed the rights of the poor, the vulnerable, 
orphans, and widows. He granted immunities and privileges to the clergy, 
and he commenced a rather ambitious building campaign in which many 
churches were built throughout the Danish kingdom.

140
Part III: Living the Faith 
One of his last campaigns was to reestablish his right to the throne in 
England. He assembled a navy and started an invasion of England, but 
he had to abandon the effort in Flanders. There, he sought exile with his 
brother Benedict in the Church of St. Alban, which he endowed with a relic 
of St. Alban that he had rescued from an earlier campaign in York, England. 
Huddled near the tabernacle in prayer, he confessed his sins, received 
Viaticum, and was martyred in the church sanctuary in 1086. His son Charles 
the Good, Count of Flanders, met a similar death in 1127 in Bruges.
Blessed Charlemagne 
(Charles the Great)
Germany (AD 742–AD 814)
Beatified: 1700s
Feast day: January 28
Charles was the eldest son of Pepin the Short — the king of the Franks — and 
Queen Bertha of Laon. His paternal grandfather was Charles Martel, who won 
the Battle of Tours in AD 732 and saved Europe from a Muslim invasion.
Charles saved Rome, the pope, and the Papal States when they were attacked 
by the Lombards. As a reward, Pope Leo III crowned Charles Holy Roman 
Emperor on Christmas Day, AD 800. From that point on, he was known as 
Carolus Magnus in Latin, or Charlemagne in French.
Under his reign, Charlemagne united Europe by supporting agricultural 
development and education and by codifying law. He was a devout Catholic 
Christian and sought to protect the unity and autonomy of the Church. 
During his reign, the notion of a unified Europe under one supreme secular 
ruler, or emperor, and one supreme spiritual ruler, or pope, first came to frui-
tion and was called Christendom.
Pope Benedict XIV beatified Charlemagne in the 1700s. The anti-pope, or false 
pope, Paschal III, had canonized him in 1165 in an attempt to appease the 
Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and thus be recognized as pope, 
but to no avail. No legitimate pope has canonized Charlemagne, although he 
remains beatified.

 Chapter 10: Ruling with Sanctity: Saints of Nobility
St. David of Scotland
Scotland (1085–1153)
Patron: Scotland
Feast day: May 24
David was the son of St. Margaret and King Malcolm of Scotland. In 1113, 
he married Countess Matilda of Huntingdon and was given the title Earl of 
Northampton.
David was known for his piety and love of the poor and as a devoted son of 
the Church. At one point, he asked the pope to promote the Catholic diocese 
of Glasgow to an archdiocese, which would free its ties with York, England. 
Though the Holy See didn’t grant this favor, David remained a staunch sup-
porter of the pope.
David succeeded to the Scottish throne in 1124. He was a good civil ruler 
who initiated reforms among the clergy and established abbeys, churches, 
and dioceses throughout Scotland. Because the monasteries were centers 
of learning, they helped to educate the Scots. In addition, the monks intro-
duced new agricultural methods that secured food and wealth for the people 
through the selling of crops to other European countries. Historians point 
to all these attributes as the turning point in Scottish history, when Scotland 
became a proper country.
St. Edward the Confessor
England (1003–1066)
Canonized: 1161
Patron: difficult marriages, monarchs of England, and separated spouses
Feast day: October 13
Edward was known to be a devoted man of God who never reproached even 
his enemies. On hunting trips that would take him away sometimes for days 
at a time, Edward took along his own chaplain and attended daily Mass.
Civil unrest in England led to Edward’s exile to Normandy for a time, and he 
wanted to travel to the tomb of St. Peter to atone for his sins. When he was 
no longer exiled, Edward built and endowed a special church in London in 
honor of St. Peter, known as Westminster Abbey.

142
Part III: Living the Faith 
The abbey was built with room for 70 monks, and Pope Nicholas II bestowed 
special privileges. After the Protestant Reformation took hold in England 
with the establishment of the Anglican Church, Queen Elizabeth I dissolved 
the monastery and made it one of her royal chapels. However, the throne on 
which Edward received his crown was preserved and can still be viewed in 
the monastery. Every king and queen of Great Britain has been crowned on 
the throne of St. Edward the Confessor.
Edward is buried in his beloved abbey. When his body was exhumed nearly 
100 years after his death, it was found to be incorrupt.
St. Elizabeth of Hungary
Hungary (1207–1231)
Canonized: 1235
Patron: bakers, beggars, brides, charitable societies and workers, charities, 
countesses, exiles, falsely accused people, homeless people, hospitals, 
lace makers, nursing homes, people ridiculed for their piety, and widows; 
invoked against death of children, in-law problems, and toothaches
Feast day: November 17
Elizabeth was the daughter of King Andrew and Queen Gertrude of Hungary. 
She was betrothed at the age of 4 to Hermann, the eldest son of Landgrave 
Hermann I of Thuringia. Her mother was murdered by Hungarian nobles in 
1213, and her fiancé Hermann died unexpectedly three years later. Elizabeth 
was then betrothed to Ludwig, the second son.
Ludwig and Elizabeth were married in 1221, when he was 21 and she was 14. 
They were happily married and had three children: Hermann, Sophia, and 
Gertrude, who was later beatified.
Elizabeth practiced the theological virtues throughout her marriage, par-
ticularly that of charity. She was known to help alleviate the suffering of the 
starving by selling her royal robes and jewelry in order to buy them food. 
When a great famine arose in the kingdom of what’s now Germany, Elizabeth 
felt compelled to do all she could to help.
She built and financially supported hospitals, one of which was at the foot of 
her residence, making it easier for her to attend to the needs of the sick on a 
daily basis. She cleaned, changed linens, and fed the patients.
Elizabeth joined the Third Order of St. Francis, a spirituality open to laity. 
Like the First and Second Orders — priests and nuns, respectively — the 
Third Order was designed to spread the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi 
among the people.

143
 Chapter 10: Ruling with Sanctity: Saints of Nobility
Ludwig, answering the call to crusade against the Ottoman Turks, contracted 
the plague and died just six years after he and Elizabeth were married. When 
Elizabeth learned of her husband’s death, she sank into a deep depression.
Pope Gregory IX appointed a royal defender, Father Conrad of Marburg, in 
the Duchy of Hesse, to oversee Elizabeth’s affairs. He was an exceptionally 
religious and zealous man. Under his direction, Elizabeth took vows like a reli-
gious nun. In his desire to have Elizabeth grow more spiritually with the Lord, 
he took every form of comfort away from her, including the warmth of her chil-
dren. Because of the harsh penances inflicted upon her and the rigorous life of 
charity she led, Elizabeth’s health began to fail, and she died at the age of 24.
St. Elizabeth of Portugal
Portugal (1271–1336)
Canonized: 1625
Patron: brides, charitable societies and workers, Coimbra (a city in 
Portugal), difficult marriages, falsely accused people, and peace; invoked 
against jealousy and in time of war
Feast day: July 4
Elizabeth was the daughter of King Pedro III and Queen Constantia of Aragon, 
great-granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, and great-niece 
of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, after whom she was named. Even as a young girl, 
she showed concern and compassion for the poor.
At the age of 12 she married King Denis (Diniz) of Portugal. He proved to be 
a good ruler but a bad husband, as Elizabeth suffered his abuse and infidel-
ity for many years. Her husband had such a jealous streak that he believed a 
lie that a court page told regarding an affair between Elizabeth and another 
page. The king ordered that the page he believed to be having the affair be 
killed, but through an error, the lying page was killed instead. King Denis real-
ized God had protected the innocent page and especially his innocent wife 
and queen, Elizabeth. He reformed his evil ways on the spot.
The royal couple had two children: Constance, who married the king of 
Castile; and Affonso IV, the heir to the throne. Unfortunately, the king had 
sired many other illegitimate children who contended for their father’s affec-
tion, if not his very throne.
The remaining years of Denis’s life were filled with sickness and a slow 
descent to death. Elizabeth stood by his side all day in his room whenever 
she wasn’t attending Mass. Her husband sought forgiveness for his infidelity 
and any cruelty imposed upon her from listening to gossip.

144
Part III: Living the Faith 
When Denis died, Elizabeth wanted to enter the Monastery of the Poor Clares 
that she founded in Coimbra, Portugal. She was dissuaded from entering 
strict cloister life, however, and instead took the habit of the Third Order of 
St. Francis and lived in a house near the monastery. In one of her last efforts 
at peacemaking, she went on a mission to stop a war between Portugal and 
Castile and was killed on July 4.
St. Helena of Constantinople
Nicomedia (in modern-day Turkey; AD 246–AD 330)
Patron: archeologists, converts, difficult marriages, divorced people, 
empresses, and the diocese of Helena, Montana
Feast day: August 18
Helena came from humble beginnings, but married a Roman general, 
Constantius I Chlorus, and they had a son, Constantine. The general was 
made Roman emperor in AD 293 and divorced Helena so he could marry the 
stepdaughter of the co-emperor, Maximian. Constantius died in AD 308, and 
Helena’s son Constantine became the emperor.
Upon his ascension to the imperial throne, Constantine proclaimed the 
Edict of Milan in AD 313, which legalized Christianity after three centuries of 
Roman persecution. It didn’t outlaw paganism, but it did remove the outlaw 
status Christians had been subjected to since the time of the Emperor Nero.
Although Constantine didn’t fully convert to Christianity until he was on his 
deathbed, he dearly loved his mother and provided her with every privilege 
and opportunity to promote the Christian religion.
Helena traveled to Palestine at age 80 on a pilgrimage to search for the his-
toric places in Christ’s early life. She went to the place of the Crucifixion on 
Calvary Hill in Jerusalem and found three remnants of crosses that had been 
used to crucify Roman prisoners. Helena brought a sick woman to touch the 
three pieces of wood, and only one — the true cross of Christ — provided an 
immediate and complete cure.
St. Helena had a church built on the very spot where Christ died where she 
enshrined some of the relics of the true cross. She sent other pieces to the 
pope in Rome and to her son, the emperor. She also established the Church 
in the Garden of Olives and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
She is enshrined at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.

St. Hedwig of Poland
Buda, Hungary (1374–1399)
Beatified: 1986
Canonized: 1997
Patron: Poland
Feast day: October 16
Hedwig was the youngest daughter of King Louis I of Hungary and Elizabeth 
of Bosnia and great-niece to King Casimir III of Poland. Upon Casimir’s death, 
Louis inherited the throne of Poland. When Louis died, Hedwig’s older sister, 
Mary, inherited the crown of Hungary while Hedwig inherited the throne of 
Poland. She was crowned in 1384 at the age of 10.
Hedwig was betrothed to Duke William of Austria, whom she loved, but the 
engagement was broken for a politically charged marriage to a pagan prince 
from Lithuania when she was 13. Hedwig offered up her disappointments 
and sufferings to Christ and was able to convert her husband, Jagiello, later 
known as King Landislaus II of Poland.
She was known for her charity to the sick and poor and for a revision of the 
laws to help the poor. She is buried at the cathedral in Kraków. 
St. Kenneth
Birthplace unknown (AD 525–AD 599) 
Patron: Wales
Feast day: August 1 
Kenneth (also known as Canicus, Canice, and Cenydd) was a prince of 
Brittany, the son of King Dihoc (Deroch) of Domnonée. He was born with hor-
rible deformities, and his pagan parents put him in a container and set him 
out to sea.
Kenneth washed up on the shores of Worms Head (in Wales) and survived, 
growing to be a Christian and a hermit. St. David of Wales met Kenneth and 
cured him of his birth defects. He is venerated almost exclusively in Wales.

St. Kenneth (Of Ireland)
Ireland (AD 515–AD 600)
Patron: Ireland
Feast day: October 11
A second St. Kenneth came from Ireland. Cainnech moccu Dalánn was the 
son of Lughadh Leithdhearg, a famous poet. He was ordained a priest and 
later become an abbot, or head of an abbey, in Clonard.
Kenneth didn’t stay long, however, for each time he established a monastery, 
he went on missionary journeys seeking to bring the Catholic faith to all parts 
of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. He was so successful that he is considered 
one of the twelve apostles of Ireland.
He also worked closely with St. Columba in Scotland and helped found many 
monasteries and abbeys there as well. St. Kenneth is well loved in both 
Scotland and Ireland to this very day.
St. Louis IX of France
Tunisia (1214–1270)
Canonized: 1297
Patron: Archdiocese of St. Louis, barbers, bridegrooms, builders, button 
makers, Congregation of the Sisters of St. Louis, construction workers, cru-
saders, distillers, French monarchs, masons, needleworkers, parenthood, 
prisoners, sculptors, and sick people; invoked against death of children
Feast day: August 25
Louis Capet was the son of King Louis VIII of France and Queen Blanche of 
Castile. His father died when he was 11, so his mother became queen-regent 
until Louis turned 22, at which time he became king of France and reigned 
for 44 years. He was 19 when he married Marguerite of Provence, with whom 
he had 11 children. This royal line continued until the last French monarch, 
Louis XVI, died during the Reign of Terror following the French Revolution.
Louis built the famous church of Sainte-Chapelle and reformed the amount 
that could be charged as interest on loans. He was a faithful servant of the 
pope, trying to stamp out religious heresy in his kingdom.
Louis organized crusades to rescue the Holy Land in 1245 and 1267. Neither 
was successful. In the first crusade, Louis was captured and eventually freed. 
During the second crusade, he became ill and died. His body was returned to 
Paris and interred in the Abbey of St. Denis.

A
s the U.S. and Canada were being colonized and settled, European 
rulers and religious leaders saw the need to form religious communities 
to help bring in schools, hospitals, orphanages, convents, and other social 
institutions. European countries often sent religious men and women on mis-
sions to North America to form these new communities.
In this chapter, we profile the saints who worked and died in the New World 
or who were born and raised on this continent. North America may not be 
able to claim as many saints as Europe, but like South America, Africa, and 
Asia, the numbers continue to increase as the faith spreads from generation 
to generation.
St. Damien of Molokai
Tremelo, Belgium (1840–1889)
Beatified: 1995
Canonized: 2009
Patron: Honolulu, Hawaii; victims of AIDS; victims of leprosy
Feast day: May 10
Jozef De Veuster was a young man in Belgium when he entered religious life 
and joined the Missionaries of Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Taking the 
name of Father Peter Damien, he was sent to Hawaii in 1864 to preach the 
Catholic faith to the native inhabitants.

148
Part III: Living the Faith 
While working in the Hawaiian Islands, Father Damien learned of the leper 
colony on Molokai, where anyone infected with the feared disease was imme-
diately quarantined. During the initial stages of the ailment, the victims took 
care of themselves, but when sores appeared and appendages began to fall 
off, even the government was afraid to get too close.
Six hundred people were confined to Molokai when Father Damien visited. 
He secured special permission from the bishop and in 1873 entered the 
leper colony as chaplain. He administered the sacraments, taught catechism, 
dressed their wounds, helped them build a place to live, made their coffins, 
and buried them when they died.
Father Damien was the only noninfected leper to voluntarily go and serve 
the spiritual and physical needs of that community. Eventually, however, he 
contracted the disease of leprosy himself in 1885 and died from the horrible 
ailment four years later.
When Pope Benedict XVI canonized Damien in 2009, a former resident of 
Hawaii expressed great admiration for the saint. U.S. President Barack 
Obama said:
Father Damien has also earned a special place in the hearts of Hawaiians. 
I recall many stories from my youth about his tireless work there to care for 
those suffering from leprosy who had been cast out. Following in the steps 
of Jesus’s ministry to the lepers, Father Damien challenged the stigmatizing 
effects of disease, giving voice to the voiceless and ultimately sacrificing his 
own life to bring dignity to so many.
 
St. Damien of Molokai remains a poignant example of Christian love of neigh-
bor. His life’s work exemplified the priceless value of every human being as 
being made in the image and likeness of God and the idea that all humans are 
worthy of respect and dignity. Pope Benedict reminded the crowds that saints 
like Damien remind us to treat the poor, the sick, the dying, the defenseless, 
and the oppressed with every ounce of charity and love we can muster.
St. Elizabeth Ann Seton
New York, NY (1774–1821)
Beatified: 1959
Canonized: 1975
Patron: Catholic schools
Feast day: January 4

149
 Chapter 11: North American Saints
Elizabeth Ann Seton’s life was marred by tragedy, disappointment, and aban-
donment, but she still grew to become the founder of women’s charities and 
a champion for poor and sick women and children.
Born Elizabeth Ann Bayley, she lived with her parents, distinguished French 
Huguenots of New York, and was raised in the Episcopal Church.
When Elizabeth’s mother died, her father remarried, and that marriage pro-
duced seven children. Elizabeth’s stepmother wasn’t fond of Elizabeth or her 
sister, and the two were sent to live with their paternal grandparents. The sep-
aration from her father was difficult for Elizabeth, and she became depressed.
Elizabeth (see Figure 11-1) married William Magee Seton when she was 
19, and the couple had five children: Anna Maria, William, Richard Bayley, 
Catherine Charlton, and Rebecca Mary. The family worshiped at the presti-
gious Trinity Episcopal Church on Wall Street. While at the church, Elizabeth 
established the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows and Small Children.
Elizabeth’s husband’s business eventually went bankrupt, and the family lost 
its fortune. William Seton developed tuberculosis, and one of his former busi-
ness acquaintances, Antonio Filicchi of Livomo, Italy, suggested the family 
travel to the warmth and sun of Italy to allow him to recuperate.
William was quarantined to the dark, dank ship, but Elizabeth and her eldest 
daughter went to stay with the Filicchi family. It was during that visit that 
Elizabeth was introduced to Catholicism. The Filicchi family was devout and 
zealous in their faith, and watching their intense piety started Elizabeth’s 
conversion.
When William died 30 days after their arrival in Italy, Elizabeth and her 
daughter returned to New York. Antonio Filicchi accompanied the two and 
continued to lead their Catholic instruction.
Elizabeth was met with hostility and animosity when she returned to New 
York, because of both her interest in Catholicism and her weakened financial 
position. It was her Catholic faith, still in its infancy, that carried her through 
those times. She converted to Catholicism on March 14, 1805, and was con-
firmed into the faith two weeks later.
Still needing to care for and support her five children, Elizabeth tried to 
establish a school, and later a boarding house for an Episcopal boys’ school, 
both of which failed because of the city’s anti-Catholic sentiments.
Elizabeth was invited to establish a school in Baltimore by the Rev. John 
Carroll, Bishop of Baltimore. She was also involved in the early stages of 
the first congregation for religious women in the U.S. with hopes that this 
congregation would eventually merge into the French community, the 
Daughters of Charity.

Part III: Living the Faith 
Elizabeth took vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience at St. Mary’s 
Seminary in Baltimore in 1809 and was given the title of Mother Seton. The 
habit she chose was that of a widow’s outfit.
 
That same year, she was asked to establish a school in Emmitsburg, Maryland, 
and this is where her community flourished with the rules of the Daughters of 
Charity. She eventually saw the creation of the first Catholic school in the U.S., 
and she was the first native-born citizen of the U.S. to be canonized.

St. Frances Xavier (Mother) Cabrini
Lombardy, Italy (1850–1917)
Beatified: 1938
Canonized: 1946
Patron: parish schools and religious education of youth
Feast day: November 13
St. Frances — born Maria Francesca in Sant’Angelo, Italy — became intro-
duced to religious life when a priest friend asked her to help reorganize a 
girls’ school that was being mismanaged by a woman who attempted to form 
a religious community. Though the original community had been suppressed, 
the bishop encouraged Maria to establish a missionary community with the 
young women she attracted.

151
 Chapter 11: North American Saints
The community flourished under Maria’s tutelage, and she finally took her 
formal religious vows in 1877, becoming Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini (see 
Figure 11-2). Her new community would come to be known as the Missionary 
Sisters of the Sacred Heart.
Pope Leo XII directed Mother Cabrini to take her community to the West, to 
aid the people who had migrated from Europe.
Mother Cabrini’s invitation was canceled when an original backer of a prom-
ised orphanage reneged. Not to be deterred, she pressed onward, and within 
36 days of her arrival, she had repaired the broken relationship with the 
backer and established the orphanage.
 
In the next 35 years, Mother Cabrini would go on to establish 67 institutions, 
including convents, orphanages, hospitals, and schools in the U.S., as well as 
similar institutions in Central and South America. She was the first naturalized 
citizen to be canonized.

St. John Neumann
Prachatitz, Bohemia (1811–1860)
Beatified: 1963
Canonized: 1977
Patron: immigrants, American bishops
Feast day: January 5

152
Part III: Living the Faith 
John Neumann was born under Austrian-Hungarian rule in Bohemia, the third 
of six children. He entered the seminary in Prague and received the minor 
orders of the priesthood. Because early 19th-century Bohemia had so many 
priests, John was always interested in doing missionary work in the U.S.
Many Germans were migrating to Pennsylvania and New York, and John 
made the journey to the U.S., stopping with papers in hand at the Archbishop 
of New York’s home. Within a few weeks, he was ordained to the major 
orders of sub-deacon, deacon, and priest.
John had a natural ability to learn language, a skill that helped him adapt to 
his new assignment in upstate New York: administering primarily to German 
and Irish immigrants. A serious illness, however, forced him to take some 
time to recuperate.
John eventually decided to enter the Congregation of the Most Holy 
Redeemer, or Redemptorists. He rose through the ranks and was named 
the order’s superior in the U.S. At the same time, he became pastor of St. 
Alphonse Church in Baltimore.
His organizational skills, perseverance, linguistic talents, and determination 
gained him notice, and he was suggested as the next Bishop of Philadelphia. 
Although he turned down the offer out of humility, his obedience ultimately 
led him to accept the command after being asked a second and third time.
Under John’s leadership, the diocese grew from having just two Catholic 
schools to more than a hundred. He also brought several religious communi-
ties of men and women to staff the schools, established a native order within 
the diocese (the Sisters of St. Francis), and administered the Oblate Sisters 
of St. Joseph in Baltimore for African-American women. Fifty churches were 
built within the diocese, which spanned from Philadelphia to New Jersey and 
included all of Delaware.
John also launched a devotion that remains popular in Philadelphia today, 
the 40 Hours Devotion, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed in the 
monstrance on the altar in the churches for all to see during that period.
John was also a prolific writer. He contributed articles to newspapers and 
wrote two catechisms: one for Germans and the second for the broader 
church. The latter catechism was suggested by the Eighth Council of 
Baltimore and served as the basis for the Baltimore Catechism, which was 
used by all parishes until the Second Vatican Council in 1965.
 
Bishop John Neumann was the first American bishop to be canonized a saint. 
The National Shrine of St. John Neumann is located in St. Peter’s Church on 
Fifth Street and Gerard Avenue in Philadelphia.

St. Katherine Drexel
Philadelphia, PA (1858–1955)
Beatified: 1988
Canonized: 2000
Patron: philanthropists, racial justice
Feast day: March 1
Katherine was a child of privilege who learned from her family that with 
financial security comes responsibility to those less fortunate. The second of 
two girls born to a wealthy, charitable banker, Katherine learned contempla-
tion and works of mercy from her father. Katherine’s mother died five weeks 
after her birth, and her father, Francis Drexel, remarried and the couple had 
a third daughter. Katherine’s stepmother, Emma Bouvier, continued the 
family’s charitable traditions and prayer, and soon the three girls became 
devoted to the poor.
Throughout her adolescence and young adulthood, Katherine longed to 
join a contemplative religious community, but her spiritual director, Bishop 
O’Connor, suggested she wait and pray. She became interested in the plight 
of poor Native Americans and African Americans and visited many reserva-
tions and enclaves of the poor.
During a visit with Pope Leo XIII, Katherine asked if he would send missionaries 
to America, and he suggested that she establish her own religious community.
To create a new community, Bishop O’Connor recommended Katherine 
enter the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh. She took the name Sister Mary 
Katherine, and her new religious community was called the Sisters of the 
Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, now simply the Sisters of 
the Blessed Sacrament. The community began attracting women to join and 
received canonical recognition during the reign of Pope St. Pius X.
With the help of her family’s money, Mother Katherine was able to establish 
many parochial schools, missions, convents, and trade schools for Native 
American and African Americans, including the prestigious Xavier University 
in New Orleans, the only Catholic university established for African 
Americans.
 
Katherine was canonized as the first American saint to have been born after 
the U.S. became a nation; when Elizabeth Ann Seton was born, the U.S. was 
still a colony of England, and Frances Xavier Cabrini became a U.S. citizen 
after immigrating from Italy in the 19th century.

154
Part III: Living the Faith 
Also of note: Mother Cabrini and Mother Drexel had a meeting in which 
Mother Cabrini passed along information for Mother Drexel to see the pope 
for canonical recognition of her order.
Katherine’s shrine is located at the motherhouse of the Sisters of the Blessed 
Sacrament in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.
St. Marguerite Bourgeoys
Troyes, France (1620–1700)
Beatified: 1950
Canonized: 1982
Patron: invoked against poverty and loss of parents
Feast day: January 12
Marguerite was one of 12 children born to devout Catholic parents in 17th-
century France. When her mother died, Marguerite was left to raise and 
educate her younger siblings, all the while dreaming of following a religious 
vocation. She was turned down by many orders, however, because of the 
high number of women seeking religious life at the time.
The governor of New France came to France seeking recruits for the new 
settlement, Ville Marie, which is now Montreal. Marguerite was introduced 
to Governor Maisonneuve and accepted the invitation to be a teacher in this 
new territory.
Marguerite accompanied many men and their prospective brides on the 
arduous journey to Quebec. She became friends with Jeanne Mance, and the 
two worked together in Ville Marie in what would become the foundation of a 
new community. They became known as the Congregation of Notre Dame of 
Montreal. Marguerite traveled to France three times seeking new recruits and 
a royal charter for her order. She returned with both.
In New France, however, the Bishop didn’t want this order to be on its own 
and preferred instead that it merge with the Ursuline Sisters in Quebec. 
Marguerite didn’t feel the two communities could merge because of a differ-
ence in spirituality: The Ursulines were primarily a cloistered community, 
and Marguerite’s order was to be among the people.
Marguerite’s order did eventually receive approval, and she retired as 
Mother Superior to live out her retirement in total prayer. Her shrine is 
located at Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secour Chapel in Montreal, Canada.

St. Marguerite d’Youville
Quebec, Canada (1701–1771)
Beatified: 1959
Canonized: 1990
Patron: widows and difficult marriages; invoked against the death of 
children
Feast day: October 16
Marguerite was left thousands of dollars in debt when she was widowed by 
her abusive alcoholic husband at the age of 29. She had buried four of her six 
children and was left to raise the two surviving boys on her own.
She opened a small shop where she made and sold clothing. Soon she had 
paid off all her husband’s debt and had even made enough money to get her 
sons a good education. Both boys eventually became priests.
Charity remained an important part of Marguerite’s life, and it wasn’t enough 
for her to donate money or to help the sick in hospitals. She opened a home 
for the poor and underprivileged in Montreal, attracting three other women 
to help in the mission.
Marguerite was met with suspicion and opposition, as women of society 
didn’t open their homes to become hostels for the poor. Already having to 
live with the reputation of having a drunken husband who was involved in 
illegal alcohol sales to the Native Americans, now Marguerite and her staff 
stood the ridicule of being called the “Tipsy Sisters” or Soeurs Grises, in 
Montreal’s native French.
With the help of a Sulpician priest, Marguerite and the others grew into 
a religious community known as the “Grey Nuns.” The sisters eventually 
adopted the rule of the Sisters of Charity and took over a failing hospital in 
Montreal that had tremendous debt. The sisters rebuilt the facility and paid 
off the debt.
Although Catholic persecution came about as part of the French and Indian 
War, Marguerite’s religious community thrived, spreading into the U.S., 
Africa, South America, and China. The communities helped staff hospitals, 
schools, and orphanages.

St. Rose Philippine Duschene
Grenoble, France (1769–1852)
Beatified: 1940
Canonized: 1988
Feast day: November 18
Rose was educated in the Convent of the Visitation Sisters, a religious order 
she had hoped to join, but because of the French Revolution in 1789, all 
Catholic institutions and religious orders were suppressed.
She returned home and did charitable work as a layperson until 1801, when 
the majority of Catholic organizations were allowed to reopen. Unfortunately, 
the Convent of the Visitation Sisters was not among them.
Rose met Mother Borat, a woman who had recently founded a new religious 
community, the Society of the Sacred Heart. Heeding the call of the American 
bishops, Rose went to New Orleans with four sisters from the order. Rose 
helped to establish schools, convents, and orphanages throughout the Missis-
sippi River Valley. She became the Mother Superior of the American branch of 
the Society of the Sacred Heart, and the community grew to have 64 women.
Mother Duschene eventually, at age 71, started a mission to the Native 
Americans, a dream she’d had since she was young. Though she was elderly 
and faced language barriers, Mother Duschene committed hours of her time 
in prayer for the Native Americans and the mission.
The North American (Canadian) 
Martyrs
(17th century)
Beatified: 1925
Canonized: 1930
Feast day: October 19
French settlers established a new colony in the 17th century in what is now 
Canada, particularly in the area of Quebec. The land was initially used for 
trading until French rulers decided to build permanent settlements. Religion 
became a major issue, and France, a Catholic country, sent missionaries from 
a variety of religious orders to establish schools, hospitals, orphanages, and 
other social services.

157
 Chapter 11: North American Saints
The native people were introduced to Christianity, and missionaries would 
often learn the language and translate the catechism and Bible. The natives 
in the vicinity of New France, however, were hostile not only to Europeans 
but to Christianity as well. It was under these circumstances that those now 
known as the North American martyrs entered New France.
Heroic figures such as Isaac Jogues, Jean de Brebeuf, and others influenced 
the Catholic Church in both Canada and the U.S., as part of their missionary 
activity and martyrdom took place in what is now upstate New York.
St. Isaac Jogues
Isaac was a Jesuit priest who worked among the Huron and Petun tribes in 
the Great Lakes area of New France. Living conditions weren’t good and dis-
ease was rampant. Tribe members blamed Europeans for unfamiliar illnesses, 
and the missionaries suffered much persecution. Isaac was captured by the 
Mohawk Indians and held as a captive slave for 13 months, during which time 
he was tortured and mutilated.
Father Jogues escaped while in a camp settlement near Albany, New York, 
and was sent back to France to recuperate. The pope gave him special per-
mission to celebrate Mass without the regulation fingers, as they had been 
amputated by the Indians. He recovered and returned to New France to con-
tinue his missionary work but was captured by the Iroquois and martyred 
alongside Father John de Brebeuf.
By 1650, the Iroquois exterminated the Huron tribe, which was becoming 
increasingly Christian. All 15 missions were consequently destroyed, yet 
the men and the many converts to Christianity left a lasting legacy in North 
America and left a mark for the future of the Catholic Church in the region. 
The feast day of these missionaries is observed on the Roman calendar on 
October 19. They are considered patron saints of the Americas and Canada.
St. John de Brebeuf
John became a member of the Jesuit order in 1617 at the age of 20. He con-
tracted tuberculosis early in his religious formation, and while it didn’t kill 
him, it left him incredibly weak and vulnerable to illness. He was ordained a 
priest in 1622 and volunteered to go to New France in 1625.
John lived among the friendly Huron Indians when he arrived in America. He 
mastered their language and customs and wrote a translation dictionary from 
French to Huron. He was expelled from the region during political battles, 
but he was able to return a few years later with the aid of more Jesuit men, 

158
Part III: Living the Faith 
including Father Anthony Daniels in 1632. In 1636, Fathers Isaac Jogues and 
Charles Garnier arrived in New France, followed by Fathers Noel Chabanel, 
Rene Goupil, and John de Lalande. Laymen came in 1643 and Father Gabriel 
Lalemant finally arrived in 1646.
The Huron and the Iroquois were often at war with each other, and working 
for one of the warring tribes could be fatal for the missionaries if they were 
captured. John composed a Huron catechism and help convert 7,000 people 
to the Catholic faith. He was eventually captured by the Iroquois and tor-
tured at Sainte Marie in Canada in 1649.
Father John’s companions were also subjected to Iroquois attack: Father 
Anthony Daniel also worked among the Huron, only to be killed by the 
Iroquois in 1648; Father Garnier was shot and died of a blow from a toma-
hawk; Father Lalemant was tortured to death; and Father Noel Chabanel 
was killed soon after by a member of the Huron tribe who turned against 
Christianity.
Companion martyrs
St. Isaac Jogues and St. John de Brebeuf were accompanied by six other Jesuit 
companions who were martyred during the same time frame (1642–1649): St. 
Antoine Daniel, St. Charles Garnier, St. Gabriel Lalemant, St. Jean de Lalande, 
St. Noël Chabanel, and St. René Goupil. Jogues and de Brebeuf are certainly 
the most famous of this group, but Pope Pius XI canonized all eight together in 
1930. All went to their deaths professing their faith in Christ and the Catholic 
Church, and all are honored to this day, not only by the Jesuit order to which 
they belonged but also by the faithful in Canada and upstate New York.
The Mexican Martyrs
Besides the martyrs of Canada and the U.S., other martyrs in North America 
came from or died in Mexico. During the early part of the 20th century, 
Mexico was undergoing turbulent and violent political change. After severing 
ties with Spain, the newly independent Mexican government became increas-
ingly anti-clerical and tried to control the Church, which led to a series of 
conflicts between the Church and the state.
Pope Pius X wrote a letter to the Mexican bishops warning of the terrible state 
of the Church in their country, and the bishops responded by suspending the 
Sacraments, including the celebration of Mass, for three years. It was their 
hope that the people of Mexico — the majority of whom were Catholic — 
would rise up against their government in support of their own rights. This act 
would come to be known as the Mexican Revolution of 1917.

159
 Chapter 11: North American Saints
As a result of the revolution, a severe persecution of the Church began and 
resulted in more than 125 martyrs, including laymen such as Manuel Morales, 
Salvador Puente, and David Lara. Clerical martyrs included Fathers Miguel 
Pro, Luis Sainz, David Bermudez, Crisobal Jara, Agustin Cortes, Jenaro 
Delgaldillo, Jesus Montoya, Jose Varela, Jose Hurtado, Julio Mendoza, David 
Velasco, Margarito Garcia, Pedro Ramirez, Rodrigo Aleman, Roman Rosales, 
Sabas Salazar, Toribio Gonzalez, Tranquilino Robles, Justino Madrigal, 
Atilono Alvarado, Miguel de la Mora, and Pedro de Jesus Lucero.
Blessed Miguel Pro
Miguel joined the Jesuits in 1911 and fled to Spain in 1914, where he contin-
ued his studies. He was ordained a priest in Belgium in 1925 and returned the 
following year to his native Mexico, where he had to celebrate Mass in secret 
because the government had closed the churches. He dressed as a layperson 
and worked secular jobs, using his time with the people to continue his 
evangelization.
The government grew weary of Father Pro’s success and blamed an attempt 
to kill the president on Father Pro and two of his brothers. They were 
arrested and ordered to be executed. Father Pro’s dying words were, “Long 
live Christ the King.”
Pope John Paul II beatified Father Pro and his companions in an outdoor 
Mass in Mexico on September 25, 1988. Father Pro’s feast is observed on 
November 23.
Pope John Paul II canonized an additional 25 men on May 21, 2000, including 
St. Jenaro Sanchez Delgadillo, a parish priest who, along with other parish-
ioners, was imprisoned and died by hanging; and St. Cristobal Jara, a devout 
parish priest who was shot to death on May 25, 1927.
Other notable clerical martyrs
Many other notable clerics gave their lives for the cause. Some of them include:
 
✓ St. Jose Maria Robles Hurtado, who, during his brief time as a priest, 
founded a community of women known as the Sisters of the Sacred 
Heart of Jesus. He wrote many articles on the Catholic faith and pro-
moted devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. He also was involved in the 
Catholic action movement known as Cristeros, or Christ the King. Father 
Hurtado started to erect a cross, and thousands of pilgrims traveled to 
be part of the groundbreaking ceremony. The construction was in direct 
opposition to the government ban on all public displays of religion. He 
was arrested and hung on June 26, 1927, which is also his feast day.

160
Part III: Living the Faith 
 
✓ St. Mateo Correa Magallanes was arrested for celebrating the Sacrament 
of the Sick for an elderly person. In prison, he administered to the mem-
bers of the Cristeros and heard confessions. Prison officials threatened 
to kill him unless he revealed the confessions. Father Magallanes refused 
and was shot to death on February 6, 1927. His feast is commemorated 
on May 21.
 
✓ St. Toribio Romo Gonzalez was a priest at the time parishes were being 
closed and he was forbidden to celebrate Mass and pray in public. 
Father Gonzalez set up a secret parish within a factory, but informants 
led government leaders to the parish, and Father Gonzalez was shot to 
death in bed on February 25, 1928. His feast is celebrated on May 25.
 
✓ St. Rafael Guizar Valencia became Bishop of Veracruz, Mexico, when 
he was in exile in Cuba. As bishop, he cared for the people during 
the Mexican Revolution and worked tirelessly for their cause. He was 
also an active member of the Knights of Columbus, a connection that 
enabled the American Knights of Columbus to get the American govern-
ment involved in a peace treaty between the Mexican government and 
the Church in 1929. He returned to Veracruz and administered to his 
diocese until his death in 1938. Pope Benedict XVI canonized him on 
October 15, 2006. His feast is commemorated on June 6.
St. Juan Diego
Mexico (1474–1548)
Beatified: 1990
Canonized: 2002
Patron: Mexicans of Native Indian (Aztec) descent
Feast day: December 9
Born with the name Cuauhtlatoatzin in 1474 to Aztec Indian parents, Juan 
Diego lived in the area that would one day encompass present-day Mexico 
City. He was a simple farmworker and a married man who didn’t have any 
children. He and his wife converted to Christianity when he was 50; he took 
the name Juan Diego and she became Maria Lucia. His wife died in 1529, and 
Juan Diego never remarried.
On a morning walk to church, he had a vision of Mary on Tepeyac Hill; she 
spoke to him and commanded that he ask the bishop to build a chapel in 
her honor on that very spot — a spot that, according to Aztec religion, was 
a place of worship for a pagan goddess. He believed God’s intention was to 
replace paganism with Christianity by making a shrine to the Mother of God.

161
 Chapter 11: North American Saints
When Juan approached the bishop, the bishop demanded a sign to prove 
that Juan indeed saw an apparition and hadn’t just imagined it.
When Juan Diego returned to his uncle’s home, he found him severely ill. 
Instead of following the bishop’s directives for a sign from the apparition, 
Juan searched for a priest to administer the Sacrament of the Sick to his 
uncle.
Mary appeared to Juan again and assured him his uncle would be fine and 
provided a sign for the bishop — roses, which didn’t grow on the hill because 
of the desert-like conditions of the area. Juan gathered the roses in his cloak 
and returned to the bishop. As the cloak was unfolded to reveal the roses, an 
image of Our Lady appeared, now known as the sacred image of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe.
The image was a rare picture of the Virgin Mary as a pregnant mother, but 
also with Native Indian features like those of Juan Diego and his family. All 
Christian art at that time portrayed the Blessed Mother, baby Jesus, and St. 
Joseph as if they were Western Europeans. Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of 
the few sacred images showing her in the form of an indigenous native.
Tests have been performed on the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe through 
the second half of the 20th century. The image hasn’t been painted, dyed, or 
sewn into the material of the cloak, and the colors have remained intact for 
more than 500 years. The image hangs in the basilica’s shrine.
St. Philip of Jesus and 
the Martyrs of Japan
Died: 1597
Beatified: 1627
Canonized: 1862
Feast day: February 5
St. Philip was a 16th-century Mexican priest who had joined the Franciscan 
Order. He was on a ship headed to the Philippines when a storm diverted it 
to Japan, where the government feared a foreign invasion. Earlier in the cen-
tury, St. Francis Xavier had established a successful Catholic church in Japan, 
and by the time of St. Philip’s arrival, Japan had more than 2,000 Christians.
The emperor became hostile to people of the West and their religion, and 
Christians were persecuted.

162
Part III: Living the Faith 
Philip and the other passengers were arrested, tortured, and paraded 
through town on the way to a hill outside of Nagasaki, where they were killed 
on February 5, 1597. There were 24 martyrs of Japan, including St. Peter 
Baptist, St. Martin De Aguire, St. Francis Blanco, and St. Francis of St. Michael, 
who were all Spaniards; St. Gonsalo Garcia, St. Paul Miki, St. John Goto, and 
St. James Kisai, and 17 others who were native Japanese. They were fastened 
to crosses planted on the Hill of Martyrs in Nagasaki and speared to death. 
Pope Pius IX canonized St. Philip of Jesus and the 23 other men in 1862, and 
their feast is celebrated on February 5.

▶ Standing up to the Communist regime in Russia
C
atholicism isn’t the only Christian religion to officially designate certain 
men and women as saints. Eastern Orthodox have as strong a devo-
tion to these heavenly friends of God as their Roman Catholic counterparts. 
Alaska was Russian territory before it was sold to the U.S. As such, missionar-
ies were sent to this wilderness to spread the Orthodox faith.
Alaska became the 49th state in 1959 (first purchased for America by 
Secretary of State William Seward in 1867 for $7 million). The Orthodox 
Church in America (OCA) made great progress in this new frontier, and we 
highlight several of their saints in this chapter.
Understanding orthodoxy
The early church was initially set up as one 
Christian Church shepherded by Patriarchs 
from the five cities in which the Twelve 
Apostles had established a Christian commu-
nity: Rome, Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, 
and Constantinople. In 1054, the Patriarch of 
Constantinople declared his independence 
from the Pope and created a separate church, 
the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Orthodox 
Church in America (OCA) is part of that church.
In 1589, while maintaining informal ties with 
Constantinople, Moscow became the sixth 
Patriarchate and declared the Russian 
Orthodox Church autocephalous, or as having 
an independent leader. The Patriarch of 
Moscow declared the Orthodox Church in 
America autocephalous in 1970; the problem 
with this declaration for the OCA was that the 
Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople wasn’t 
consulted and didn’t concur. For that reason, 
the Greek Orthodox Church doesn’t recognize 
the OCA as independent but rather sees it as a 
daughter church of Moscow.
As for the Russian Orthodox Church, it sent 
many missionaries to evangelize the Aleuts 
and Eskimo Indians in Russian North America 
(Alaska before it was sold to the United States 
in 1867).

St. Alexander Hotovitzky
Russia (1872–1937)
Glorified: 1994
Feast day: December 4
Alexander Hotovitzky was a key figure in strengthening the Russian Orthodox 
Church in Russia at a time when the Bolshevik Revolution and communism 
fought to destroy the Christian communities in that country.
Alexander was ordained into the priesthood in 1896 at the diocesan cathe-
dral in San Francisco. Within a week, he returned to New York to become the 
pastor of St. Nicholas Church and was instrumental in the establishment of 
many new Orthodox parishes, including those in Yonkers, New York; Passaic, 
New Jersey; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He also edited the journal 
American Orthodox Messenger.
Father Alexander also served as a priest in Helsinki, Finland, from 1914 
to 1917 — no easy task, as Finland was a primarily Protestant (Lutheran) 
Christian population. He was transferred to Moscow in 1917 and assigned the 
position of assistant pastor of Christ the Savior Cathedral.
That same year, the Bolshevik Revolution, which deposed Tsar Nicholas II 
and the Romanov Dynasty under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, sought to 
dismantle the Russian Orthodox Church. The Communist Party was openly 
and publicly atheistic, and any ties between the Kremlin and the Patriarch of 
Moscow quickly unraveled. Religious persecution began in earnest.
(continued)
Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the 
Patriarchate of Moscow lost much of its power 
and influence. The Orthodox Church in America 
(OCA) gained such strong independence that 
by 1970 Moscow and some other Eastern 
Churches recognized the OCA’s autonomy 
despite the rebuff from Constantinople. And 
despite the disagreements regarding Church 
status, the different branches of Orthodoxy 
share cordial relations.
Unlike the Roman Catholic Church, in which 
canonization is a papal prerogative invok-
ing papal infallibility, the Eastern Orthodox 
Churches refer to the designation of sainthood 
as glorification, and it’s done by a Patriarch 
and/or a synod (a council of bishops). As such, 
the designation of sainthood doesn’t have the 
same strict requirements of a certain number 
of miracles as are in the case for possible can-
didates in the Western (Latin) Church in Rome.

165
 Chapter 12: American Orthodox Saints
Father Alexander was arrested three times between 1920 and 1937 on charges 
of treason and subverting the State. His only “crime” was that he refused to 
join the Communist Party and instead openly preached on the autonomy of 
the Russian Orthodox Church.
No known records detail the exact date or place of his execution, but the 
Orthodox Church nevertheless reveres Father Alexander Hotovitzky as a New 
Martyr, the term used for anyone executed by the Soviet Union because of 
allegiance to the Russian Orthodoxy.
St. Herman of Alaska
Russia (1756–1837)
Glorified: 1970
Feast day: August 9
St. Herman was the first missionary to the Alaskan territory (then called 
Russian North America), where he sought to preach the Orthodox faith to the 
Aleut and Eskimo Indians. He arrived in Kodiak with seven monks in 1794 to 
begin their missionary work.
Herman’s mission wasn’t just spiritual; besides preaching the faith, he built 
schools for the native children and worked to defend them from being 
exploited by Russian fur traders. Sometime between 1808 and 1818, Herman 
went to Spruce Island, which he called New Valaam; it’s where he spent the 
rest of his life running a school, taking care of orphans, and praying.
According to pious tradition, Herman placed an icon of Theotokos (Mary, the 
Mother of God) on the beach before an impending tidal wave and the water 
never rose above the image, thus sparing the villagers.
St. Innocent of Alaska
Russia (1797–1879)
Glorified: 1977
Feast day: March 31
John (Ivan) Evseyevich Popov-Veniaminov traveled extensively through the 
Alaskan territory and preached wherever he went, eventually being regarded 
as the “Apostle of Alaska.” John spoke six native dialects and preached

from Sitka to Kamchatka until he was called home to Mother Russia. He was 
appointed the Metropolitan of Moscow (a post that ranks between the arch-
bishop and the Patriarch) in 1867, replacing his friend and mentor, Filaret. It 
was at this time he took vows as a monk and assumed the name Innocent.
St. Jacob Netsvetov
Alaska (1802–1862)
Glorified: 1994
Feast day: July 26
After leaving his Alaskan home to pursue an education in Russia, Jacob was 
ordained a priest and sought to return home to minister to his own people. 
He was returned to Atka Island, Alaska, where he had been raised, and imme-
diately took to work.
Within the first six months on the job, Father Jacob baptized 16 people, con-
firmed 442 people, married 53 couples, and presided over 8 funerals. He later 
ventured as far as the Yukon Territory of Canada, evangelizing the Orthodox 
faith. When he had gotten older, an ambitious assistant attempted to slander 
the good name of Father Jacob in the hopes of being promoted in his place. 
When Jacob appeared before the Archbishop, his innocence was easily estab-
lished; however, the stressful situation took a toll on his health and he died 
at the age of 60 among his Eskimo parishioners.
St. John Kochurov
Russia (1871–1917)
Glorified: 1994
Feast day: October 31
Something of a zealot, John volunteered to leave his home in the Ryazan 
region of Russia to work as a missionary in Alaska (which by then was part of 
the United States). He arrived in New York City and found himself struggling 
against language and cultural barriers. Eventually John was sent to Chicago 
to care for Saint Vladimir’s Cathedral; he secured donations from Tsar 
Nicholas II and from wealthy Americans and was able to renovate and restore 
the Cathedral to its proper glory.
Father John was elevated to Archpriest and returned to Russia in 1907 after 
a successful apostolate in the U.S. Unfortunately, the Russian Revolution 
in 1917 didn’t bode well for him and other members of the clergy as the 

167
 Chapter 12: American Orthodox Saints
Communists sought to eradicate the Church once and for all. Father John 
worked arduously in St. Petersburg, preaching to hundreds if not thousands 
of believers in less than ten years. He was executed by the Bolsheviks during 
the bloody purge of the Red Russians over the White Russians and is consid-
ered a martyr for the Orthodox religion.
St. John Maximovitch, Bishop of 
Shanghai and San Francisco
Russia (1896–1966)
Glorified: 1994
Feast day: July 2
John was ordained a priest in 1926, shortly after he and his family emigrated 
from Russia to Yugoslavia to escape the Communist purge of religion. Over 
the next 36 years, his career led him to bishop installments with the Russian 
Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) in Shanghai and Western 
Europe and eventually to the post of Archbishop of San Francisco, which he 
held from 1951 to 1962.
While bishop in China, Bishop John ministered to the small but growing com-
munity of believers until the Red Revolution of Mao Tse-tung persecuted 
Christians just as the Bolsheviks had done in Russia half a century earlier. 
Bishop John and 5,000 believers escaped to the Philippines. From there, 
Bishop John went to the U.S., where he remained for the rest of his life.
St. Juvenaly of Alaska
Russia (1761–1796)
Glorified: 1977
Feast day: September 24
In 1793, Juvenaly led a missionary journey from his home in Russia to Alaska, 
where he and his companions were able to convert 12,000 Alaskan natives 
to the Russian Orthodox faith by showing the natives’ shaman that natural 
religion was fulfilled and perfected in the supernatural and divinely revealed 
Christian religion. Where others alienated the natives by denigrating their 
former beliefs, Juvenaly built upon them.

168
Part III: Living the Faith 
Juvenaly was martyred by natives in 1796, but the reason remains a mys-
tery. One theory is that a group of local Indians resented the requirement 
of Orthodoxy to end polygamy. Another is that a whole tribe had second 
thoughts after being baptized into the faith and thought the only way to 
“undo” the obligation was by killing the one who baptized them. Regardless 
of the motive, the priest was killed in the line of duty and warranted a mar-
tyr’s legacy.
St. Nikolai Velimirovic
Serbia (1880–1956)
Glorified: 2003
Feast day: March 5
During World War I, the Serbian Church sent Nikolai to England and America, 
where he held numerous lectures in support of fighting for the union of the 
Serbs and South Slavic peoples. He returned to Serbia in 1919, and in 1920, he 
was posted to the Ohrid archbishopric in Macedonia.
Bishop Nikolai was arrested by the Nazis in 1941 in the Žiˇca Monastery and 
was confined in the Ljubostinja Monastery. On December 14, 1944, he was 
sent to Dachau, a concentration camp, with Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo, where 
the bishop suffered brutal torture and abuse.
At the end of World War II, Bishop Nikolai fled Communist Yugoslavia and 
emigrated to the U.S. Some of the Orthodox Christian seminaries in which 
he taught include St. Sava’s Serbian Orthodox Seminary in Libertyville, 
Illinois; St. Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary, now in Crestwood, 
New York; and St. Tikhon’s Orthodox Theological Seminary and Monastery 
in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. He died on March 18, 1956, while rector of St. 
Tikhon’s.
St. Raphael of Brooklyn
Lebanon (1860–1915)
Glorified: 2000
Feast day: February 27
Rafla Hawaweeny was born of Syrian parents in Lebanon, but because of 
the anti-Christian efforts of radical Muslims, he was forced to flee to Russia 
to become ordained. He was sent to the United States to be Rector of St. 

169
 Chapter 12: American Orthodox Saints
Nicholas Church in Brooklyn, and became the first Orthodox bishop to be 
consecrated on American soil when Bishop Tikhon and Bishop Innocent 
ordained him in 1904 at St. Nicholas Cathedral in Brooklyn. The new bishop’s 
vestments were a gift from Tsar Nicholas II.
Bishop Raphael consecrated the grounds for St Tikhon’s Monastery in South 
Canaan, Pennsylvania, in 1905 and blessed the orphanage there as well. He 
also founded the Antiochian Archdiocese.
Although fluent in Arabic, Bishop Raphael saw the benefit of allowing English 
into the Divine Liturgy because many young people were children of immi-
grants and therefore no longer knew the language of their ancestors.
St. Tikhon of Moscow
Russia (1865–1925)
Glorified: 1989
Feast day: September 26
Vasily Ivanovich Belavin was ordained a priest in 1891 and took the 
name Tikhon. He was transferred from the Pskov Seminary to the Kholm 
Theological Seminary in 1892 and made archimandrite (head of a large mon-
astery, equivalent to an archabbot in the Roman church). Archimandrite 
Tikhon was consecrated Bishop of Lublin in 1897 and returned to Kholm for a 
year as Vicar Bishop of the Kholm Diocese.
He worked in the U.S. for several years, blessing the cornerstone for St. 
Nicholas Cathedral in New York in 1901 and, in 1902, consecrating the 
church of St. Nicholas in Brooklyn for the Syrian Orthodox immigrants. Two 
weeks later, he consecrated St Nicholas Cathedral in New York. In 1905, the 
American Mission was made an Archdiocese, and Bishop Tikhon was ele-
vated to the rank of Archbishop.
Archbishop Tikhon returned to Russia in 1907 and was elected Patriarch of 
Moscow in 1917. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he condemned the execu-
tion of the Tsar and the Imperial Family. He was imprisoned in Donskoy 
Monastery for a year after openly opposing the government’s confiscation of 
Church property.
Both the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia and the Orthodox Church in 
America owe a lot to this beloved Patriarch, who worked arduously to sup-
port his Church and who defended it to his dying day.

Part IV
Explaining 
the Faith

In this part . . .
I
n Part IV we highlight the great teachers and defenders 
of the faith — those educated scholars of theology who 
explained the doctrines of Catholic Christianity or who 
preached edifying and erudite sermons on religious 
truths. These saints aren’t all men; some women saints 
have been named Doctors of the Church for their pro-
found insights and influence on understanding spiritual 
matters. 
We go from west to east, looking at the Latin Fathers of 
the Western Church and the Greek Fathers of the Eastern 
Church (before the schism of 1054), which are like two 
lungs of the one Church, before division disrupted that 
unity.

Chapter 13
Doctors of the Church
In This Chapter
▶ Scholarly saints like Augustine, Jerome, and Thomas Aquinas
▶ Other influential Doctors of the Church
T
he lives and teachings of some holy men and women were so profound 
and had such an impact that their titles have gone beyond the Father or 
Sister of the Catholic Church. These leaders are Doctors of the Church, a title 
that recognizes their works and writings as well as their lives. Final approval 
from the pope is required before the title may be bestowed upon a worthy 
recipient.
In this chapter, we introduce those doctors whose works and writings have 
significantly changed the world.
St. Albert the Great
Lauingen, Bavaria (1206–1280)
Beatified: 1622
Canonized: 1931
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1931
Patron: scientists, chemists
Feast day: November 15
As a member of the Order of Preachers, also called Dominicans, Albert’s early 
career included teaching assignments in Cologne, Regensburg, Strasburg, 
and Paris, where he earned his master’s degree. His writings include a veri-
table library of books on philosophy, theology, and biblical studies. Thirty-
eight volumes of his work are still in existence, some of which contain many 
of his sermons. Albert was an authority in the natural sciences — physics, 
geography, astronomy, mineralogy, alchemy, and biology — as well as in the 
branches of philosophy (logic, metaphysics, mathematics, and ethics).

174
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
 
Albert contributed greatly in the area of philosophy by translating works from 
Aristotle and incorporating them into Christian studies. Philosophy, a disci-
pline relying on human reasoning and logic, is an indispensable tool for under-
standing theology, the study of divinely revealed truths.
St. Albert’s greatest student, Thomas Aquinas, also became a saint and a 
Doctor of the Church (see his entry later in this chapter).
St. Alphonsus Liguori
Marianella, Campania, Kingdom of Naples (1696–1787)
Beatified: 1816
Canonized: 1839
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1871
Patron: scholars
Feast day: August 1
Alphonsus left a career in law to pursue a vocation in the priesthood, even-
tually founding the Congregation of the Holy Redeemer, also known as 
Redemptorists. Two of his books, The Holy Eucharist and Glories of Mary, were 
responses to attacks on the frequency of Holy Communion and devotion to 
Mary.
St. Ambrose
Trier, Germany (AD 337–AD 397)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1298
Patron: religion teachers and students
Feast day: December 7
Ambrose was a staunch defender of the faith and the divinity of Christ, bat-
tling Arianism until eventually eliminating the heresy altogether. A collection 
of Ambrose’s sermons formed a basis for a treatise of his theological works.
Ambrose had two significant struggles to face during his career — a clash 
with the Roman Emperor Theodosius and the conversion of Augustine.
Theodosius, taking revenge on those who questioned his authority, ordered 
the slaughter of 7,000 people just to prove a point. Ambrose commanded the 
emperor to do a public penance, which he did.

175
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Ambrose delivered a sermon heard by Augustine, who was avoiding Baptism, 
and Augustine’s mother, St. Monica. Augustine was so moved by Ambrose’s 
sermon that he asked to be baptized immediately and went on to become one 
of the greatest theologians and saints of the church.
In his many writings, Ambrose dealt with issues of liturgical reformation and 
diocesan structure, homilies, and ascetical and poetical theology. He died on 
Good Friday in AD 397, but his feast is celebrated on December 7, the day he 
was made Bishop of Milan.
St. Anselm
Aosta, Kingdom of Burgundy (1033–1109)
Canonized: 1494
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1720
Feast day: April 21
Anselm is considered the father of scholasticism, the medieval theological 
and philosophical method of learning that follows the teachings of Aristotle, 
St. Augustine, and other leaders of the early Christian Church. Scholasticism 
bridges the gap between religion and reason.
Anselm’s writings contributed greatly to defining God’s attributes as well as 
further explaining the notions of truth, free will, the origins of evil, and the art 
of reasoning. Two of his most notable works are Monologium, which provides 
metaphysical proofs of the existence of God, and Proslogium, a study of God’s 
attributes.
He became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1092. Though the Cathedral now 
belongs to the Anglican Church and suffered the ravages of the Protestant 
Revolt of Henry VIII, it is believed that his relics remain in a chapel dedicated 
to him in this edifice.
St. Anthony of Padua
Lisbon, Portugal (1195–1231)
Canonized: 1232
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1946
Patron: finding lost items
Feast day: June 13

176
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Anthony’s remarkable speaking abilities — in the pulpit and out — earned 
him the title of “the Ark of the Testament” from Pope Gregory IX. His public 
speaking skills led to an assignment at the University of Padua, but his real 
talent came from the pulpit, where he won over many souls through the art 
of persuasion.
Anthony became a member of the Order of Friars Minor (OFM), more com-
monly known as the Franciscans, in 1220. He was responsible for real reform 
within the Church, as well as many conversions to the Church.
Anthony is the patron saint you go to whenever something (or someone) is 
lost. Anthony’s prayer book was missing one day, and he prayed to God that 
he find it. Turns out that a novice stole the book and ran off, intending to 
leave religious life and sell the book for money. As soon as Anthony prayed, 
however, the novice had a change of heart, repented of his sin, and returned 
the book and himself to the friary. Since then, Catholics have invoked St. 
Anthony to find lost car keys, eyeglasses, and all kinds of items, not to men-
tion a missing person or two.
St. Athanasius
Alexandria, Egypt (AD 296–AD 373)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1568
Feast day: May 2
Athanasius was a strong supporter of Christian orthodoxy and battled the 
philosophy and beliefs of Arian heretics. His work, Incarnation, speaks out in 
defense of Christ’s divinity and humanity. He often found himself a target of 
attack from heretics, who were in the majority at the time, and was sent into 
exile many times.
Saint of the “Golden Tongue”
Though his impact in the classroom and in the 
pulpit may have led to St. Anthony’s nickname 
as the saint with the “Golden Tongue,” the 
title became more significant after his death, 
when it was discovered that his actual tongue 
has remained incorrupt. So eloquently did he 
preach that on one occasion, when a town of 
heretics obstinately refused to listen to him, 
Anthony preached to the fish in the nearby 
lake. The fish in great multitude lined up in rows 
and columns and popped their heads out of the 
water, as if to listen to the great orator. When 
the townsfolk saw the miraculous event, they 
decided to listen for themselves and were soon 
converted back to the faith.

177
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Because of his works of theology (especially against Arius), his fundamental 
preaching and teaching, and his physical suffering because of his orthodoxy, 
he was made Doctor of the Church at the time of his canonization. His relics 
are in the city of Venice.
St. Augustine
Thagaste, Numidia (AD 354–AD 430)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1298
Patron: philosophers, printers
Feast day: August 28
Augustine was a champion of the Catholic faith through his writings and ser-
mons and worked to eradicate the Manichaeism cult, a religious sect to which 
he once belonged. Followers of this religious sect believed in the separation of 
matter and spirit and of good and evil, leading them to indulge in immoralities.
After his conversion to the Catholic faith, Augustine wrote many spiritual and 
theological works, including The Confessions of St. Augustine, Three Dialogues 
Against the Academicians, Of the Happy Life, and Of the Order. He became the 
Bishop of Hippo and confronted the early stages of a new Christian heretical 
militant sect, the Donatists. In an act of diplomacy, Augustine met with the 
sect leaders, a meeting that eventually led to their decline.
Then came Pelagianism, yet another sect that denied the doctrine of original 
sin and taught that Baptism was merely a “golden ticket” to heaven and that 
grace wasn’t necessary for salvation. Augustine staunchly opposed this sect 
through his sermons and writings.
Augustine founded a community of religious life for men and women and cre-
ated a system of regulations, the Rule, to govern this community — a system 
that’s still in use in the Order of St. Augustine.
St. Basil
Caesarea, Cappadocia (AD 329–AD 379)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1568
Patron: Cappadocia (a region in Turkey), hospital administrators
Feast day: January 2

178
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Basil comes from a saintly lineage: his parents, St. Basil the Elder and St. 
Emmelia; some of his siblings, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Macrina the Younger, 
and St. Peter of Sebaste; and his grandmother, St. Macrina.
Basil was an eloquent orator and writer and defended the true faith in the 
face of opposition and slander from the Arian heretics. He died in AD 379 and 
is venerated in both the Eastern and Western Churches as a Doctor of the 
Church.
St. Bede, the Venerable
Sunderland, England (AD 672–AD 735)
Canonized: 1899
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1879
Patron: scholars
Feast day: May 25
Bede knew at an early age that he wanted to follow the Benedictine way of 
life, entering a monastery for studies and eventually joining that same mon-
astery as a monk. These monks led a life of ora et labora — Latin for “prayer 
and work” — where their entire day was divided between praying in the 
chapel and doing work in the monastery. The Benedictines are a highly intel-
lectual society, as well; many monasteries had extensive libraries where theo-
logical, liturgical, and biblical scholarship were second to none.
During his life in the monastery, Bede wrote the history of England up to the 
eighth century and translated Scripture from Latin into Old English. One of 
his last works was the translation of the Gospel of John.
Venerable Bede would chant with the rest of the monks starting in the early 
morning and periodically throughout the day, in keeping with monastic 
tradition. Though unusual for a monk to be given lofty titles, Bede was 
called Venerable by his pupils because of his great knowledge and studious 
personality.
St. Bernard of Clairvaux
Fontaine-lès-Dijon, France (1090–1153)
Canonized: 1174

179
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1830
Patron: beekeepers, candle makers
Feast day: August 20
Bernard, founder of the Cistercian monastery, was a valiant defender of the 
pope and was often called upon to preach crusades when the pope felt the 
Holy Land and its shrines were threatened. He did this with great zeal, believ-
ing that the sacred components of Christ’s life should remain in Christian 
hands. During the second crusade, Bernard noticed that devotion and reli-
gious attitude among his soldiers was lacking, and they were slipping into 
sinful behavior, leading to the failure of the crusade.
He was a great influence on religious architecture. Most of the churches at 
the time were built in a Gothic style — very ornate and heavy with decora-
tion. In contrast, Bernard’s chapel and style resonated with light and simplic-
ity, a style that became common throughout the Cistercian monastic chapel.
A vast array of his writings and sermons show a great devotion to the 
Blessed Virgin Mary; Bernard is credited for the composition of the famous 
prayer, “Memorare of Mary.” He is also responsible for a series of sermons 
that preached against the heresy of Albigensianism. Thanks to his preaching, 
many people were converted, healed, and brought into line of orthodoxy.
St. Bonaventure
Bagnoregio, Province of Viterbo, Papal States (1221–1274)
Canonized: 1482
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1588
Patron: theology professors, those suffering intestinal problems
Feast day: July 15
One of the biggest commissions of Bonaventure’s life was his work seeking 
unification between the Eastern or Orthodox Church and the Western or 
Latin Church. The emperor of Constantinople asked the pope to look into 
the viability of unity, and Bonaventure was chosen to take on this task fol-
lowing the death of Thomas Aquinas. Although some progress was made, 
Bonaventure died before unification could take place.
Prior to this commission, Bonaventure was an excellent student at the 
University of Paris, proficient in philosophy and theology, especially the new 
scholastic mode. In his religious life, he was charitable, humble, and a hard 

180
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
worker. Bonaventure is considered the second founder of the Franciscan 
Order, following a conflict between two opposing sides: those who sought 
stricter enforcement of the rule and those who became lax. When he was 
elected superior general, Bonaventure sought out virtue, generally found in 
the middle of the two sides of opposition. He worked for the authentic trans-
lation of the rule of St. Francis for the order and wrote many books on mysti-
cal theology, adapting the philosophy of Plato in a Christian light.
St. Catherine of Siena
Siena, Italy (1347–1380)
Canonized: 1461
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1970
Patron: Italy, Europe, against miscarriages
Feast day: April 29
Catherine (shown in Figure 13-1) fought for her faith early in life — first 
against her parents, and then against skeptics who doubted the heavenly 
visions she received. Some thought she was a saint, others a religious fanatic, 
and still others a hypocrite. She was interviewed and questioned by theolo-
gians and religious leaders, all of whom found her to be authentic.

St. Catherine.
 
 
Alinari/Art Resource, NY

181
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Catherine devoted her life to nursing, caring for the most seriously ill: those 
with cancer and leprosy. She was often able to convert sinners who would 
initially taunt her and gossip about her; later, she visited death-row prisoners 
to work for their conversion so that they could receive the Last Sacrament.
She is most famously recognized as the Patroness of Italy, a title bestowed 
upon her because of her industrious work in returning the pope to Italy. 
For more than 70 years, the popes had been in voluntary exile in Avignon, 
France, because of the wretched conditions in Rome and most of central 
Italy at the time. It had become so dangerous that, in 1305, Pope Clement V, 
a Frenchman, moved the Papal Curia to Avignon, to property that popes had 
owned for centuries.
Seven popes made Avignon home from 1305 to 1377, when Catherine traveled 
to the papal estates and pleaded with the Roman pontiff to return to Rome. 
Catherine’s reputation as a respected mystic proved valuable, as her request 
was granted and the papal court was brought back to Rome.
St. Cyril of Alexandria
Theodosius, Egypt (AD 378–AD 444)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1882
Patron: Alexandria, Egypt
Feast day: June 27
Cyril worked hard defending the faith against the many heresies concern-
ing Christ. One such heresy was expounded by Nestorius, patriarch of 
Constantinople, which taught that Christ is two persons — one God and 
the other human — instead of the orthodox teaching that Christ is one 
divine person with two natures: human and divine. Cyril pleaded to Pope 
St. Celestine I to look into Nestorianism; the pope found the teachings of 
Nestorius to be heretical and subsequently condemned them.
The condemnation led to the convening of the Ecumenical Council of 
Ephesus in AD 431, in which St. Cyril was the leading prelate. The council 
solemnly defined the hypostatic union — one divine person with two natures; 
human and divine. The council also affirmed the title “Mary, Mother of God.” 
Nestorius had maintained that only the title “Mother of Christ” could be 
used because Mary wasn’t a goddess and therefore couldn’t be the mother 
of divinity. Cyril and the council, however, defended the use of the term 
“Mother of God.” While remaining a human being, Mary nevertheless con-
ceived and gave birth to the Son of God. Her Son, Jesus, is divine. Hence, by 

182
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
her relationship to Jesus, she can be called the “Mother of God,” as her son is 
truly the Son of God.
Cyril was also a great advocate of Holy Communion. He staunchly believed 
that the bread and wine consecrated by the priest at Mass become the real, 
true, and substantial body and blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. He urged 
fellow believers to receive Holy Eucharist properly and frequently.
St. Cyril of Jerusalem
Caesarea Maritima, Palestine (AD 315–AD 386)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1882
Patron: Jerusalem
Feast day: March 18
Cyril of Jerusalem was an ordained priest and great philosophical instructor 
who so believed in the sacraments and that Jesus was the true Son of God 
that many of his writings set out guidelines for observing and partaking in the 
Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.
His instructions serve as the basis for the “Catechesis,” one of his instruc-
tional writings. He found himself at odds with Arius, the founder of the 
Arianism heresy, who denied that Jesus was of the same substance as God.
The First Council of Nicea solemnly defined that the Son is indeed equal to 
the Father and that Christ was consubstantial (of the same substance, not just 
similar) to God the Father. The ruling was ratified again at the First Council of 
Constantinople in AD 381.
St. Ephraem of Syria
Nisibis, Mesopotamia (AD 306–AD 373)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1920
Patron: spiritual directors
Feast day: June 9
Music played a vital role in Ephraem’s life, as well as in his ministry. He 
helped to combat the Gnostic heresy by presenting orthodox theology 
through hymns and music. He started using a women’s choir in liturgical wor-
ship and is considered a great contributor to music in the Syriac liturgy. It is 
in this liturgy that Ephraem was bestowed the title, “Harp of the Holy Ghost.”

183
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
The most famous collection of his writings is Hymns against Heresies. Among 
the heresies he combated with these works was docetism, which taught that 
Jesus’s physical body was merely an illusion.
St. Francis de Sales
Château de Thorens, Savoy (1567–1622)
Canonized: 1655
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1877
Patron: Catholic press, deaf people
Feast day: January 24
Francis was a champion of the Counter-Reformation period, using his devout 
faith to preach, teach, and give witness to God and winning over many con-
verts. He was a learned man, well educated in law, philosophy, theology, and 
rhetoric. He founded the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, which was a leading 
force during the Counter-Reformation.
With St. Jane Frances de Chantal, he cofounded the Visitation Order of Nuns, 
and one of his most well-known books, still in use today, is The Introduction 
to the Devout Life, which was translated into many different languages. He 
developed a pocket catechism based on the reforms and clear teachings of 
the Council of Trent; this catechism was used in his diocese when he became 
Bishop of Geneva. It became known as the “Bishop’s Catechism” and was a 
bulwark in converting the area to Catholicism, especially the youth. He also 
created a form of sign language to help lead his instructions to the deaf.
St. Gregory Nazianzen
Arianzum, Cappadocia (AD 329–AD 390)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1568
Feast day: January 2
Gregory was something of a reluctant saint, fleeing his family after an ordina-
tion that was largely orchestrated by his father. His friend St. Basil convinced 
him to return to help his father, who was at that time bishop of their home-
town diocese. St. Basil later sought to consecrate Gregory a bishop and sent 
him to a trouble area. Because of politics, Gregory could never take over the 
diocese, but he worked alongside his father as co-adjutor.

184
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Upon the death of the Archbishop of Constantinople, Gregory was summoned 
to go to this see and bring the people in line with the orthodox faith. The 
area had suffered isolation for nearly 30 years because of the Arian heresy. 
Under duress but under obedience, he accepted the task to become its new 
archbishop.
Gregory was at first met with opposition; the Eastern Empire was expecting 
a more striking and majestic figure. Despite his initial reception, Gregory’s 
sermons on the Trinity combating Arianism are most celebrated. He was 
attacked by the Arianists, and only after the conversion of the emperor was 
Gregory installed as archbishop. New enemies soon arose, however — this 
time with political adversaries seeking to overtake the archdiocese. Gregory 
asked the emperor if he could return to his native land to preserve peace, 
and the emperor agreed.
Pope St. Gregory the Great
Rome, Italy (AD 540–AD 604)
Canonized: AD 604
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1298
Patron: educators, musicians, singers, popes, and those suffering from 
the gout
Feast day: September 3
Pope Gregory was a great reformer and skilled writer, dedicating his life as a 
“servant of the servants of God” in his papal role. Gregory was a magnificent 
evangelist, sending missionaries to the Barbarians in the north and to the 
pagan Anglo-Saxons of England at a time when Rome was in ruins because of 
the Barbarian invasions. (See Chapter 8 for more on Gregory’s ascent to and 
actions in the papacy.)
It was his writings, however, that led to his consideration as a Doctor of the 
Church. During his career, Gregory wrote 40 sermons on the Gospels, as well 
as The Life of St. Benedict, Commentary on the Book of Job, The Rule of Pastors, 
and more than 800 letters.
St. Hilary of Poitiers
Pictavium, Gaul (France) (AD 315–AD 367)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1851

185
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Patron: exiles; against snakebites
Feast day: January 13
Born of two pagan parents, Hilary used his own powers of reason and con-
cluded that there must be a God. He was introduced to the Scriptures, which 
led him to convert to Christianity. He was married at the time of his episcopal 
consecration and, out of humility, didn’t want to take a religious office — but 
he was unanimously nominated.
Hilary was a leader in the fight against Arianism and wrote “De fide 
Orientalium,” a theological work addressed specifically to the followers of 
Arius. Other works include “De Trinitate Libri XII,” a theological composi-
tion on the Blessed Trinity, and “Ad Constantium Agustum Liber Secundus,” 
a letter presented to the emperor to defend himself against the lies of his 
enemies and argue for the vindication of his trinitarian treatise.
St. Isidore of Seville
Cartagena, Spain (AD 560–AD 636)
Canonized: 1598
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1722
Patron: computers, the Internet
Feast day: April 4
Isidore is considered one of the last great early Church Fathers in the West 
whose textbook, Etymologiae, or Origines, was a major influence on the sys-
temic study of classical works in the universities throughout the Middle Ages. 
All the classic studies — logic, theology, geography, and architecture — were 
covered within the pages of his textbook.
Other writings include commentaries on the Scriptures, a compendium of 
moral and dogmatic theology, and a book on monastic life.
St. Jerome
Stridon, Dalmatia (AD 347–AD 419)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1298
Patron: archeologists, Bible scholars, translators, archivists, librarians
Feast day: September 30

186
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Using his knowledge of both Hebrew and Greek — two languages that figure 
heavily in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible — Jerome trans-
lated the Bible into the Latin Vulgate, considered more authentic than prior 
translations because Jerome corrected prior, erroneous translations.
He also wrote vast commentaries on the Scriptures. His writings include biog-
raphies of various saints and letters, as well as a theological treatise against 
Arianism. His works also include many letters, including those in defense 
of the doctrine of the Perpetual Virginity of Mary. He is second only to St. 
Augustine as the most prolific writer of the early Church Fathers. He retired 
as a monk in Bethlehem and died there in AD 420.
St. John Chrysostom
Antioch (AD 347–AD 407)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1568
Patron: preachers, orators, public speaking, and those suffering from 
epilepsy
Feast day: September 13
St. John Chrysostom was a great orator, interpreter of sacred Scripture, and 
theologian who faced many assignations from other prelates who sought his 
position as Archbishop of Constantinople. He was one of the greatest hom-
ilists in the early Church and wrote many sermons on both the New and Old 
Testaments; his sermons on paganism convinced people to tear down the 
pagan temples. His prayers and liturgical guidelines are still in use today in 
the Byzantine Catholic Church.
He died in exile in AD 407 and his body was carried back with great pomp and 
entombed in the Church of the Apostles in Constantinople.
St. John Damascene
Damascus, Syria (AD 645–AD 749)
Canonized: 1890
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1890
Patron: Christian artists, sick children
Feast day: December 4

187
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
Also known as St. John of Damascus, John followed in his father’s footsteps 
working for the Muslim government until the iconoclastic heresy rocked 
the Church in the East; at that time, John turned his energy and focus to the 
defense of orthodoxy. He wrote many treatises on the orthodoxy of icons, 
such as spiritual paintings of the Lord, Mary, and the saints.
The emperor of Constantinople misread the Scripture concerning icons and 
sought to ban them, but John refused to be swayed. The emperor was infuri-
ated and forged a letter to the caliph making false accusations, an act that led 
to severe punishment for John — his writing hand was severed. But through 
intercession from the Blessed Virgin Mary, his hand was restored.
The caliph saw his innocence and desired to reinstate his government 
position. However, John had another desire: to enter the monastery near 
Jerusalem, where he was ordained a priest and composed a plethora of 
writings.
Among his famous writings is the Fountain of Knowledge, which is divided 
into three sections: “Philosophical Chapters,” “Concerning Heresies,” and 
“Exact Expositions of the Orthodox Faith.” In response to the Monophosyite 
heresy, he composed the “Trisagion” hymn, which is still used in Byzantine 
liturgy today.
St. John of the Cross
Fontiveros, Spain (1542–1591)
Canonized: 1726
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1926
Patron: mystics, theologians, poets, a contemplative life
Feast day: December 14
John of the Cross was a leading reformer, both alongside St. Teresa of 
Avila (see her entry later in this chapter) and on his own in the Counter-
Reformation. His fellow Carmelites didn’t appreciate his desire to reform the 
order and return to the basics, for they had become accustomed to the more 
comfortable and worldly life they now lived. John was subsequently rejected, 
ignored, abused, and imprisoned. Eventually, the pope allowed him to found 
a branch of Carmelite priests, just as Teresa of Avila did with some Carmelite 
nuns. Both groups are known as Discalced Carmelites (meaning the absence 
of shoes — that is, they only wear sandals).

188
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
His writings include spiritual classics such as The Dark Night of the Soul, a 
narrative concerning the journey of the soul from earth toward heaven; The 
Ascent of Mount Carmel; and Spiritual Canticle. He also wrote poetry, including 
O Living Flame of Love, Poems, and A Collection of Spiritual Maxims. His writ-
ings (as well as St. Teresa of Avila’s literary contributions) reflect the great 
mystical heritage that characterized the 16th-century Counter-Reformation 
Church in Spain.
St. Lawrence of Brindisi
Brindisi, Apulia (Italy) (1559–1619)
Canonized: 1881
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1959
Patron: Brindisi (an ancient Italian city)
Feast day: July 21
Both a humble Franciscan friar and a great diplomat, Lawrence was sent as a 
nuncio — ambassador of the Holy See — to Bavaria, and then to Prague and 
Vienna to establish Franciscan friaries. The friaries became centers in which 
priests taught the Catholic faith.
Lawrence was also a great orator and was asked by Holy Roman Emperor 
Rudolf II to build an army against Ottoman threats at the Hungarian border.
His writings consisted of sermons, commentaries on the Book of Genesis, and 
a treatise against Martin Luther.
Pope St. Leo the Great
Tuscany, Italy (AD 400–AD 461)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1754
Patron: sacred music, musicians, singers
Feast day: November 10
Leo was named a Doctor of the Church because of his writings, the most 
prominent of which is “Tome,” a letter providing a statement of faith of the 
Roman Catholic Church. (See Chapter 8 for more on Leo’s papacy.)

 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
St. Peter Canisius
Nijmegen, Netherlands (1521–1597)
Canonized: 1925
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1925
Patron: catechism writers
Feast day: December 21
Peter was a leading force in the Counter-Reformation in Germany and com-
posed the German Catechism, a book that taught the basic Catholic principles 
of faith. A member of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, he firmly established a 
Jesuit community in Germany, a community that grew and prospered into a 
strong conversion force.
Peter was assigned the position of papal theologian at the Council of Trent, 
the great reforming council. He opened several colleges, including those in 
Munich, Dillingen-Bavaria, and Innsbruck. He became confessor to the emper-
or’s daughter, Queen Magdalena, and was declared Venerable by Pope Pius X 
in 1906.
In a text called “De Maria Virgine,” he defended devotion to Mary and actively 
promoted the Rosary and lay associations of Mary. Other notable works by 
Peter are “Summa Doctrinae Christinae,” “Catechismus Minimus,” and “Parus 
Catechismus Catholicorum.”
St. Peter Chyrsologus
Imola, Bologna (Italy) (AD 406–AD 450)
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1729
Feast day: July 30
Upon the death of the Archbishop of Ravena, Peter accompanied the Bishop 
of Imola to Rome to deliver the people’s choice of a new archbishop, the 
custom of the time. However, the pope, having received a vision, rejected 
their choice and appointed Peter archbishop instead.
After he was consecrated, Peter discovered his diocese still had links to 
paganism, and he used his best skills — teaching and preaching — to deliver 
fiery sermons to help break the stronghold of the heresy.
He is known as the “Doctor of Homilies” because of his inspirational talks. 
Letters still exist today that prove his theological expertise. Peter taught Holy

Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Communion, as well as the tenets of the Apostles’ Creed, the lives of St. John 
the Baptist and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the incarnation of Christ. Today, 
more than 176 homilies and teachings are credited to Peter.
St. Peter Damian
Ravenna, Italy (1007–1072)
Canonized: 1828
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1828
Patron: diplomats
Feast day: February 21
Peter was a great example of clerical and monastic reform, eventually accept-
ing the position of abbot in a monastery and founding five other monasteries.
Peter stressed proper clergy lifestyle, attacking the moral depravity among 
the clergy in his treatise, Liber Gomorrhianus.
Peter Damian also was a champion in standing up for the authentic pope. He 
wrote First Crusade, a book on personal piety; Officium Beatae Virginis, a book 
on Mary; and De Divina Omnipotentia, a book on the power of God. He also 
wrote innumerable letters, sermons, and other writings.
St. Robert Bellarmine
Montepulciano, Italy (1542–1621)
Canonized: 1930
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1930
Patron: canon lawyers
Feast day: September 17
An ordained Jesuit priest, Robert taught himself both Greek and Hebrew, lan-
guages that would serve him well in translating the Sacred Scriptures.
He became the Archbishop of Capua in the Kingdom of Naples and rose to 
the rank of cardinal. He became a champion of enacting the reforms of the 
Council of Trent.
After the election of Pope St. Pius V, Robert returned to Rome and served the 
pope in various capacities. He was a special envoy to Venice when the pope 

191
 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
placed this republic under interdict because of disobedience. Robert dealt 
with King James I of England and countered the sovereign’s objections and 
false theological conclusions. He also dealt with Galileo Galilei and advised 
the astronomer that he should teach his scientific conclusions as hypotheses 
until proven as fact.
He’s most noted for composing four volumes on the Christian faith, 
Disputations on the Controversies, which were used in seminaries and 
schools of theology for more than 300 years.
St. Teresa of Avila (Or 
St. Teresa of Jesus)
Avila, Spain (1515–1582)
Canonized: 1622
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1970
Patron: lace makers, Spain, and those suffering from headaches
Feast day: October 15
Teresa, a Carmelite nun, became a great reformer and worked alongside 
St. John of the Cross (see his entry earlier in this chapter). Her first works of 
reform were within her own convent; at the time, the convent had become 
a social place for wealthy girls with large dowries who weren’t destined to 
marry. Teresa emphasized that religious life is a vocation of penance, prayer, 
poverty, and work. Her reformed monastery became known as the Discalced 
Carmelites.
She’s most remembered for her deeply spiritual mysticism, which she testi-
fies to in the book The Autobiography. Other books attributed to her include 
El Camino de Perfeccion, Mediation on the Song of Songs, El Castilo Interior, 
Relaciones, Conceptos del Amor, and Exclamaciones. Not only in writing but 
also in practice, Teresa experienced deep mental prayer. She is usually pic-
tured in ecstasy or enrapture and at times levitating, especially during Mass.
St. Thérèse of Lisieux
Alençon, France (1873–1897)
Canonized: 1925
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1997

192
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Patron: foreign missions; those suffering from tuberculosis
Feast day: October 1
Thérèse of Lisieux is better known as St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus. Despite 
her short life, she was quite a prolific writer, particularly remembered for her 
spiritual classic, Story of a Soul.
She dreamed of becoming a missionary and joining the Carmelites in Hanoi, 
Vietnam, but illness prevented her from ever leaving France. Thérèse was 
only 24 when she died from tuberculosis. 
Story of a Soul is divided into three sections: childhood, a letter to Sister 
Marie of the Sacred Heart, and details of her religious life. She wrote this 
under obedience from her superiors, and it was printed after she died. In 
her memoirs (and in practice), she lived by a phrase she coined, “Her little 
way,” a spiritual self-surrender to God. So many soldiers during World War 
I read her memoirs that she was later declared patroness of the foreign mis-
sions, even though she herself never left her monastery in France. The global 
impact of her life story, however, affected many around the world.
In Figure 13-2, St. Thérèse of Lisieux is shown kneeling and holding a dual pic-
ture of the child Jesus (left) and the image of the crucified face of Christ from 
St. Veronica’s veil (right).

 Chapter 13: Doctors of the Church
St. Thomas Aquinas
Roccasecca, Kingdom of Sicily (1225–1274)
Canonized: 1323
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1567
Patron: theologians, students, academics, booksellers, Catholic schools; 
against thunderstorms
Feast day: January 28
Thomas Aquinas’s vocation was sidelined for a time when he was kidnapped 
and imprisoned by his father, who didn’t want his son to join the Dominican 
Order (founded by St. Dominic de Guzman). He preferred that Thomas enter 
the Benedictine Order (founded by St. Benedict), which was well established 
and had possibilities of promotion to abbot (the equivalent of a bishop). 
Thomas, however, wanted to become a Dominican, a new religious commu-
nity (contemporaries of the Franciscans, founded by St. Francis of Assisi). 
This familial tumult did nothing to destroy his vocation, however, and he 
eventually took his vows as a Dominican and studied at the University of 
Paris. (See Chapter 9 for more on SS. Francis, Dominic, and Benedict.)
In his early days at the university, he was often misunderstood and called 
“dumb ox” by his classmates because they didn’t recognize his real intellec-
tual genius. Yet one of his teachers, St. Albert the Great (see the first entry in 
this chapter), believed that Thomas Aquinas would become one of the great-
est teachers of the Church. So profound are his writings that Thomas is often 
called the “angelic doctor,” implying the heavenly wisdom he possessed. 
Thomas studied the philosophy of Aristotle and reworked it to apply to 
Christianity. His expression that philosophy is “the handmaiden of theology” 
pointed to the importance of philosophy in explaining doctrinal issues. One 
of his greatest collections is Summa Theologica, in which he uses philosophy 
to explain the chief tenets of the Christian faith and pose arguments. Thomas 
had the ability to use logic and reason to understand, explain, and defend the 
Catholic faith. He often exhorted his students to “never deny, seldom affirm, 
always distinguish.” That was his way of disarming the rhetorical arguments 
and the irrational emotionalism often involved when people debate impor-
tant issues.
He’s also noted for composing prayers and music for the Mass of Corpus 
Christi, a feast that commemorates a eucharistic miracle in Orvieto, Italy.
His name is often invoked during thunderstorms. When Thomas was a child, 
his sister, who slept in the bed next to his, was struck and killed by lightning. 

194
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Thereafter, Thomas was terrified of thunderstorms, and every time a storm 
brewed, he went into church and prayed for God’s protection.
Thomas is often shown with a sun on his chest (a symbol of sacred learning), 
as in Figure 13-3. The book in the figure represents his extensive writings, 
especially the Summa Theologica, and the church he holds in his right hand 
represents the foundation of Catholic theology he helped establish by his 
precise philosophical method.

Saintly Pastors
In This Chapter
▶ St. Nicholas and St. Patrick
▶ Other notable shepherds of the Church
S
ome saints spent their lives serving the Church as pastors — priests or 
bishops who cared for people’s spiritual lives. Pastor means “shepherd,” 
and just as the good shepherd tends to the needs and safety of his flock, 
so too did these men. They were exemplary in their spiritual care of those 
entrusted to them. This chapter discusses just some of these important men.
St. Aloysius Gonzaga
Lombardy, Italy (1568–1591)
Beatified: 1605
Canonized: 1726
Patron: young students (because of his early catechetical work with 
them), Jesuit novices, and people with AIDS and their caregivers
Feast day: June 21
Aloysius was the eldest son of the Marquis of Castiglione, and, as such, he 
was born into certain expectations and demands. His father had hopes that 
he would enter the military and be a strong commander, but Aloysius wanted 
to live a religious life.
He and his brother were sent to various royal courts, most notably to Spain 
as part of the child prince’s retinue. That life grew tiresome for young 
Aloysius, and instead of taking part in the available pleasures, he continued 
to practice his devotions and disciplines. He fasted, rose early to pray and 
make a holy hour, and performed severe penances.

196
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
The death of the Spanish prince freed Aloysius from all royal duties, and 
he then worked toward entering a religious life. He had read journals and 
other material on saints and religious men and was interested in the Jesuits’ 
account of their missionary work in India. He wanted to join the Counter-
Reformation congregation.
Aloysius joined the Jesuit novitiate in Rome in 1585 as a frail young man 
afflicted with kidney disease and prone to chronic headaches. Schooling was 
in Milan, but Aloysius’s health prevented him from continuing. He returned to 
Rome as a plague epidemic hit the city. He volunteered in the Jesuit hospital 
and helped care for the sick.
Aloysius contracted the plague and died in 1591. He is enshrined in Rome at 
the Church of St. Ignatius.
St. Ansgar
France (AD 801–AD 865)
Feast day: February 3
Ansgar was a child of nobility raised in the Abbey of Corbie near Amiens, 
France. He grew up in piety and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and 
entered monastic life at the same abbey. He later transferred to Westphalia 
(a region in Germany), where he continued his preaching and teaching.
New opportunities for Catholicism and Christianity began to open in the 
northern European regions, and Ansgar stood at the forefront of those who 
sought to introduce Christianity to Denmark and Sweden. He was quite suc-
cessful in establishing churches in these areas.
Upon being summoned by Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious, he returned 
to France and was made Archbishop of Hamburg in AD 831. He continued 
to promote the Church through education and the building of churches and 
monasteries.
When Emperor Louis died in AD 840, the empire was divided among his three 
sons, and new churches came under attack, including the archdiocese in 
Hamburg. Eventually, the new emperor, Louis II, was able to bring peace, and 
Ansgar rebuilt his see.
Ansgar didn’t pastor to only the Church as a whole; he was also very much a 
pastor to the individual. Throughout his career as archbishop, he personally 
fed and tended to the sick and the poor, and his works of charity were known 
throughout the diocese. He dismissed any praise for his role of Christian 
service.

197
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
 
He is considered an apostle of northern Europe and patron saint of Denmark. 
He is also venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Lutheran 
and Anglican religions.
St. Anthony, the Abbot
Egypt (AD 251–AD 356)
Patron: basket makers, butchers, victims of eczema, and hermits (a type 
of monk); invoked against pestilence
Feast day: January 17
Although monasticism had been in existence for some time, Anthony is con-
sidered the father of Eastern monasticism for making it known and popular in 
a way no other monk was able to do. As a child, he led a life of extraordinary 
solitude and didn’t attend school outside the home. When his parents died, 
he inherited vast amounts of money and property and became his unmarried 
sister’s caretaker.
While attending church services, Anthony heard a gospel passage about a 
wealthy young man selling all he had and giving it to the poor. He took this 
message as a sign that God wanted him to do the same thing, so he placed his 
sister in the care of consecrated virgin women — which would later become 
the beginning of convent life — and sold all his property.
Anthony sequestered himself in solitude and entered a period of deep prayer, 
fasting, reading, and manual labor, thus beginning to perfect the virtues of 
humility, charity, and chastity.
In AD 305, Anthony founded the first of what would be several monasteries. 
He is believed to have died at the age of 105 after living a life of austerity and 
discipline.
The city of Vienna, in Austria, has a major shrine of St. Anthony, and a mon-
astery also exists in his honor.
St. Anthony Claret
Spain (1807–1870)
Beatified: 1934
Canonized: 1950

198
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Patron: textile merchants, weavers, Catholic press, Claretian missionar-
ies, and the diocese of the Canary Islands
Feast day: October 24
Anthony was born in Spain to a family involved in wool manufacturing. The 
family lived comfortably and stressed the importance of education. As a 
young adult, Anthony moved to Barcelona to continue the woolen trade but 
discovered he was more interested in religious life.
Anthony had hoped to enter the monastery of the strictest observance, the 
Carthusians, but his health wasn’t strong enough to allow him to follow that 
austere lifestyle. Instead, he was ordained a priest for his home diocese of 
Vic in Catalonia, Spain. He tried missionary work by joining the Jesuits in 
Rome, but again, his health began to deteriorate.
Returning to Spain, he preached missions in his native diocese and the 
Canary Islands. He established a religious community, the Congregation of 
Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, known as the Claretians.
Anthony’s holiness, organizational skills, and missionary zeal soon caught 
the eye of Queen Isabella II of Spain. At her request, Pope Pius IX appointed 
Anthony Archbishop of Santiago in Cuba. The diocese was a physical and 
spiritual mess, having suffered the effects of a revolution. Archbishop Claret 
reorganized the diocese, established schools, emphasized clerical discipline, 
and restructured the seminary.
Anthony was called back to Spain to be the queen’s confessor, and he worked 
at the military palace, Escorial, where he established a science laboratory in 
the monastery. In Barcelona, he established a library.
The political situation deteriorated in Italy and Spain, and Anthony went to 
Rome to prepare for the First Vatican Council, which would define papal infal-
libility. At the time, Italy was undergoing unification, the Papal States were 
threatened, and Anthony Claret proved to be a good support for Pope Pius IX.
St. Anthony Zaccaria
Italy (1502–1539)
Beatified: 1890
Canonized: 1897
Patron: the Barnabite community
Feast day: July 5

199
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
Anthony Zaccaria was educated in medicine and returned to his hometown 
to serve as a physician. It wasn’t long before he felt a deep attraction to 
religious life, and he was ordained into the priesthood in 1527. Anthony prac-
ticed works of charity among the poor and in hospitals.
He organized three religious institutions for priests, sisters, and laypeople. 
The Clerks Regular of St. Paul took vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience 
without being monastic or mendicants. The Angelic Sisters of St. Paul was 
founded to help young women avoid falling into the evil ways of the world. 
Finally, the Laity of St. Paul was established for married couples as support in 
their vocation.
The Clerks Regular chose the Church of St. Barnabas in Rome as their home 
and thus became known as the Barnabites. Their main apostolate was to pro-
mote the sacred liturgy and the sacraments, and to that end, Anthony started 
a devotion of exposing the Blessed Sacrament on the altars of churches for 
three days, known today as the Forty Hours’ Devotion. This custom was inau-
gurated in the United States by St. John Neumann (see Chapter 11).
Anthony practiced severe asceticism — rigorous self-denial and self-
mortification — and it took a toll on his health. He caught a fever while 
preaching a mission in 1539 and died a short time later.
Pope Leo XIII canonized him, and a shrine in his honor is in the Convent of 
St. Paul’s in Milan, Italy.
St. Augustine of Canterbury
Canterbury, England (unknown–AD 605)
Patron: Canterbury; England; Great Britain
Feast day: May 27
Augustine was a Benedictine monk and prior of a monastery near Rome. 
Pope Gregory the Great became aware of Augustine’s gifts and talents and 
appointed him to missionary work in England. Because of several wars and 
pagan invasions, England was, at the time, divided into factions of small 
Christian religious communities.
Christians in England asked the pope to send more missionaries, and 
Augustine was chosen to lead them. The pope sent many things with 
Augustine to use in reestablishing the Church, including relics, sacred ves-
sels, altar furnishings, vestments, and books. After Augustine baptized the 
English king, he returned to France to be ordained a bishop.

200
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Augustine then founded a new see and built a monastery and church at the 
site where the Canterbury Cathedral now stands. He also established the 
diocese of London and Rochester and had to deal with the remnant Catholic 
Church that had been exiled to Cornwall and Wales by pagan invasions. 
Augustine’s hope of reuniting this group with his reinvigorated church ulti-
mately failed, but through his work and the missionaries that were sent by 
Rome, the Catholic Church now had a strong foundation in England.
St. Bernadine of Siena
Italy (1380–1444)
Canonized: 1450
Patron: advertisers, people with chest problems, gambling addicts, public 
relations personnel, and the diocese of San Bernardino, California
Feast day: May 20
St. Bernadine was born on September 8, the same date as the Virgin Mary, so 
his birth date held a special significance to him. That date served as his bap-
tismal date, the day he was invested with the Franciscan habit, and the day of 
his ordination.
Information about the first 12 years of Bernadine’s religious life is scarce, 
except that he lived the strict observance of the Franciscans, a movement 
within the broader order. Apparently, one of his religious brothers had a 
vision that Father Bernadine was to go and preach to the region of Lombardy.
Wherever he went, Bernadine preached of repentance and turning away from 
vices. He spread the devotion to Jesus’s holy name and used the term IHS to 
denote his name — IHS being the first letters of Jesus’s name in Greek, which 
was later translated to Latin. Drawn rays of sunshine emanate from the ini-

Bernadine preached throughout Italy. When he took the habit of the strict 
observance of St. Francis, the order had only 300 men; his preaching was so 
powerful and successful that at the time of his death, the order had grown to 
4,000 men.
St. Bernadine was canonized by Pope Nicholas V and is buried in Aquila, 
Italy, the last place he preached.

St. Bruno
Germany (1030–1101)
Canonized: 1623
Patron: Ruthenia, victims of demonic possession
Feast day: October 6
As chancellor of the church in Rheims, France, Bruno witnessed many 
abuses and worldliness in the clergy, including those involving Archbishop 
Manasses of Rheims, who appointed him to his post. He reported what he 
saw and an investigation ensued; Archbishop Manasses was quite clever, 
however, and was returned to his see. Bruno and his clerical companions 
who challenged the archbishop were persecuted.
Bruno wanted to retire and devote himself entirely to religious life, and he 
went on to found the Carthusian Order in Chartreuse, France. Pope Urban II 
heard of Bruno’s piety and called him to Rome to help him in Church govern-
ment. Bruno recognized obedience to one’s legitimate superior as a virtue 
and set out for Rome. He created a hermitage and worked on reforms in cleri-
cal life for the pope.
When Bruno was ready for a more secluded religious life, the pope granted 
him permission to go to Calabria, Italy. He developed two monasteries in the 
area and continued communication with his monastery in Chartreuse.
St. Cajetan
Italy (1480–1547)
Beatified: 1629
Canonized: 1671
Patron: the unemployed and job seekers
Feast day: August 7
Cajetan was born with the name “Gaetano” in Vicenza, Italy, and lived during 
a time of great political and religious upheaval. He was sent to Padua, where 
he received a doctorate in law and worked under Pope Julius II in the proto-
notary office (the church equivalent of a notary public). When Julius died, 
Gaetano resigned his office and studied for the priesthood. He was ordained 
in 1516 and took the name Cajetan.

202
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
He worked for the restoration of clergy by reviving an association of priests 
called Divine Love. This group worked among the poor and in hospitals.
Cajetan returned to Vicenza and, recognizing the need for reform in the 
Church, worked with other priests to establish the Congregation of Clerks 
Regular, known as the Theatines. The Theatines’ mission was to revive spirit 
and zeal in the clergy, as Cajetan believed that no true reform could take 
place in the Church until the priests reformed themselves.
He died on August 7, 1547, in Naples, Italy, and was canonized in 1671 by 
Pope Clement X.
St. Casimir
Poland (1458–1484)
Canonized: 1522
Patron: Poland and Lithuania
Feast day: March 4
Casimir was the third eldest child of King Casimir IV and Elizabeth of 
Austria — daughter of Emperor Albert II — and was the grand duke of 
Lithuania. Very early in his life, he committed himself to chastity and celi-
bacy and worked tirelessly for the poor. He influenced his father and older 
brother to distribute alms.
Casimir reluctantly obeyed his father and accepted the throne in Hungary. 
He was forced into politics at a time when the people of Hungary were tired 
of their lax king, and the Muslim Ottoman Empire was threatening to enter 
Christendom through Hungary. But Casimir’s army was outnumbered, and 
he returned to Poland. His father wasn’t pleased and imprisoned his son in a 
castle outside Kraków.
During his imprisonment, Casimir’s faith, asceticism, and devotion to God 
blossomed. He was eventually trained in political affairs and, during his 
father’s travels, ruled Poland in a prudent and judicious manner. He died 
of tuberculosis on March 4, 1484, and is buried in the cathedral Vilna in 
Lithuania.
St. Charles Borromeo
Italy (1538–1584)
Beatified: 1602

203
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
Canonized: 1610
Patron: catechists, catechumens, seminarians, and the diocese of 
Monterey, California; invoked against abdominal pain, intestinal disor-
ders, stomach diseases, and ulcers
Feast day: November 4
Charles was named cardinal-deacon by his uncle, Pope Pius IV. Upon the 
death of his father, Count Gilberto Borromeo, he inherited money, land, and 
the title of count, all of which he renounced so he could be ordained a priest. 
He was soon ordained Archbishop of Milan.
Charles worked tirelessly with his uncle at the Council of Trent. When Pius IV 
died, the new pope, Pius V, retained Charles Borromeo. He worked on many 
of the deliberations of the council during the Church’s Reformation, while 
personally working on the reformation of liturgy and sacrament as well as the 
establishment of the catechism of the Council of Trent.
 
Along with Pope St. Pius V, St. Philip Neri, and Ignatius of Loyola, the 
Church was armed with the renewed spirit of reform, known as the Counter-
Reformation. Still, Charles wanted to work in his diocese; years of neglect had 
taken a toll on the archdiocese of Milan. He started his reforms in 1566 by 
implementing the deliberations of the Council of Trent, and then he regulated 
clerical life by establishing rectories — residences for priests. He founded 
seminaries for the training of priests and spent his life and fortune on the 
people of Milan.
St. Columban
Italy (AD 540–AD 615)
Patron: bookbinders, poets, and against floods
Feast day: November 23
Columban was born to Irish nobility in the sixth century and traveled with 
a small band to Iona, Scotland, and then on to France. He was ordained and 
founded monasteries throughout Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and France, and he 
adopted the rule of St. Benedict in all of them.
The rule — or regula in Latin — refers to the disciplines used to keep order in 
a religious community. The rule delineates who’s in charge and of what, and 
it defines what the members can and can’t do in everyday life. St. Benedict’s 
rule is one of the oldest and simplest in that it centers on two aspects — 
prayer and work (ora et labora).

204
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
In addition to St. Columban’s rule for monastic living, he wrote a number of 
letters and poetry. He died on November 23, AD 615, in Bobbio, Italy, where 
his monastery became a bastion of faith and learning. His body is preserved 
in the abbey church at Bobbio.
St. Eusebius of Vercelli
Sardinia (AD 283–AD 371)
Patron: the diocese of Vercelli, Italy
Feast day: August 2
Eusebius was instituted as a lector in Rome before eventually going to 
Vercelli in northern Italy to become the region’s first bishop. While he was 
Bishop of Vercelli, the Arian heresy was infiltrating the Church. In response, 
Pope Liberius sent Bishop Eusebius to ask the emperor to convene a council 
to return the heretics to Catholicism.
The synod was held in Milan in AD 355, but Eusebius saw that the tide had 
turned and that reconciliation wasn’t imminent. The emperor refused to 
accept the decrees of the Council of Nicea and condemned St. Athanasius. 
The emperor expected all bishops to sign this condemnation, but Eusebius 
refused, believing in the innocence of Athanasius and the validity of the 
Council of Nicea.
(Athanasius was the opponent of Arius, who denied the divinity of Christ. 
Nicea vindicated Athanasius and condemned Arius.)
Eusebius was then exiled to Palestine. After the ascension of the new 
emperor, exiled bishops were allowed to return to their sees. Eusebius met 
with Athanasius in Alexandria to work on clarifying other Christological 
doctrine.
Eusebius eventually returned to Vercelli and died there on August 1, AD 371.
St. Francis of Paola
Calabria, Italy (1416–1502)
Canonized: 1519
Patron: Calabria (a region in Italy), boatmen, mariners, and naval officers
Feast day: April 2

205
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
Francis was educated by Franciscan priests and established the Franciscan 
Order of Minim Friars, a type of hermit, in 1492. The strict observance of the 
rule of St. Francis attracted many to his new monastery in Cosenza.
Francis was known for his holiness and as a miracle worker. When King Louis 
XI of France became gravely ill, he summoned Francis, who initially refused. 
The king beseeched the pope to intercede, and Francis felt compelled to 
obey. He traveled to France and prepared the king for death.
Upon the king’s death, Francis wanted to return to Italy, but the new king 
wouldn’t allow him to leave, wanting Francis to stay in France because of his 
holiness.
Francis died at the age of 91 in France. French Protestants broke into 
Francis’s tomb in 1562 and found his body incorrupt, or non-decayed. They 
burned his body, and devout Catholics retrieved fragments of his bones for 
veneration.
St. Jerome Emiliani
Italy (1481–1537)
Beatified: 1747
Canonized: 1767
Patron: orphans, abandoned people, and Taos Indians
Feast day: February 8
Like most men of his social status at the time, Jerome started his career in 
the military in the Republic of Venice. Venice’s power was then being chal-
lenged, and there was a call to arms.
Jerome was captured in the northern Italian town of Treviso and jailed. While 
in prison, he had time to reflect on his worldly life, which was fairly devoid 
of God. At a church in Treviso, at the altar of Our Lady, Jerome laid down his 
arms and consecrated his life to the Mother of God.
Jerome was ordained a priest in 1518 and devoted himself to the sick, the 
poor, orphans, and victims of the plague. His apostolate attracted other men 
to join in his works, and he founded a new congregation of men, the Clerks 
Regular of Somascha, known as the Somaschi Fathers. They were dedicated 
to the poor and often preached in the fields where the peasants worked.
He caught a fever on one of his preaching expeditions to the fields and died 
in Somascha in 1537.

St. John Baptist de la Salle
France (1651–1719)
Beatified: 1888
Canonized: 1900
Patron: educators, teachers of youth, and school principals
Feast day: April 7
John was born to parents of noble origins, and upon their death, he donated 
his inheritance to the poor. He studied for the priesthood and was ordained 
in 1678. John became interested in the education of poor children early on in 
his priestly life and established a new religious community, the Brothers of 
Christian Schools, which was devoted to teaching.
John’s new community soon became the largest teaching order in the post-
Reformation Church. Schools sprouted up throughout France, all dedicated 
to the education of poor boys. The brothers used the native language of the 
countries they were living in rather than teach the courses in Latin.
Secular schools felt threatened, and John Baptist and his community faced 
great opposition. The perseverance of the community grew, and so did the 
construction of its schools.
One major change to the apostolate happened when King James II of England, 
exiled in France, wanted a school built for his sons and gentry alike. John 
drew up a manual for his school that set the standard for all Christian 
Brothers schools in terms of following a certain curriculum and code of 
conduct.
John’s principal shrine is located in Rome at the de la Salle Generalate.
St. John Cantius (Kanty)
Poland (1390–1473)
Beatified: 1676
Canonized: 1767
Patron: Lithuania and Poland
Feast day: December 23

207
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
John taught Scripture at the University of Kraków and was a noted profes-
sor, which caused jealousy among the other professors. Already an ordained 
priest, he was reassigned to a parish. He was nervous about the administra-
tive tasks of the pastor, and at first, the people in his parish didn’t like him. 
John persevered, however, and his solemn celebration of the Mass and excel-
lent preaching and teaching changed the parishioners’ attitudes. When he 
was sent back to the university to teach Scripture, his parishioners didn’t 
want him to go.
John was a great friend of the poor, often distributing his own food, materi-
als, and money to them. So humble was he that, when traveling on pilgrimage 
to Rome, he walked all the way, carrying his few possessions on his back.
He died at the age of 83. A religious community founded in Chicago, the St. 
John Cantius Society, is named after him. This society is devoted to the resto-
ration of the Latin liturgy, and its members celebrate the extraordinary form 
of the Mass — the Mass that was used before the Second Vatican Council.
St. John of Capistrano
Italy (1386–1456)
Beatified: 1650
Canonized: 1690
Patron: judges, jurists, military chaplains, and the Spanish-American 
Catholic Mission in San Juan Capistrano, California
Feast day: October 23
As a young man, John studied law at the University of Perugia and was even-
tually elected governor of the region. All of Italy was undergoing political and 
economic change and hardship; one city-state was at war with another.
John was captured and imprisoned, giving him time to reflect on his life. His 
marriage was dissolved because it had never been consummated, and he 
decided to enter the Franciscan Order.
John was ordained into the priesthood in 1420 and became known as a pow-
erful orator. Emperor Frederick III called upon his talents to preach against a 
heretic religious group, the Hussites, that was flourishing in central Europe. 
The group originated in Prague and was led by reformer John Huss. Although 
Huss was condemned and put to death as a heretic, his movement lived on, 
but John of Capistrano’s powerful preaching brought people back to the 
Church.

208
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Catholic Europe was under great threat with the fall of Constantinople at 
the hands of the Muslim Turks. Pope Nicholas V called upon John to lead 
a crusade against the Turks, and he preached to the people of Austria and 
Hungary, exhorting them to come to arms. The Turks were deterred, at least 
for a time.
John became ill on the battlefields where he was administering the sacra-
ments, celebrating Holy Mass, and preaching. He died on October 23, 1456.
St. Josemaria Escriva
Rome, Italy (1902–1975)
Beatified: 1992
Canonized: 2002
Patron: lay workers
Feast day: June 26
By the time he was 15, Josemaria had seen three of his sisters die as chil-
dren and his father go through bankruptcy. Feeling called to the priesthood, 
he went to the seminary, earned degrees in theology and civil law, and was 
ordained in 1925.
 
While a parish priest, Josemaria discerned the Lord calling him further, and 
he founded Opus Dei, Latin for work of God. Nearly 35 years before the Second 
Vatican Council would even use the phrase “universal call to holiness,” Jose-
maria conceptualized it and founded Opus Dei as a means by which ordinary 
Catholic Christians could sanctify their entire lives by sanctifying their daily 
work.
During the Middle Ages, the peasants thought that only the monks and nuns 
were capable of holiness, whereas the common folk (non-nobility) had to 
settle for a watered-down version of monastic spirituality. Monastic life cen-
tered on work and prayer, while secular life had lots of work but little time 
for prayer.
Instead of going to the chapel whenever the bell rang (as the monks and nuns 
had to do each day), Josemaria meditated on the lives of St. Joseph and the 
Virgin Mary, the two holiest people next to Jesus Christ himself. Joseph and 
his wife were humble, simple folk. They spent most of their day doing manual 
labor. As faithful Jews, Joseph and Mary did go to synagogue or temple, but 
not daily. It just wasn’t practical to do so.

209
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
Likewise, Josemaria thought, one’s personal holiness isn’t solely contingent 
on how much time one spends in holy places, but rather on how much of the 
daily work is consecrated to God. While daily prayer is absolutely essential, 
so is making your daily work a “prayer.” Josemaria discovered that if you do 
your best at whatever your regular job entails and dedicate your best effort 
to God, then that work is made holy.
St. Martin of Tours
Upper Pannonia, Hungary (AD 316–AD 397)
Patron: beggars, equestrians, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard; invoked 
against alcoholism, impoverishment, and poverty
Feast day: November 11
Opus Dei: Secret society?
Today, 97 percent of Opus Dei is laymen and 
women who work in ordinary careers doing 
ordinary things. While all devout Catholic 
Christians, their sole mission is to sanctify the 
world, as Christ commanded, by doing their 
daily work well and doing it for the Lord. The 
3 percent who are clergy are ordained priests 
who came from the ranks of the laity as mem-
bers of Opus Dei.
Of the 97 percent lay members of Opus Dei, 80 
percent are supernumeraries — married men 
and women who have secular careers and 
live ordinary lives at home with their families. 
Numeraries, who make up the other 20 percent, 
are laymen and women who live celibate lives 
together (non-coed) and who donate most of 
their secular income to sustain the apostolates 
of Opus Dei.
The 1983 Code of Canon Law (the body of eccle-
siastical laws that govern the internal opera-
tions of the Catholic Church) created an entity 
called a personal prelature, and Opus Dei was 
the first such organization. It merely means that 
the members follow an Opus Dei bishop in the 
same way that most lay Catholics are under the 
leadership of the local diocesan bishop.
Unlike the caricature of Opus Dei found in some 
recent movies, it’s not a secret organization 
of the Catholic Church, and it doesn’t contain 
albino monks, assassins, or spies. However, it 
does have lots of moms and dads, lawyers, doc-
tors, plumbers, cops, firefighters, and teach-
ers. The so-called secrecy of the prelature is 
nothing more than humble discretion and pru-
dence. Unlike the clergy (bishops, priests, and 
deacons) and the consecrated religious (nuns, 
sisters, brothers, monks, friars, and so on) who 
work for the Church and must be accountable 
to it, laymen and women live private lives. They 
don’t wear their religion or their membership in 
Opus Dei on their sleeve; they merely do their 
ordinary work at their secular jobs. They don’t 
hide their religion or spirituality, but neither do 
they advertise or proselytize it. Evangelization 
occurs by example and witness rather than by 
debate.

210
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Born to pagan parents in what is now Hungary, Martin studied and converted 
to Christianity at the age of 10. He became a soldier and served in the emper-
or’s army.
When Martin was a soldier, he visited Amiens in present-day France. It was a 
cold morning, and at the city gate stood a beggar — cold, hungry, and with 
very few clothes. Martin didn’t have much to offer, because soldiers were 
poorly paid. He got off his horse and offered what he had: half his cape.
Observing the tearing of his cloak in half, some made fun of him, while others 
felt guilty that they didn’t do their part in helping a poor old man. As the 
story continued that night, Martin had a dream in which Christ the Lord 
came to him dressed in the remnants of his cloak. The story reflects the ways 
in which Christians are known for their good actions.
Martin continued as a soldier, and after a successful campaign, the emperor 
was ready to pay him fairly well, but Martin refused and wanted to be 
released from the army. This angered the emperor, because Martin was a 
good soldier, and he imprisoned Martin on charges of treason with hopes 
that he would change his mind. He was eventually released to St. Hilary of 
Poitiers, France.
Martin wanted to live a quiet life as a hermit and began the first monastery 
in this area. Upon the death of the Bishop of Tours, the people wanted him 
to become their new bishop. He preferred to remain a quiet monk, but he 
accepted the call to become their bishop. Through his preaching, teaching, 
and fine holy example, he won over many from paganism. Idols and temples 
were soon destroyed, and Catholic churches were built.
At the same time, many heretical groups began to form over confusion in 
doctrine. One such group was the Priscillianists — a Gnostic, Manichean reli-
gious sect. Martin successfully preached against this heresy, but when the 
emperor condemned members to death, Martin pleaded for leniency.
St. Nicholas of Bari
Turkey (AD 270–AD 346)
Patron: sailors, children in the West, fishermen, merchants, the falsely 
accused, prostitutes, repentant thieves, and pawnbrokers
Feast day: December 6
Nicholas was Bishop of Myra in Asia Minor. In his time, girls couldn’t marry 
unless they had a proper endowment. One man, the father of three girls, lost 

211
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
all his money and was going to sell his daughters into prostitution. Nicholas 
heard this, and in the middle of the night, he took a sack of gold, enough for 
the eldest daughter to marry, and threw it through the open window of the 
man’s house. He also did this for the other two daughters, and the father 
made it a point to see who this generous benefactor was.
 
As the legend grew, St. Nicholas became Sinter Klaas in Dutch and Santa Claus 
in English. The jolly old St. Nicholas mentioned in many Christmas carols is 
actually St. Nicholas of Bari. However, the present-day secular representation 
has little to do with the real St. Nicholas. He didn’t wear a red-and-white suit, 
nor did he have a sleigh and eight reindeer. These were elements of the mythi-
cal “Father Christmas” that became identified with St. Nicholas after European 
immigrants came to the New World. The real St. Nick did dress as a bishop of 
his time, did many good deeds, and performed many miracles for children, 
whom he loved and cherished dearly.
He is revered among the Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches for his 
defense of the Christian faith against the many heresies plaguing the Church 
in the third and fourth centuries, especially Arianism. He is patron of sailors 
because, according to legend, sailors in the Mediterranean Sea invoked his 
name during storms, and the saint guided them safely to port. His feast is 
kept with great solemnity and festivity in Nordic countries.
During the Muslim takeover of many Christian cities and sites in the eastern 
Mediterranean, the relics of St. Nicholas were successfully moved in the 11th 
century to Bari, Italy, where they are today. A magnificent basilica was built 
in his honor in this port city. He was greatly revered among the Russians as 
the defender of orthodoxy, so much so that, until the Communist Revolution, 
Russians would travel to Bari on pilgrimage.
St. Patrick
Britain (AD 387–AD 461)
Patron: Ireland, many dioceses throughout the English-speaking world, 
and engineers; invoked against the fear of snakes and snakebites
Feast day: March 17
Patrick was born just south of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, which was part of the 
Roman Empire. He was captured by Irish pagans in his early teens and taken 
to Ireland, where he was enslaved for six years. During that time, he grew to 
like the spirit of the Irish. When he escaped and returned to his family, he 
vowed to one day return to Ireland.

212
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
He studied at monasteries on the continent and was eventually ordained a 
priest and then a bishop. Pope Celestine I commissioned Patrick to be an 
apostle to Ireland.
Patrick initially encountered many hardships among the pagans, particu-
larly the druids. They weren’t willing to give up their power over the old 
religion and feared Patrick and Christianity. Although the ruling monarch, 
King Laoghaire, didn’t convert to Christianity, many of his family members 
did, and little by little, the old religion began to fade. Patrick traveled from 
town to town, tearing down idols and temples and establishing the Catholic 
Church. By AD 444, the primatial see and first cathedral of Ireland were built 
in Armagh.
He baptized, confirmed, and ordained priests, and he erected schools and 
monasteries. Thousands came into the Church under his direction. He 
accomplished all these activities in less than 30 years, during which time 
the whole island nation of Ireland was converted. Toward the end of his life, 
he wrote Confessions, in which he gives a record of his life and mission. He 
died on March 17, AD 461, of natural causes. He is buried in Downpatrick in 
present-day Northern Ireland.
 
Many stories are told in connection with St. Patrick. The three-leaf clover 
was said to be used by the saintly bishop to explain the Blessed Trinity to 
the pagans. Another legend has Patrick driving all the snakes out of Ireland; 
snakes were a popular symbol among the Irish pagans. He is certainly one 
of the most revered saints in the Catholic Church. The famous prayer, 
“St. Patrick’s Breastplate,” is attributed to him.
St. Paul of the Cross
Italy (1694–1775)
Beatified: 1853
Canonized: 1867
Patron: Ovada, Italy
Feast day: October 19
Paul developed a devotion to the sacred passion of Christ very early on in 
his life, instilled first by his mother, who taught him to spiritualize pain and 
inconveniences he encountered.

213
 Chapter 14: Saintly Pastors
Paul received a vision when he was a young man that inspired him to estab-
lish a new congregation of priests, the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus 
Christ, commonly known as the Passionists, in 1720. The new community 
devoted itself to preaching missions in parishes and giving retreats in semi-
naries, houses of formation, and monasteries. Toward the end of his life, Paul 
also founded a cloistered, contemplative community of religious women, 
known as the Passionist Nuns.
Today, many shrines throughout Europe and in America are staffed by 
Passionists, including the famous shrine of St. Gabriel of the Passion in the 
Abruzzi Mountains in Italy and, in the U.S., the Shrine of St. Ann in Scranton, 
Pennsylvania. In addition, these priests work in various monasteries and 
retreat centers.
Paul’s major shrine, which contains his relics, is the Church of St. John and 
Paul in Rome.
St. Vincent Ferrer
Spain (1350–1419)
Canonized: 1455
Patron: builders, construction workers, plumbers, brick makers, and tile 
makers
Feast day: April 5
Vincent had a great love for the poor and often shared what little he had with 
them. He entered the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans, and 
was ordained a priest. Soon he became a scholarly man and received a doc-
torate. He was well versed in philosophy, theology, and Sacred Scripture. It is 
said that he had a vision of St. Dominic and St. Francis early in his priesthood 
and from that time on had many mystical experiences.
His great knowledge would soon be put to good use. During the Western 
(Papal) Schism of 1378–1417, three men claimed at the same time to be pope. 
Vincent began to preach the unity of the Church throughout Europe. He 
begged the anti-popes to resign in order to preserve this unity. This was no 
easy task. Anti-Pope Benedict XIII, who held court in Avignon, France, was 
counseled by Vincent to end the schism.

214
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
 
Vincent advised King Castile of Spain to withdraw his support of the Avignon 
anti-pope, which ended the usurped reign of Benedict. The resignation of the 
authentic pope and the deposing of the two anti-popes paved the way for the 
election of the true successor to St. Peter, which would be Vincent’s greatest 
legacy.
Several miracles were attributed to the saint before and after his death. The 
major shrine is in the city of Vannes (in France) in the Vannes Cathedral, 
where his remains are buried.

Chapter 15
Latin Fathers of the Church
In This Chapter
▶ St. Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin
▶ Other important Latin Fathers of the Church
T
his chapter focuses on those saints who are designated Latin Fathers of 
the Church. These scholars helped mold and shape the early Christian 
Church, and because of their theological influence and their historical place 
in antiquity, they’ve earned the title Church Father.
 
The Church Fathers in this chapter are called Latin to differentiate them 
from their contemporary Eastern or Byzantine Church Fathers. Constantine 
established the imperial city Constantinople (formerly Byzantium) when he 
became Roman Emperor in the fourth century. He created the city to serve 
as a second Rome of sorts, giving the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church 
two regions — east and west. The eastern provinces were governed by Con-
stantinople, while Rome remained in charge of the western area. The pope 
was the head of the Church, assisted by patriarchs of Jerusalem, Alexandria, 
Antioch, and Constantinople.
The Latin writings from the early Church are from the western Church 
Fathers; the eastern Church Fathers were more comfortable using Greek, the 
language of the eastern empire. (We discuss the Greek Fathers in Chapter 16.)
St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan
Trier (Germany) (AD 340–AD 397)
Patron: beekeepers, candle makers
Feast day: December 7

216
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Ambrose was named Bishop of Milan out of a violent controversy follow-
ing the death of Auxentius. Having not yet been baptized, Ambrose worked 
unsuccessfully to decline the bishopric; the emperor insisted that Ambrose 
be baptized and ordained on the same day, December 7, AD 347.
During his reign as bishop, Ambrose vigorously fought for the independence 
of the Church and defended it against imperial control and influence. He’s 
best known for the quote ubi petrus ibi ecclesia, which is Latin for “where 
Peter is, there is the Church.” In other words, wherever the pope, the succes-
sor of St. Peter, is teaching or speaking authoritatively, he is speaking for the 
entire Catholic Church.
 
Ambrose struggled against Arianism, a heresy that maintained that although 
Christ is similar to God the Father, he’s not God’s equal. Arianism further held 
that God adopted Jesus as his son and gave him divine-like abilities. In its 
early days, Christianity condemned those beliefs as heretical. The teaching 
now is that Christ is the second person of the Holy Trinity (God the Father, 
God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit). Therefore, Jesus is both God and man; 
divine and human. He is one divine person but has both a full and complete 
divine nature and a full and complete human nature.
St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo
Thagaste, Numidia (Algeria) (AD 354–AD 430)
Patron: philosophers, printers
Feast day: August 28
What does it take to be named a Church Father?
One isn’t named a Church Father simply by 
participating in the formation of the Christian 
Church, though that’s certainly among the list 
of qualifications. In fact, there are four requi-
sites to earning the title Church Father. To be 
considered, one must have
 ✓ Lived when the Church was in its youth, in 
the first through sixth centuries
 ✓ Led a saintly life not tainted by scandal or 
secrets
 ✓ Had writings free from heresies while 
excelling in the explanation and defense of 
Catholic doctrine
 ✓ Had writings that bore the seal of the 
Church, indicating approval

217
 Chapter 15: Latin Fathers of the Church
Augustine is also one of the Doctors of the Church (see Chapter 13) in addi-
tion to being a Latin Father. The playboy son of a pagan father and a devout 
Christian mother, Augustine first lived a decadent life of hedonism where 
he sought to satiate every whim and craving. Much like the ancient sect of 
Epicureans from Roman antiquity, young Augustine lived life in the fast lane.
Fortunately, in early middle age, after having a son out of wedlock, he real-
ized how transitory earthly life and pleasures actually are. He went from one 
extreme to the other, going from playboy to puritan. Augustine embraced a 
rigorous life and philosophy of Manichaeism, which saw the material world 
as evil and only the spiritual as good. That meant that the body and all physi-
cal pleasures were sinful.
With the help of the constant prayers of his mother, St. Monica (see Chapter 
4), and the tutelage of St. Ambrose (see Chapter 13), Augustine cleaned up 
his act and was baptized a Christian. Due to his intellectual abilities and 
education, he soon got ordained a priest and then a bishop. His command of 
language and philosophy was so great that the medieval genius, St. Thomas 
Aquinas (see Chapter 13), admired him with awe and great respect.
His writings repudiating the heresy of Pelagianism are still studied today. 
Pelagius maintained that a human soul could earn or merit its way into 
heaven all by itself. Augustine taught that man can do nothing on his own but 
sin. Every good work must be animated and inspired by divine grace. When a 
soul accepts and cooperates with God’s grace, then all things are possible.
St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage
Carthage (North Africa) (AD 200–AD 258)
Feast day: September 16
Cyprian, a pagan lawyer, teacher, and rhetorician, was converted to 
Christianity in AD 246 and became well versed in the Bible as well as the 
writings of Tertullian (a Church Father who started out as the shining star of 
Christian faith, only to later fall into heresy). His theology of the supremacy 
of papal teaching authority (on matters of faith and morals) would be further 
refined by St. Ambrose after him. Cyprian also believed in papal primacy — 
the concept that the pope has supreme jurisdiction in all Church matters. 
Under Cyprian’s defense of papal primacy, he believed that each parish 
would still have the pastor as its spiritual leader, and a geographical area of 
parishes would be under the care of the bishop as spiritual shepherd. The 
role of the pope would be supervisory as well as symbolic — that is, one 
leader representing a universal church, making decisions regarding doctrine 
or discipline to be followed by believers around the world.

218
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
St. Cyprian also rebuked the priest Novatus for his leniency on those who 
had renounced their religion during the Roman persecutions and then 
returned seeking reconciliation. Although he believed in God’s mercy in 
allowing reconciliation, Cyprian didn’t want to trivialize the offense, instead 
seeing the rejection of Christ and the Church as a serious sin and advocat-
ing an appropriate penance. Cyprian stood in the middle of two extreme 
positions: those in favor of leniency who required the former apostates to 
go to confession, and those who believed that after one left the Church, for-
giveness required a renewed baptism. Cyprian’s position held that the lapsi, 
those who left the Church, would be readmitted after some public profession 
of faith and a public penance.
Pope St. Gregory the Great
Rome, Italy (AD 540–AD 604)
Canonized: AD 604
Declared a Doctor of the Church: 1298
Patron: educators, musicians, singers, popes, and those suffering from 
the gout
Feast day: September 3
Gregory’s dad was a wealthy patrician (Gordianus) who owned large estates 
in Sicily and a mansion in Rome. His mom (Silvia) is recognized as a saint, 
and her feast day is November 3. Two of his aunts (his father’s sisters, 
Tarsilla and Aemiliana) are also canonized saints.
After a short career in politics serving the empire, Gregory became a monk 
at the age of 34. Four years later, he was called out of the monastery and 
was ordained one of the seven deacons of Rome by the Pope and sent to 
Byzantium (Constantinople) to seek the aid of the Eastern Emperor in defend-
ing Rome from the Lombards.
Returning to Rome in 586, he was made Abbot of St. Andrew’s Monastery. He 
happily enjoyed monastic life, but only for four years. Pope Pelagius II died in 
590, and the clergy and citizenry of Rome unanimously elected Gregory the 
next pope. He tried to escape, feeling himself unworthy of this honor. The 
people found him trying to leave Rome dressed as a poor pilgrim. Confronted 
with his destiny and divine providence, Gregory agreed and reigned until his 
death in AD 604.
As pope, Gregory reformed the sacred liturgy and standardized parts of the 
Mass and promoted the use of sacred music in divine worship. He also wrote 

219
 Chapter 15: Latin Fathers of the Church
extensively on the faith and was very interested in missionary work. Gregory 
sent St. Augustine of Canterbury to establish the Catholic faith in Britain.
He was the first pope to use the title “Servant of the Servants of God,” 
seeing the papacy as a ministry and not just a position of honor and power. 
Gregory did much to improve the office of pope by getting involved in spiri-
tual, liturgical (Gregorian chant is named after him), as well as political and 
secular issues. He is also known for his repudiation of Patriarch Eutyches of 
Constantinople who denied the palpability of the resurrected body. Gregory 
retorted that the body of the Risen Christ was not ethereal but had substance 
as proved when Jesus asked Thomas to touch his hands and feet, and the 
times when the Resurrected Lord ate with his disciples.
St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons
Smyrna, Asia Minor (AD 130–AD 200)
Feast day: June 28
During his reign as Bishop of Lyons, Irenaeus fought against Gnosticism, 
a heresy based on the belief that a secret to salvation exists that only the 
seeker — the Gnostic — can discover. Gnosticism contradicts the Judeo-
Christian belief in public revelation, where God reveals the truth to everyone. 
It also denies the necessity of a divine grace for salvation. Gnosticism holds 
that only knowledge can bring true happiness, and it has no place for a per-
sonal relationship with God.
Irenaeus countered that revelation is meant for everyone and that truth 
doesn’t belong just with the educated elite. Jesus sent the Apostles to travel 
the world over to spread the Good News; according to Gnosticism, its follow-
ers hide in secret locations vowing to keep new information to themselves. 
Irenaeus preached often on exposing the philosophical and theological inad-
equacies and inconsistencies of Gnosticism so his people would be open to 
the liberating message of the Christian Gospel.
St. Jerome
Stridon, Dalmatia (AD 343–AD 420)
Patron: librarians, bible scholars, translators
Feast day: September 30

220
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Eusebius Hieronymous Sophronius was baptized “Jerome” in AD 360 by 
Pope Liberius and was taught by Donatus, a famous pagan grammarian, and 
Victorinus, a Christian rhetorician.
Jerome sought to live a life of prayer as a hermit, partially because he knew 
living with others would be difficult. As a pagan, he could be a formidable 
and aggressive opponent in verbal arguments, both intellectually and emo-
tionally. Because he could also get too intense, Jerome left the temptations of 
the community and lived a life free from annoyance. Pope Damasus refused 
to leave this brilliant scholar to his solitude, instead commissioning Jerome 
to translate the first volume of the Christian Bible. Before then, each book of 
the Old Testament and the New Testament had been written as a separate 
piece in either Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek. Jerome was the first person to 
incorporate all 46 books of the Jewish Septuagint (Greek translation of the 
Old Testament) and all 27 books of the Christian Scriptures into one whole 
collection.
 
It took Jerome almost 18 years to fully translate all the books of the Bible 
into one language and volume, using Latin, the official language of the Roman 
Empire and the language used by the masses. St. Jerome’s Latin translation of 
the Old and New Testament is called the Vulgate because it was done in the 
common tongue (vulgata) of his time. It’s considered the first complete Bible, 
bringing all the parts of previous translations into one volume. Jerome was 
also the first to use the word bible to describe the complete collection of both 
the Old and New Testaments in one volume. Biblia in Latin comes from the 
More or less
Take a comparative look at the Catholic and 
typical Protestant Bibles and one notable 
difference appears: The Catholic Bible has 
seven more books in its Old Testament than 
its Protestant counterpart. The Catholic Old 
Testament has 46 books, and the Protestant 
version has just 39; both contain the same 27 
books in the New Testament.
Why the difference?
St. Jerome, who translated the first complete 
Bible into one language in AD 400, used a Greek 
translation of the Hebrew Scriptures called the 
Septuagint. He translated all 27 of the original 
Christian Scriptures from Greek into his native 
Latin, and then he worked on one translation of 
the Old Testament.
During the Babylonian Exile, 7 Old Testa-
ment books — Baruch, Ecclesiasticus (or 
Sirach), Judith, Maccabees 1 and 2, Tobit, and 
Wisdom — and a few sections of Daniel and 
Esther were written only in Greek, the language 
used by exiled Jews, whereas the other 39 Old 
Testament books were written in pre-exile 
times and in Hebrew.

Greek Byblos, meaning “books.” The Bible is in reality a collection of books, 
from Genesis to Revelation.
St. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola
Bordeaux, Gaul (France) (AD 353–AD 431)
Feast day: June 22
Paulinus was the son of Pontius Meropius Anicius Paulinus, a Roman pre-
fect in Gaul. He became a successful lawyer and held public office like his 
father before him. While in Spain he met and married Therasia. Their only 
child died a week after birth. Paulinus was ordained a priest in AD 393 by the 
Bishop of Barcelona.
Paulinus corresponded frequently with St. Augustine and St. Jerome, as well 
as St. Ambrose and St. Martin of Tours. Fifty-one of his letters and thirty-two 
of his poems are still around today. Paulinus wrote on the dignity and sanc-
tity of Christian marriage and promoted veneration (honor) of the saints, 
especially the martyrs and their relics to show appreciation for their sacrifice 
of dying for the faith. He also encouraged others to be as courageous as the 
martyrs were in defending their religion.
St. Peter Chrysologus
Imola, Bologna (Italy) (AD 406–AD 450)
Feast day: July 3
Peter was given the nickname Chrysologus — golden-worded — after preach-
ing an eloquent sermon to Empress Galla Placidia. Bishop Felix of Ravenna 
saved 176 of Peter’s preached sermons in the eighth century.
Peter wrote to Eutyches urging him to abandon his heresy: “We exhort you in 
every respect, honorable brother, to heed obediently what has been written 
by the most blessed pope of the city of Rome; for Blessed Peter, who lives 
and presides in his own see, provides the truth of faith to those who seek 
it.” Eutyches had previously opposed the heresy of Nestorianism but had 
gone to the opposite extreme of Monophysitism, claiming Jesus had only one 
nature (divine) and not two (human and divine).

222
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
St. Vincent of Lérins
Southern Gaul (France) (unknown–AD 450)
Feast day: May 24
Vincent left the life of a soldier to become a monk in Lérins. Little else is 
known of his life, other than a phrase he coined that’s extremely helpful 
in evaluating the authenticity of most things in the Catholic Church: quod 
ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus credituni est (that which has been 
taught everywhere, at all times, in all places, by all authorized teachers).
That phrase has become known as the Vincent canon and is consid-
ered a litmus test for orthodoxy. It can be found in his famous work, the 
Commontorium.

Chapter 16
Greek Fathers of the Church
In This Chapter
▶ Fighting against Arianism and other heresies 
▶ Building the foundation of the Eastern Church
A
fter the Roman Emperor Constantine (fourth century AD) established 
the imperial city of Constantinople (formerly Byzantium, currently 
Istanbul), he divided the empire into two parts, East and West. The Western 
half used the Latin language and the Eastern half used Greek. The Catholic 
Church was unofficially but culturally partitioned between East and West. 
There was one emperor and one pope but two flavors, so to speak. 
So for several hundred years, Christianity was united under one roof, albeit 
with two traditions (Western-Latin and Eastern-Greek). By the 11th century 
(1054), though, the Great Schism had divided East and West into two sepa-
rate churches — Catholic and Orthodox. Later, in the 17th century, several 
Eastern Orthodox communities came back into full communion with the pope 
in Rome, and they’re called Byzantine Catholics or Greek Catholics to distin-
guish them from the Latin Roman Catholics who lived in the West.
Just as learned men from the Western Church became known as the Latin 
Fathers of the Church (see Chapter 15), some equally brilliant scholars from 
the Eastern part of the Church became known as the Greek Fathers. In this 
chapter, we introduce you to these Greek Fathers of the Church, men who 
helped in the formation of the Eastern Catholic Church.
St. Athanasius of Alexandria
Alexandria, Egypt (AD 297–AD 373)
Feast day: May 2

224
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
As an early disciple of St. Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius 
learned right away how to defend the Orthodox teachings of the Catholic 
Church. Alexander was a primary adversary of the Arian heretics at the 
Council of Nicea in AD 325, and Athanasius, an ordained deacon, assisted 
Alexander there. Athanasius followed the lead of St. Alexander and vigorously 
denounced Arianism (heresy that denied the divinity of Christ) whenever he 
could. He was elected Patriarch of Alexandria in AD 326 following 
St. Alexander’s death. 
 
Athanasius was the first to use the word “catholic” prolifically. In Greek, katho-
likos means “universal”; Athanasius injected it into the Christian vocabulary to 
establish a unified religion. (Today, “catholic” with a lowercase “c” still means 
“universal.” When it’s capitalized, it usually refers to the Catholic Church or 
faith.)
Athanasius also wrote a lengthy creed, Quicumque vult (whosoever wishes 
to be saved), to formally address Church doctrine regarding the Holy Trinity 
and the errors of Arianism. The creed endorses the theology of a triune 
monotheism (one God in three persons); Trinitarianism is the foundation of 
Christianity, and anything less — Unitarianism or dualism, for instance — is 
not acceptable. 
St. Basil the Great, Archbishop 
of Caesarea 
Caesarea, Cappadocia (AD 329–AD 379)
Feast day: January 2
Basil grew up surrounded by strong faith: He was the son of St. Basil the 
Elder and St. Emmelia; the grandson of St. Macrina the Elder; and brother to 
SS. Gregory of Nyssa, Macrina the Younger, and Peter of Sebastea.
With such a family lineage, Basil showed holiness at an early age, cooking 
meals for the poor and raising money for them. Though members of nobility 
typically helped the needy indirectly through their servants, Basil preferred 
to “get his hands dirty” and practice his faith. He eventually became a monk 
and is considered the father of Eastern monasticism, just as St. Benedict was 
for the Latin, or Western, Church (see Chapter 15). 
Basil was a champion of the teachings of Nicea (AD 325) and Constantinople I 
(AD 360), and as such, he boldly fought the heresy of Arianism. He was also a 
reformer when he became Bishop of Caesarea in AD 370 in that he punished 

225
 Chapter 16: Greek Fathers of the Church
anyone found guilty of simony — trying to buy or sell spiritual favors — and 
he demanded honesty and integrity from all his clergy. Basil’s followers were 
so fond of his service as bishop, preacher, and teacher that he was known as 
Basil the Great even before he died.
St. Clement of Alexandria 
Athens, Greece (AD 150–AD 215)
Feast day: December 4
Clement was Origen’s teacher at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. He 
made a great contribution in applying Greek philosophical thought to the 
study, defense, and understanding of Christian theology. 
 
Clement’s three great works are Protrepticus (exhortation to the Greeks on 
Christian morality); Paedagogus (instruction on ethical conduct); and Stromata 
(moral miscellanies). His work initiated a breakthrough by which logic and 
philosophy were used to explain and comprehend ideas that flowed from what 
had already been revealed in Scripture.
SS. Cyril and Methodius 
Cyril (Constantine): Thessalonica Greece (AD 827–AD 869)
Methodius: Thessalonica, Greece (AD 826–AD 885)
Feast day: February 14
Cyril (also called Constantine) and his brother Methodius were Greeks from 
Thessalonica. Pope John Paul the Great proclaimed them to be “Apostles to 
the Slavs” and copatrons of Europe — along with St. Benedict of Nursia — for 
their missionary work among the Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe.
Methodius chose to embrace a monastic life, while Cyril, adept in languages 
and with a keen mind for theology, wanted to be a scholar. Cyril corre-
sponded frequently with Jewish and Muslim scholars, trying to bridge the 
gaps among the three great monotheistic religions (Judaism, Islam, and 
Christianity).
 
The Emperor sent Cyril to convert the seminomadic Russian Khazars, and 
Methodius accompanied him. Cyril developed an alphabet called the Cyrillic 
for the Slavonic language, which is still used today in Russia and former Soviet 
nations. 

226
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
Cyril’s and Methodius’s work with language and religion became well known; 
the two were sent to Moravia to unify those people under one language, 
alphabet, and religion. The Germans had been teaching the Moravians Latin, 
but Prince Rastislay (ruler of Moravia) sought independence from German 
influence. 
The brothers firmly believed in using the vernacular of the local people, a 
belief that was in sharp contrast to the customs of the day. In the Western 
empire, Latin was the standard language of law, academics, and church; in 
the Eastern empire, it was Greek across the board. The brothers trained 
men for the priesthood and sent their trainees to Rome to be ordained. The 
German bishops contested their ordination, complaining that the new priests 
didn’t speak Latin. The Pope rejected those arguments, allowed the men to 
be ordained, and gave them permission to use Slavonic in their home par-
ishes as an approved liturgical language. 
 
Cyril died on February 14, AD 869, and that’s the date used for the brothers’ 
feast day, although Methodius outlived his brother by 16 years.
St. Dionysius the Great 
Alexandria, Egypt (AD 190–AD 264)
Feast day: November 17
Dionysius, a disciple of Origen, was born and raised in a pagan family, but as 
a young man, he became very well read and learned. His studies sparked a 
love and curiosity for truth and wisdom, which eventually led to his conver-
sion to Christianity. After he was baptized, he used his intellectual abilities to 
refute heresies and to explain and defend the newfound faith he enjoyed.
He became Bishop and Patriarch of Alexandria and vigorously defended the 
doctrine of the Trinity. Dionysius also battled the heretical Novatians, who 
maintained that the lapsi (Christians who had renounced their faith during 
the Roman persecutions) could never be reconciled back into the Church. 
He believed the mercy of God extended to the lapsi if they repented, made a 
good confession, and did proper penance.
St. Gregory of Nazianzus
Arianzus, near Nazianzus, in Cappadocia, Asia Minor (AD 329–AD 390)
Feast day: January 2

227
 Chapter 16: Greek Fathers of the Church
Like his friend St. Basil, Gregory was raised in a family that would become 
quite holy: The son of St. Gregory of Nazianzus the Elder and St. Nonna, 
he was also a brother to St. Caesar Nazianzen and St. Gorgonia. Gregory’s 
father was a former pagan who went on to become Bishop of Nazianzus. 
When Gregory the Elder was 94, he made his son his co-adjutor bishop — 
the person who automatically ascends to the bishopric at his predecessor’s 
death, resignation, or retirement. 
The younger Gregory was a reluctant cleric at first. He didn’t feel worthy 
of the priesthood, let alone the possibility of becoming bishop. His father 
convinced him, however, what a great asset he would be to both the Church 
and to his father if he were to accept the position. Together they battled the 
Arians, and the younger Gregory was named bishop in AD 370. 
Gregory reluctantly accepted the position of Archbishop of Constantinople in 
AD 381, in the reign of the Emperor Valens, who was a staunch Arian. Valens 
was succeeded two years later by Emperor Theodosius, who was a vigorous 
opponent of Arianism. Gregory became the subject of slander, persecution, 
and physical abuse for his efforts to reunite former Arians with the Church. 
He longed for solitude, away from the politics of the imperial city, and 
resigned his office seven years before he died in his hometown. 
St. Gregory of Nyssa
Caesarea in Cappadocia (AD 330–AD 395)
Feast day: March 9
Gregory was the brother of St. Basil and a friend of St. Gregory Nazianzus 
(see Basil’s and Gregory’s entries earlier in this chapter). A rhetorician by 
trade, he was so disgusted by his students’ apathy that he left teaching to 
become a monk and enjoy the quiet of the monastery.
When Basil became Bishop of Caesarea, he persuaded Gregory to take the 
assignment of Bishop of Nyssa in AD 372. Nyssa was filled with Arians, and 
Gregory attempted to restore the teachings of the Church. Arian Governor 
Demosthenes falsely accused Gregory of mismanaging church property and 
had the bishop imprisoned. Gregory escaped but was deposed, only to be 
reinstated when Emperor Gratian intervened. 
Gregory attended the Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople I 
(AD 381), which reaffirmed the condemnation of Arianism from the First 
Ecumenical Council of Nicea (AD 325). So eloquent was Gregory at this gath-
ering of the bishops that he was called the “Father of the Fathers” for being a 
pillar of orthodoxy and staunch defender of the faith.

228
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
St. Gregory Thaumaturgus
Neocæsarea, Asia Minor (AD 213–AD 270)
Feast day: November 17
Born to wealthy pagans, Gregory and his brother chose to be lawyers, but 
on their way to the academy, the two met Origen and entered his theology 
school in Caesarea. (Origen was one of the most influential, prestigious, and 
premier Greek theologians and philosophers of his day at the turn of the 
third century. His teachings impacted many generations.) There they con-
verted to Christianity.
Gregory still wanted to be a lawyer, and he returned to Neocæsarea in 
AD 238. The 17 Christians of his hometown learned of his conversion and 
elected him their bishop. His preaching was only outdone by his miracu-
lous cures (healing the blind, deaf, lame, and so on), and he was given the 
name Thaumaturgus, which is Greek for “wonder worker.” When the Decian 
persecutions arose in AD 250, he urged his people to go into hiding, and he 
and a deacon fled to the desert for two years. On his return, Gregory had to 
contend with plague and the barbarian invasion of the Goths. Still, he and his 
diocese persevered and survived. 
St. Ignatius of Antioch 
Rome (AD 35–AD 107)
Feast day: October 17
Ignatius was a friend of St. John the Evangelist and the third Bishop of 
Antioch. Some say Ignatius was the young boy Jesus took into his arms in the 
Gospel of Mark 9:35, although no evidence exists to substantiate this claim.
Having survived the persecution of the Roman Emperor Domitian, Ignatius 
was martyred by the Emperor Trajan in AD 107 by being mauled by wild 
animals. The journey to Rome — and his death — took several months, and 
Ignatius used the time to write letters that early Christians used as words of 
encouragement. 

229
 Chapter 16: Greek Fathers of the Church
In his letter to the Romans, Ignatius wrote:
I am God’s wheat and shall be ground by the teeth of wild animals . . . Let 
me be food for the wild beasts, for they are my way to God. I am God’s 
wheat and shall be ground by their teeth so that I may become Christ’s pure 
bread. Pray to Christ for me that the animals will be the means of making 
me a sacrificial victim for God.
St. John Chrysostom of Constantinople 
Comana, Asia Minor (AD 347–AD 407)
Feast day: September 13
John’s eloquent preaching style earned him the name Chrysostom, which 
is Greek for “golden mouth.” He was ordained to the minor order of Lector 
(Reader), which enabled him to read the Sacred Scriptures aloud at Mass. 
Bishop Meletius saw promise in John and ordained him a deacon in AD 381; 
Bishop Flavian, who succeeded Bishop Meletius, ordained John a priest in AD 
386. John became renowned for the power and instruction in his sermons, 
and word of his spiritual wisdom got back to the emperor. 
Emperor Areadius wanted John to replace Bishop Nectarius of Constan-
tinople when he died in AD 397. John was the presumed replacement 
for Flavian at Antioch, but the imperial influence was such that even 
the Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria consented to John being sent to 
Constantinople. John was ordained bishop in February of AD 398.
John was a reformer of the human heart, seeking to eliminate scandal by 
removing temptation altogether, ordering clergy not to have vowed religious 
virgins living with them as housekeepers. He cut his own living expenses in 
half and ordered the monks to stay in their monasteries. 
Despite his friendships with Pope Innocent I and Emperor Honorius, John’s 
enemies in Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria made life a living hell 
for him. He was constantly persecuted and subjected to lies, slander, and 
attempts on his life. He was eventually exiled to Pythius but died on his way 
there.
 
John Chrysostom (see Figure 16-1) structured the Divine Liturgy (Mass) that’s 
still used today and is named in his honor. The Byzantine Catholic and Eastern 
Orthodox Churches sometimes use the Liturgy of St. Basil (also shown in 
Figure 16-1), but the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is more common.

St. John Damascene 
Jerusalem (AD 676–AD 749)
Feast day: December 3
John was also known as Chrysorrhoas (golden stream) and is considered 
the last Church Father, chronologically speaking. After Charlemagne was 
crowned Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day in the year AD 800 by Pope 
Leo III, the Middle Ages were fully under way, and the days of the Fathers of 
the Church, both East and West, were considered a closed chapter. 
John’s father, Mansur, was a wealthy financier who was allowed to remain a 
Christian and keep his wealth, which he used to buy the freedom of Christian 
slaves. 
Mansur hired a monk to tutor John in philosophy and theology — a job the 
monk did so well that John fell in love with both subjects. Devouring every-
thing he could read, John showed an almost unprecedented intellectual 
capacity. He applied his learning to defending the faith, especially against the 
heretical iconoclasts.
The iconoclasts saw images of God, the Virgin Mary, and the saints as idols, 
and they destroyed whatever they could get their hands on. John Damascene 
disproved and rebutted their arguments, creating some powerful enemies for 
himself. Some believe that Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople, schemed 
against him and forged a letter implying that John betrayed the caliph 

231

(Muslim secular ruler). The caliph then ordered John’s hand chopped off; 
when the Blessed Virgin Mary miraculously appeared and reattached John’s 
hand, the caliph’s trust in John was restored.
St. Justin Martyr 
Rome (AD 100–AD 164)
Feast day: June 1
Justin was a pagan philosopher who converted to Christianity at the age 
of 30. At first, he thought the wisdom of the Roman Stoics or the Greek 
Platonists would satisfy his intellectual hunger. He later realized that there 
was something beyond human knowledge, a divine wisdom, that could only 
be obtained by faith. As a Christian, he cherished divine revelation, not as 
something in competition with human philosophy but as an improvement 
and perfection of it.
 
Justin became a well-known defender of Christianity and showed the divine 
revelation for Gentiles to be compatible with that given the Jews in the Old 
Testament. 
Justin was killed during a trip to Rome. He went to establish a school of 
Christian philosophy but was confronted by pagan philosopher Crescens, 
who denounced him to Roman officials as a Christian. When Justin and six 
of his companions failed to worship the Romans’ pagan deities, they were 
tried and convicted. Justin was beheaded at the empire’s order. His writings 
survived, however, and they had a pronounced influence on winning more 
converts from Roman and Greek paganism over to Christianity.
St. Polycarp of Smyrna 
Smyrna (Turkey) (AD 69–AD 155)
Feast day: February 23
Polycarp was a disciple of the Apostle St. John the Evangelist and was a 
friend of St. Ignatius of Antioch. His letter to the Philippians, one of the few 
nonbiblical religious documents still intact, shows the existence and usage of 
New Testament literature during the beginning days of the ancient Christian 
Church.

232
Part IV: Explaining the Faith 
The Romans considered the Christians to be atheists because they refused to 
embrace the polytheist pagan religion of the empire. The hatred for Polycarp 
was intense, as he was seen as a leader of this countercultural sect. Wanting 
to feed him to the wild animals and watch him be torn to shreds, the mobs 
urged the Roman officials to kill Polycarp in a horrible manner. Polycarp’s 
enemies first attempted to burn him at the stake, but his body miraculously 
would not ignite. Angered, they then stabbed him to death (his blood put out 
the fire) and thus gave him a martyr’s death. Polycarp’s writings, verified by 
Irenaeus, give witness to the direct connection between the Apostles and the 
continuity of teaching and doctrine.

ere we look at potential saints in the pipeline — 
that is, those holy people already beatified and 
waiting for canonization. We examine saintly things like 
their earthly remains, especially relics, which are either 
bodily leftovers of the saints (their own bones, hair, or 
what have you) or things they wore or used (religious 
garb, religious items like a cross or crucifix, and so on).
We also take a look at various shrines — those places 
where the saints lived, worked, died, and are buried and 
that have since become memorials.

eneration of the saints isn’t idolatry, or false worship. According to the 
Christian faith, the Ten Commandments clearly condemn the worship of 
anyone or anything other than the Lord God.
Those same Ten Commandments also mandate that we honor our father and 
mother, but honoring someone isn’t the same as worshipping him. Honoring 
the saints isn’t any different. Erecting monuments and memorials to honor 
or remember people like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, or Winston 
Churchill isn’t considered idolatry, and neither is erecting similar monu-
ments to honor and remember St. Francis of Assisi or the Blessed Virgin 
Mary.
Christianity is centered on the doctrine that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
He is considered both human and divine, yet one person. This mystery of 
his dual nature (humanity and divinity) being united in his divine person-
hood is called the Incarnation. Because Jesus had a real human body, lived 
and walked on the earth, and visited actual places, the persons, places, and 
things associated with him have great importance and meaning to Christians.
In this chapter, we explore some of the shrines, relics, and pilgrimages that 
people of faith visit or undertake as part of their spiritual journey.

236
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Shrines
Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Calvary — Jesus’s birthplace, hometown, and site 
of death, respectively — are considered holy places. They also are home to 
shrines, particular locations in those towns at which the faithful can pray and 
meditate on the life of Christ.
Places where the holy saints lived, worked, and died are also revered as 
holy. Usually, the town where the saint died and is buried has a shrine, and 
in most cases, the actual body of the holy man or woman is there as well. St. 
Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first native-born American to be canonized, is buried 
at her national shrine in Emmitsburg, Maryland. St. John Neumann is buried 
at his shrine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Some shrines mark the location of an extraordinary event rather than the 
saint’s burial site. The shrine in Lourdes, France, for example, is where the 
Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Bernadette in 1858; a spring of miracu-
lous healing water has been there ever since. Thousands of pilgrims visit 
the shrine in Lourdes every year, some actually bathing in the waters of the 
grotto. St. Bernadette herself, however, is buried at the convent where she 
died in Nevers, France.
In this section, we look at popular shrines and shrines of popular saints. 
Some are in the place where the saint lived or is buried, while others are in 
local areas to make the pilgrimage more accessible to more people.
St. Maria Goretti Shrine
Located in Nettuno, just 37 miles (60 kilometers) south of Rome, this shrine 
honors one of Italy’s most popular saints. Maria Goretti was an 11-year-
old girl who forgave her attacker just before she died in 1902. Alessandro 
Serenelli (age 19) stabbed her 14 times when she resisted his attempts to 
seduce and then rape her. Pope Pius XII beatified her in 1947 and canonized 
her in 1950.
The shrine, built in 1969, contains her mortal remains where pilgrims make 
visits and offer prayers, especially for the safety of young girls and women 
and for the promotion of purity and chastity of all adolescents and young 
adults. The town of Nettuno is on the west coast of Italy between Rome and 
Naples, where many people vacation. The shrine also has a priceless, poly-
chromed, wooden statue of Our Lady of Grace, which the town honors with a 
procession every year on the first Saturday of May.

 Chapter 17: Saintly Shrines, Relics, and Pilgrimages
St. Anne-de-Beaupré Shrine
Located in Quebec, Canada, this shrine is dedicated to the mother of the 
Virgin Mary and therefore the maternal grandmother of Jesus Christ. French 
settlers built it in 1658. A second (1661) and a third (1676) church were built 
as the previous ones became too small and insufficient. The first basilica was 
begun in 1876 and was large enough to accommodate all the pilgrims from 
Canada and the U.S., but a fire completely destroyed it in 1922. One year 
later, the present basilica was built at the current location.
Neo-Romanesque in architecture, the shrine to St. Anne receives hundreds 
of thousands of pilgrims each year. French- and English-speaking Canadians, 
U.S. citizens, and Europeans alike visit this holy memorial to the mother of 
the Mother of God. Often called the Lourdes of North America, St. Anne’s 
shrine gets thousands of visitors who are sick and infirm.
St. Jean-Marie Vianney Shrine
Located in Ars, France, the shrine to St. John Vianney (called Sanctuaire 
d’Ars in French) is dedicated to the patron saint of all priests throughout the 
world. The shrine is part of the diocese of Belley-Ars, of the ecclesiastical 
province of Lyon, France. It’s a diocesan church, unlike many shrines, which 
are owned and operated by a religious community of men or women.
The church of St. Sixtus, a 12th-century monument, rebuilt by the efforts of 
St. John (Jean) Vianney, is now a gateway into the 19th-century St. Sixtus 
Basilica, which the priest had commissioned by the architect Pierre-Marie 
Bossan. The transept of the basilica contains a reliquary containing the incor-
rupt body of the holy pastor of Ars. An underground church was built in 1961 
to handle the overflow number of pilgrims.
St. (Padre) Pio of Pietrelcina Shrine
Although Padre Pio was born in the town of Pietrelcina, he died and is buried 
in San Giovanni Rotondo (province of Foggia) in southern Italy, where his 
remains are entombed at the shrine in his honor. A church (San Maria delle 
Grazie) was built in 1950 because the original friary where St. Pio celebrated 
daily Mass was becoming too crowded. That became the shrine when he died 
in 1968. A new shrine was built in 2004 that can accommodate 6,500 people. 
It’s run by the Capuchin Franciscans, the religious order to which Padre Pio 
belonged.

238
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Pilgrims can visit the shrine museum in San Giovanni Rotondo, which con-
tains the vestments the saint wore when he celebrated Mass, his religious 
habit, personal artifacts, and the famous gloves he wore in humility to hide 
the stigmata. The stigmata are a supernatural appearance of one or more of 
the five wounds of Christ on a person. Padre Pio would get the wounds in his 
hands and bleed every time he celebrated Holy Mass. He eventually wore the 
gloves to prevent people from being distracted from the divine worship.
Near the shrine of Padre Pio is the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza (House to 
Relieve Suffering), which is the hospital the saint founded through donations 
of patrons. No fee or charge is assessed to any patient who comes to this 
medical treatment center. Built in 1956, it has state-of-the-art technology and 
is one of the most hygienic hospitals in Europe.
St. (Mother) Francis Xavier Cabrini
Located in northern Manhattan in New York City, less than a mile from the 
George Washington Bridge, the Mother Cabrini Shrine overlooks the Hudson 
River and the state of New Jersey. The 19th-century Italian immigrant from 
Lombardy came to America to help those who were being neglected in 
the New World because of prejudice toward Catholics and Italians alike. 
She founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and built 
schools and orphanages in Chicago, Illinois; Golden, Colorado; New Orleans, 
Louisiana; Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington, in addition to 
the one in New York.
When Mother Cabrini was beatified in 1938, her remains were placed in a 
glass-enclosed coffin to rest beneath the altar at the shrine. Pope Pius XII 
canonized her in 1946, and in 1957, a new shrine of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini 
was begun and completed in 1960. Mother Cabrini’s earthly remains are now 
kept in an urn and were transferred to the new shrine. A wax effigy of her 
is displayed in the altar for veneration. Surrounding the altar are mosaics 
depicting her life, and a two-story stained glass window of her is at the west 
entrance. The shrine is part of the nearby parish of St. Elizabeth Church, at 
187th Street and Wadsworth Avenue.
Many pilgrims of Italian descent visit her shrine in appreciation for the love 
and work she gave to the Church and her fellow paesans (“countrymen” in 
Italian).

239
 Chapter 17: Saintly Shrines, Relics, and Pilgrimages
St. Faustina Shrine
Located in Kraków, Poland, the shrine to St. Faustina Kowalska was built 
on the same grounds of the convent of the Congregation of Sisters of Our 
Lady of Mercy. That’s the religious community Sister Faustina entered as a 
nun. She had a vision of Jesus in 1931 where he appeared with white and red 
rays emanating from his Sacred Heart. The white represented the grace of 
Baptism (because water is used) and the red represented the grace of the 
Holy Eucharist (because of the precious blood). Both come from the same 
source, both wash away sin, and both are sources of divine mercy.
Pilgrims from around the world come to visit this shrine. It was painted by 
the artist Adolf Hyła, who presented it to the convent chapel in Kraków-
Łagiewniki as a votive offering for the miraculous saving of his family from 
the war. Every year on the Feast of Divine Mercy (first Sunday after Easter), 
large numbers of pilgrims come to the shrine to honor the request made by 
Jesus to St. Faustina to pray for mercy, especially for the conversion of 
sinners.
Relics
Things or artifacts that once belonged to the saints are also considered holy 
and are called relics. Relics are separated into three categories — first-class, 
second-class, and third-class.
Almost every Catholic church has some relics of the saints. These things 
have special meaning for those who honor and venerate the memory of their 
original owner.
 
Just as there is nothing magical about the holy places where shrines are 
erected, neither is there anything magical about relics. They don’t bring you 
good luck or protect you from harm, but they are mementos of these spiritual 
heroes. St. Jerome stated, “We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that 
we should bow down to the creature rather than to the Creator, but we vener-
ate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore him whose martyrs 
they are.”
Canon law forbids the sale of relics in any shape or form. During the Middle 
Ages, a few unscrupulous and wicked men sought to take advantage of the 
growing popularity of relics, so they took animal bones and promoted them 
as first-class relics of popular saints. Not only were these relics fakes, but the 
men were also trafficking in what was claimed to be authentic relics, which 
would have been a sin in itself.

240
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Today, strict rules of documentation must accompany any relic of any class. 
Without the paperwork, these items can’t be displayed for public veneration. 
Only one or two places in Rome now provide relics for Catholic churches 
around the world, to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the relic and 
prevent any fraud or abuse.
The following sections discuss each of these classes of relics.
First-class relics
 
First-class relics are any part of the saint’s body. While hair would be consid-
ered a relic, most often a first-class relic is a piece of bone that’s contained in 
a reliquary (a special container for displaying relics of the saints).
These small fragments are contained in either elaborate reliquaries or placed 
inside altar stones — a square piece of marble with a small hole containing 
the first-class relics of one or more saints, which is laid into the top of an 
altar.
When the Romans persecuted the Christians for the first 300 years after 
Christ’s birth, Mass was celebrated secretly in the catacombs and usually 
over the graves of the holy martyrs. After Christianity was legalized, the prac-
tice of celebrating Mass over the relics of martyrs was maintained by placing 
a relic inside the altar to be used for Mass.
While most first-class relics are bones, there are others. For example:
 
✓ A relic of St. Anthony’s incorrupt (non-decayed) tongue is in a reliquary 
at his shrine in Padua, Portugal.
 
✓ A vial of St. Januarius’s blood is at his shrine in Naples, Italy, and the 
faithful come every year on his feast day (September 19) to witness the 
annual de-coagulation of his blood.
 
✓ The right forearm of St. Stephen of Hungary is in a reliquary at his shrine 
in Budapest.
Second-class relics
 
Second-class relics are things the saint personally owned, wore, or used. 
Clothing, writing instruments, and personal items such as a private Bible, 
Rosary, crucifix, ring, or religious garb, for example, are the usual things clas-
sified as second-class relics.

241
 Chapter 17: Saintly Shrines, Relics, and Pilgrimages
The gloves worn by St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina are considered second-class 
relics, as they touched his body but weren’t part of it. The eyeglasses worn 
by St. Elizabeth Ann Seton would be a second-class relic, but usually some-
thing of that size and caliber are kept in a religious museum. Pieces of the 
religious habit that a saint wore, or the person’s vestments (if the saint was a 
cleric), would be more available to the common folk.
The size is inconsequential, so even a small fragment or swatch of material 
is all that’s needed. Often, the relic itself is so small as to make it unrecogniz-
able, but the paperwork of authenticity that accompanies every legitimate 
relic tells you what it is.
Third-class relics
 
Third-class relics are usually pieces of cloth that are touched to a first- or 
second-class relic. These are the most common because they don’t involve 
the distribution or disintegration of a first- or second-class relic.
Often, you can find third-class relics attached to a holy card made soon after 
the canonization of a saint. The piece of cloth is usually no larger than 1⁄8 inch. 
The relic is inserted into a holy card with a prayer inscribed that’s addressed 
to the saint for intercession before God.
Pilgrimages
Sometimes, there’s more to a holy visit than the destination; often, the jour-
ney itself is worthy of note and reflection. This journey, called a pilgrimage, 
is the trip one takes from a home location to a spiritual destination, and the 
travel is part of the symbolism. Just as the Hebrews journeyed for 40 years 
in the desert before reaching the Promised Land after their Exodus from 
Egyptian slavery, Christians have for centuries made pilgrimages to the 
places where Jesus lived, walked, performed miracles, died, and was 
resurrected.
Hebrews, in fact, made pilgrimages every year to the Temple in Jerusalem 
before it was destroyed in AD 70. The last remnant of that is the Wailing 
Wall, where Jewish pilgrims continue to visit two millennia later. Muslims are 
encouraged to make at least one pilgrimage (called the Hajj) to Mecca in their 
lifetime. Likewise, Catholic Christians are exhorted to visit those places con-
sidered holy by their religion.

242
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Pilgrimages were never meant to be easy, cheap, or comfortable. People 
go on pilgrimages less frequently than pleasure trips but do so with great 
devotion and prayer. Often, people go on pilgrimages in groups rather than 
individually. Traveling with others isn’t always fun; some people don’t like 
to fly, or they get seasick or carsick, for instance. Putting up with your fellow 
pilgrims is part of the process. The spiritual nature of the journey and the 
destination, however, gives pilgrims the motivation to endure more and put 
up with more inconvenience and even occasional hardship.
 
Every inconvenience and unexpected problem is seen as a spiritual challenge 
when on pilgrimage. These snags are meant to toughen up the traveler and 
be used as penance for past sins or mortification to be stronger in resisting 
future temptations. That’s why first-class accommodations aren’t promoted: 
The purpose of the pilgrimage is to symbolize the real-life pilgrimage when a 
believer travels from this world into the next.
The following sections discuss some of the earliest pilgrimages, as well as 
more modern-day ones.
The early pilgrimages
The first Christian pilgrimages didn’t take place until the fourth century 
because of 300 years of Roman persecution. After the Emperor Constantine 
issued the Edict of Milan in AD 313 officially legalizing Christianity, the faith-
ful could openly practice their religion. His mother, Empress St. Helena, 
made the first public pilgrimage to the Holy Land and went to Jerusalem to 
find the place where Jesus died on the cross. A church was built on the site, 
beginning the practice of an active church being located where a holy person 
lived, worked, and/or died.
Though the Romans built many roads and aqueducts throughout the empire, 
the popularity of pilgrimages during the Middle Ages prompted the building 
of more roads to help the travelers get to their destination. Hospitals, hos-
tels, and inns were needed along the difficult routes to take care of the basic 
material needs (food, medicine, shelter) of the many pilgrims journeying 
throughout Europe. As the Crusades tried to free up the pilgrimage sites in 
the Holy Land, more local places were sought by those not “with sword,” as 
they were called. Hence, the faithful journeyed to shrines in France, Germany, 
Italy, Portugal, Spain, and other lands. Though not places where Jesus actu-
ally walked, these shrines marked places where the saints had lived and/
or died and were often buried: Santiago de Compostela, Czestochowa, 
Walsingham, Fulda, Aachen, Mariazell, Monte Sant’Angelo, Rome, and so on.

243
 Chapter 17: Saintly Shrines, Relics, and Pilgrimages
American pilgrimages
Thousands of Americans make pilgrimages to the Basilica of the National 
Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. Dedicated to the 
Virgin Mary, this shrine has within it many mini-shrines to the saints and to 
Mary and her apparitions, such as in Lourdes, Fatima, Knock, and Guadalupe.
Many Catholic dioceses across the U.S. have pilgrimages to the National 
Shrine to mark anniversaries, like the founding of the diocese, or to celebrate 
a holy year in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as the diocese of Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania, did in October 2009. Parish pilgrimages also take place, where 
the pastor, parochial vicar, and deacon lead a group from their congregation 
to the shrine. Mass is celebrated in one of the many smaller chapels, and 
visits to the gift shop and bookstore are always popular afterwards.
 
When you can’t afford to travel overseas, try making a local pilgrimage. 
Besides the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, this 
side of the Atlantic has many other national shrines, including
 
✓ Any of the 21 missions in California
 
✓ Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Ann in Scranton, Pennsylvania
 
✓ Blue Army Shrine in Washington, New Jersey
 
✓ Mother Cabrini Shrine in Golden, Colorado
 
✓ National Shrine of North American Martyrs in Auriesville, New York
 
✓ National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa in Doylestown, 
Pennsylvania
 
✓ National Shrine of St. Gerard in Newark, New Jersey
 
✓ Shrine of Divine Mercy in Stockton, Massachusetts
 
✓ Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows in Belleville, Illinois
 
✓ Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in Emmitsburg, Maryland
 
✓ Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville, Alabama
 
✓ Shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin

Part V: Living with the Saints 
A pilgrimage for priests
Pope Benedict declared June 19, 2009, to June 19, 2010, as the “Year for 
Priests.” Consequently, many priests, deacons, and lay faithful have made or 
are making pilgrimages to the shrine of St. John Vianney, the patron saint of 
all priests. He worked and died in Ars, France, where there’s a shrine to this 
holy man of God (see the “St. Jean-Marie Vianney Shrine” section earlier in 
the chapter). Making a pilgrimage to his shrine is similar to the journey that 
thousands made in 2008 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Virgin 
Mary appearing to St. Bernadette in Lourdes, France.

A
s we discuss in Chapter 1, before one is formally canonized a saint, he 
or she is first named a servant of God. After one proven miracle (post-
mortem), the person is beatified and called blessed. If a second miracle can be 
established, the pope can declare the person an official saint of the Church, 
who is venerated as being with the Lord in heaven.
 
Not everyone who is beatified is automatically canonized; that is, not all 
blesseds become saints. Only those beatified men and women whose inter-
cession can be proven by an additional indisputable miracle are eligible for 
canonization (sainthood). In this chapter, we introduce you to some notable 
beatified persons whose causes for canonization are moving along as more 
evidence is discovered.
Blessed Francisco and Blessed Jacinta
Fatima, Portugal (1909–1919 [Francisco]; 1910–1920 [Jacinta])
Beatified: 2000
Feast day: February 20
Francisco and Jacinta Marto, along with their cousin Lucia Santos, would 
have been ordinary children in the obscure town of Fatima, Portugal, were it 
not for six monthly visits from the Mother of God.

246
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Francisco and Jacinta, ages 8 and 7, respectively, accompanied Lucia, age 10, 
as she tended sheep on May 13, 1917. On that day, the three experienced the 
first of six apparitions of the Virgin Mary; the other five occurred on the 13th 
day of each of the ensuing months.
The children received three prophecies from the Virgin Mary, as well as 
a vision of hell, where damned souls endure eternal punishment for their 
unrepentant sins. The Virgin Mary warned the children in the first prophecy 
of the spread of Communism and its attendant abandonment of faith, six 
months before the Russian Revolution deposed Tsar Nicholas II. The second 
prophecy was of another and deadlier war to follow World War I if people 
didn’t stop offending God by engaging in sinful behavior. Finally, the Virgin 
Mary presented in the third prophecy a vision of a bishop “dressed in white” 
(an allusion to the Bishop of Rome, the pope, who wears white) who would 
be attacked and shot. (Pope John Paul II was shot by would-be assassin 
Mehmet Ali Aca on May 13, 1981.)
The deep faith of the children following the apparitions was apparent in 
ways as different as the children themselves. Francisco, a quiet boy, pre-
ferred to pray alone, while Jacinta became deeply convinced that suffering 
through penance and sacrifice was the best way to save sinners. She believed 
so deeply, in fact, that while lying in a hospital bed dying of influenza, she 
refused to be anesthetized for surgery. Her pain, she believed, would help 
convert sinners.
Miracle of the sun
After the first apparition on May 13, word spread and crowds grew month 
after month, despite attempts by the local government to discourage such 
activity. On the morning of the Virgin Mary’s final visit (October 13, 1917), 
more than 70,000 bystanders came to see what was bringing the children 
each month to a seemingly abandoned place.
Shortly after noon, the sun appeared in the sky after being obscured by 
clouds all morning. It then looked like a disc, dancing and spinning in the 
The Fatima pope
Because the attempted assassination in 1981 of 
Pope John Paul II occurred on the anniversary 
of the first apparition of Fatima, he attributed his 
survival to the prayers of the Virgin Mary. He 
subsequently visited Fatima and had the bullet 
that nearly killed him encased inside the crown 
that adorns a statue of Our Lady of Fatima, 
which resides to this day at the Basilica Shrine 
in Fatima, Portugal.

heavens, ebbing and growing as if the earth had been plunged toward the 
sun. People were able to look directly at the sight without any harm or irrita-
tion to their eyes. Despite standing in a torrential downpour before the event, 
everyone’s clothing was dry when it ended.
Francisco and Jacinta were both victims of the influenza epidemic that swept 
through Europe in 1918. Francisco died peacefully at home in 1919, and less 
than a year later, after countless trips to the hospital, Jacinta died alone in a 
hospital room. Their cousin, Lucia, became a Carmelite nun and died in 2005.
A 69-year-old Portuguese woman, Maria Emilia Santos, was totally paralyzed 
for 22 years until February 20, 1989, when she had an instant and complete 
cure through the intercession of Francisco and Jacinta. This was the first 
miracle needed to beatify the two children.
The process for canonization for the siblings began in 1945, and their case 
was officially opened in 1952. They were declared venerable in 1989, and 
Pope John Paul II beatified Francisco and Jacinta on May 13, 2000, 83 years to 
the day after the first visit from the Virgin Mary.
In 2005, just a week after Sister Lucia Santos died, the canonization petition 
for Francisco and Jacinta was sent to the cardinal prefect of the Congregation 
for Sainthood Causes. The final decision is up to the pope.
In February 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced he would waive the five-
year waiting period and that the beatification process for Sister Lucia Santos 
could begin.
What canonization will mean
Because they were brother and sister, canonizing Jacinta and Francisco will 
have a great impact on family life in general and in each individual family as 
well. It will encourage siblings to work together and to pray together. Not 
only will Catholics and all Portuguese citizens be proud of these two holy 
children (three, if and when Lucia is canonized), but families and children 
around the world will find an example and beacon of hope to live as real chil-
dren of God.
Pope Blessed John XXIII
Sotto il Monte, Italy (1881–1963)
Beatified: 2000
Feast day: October 11 (opening day of Vatican II in 1962)

248
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Often called the “smiling pope” or “good Pope John” because of his conge-
nial manner and constant smile, Pope John XXIII was known for his desire 
to extend an olive branch of peace to promote ecumenical dialogue. His 
work wasn’t an attempt to dilute Catholic teaching or alter Catholic worship; 
rather, he sincerely wanted to build bridges among all the Christian churches 
and other religions to work together for the peace of mankind.
Life of service
Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was born on November 25, 1881, in Sotto il Monte, 
near Bergamo, in northern Italy. He was the firstborn son of peasant parents 
and 4th in a family of 14. Financially poor but spiritually rich, Angelo had a 
burning desire to study for the priesthood and was supported financially by 
an uncle.
The discovery of his own intellectual and cultural awkwardness in compari-
son to that of his seminary classmates sowed the seeds for Christian humil-
ity, which became his hallmark in life.
After his ordination as a priest in 1904, Angelo served as secretary to his 
bishop, Giacomo Maria Radini-Tedeschi, and taught in the seminary of the 
Diocese of Bergamo until the outbreak of World War I. He was drafted into 
the Italian Army Medical Corps and served as a stretcher-bearer.
After the war ended, Angelo returned to his diocese until 1921, when Pope 
Benedict XV named him Italy’s director of the Society for the Propagation of 
the Faith, the official organization that promotes evangelization and provides 
for the social welfare of the sick, the injured, the unemployed, and the home-
less. Angelo was so successful in restructuring the old organization to meet 
the needs of the postwar world that Pope Pius XI promoted him to bishop in 
1925. He joined the Vatican Diplomatic Corps, and his first assignment was as 
Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria.
In 1935, he was named Apostolic Delegate to Greece and Turkey. In 1944, at 
the height of World War II, he became Apostolic Nuncio to France for Pope 
Pius XII. He worked with a German ambassador and saved the lives of more 
than 24,000 European Jews who were condemned to a horrible death in 
the Nazi concentration camps. For this, many survivors in Israel consider 
Roncalli a Righteous Gentile. (Only those non-Jews who worked to help the 
persecuted escape imprisonment or death, especially during World War II,

Following the end of the war in 1945, Bishop Roncalli hoped to return to 
some quiet obscurity, but Pope Pius XII elevated him to cardinal and made 
him Patriarch of Venice in 1953. This enabled him to participate in the papal 
conclave of 1958 after the death of Pius. After four days of balloting, the elec-
tors chose him to succeed Pius XII.

 Chapter 18: Waiting for Their Halos: Saints in the Pipeline
The new pope chose John XXIII as his papal name. Just shy of his 77th birth-
day, John XXIII was considered a “transition” pope, expected to serve for a 
short time. He surprised everyone when he announced three months after 
his coronation that he intended to convene an Ecumenical Council (see the 
nearby sidebar on Vatican II).
 
Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, initiated the long-needed 
revision of the 1917 Code of Canon Law (which would finally be completed 
by John Paul II in 1983), and convened a diocesan Synod for the Diocese of 
Rome, all before his death on June 3, 1963. His aim was to open the windows 
of the Vatican and let in some fresh air, as he called it. Though he staunchly 
defended all defined dogmas and doctrines and was faithful to authentic dis-
cipline (priestly celibacy), John XXIII wanted the Catholic Church to be part 
of — and not necessarily contend with — the modern world, as long as the 
revealed laws of God weren’t compromised.
Vatican II
The Second Vatican Council, commonly known 
as Vatican II, was the 21st such meeting of bish-
ops in the Catholic Church. The first took place 
in Nicea, AD 325, and the most recent (before 
Vatican II) was held in the Vatican (called 
Vatican I) in 1869–1870.
Pope John XXIII opened Vatican II in October 
1962; Pope Paul VI concluded the Council in 
December 1965. The Council issued 16 docu-
ments that have become blueprints for teach-
ing, explaining, and living the Catholic faith 
in the modern era. None of these documents 
issued any new dogmas or defined any new 
doctrines. None changed, amended, or dis-
solved any previously defined teachings or tra-
ditions. Some would say that the modifications 
of Vatican II were simply cosmetic, adapting 
what was adaptable while preserving what was 
substantial and necessary.
The most influential innovations of the Second 
Vatican Council were the changes made to the 
Sacred Liturgy. While the essentials remained 
unchanged, the vernacular language was given 
more prominence (whereas Latin had been the 
norm for more than 15 centuries). Byzantine and 
Eastern Catholic Rites were encouraged to go 
back to their original customs, especially in the 
Sacraments.
Contrary to popular belief, Latin was never 
abolished and was in fact meant to remain in 
common parts of the Mass (although some used 
Vatican II to eliminate any or most traditional 
piety from Catholic worship). The bishops had 
no intention of altering moral law; claims that 
contraception and abortion were up for discus-
sion at Vatican II are simply false. Neither were 
any defined dogmas in jeopardy. The divinity 
of Christ, the virginity of Mary, the inerrancy of 
Scripture, the infallibility of the pope, and the 
indefectibility of the Church were never dis-
puted at Vatican II.

Part V: Living with the Saints 
In 1966, Sister Caterina Capitani (Daughter of Charity from Sicily) suffered 
from a tumor, severe gastric bleeding, and infection. Other nuns put an image 
of John XXIII on her stomach. The nun immediately rose from her bed and 
began eating. Her total and complete miraculous cure was used to promote 
the beatification of John XXIII.
Pope John XXIII was beatified by Pope John Paul II on September 3, 2000, 
before a huge crowd. His papal encyclicals (authoritative letters from a 
pope explaining the teachings of the Church as applied to modern times), 
“Pacem in Terris” (Latin for “Peace on Earth”) and “Mater et Magistra” (Latin 
for “Mother and Teacher”), are still revered for their profound insight into 
Catholic social teaching on justice and morality. The first document dealt 
with a nonmilitary and nonconfrontational approach to resolving disputes 
among nations, employing realistic diplomacy whenever possible. It also 
strongly promoted international recognition and defense of human rights for 
all human beings, regardless of nationality. The second document concerned 
the moral responsibility of the state (secular government) to provide help for 
basic human needs (food, shelter, employment, and education) for citizens 
who are unable to secure these for themselves. While not advocating a social-
ist type of government (Pope John XXIII remained politically neutral), John 
XXIII did underscore the moral imperative for all people to help each other, 
not just individually but communally as well. He defended the intrinsic right 
of ownership of private property and repudiated forced nationalization of 
business while advocating social responsibility to care for the poor and 
disadvantaged.
What canonization will mean
Canonizing a modern pope will encourage the faithful that even their leaders 
can and ought to seek holiness — saintly pastors have saintly parishioners 
and vice versa. It would also dispel the urban legend that only monks and 
nuns can become Saints. John XXIII is considered the Father of the Second 
Vatican Council, so his canonization would be seen by some as a vindication 
of Vatican II across the board.
Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha
Ossernenon, New York (1656–1680)
Beatified: 1980
Feast day: July 14 (USA); April 17 (Canada)

251
 Chapter 18: Waiting for Their Halos: Saints in the Pipeline
Kateri Tekakwitha was a young Native American woman who followed her 
devout faith despite knowing she would become estranged from her family 
and friends.
Following her faith
Kateri was born in 1656 in a village called Ossernenon, near Aurielsville, New 
York, the daughter of a Mohawk warrior chief and a Christian Algonquin 
who had been captured by the Iroquois. Kateri’s parents and her brother 
died from a smallpox epidemic when she was only 4 years old; though she 
survived, her eyesight was impaired and her face slightly disfigured from the 
disease.
A turning point came in 1667, when Kateri met some French Jesuit missionar-
ies who preached to her about Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church. It took 
her nine years, however, to ask for Baptism, because she knew she would 
incur the disapproval — and even wrath — of many of her tribe.
Eventually, Kateri left her village, as they refused to accept her conversion 
to Christianity. She ended up in Caughnawaga on the St. Lawrence River, 
where some Christian Native Americans found a refuge and home. There, she 
cared for the sick and elderly of the village and spent time in prayer before 
the Blessed Sacrament in the Tabernacle (the large metal container, often 
fashioned to look like the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant, that contains the 
consecrated hosts of bread that Catholics believe have become the Body of 
Christ).
Kateri died at the age of 24 on April 17, 1680. Her devout faith inspired many 
Native Americans to embrace Christianity and Catholicism. She was declared 
venerable by the Catholic Church in 1943 and beatified in 1980. Paul Vezina, a 
32-year-old Canadian, was miraculously healed of pulmonary tuberculosis in 
1939 after praying a novena (nine-day prayer) to Kateri Tekakwitha. This was 
the needed miracle for her beatification.
What canonization will mean
Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha is the first Native American to be beatified and 
would be the first to be canonized, as well. She has therefore been declared 
the patroness for all Native Americans.
Canonizing Kateri Tekakwitha will be a huge source of pride and joy for 
Native Americans and for all women, too. Having a Native American saint will 

252
Part V: Living with the Saints 
help evangelization (spreading the faith) and sustain those already baptized 
and confirmed as Catholic Christians who have similar ancestry as Kateri. 
Sadly, there were instances where Native Americans were physically forced 
to convert and abandon their natural religions, but they weren’t the majority, 
and many more like Kateri freely, willingly, and happily embraced Catholic 
Christianity. While not abandoning all her traditions and heritage, canonizing 
a Native American like her will show that Christianity is compatible with the 
Native American people and that those who accept it do so because they see 
it as a natural completion and fulfillment of the faith given them by their fore-
fathers and foremothers.
Blessed Marie Rose Durocher
Quebec, Canada (1811–1849)
Beatified: 1982
Feast day: October 6
Sister Marie Rose Durocher’s life was dedicated to caring for the poor and 
the sick and to educating young children. She created the Sisters of the Holy 
Names of Jesus and Mary just two years after a government action estab-
lished legal protection for Catholics in Canada.
A life of work, sacrifice, and love
Eulalie Durocher was born on October 6, 1811, at St. Antoine in Quebec, 
Canada, the 10th of 11 children. When Eulalie turned 16, like most girls her 
age, she fell in love, but not with any earthly boy. She fell in love with Christ 
and desperately wanted to become a Bride of Christ (the metaphorical term 
for religious sisters and nuns) by entering the convent. Her poor health ini-
tially kept her from being admitted into the religious order.
In 1931, two years after her mother died, she and her father moved in with 
her brother, Theophile, a priest. She became his housekeeper and cook. 
Bishop Ignace Bourget asked Eulalie to form a religious community of women 
in 1843. She took the name Marie Rose and called the group the Sisters of the 
Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.
Sister Marie Rose, along with companions Mélodie Dufresne and Henriette 
Céré, dedicated herself to the teaching and welfare of children. Despite poor 
health, she wasn’t averse to hard work and often labored long into the night, 
only getting minimal sleep. Still, she saw her work as a labor of love and did 

253
 Chapter 18: Waiting for Their Halos: Saints in the Pipeline
everything joyfully and enthusiastically. Personal comfort and convenience 
were alien concepts to Marie Rose Durocher, while Christian charity and 
patience were her life mottos. Her legacy was a life dedicated and devoted to 
serving the poor and the sick and educating children.
What canonization will mean
Declaring Marie Rose Durocher a saint will be an important milestone for 
Catholic Canadians and for religious women as well. Europe has had the 
most saints, only because the Church has been there for two millennia. 
Catholicism wasn’t brought to the New World of North and South America 
until 15 centuries after the time of Christ. So countries like Canada, Mexico, 
and the U.S. are much younger than their elder European brethren. Having 
homegrown saints inspires a nation and encourages vocations to serve the 
Church.
Marie Rose’s canonization will boost Canadian pride and bear witness to the 
personal piety and shared faith of millions of citizens who practice the same 
religion as this holy woman. St. Marie Rose would also inspire other women 
to be pioneers in working for the Church and serving the poor.
Blessed Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez, S.J.
Zacatecas, Mexico (1891–1988)
Beatified: 1988
Feast day: November 23
Father Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez spent his life caring for abused and 
exploited workers, despite his own illness, and boldly shared his faith at a 
time when his native Mexico banned the exhibition of religious garb and the 
government persecuted the Catholic Church.
Fighting persecution
Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez was born January 13, 1891, at Zacatecas, Mexico, 
the son of a mining engineer. The 3rd of 11 children, Miguel entered the 
Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1911. He was soon exiled because of the 
Mexican Revolution and traveled to the U.S., Spain, Nicaragua, and Belgium, 
where he was ordained in 1925.

254
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Father Miguel suffered from stomach ulcers but remained vigilant in his 
mission to work among his own people in Mexico, especially among the 
mineworkers who were being brutally exploited and abused. By the time 
he returned to his homeland, the new Mexican constitution had banned 
all Catholic schools and the wearing of any religious garb whatsoever. The 
Church was violently persecuted, and many priests, bishops, and nuns were 
deported, arrested, tortured, and killed as a result of the government’s pro-
motion of virulent anti-Catholicism.
Father Miguel was arrested and charged with a failed assassination attempt 
on the president; his only true crime was clandestinely celebrating Mass 
for his people. Politicians made him a scapegoat, however, and he was con-
demned to death by firing squad on November 23, 1927. As he stood before 
the firing squad, he held his Rosary and crucifix and declared, “Viva Cristo 
Rey” (“Long live Christ the King”).
Pope John Paul II beatified Miguel Pro on September 25, 1988, in an open-air 
public Mass before thousands in Mexico — which, ironically, was still an ille-
gal activity even six decades after Miguel’s death.
What canonization will mean
Canonizing Miguel Pro will be an enormous shot in the arm to the Catholic 
Church in Mexico, as he was one of the most beloved martyrs to die for 
the faith at the hands of an aggressively antireligious government. Despite 
improvements in church-state relations, Mexico still evinces a noticeable ten-
sion and residual anticlericalism. Recognizing a national and religious hero 
will be of mutual benefit, because many laity also fought an unjust adminis-
tration for the sake of the common good of all Mexicans.
Blessed Teresa of Calcutta (Also 
Known As Mother Teresa)
Macedonia (1910–1997)
Beatified: 2003
Feast day: September 5
Mother Teresa worked among the poorest of the poor — lepers and untouch-
ables, those very often shunned in Hindu culture. Literally picking these 
abandoned men, women, and children from the gutters and ghettos of 

255
 Chapter 18: Waiting for Their Halos: Saints in the Pipeline
Calcutta, India, this little nun and her companions rescued many from an 
ignoble death.
A life of empathy
Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in 
Macedonia. Her father died when she was 8, and her mother supported the 
family with her embroidery. When she was 18, Agnes joined the Sisters of 
Loreto convent (formally called the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary) in 
Dublin. There she took the name of her beloved heroine, Saint Thérèse of 
Lisieux (also known as St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus). In 1929, Sister Mary 
Teresa (this was her complete and formal religious name) was sent to teach 
at St. Mary’s School for Girls, Loreto, in Calcutta. After she took her final 
solemn profession of vows (poverty, chastity, and obedience), committing 
herself to this life in 1937, she became known as Mother Teresa to her sisters 
and eventually to the world.
While riding the train from Calcutta to Darjeeling on September 10, 1946, for 
her annual retreat, Mother Teresa felt a “call within a call.” She described it 
as an awareness of the presence of God and a deep conviction that the Lord 
was calling her to branch out of her current apostolate. She was made aware 
of the thirst that Jesus had for the poorest of the poor, for in their suffering, 
he, too, shared their pain and misery.
After two years of prayer and discernment, Mother Teresa got ecclesiastical 
permission to establish her own religious community, the Missionaries of 
Charity. Over time, the Missionaries of Charity would grow into a community 
of 4,000 sisters in 123 countries around the world.
Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. She addressed 
the United Nations in 1985 and that same year opened the first house to care 
for AIDS patients in New York City. She was given honorary U.S. citizenship 
in 1991 and the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal just a few months before her 
death on September 5, 1997.
 
Normally, no one can be considered for beatification (and, their supporters 
hope, eventual sainthood) until five years after death. This waiting period 
provides time for emotions to return to normal so the process can be guided 
not by sentimentality but by facts. In the case of Mother Teresa, though, Pope 
John Paul II allowed the process to begin in 1999 because a verified miracle 
had occurred soon after Mother Teresa’s death. A 30-year-old Indian woman, 
Monica Besra, was apparently cured of stomach cancer after praying to 
Mother Teresa.

256
Part V: Living with the Saints 
Pope John Paul II officially beatified Mother Teresa on October 19, 2003, with 
more than 300,000 pilgrims in attendance at St. Peter’s Square, Rome.
What canonization will mean
Mother Teresa’s canonization as a saint will have great influence not only to 
promote work for the poor but also for perseverance in times of adversity. 
Despite opposition and suspicion, she held her ground and kept doing what 
she knew she had to do. Even recent disclosures of her “dark night of the 
soul” reveal a very human phenomenon. Many people of faith feel abandoned 
at some time, even though they know that the Lord is always there. But feel-
ing this way doesn’t indicate lack or weakness of faith. Faith is an act of the 
intellect where one assents to the existence and presence of God. You can 
believe in God and not always feel his affection. Theologians say this is to 
entice us to want heaven all the more, where there is both knowledge of God 
and the enjoyment of his love. Anyone who has ever felt dryness in his spiri-
tual life will be encouraged to know that Mother Teresa went down that same 
road. Her canonization as a saint will prove that this is not an impediment 
but merely a necessary trial to achieve holiness.

Ten Favorite Litanies of the Saints
In This Chapter
▶ A litany for all the saints
▶ Popular litanies for specific saints
L
itanies are invocations that one makes to a saint asking for spiritual 
intercession before Jesus. This chapter introduces some of the favorite 
litanies people use in seeking intercession.
 
Catholicism firmly believes that only one mediator lies between God and man: 
Jesus Christ. An intercessor, on the other hand, merely asks a favor for some-
one else. Each litany, whether recited, chanted, or sung, begins with an 
address to the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).
Litany of the Saints
The most ancient litany of the Church is one directed to all the saints. It’s 
used every year at the Easter vigil, the night before Easter Sunday, when 
Baptisms are celebrated. It’s also used during the Sacrament of Holy Orders, 
when a man is ordained a deacon, priest, or bishop.
The traditional litany follows, with the congregation’s responses in italics. 
Brackets indicate saints who’ve been added to the traditional litany.

St. Dominic is a popular saint of the 13th century. He’s famous for spreading 
devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary via the Rosary (prayer beads). Although 
the religious community he founded is called the Order of Preachers, the

Ten Famous Novenas to the Saints
In This Chapter
▶ Novenas to the Virgin Mary
▶ Novenas to various other saints
A
novena is a nine-day prayer. Christians began the practice of nine days 
of prayer at the time of Jesus. The period between the Ascension and 
Pentecost was nine days, and the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Apostles met 
in the Upper Room and prayed for nine days following Christ’s Ascension. 
Since that time, any group of nine days of prayer is called a novena. Novenas 
are directed to a particular saint and are usually arranged so that the end of 
the novena occurs on the eve or actual liturgical feast day of that saint.
This chapter includes the most well-known novenas still being used today.
Novena of the Miraculous Medal
The Virgin Mary appeared to St. Catherine Laboure in 1830 in Paris and asked 
that she get a medal made which would eventually become known as the 
Miraculous Medal. It has an image of Mary on one side and the letter M on 
the back. Inscribed on the front is the phrase, “O, Mary, conceived without 
sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.”
In addition to promoting the wearing of the Miraculous Medal, St. Catherine 
Laboure also promoted the praying of this novena for nine consecutive days, 
or on the same day for nine consecutive months:
O Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of our Lord Jesus and our Mother, penetrated 
with the most lively confidence in your all-powerful and never-failing intercession, 
manifested so often through the Miraculous Medal, we your loving and trustful chil-
dren implore you to obtain for us the graces and favors we ask during this novena, 
if they be beneficial to our immortal souls, and the souls for whom we pray.
(Insert personal petition here.)

276
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You know, O Mary, how often our souls have been the sanctuaries of your Son 
who hates iniquity.
Obtain for us then a deep hatred of sin and that purity of heart which will attach 
us to God alone so that our every thought, word, and deed may tend to his 
greater glory.
Obtain for us also a spirit of prayer and self-denial that we may recover by pen-
ance what we have lost by sin and at length attain to that blessed abode where 
you are the Queen of angels and of men. Amen.
Novena to St. Joseph
St. Joseph was the Virgin Mary’s husband and Jesus’s adopted or foster 
father. He is invoked as the patron saint of workers, husbands, and a happy 
death. This novena is used to pray for his intercession to obtain a job, find or 
sell a home, or for a dying person to have a peaceful departure. The first part 
of the prayer is said every day, followed by the appropriate prayer for each 
of the nine novena days:
O glorious St. Joseph, faithful follower of Jesus Christ, to you we raise our hearts 
and hands to implore your powerful intercession in obtaining from the benign 
heart of Jesus all the helps and graces necessary for our spiritual and temporal 
welfare, particularly for the grace of a happy death and the special favor we 
now request.
(Insert personal request here.)
O guardian of the Word Incarnate, we feel animated with confidence that your 
prayers in our behalf will be graciously heard before the throne of God.
O glorious St. Joseph, through the love you bear to Jesus Christ and for the glory 
of his name, hear our prayers and obtain our petitions. Amen.
First day
O great St. Joseph, with feelings of unlimited confidence, we beg you to bless 
this novena that we begin in your honor. “You are never invoked in vain,” says 
the seraphic St. Theresa of Jesus.
Be you then to me what you have been to that spouse of the Sacred Heart of 
Jesus and graciously hear me as you did her. Amen.
St. Joseph, pray for us!

Amid the splendors of eternity, forget not the sorrows of those who pray, those

pardon. Amen.
St. Joseph, pray for us!
Third day
Blessed St. Joseph, enkindle in our cold hearts a spark of your charity. May 
God be always the first and only object of our affections. Keep our souls always

of might. Give us your hope that we may stand secure, untouched by doubting, 
steadfast to endure, an understanding heart may bring us peace. Give us your 
purity that the hour of death finds us untouched by evil’s breath. Give us your love 
of labor that we shirk no lot in life that calls us for honest work. Give us your love 
of poverty so that we live contented, let wealth come or go. Give us your courage

Our Lady of Good Remedy
St. John of Matha founded a religious order called the Trinitarians in 1198 to 
ransom Christian slaves and set them free. Trinitarians needed large amounts 
of money and placed their fundraising efforts under the patronage of Mary. 
They were so successful that they were able to free thousands of people. In 
gratitude for her miraculous assistance, St. John of Matha honored Mary with 
the title of Our Lady of Good Remedy. The Church celebrates her feast day 
on October 8. Our Lady of Good Remedy is often depicted as the Virgin Mary 
handing a bag of money to St. John of Matha. This novena is prayed to ask 
Our Lady of Ransom for deliverance from present tribulations:

Remedy comes to the aid of all who call upon thee, extend thy maternal protec-
tion to us. We depend on thee, dear Mother, as helpless and needy children 
depend on a tender and caring mother.

Novena to St. Dominic
St. Dominic de Guzman founded the Order of Preachers, more commonly 
known as the Dominicans, in the 13th century. The Virgin Mary appeared to 
him one day and gave him the Rosary to help battle the Albigensian heresy 
that denied the humanity of Christ. This novena is said before his feast day 
(August 8) to ask his intercession for a particular spiritual assistance:
O renowned champion of the faith of Christ, most holy St. Dominic, who didst 
renounce the honor and dignity of an earthly principality to embrace the poor, 
laborious, and mortified life which should distinguish a disciple of him who has 
said: “If any man will come after me, let him take up his cross and follow me.” 
O burning torch, who being thyself consumed with the fire of divine love, didst 
incessantly labor to enkindle that sacred flame in the hearts of others, look 
down upon me from that throne of glory where thou enjoyest the reward of all 
thy labors, and obtain that some sparks of that blessed fire may be lighted in 
my soul, to animate and encourage me under any crosses or trials with which it 
shall please the divine goodness to visit me. 
Thou, O great saint, regardest as nothing all the afflictions thou didst endure, 
and all the toils thou didst undergo for the promotion of God’s holy cause; 
obtain, I beseech thee, that the same ardent love which strengthened thee, may 
make sweet to me labors, humiliations, disgraces, or whatever other mortifica-
tions I may have to suffer for the name of Jesus. May I ever bear in mind that 
nothing can happen to me but by the particular dispensation of a God who is 
infinitely wise, and therefore knows what is best for my welfare; infinitely pow-
erful, and consequently able to effect it; and above all, infinitely merciful and 
loving, who has laid down his life for my redemption, and continues daily to 
give new proofs of his love and bounty. 
O tender Father of the poor who, when all other resources were exhausted, didst 
offer thyself for their relief, obtain for me that true spirit of compassion for the 
suffering members of Jesus Christ, which shone forth so conspicuously in thy 
holy life. May I, by charity to those whom Jesus so dearly loves, lay up for myself 
treasures in heaven, where thou now enjoyest that which the eye hath not seen, 
nor the ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, but which God has prepared 
for those who love him, and who prove themselves his disciples by the obser-
vance of his divine precept “love one another.” 
I praise and thank God for the high degree of sanctity to which he has raised 
thee, and the special privileges by which he has distinguished thee. I conjure 
thee, by that gratitude with which thou shalt for all eternity be penetrated for thy

divine benefactor, implore for me the grace to root out of my heart whatever is 
not agreeable in his sight, especially that evil habit by which I most frequently 
offend him. Obtain likewise the favors I request in this novena, through thy pow-
erful intercession.

O glorious Mother of God, Queen of the most sacred Rosary, thou who didst love 
Dominic with the affection of a mother, and were most tenderly loved and hon-
ored by him, look upon me, for his sake, with an eye of pity, deign to join with 
him in presenting these petitions to thy most Blessed Jesus. I sincerely desire 
from this moment to love him with all my heart, and serve him with all my 
strength, and now place myself under thy powerful protection, as a sure means 
of obtaining all the graces necessary to serve him faithfully here, that I may eter-
nally rejoice with him hereafter. Amen.
Novena to St. Jude Thaddeus
St. Jude Thaddeus was one of the original 12 Apostles. He wrote an epistle in 
the New Testament and is considered a relative, possibly a cousin, of Jesus. 
He is known as the patron saint of hopeless cases or difficult situations. This 
novena asks his intercession and, in return, persons who have their prayers 
answered typically promote devotion to St. Jude:
Most holy apostle, St. Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the Church 
honors and invokes you universally, as the patron of difficult cases, of things 
almost despaired of, pray for me, I am so helpless and alone.
Intercede with God for me that he bring visible and speedy help where help is 
almost despaired of. Come to my assistance in this great need that I may receive 
the consolation and help of heaven in all my necessities, tribulations, and suffer-
ings, particularly

and that I may praise God with you and all the saints forever. I promise, O 
Blessed St. Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor granted me by God and to 
always honor you as my special and powerful patron, and to gratefully encour-
age devotion to you. Amen.

husband, as well as of many other spiritual and temporal requests. Say once 
a day for nine days, especially beginning on July 17 and ending on July 25, the

Novena to St. Michael the Archangel
St. Michael is the archangel of the Bible who fought Lucifer (now known 
as Satan, or the devil), the bad angel that rebelled against God along with 
one-third of the angelic community. Michael and the other two-thirds of the 
angels defeated the evil ones. The good went into heaven, and the bad were 
cast into hell. This novena to him goes back many centuries, as does devo-
tion to all angels as messengers of God and agents of divine protection.
Glorious St. Michael, guardian and defender of the Church of Jesus Christ, 
come to the assistance of his followers, against whom the powers of hell are 
unchained. Guard with special care our Holy Father, the Pope, and our bishops, 
priests, all our religious and lay people, and especially the children.
St. Michael, watch over us during life, defend us against the assaults of the 
demon, and assist us especially at the hour of death. Help us achieve the happi-
ness of beholding God face to face for all eternity. Amen.
St. Michael, intercede for me with God in all my necessities, especially
(Insert personal intention here.)
Obtain for me a favorable outcome in the matter I recommend to you. Mighty 
prince of the heavenly host, and victor over rebellious spirits, remember me for 
I am weak and sinful and so prone to pride and ambition. Be for me, I pray, my 
powerful aid in temptation and difficulty, and above all do not forsake me in my 
last struggle with the powers of evil. Amen.

Ten Popular Shrines of the Saints
In This Chapter
▶ Shrines in Europe
▶ Shrines in the United States
A
popular form of piety in the Middle Ages involved making a pilgrimage — 
a journey to a religious place. Aside from obvious locations like the Holy 
Land where Jesus was born, lived, died, and rose from the dead, the travel-
ing faithful often visit shrines of the saints. This chapter highlights ten such 
shrines, whether they be the actual burial site for an individual saint or a spot 
dedicated in his or her honor.
Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi
The basilica of St. Francis is in the medieval Italian town of Assisi, 90 miles 
north of Rome. The basilica is dedicated to the saint who, along with St. 
Dominic in the 13th century, established the mendicant orders of the 
Franciscans and Dominicans, respectively.
Construction of the church began two years after Francis’s death in 1226; it 
wasn’t completed until 1253. It was built on land donated by Francis’s friend, 
Simone di Pucciarello. St. Francis’s remains are interred in the lower church. 
Southwest of the basilica is the Sacro Convento (Sacred Convent), which 
includes papal apartments for visiting popes and is not open to the public.
The basilica was damaged in an earthquake in 1997 in which four people 
died. The lower level was undamaged, and the upper level has been repaired.

Catedral de Santiago de Compostela
This Spanish cathedral in the northwest town of Santiago de Compostela 
was built over the grave of St. James the Greater after the earlier church 
was destroyed by the Moors. Construction of the structure, with its Baroque 
facade, started in 1060 and was completed in 1211. St. James’s remains were 
discovered in AD 819, and the earlier church was built over his grave.
The 12th-century Portico da Gloria, behind the western facade, is a central 
highlight of the cathedral. It follows the style of the Romanesque period and 
was built by Master Mateo between 1168 and 1188. Other features include the 
famous Botafumeiro, or incense burner; a pulley mechanism used to swing 
the burner is located in a dome above the crossing. The Botafumeiro, built by 
Jose Losada in 1851, is the largest censer in the world — it’s 5 feet, 3 inches 
tall and weighs 176 pounds.
One of the largest Romanesque churches of Spain (if not all of Europe), the 
Catedral de Santiago de Compostela is third only to Lourdes and Fatima in 
the number of pilgrims that visit each year and in popularity among the faith-
ful. Before the Marian apparitions in those other locations, this was the pre-
mier pilgrimage site, second only to Rome itself.
Cologne Cathedral
The Cologne Cathedral in Cologne, Germany (the Kölner Dom), is dedicated 
to both St. Peter and the Virgin Mary. It’s believed that the church possesses 
the relics of the Magi who visited the Christ child, as recounted in the second 
chapter of the Gospel According to St. Matthew.
Construction of the cathedral was started in the 13th century on the ruins of 
a 4th-century Roman temple and took more than 600 years to complete. The 
cornerstone was laid on August 15, 1248, and the work was finally finished in 
1880 in the presence of King of Prussia and first German Emperor Wilhelm I.
World War II aerial bombs hit the church 14 times, but the building survived.
Besides housing the relics of the Magi, the Cologne Cathedral also has the 
Gero Cross (Gero-Kreuz), carved in AD 976, the oldest surviving monumental 
crucifix north of the Alps. In the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, inside the cathe-
dral, is the Madonna of Milan (Mailänder Madonna), an exquisite wooden 
sculpture depicting Mary and the child Jesus from the year 1290. Another 
jewel of the cathedral is the Chapel of the Virgin (Marienkapelle), where the 
painting of the Patron Saints of Köln by Stefan Lochner (1442) is displayed.

291
 Chapter 21: Ten Popular Shrines of the Saints
House of the Virgin Mary
According to pious tradition, the Virgin Mary lived under the care of St. John 
the Beloved (also known as John the Evangelist) in Ephesus (on the western 
coast of modern-day Turkey) until her Assumption into heaven sometime 
before the end of the first century. The Gospel of John tells of Jesus giving his 
mother to the care of the Beloved Disciple just before his death on the cross 
(John 19:26–27), and history records that John lived in Ephesus both before 
and after his exile to the island of Patmos.
Often confused with the Cathedral Meryem Kilisesi (Turkish for “Mary’s 
Church”), where the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus convened in AD 431, the 
House of the Virgin Mary (called Meryem Ana Evi in Turkish) in Ephesus is 
the home where believers contend the Virgin Mary lived in her later years. 
Now a shrine, it has an altar where Mass is celebrated in addition to a place 
of prayer and reflection for other religions.
Pope Paul VI visited the House of the Virgin Mary in 1967, Pope John Paul II 
came in 1979, and Pope Benedict XVI visited in 2006. Every year, pilgrims 
flock to this shrine, especially on the Feast of the Assumption, August 15, 
which commemorates Mary’s body and soul being taken up to heaven by her 
Divine Son, Jesus. The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics call this the 
Feast of the Holy Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
La Madeleine
La Madeleine is a church dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene in Paris, France. 
Construction started during the reign of King Louis XV in 1764, and the 
church was first designed by Constant d’Ivry. A second architect who favored 
a design imitating the Roman Pantheon wasn’t well received, and work came 
to a halt from 1790 to 1806.
Emperor Napoleon decided to erect a “temple of glory” to his Grand Army, 
and he commissioned Pierre-Alexandre Vignon as imperial architect. Workers 
leveled what remained from the first efforts on the church and started build-
ing what was to be a Greek-like temple. King Louis XVIII ordered in 1814 that 
the Madeleine should be a church, but in 1837 it was almost designated the 
first railway station of Paris. The Madeleine was finally consecrated a church 
in 1842. The exterior is surrounded by large Corinthian columns and a frieze 
of the Last Judgment above the portico. A painting by Ziegler in the chancel 
depicts the history of Christianity, with the Emperor Napoleon conspicuously 
in the forefront.

St. Peter’s Basilica
Most of the liturgical celebrations in Rome take place in St. Peter’s Basilica, 
the residence of the Holy Father.
The Circus of Nero, the site of St. Peter’s death in AD 64, was held on the site 
where St. Peter’s Basilica now stands. St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor 
Constantine, convinced her son to build a church in AD 324 over the tomb of 
this special saint.
Pope Nicholas V decided in the mid-15th century that the old basilica should 
be rebuilt and hired architect Bernardo Rossellino to start renovating the 
old church. Both died before completion, and Pope Sixtus IV had the Sistine 
Chapel built instead.
Pope Julius II commissioned construction on the existing basilica in 1506, 
and it was completed in 1626 under Pope Paul V. The first chief architect was 
Donato Bramante, followed by Raphael. Michelangelo then served as main 
architect and designed the famous dome, while Bernini designed the great 
colonnade, with 140 statues atop, circling the piazza of St. Peter’s Square.
A crypt containing the remains of St. Peter and other popes — including Pope 
John Paul the Great — is located under the main church. Over the actual 
tomb is a 927-ton bronze baldacchino (canopy) reaching 90 feet tall; under 
this canopy is the altar at which the pope celebrates Holy Mass.
 
St. Peter’s is the largest church in the world, covering 5.7 acres and capable of 
holding 60,000 people inside. The basilica welcomes the greatest number of 
visitors each year and hosted the largest number of heads of state, presidents, 
prime ministers, and monarchs gathered together during the funeral of Pope 
John Paul II in 2005.
The pope has general audiences with the public outside in the piazza in front 
of the basilica when the weather allows. When the weather is bad, audiences 
are held inside the Pope Paul VI hall, adjacent to the Vatican.
St. Peter’s Basilica lies inside the independent nation of Vatican City, the 
smallest sovereign nation on earth (100 acres and 900 citizens).
St. Stephen’s Basilica
This church honoring St. Stephen, king and now patron saint of Hungary, is 
the largest in the nation. Construction of the church, which holds the incor-
rupt right hand of the saintly monarch, was started in 1855 and completed 50 
years later, in 1905. The basilica is said to hold 8,500 people and is second in 
size only to St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.

293
 Chapter 21: Ten Popular Shrines of the Saints
Visitors can see the city of Budapest from the top of the basilica. A statue 
of St. Stephen, made of white Carrara marble by Alajos Strobl, stands in the 
middle of the high altar. The church is also home to the largest bell in the 
country, weighing in at 9 tons.
Sanctuaire d’Ars
Pope Benedict XVI declared St. John Vianney patron of all priests in his “Year 
for Priests” letter in June 2009; prior to that time, he had been the patron 
saint of diocesan parish priests. His final resting place in a small town in 
France has become a popular shrine for millions of pilgrims.
Ars, a small community northwest of Lyons and 250 miles south of Paris, 
was a spiritually desolate place at the time of St. John Vianney (see Chapter 
5). The would-be saint was unsure of his direction when traveling to Ars and 
stopped to ask a young boy for help. When the boy told him the proper road 
to follow, John thanked the boy and said, “You have shown me the way to 
Ars; now I will show you the way to heaven.”
The original church John served now stands as the nave of the basilica built 
after his death. His incorrupt body is located in the shrine in his honor. 
Several side chapels John had built onto the church still remain, and a sepa-
rate chapel — the Chapel of the Heart — houses the relic of John’s heart, 
which was removed from his body.
St. Patrick’s Cathedral
The building that now stands as St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City 
replaced an earlier and smaller church. Old St. Patrick’s, the earlier church, 
is the oldest Catholic building in New York and remains a functioning parish. 
The new St. Patrick’s Cathedral was designed by American architect James 
Renwick. Construction started in 1858 but was interrupted by the Civil War. It 
was finally opened and consecrated in 1879.
The original proposed site for the cathedral was a countryside area thought 
to be too far from the inner city. Then-Archbishop Hughes persevered in his 
vision of building the most beautiful Gothic cathedral in the New World, in 
what eventually would become the heart of the city.
The cathedral is dedicated to the patron saint of the Roman Catholic arch-
diocese of New York and the patron saint of Ireland, St. Patrick. Many Irish 
immigrants helped fund and build the current church, and most of the arch-
bishops who served as spiritual shepherds of the archdiocese were of Irish

ancestry. More than 100 parishioners pledged $1,000 each, and thousands of 
Irish Americans donated their pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters to pay 
for this elegant house of worship.
St. Patrick’s Cathedral is a Gothic building made of white marble and stone 
that seats approximately 2,400 people. The St. Michael and St. Louis altar 
was designed by Tiffany’s, and the St. Elizabeth altar was designed by Paolo 
Medici of Rome. The cathedral also contains a statue of St. Elizabeth Ann 
Seton, the first American-born saint.
The stained-glass windows came from Chartres, France; Birmingham, 
England; and Boston, Massachusetts. The cathedral’s replica of 
Michelangelo’s Pieta statue is three times larger than the original in Rome.
More than 3 million people visit St. Patrick’s Cathedral every year. Pope Paul VI 
visited in 1964, Pope John Paul II visited in 1979, and Pope Benedict XVI 
visited in 2008. St. Patrick’s hosted the most funerals of the firefighters who 
died during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center 
on September 11, 2001. Wakes and/or funeral masses were also held there for 
Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Governor Alfred E. Smith, and Prime Minister Jan 
Ignace Paderewski of Poland, as well as for Babe Ruth, Vince Lombardi, and 
Joe DiMaggio.
St. Spiridon Orthodox Cathedral
St. Spiridon was an Eastern Orthodox Christian saint who lived in the fourth 
century. This cathedral dedicated in his honor is in Seattle, Washington, and 
was built by the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) in 1895 to minister to 
the needs of Greek, Russian, and Serbian immigrants of the Orthodox faith.
The Greeks formed their own church in 1918 and built St. Demetrios 
Greek Orthodox Church in 1921. An estimated 6,000 Russian refugees fled 
Communist persecution and traveled to Seattle in the aftermath of the 
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917. The current cathedral was built in 
1941 and resembles the famous onion-domed Russian churches, whereas 
the old St. Spiridon looked more like the typical New England Puritan-style 
meetinghouses.

Chapter 22
Ten Saintly Families
In This Chapter
▶ The Holy Family
▶ Saintly relatives and friends of Jesus
▶ Others who spread the faith around the world
T
his chapter introduces the ten most famous saintly families, from the 
Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph to St. Cyril and St. Methodius.
 
There’s no such thing as a “holiness gene,” so when more than one member of 
a family becomes a saint, it’s likely because of good examples rather than 
good ancestry. One saintly member of a family has a profound influence on his 
relatives, particularly his siblings.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph
The most obvious family of saints is the Holy Family: Jesus, Mary, and 
Joseph. Though Joseph wasn’t the biological father of Jesus, his marriage to 
Mary created a legal paternal bond, according to both the ancient world and 
Hebrew culture.
Saints Matthew and Luke give detailed genealogies for Jesus through his 
adopted father, showing that Joseph is a descendant of both King Solomon 
and King David, as well as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. St. Luke’s list takes the 
genealogy back to Adam.
Joseph is noted in the Bible when Jesus was 12 years old and went missing. 
Mary and Joseph find him three days later in the Temple of Jerusalem, teach-
ing the teachers. Little else is said about Joseph in the Bible except that he’s 
the husband of Mary and the father of Jesus.

296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Some Eastern Orthodox churches believe Joseph may have had other 
children from a previous marriage in which his wife died, but the Catholic 
Church believes he had no other children. Rather, Joseph may have inherited 
nieces and nephews from a deceased brother or sister.
We detail the Holy Family’s story in Chapter 2, beginning with Mary learning 
that she, a virgin betrothed to the carpenter Joseph, would give birth to the 
Christ child, and running through Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection.
St. Joachim and St. Ann (Grandparents)
Mary’s parents, Joachim and Ann, are named in the apocryphal Gospel of 
James, a writing that’s considered not to have been divinely inspired and 
is therefore not included in the Catholic Bible. The two aren’t named at all 
in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, but they’re mentioned in 
several non-canonical, or unofficial, Scripture sources. Joachim and Ann are 
believed to be Jesus’s maternal grandparents and are the patron saints of all 
grandparents. Because Mary was probably in her late teens when she mar-
ried Joseph, it’s entirely possible that Joachim and Ann were not only still 
alive for the birth of their grandson but also may have visited on occasion.
St. Elizabeth, St. Zachariah, and St. John 
the Baptist (Cousins of the Lord)
The Gospel of Luke identifies Elizabeth as Mary’s cousin and Zachariah as 
Elizabeth’s husband. The couple is childless and elderly when Gabriel visits 
Zachariah and tells him his barren wife will give birth to a son. Zachariah, 
in his shock and disbelief, is speechless until the child, John the Baptist, 
is born. Mary visits Elizabeth during her sixth month of pregnancy, when 
Mary herself is just a few days into her own pregnancy. The meeting of the 
two women is called the Visitation and is one of the Joyful Mysteries of the 
Rosary (see Chapter 2).
When Mary enters Elizabeth’s room, Elizabeth’s unborn child leaps for 
joy inside his mother as he miraculously recognizes the presence of the 
Savior. Still inside his mother’s womb, John the Baptist starts his mission to 
announce the arrival of the Messiah. John is not mentioned again until the 
two young cousins have grown to adulthood.

297
 Chapter 22: Ten Saintly Families 
 
John the Baptist was so named not because he belonged to the Baptist Church 
(which was established by John Smyth in 1608) but because he baptized 
people at the Jordan River. The Greek word baptizein means to wash; John 
was symbolically washing the faithful in preparation for the Savior and 
Redeemer (Jesus), so he was given the title “the Baptist.”
John baptized Jesus at the Jordan. The two aren’t mentioned together again 
until Jesus learns of his cousin’s death three years later (see Chapter 6).
St. Martha, St. Mary, and St. Lazarus
Martha, Mary, and Lazarus were siblings with whom Jesus established a 
close friendship as an adult. Scholars believe that the four were very close, 
and Jesus spent time relaxing with this family during his three-year mission.
The Gospel of John states that Jesus wept at Lazarus’s tomb, only the second 
time the Bible mentions him crying. (The first is when Jesus weeps over 
the city of Jerusalem as he prophesies its destruction, later done by the 
Romans.) Jesus’s tears show the crowd the depth of the men’s friendship, 
and the Gospel of John tells how Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead after 
he’s in the tomb for four days.
St. Peter and St. Andrew
Peter and his brother Andrew were fishermen and some of the first men 
whom Jesus chose to be his apostles. Andrew was first a disciple of John 
the Baptist when he encountered Jesus; upon realizing that Jesus was the 
Messiah, he went to his brother Peter and introduced him to Christ. Jesus 
invited both brothers to join him to become “fishers of men,” meaning that 
they would catch souls by preaching the Gospel.
 
Jesus gives Peter charge of the Church in Matthew 16:18, and Peter is there-
fore considered the first Bishop of Rome and the first pope; he was martyred 
in the capital of the empire around AD 64.
Peter’s brother Andrew got as far as Greece before his martyrdom and is the 
patron saint of Scotland and Russia. Peter was crucified upside down, as he 
felt unworthy to die exactly like Jesus did on Good Friday (he denied knowing 
Christ three times the day Jesus died). Andrew was crucified on a cross that 
resembled the letter X.

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
St. James and St. John
James and John were brothers and were fishermen like Peter and Andrew. 
Their mother asked Jesus if her sons could sit to the right and left of him, 
securing a good assignment. The other apostles were jealous, but Jesus 
did often call on the two siblings, along with Peter. One such example is 
the Transfiguration, when Jesus took just Peter, James, and John up Mount 
Tabor, where Moses and Elijah appeared out of nowhere and stood side by 
side next to Jesus. Peter, James, and John also accompanied Jesus to the 
Garden of Gethsemane to pray before his Crucifixion, only to be found asleep 
three times by Christ.
John is the author of one of the four Gospels, an epistle, and the last book 
of the Bible, the Book of Revelation (also known as the Apocalypse). He is 
called the Beloved Disciple because, among the 12 Apostles, he was conspic-
uously the best friend to Jesus. James is called the Greater to distinguish 
him from the other St. James the Apostle, known as the Less, so named only 
because of the chronological meetings of the two men and Jesus.
According to pious tradition, James preached all the way to Spain before his 
death by Herod’s sword, whereas John died a natural death of old age, prob-
ably around age 100. One attempt was made to boil John alive in hot oil, but 
he didn’t die (see Chapter 3). Exiled to the island of Patmos, St. John ended 
up in Ephesus, where he had previously spent many years taking care of the 
Virgin Mary.
St. Macrina the Elder, Grandmother 
of St. Macrina the Younger, Basil the 
Great, St. Gregory of Nyssa, and 
St. Peter of Sebaste
Macrina the Elder lived in the last half of the third century AD and the first 
half of the fourth. She was the mother of St. Basil the Elder and had a great 
influence on her family, as evidenced by the numerous saints who came 
from that same gene pool. Basil the Elder and his wife Emmelia had several 
children who became saints, including Basil the Great, Gregory, Peter, and 
Macrina the Younger.

299
 Chapter 22: Ten Saintly Families 
The family lived during the Roman persecution of Diocletian and never 
abandoned the faith, as did some of their contemporaries. Basil the Great is 
known as the father of Eastern monasticism, and he and Gregory are also rec-
ognized as Eastern Fathers of the Church (see Chapter 16).
St. Felicity and Her Sons: St. Januarius, 
St. Felix, St. Philip, St. Silvanus, St. 
Alexander, St. Vitalis, and St. Martial
Felicity of Rome lived in the second century AD and was devoted to the poor. 
She was arrested for her faith and ordered to worship pagan gods. Her seven 
sons — Januarius, Felix, Philip, Silvanus, Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial — 
were arrested when she refused. They were ordered to worship the Roman 
deities, and they followed their mother’s example and refused to commit 
idolatry.
After they made several appeals to judges, all of which were rejected, 
Emperor Antonius ordered the mother and her sons executed. Felicity was 
forced to watch her children murdered one by one, yet none of them flinched 
and none denied the Christian faith.
St. Benedict and St. Scholastica
Benedict and Scholastica (see Chapter 9) were sixth-century twins and co-
founders of Western monasticism. St. Benedict started many monasteries of 
men, later to be known as Benedictines, while his sister Scholastica estab-
lished monasteries for women. Monastic life involves a commitment to one 
place (monastery) and daily prayer and work (ora et labora in Latin).
St. Benedict established the monasteries of Subiaco and Monte Cassino, 
both famous sites in Italy and still fully functioning monasteries to this day. 
St. Scholastica set up a monastery of Benedictine nuns 5 miles from Monte 
Cassino in a town called Plombariola.
The two met once a year and conferred on spiritual matters, as they regarded 
the residents of their monasteries as their spiritual brothers and sisters.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
St. Boris and St. Gleb
Boris and Gleb were brothers, sons of St. Vladimir I of Kiev and grandchildren 
of St. Olga, the first Christian queen of Ukraine. They lived in tenth-century 
Ukraine. Vladimir continued his mother’s work of promoting the Christian 
religion in the realm.
After Vladimir’s death, the kingdom was supposed to be divided among his 
sons, but Boris and Gleb’s eldest half-brother Svyatopolk, who denied the 
faith and despised his brothers’ religiosity, greedily sought to rule alone. 
Boris was supported by an army but he called them off, explaining that 
he couldn’t raise a hand against his own brother, no matter how badly his 
brother treated him. Boris was later martyred by Svyatopolk’s henchmen. 
Svyatopolk invited Gleb to Kiev, but Gleb was martyred on the journey.
St. Cosmas and St. Damian
Cosmas and Damian were twin brothers who lived near the seaport of Aegea 
(modern-day Ayas in Turkey) in the Gulf of Issus in the third century AD. 
They were both physicians, and neither charged anyone for medical services. 
Patrons of pharmacists, these two were martyred under the Roman persecu-
tion of Diocletian.
Their most famous miraculous cure was the grafting of a leg from a recently 
deceased Ethiopian to replace a patient’s ulcerated leg. According to pious 
tradition, they were hung on a cross and subsequently stoned, shot with 
arrows, and finally beheaded.
St. Cyril and St. Methodius
Cyril and Methodius were brothers who lived in the eighth century AD. Born in 
Thessalonica, Greece, they became missionaries to Eastern Europe and spread 
the Christian faith to the Slavic peoples. Their message got as far as Russia.
Their feast day is February 14, also known as St. Valentine’s Day. Pope John 
Paul II named them copatrons of Europe (along with St. Benedict of Nursia) in 
1980 because of their mutual influence on the spread of the faith. Cyril is given 
credit for devising the Cyrillic alphabet, which the Russians still use today.

N
o book on saints would be complete without giving 
you the information you really need: who to call on 
when you need assistance with a particular circumstance 
or issue. For example, if you’re missing something, you 
can look up the patron saint of lost items (St. Anthony) 
and ask for his help. If you have eyesight troubles, you 
can look up the patron saint of that malady (St. Lucy) and 
seek her intercession. We also give you a long list of 
patron saints for places (like St. Patrick and Ireland) and 
for occupations (like St. Joseph Cupertino and airline 
pilots).
While we’re at it, we provide a comprehensive listing of 
feast days for the saints, starting with the Solemnity of 
Mary on January 1 and going clear through to the Feast of 
Pope Sylvester on December 31.

Appendix C
Calendar of Feast Days 
for the Saints
E
ach day of the calendar year is a day of celebration in the Catholic 
Church. Jesus, Mary, and the saints are honored on various days, either 
with solemnity days or feast days. Solemnities are the highest ranking days 
and are usually holy days of obligation, while feast days generally include spe-
cific Scripture readings and prayers.
The feast days listed in bold in this appendix are obligatory observances 
for the Catholic Church in the United States. The others are either optional 
or are observed in other countries. Feasts of Our Lord Jesus Christ or the
