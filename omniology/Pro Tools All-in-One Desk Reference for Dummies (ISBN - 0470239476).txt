Dedication
I am especially grateful for the love and support of my wife Beth and my
daughter Tovah, who never cease to amaze me with their capacity to endure
non-stop recording talk.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have happened without the inspiration and vision of
Executive Editor Steve Hayes. This is my fourth book with Steve; this one was
just as much fun to do as the others. A hearty thanks to my agent Carol Susan
Roth for making sure I get what’s coming to me.
Books, by nature, are a team effort and this book is the result of an extremely
talented and dedicated team of professionals: Project Editor Jean Nelson, who
kept this book on track with her attention to detail and exceptional editorial
skills; Copy Editor Teresa Artman, who cleaned up my writing and helped me
look like I actually know how to write; and Technical Editor Erik Scull, who
offered many excellent insights and ideas to improve this book. I’m indebted
to you all.

Introduction
C
hances are that after you became interested in recording some music,
you started hearing about a great software program — Pro Tools.
Maybe you read an article in which an artist said that she records with Pro
Tools, or you heard that such-and-such major recording studio uses Pro
Tools, or a friend told you that you need Pro Tools to record professional-
quality music. Of the many great recording programs that are available, the
most popular — and one of the most powerful — is Pro Tools.
Pro Tools is an audio and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) record-
ing program. Aside from recording audio and MIDI tracks, Pro Tools offers
some of the most powerful editing functions available, allowing you to tweak
your recordings to a high level of detail, clarity, and accuracy. You also get
excellent mixing abilities that help you mix your tracks together, EQ (equal-
ize) them, and apply effects. Pro Tools is a comprehensive, all-in-one pro-
gram you can use to control your music from start to finish.
About This Book
Pro Tools All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition, not only intro-
duces you to Pro Tools audio- and MIDI-recording software, but it also pre-
sents basic multitrack recording techniques. You find out about the many
Pro Tools features and functions and ways to use this program to create the
best possible recordings of your music.
This book also acquaints you with the basic audio-engineering skills needed
to make high-quality recordings. These skills can save you countless hours
of experimenting and give you more time to actually record your music.
(What a concept!)
In this book, you can
✦Explore the Pro Tools windows and menus.
✦Get a handle on all the useful functions within Pro Tools.
✦Discover the ins and outs of using the various pieces of equipment in
your studio.
✦Explore tried-and-true engineering techniques, such as microphone
choice and placement.

Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
2
✦Find out about multitracking, mixing, and mastering.
✦Get a chance to turn your music into complete songs and also discover
how to assemble and release an album.
With this book in hand, you’re on the fast track toward creating great-sounding
CDs. I cut to the chase, showing you skills you can use right away. I don’t
bother you with tons of technical jargon or useless facts.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
I have to admit that when I wrote this book, I made a couple of assumptions
about you, the reader. (And we all know what happens when you ASSume
anything.) But what the heck, I did it anyway. First, I assume that you’re
interested in recording your music (or someone else’s) with Pro Tools LE or
M-Powered software.
I also assume that you’re relatively new at the recording game and not yet a
seasoned professional. Of course, if you are an audio engineer — maybe
making the leap from analog to digital — this book offers a great brush-up on
many audio-engineering fundamentals and how they apply to the basic func-
tions of Pro Tools. Oh, and I assume that you play a musical instrument or
sing — or are at least familiar with how instruments function and how sound
is produced, as well as understand some of the basics of music theory such
as tempo, meter, measures, and time signature. Finally, I assume that you
have some basic computer skills and know how to navigate menus, and work
a mouse and qwerty keyboard.
Other than these things, I don’t assume that you play a certain type of music
or that you ever intend to try to make it in the music business (or even that
you want to treat it as a business at all).
Conventions Used in This Book
I use certain conventions in this book to explain how to use the Pro Tools
program. For example, when you choose items from the main menu, I indi-
cate this with arrows, as in “Choose Options➪Scrolling➪No Scrolling.” This
is shorthand for “Click the Options menu on the main menu, mouse over the
Scrolling option, and finally, click No Scrolling on the submenu.”
When you need to type a number or text, I indicate this with bold: For exam-
ple, type Larry in the Name field. I make Web sites stand out a bit from the
rest of the text with a monospace font, such as www.dummies.com.

Because Pro Tools is available for both Macs and PCs, I include the com-
mands or shortcut keys for both Mac and PC when they differ. For example,
press Ô+N (Mac) or Ctrl+N (PC).
Finally, the Windows key is the key on a PC’s keyboard (just outward from
each Alt key on the bottom key row) that is labeled only with a Windows
logo. This key can activate various Pro Tools features, but some older non-
Microsoft keyboards don’t have it. If you have a PC without a Microsoft-style
keyboard and it doesn’t have that pesky Windows key, don’t worry: I show
you other possible ways to activate the same features.
How This Book Is Organized
This desk reference is organized so that you can find the information you
want quickly and easily. Each mini-book contains chapters that cover a spe-
cific part of the recording process, and I briefly describe each mini-book in
the following sections.
Book I: Home Recording Basics
Book I introduces you to the basics of home recording. Chapter 1 introduces
you to the components of a home studio, explaining what everything is for.
Chapter 2 shows you how to make the connections — both analog and 
digital — that you need when you’re trying to get sound from one place to
another.
Chapter 3 acquaints you with the mixing board, introducing you to its many
functions. Chapter 4 demystifies MIDI and gives you practical advice on how
to use this powerful communication tool to enhance your music. Chapter 5
puts you inside the world of microphones. You get a chance to understand
what kinds of mics are available, how they work, and which ones work best
for different situations.
Book II: Getting Started Using Pro Tools
Book II leads you into the Pro Tools world, examining the software and the
Digidesign hardware that you need in order to run it. Chapter 1 helps you
configure your computer to run Pro Tools and walks you through installing
the software on a Mac or a PC. Chapter 2 introduces you to the available
Digidesign hardware options, provides a basic overview of many of the 
M-Powered compatible interfaces made by M-Audio, and shows you where
and how to plug in everything.

Chapter 3 helps you make your hardware and software work together and
introduces you to sessions, which are the standard building blocks of the
Pro Tools song-file system. In Chapter 4, you examine the three windows in
Pro Tools — Transport, Edit, and Mix — where you do most of your work.
Book II finishes off with Chapter 5, which gets you up to speed on file formats
and compatibility in Pro Tools. You discover ways to import and export
various file types.
Book III: Recording Audio
Book III gets into the meat of actually recording music. Chapter 1 explains
tracks in Pro Tools and discusses setting them up properly. Chapter 2
explores the fundamentals of getting a good source sound from micro-
phones. You discover which mics work best for certain instruments and 
how to place those microphones for the best sound.
Chapter 3 helps you get ready to record your first track. You discover how 
to set levels, enable recording, and monitor your input signals so that you
can hear yourself. This book ends with Chapter 4, in which you begin the
process of recording single or multiple tracks in Pro Tools. Chapter 4 also
shows you how to listen critically (but practically) to those tracks when you
play them back.
Book IV: Editing Audio
Book IV is all about editing the audio tracks that you record. Chapter 1
explains the basics of editing audio in Pro Tools, from knowing which of the
four edit modes to use on your music to using the Audio Region list and
playlists to find the material to edit. Chapter 2 gets you comfortable with
selecting the material you want to edit. You find out how to change a selec-
tion and hear it before you edit it as well as how to use memory locators to
move quickly from one part of your session to another.
Chapter 3 gets to the heart of editing in Pro Tools. You get used to working
with regions (the standard on-screen representations of the music you
recorded in Pro Tools), using the editing commands, and using looped mate-
rial to turn your raw tracks into usable pieces. This book ends with Chapter
4, in which you step up your editing prowess by exploring the Smart tool
and other advanced editing features.
Book V: Managing MIDI
Pro Tools offers full-featured MIDI functionality. In this mini-book, you get up
to speed on recording and editing MIDI data in your sessions. Chapter 1
helps you set up your MIDI devices. Chapter 2 gets you started capturing

How This Book Is Organized
5
MIDI data by showing you how to create MIDI and instrument tracks and
then record your performance. Chapter 3 presents the many Pro Tools edit-
ing functions that you can use to improve on your performance. Chapter 4
explores MIDI operations, those specialized commands that you can use to
transform your MIDI data in numerous ways.
Book VI: Mixing in Pro Tools
Book VI helps you take your tracks and blend them to create a finished song.
Chapter 1 introduces you to the process of multitrack mixing and helps you
prepare yourself to mix. Chapter 2 walks you through the process of setting
up your Pro Tools session for mixing. Chapter 3 details equalization (EQ)
and how you can use it to make all your instruments fit together well.
Chapter 4 examines four types of dynamics processors: compressors, lim-
iters, gates, and expanders. These processors are essential to getting your
instruments to sit in the mix (sound good together), and this chapter helps
you use them properly. Chapter 5 guides you into the world of effect proces-
sors, such as reverb and delay. These effects are useful for adding life to
your productions, and this chapter shows you some ways to use them 
effectively.
Chapter 6 covers one of the most useful things about recording with Pro
Tools: automating the elements of your mix, such as levels, panning, effects,
and so on. Chapter 7 finishes off Book VI by showing you how to mix to a
stereo file.
Book VII: Mastering with Pro Tools
Book VII focuses on the often-misunderstood process of mastering music.
Chapter 1 details what mastering is and helps you determine whether you
want to give it a try or let a professional do it for you. Chapter 2 provides a
step-by-step plan to help you in the event that you want to try your hand at
the mastering game.
Book VIII: Getting Your Music to the Masses
Book VIII helps you break out of your cocoon so that you can share your fin-
ished music with others. Chapter 1 covers how to choose CD-Rs and burn
your music to them. You also explore the best ways to make copies of your
CDs. If you’re looking to cultivate an audience in cyberspace, Chapter 2
helps you make your music available on the Internet. You get a chance
to format your music for Internet distribution and discover some ways to
promote your band.

Icons Used in This Book
Like all For Dummies authors, I use a few icons to help you along your way.
Certain techniques are very important and deserve remembering. This icon
gives you a gentle nudge to keep you on track.
Throughout the book, this icon shows up in instances where I include tech-
nical background on certain subjects. When you see this icon, brace yourself
for some dense information. Skip these if you want.
This icon highlights expert advice and ideas that can help you produce
better recordings.
This icon warns you ahead of time about instances when you could damage
your equipment, your ears, or your song.
Where to Go from Here
This book is set up so that you can read it cover to cover (and progressively
build on your knowledge). Or, be a free spirit and jump around to read only
those parts that interest you at the time. For instance, if you’re getting ready
to record a mix of your song and need some ideas on how to use equaliza-
tion (EQ), go to Book VI, Chapter 3. If you’re new to recording with Pro Tools
and want to know how to set up a session, check out Book II, Chapter 3. And
if you’re completely new to the whole concept of home recording, start at
the beginning with Book I, Chapter 1.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the components of a home studio
 Discovering how each component contributes to the final sound
W
hether you use a PC- or Mac-based system for your Pro Tools studio,
your home recording system of choice employs much of the same
basic technology. In fact, your simple Pro Tools studio consists of the same
basic components as a typical million-dollar professional studio complex.
In this chapter, you discover the purpose of each component of a home
recording studio, and you also discover how each of these components
relates to the quality of sound you ultimately get from your studio. This
knowledge will help you to spend the right amount of money on the right
stuff. (See Book II, Chapter 1 for more on purchasing gear.)
Eyeing the Big Picture
In spite of what you might surmise from this chapter — with its long list of
equipment — you need only a few things to do multitrack recording with
Pro Tools. This simple list comprises instruments and microphones (called
input devices), a computer, a Digidesign audio interface or compatible M-
Audio audio interface, Pro Tools LE or M-Powered (for the M-Audio inter-
faces) software, and monitors (speakers, to you home stereo enthusiasts).
No matter how complicated your system becomes and how many pieces of
gear you end up accumulating, your studio will still consist of these basic
parts.
This chapter breaks down recording systems into the components they
have to have, but you might not need to purchase every component sepa-
rately to get a great-sounding system. Many of these components come
bundled together. For example, your Digidesign hardware will include at
least two preamps or you may find speakers that come with a power amp
inside them.

As you begin to build your home studio, you’ll notice a long list of 
components — okay, go ahead and call them “extras” — lurking within 
the Top Five of input devices, computer, interface, software, and monitors. 
In this section, I focus on these details of input devices so you can under-
stand just what roles they play in your system.
As you get more and more involved in recording, you’ll find you can add
almost any of these components to your existing system to expand and
enhance what you can do.
Interpreting input devices
All your expensive recording gear is useless if you have nothing to plug in to
it. This is where the input device comes into play. An input device is, simply,
any instrument, microphone, or sound module that produces or delivers a
sound to the recorder.
Instruments
An electric guitar, a bass, a synthesizer, and drum machines are typical
instruments that plug in to the interface and represent most of the input
devices that you use in your studio. A synthesizer and drum machine can
plug directly into the Line In inputs of your interface whereas an electric
guitar or a bass needs a direct box (or its equivalent) to plug into first. (In
the case of a Digidesign interface, you need to use one of the inputs with a
preamp.)
A direct box is an intermediary device that allows you to plug your guitar
directly into a mixer without going through your amp first. (For more on
direct boxes, see the upcoming section, “Deciphering direct boxes.”) Check
out Figure 1-1 for an example of an instrument input device.

Microphone
You use a microphone (mic) to record the sound of a voice or an acoustic
instrument — sound sources that, last time I checked, couldn’t be plugged
directly into the interface. A microphone converts sound waves into electri-
cal energy that can be understood by the interface. I detail the several types
of microphones in Book I, Chapter 5. Check out Figure 1-2 for a look at a
microphone.
Sound modules
Sound modules are special kinds of synthesizers and/or drum machines.
What makes a sound module different from a regular synthesizer or drum
machine is that these contain no triggers or keys that you can play. Instead,
sound modules are controlled externally by another synthesizer’s keyboard
or by a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller (a specialized

directly.

box designed to control MIDI instruments). Sound modules have MIDI ports
(MIDI jacks) to enable you to connect them to other equipment.
Often sound modules are rack mountable, meaning they have screw holes
and mounting ears so you can put them into an audio component rack. Some
controllers, however, are not rack mountable; Figure 1-3, for example, shows
a drum module that rests on a stand or tabletop.
Deciphering direct boxes
A direct box (or DI box, short for Direct Induction) is used to connect a
guitar or bass directly into the mixer without having to run it through an
amp first. A direct box’s purpose is twofold:
✦To change the guitar’s impedance level so that the mixer can create the
best sound possible
✦To change the nature of the connection from unbalanced (quarter-inch)
to balanced (XLR) so that you can use a long cord without creating noise
For more on cord types as well as balanced versus unbalanced signals,
see Book I, Chapter 2.
For most home recordists, the main purpose of a direct box is to act as an
impedance transformer. You’re unlikely to need a long run of cords from
your guitar to your mixer. Without a direct box changing your impedance
levels, your guitar signal might sound thin or have excess noise.

Perusing the preamp
Microphones produce a lower signal level than line-level devices (synthesiz-
ers, for example); thus, they need to have their signal level increased. For
this purpose, you need a preamp, a device that boosts a microphone’s
output. Preamps can be internal or external, meaning they could reside
within your mixer or be a separate unit that you plug in between your
microphone and mixer.
The preamp is one of the most crucial elements of a recording system
because using one can affect your instrument’s sound significantly. Most
professional recording studios have a variety of preamps to choose from,
and engineers use a particular preamp based upon the type of sound they’re
trying to capture.
The three basic types of preamps available are solid-state, tube, and hybrid.
(You can find out more about preamps in Book I, Chapter 5.)
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone or
instrument. Top-quality (expensive) solid-state preamps are generally
designed to produce a sound that’s clear and accurate (George Massenburg
Labs and Crane Song brands, for instance). Solid-state preamps can also be
designed to add a pleasing distortion to the music (Neve and Neve-clone
preamps, for example). Many recording professionals prefer the clear and
accurate sound of a solid-state preamp for acoustic or classical music or any
situation where capturing a very natural sound is important. The preamps in
your Digidesign interface are solid state. Although not as high of quality as
many of the more expensive external preamps, they are certainly serviceable
for most purposes and allow you to create top-quality music when you use
them correctly. (I show you how to do this in Book I, Chapter 5.)
Tube
Since the beginning of the digital recording revolution, professionals have
complained about the harshness of digital recording. As a result, many 
digital-recording pros prefer classic tube preamps because they can add
warmth to the recording. This warmth is actually distortion, albeit a pleasing
one. All-tube preamps are generally very expensive, but they are highly sought
after among digital recording aficionados because of their sound. Tube pre-
amps work well with music when you want to add color to the sound (that
is, not produce an accurate representation of the original source sound). No
wonder they show up a lot in rock and blues — and they’re great for record-
ing drums. You can also find tube preamps that are clean and open — much
like the high-end solid state preamps that I describe earlier — such as those
made by Manley Labs.

Meeting the Mixer
14
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components. Most of the
inexpensive tube preamps that you find in the marketplace are actually
hybrids. (These are also called starved-plate designs because the tubes don’t
run the same level of voltage as expensive tube designs.) These types of pre-
amps are usually designed to add the classic tube warmth to your instru-
ment’s sound. How much the sound is colored by the tubes and how pleasing
that colored sound is to the listener’s ears is dependent upon the quality of
the preamp. Most hybrid preamps allow you to dial in the amount of character
(pleasing distortion) that you want.
Your Digidesign interface will come with one (Mbox 2 Mini), two (Mbox 2 and
Mbox 2 Pro), or four (Digi 002, 003, 002 Rack, and 003 Rack) preamps. If you
want to plug in more mics than the number of preamps you have or if you
want to be able to produce different sounds from your preamps, you need to
buy one or more external preamps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-4.
Meeting the Mixer
A mixer is the heart of any recording system. Take a look at Figure 1-5.
Although a mixer might seem daunting with all its knobs, buttons, sliders,
and jacks, it’s really one of the most interesting and versatile pieces of equip-
ment that you’ll have in your studio. With a mixer, you can control the level
of the incoming signal, adjust the tonal quality of an instrument, blend the
signals of two or more instruments, and do a host of other things. And don’t
worry; after you read through this book, you’ll get the hang of all those
knobs in no time.
For the Pro Tools home recordist (that’s you), the mixer is incorporated into
your computer software. (Of course, you can always use an external hard-
ware mixer if you want.) The mixer in Pro Tools does the job well enough
that you don’t need an external mixer although some people prefer having
physical faders and knobs to mess with.
If you’re a knob-turner and like to physically touch the instrument you’re
playing (or, for that matter, the gadget you’re tweaking), consider choosing
the 003 instead of the other Digidesign interfaces. This unit has physical
faders that link perfectly with Pro Tools LE software.

Managing the MIDI Controller

If you already have one of the other Digidesign interfaces (such as the 
Mbox or 003 Rack) and you want physical faders, you might want to add a
Command|8 (as shown in Figure 1-6) whenever you have the cash. Third-
party control surfaces are available that are compatible with Pro Tools, such
as the Mackie Control Universal (by Mackie).
Managing the MIDI Controller
If you’re like most home recordists, you’ll end up using some sort of MIDI
controller in your studio. (See Book I, Chapter 4 for more about MIDI.) The
purpose of this piece of equipment is to allow the various MIDI instruments
to communicate and synchronize with one another.

MIDI is a protocol that musical instrument manufacturers (in a rare moment
of cooperation) developed to allow one digital instrument to communicate
with another. MIDI uses binary digital data, in the form of 1s and 0s, to tell an
instrument to play or release a note, to change sounds, and send a host of
other messages. (Discover more about MIDI in Book I, Chapter 4.)
MIDI controllers come in many shapes and sizes. The most common are
computer software, keyboard, or standalone controllers. These controllers
can reside within the computer (Pro Tools, for example, has MIDI capabili-
ties), a keyboard (synthesizer), or a separate box. They enable you to either
play, in real time, another instrument or to trigger another instrument with
the sequencer, which is a MIDI program that allows you to play an instrument
without actually playing (like a player piano). They just need to have MIDI
capability and be connected through their MIDI ports (using MIDI cables).
Pro Tools software has fine MIDI capabilities, so you don’t need to buy a sep-
arate MIDI controller. I recommend that you use the MIDI functions in Pro
Tools before deciding to invest in another MIDI controller. I think you’ll be
pleased with what you can do with Pro Tools.
Recognizing the Recorder
The recorder is where your music actually gets, well, recorded. In Pro Tools,
your recorder consists of your computer and the software. Sound becomes
data and is stored as digital information, as 1s and 0s. Digital recording

introduces very little noise into the final sound and can be copied without
any loss in that sound quality, depending on the bit depth and sample rate at
which you record, of course.
Digital recorders
A digital recorder is included as part of your Pro Tools setup. Digital
recorders use two terms to describe the overall quality of the sound that
they produce — sampling rate and bit depth.
Sampling rate
Sampling rate refers to the frequency at which the recorder samples the
incoming sound source. When a recorder samples a sound, it actually takes a
small snapshot of the audio signal. Typical sample rates for digital recorders
are 44.1 kHz (the sample rate for audio CDs), 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz
(the sampling rate for DVD audio). The higher the number, the more samples
are taken each second, and the closer the recorded sound is to the original.
The more times per second that a digital recorder samples the sound of the
incoming signal, the more of the original sound it includes (which results in,
among other things, a bigger sound file that takes up more space on your
computer). These numbers are described in kHz (kilohertz) — that is, as
taking place thousands of times per second. For example, when you record
at 48 kHz, the sound is sampled 48,000 times every second. This sounds like
an awful lot, but accurate sound requires lots of samples.
Bit depth
When you start looking at digital recorders, you’ll hear jargon such as 16-bit
(the bit depth of audio CDs), 20-bit, 24-bit, and so forth. This is the bit depth,
which is described in terms of bits. (A bit, short for BInary digiT, is the basic
unit of information in the binary numbering system used by computers.) The
numbers 16, 20, and 24 relate to the amount of digital information that can
be contained in each of those sample rates that I describe in the previous
section, “Sampling rate.” The higher the number, the more accurately the
sound is represented; most professional audio gear now records at a 24-bit
resolution. With that higher number, however, the sound takes up more of
your digital storage space. This usually isn’t a big deal, though, considering
the low cost of huge hard drives.
A/D and D/A converters
A third variable that affects how good a digital recorder will sound is the
type of analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters that the
recorder uses. The A/D and D/A converters are what actually transform an
analog sound source into digital information and back again. They do this by

Recognizing the Recorder
18
taking small snapshots of the incoming signal (at whatever sampling rate the
converter uses) and applying a number to that sample (based upon the bit
depth).
For example, suppose that you have a 24-bit converter with a 48 kHz sam-
pling rate. When it senses an auditory signal — a vocal perhaps — the 
A/D converter takes a snapshot (measurement) of that signal 48,000 times
per second (48 kHz). Each of these snapshots is given a value between
–8,395,008 and +8,395,008 (24-bit resolution has 16,790,016 possible levels),
which puts the vocal sound somewhere on a chart corresponding to a
waveform shape. The recorder in turn reads these numbers, and the D/A
converter translates these numbers back into an analog waveform again.
(Pshew!)
Converting an analog signal into digital data and back again is a highly tech-
nical process. You could spend days or even weeks reading about the intrica-
cies of audio conversion. (Check out Principles of Digital Audio by Ken C.
Pohlmann, published by McGraw-Hill Professional; or The Art of Digital Audio
by John Watkinson, published by Focal Press, if you’re into this techy stuff.)
The most important thing to remember when considering A/D and D/A con-
verters is how well you like the sound. If the converter sounds good to you,
it’s a good converter.
You can buy separate A/D and D/A converters that can sound better than the
one included in your Digidesign hardware. Depending on your ears, your
engineering skills, and the style of your music, the improvement in sound
of external converters can range from barely noticeable to mind-blowing.
Before you spend any money on external converters, though, I highly recom-
mend working on your skills as a songwriter, a musician, and an engineer.
The computer
No matter which platform of computer you choose (Mac or PC), the stuff
you find inside your computer plays a major role in determining how
smoothly (or how less than smoothly) your Pro Tools system runs. (Book II,
Chapter 1 details the best computer setups and needed specs for Pro Tools.)
To set up a Pro Tools computer, you need several things:
✦A computer (preferably with a speedy processor)
✦Bunches (BIG bunches) of memory
✦Dual hard drives
✦An audio interface
This is the Digidesign hardware that you use with Pro Tools LE software
or the M-Audio hardware you use with Pro Tools M-Powered edition.
✦The software (Pro Tools, of course)

If you can afford it, get a dedicated computer — one specifically for record-
ing audio — because running other types of applications (home finance,
word processors, or video games) can cause problems with your audio
applications and reduce the stability of your system.
The following list clues you in on the various pieces of hardware that you
find in your computer:
✦The CPU: The CPU (processor) is the heart of your computer studio. The
speed of your CPU ultimately dictates just how well any program runs
on it. As a general rule, for audio, get the fastest processor that you can
afford. For most audio software, you need at least a Pentium IV for the
PC or a G4 for Mac.
Because computer hardware is always changing and nearly unlimited
options are available for the different components you find on a com-
puter (especially on a PC), I strongly recommend that you consult the
Digidesign compatibility pages at its Web site before you buy a com-
puter. Or, if you already have a computer, first check whether it’s 
compatible:
a. Find compatibility information at
www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?nevid=3&langid=100&
b. Choose your version of Pro Tools and hardware or OS type from the
drop-down menus.
If you own a PC and have no idea what’s in it, use PC Wizard to find out
what you have and compare it against the requirements for running Pro
Tools. You can download PC Wizard by going to www.cpuid.org/pc
wizard.php.
✦Memory: Computer-based audio programs and all their associated plug-
ins are RAM (random access memory) hogs. My advice: Get a lot of
RAM. Okay, that’s not very specific, but how much you really need
depends on your recording style. If you do a lot of audio tracks and want
reverb or some effect on each track, you need more RAM (and a faster
processor).
Pro Tools recommends a minimum of 768MB of RAM for basic operation,
but you should really get a lot more, especially if you’re using the DV
Toolkit or Music Production Toolkit options available for your system. In
this case Digidesign recommends at least 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM or PC
users and 1.5GB of RAM or Mac users.
Regardless of the platform you choose (PC or Mac), keep in mind that
you can never have too fast of a processor or too much memory.
✦The hard drives: To record audio, be sure you get the right types of
hard drives. Notice how I said hard drives (plural). Yep, you should get
more than one if you want to record more than a few tracks of audio.

Recognizing the Recorder
20
You want one hard drive to hold all the software and the operating
system and the second drive just for audio data. Having two drives
greatly increases the likelihood that your system remains stable and
doesn’t crash on you, especially if you try to run 16 or more tracks.
Choose your hard drives wisely. For the software hard drive, you can get
away with a stock drive (usually the one that comes with your com-
puter). For the audio, though, you need a drive that can handle the
demands of transferring audio data at high speed. The main things you
want to look for are spindle speed, seek time, and buffer size:
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at which
the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200 rpm drive will work
well for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time the drive takes to find the 
data stored on it. You want an average seek time under 10 milli-
seconds (ms).
• Buffer size: Often called cache buffers, these memory units store data
while it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at least 2MB.
As for the size of the hard drive — again, bigger is better, at least in the
audio drive where you store your music. For the core system drive, you
can get by with a 60GB drive; for the audio, 120GB is still pretty conser-
vative because audio data can take up a ton of space. For example, a 
5-minute song with 16 tracks recorded at a 24-bit resolution and 44.1 kHz
bandwidth takes up about 600MB of hard drive space (about 7.5MB per
track minute). Recording at 96 kHz bandwidth takes up about 20MB per
track minute.
The track count that your system can handle is directly related to the speed
of your hard drive: The faster the drive, the more tracks you can record and
play back at once. (Of course, the type of drive you get determines how large
a role your processor plays.) My current choice for a drive is a Maxtor 7200
rpm ATA IDE drive with an 8.5 ms seek time and an 8MB cache buffer.
You can use internal IDE/ATA and SATA drives as well as external FireWire or
FireWire 800 drives for recording audio with Pro Tools. However, you cannot
use USB 2.0 drives: For some reason, they are slower than FireWire drives in
real-world testing.
Getting the sound in and out
After you have a computer with enough speed and muscle (see the earlier
section, “The computer”), you need the appropriate hardware to get the
sound in and out of it. Traditionally (if there can be traditions in such a new
technology), you needed a sound card — also called a PCI card because it
fits in the PCI (Peripheral Component Interface) slot in your computer. You
also needed an audio interface, which allowed you to get the sound from
your mixer or preamp to the sound card. This is not the case anymore.

Book I
Chapter 1
Discovering What
You Need
Recognizing the Recorder
21
Currently, audio can be brought in and out of a computer in several ways:
✦Through a PCI card connected to your computer’s PCI slot: None of
current the Digidesign interfaces use a PCI card. However, several of the
M-Audio interfaces (if you’re using the M-Powered version of Pro Tools
software) use PCI cards to connect with your computer. These use a
sound card that installs in your computer and might or might not have a
separate box that houses the converters, inputs, and outputs.
✦Through an interface connected to the USB port: The Mbox 2k, Mbox 2
Mini, and Mbox 2 Micro have USB connectivity. This interface works
great; the only problem is that you’re limited to two inputs and two out-
puts because of the relatively slow data transfer speed of USB ports. If
you don’t see yourself needing to record more than two tracks at once,
this might be a good option for you.
✦Through your FireWire port: The Mbox Pro, Digi 003, and the Digi 003
Rack connect to your computer through a FireWire port. FireWire is
preferable to USB because the transfer speed is fast enough to keep
latency (the delay from the audio going in and coming back out of your
computer) to a minimum. FireWire ports are inexpensive and available
on laptop computers as well as desktop systems, which makes FireWire
interfaces more versatile than PCI-based systems.
Each of the Digidesign and many of the M-Audio interfaces are described in
detail in Book II, Chapter 2.
Software
If you’re using a Digidesign interface, you’ll also be using Pro Tools LE soft-
ware; if you’re using M-Audio hardware, you’ll be using the Pro Tools M-
Powered version. Down the road, however, you might want to add some
other software to your system. This can include programs such as Acid (for
creating loops) or Logic (for more MIDI-intensive work).
On the Internet, you can find an online discussion board for each of the
major audio-recording software programs. Before you buy, go to the sites of
the systems that interest you and see what people say about the programs.
Ask questions, explore the issues that the people are having with the 
programs, and look for comments that reflect how well the programs inter-
act with Pro Tools and your Digidesign hardware. Doing so can save you lots
of time dealing with bugs in your system, allowing you to record a lot more
music. You can find these sites by using the product name as the keyword in
your favorite search engine or by checking out these Internet forums:

Part of the recording process involves making adjustments to a sound before
or after it’s been recorded. This is the job of the signal processor, which
comes in three varieties — equalizers, dynamic processors, and effects
processors. They can be incorporated into the system or be separate, stand-
alone units. For most Pro Tools users, the signal processors of choice are
integrated into the software as plug-ins, although you can also use external
processors by sending the audio out of your computer and back in again.
Equalizers (EQ)
Equalizers enable you to adjust the frequencies of a sound in a variety of
ways. In effect, you tell the frequencies to
✦Go away. You can get rid of unwanted noise or an annoying ringing by
reducing select frequencies.
✦Come hither. Add life or presence to an instrument by bringing the best
characteristics of that instrument forward.
✦Scoot over. You can make room within the frequency spectrum for each
of the instruments in your mix by selectively boosting or cutting certain
frequencies.
You can find out more about EQ (and discover some great EQ tips and
tricks) in Book VI, Chapter 3. The three main types of EQ are graphic, shelf,
and parametric. The following sections give you the rundown.
Graphic EQ
Use graphic equalizers to choose a specific frequency to increase or decrease
by a certain amount, generally up to 6 or 12 decibels (dB). Doing so enables
you to eliminate an offending frequency from the signal or make other
adjustments to the tonal quality of the source signal. The graphic EQ has a
certain number of frequency bands that you can adjust. You’re limited to
only those frequency bands that your EQ has available. Figure 1-7 shows a
typical graphic EQ.

Book I

23
Shelf EQ
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above or below the target fre-
quency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the top or bottom end of the
frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a shelf EQ to roll off the fre-
quencies below 250 hertz (Hz) in order to reduce the amount of rumble (low-
frequency noise) in a recording. You can see how this looks in Figure 1-8.
Notice how the shelf EQ gradually reduces the amount of energy (sound)
below the set point and then levels off: hence, the shelf in its name.
Parametric EQ
The parametric equalizer enables you to choose the specific frequency that
you want to affect as well as the range of frequencies to put around that fre-
quency. With a parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency that you want to
change, and then you set the range (referred to as the Q) — that is, the
number of octaves that the EQ will affect. Check out Figure 1-9: The two dia-
grams show how the Q relates to the range of frequencies affected. (The
higher the Q setting, the narrower the band of frequencies affected.)
The parametric EQ is one of your most useful tools when mixing all your
individual tracks into a stereo pair. I describe this tool in detail in Book VI,
Chapter 3.

Dynamic processors
Dynamic processors regulate the amount of sound or energy that gets passed
through them. This amount is defined as the dynamic range — the range
between the softest sound and the loudest sound. Dynamic processors come
in three varieties: compressors/limiters, gates, and expanders. I explain each
variety in the following sections.
Dynamic processors are used in a variety of ways. Use them to

✦Tame the levels and correct the effects of an erratic musical perform-
ance when mixing.
✦Optimize the levels of the finished stereo tracks when mastering.
Dynamic processors are some of the most useful tools that you have in your
home studio. See Book VI, Chapter 4 for more on dynamic processors.
Compressors/limiters
A compressor’s job is to compress the dynamic range of the sound being
affected. The purpose of the compressor is to eliminate transients (unusually
loud notes) that can create clipping (digital distortion). The compressor

limits not only how loud a note can be, but it also reduces the difference
between the loudest and softest note (compressing the dynamic range).
Compressors are used extensively on vocals; the device keeps transients at
bay by gently reducing the highest level that goes through it. Compressors
are also used in mastering to raise the overall volume of a song without cre-
ating distortion. The device does this by reducing the overall dynamic range;
as a result, a compressor effectively raises the volume of the softer notes
without allowing the louder notes to be too loud and distorting.
A limiter works much like the compressor except that it severely limits the
highest level of a sound source. The limiter is basically a compressor on
steroids; it gives you beefed-up control over volume. Any signal above a cer-
tain level, called the threshold, gets chopped off instead of compressed (like
with the compressor). A limiter is a good choice in extreme situations, such
as when you want a really in-your-face snare drum sound. In this instance,
the limiter essentially eliminates any dynamic variation from the drummer’s
snare drum hits and makes them all as loud as possible.
Gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter. Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out any
sound below a certain setting (the threshold) while allowing any note above
that threshold to be heard.
Gates are often used on drums to keep unwanted sounds from the cymbals
from bleeding through to the tom-tom or snare drum mics, or on guitars by
refusing to allow the noise generated by guitar effects to be heard when the
instrument isn’t playing.
Expander
An expander is basically the opposite of a compressor — instead of attenuat-
ing (reducing the volume of) the loudest notes in a performance, an expander
attenuates the softest notes. For example, if you have a singer whose breath
you can hear in the mic and you want to get rid of that particular blemish,
just set the expander to go on at a level just above the annoying breath
sounds to subtly drop the offending noise.
Effects processors
Effects are historically used to mimic real-world situations. As a home
recordist, you will likely discover a great affinity toward your effects proces-
sors because they enable you to create sonic environments without having
to rent some great recording room. For example, imagine dragging your
drums and all your recording equipment into a large cathedral, setting them
up, and spending several hours getting the mics placed just right. Sounds

like a lot of work, right? (I’m tired just thinking about it.) Well, how about
recording your drums in your modest home studio and simply choosing the
“cathedral hall reverb” patch instead? Now that’s much easier.
I can practically guarantee that you will use effects processors all the time in
your studio. Scope out Book VI, Chapter 5 for how to use them effectively.
In the world of effects processors, you have many choices, and many more
show up every year. The most common effects processors are (in no particu-
lar order) reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, and pitch correction. Read on for
the lowdown on each type.
Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. With
reverb, you can make any instrument sound as if it were recorded in almost
any environment. Reverb, a natural part of every sound, is the result of the
sound bouncing around inside a room. The larger the room, the more pro-
nounced the reverb. The purpose of a reverb in audio production is to make
an instrument sound more natural (especially because most instruments are
recorded in small, nonreverberant rooms) or to add a special effect. Reverb
can make almost any recorded instrument sound better — if used correctly.
Delay
Think of delays as a recording studio’s version of an echo. The delay can be
set to happen immediately after the original sound or be delayed much
longer. Delay can sound natural or be used as a spacey special effect. You
can have a single echo or multiple delays (very common with the snare
drum in reggae music, for instance). Delays are commonly used on vocals
and guitar although you can hear them on just about any instrument,
depending on the style of music.
Chorus
A chorus effect can make one instrument sound like several. Chorus effects
add very slightly off-tune versions of the unaffected sound, which results in
a fuller sound. You find chorus effects used on vocals, guitars, and lots of
other melodic instruments.
Flanger
A flanger (pronounced flanj-er) effect is similar to chorus effect in sound
except that the flanger gets its sound from delaying part of the affected
sound in relation to the original, rather than altering its pitch. Flangers are
sometimes used on background vocals and solo instruments to add an inter-
esting texture. This is a unique sound that you recognize almost immediately
upon hearing it.

Book I
Chapter 1
Discovering What
You Need
Making Sense of Monitors
27
The flanger effect comes from the early days in recording. You create the
flanger effect the old-fashioned way by recording a duplicate track of the one
that you want to flange, using a two-track recorder. You then play the two
identical parts back at the same time and gently press against the edge of
the two-track tape (the one with the duplicate part) while it’s running. This
delays certain parts of the sound slightly and drastically changes the charac-
ter of the instrument.
Nowadays, you can just choose the flanger patch (sound) on your effects
processor to get this sound. Isn’t technology great?
Pitch correction
Pitch correction, like its name suggests, is used to correct an out-of-tune note.
You can use this effect to help a singer or an instrument player sound better
by fixing those notes that are slightly out of tune. Pitch correction (also
called auto-tune) has gotten a bad rap lately (mainly from its overuse and
potential for abuse with a singer who can’t sing in key). When used sparingly
and appropriately, pitch correction can make an otherwise decent vocal per-
formance really shine. Auto-tune can also be used to create some interesting
effects, such as that robotic-vocal sound you hear on so many of the pop
songs on the radio nowadays. The most easily distinguished example is the
lead vocal on Cher’s “Believe.”
Making Sense of Monitors
To record and mix music, you need to be able to hear it. (Hey, obvious things
need love, too.) Monitors make this happen. You can use headphones or
speakers as monitors; most home studios use both. Monitors are an essen-
tial part of a recording studio because you need to get what you’re recording
and mixing into your ears before you make sure that it sounds good.
Without good speakers, you won’t know what your mixes are going to sound
like on other speakers. (Find out more about mixing in Book VI.)
Headphones
Chances are that your first home studio will be in a spare bedroom or a
corner of your garage or basement. All your recording, monitoring, and
mixing will be done here. If that’s the case, a set of headphones is indispen-
sable because you can turn off your speakers and still hear what’s being (or
was) recorded. When you go to record a guitar using a microphone in front
of the guitar amp, you want to hear only the guitar — not the guitar amp and
the guitar amp coming back through your monitors. Headphones allow you
to do this. (See Figure 1-10.)

Making Sense of Monitors
28
Speakers
For most home recordists, your first set of monitors consists of the home
stereo system. Sooner or later, though, you’re gonna want a real set of moni-
tors. Studio monitors come in many varieties, but the home recordist’s best
bet is a set of near-field monitors. Near-field monitors are designed to be posi-
tioned close to you (which is often the case anyway because most home
recordists have very little room in which to work).
Near-field monitors come with or without an amplifier. The amplified moni-
tors are active monitors, and the nonamplified monitors are passive monitors.
Which type of monitor you choose depends on your budget and whether
you like the idea of the amp coming with the speakers or you prefer to pur-
chase the amp separately. Figure 1-11 shows an active, near-field monitor.
The amplifier is located inside the speaker cabinet.

If you end up getting passive monitors, you need to buy an amplifier to send
power to the speakers. The amplifier connects to the outputs of the mixer
and boosts the signal to the speakers. A good power amp should be matched
in power to work well with whatever speakers you have.
Mastering Media
After you mix your music, you need to save your final music on some kind of
media. The two most common mediums for Pro Tools users are CD and raw
computer files. Which medium you choose depends upon what your goals
are. For instance, if you intend to send your finished mix to a mastering house,
you’re better off saving it as raw audio data in a computer file. On the other
hand, if you master your music yourself and just want to have it duplicated
(or you want to give copies for your friends to play), you want to use a CD.

CD
With the cost of CD-R (write) and CD-RW (rewrite) drives plummeting, CD
mastering is the only choice for most home recordists. With CDs, you can
back up large amounts of data at a very low cost, and you can burn audio
CDs that can play in any CD player. You can even send out your mastered CD
to be duplicated and packaged for retail sale. (Book VIII, Chapter 1 details
the process for burning CDs and how to have mass quantities created.)
Computer files
Sometimes you won’t want to master your music directly to CD. You might
decide to have a professional mastering house do it, or maybe you want to
put your music on the Internet. In those situations, store your recordings as
computer files. The following sections describe the most commonly used file
formats for storing recorded music.
WAV and AIFF
WAV (Microsoft Wave format) and AIFF (Apple; Audio Interchange File
Format) files are the formats for audio files found with most professional
audio software. The advantage to saving your music to WAV or AIFF is that
when you hand over a CD containing your WAV and/or AIFF files to a master-
ing house, the recorded sound is actually in a higher-quality format than that
of the finished CD (provided that your recorder records in 20 or 24 bit,
which most do). You can also take your music files to any other studio that
supports these file formats and work with them there.
MIDI
A MIDI file is not an audio file; rather, it’s a data file that contains MIDI infor-
mation that can be transferred from one computer to another. An advantage
to MIDI files is that they take up less room than an audio file. The disadvan-
tage is that they contain only the MIDI information and no sound. To play a
MIDI file, you have to have a sound module. And the sound you get from the
file depends entirely on what sound source you use.
MP3
MP3 is a file format that has become quite popular on the Internet. Its advan-
tage over audio CDs and other computer files is that it takes up less room.
Its disadvantage is that the data is compressed and the sound quality is not
near that of commercial CDs (contrary to what MP3 proponents claim). You
can find out more about MP3s and audio quality in Book VIII, Chapter 2.

O
kay, so you’re ready to turn that spare bedroom or basement into a
recording studio. After you unpack all your shiny new gear and get it
plugged in properly, you need to get your room to work for you. This
involves creating an efficient place to work, but above all, it means getting
your room to sound good. This can be tricky; after all, pro studios spend
tons of time and money getting the room to sound great. You’re going to
have to do much the same. You may not have to spend a ton of money (as if
any of us could), but you will need to spend some time.
After you decide on a space for your home recording system, the next steps
involve setting up the system and getting your space to work for you. In 
this chapter, I help you make sense of all those connectors that you end up
using — and help you get them all plugged in properly. I also show you how
to find the best way to work in your environment, with a goodly measure of
tips and tricks thrown in to make your room sound as good as possible.
Making Connections
No matter what type of home recording equipment you have, one thing’s for
sure — you’re gonna have to plug in some cords somewhere. Exactly where
depends on the particular system you own, so read through this section to
make sense of all those different cords and connectors, whether analog or
digital.
You probably have a lot of experience with analog connectors and cords,
such as the ones on your stereo system. You might never have come in con-
tact with digital connectors, though, unless you’ve plugged in a DVD player
to your TV or had a chance to go into a recording studio that uses digital
gear. If you’ve already had this foretaste, pay particular attention to the
“Digital” section of this chapter.

Making Connections

Analog
No doubt you’ve had a chance to see and use a variety of analog connectors.
If you play a guitar or keyboard (synthesizer), for example, you’re familiar
with a quarter-inch analog plug. Some microphones use an XLR analog plug.
Keeping it all straight can be a little confusing: Why do you have to use one
plug for one thing and another for something else? And what’s a TRS plug,
anyway?
Read on to decipher the secrets of the most-common analog connectors:
✦Quarter-inch
• Mono/TS
• Stereo/TRS
✦XLR
✦RCA
Quarter-inch analog plugs
A quarter-inch plug is the most common audio connector and one of the most
versatile as well: You see it on cables strung all over the studio to connect
instruments, amps, speakers, headphones, and mixers. Quarter-inch plugs
come in two varieties: mono/TS or stereo/TRS.
Mono/TS plugs
The humble plug at the end of the cord you use for your guitar or synthe-
sizer is an example of a mono quarter-inch plug; mono (monaural) means it
has only one channel with which to send the signal. This type of plug is also
referred to as a TS plug (short for Tip/Sleeve): The tip is the very tip of the
plug, and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part. A plastic divider
separates the two sections, each of which is connected to a different part of
the cable. Check out Figure 2-1 to see this familiar plug.
TS plugs are used for a variety of purposes: to go from your guitar to your
guitar amp, from your synthesizer to your mixer, from your mixer to your
power amplifier (amp), and from your power amp to your speakers. You’d
expect that one cord could work for all of these applications. After all, a TS

plug is a TS plug is a TS plug, right? Well, not really. The same plug can be
wired differently, and it can carry different levels of power. For example, an
instrument cord (the one you use for your synthesizer or guitar) contains
one wire and a shield: The wire is connected to the tip, and the shield is con-
nected to the sleeve. Comparatively, a speaker cord contains two wires and
no shield: One wire is connected to the tip and the other to the sleeve.
The speaker cord also carries a lot more current (power) than the instru-
ment cable; that’s why it doesn’t have a shield. The high signal level covers
up any noise present in the cord. Because there isn’t nearly as much current
present in an instrument, you don’t want to use a speaker cord for your
instrument; instead, you need the instrument cable’s shield to keep down
the noise. If you do use a speaker cord for your instrument, you might end
up with some noise — a hiss, buzz, or even a radio broadcast coming out of
your amp (or wherever you plugged in your instrument).
When you buy cords with TS plugs, first be sure to look at (or ask) what pur-
pose the cord is designed for. Then, when you get it home, be sure to make a
note of what type of cord it is so that you use it correctly. You can mark your
cord a number of ways: You can put colored tape on it (red for speaker or
blue for instrument, for example), put a tag or label on it, or (gasp) dot it
with nail polish.
You generally don’t need to worry about which end of the cord you plug into
your instrument because the signal travels equally well in either direction.
However, currently (so to speak), you can buy cords that are designed to
send the current in one direction. (The cord has an arrow on it designating
which direction the signal should flow.) I call these designer cords, and two of
the most common brands are Monster and Planet Waves. The theory behind
these cords is that they do a better job of preserving the sound qualities of
the instrument for which they’re designed. These cords are specifically
designed for almost every instrument and application known to humankind.
Instrument cords are often called unbalanced lines because of how they’re
wired. An unbalanced cord has one wire surrounded by a braided shield; the
wire is connected to the tip of the TS plug and the shield is connected to the
sleeve. The signal is sent through the wire, and the shield is used for the
ground. (It keeps down the noise.) Balanced lines are also available, which I
explain in the following section on stereo/TRS plugs.
Stereo/TRS plugs
A stereo/TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve) quarter-inch plug looks like a stereo head-
phone plug. (Take a look at Figure 2-2.) The tip is at the very end of the plug,
the ring is the small middle section located between the two plastic dividers,
and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part of the plug. A TRS plug
can be used a couple of ways: as a balanced cord or with a Y cord. Read on
to find out what these terms mean.

Making Connections
34
✦A balanced cord is used on professional audio gear to connect the vari-
ous pieces of equipment: the mixer to the recorder, for example. The
advantage with a balanced cord is that you can have longer cord runs
without creating noise.
✦A Y cord consists of a TRS plug on one end and two TS plugs on the
other, forming (you guessed it) a nice representation of the letter Y. The
purpose of this cord is to allow you to insert an effects processor — a
compressor or an equalizer, for example — into the Line In insert jack of
a mixer. Check out Chapter 3 of this mini-book for all the details.
The TRS plug both sends and receives a signal. The Y cord is wired so
that the tip sends the signal and the ring receives it (see Figure 2-3). The
sleeve is connected to the shield of each cable.
Figure 2-2:
Use a
balanced
(TRS) plug
to connect
professional
audio gear.
Keeping your balance
Why is it that balanced cords are so conve-
niently noise-free? The balanced cord — with
two wires and a shield inside — is wired with
the same signal running through both wires.
One is 180 degrees out of phase with the other
(their wave forms are exactly opposite one
another) so that the crest of one wave occurs
at exactly the same time as the trough of the
other, canceling out each other. When they get
to the mixer (or wherever they’re plugged in to),
one of the signals is instantly flipped and added
to the other. Any noise that was built up in the
signal is cancelled out. (Yep, it’s wave cancel-
lation from high-school physics. Who knew it
also rocks?)

XLR connectors
An XLR connector is used for microphones and some line connections
between professional gear. This cable has a female and a male end. (See
Figure 2-4.) The cord is wired much like a TRS connector and is balanced to
keep the noise down. The XLR microphone cable is also called a low-Z cable
because it carries a low-impedance signal.

RCA plugs
RCA plugs — named for good ol’ RCA; also called phono plugs — are common
on home stereo (and some semi-pro) audio gear. (See Figure 2-5.) They func-
tion much like a TS plug and aren’t very common in professional audio
equipment. Some mixers include them, however, so you can connect a tape
deck. They are also used for digital S/PDIF signals. (See the upcoming sec-
tion, “S/PDIF connectors,” for more on these babies.)
Digital
Because you’re using Pro Tools and your computer, you’re going to get com-
fortable with digital connectors. Digital audio equipment is a recent inven-
tion: No one standard has emerged. Because of this lack of standardization, a
variety of digital connectors are on the market, only a few (or one) of which
might be equipment that you own or intend to purchase. Regardless, know-
ing about the most common connectors and their purposes will help you
decide what equipment is right for you.
MIDI connectors
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a handy communication proto-
col that allows musical information to pass from one device to another. To
allow for the free passage of such information, MIDI jacks are located on a
whole host of electronic instruments — synthesizers, drum machines, sound
modules, and even some guitars. To connect all these instruments, you need
MIDI cables. The MIDI cable contains five pins (male) that plug into the
female MIDI jack (port) on the instrument or device. (See Figure 2-6.)

The Mbox 2, Mbox 2 Pro, Digi 003, and 003 Rack audio interfaces each have
MIDI ports, but the Mbox 2 Mini does not. Some M-Audio interfaces come
with MIDI ports, but others don’t. Check out Book II, Chapter 2 for an
overview of many of the M-Audio interfaces and whether they have MIDI
ports. If you want to use MIDI and you have an Mbox 2 Mini or one of the M-
Audio interfaces without MIDI ports, you need to buy a separate MIDI inter-
face. Regardless of which Digidesign interface you have, you need to buy the
cable for those ports separately.
AES/EBU connectors
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcasting Union) cables
are much like S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format, which I talk
about next). The AES/EBU standards require that these cables transmit two
channels of data at a time. They differ from S/PDFIF connectors in that they
consist of XLR plugs and use balanced cables. (See Figure 2-7.) AES/EBU was
developed to be used with professional audio components: hence, the use of
balanced connections (the kinds used in professional-level equipment). Your
Pro Tools interface doesn’t have any AES/EBU connectors; S/PDIF and ADAT
Optical are used instead. (See the following sections.)
S/PDIF connectors
S/PDIF connectors consist of an unbalanced coaxial cable (one wire and a
shield) and RCA plugs. (See Figure 2-7.) They can also be made from fiber
optic cable and a Toslink connector. The S/PDIF format can transmit two
channels of digital data at once. S/PDIF protocols are very similar to AES/
EBU standards except that S/PDIF was originally designed for the consumer
market, which explains why unbalanced cords are used. Even so, you can
find S/PDIF connectors on a lot of pro recording gear along with (or instead
of) AES/EBU.

If you want to use cords longer than about 3 or 4 feet when you’re using an
S/PDIF connection — or about 15 feet for AES/EBU connections — your best
bet is to use video or digital audio cables. Regular audio cables degrade the
sound at longer distances because they can’t transmit the type of signal that
digital equipment produces without affecting the quality of the sound. If you
use audio cables for longer distances, the sound loses some definition,
becoming what some people describe as “grainy.”
ADAT Optical
The ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) Optical (Lightpipe) format can send
eight tracks of digital audio at once. Developed by Alesis, ADAT Optical has
become a standard among digital audio products. It consists of a fiber optic
cable, using a special connector developed by Alesis. In your Digidesign
interface, you can use ADAT Optical for either eight channels of ADAT infor-
mation or for Optical S/PDIF connections; however, you can use only one or
the other at one time. You choose your preference from the Hardware Setup
screen under the Setup menu.
TDIF connectors
TDIF (Teac Digital Interface Format) is Teac’s return volley to ADAT Lightpipe.
TDIF uses a standard computer cable with a 25-pin connector. Like the ADAT
Lightpipe, TDIF cables can transmit eight channels of digital data at a time.
TDIF isn’t nearly as common as ADAT Lightpipe because Alesis made its
Lightpipe technology available to other companies to use for free (and
encouraged them to adopt it as a standard) and also because the Alesis
ADAT recorders were so common. You won’t find any TDIF connections in
your Digidesign hardware — ADAT is used instead.

Working Efficiently in Your Studio
I hope you spend a great number of hours in your studio creating some great
music (albeit possibly to the dismay of the rest of your family). Start by
designing your studio layout for comfort and productivity. Then, consider
how to protect your equipment and also effectively place your audio 
monitors.
Setting up your studio for comfort and efficiency
One important thing to keep in mind is that you need to be comfortable.
Start with a good chair. Then set up your workstation to be as easy to get
around as possible. Figure 2-8 shows a classic L setup. Notice how every-
thing that you need is within arm’s reach.
If you have enough room, you might want to consider a U-shaped setup
instead. You can see an example of that in Figure 2-9. If you don’t have an
external mixer/recorder, it’s often best to put the computer in the middle
position.
If you use a lot of outboard gear — such as preamps or effects processors —
and you think that you need to plug and unplug a lot, invest in a good patch
bay so that you don’t have to strain to get at your cords tucked away behind
your mixer. A patch bay is a device that consists almost entirely of inputs
and outputs, allowing you to route your gear in (and out) in an almost-
infinite variety of ways. If you’re going to do much plugging and unplugging,
you’ll quickly find out that a patch bay is truly indispensable.
Using a patch bay will not only save your back but will also save your cords
because repeated plugging and unplugging wears them out quickly and pro-
duces buzzes that can be hard to locate.
Taming heat and dust
The number-one enemy of electronic equipment is heat. Dust is a close
second. Try to set up your studio in a room that you can keep cool and fairly
dust-free. Air conditioning is a must for most studios. Be careful with a
window air conditioner, though, because it can make a lot of noise, requiring
you to shut it off when you record. Depending on where you live, this could
let your room heat up really fast. To deal with dust, try to cover up your
equipment when you’re not using it, especially your microphones. A plastic
bag placed over the top of a mic on a stand works well.
You could also just put your mics away when you’re not using them.
However, if you use a particular mic a lot, you’re best off leaving it on a stand
rather than handling it because some types of mics are pretty fragile. (You
can find more on caring for your mics in Book I, Chapter 5.)

Working Efficiently in Your Studio

Monitoring your monitors
If you have a set of near-field monitors — the kind that are designed to be
placed close to you — they should be set up so they’re equidistant from
each other and from you, at a height that puts them level with your ears.
Figure 2-10 illustrates the best placement for your monitors. Placing your
monitors this way ensures that you hear the best possible sound from them
and can accurately hear the stereo field. (For more on the stereo field, see
Book VI, Chapter 1.)

Optimizing Your Studio
Chances are that your studio occupies a corner in your living room, a spare
bedroom, or a section of your basement or garage. All these spaces are less-
than-ideal recording environments. Even if you intend to record mostly by
plugging your instrument or sound module directly into the mixer, how your
room sounds will have a big effect on how good your music will turn out to be.
Face it: As a home recordist, you’re unlikely to have easy access to the
resources that create a top-notch sound room. Commercial studios spend
serious cash — up to seven figures — to make their rooms sound, well, pro-
fessional. However, you don’t need to spend near that amount of money (you
mean you don’t want to sell off the private jet . . .?) to get great sounding
recordings. All it takes is a little understanding of how sound travels, some
ingenuity, and a little bit of work.

Sound isolation
One of the concerns that you (and your neighbors) are probably going to
have when you start recording in your home is the amount of sound that
gets in and out of your room. Sound waves are nasty little buggers. They get
through almost any surface, and there’s not a lot you can do to stop it from
happening.
You’ve probably noticed this phenomenon when somebody with a massive
subwoofer in his car drives by blasting some obnoxious music. (Ever notice
how someone else’s music is obnoxious, whereas your music never is, no
matter how loud you play it? Amazing . . . ) Your windows rattle, your walls
shake, and your favorite mug flies off the shelf and breaks into a thousand
pieces. Well, this is one of the problems with sound: It’s physical energy.
The best (and classic) way to isolate your studio room from everything
around it is to build a room within a room. I won’t go into detail here, but
you can go to my Web site (www.jeffstrong.com) to find some resources
to get you started.
For the purpose of most home recordists who don’t have the money or
space to build a room within a room, the best thing you can do is to try to
understand what noises are getting in and getting out and deal with those.
For example, if you live in a house or apartment with neighbors close by,
don’t record live drums at night. You could also consider using a drum
machine or electronic drum set (plugged directly into the recorder) instead.

Another idea is to try to choose a room in your house or apartment that is
farthest away from outside noise (an interior room, for instance). Basements
also work well because they’re underground and most of the sound gets
absorbed by the ground. Installing a little fiberglass batting insulation in the
ceiling — typical house insulation that you can find at your local home
center — can isolate you pretty well from your neighbors’ ears. Detached
garages are generally farther away from other buildings, so sound has a
chance to dissipate before it reaches your neighbors (or before your neigh-
bors’ noise reaches your garage).
Also keep these things in mind when trying to isolate your studio:
✦Dead air and mass are your friends. The whole concept of a room
within a room is to create mass and still air space so that the invading or
escaping sound gets trapped. When you work on isolating your room,
try to design in some space that can trap air (creating dead air) — such
as a suspended ceiling or big upholstered furniture — or use double
layers of drywall on your walls (mass).
✦Don’t expect acoustical foam or carpet to reduce the noise. Using these
can help reduce the amount of sound that bounces around inside the
room but won’t do much to keep sound in (or out of) the room.
✦Isolate the instrument instead of the room. Isolating the sound of your
guitar amp can be much less expensive than trying to soundproof your
whole room. Most commercial studios have one or more isolation booths
for recording vocals and other acoustic instruments. You can use that
concept to create your own mini isolation booths.
One idea for a truly mini isolation booth is to make an insulated box for your
guitar (or bass) amp. If you just have to crank your amp to get the sound
you want, you can place it inside an insulated box to reduce the amount of
noise that escapes to the outside world. Check out Figure 2-11 to see what I
mean.
You can also create an isolated space in a closet by insulating it and closing
the door when you record, or you can put your guitar amp (or drums) in
another room and run a long cord from there to your recorder. If you do this,
remember that for long cord runs, you need to use balanced cords. Other-
wise, you might get a bunch of noise, and your signal might be too low-level
to record very well.
Sound control
After you create a room that’s as isolated from the outside world as possible,
you need to deal with how sound acts within your room.

Optimizing Your Studio
44
Sound travels through the air in the form of waves. These waves bounce
around the room and cause reflections (reverberations or echoes). One prob-
lem with most home studios is that they’re small. Compounding this, sound
travels very fast — 1,130 feet per second, to be exact. When you sit at your
monitors and listen, inevitably you hear the reflected sound as well as the
original sound that comes from your speakers. In a big room, you can hear
the original sound and reflections as separate sounds, meaning that the
reflections themselves become less of a problem. For a good home studio,
you have to tame these reflections so they don’t interfere with your ability to
clearly hear what’s coming from the speakers.
How all these reflections bounce around your room can get pretty compli-
cated. Read up on acoustics (how sound behaves) to discover more about
different room modes: axial (one dimension), tangential (two dimensions),
and oblique (three dimensions). Each relates to how sound waves interact
while they bounce around a room. Knowing your room’s modes can help 
you come up with an acoustical treatment strategy, but there are very

complicated formulas for figuring out your room’s modes, especially those
dastardly tangential and oblique modes.
You can find out more on room modes, as well as discover some room mode
calculators, on the Internet by using your favorite search engine and search-
ing for “room modes.” Go to the Web site matches, and you’ll see quite a few
places to start looking. I recommend that you research these modes; this
topic alone could fill an entire book.
So, at the risk of offending the professional acoustical engineers in the world,
I’m going to share some tricks that I’ve been using in my studios. My main
goal has been to create a room with a sound I like and that gives me some
measure of control over the reflections within the room. Because I both
record and mix in one room (as do most home recordists), it’s helpful to be
able to make minor adjustments to the sound to accommodate what it is I’m
trying to accomplish.
The two aspects of recording where sound control plays a major role —
tracking and mixing — each require different approaches for you to get the
best possible sound out of your recordings. I cover both these aspects in the
following sections.
Sound control during tracking
Tracking is what you’re doing when you’re actually recording. Two things
that can make a room a bad environment for tracking are
✦Not enough sound reflection
✦Too much sound reflection
The goal when tracking is to have a room that’s not so dead (in terms of
sound reflection) that it sucks the life out of your instrument yet not so alive
that it colors the sound too much. The determining factor in how much
reflection you want in your room is based upon the instrument that you
record and how it sounds in the room.
If your room is too dead (not enough sound reflection), you want to add
some reflective surfaces to liven up things (the room, that is). On the other
hand, if your room is too live (too much sound reflection), you need to add
some absorptive materials to tame those reflections.
You could go out and buy a bunch of foam panels to catch the reflections, or
maybe put in a wood floor or attach some paneling to the walls to add some
life, but you’d be stuck with the room sounding only one way. It might end
up sounding good for recording drums or acoustic guitar, but then it would
probably be too live for getting a great vocal sound (which requires a deader
space). One solution that I’ve found to work well is to get (or make) some
portable panels that can either absorb or reflect the sound.

Optimizing Your Studio
46
Figure 2-12 shows an absorber/reflector that I’ve used and have found to
work quite well. (Go to my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com, for plans to
build your own.) One side has an absorptive material (dense fiberglass insu-
lation), and the other side has a reflective surface (wood). They are put
together in an attractive frame and designed to stack easily when you want
them out of the way. Even with very little woodworking experience, you can
crank out a set of them in a weekend for very little money (about $30 per
panel). I guarantee that if you make them (or hire someone to make them for
you), you’ll find dozens of uses for them around your studio.
Sound control during mixing
Your first step in getting control of the sound of your (probably less-than-
perfect) room during mixing is to get a good pair of near-field monitors.
Near-field monitors (as you can read about earlier in this chapter) are
designed to be listened to up close (hence the “near” in their name) and will
lessen the effects that the rest of the room has on your ability to hear them
accurately and get a good mix.

The next step to mixing in an imperfect room is to mix at low volumes. I
know: That takes the fun out of it, right? Well, as fun as it might be to mix at
high volumes, it rarely translates into a great mix. Great mixing engineers
often listen to their mixers at very low levels. Yes, they occasionally use high
levels, but only after the mixing is pretty much done — and then only for
very short periods of time. After all, if you damage your ears, you blow your
career as a sound engineer. (Hey, that rhymes! Or is there an echo in here?) I
don’t want to sound like your mother, but try to resist the temptation to
crank it up. Your ears last longer, and your mixes sound better.
Even with these two things (near-field monitors and low mixing levels), you
still need to do something to your room to make it work better for you. The
secret to a good mixing room is to tame the reflections of the sound coming
out of your speakers.
Dealing with high and midrange frequencies is pretty easy — just put up
some foam panels or the absorptive side of the panels shown in Figure 2-12.
(See? I told you that you’d have a use for those panels.) Start by hanging two
(or putting them on a stand or table) so they’re level with your speakers on
the wall behind you. Also, put one on each sidewall right where the speakers
are pointed. (See Figure 2-13.) This positioning gets rid of the higher frequen-
cies and eliminates much of the echo.
You might also need to put something on your ceiling right above your head,
especially if you have a low (8 feet or less) or textured ceiling. (You know, one
with that popcorny stuff sprayed on.) You might not want to mount one of
the absorption panels over your head because they’re fairly heavy. Wrapping
up a couple of 2' x 4' panels made of dense fiberglass (the same ones used in
the absorber/reflectors) in fabric would work just about perfectly. In fact,
you can make some overhead diffusers like the ones shown in Figure 2-14
very easily. (The plans for these are also on my Web site at www.
jeffstrong.com.)
You can also place a set of these overhead panels in the corners of your
room behind the speakers. Just hang them at the same height of your speak-
ers so that they cut off the corner of the room. If there isn’t enough room to
fit the panels at an angle in the corner, you can eliminate the backing from
the fiberglass and bend the fabric-covered panel to fit right in the corner.
Either approach will absorb sound that might otherwise bounce around
behind the speakers.
Another thing that you need to consider when you’re mixing is standing
waves, which are created when bass tones begin reflecting around your
room and bounce into each other. Standing waves have a weird effect on mix

quality. They can either overemphasize the bass from your speakers (result-
ing in mixes that are short on bass) or cancel out some — or all — of the
bass coming out of your speakers (resulting in mixes with too much bass).
One of the problems with standing waves is that they can really mess up
your mixes, and you might not even be aware that they are there.

To find out whether you have a problem with standing waves in your studio,
sit in front of your monitors and put on one of your favorite CDs. Now listen
carefully. Okay, now lean forward and backward a little bit. Does the amount
of bass that you hear change as you move? Next, get up and walk around the
room. Listen for places within the room where the bass seems to be louder
or softer. You might find places where the bass drops out almost completely.
If either inspection gives you a variable experience of the bass, you are the
proud owner of standing waves. Don’t worry, though. You can tame that
standing-wave monster with a pair of bass traps.
Bass traps absorb the energy in the lower frequencies so they don’t bounce
all over your room and throw off your mixes. You can buy bass traps made
of foam from some music stores, or (yep, you guessed it) you can make your
own out of wood and insulation. Check out Figure 2-15 for a look at some
homemade bass traps. (The plans to make these are — you guessed it —
located on my Web site: www.jeffstrong.com.)

The most common placement for bass traps is in the corners behind you
when you’re sitting at your mixer (as shown in Figure 2-16). You might also
find that putting a set in the other corners of the room helps even more.
After you place the bass traps, do the listening test again. If you notice some
areas where the bass seems to get louder or softer, try moving the bass
traps around a little. With some trial and error, you’ll most likely find a place
where they seem to work best.
Try not to get stressed out about the sound of your room. As important as
your room’s sound may be, it has a lot less effect on the quality of your
recordings than good, solid engineering practices. I know, I keep saying this,
but it’s important to remember. Do what you can, and then work with what
you’ve got.

f you’ve ever been to a recording studio and watched a great recording
engineer create a mix, you’ve probably been entranced by how he or she
interacted with the mixing board: a dance around the mixer, a twist of a
knob here, a push of a slider there. All this to the beat of the music. It’s like
watching a genius painter paint, or a great orchestra conductor conduct, or
a brilliant surgeon surge . . . er, operate. I’ll even bet that one of the reasons
you got interested in home recording is so you could have a chance to play
with those knobs yourself. Go ahead and admit it — you’ll feel better.
Well, you get your chance in this chapter. Not only do you discover what
each of those knobs does, you get a feel for all the functions that the mixer
fulfills in the studio. You discover what makes up a channel strip and how
it’s used. You get a chance to see how routing works (and even discover
what routing is). And you see how digital mixers use fader banks to provide
numerous functions while taking up very little space.
Meeting the Many Mixer Types
Pro Tools has an integrated mixer as part of its software, with which you
can effectively do anything that you could possibly want (and more) with
your music. You can adjust equalizers (EQ), levels, panning, and routing (to
name just a few) by either using keystrokes on your computer keyboard or
administering a click of your mouse.
Even with all the power that the Pro Tools mixer has, some people (myself
included) like to have some knobs to twiddle and some faders to slide while
they work. If you’re one of these people, the following sections help you
decide which of the three hardware options would work best for you.

Meeting the Many Mixer Types
54
Analog mixer
An analog mixer, as shown in Figure 3-1, enables you to route the signals
within the analog domain. Analog mixers tend to have many knobs, lights,
and faders — a set for each channel. If you want to change from mixing
inputs (your instruments) to mixing sounds recorded on the recorder, you
need to plug and unplug cords, or you need to get a mixer with twice as
many channels as your recorder.
Many people prefer analog mixers because they believe they produce better
sound than the mixer in Pro Tools software (not necessarily the case, at least
to my ears), or they want to create elaborate mixes for a band to hear in
their headphones while they record.

The main disadvantage to using an analog mixer with Pro Tools (or any
other computer-based recording system) is that you need just as many
analog inputs and outputs for your Digidesign hardware as you want chan-
nels to mix in your mixer. For example, if you want to mix a 16-track song,
you need the equivalent of two Digi 002 Rack interfaces, assuming Digidesign
would let you hook up two at once. At the time of this writing you are limited
to just one. (For more on audio interfaces, check out Chapter 1 of this mini-
book.) The other possible disadvantage is that each analog-to-digital-to-
analog conversion degrades the sound of your music.
Digital mixer
A digital mixer, as shown in Figure 3-2, is a great option for Pro Tools users
because it can perform the same functions as a conventional analog mixer in
a lot less space, and you don’t have to worry about having as many analog
connections. Also, the whole issue of sound degradation from going back and
forth to digital is moot because all your music stays in the digital domain.
If you want to use a digital mixer with Pro Tools, make sure that it’s compati-
ble with the software — an easy task if you go to www.digidesign.com/
compato — and that you have enough channels of digital connection in your
hardware. (Book II, Chapter 2 details each Digidesign hardware capability.)
Like in Pro Tools software, routing — sending your signals to various places
within the mixer — becomes almost easy using a digital mixer. You can switch
between input and track channels without having to change a single cord.

One of the great things about digital mixers is that any EQ or effects plug-ins
that you use are powered by the processor in the mixer, not the processor in
your computer. This can allow you to have many more effects on your mixes
(not always a good thing) before your system bogs down.
The downside to this arrangement is that you’re stuck with the EQ and
effects that are part of your mixer. If they aren’t that great to begin with, you
might not want to use them.
The computer control surface
A computer control surface is a piece of hardware that interfaces with your
computer to control the controls within the Pro Tools software. As far as I’m
concerned, a computer control surface, like the one included with the Digi
003, is the way to go with Pro Tools — as long as you have a powerful-enough
computer to handle the mix — because all your EQ and effects processing is
still done in the computer, unlike what you’d get with a digital or analog
mixer. (Chapter 1 of this mini-book has more on what constitutes a powerful-
enough computer.) Quite a few control surfaces integrate smoothly with Pro
Tools, including the cool-looking Command|8 shown in Figure 3-3.
Before you buy a control surface from another manufacturer, check out the
compatibility page at the Digidesign Web site at www.digidesign.com/
compato to make sure that the one you want works with Pro Tools.

These controllers send MIDI messages — coded with the Musical Instrument
Digital Interface communications protocol — to the computer telling it
which parameters to change. These controllers can easily be programmed
to work like a separate digital mixer.
Understanding Mixer Basics
In spite of the many types of mixers out there (see the “Meeting the Many
Mixer Types” section, earlier in this chapter), you’ll discover that they all
generally follow the same basic principles and have a number of elements in
common. You’ll also discover that regardless of the type of mixer you use,
two mixing aspects — the channel strip and busing (routing) — are univer-
sal. The rest of this chapter concentrates pretty heavily on these two
aspects.
Think of a mixing board as a sort of air-traffic controller for the audio world.
Just like how the guys and gals in the towers near an airport communicate
with all the planes in the air, making sure that collisions are avoided and that
traffic moves quickly and efficiently, the mixer routes all the incoming and
outgoing signals from the instruments, effects, and recording devices so they
get to their desired destination without any problems.
Channel strip
The mixer is composed of numerous channels into which you process the
signal of an instrument or microphone before it’s sent to the recorder. This is
the channel strip. (See upcoming Figure 3-6.) Even though the mixer might
look confusing with all its knobs, lights, and sliders, you need to understand
the basic makeup of just one channel to understand them all. The channel
strip’s job is to take the signal from an instrument or microphone and send it
where you want it.
The channel strip also enables you to make adjustments to the level of the
signal in a variety of ways: overall level, a certain frequency’s level (different
for each mixer), left or right stereo level, and effect levels.
The channel strip serves two functions:
✦To control the level of an input device (input channel)
✦To control the level of a recorded track (track channel)
Both functions of the channel strip operate the same way. In fact, you can
use the same channel for either an input or a track signal. The only differ-
ence is which device (an instrument or the output from your recorder) is
plugged in.

Understanding Mixer Basics
58
Input jack
An input jack, generally located on the back of the mixer (although it can
also be on the upper part of the top of the mixer), is where you plug in your
instrument (or microphone or the output from your recorder). Many profes-
sional mixers have both a quarter-inch and an XLR jack for each channel.
(See Figure 3-4.) For the lowdown on jacks, read through Chapter 2 of this
mini-book.
A quarter-inch jack is used for line-level sources, such as a synthesizer, a
drum machine, or the cord from the Line Out of your guitar amp. An XLR
jack is for the male end of the microphone cord. Most semi-pro and pro
mixers also have phantom power available to a XLR jack. The phantom
power feature sends a low level of current from the mixer to the microphone
to get the microphone to produce a signal. Phantom power is necessary for
professional condenser mics.
If you choose not to mic your guitar amp and instead want to plug your
guitar directly into your mixer, you need to do one of three things:
✦Plug your guitar into your amp and run a cord from the Line Output of
the amp to the mixer’s channel input.
✦Plug your guitar into a direct box (a device that changes the impedance
level of your guitar or bass; Book I, Chapter 1 has more on this) and plug
the direct box into the channel input of your mixer.
✦Plug your guitar directly into the hi-Z input (high impedance) of your
mixer, if it has one. (You’ll find this feature on many newer mixers.)
Most pro mixers allow you to use either a balanced or unbalanced cord. (For
the scoop on balanced and unbalanced cords, see Book I, Chapter 2.) Read
through the owner’s manual for your mixer to find whether balanced con-
nections are part of your mixer’s specs. Balanced connections are important
only if you have really long cords (longer than 25 feet, for instance) because
they cut down on the noise that can result from long cord runs that use
unbalanced cords.
Insert jack
Aside from quarter-inch and XLR input jacks, another jack — an Insert 
jack — is often found on the back of the mixer for each channel. Its purpose
is to enable you to send the signal from the channel out to a processor, such
as a compressor or an EQ, and to receive the signal after it’s processed.
Unlike the Effect Send (as described in the upcoming section on Auxiliary
Send knobs), this jack won’t let you mix in as much effect signal as you 
want — all the signal is affected. Figure 3-4 shows a typical set of input jacks.

To use the Insert jack, you need a Y cable, as shown in Figure 3-5. You con-
nect the plug at the base of the Y to the mixer Insert jack; the plugs on the
two arms of the Y go into the input and output jacks of the processor.

Trim knob
The job of the Trim knob (labeled as Gain on your Digidesign interface) is to
adjust the level of the input signal as it enters the mixer. (You usually find
the Trim knob at the top of the front panel of the channel strip, as shown
in Figure 3-6.) The amount that you adjust the Trim knob depends on the
instrument that you plugged in to the channel strip; so be sure to listen as
you make your adjustments.
✦If the Trim knob is set too high: You get distortion.
✦If the Trim knob is set too low: You get too weak of a signal to record.
Most Trim knobs have a switch or markings for Line or Mic(rophone) sig-
nals. See these markings in Figure 3-6. Turn the knob all the way left for line
sources — or slowly keep turning it right for microphone sources — until
you get a nice, clean sound coming into the mixer. See Book III, Chapter 2 for
more on setting input levels.
If you choose to use an external preamp, check the owner’s manual of your
mixer to see whether you can bypass the internal preamp. Most professional
mixers enable you to do this. Sometimes just having the Trim knob all the
way down (to the Line marking) disengages the preamp from the circuit —
and this is the case with the Digidesign preamps. You can also plug into the
line inputs if you want to keep your Digidesign preamps free for other mics
or instruments.
Equalization
Semi-pro and pro mixers give you the opportunity to adjust the equalization
(EQ) of your signal — that is, to boost or reduce specific ranges of sound 
frequency. Less expensive mixers have fewer equalizer settings (as few as 
two — one for high frequencies and one for low frequencies). Pro mixers
have three or four; digital mixers and software mixers might have more.
Channel Auxiliary (Aux) Send knobs
You might want to add an effect, such as reverb or delay, to the signal
coming into your mixer. With effects such as reverb, you don’t want to use
the Insert jack — like you would with a compressor — because you want to
be able to control how much of the effect you actually hear. (Compressors
affect the entire signal, not some portion of it. You can find more about com-
pressors in Book VI, Chapter 4.)

This is where the Auxiliary (Aux) Send feature comes in. That’s what the
little knobs in the middle of the channel strip in Figure 3-6 are for. Adjust
these knobs to send as much (or as little) of the signal as you want to go to
the appropriate auxiliary component (Aux, get it?). Doing so specifies how
much (or how little) of the effects processing shows up in your final sound.
Turning the knob to the left produces less effect; turning it to the right gives
you more effect.
Not only can you set the Effect Send level at each channel (and you can send
more than one channel’s signal to each effect), you can also adjust the level
of the affected signal that’s brought back into the mixer and mixed with all
the dry signals at the master bus. (See the “Routing/Busing Signals” section
later in this chapter.) This is the Aux Return, which you can find out more
about in the “Auxiliary (Aux) Return knobs” section, later in this chapter.
Pre/Post switch
The Pre/Post switch enables you to send the signal to the Aux bus (through
the Aux Send knobs) either before (pre) it gets through the EQ and channel
fader or after (post) it goes there. Use the Pre/Post switch to send an
unequalized signal to the effect, and then to adjust the EQ of the dry (unaf-
fected) signal without affecting what the effect sounds like. You can also use
the Pre/Post switch to control the level of both the signal and the effect with
the channel fader.
Having this option gives you more flexibility to control what the affected
sound will sound like. For example, you can send the dry signal of a kick
drum to a reverb (with the switch in the Pre position) and then boost the
bass on the dry signal. Doing this gives you some reverb on the higher fre-
quencies without adding it to the lower ones, which would create some mud
in the final mix. The downside to this is that you can’t use a fader to control
the level of the signal being sent to the effect. (You bypassed the fader in the
Pre position.) In this case, if you raise and lower the channel fader, the
amount of effect that you hear in relation to the dry signal will change as
well. For example, when you lower the fader, you hear more effect because
less dry signal is mixed in. Comparatively, when you raise the fader, you hear
less effect because the dry signal is louder and the effect level is the same.
Pan knob
Use the Pan knob to adjust where in the stereo field (how far left or right)
your signal is heard. This knob is generally located toward the bottom of the
channel strip and is an important part of mixing. Where you put something
in the stereo field has an effect on how well it’s heard among all the other
instruments playing through the mixer. (Book VI, Chapter 1 has more details
on panning and mixing.)

Mute switch
The Mute switch, located toward the bottom of the channel strip, enables you
to silence (mute) the channel. This switch is commonly used during mix-
down to help you work with the sound of a particular part in the mix. This
switch allows you to quickly silence the parts you don’t want to hear when
you’re mixing so you can concentrate on the sound of the instruments that
you want to hear. For example, when you work in EQing and balancing the
levels of the drum set, you can use the mute switch for all the other chan-
nels so you hear only the drumset tracks.
Solo switch
The Solo switch, when engaged, allows one channel to “sing solo” while
muting all the rest. This switch (normally located near the Mute switch) is
also commonly used during mixdown when you want to hear only one
instrument. This saves you the hassle of having to press the Mute switch on
all the rest of the channels. For example, when you work on EQing and are
affecting the lead vocal, you can press the Solo switch to mute all the other
instruments while you make your adjustments. Then, when you want to hear
what your adjusted vocal sounds like with the rest of the instruments, all
you have to do is disengage the Solo switch (press it again).
Assign switches
The Assign switches can be located just above the fader, at the top of the
mixer, or right next to the fader. Use these switches to choose where to send
the outgoing signal. You can send it to the Master bus or to any of the
submix buses. (For more on buses — the electronic pathways along which
signals are sent — see its upcoming section.) If your mixer doesn’t have a
separate Solo switch, one of the Assign switches can give you the option of
soloing that channel.
Faders
A fader, usually a slider control located at the bottom of each channel strip,
determines the overall level of the signal coming out of the channel strip
before it makes its way to the recorder, the Master bus, or the submix bus.
(Check out the following section for more details.)
Routing/Busing Signals
After you have an instrument plugged into the mixer channel strip, you want
to send that signal somewhere. This is routing or busing. (The place where

Routing/Busing Signals
64
the signal ends up is, conveniently enough, a bus.) Most mixers offer numer-
ous busing possibilities, including busing to the
✦Master bus: Send your mixed music to a two-track recorder.
✦Submix bus: Mix several tracks before they go to the Master bus.
✦Control Room bus: Listen to the tracks through your monitors.
✦Auxiliary bus: Add an effect to your signal.
In the following sections, I introduce you to some of the most used busing
options and describe some ways to make this process easier.
The busing controls are generally located on the right side of the mixing con-
sole, as shown in upcoming Figure 3-7. Here you have faders for the Master
and submix (Sub) buses; dials for the Aux bus; and Solo and Mute buttons
for the Master and submix (Sub) buses. This area is often called the master
control section of the mixer.
Master fader
A Master fader, located in the lower-right corner of Figure 3-7, controls the
Master bus, where your mixed music goes out to the 2-track recorder or
back into Pro Tools. When you have something plugged into a channel input,
it’s automatically sent to the Master bus. Where you have your Pan knob set
for each channel (how far to the left or right) dictates how much signal is
sent to the left or right channels of the Master bus. Some mixers are
designed with only one Master fader to control both left and right channels;
on other mixers, you have one fader for each left and right channel.
Sub (submix) faders
Depending on the mixer you own, you may or may not have a group of Sub
(submix) faders located to the left of the Master fader, as shown in Figure
3-7. Submix faders control the submix buses, which is where you can mix sev-
eral of your tracks and group them independently of the rest of the tracks.
You use the Assign switches for each channel to choose which (if any)
submix buses you want the signal sent to.
The submix can be sent out of the mixer as a unit. For example, you might
want to record all the drums on one or two tracks instead of recording them
individually. The submix is also routed to the Master bus as a unit. If you
assign instruments to a submix, they get diverted from the Master bus and
go to the submix fader first. Then everything assigned to that submix fader
gets sent to the Master bus to be controlled by the Master fader. Most
mixers also allow you to send the submix out without having to go through
the Master bus first; often, submix outputs are located on the back of the
mixer.

Solo/Mute switches
Above each submix fader on your mixer, you’ll most likely have Mute and
Solo switches, as shown in Figure 3-7. Use these switches to, well, solo or
mute (that is, isolate or silence) the submix group. For example, you might
want to hear only the submix of the drums or maybe background vocals.
This switch allows you to quickly check your submix.
Control Room level knob
The Control Room level knob, usually located above the Master fader, as
shown in Figure 3-7, controls the level of the signal going through the Control
Room bus — the signal that’s sent to your studio monitors. The Control Room
level knob is fed by the Master bus and has the same mix that goes through
the master output to your recorder. This allows you to have a different volume
than the master level so you can monitor at a different volume than the level
being sent out through the Master bus.
The Control Room level knob is especially useful when you’re recording and
sending a high level to the recorder but also want to listen to what’s being
recorded — at a more comfortable, lower volume — through the monitor
speakers.
Phones knob
Like the Control Room level knob, the Phones knob (located above the
Control Room level knob in Figure 3-7) enables you to adjust the level going
to the headphones independently of the master level. The Phones knob is
fed by the Master bus and has the same mix as the Master fader.
Auxiliary (Aux) Send knobs
The Aux Send knobs, also located in the master controls section of the mixer,
allow you to send the entire mix from the Master bus to an effects processor,
such as a reverb or delay. In Figure 3-7, you can see the Aux Send knobs
above the submix fader on the left.
Auxiliary (Aux) Return knobs
The Aux Return knobs control the overall level for each of the signals routed
through an effects processor and sent back to the Master bus. You use these
knobs to mix in the amount of wet (affected) signal that you want. The wet
signal mixes with the dry (unaffected) signals from each of the channels.
Aux Assign
Some mixers can route a signal sent through an effects processor to any of
the submix buses, where they can be controlled by the corresponding

Book I
Chapter 3
Meeting the 
Mixing Board

67
submix fader. This Aux Assign capability enables you to have (for instance)
the reverb you want on the drums routed to the submix fader that controls
the overall drum level. You choose your bus by pressing in the corresponding
Assign button.
Master Level meters
At the top of many mixers are the Master Level meters, which keep tabs on
recording levels and warn you when you might be producing a signal that’s
too strong or too weak. Too strong of a signal can lead to distortion; too
weak of a signal produces a sound that lacks fidelity (sounds thin). Master
Level meters can come in the form of VU (volume unit) meters (the ones
with needles that go back and forth) or as LED lights (where green is good,
and red is bad).
Deciphering Output Jacks
Most mixers have a bunch of output jacks (where — you guessed it — the
signal comes out) located at the left on the back of the mixer, as shown in
Figure 3-8. You often find output jacks for the Master bus, headphones, moni-
tors, and Direct Outs for each channel, as well as jacks for the Aux Returns.
Master Out jack
The Master Out jack goes to the power amp for your speakers or to a master-
ing recorder (2-track). This jack is controlled by the Master fader and sends
the signal that’s routed through the Master bus.
Phones jack
The Phones jack is for your headphones and is fed by the Phones knob on
the master console, which carries the same signal as the Master bus — only
you get to control the volume separately.
Monitors jack
The Monitors jack is where you plug in your monitor speakers. Control this
jack with the Monitor (or Control Room) knob on the mixer. It carries the
signal from the Master bus to the speakers.
Direct Out jacks
You get Direct Out jacks on more full-featured mixers. These jacks are con-
trolled by their corresponding channel fader (Channel 1 goes to Direct Out 1,
Channel 2 to Direct Out 2, and so on). The signal goes directly out from each
channel without going through the Master bus.

Deciphering Output Jacks
68
Most semi-pro and pro mixers won’t actually have a Direct Out for each
mixer channel. That’s no big deal because Direct Out jacks are designed so
you can send a signal directly out (hence the name) from the channel to a
recorder. If you don’t have Direct Outs on your mixer, you can just use the
Insert jack to send your signal directly out of the mixer and into the recorder.
The exact procedure for this connection depends on your mixer; check your
owner’s manual.
Direct Out jacks are really helpful when you’re recording with overdubs,
when you layer a track by recording one instrument at a time. For example,
you could record the drums on Channels 1–4, the bass guitar on Channel 5,
and the guitar part on Channel 6. You then send the signal via the Direct
Outs from Channels 1–6 to the recorder’s Tracks 1–6 and send those signals
back to the mixer on Channels 9–14. You could then use Channel 7 to record
the lead guitar part to Track 7 of the recorder while listening to Tracks 1–6
on Channels 9–14. This saves you from having to crawl behind your mixer
and change cords when you want to hear the recorded track.

As you can see, the mixer setup can get complicated. Don’t worry. After you
get to know your mixer and get a chance to try some different routing config-
urations, this stuff will become second nature to you.
Aux Return jacks
Aux Return jacks are where you plug in the cord from the Line Out jack of
your effects processor. This jack is fed to the Aux Return knob.
Making Life Easier with a Patch Bay
After you set up your mixer and plug it into the input devices, effects proces-
sors, and recorder, you’re set to go. But what if you want to record a track
and then listen to it right away to see whether you like what you hear? Well,
for most home recordists, this can be a problem because you’ll most likely
have only enough channel strips in your mixer for either recording or for lis-
tening. If this is the case, you have to crawl behind the mixer and unplug
your input device and then plug in the outputs from your recorder. Then,
when you’re done listening, you have to switch the cables back to record
again. All this crawling and connecting can be time-consuming (and eventu-
ally hard on your cables).
The solution is to get a patch bay, which is a device that consists almost
entirely of input and output jacks. You plug your gear into it so you can
change the cord configuration without crawling around behind your big pile
of technology. Check out Figure 3-9 for a look at a patch bay.
An essential tool for analog studios, a patch bay is also useful for the more
complicated digital studios as well. Patch bays function by giving two series
of jacks:
✦One in the back where you plug in all your gear
✦One in the front that you can use to patch — connect with cables — any
one piece of gear into any other
Figure 3-9:

For example, imagine that you want to plug in the output from your synthe-
sizer into Channels 1 and 2, and you want to record your friend’s guitar on
Channel 3. At the same time, you want to monitor the bass guitar on Channel
4 and the drums on Channels 5–8. This is pretty straightforward, but what if
you want to hear what you recorded on Channels 1–3? With a patch bay, all
you have to do is change the cords going into mixer Channels 1–3 at the
patch bay.
You still have to change cords when you use a patch bay, but at least every-
thing is upfront and accessible; without a patch bay, you’re stuck having to
crawl behind your mixer and recorder to change the cords.

M
y first job in a recording studio was in 1985. I can still remember the
first time I walked into that studio. The owner was sitting, arms
crossed, in front of the mixing console (called a console in those days
because the mixer was an actual piece of furniture that took up nearly the
whole room). He looked at me and hit a key on the Macintosh computer sit-
ting next to him. Then all of a sudden, a synthesizer started playing, then
another, and yet another. “This is cool,” I thought. But then I heard my
nemesis — the drum machine.
Drum machines made me lose my recording gigs as a drummer and drove
me to expand my career to that of a recording engineer as well. However, I
eventually came to love that drum machine and the many others to follow
(sigh). In fact, over the years, I became so captivated by the whole MIDI/
drum machine thing that I assembled a whole series of electronic drumsets
using drum machines and samplers — all controlled through MIDI.
In this chapter, you find out how MIDI enables synthesizers and computers
to communicate with one another — a revolutionary thing for the musician.
You get your hands dirty in the world of sequencing — recording MIDI per-
formance information so you can play your performance automatically. You
also peruse a variety of MIDI-capable instruments and explore the ins and
outs of controlling your MIDI gear.
Like audio recording, MIDI can be a deep subject. You can go nuts trying to
understand every little nuance of MIDI. (I know some guys who are not quite
the same after plunging headfirst into this stuff.) The reality is that to use
MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know every little thing about it. In this
chapter, I focus on what you need to know to get started.

Meeting MIDI
72
Meeting MIDI
MIDI is a protocol (a set of agreed-upon standards) for musical instruments
to communicate with one another through a cabled connection and a
common digital language. This arrangement allows each one to understand
the other, regardless of manufacturer or instrument. All that’s required is an
instrument equipped with MIDI ports (jacks).
MIDI data is different from an audio recording because it contains no sound
as such; rather, it’s limited to performance information. This includes infor-
mation about various performance characteristics, which (for keyboards, at
least) includes the following:
✦Note-on and note-off: What note is played and when
✦Velocity: How hard someone presses a key
✦After-touch: Whether the key pressure changes after the initial press
✦Vibrato and pitch bend: Whether the pitch changes while a key is
pressed
This information allows the MIDI musician to potentially create a perform-
ance that is as rich in texture as those of the world’s finest players.
Digital messages sent from one device to another across a cable (called the
MIDI cable, of course) create MIDI data. The cable connects to MIDI ports on
each device, and the messages are sent in the form of binary digits. Each
instrument can understand and respond to these messages.
Perusing MIDI ports
The three types of MIDI ports are In, Out, and Thru.
✦In: The In port receives incoming messages.
✦Out: This port sends those messages.
✦Thru: This port sends the messages that one device receives directly 
to the In port of another instrument. You use the Thru port when you
create a daisychain, which means you connect more than two devices.
Figure 4-1 shows a daisychain setup.

Book I
Chapter 4
MIDI and Electronic
Instruments
Meeting MIDI
73
MIDI signals travel in only one direction. Data flows from the Out port of one
device to an In port of another device — but not the other way around.
Likewise, data going through the Thru port originates from the first device in
the chain — not the device whose Thru port is being used. The particular
way that data flows is what gives you flexibility in how you can connect dif-
ferent devices together. Here are some examples:
✦Example 1: In Figure 4-1, three synthesizers are connected in a daisy-
chain lineup. A cable connects device A’s Out port to device B’s In port.
Another cable connects device B’s Thru port to device C’s In port. In this
scenario, device A controls devices B and C. Devices B and C can’t con-
trol any other device, because neither device B nor device C has a con-
nection from its Out port.
✦Example 2: Suppose you connect device B to device C by using device
B’s Out port instead of its Thru port. In this case, device A sends mes-
sages to device B but not to device C. Device B controls device C. Device
C has no control over either A or B because neither one is connected to
device C’s Out port.
✦Example 3: Now take a look at Figure 4-2. In this figure, two devices 
have MIDI cables running from the Out port of each to the In port of the
other — which allows communication to go both ways. (The MIDI inter-
face in this figure is necessary for making MIDI connections in a com-
puter.) For example, a master synthesizer and a computer sequencer are
frequently connected this way so you can send performance information

from the synthesizer to the sequencer (when you’re recording your
part) and from the sequencer back to the synthesizer (when you want to
play the part back again).
A connection to a MIDI device’s In port or through a device’s Thru port 
doesn’t allow the device to control another device. A MIDI device can con-
trol another device only if the cable is connected from its Out port to the
other device’s In port.
Understanding MIDI channels
Okay, so you have a daisychain of MIDI instruments all hooked together, and
you want to control them from your master keyboard or sequencer program.
Now you want the drum machine to play the drum part and a sound module
to play the string part. This is where MIDI channels come in handy.
MIDI channels allow you to designate which messages go to a particular
machine. You can program each machine to receive messages on one or
more of the 16 MIDI channels. For instance, you can set your drum machine
to receive messages on Channel 10 (the default channel for drum sounds)
and set the sound module with the string sounds to receive data on 
Channel 1. (You set the MIDI channels on your digital instrument by going
into the System Parameters menu. Check your owner’s manual for specific
procedures.) After you assign your channels, your master keyboard sends
the performance information for both MIDI signals — the drum machine and
the sound module playing the string sounds — across one MIDI cable. Each
receiving device responds only to the messages directed to the MIDI channel
that it’s assigned to receive.

75
In this scenario, the sound module with the string sounds receives all the
data from the master keyboard, responds to the messages on Channel 1, and
simultaneously sends the data from the master keyboard onto the drum
machine (via the sound module’s Thru port). The drum machine receives
the same messages from the master keyboard as the sound module but
responds only to those sent for Channel 10.
Having 16 MIDI channels allows you to have up to 16 separate instruments
playing different parts at the same time. You may use 16 different devices or
16 different parts from the same device if you have a multitimbral sound gen-
erator. (See the “Synthesizers” section later in this chapter for more on such
sound generators.)
You’d think that each MIDI channel would be sent along its own wire in the
MIDI cable. That’s actually not the case. Inside the MIDI cable are three 
wires — two for data transmission, and one to serve as a shield. MIDI mes-
sages are sent across the two wires via a channel code, which tells the receiv-
ing device to what channel it should send the data following the code. Such a
MIDI channel message, also called a channel voice message, precedes each
performance command.
Appreciating MIDI messages
In order for MIDI instruments to communicate with one another, they need
to have a vocabulary in common. This is where MIDI messages come in. MIDI
messages contain an array of commands, including performance data, con-
trol changes, system-common messages, and system-exclusive messages
(more about this shortly).
Not all MIDI devices recognize all MIDI commands. For example, a sound
module generally can’t send performance-data messages (such as after-
touch) because a sound module doesn’t have triggering mechanisms that
produce those commands.
Check your instrument’s manual for a MIDI Implementation Chart. All MIDI
instruments come with this chart. In it, you can find a list of all the MIDI
commands that the device can send or receive. The chart also includes
information on polyphony (how many notes the instrument can play at once
and multitimbrality (how many different sounds the instrument can produce
at the same time).
Performance data
Included in performance data are note-on and note-off messages, as well as
specifications for velocity, after-touch, vibrato, and pitch bend.

Meeting MIDI
76
MIDI performance-data messages each have 128 different values. For exam-
ple, each note that you play on the keyboard has a number associated with
it. Middle C is 60, for instance. Likewise, velocity is recorded and sent as a
number between 0 and 127, 0 being the softest volume (no sound) and 127
the loudest that you can play.
Control-change messages
Control-change messages are a type of performance-data message. These
messages contain data about expression, including modulation, volume, 
and pan.
System-common messages
System-common messages contain data about which channel the perform-
ance data is sent to and what sound in the sound library to play. System-
common messages also include information about timing data, master
volume, and effects settings.
System-exclusive messages
System-exclusive messages contain information that is exclusive to the
system or device. These messages can include data transfers of new sound
patches, among other things.
To use MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know all (or even many) of the
MIDI messages that a device can recognize. If you hook up your gear and
play, your MIDI devices generate and respond to the messages for you.
Managing modes
Your synthesizer, drum machine, or other MIDI module has four operating
modes, appropriately called Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, and Mode 4. These
modes dictate how your instrument responds to the MIDI messages it
receives.
Mode 1: Omni On/Poly
In Omni On/Poly mode, your instrument responds to all the MIDI messages
coming across the wires (well, except for the MIDI channel data). This means
that your synthesizer (or whatever) tries to play the parts of all the instru-
ments hooked up to your MIDI controller. In this mode, your device also
plays polyphonically (more than one note at a time).

Book I
Chapter 4
MIDI and Electronic
Instruments
Meeting MIDI
77
Some older MIDI devices default to Omni On/Poly mode (Mode 1) when you
turn them on. In such a case, you have to reset your instrument if it’s one of
several in your MIDI setup. If you don’t, the instrument responds to any MIDI
message sent from the controller, not just the ones directed toward it.
Mode 2: Omni On/Mono
Omni On/Mono allows your device to receive messages from all MIDI chan-
nels but lets it play only one note at time (monophonically). This mode is
rarely, if ever, used.
Mode 3: Omni Off/Poly
In the Omni Off/Poly mode, your device can play polyphonically but
responds only to MIDI signals on the channels that it’s set to. This is the
mode you use most often when you’re sequencing — recording or playing
back MIDI data. (Book V, Chapter 2 covers this process in Pro Tools in
greater detail.)
Mode 4: Omni Off/Mono
In the Omni Off/Mono mode, your instrument responds only to the messages
sent on the MIDI channel that it’s set to and ignores the rest. Rather than
play polyphonically, like in Mode 3, your instrument plays only one note at 
a time. This can be advantageous if you’re playing a MIDI controller from 
an instrument that can play only one note at a time, such as a flute or 
saxophone.
General MIDI
If you end up composing music for other people to play on their MIDI 
instruments — or if you want to use music from another composer —
General MIDI is invaluable to you. General MIDI (GM) is a protocol that
enables a MIDI instrument to provide a series of sounds and messages con-
sistent with other MIDI instruments. With General MIDI, you can take a
Standard MIDI File (SMF) of a song created on one sequencer program, trans-
fer the file to another program, and use that other program to play the exact
performance — sounds, timing, program changes, everything.
GM instruments contain numerous sound patches that the MIDI community
has standardized. Not all these sounds are exactly the same as far as sound
quality goes, but their sound type and location (acoustic grand piano on
Patch #1, for instance) is the same on all GM-compatible machines.
Not all MIDI-capable instruments follow the GM standards. If this feature is
important to you, be sure you find out before you buy whether the instru-
ment that interests you is GM compatible.

Getting Started with MIDI
78
GM standards dictate not only the particular sounds that a synthesizer has,
but also which drum sounds are located on which keys, how many notes of
polyphony the instrument has, and how many different channels the instru-
ment can receive and send instructions on. The two levels of GM compatibil-
ity are Level 1 and Level 2.
GM Level 1 compatibility
Level 1 protocols were developed in 1991 and consist of a minimum of 128
instrument patches, 24 notes of polyphony, receiving and sending capability
for all 16 MIDI channels, 16-part multitimbrality, and a host of controller and
performance messages.
GM Level 2 compatibility
Level 2 was implemented in 1999 and includes more sounds, polyphony, and
features. A GM Level 2-compatible device has 32 notes of polyphony, 16-
channel support, up to 16 simultaneous instrument sound patches, and a
host of additional sounds (384, to be exact), including 2 channels of simulta-
neous percussion sounds. Also added to the GM2 standard are reverb and
chorus effects.
Getting Started with MIDI
Enough with the technical aspects of MIDI — you want to know how to start
using this great technology, right?
More is better
Roland and Yamaha both decided a while ago
to raise the bar on the GM Level 1 standards by
developing their own protocols. Called GS and
XG, respectively, the machines conforming to
either of these standards are synthesizers on
steroids. For example, the Yamaha XG protocol
calls for a minimum of 480 sounds, including at
least 9 drumsets and 51 types of effects (reverb,
chorus, and variations), among a host of con-
trol-change messages. The Roland GS stan-
dard, on the other hand, requires at least 226
different instrument patches and 20 different
control-change messages, among other things.
If you use a GS or an XG synthesizer to com-
pose your music, you might be disappointed if
you play that composition back on a synthe-
sizer that doesn’t have the GS or XG enhance-
ments because the sound won’t be quite the
same. You’ll get the same instrument type
(grand piano, for instance), but the sound of the
instrument will be different. Also, if you use any
of the additional MIDI messages contained in
the GS and XG protocols (control change, for
example), they won’t be understood by the non-
GS or -XG device.

To get started, you first need to know just what you have to buy to do some
MIDI-ing yourself. Well, I’m sorry to inform you that you can’t do any of this
cool MIDI stuff with your vintage Stratocaster guitar or your acoustic drum-
set (unless you do some fancy rigging to your gear — see the sidebar, “MIDI
control this . . .”). What you do need is
✦A sound generator: This device, which enables you to hear the music,
could be a synthesizer, drum machine, sound module, or sampler.
✦A MIDI controller: This device controls the MIDI instruments in your
studio. You’ll most likely use the MIDI functions in Pro Tools for this pur-
pose. This might also be your keyboard, electronic drum pads, or other
MIDI instruments (such as the Roland GK2a).
✦A sequencer: This device records and plays the MIDI performances that
are programmed into it. The sequencer allows you to program your part
into the synthesizer and have it play back automatically (much like the
old-time player piano). Again, you’ll most likely use Pro Tools software
for this, but you could use a sequencer in your keyboard if you prefer.
✦A MIDI interface: The MIDI interface is used to enable your computer to
send and receive MIDI data. If you have an Mbox 2, an Mbox 2 Pro, a Digi
003, a Digi 003 Rack, or one of the M-Audio interfaces with equipped
MIDI ports, you already have what you need to get MIDI in and out of
your system. (Sorry, Mbox2 Mini and non-MIDI M-Audio users: You have
to buy a separate MIDI interface.)
I know this sounds like a lot of stuff, but most of this gear performs more
than one function in the MIDI studio. For example, nearly all synthesizers
come with drum sounds, and some synthesizers even include a sequencer. In
this case, this one synthesizer can do the job of sound generator, drum
machine, MIDI controller, and sequencer all in one.
In the following sections, I discuss the different types of sound generators.
You might indeed find one piece of equipment that does everything you
want. In that’s not your situation, read on as I separate all the features that
different equipment has. That way, you can understand the function of each
feature and then decide how to configure your studio.
Sound generators
The sound generator is the core of the MIDI studio. This is what produces
the sounds that you hear. Without it, you might as well skip the rest of the
stuff because (of course) you won’t hear any of your work.
Sound generators can come in many different shapes and sizes: a fully func-
tional keyboard synthesizer, an independent drum machine, a standalone

Getting Started with MIDI

sound module, samplers, software synthesizers (soft-synths), and a com-
puter sound card. Each of these devices has its strengths and weaknesses.
(Read on for the details.)
Synthesizers
A synthesizer, like the one shown in Figure 4-3, consists of not only sounds
but also a keyboard on which you can play these sounds. Synthesizers come
in a variety of sizes and configurations. For example, some keyboards come
with 61 keys (5 octaves), and others provide as many as 88 keys (the number
on an acoustic piano keyboard).
If you’re in the market for a synthesizer, you need to consider several things:
✦Polyphony: Polyphony is the number of notes that sound at one time.
Most decent synthesizers nowadays have at least 16 notes of polyphony
although models that can produce 32 notes at once are not uncommon.
Each manufacturer treats polyphony differently, and the GM standards
allow some variations on the effective use of this parameter. For
instance, a synth patch might use more than one digital sound to create
the actual sound you hear. The synth patch that you love so much
might, in fact, consist of four different sounds layered atop one another.
In such a case, you just reduced your polyphony by three-fourths, just
by using that one patch. If your synthesizer has 16-note polyphony, it’s
now down to 4-note polyphony because each of those 4 notes has four
“sounds” associated with it. If you use this patch, you can play only 4
notes (a simple chord) at a time, not the 16 that you thought you had to
work with.
Your best bet is to buy a synthesizer (or sound module) with the highest
polyphony you can get, especially if you want to layer one sound on top
of another or do multitimbral parts with your synth.

81
✦Multitimbrality: Most decent keyboards allow you to play more than
one sound patch at a time. This is multitimbrality, which basically allows
you to have your keyboard divided into several groups of sounds. For
example, a multitimbral synth can divide a song’s chords, melody, bass
part, and drum set sounds into different groups of sounds — and then
play all those groups at once.
If you do any sequencing (recording or playing back MIDI data), a 
multitimbral synthesizer is a must-have. Otherwise, you would need
a separate synthesizer for each type of sound that you want to play.
Fortunately, with the GM standards, compatible synthesizers made in
the last 15 years have the ability to play 16 sounds at once.
✦Keyboard feel: Some keyboards have weighted keys and feel like real
pianos, and other keyboards have a somewhat spongy action. If you’re a
trained piano player, a spongy keyboard might feel uncomfortable to
you. On the other hand, if you have no training in piano and don’t need
weighted keys, you don’t have to pay the extra money for that feature.
✦Sound quality: This is a subjective thing. Choose the synthesizer that
has the sounds you think you’ll use. I know this seems kind of obvious,
but buy the synthesizer whose sounds you like even if this means wait-
ing and saving the money before you can buy. If you buy a synthesizer
that was a good deal but don’t love the sounds, you’ve wasted your
money because you’ll just end up buying the more expensive one later.
✦Built-in sequencer: Many keyboards contain a built-in sequencer, which
allows you to program and play back your performance. Units like these
are usually called keyboard workstations or MIDI workstations because
they contain everything you need to create a song. If you’re considering
one of these complete workstations, take a good, hard look at the sequen-
cer and the user interface — make sure that you like the way those work
for you. Each manufacturer treats the process of sequencing a little dif-
ferently; you can probably find one that fits your style of working.
Drum machines
A drum machine contains the sounds of the drumset and other more exotic
drums as well as a sequencer to allow you to program rhythms. Figure 4-4
shows a typical drum machine.
Most drum machines contain hundreds of drum sounds, numerous preset
rhythm patches, and the ability to program dozens of songs. All standalone
drum machines have pads on which you can play the part. The more
advanced drum machines can give your rhythms a more human feel. Effects,
such as reverb and delay, are also fairly common on the more advanced
drum machines.

Getting Started with MIDI
82
Sound modules
A sound module is basically a stripped-down version of a synthesizer or
drum machine. Sound modules don’t contain triggering devices (such as the
keys for the keyboard, pickups for the guitar, or pads for the drum machine).
What they do contain are a variety of sounds (often hundreds) that a master
controller or sequencer can trigger. The advantage to sound modules is they
take up little space and cost considerably less than their fully endowed
counterparts (the synthesizers and drum machines, that is).
If you already have a master keyboard, you might find adding sound mod-
ules to be a cost- and space-effective way to add more sounds to your
system.
Samplers
A sampler is a sound module that contains short audio samples of real
instruments. Most samplers come with sound libraries containing hundreds
of different types of sounds, from acoustic pianos to snare drums to sound
effects. These sounds are often much more realistic than those that come in
some synthesizers.

The real purpose of a sampler is to allow you to record your own sounds.
For example, in the 1980s, it was cool to make a drumset from unusual per-
cussive sounds. A snare drum could be the sound of a flushing toilet (don’t
laugh, I actually did this) or breaking glass. Tom-toms could be grunts set 
to certain pitches. You’d be amazed at the strange stuff that people have
turned into music — all with the help of a sampler.
Another common use of a sampler is recording short sections of already
recorded songs. This can be a melodic or rhythmic phrase, a vocal cue, or a
single drum or synthesizer sound. Sampling other songs is common in elec-
tronic music, rap, and hip-hop (be careful of copyright issues before doing
this, however). If you’re into electronic music or hip-hop, you might find a
sampler a necessary addition to your studio.
Soft-synths
Because you’re using Pro Tools LE or Pro Tools M-Powered, your DAW
(Digital Audio Workstation) software enables you to produce great sounds
by using soft-synth plug-ins. Soft-synths are basically software equivalents of
standalone synthesizers, sound modules, or samplers. As you can see in
Figure 4-5, a soft-synth’s GUI (its graphical user interface, the smiley face that
the software shows the world) is often designed to look just like a piece of
regular hardware, complete with “buttons” and “knobs.”
Of course, soft-synths have their advantages and disadvantages:
✦Advantage: Soft-synths cost less than standalone units because no hard-
ware is involved.
✦Disadvantages: Unlike regular synthesizers, soft-synths use up proces-
sor power. This can slow down your computer system and prevent you
from recording as many audio tracks or applying as many effect patches
as you’d like. Another downside (depending on whom you talk to) is 
that soft-synth programs might not sound quite as good as an external
synthesizer.
Figure 4-5:

Countless soft-synth plug-ins are available for Pro Tools. Check out the
Digidesign compatibility page for programs that will work with the software
(www.digidesign.com/compato).
Sound cards
Most sound cards that you can put in your computer (or that come with a
computer) have General MIDI sounds in them. Depending on the quality of
your sound card, it may sound decent or border on unbearable.
To find out whether the GM sounds in your computer’s sound card are any
good, go ahead and play a MIDI file on your computer. First, do a search on
the Internet for MIDI files (just type MIDI into your favorite search engine).
Some sites require you to pay to download a song — especially for popular
or familiar tunes — but you can find many sites that allow you to choose a
song to listen to without downloading or paying a fee. Click a song, and it’ll
start playing automatically. You’ll immediately know whether you like the
sound of your sound card.
If you bought a new sound card for your computer to record audio with,
you’ll generally find that the sounds are pretty good. And (happily) with
your audio program, you also have access to soft-synth patches.
MIDI control this . . . 
MIDI controllers aren’t just limited to those that
you can find in your musical instrument store.
In fact, a MIDI controller can be just about any-
thing that you can imagine. Creative musicians
have come up with interesting MIDI controllers,
including body suits that allow you to tap on or
move your body to trigger sounds.
You, too, can make your own MIDI controller. All
you need is a little imagination and some basic
building and electronics skills. For example, one
of my first electronic drumsets consisted of
kitchen pots and pans fitted with electric pick-
ups routed to a Roland Octapad. This setup was
easy to make. First, I attached a piezoelectric
pickup (which cost about $1 from an electrical
supply company) to the inside of a pan with sil-
icon caulk. Then I connected the wires from the
pickup to a cord with a quarter-inch TS plug on
the end. I plugged the cord into the Octapad,
and when I hit the bottom of the pan, the
Octapad sent a MIDI message to my sampler.
You can attach these simple $1 piezoelectric
pickups to just about anything and trigger a
sound source. (You may need a device, such as
the Roland Octapad or other electronic drumset
module, to convert the signal from the piezo
pickup into MIDI messages.)

Book I

MIDI controllers
A MIDI controller is essentially what its name describes: a device that can
control another MIDI device. MIDI controllers come in many different for-
mats. In fact, a MIDI controller can be anything from a synthesizer to a drum
machine, or from a computer to a xylophone.
When MIDI first came out, your controller choice was limited to a keyboard,
but now you can choose between keyboards, wind controllers (for saxo-
phones or other wind instruments), guitars, or drums. So even if you don’t
play piano, you can find a controller that resembles an instrument you know
how to play. Look around, and you may find one (or more) MIDI controllers
that allow you to create music your way.
Sequencers
Although you can get standalone sequencers and sequencers integrated into
a synthesizer, you probably want to just use the sequencer in Pro Tools for
this. The reasons for this are many, but the overriding factor is that you can
have your MIDI and audio tracks in one place, and Pro Tools offers you more
powerful editing capabilities than a sequencer that’s contained in a box and
that uses a tiny LCD screen.
MIDI interfaces
The MIDI interface allows you to send and receive MIDI information from a
computer. All Digidesign interfaces — with the exception of the Mbox — have
a MIDI port. If you end up doing a lot of MIDI sequencing, though, and use
more than one sound module or external controller — or if you have the
Mbox — you need a separate MIDI interface, such as the one shown in 
Figure 4-6.
MIDI interfaces come in a staggering variety of configurations, so you have
several things to consider when you buy a MIDI interface. Use the following
questions to help you to determine your needs:
✦What type of computer do you own? MIDI interfaces are configured to
connect to a serial, parallel, or USB port. You determine which one to
use by the type of port(s) you have in your computer. For example, new
Macs have only a USB port although you can add a serial port if you
remove the internal modem. A PC has either a parallel port or a USB
port (sometimes both). PCs also have a joystick port, which accepts a
special MIDI joystick cable; no MIDI interface is needed.

Getting Started with MIDI
86
✦How many instruments do you intend to connect? MIDI interfaces
come with a variety of input and output configurations. There are
models with two In and two Out, four In and four Out, and even eight In
and eight Out. There are also “thru” boxes that have one or more inputs
and several outputs. If you have only one or two instruments, you can
get by with a smaller interface. In this case, a 2 x 2 interface — two In
and two Out — would work great. If you have many instruments that you
want to connect, you need a larger box.

 Looking at the various types of microphones
 Positioning microphones for the best sound
 Exploring a variety of preamps
 Taking care of your microphones
A
microphone’s job is generally to try to capture, as closely as possible,
the sound of an instrument. You can also use a microphone to infuse a
specific sound characteristic into a performance. Likewise, a preamp —
which boosts the signal of a microphone as it travels to the recorder — can
be used to accurately represent a sound or to add texture and dimension to
it. The fact is that microphones and preamps are the center of the sound
engineer’s palette. Just like a painter has his paints and brushes, you have
your microphones and preamps. And just like a painter can create a stun-
ning variety of visual textures with his tools, you, too, can make your cre-
ative statement with the judicious use of these two pieces of equipment.
In this chapter, you explore the two most versatile tools of your auditory
craft. You look at the various types of microphones and preamps, and you
gain an understanding of each one’s role in capturing a performance. You
also discover what types of mics and preamps work for particular situa-
tions. To top it off, this chapter guides you through purchasing and caring
for your precious new friends (mics and preamps, that is). You can find out
how to use your mics in Book III, Chapter 2, where I discuss specific mic
placement options.
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
When you start looking at microphones, you’ll find basically three different
types of construction methods (condenser, dynamic, ribbon) and three
basic polarity patterns (omnidirectional, figure-8, and cardioid). The follow-
ing sections explore these various constructions and patterns and helps you
make sense of them.

Meeting the Many Microphone Types
88
Construction types
Whether a microphone is a $10 cheapie that has a cord permanently
attached to it or a $15,000 pro model with gold-plated fittings, all micro-
phones convert sound waves to electrical impulses that the preamp or mixer
can read and the recorder can store. Each of the three main construction
types captures this auditory signal in a different way, and as such, each adds
certain characteristics to the sound. Here’s how the different mics affect
sound:
✦Condenser: Tends to have a well-rounded frequency response
✦Ribbon: Adds silkiness to the recorded sound because it rolls off the
higher frequencies slightly
✦Dynamic: Tends to accent the middle of the frequency spectrum
I detail these aspects in the following sections. In most cases, the type of
construction dictates the general cost category in which the mics fit.
Condenser microphones
A condenser microphone is, without a doubt, the most popular style of
microphone used in recording studios (home or commercial). Condenser
mics are sensitive and accurate, but they can also be expensive. Recently,
however, condenser mics have come down in cost, and you can buy a decent
one for less than $100. Very good ones start at about $500.
Condenser microphones have an extremely thin metal (or metal-coated plas-
tic or Mylar) diaphragm (the part that senses the signal). The diaphragm is
suspended in front of a metal plate (a backplate). Polarizing voltage is
applied to both the diaphragm and the backplate, creating a static charge in
the space between them. When the diaphragm picks up a sound, it vibrates
into the field between it and the backplate. This produces a small signal that
can then be amplified. Figure 5-1 shows how a condenser mic is constructed.
Condenser mics need a small amount of voltage (between 9 and 48 volts; V)
to function. If you use a condenser mic, make sure that it has its own internal
battery or that you have a preamp or mixer equipped with phantom power.
(Not sure what phantom power means? You’re in luck. The next section will
enlighten you.)
Phantom power
Phantom power is the small amount of voltage applied to run a condenser
microphone properly. In most cases, phantom power comes from your mixer
or preamp and is sent to the microphone through one of the wires in an XLR
cable. (I cover XLR cables in Chapter 3 of this mini-book.) Some condenser
mics have an internal battery or separate power supply that provides this
power.

Book I
Chapter 5
Understanding
Microphones
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
89
A switch, which is usually located on the preamp or mixer, enables you to
turn the phantom power off and on. Even though dynamic microphones
don’t use phantom power, this small amount of voltage doesn’t damage
them.
Tube or solid state
Condenser mics can be made with transistors (solid-state mics) or vacuum
tubes (tube mics). Like with all gear that offers a choice between tube and
solid state, base your decision on the sound characteristics that you prefer.
For the most part, tube condenser mics have a softer high end (although not
necessarily less high end) and a warmer overall tone. Solid-state mics, on
the other hand, are often more transparent: They capture the sound with less
coloration, sometimes with a bit greater clarity.
Large- or small-diaphragm
Condenser mics come in two broad categories: small diaphragm and large
diaphragm (see Figure 5-2). Large-diaphragm condenser mics are more popu-
lar than their small-diaphragm counterparts; they offer a more pronounced
bottom end (low frequencies). Large-diaphragm mics also make less self
noise, which is electronic noise created by the microphone.
Before you go out and buy only large-diaphragm mics, consider this: Small-
diaphragm condenser mics often have an even frequency response and can
more accurately capture instruments with a pronounced high-frequency
component (violins, for instance).

Dynamic microphones
Chances are you’ve had a chance to use a dynamic mic. Two hugely popular
Shure models characterize this type of mic — the SM57 and the SM58, which
has a silvery ball of gridded wire at one end and an XLR connector at the
other. Dynamic microphones have several qualities that make them unique.
First, they can handle a lot of volume (technically known as SPL, or Sound
Pressure Level), which makes them perfect for extremely loud signals, such
as drums, amplifiers, and some rock vocals. Dynamic mics are not as trans-
parent as condenser mics (they don’t represent high frequencies as accu-
rately), so they often impart a “dirty” or “gritty” sound to the signal.
The dynamic microphone uses a magnetic field to convert the sound
impulse from the diaphragm into electrical energy (as illustrated in 
Figure 5-3). The diaphragm, often made of plastic or Mylar, is located in front
of a coil of wire called a voice coil. The voice coil is suspended between two
magnets. When the diaphragm moves (the result of a sound), the voice coil
moves as well. The interaction between the voice coil’s movement and the
magnets creates the electrical signal.
Figure 5-2:
Condenser
mics can

small or
large
diaphragms.

Book I
Chapter 5
Understanding
Microphones
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
91
The sound of a dynamic mic can be described as somewhat boxy, meaning
that these mics don’t represent the highest or lowest frequencies of your
hearing spectrum accurately (not necessarily a bad thing). They are also
durable. Rough treatment probably won’t damage them much (aside from
the diaphragm, which a tough metal screen protects). Dynamic mics are the
type used most often for live shows. They tend to be inexpensive to buy and
easy to maintain; you can get a good dynamic mic for around $100.
Ribbon microphones
A ribbon microphone produces its sound in much the same way as a
dynamic mic. The diaphragm is suspended between two magnets. Ribbon
mics use a thin ribbon of aluminum (see Figure 5-4) instead of the plastic or
Mylar you’d find in a dynamic mic. Although ribbon mics were very popular
from around the 1930s to the 1960s, they’ve mostly taken a backseat to con-
denser mics in today’s studios. This is mainly because they are known to be
fragile and expensive, and aren’t as transparent as condenser mics. In fact, a
gust of wind or a strong breath into the diaphragm is all it takes to break a
ribbon mic.
Ribbon mics are experiencing a renaissance because a lot of recording engi-
neers are searching for a vintage sound. Ribbon mics have a unique sound
that is often described as silky or smooth. This essentially means that the
high frequencies tend to roll off (gradually reduce) slightly, and the lower fre-
quencies smear together a bit.
Until very recently, ribbon mics were fairly expensive. You’d have been hard
pressed to find a new one for much less than $1,000. Nowadays, you can find
some for just a few hundred dollars.

Polarity patterns
Microphones pick up sounds in different ways, which are known as polarity
patterns. Here’s how the various patterns work:
✦Omnidirectional mics can capture sounds all around them.
✦Cardioid (or directional) mics pick up sounds just in front of them.
✦Figure-8 (or bidirectional) mics pick up sounds from both the front and
back.
Omnidirectional
An omnidirectional mic can pick up sounds coming from anywhere around 
it. Omnidirectional mics are useful for situations where you want to capture
not only the source sound, but also the sound of the room it’s coming from.
You can find omnidirectional mics used in stereo pairs, suspended over

drumsets to capture the whole sound of the kit, or used overhead to pick 
up groups of acoustic instruments (such as orchestras).
Omnidirectional mics are not generally used for close miking — placing the
mic less than a foot from the sound source — because they tend to catch too
much background noise. You can see the pick-up pattern of an omnidirec-
tional mic in Figure 5-5. The round pattern shows that the mic picks up
sound from all directions.
Cardioid
Cardioid microphones pick up the sound in front of them and reject any
sounds that come from behind. Cardioid mics are the most common for live
bands because you can control the sound that they pick up. If you have a car-
dioid mic on the tom-tom of a drumset, for example, the mic picks up only the
sound of that drum and not the sound from the other instruments around it.

The three types of cardioid microphones are cardioid, super-cardioid, and
hyper-cardioid. The differences among the types of cardioid patterns of each
mic aren’t that great. Check out the graphs in Figure 5-6 to see how the
polarity patterns of cardioid microphones differ.
Generally, you don’t need to think about the minor polarity-pattern differ-
ences among the types of cardioid mics when you buy or use a microphone.
You won’t notice the practical differences in the way these three types of
mics work.
Figure-8
Figure-8 mics (also called bidirectional) pick up sound from both the front
and back, but not all the way around. If you take a look at the graph in 
Figure 5-7, you can see that sound is not effectively picked up from areas 
on either side of the microphone.
Figure-8 mics are often used to record two instruments simultaneously. For
example, you can place the microphone between two horn players with the
side of the mic perpendicular to the players. This allows you to capture both
instruments while eliminating any sound in front of the musicians.
Most figure-8 condenser mics have the same frequency response for both
the front and back sides, but some ribbon mics produce very different
responses that depend on whether the sound is coming from the front or the
back. For instance, a Royer r121 ribbon mic picks up more high frequencies
from behind the mic than from in front. You can use this to your advantage
when recording an instrument. If the sound is too rich in low frequencies,
just turn the mic around a little — or a lot, depending on how much of the
high frequencies you want to add. (More on this in Book III, Chapter 2.)

Multiple-pattern mics
Some condenser microphones can change their pick-up patterns. You can
choose from cardioid, omni, or figure-8 (as in Figure 5-8). These mics (gener-
ally, large diaphragm) can do this trick because they usually contain two
sets of diaphragms and backplates, positioned back to back. You might want
to have at least one multiple-pattern mic around to give you more variety in
microphone positions.
The omni pattern in a multiple-pattern microphone works (and sounds) dif-
ferently from a true omnidirectional mic. For critical applications (recording
an orchestra, for instance), you might find that a multiple-pattern mic is not
a fair substitute for an exclusively omnidirectional mic.

Buying the Right Microphone for You
Buying microphones is, without a doubt, one of the most critical decisions
that you’ll make when setting up your home studio. Using the right micro-
phone for the job can mean the difference between an okay track and a truly
spectacular one.
As recently as just a few years ago, your choice in microphones was between
inexpensive dynamic mics (what most home recordists could afford) and
expensive condenser or ribbon mics (what the pro studios had). But, as luck
would have it, you’ve entered a time in home recording where your options
are much more diverse. In fact, a whole line of project-studio mics has
recently emerged. This is a new market that manufacturers have found to be
hugely profitable, so the choices are expanding almost daily. In some cases,
a $400 project-studio mic can rival a $2,000-plus pro mic — at least for the
home recordist’s purposes.
So the question that you’re inevitably going to ask is, “What microphones
should I get for my home studio?” Good question. And the answer is, “Well, it
depends on what you need.” So before I go into detail about what mics might

be best for you, try to spend a minute assessing your needs. These ques-
tions might help you figure out your needs:
✦What type of music will I record? If you play rock or pop music, you
probably want to start with dynamic mics because they’re inexpensive
and because their limitations in high or low frequencies don’t matter as
much as they would if you want to record your string quartet. In this
case, a pair of condenser mics would do the trick.
✦What instruments will I record? Loud amps, drums, and screaming
singers beg to be recorded with dynamic mics, whereas light percussion,
vocals, and stand-up basses shine through with large-diaphragm con-
denser mics.
✦How many mics will I use at once? If you need to record your whole
band at once, budget constraints might dictate your choice between
dynamic and condenser mics or a condenser or ribbon mic for vocals. If
you need only a couple of mics to record the occasional vocal or instru-
ment, you can invest more in each mic.
How many, what kind
You will likely build your microphone collection over time rather than
buying all your mics at once. This is the best way to buy mics because it
gives you time to develop an understanding of what you can do with the
microphone that you have before you plunk down your money for another.
You’re better off having a few mics that best fit your situation rather than a
whole bunch of mics that just sorta work for you.
If you’re like most people, your budget dictates how many mics you can buy
and what kind they might be. In this section, I try to help you get the best
mics for your recording needs and guide you through the process of slowly
accumulating microphones.
Before you go out and buy a ton of mics, know this: Many digital systems
have an effect called a mic simulator — a program that allows you to use a
relatively inexpensive mic and get the sound of a much more expensive one.
If your system has a mic simulator program (you can find out by searching
through your system’s effects patches), I recommend getting a basic dynamic
mic first. You might find that you like how the mic simulator sounds and dis-
cover that you don’t need as many mics as you thought.
Getting started
A basic mic setup consists of a couple of dynamic mics for drums, guitar
amps, or other loud instruments; and a decent condenser mic for vocals or
other acoustic instruments. You can buy a good, sturdy all-around dynamic
mic for under $100; a lower-end (but nice-sounding) condenser mic costs
around $200.

Buying the Right Microphone for You
98
For most home recordists, a large-diaphragm condenser mic is the first con-
denser mic. These are good all-around mics that can work well for a lot of
applications.
Movin’ on
After you have your basic mics, you can start to add a few more. If you
intend to record your band, you need to at least mic the drumset. (Four 
mics will get you around the set.) In this case, you can add a couple more
dynamic mics and start thinking about getting one or two that are designed
for particular applications. For instance, you can find mics on the market
that are made to work best on the kick drum of a drumset.
At this point, you can also get a second condenser mic — maybe a small-
diaphragm condenser mic this time or a large-diaphragm tube condenser.
You might want to choose one that sounds different from the one you
already have — or, if you love the one you have, you can get a second one
just like it so you have a stereo pair.
Going all out
As your mic collection grows, you’ll probably start looking for a vocal mic
that works best for your voice. In this case, you might consider large-
diaphragm tube condenser mics or even a ribbon mic.
After this, your next step might be to buy a stereo pair of omnidirectional
mics for drum overheads (mics placed over the drum set) or other multi-
instrument applications.
Detailing applications
Certain mics work better than others for particular situations. In this sec-
tion, I try to present some typical applications to give you an idea of what
types of mics are traditionally used for various purposes. (You can find more
ideas about mic usage in Book III, Chapter 2, where I discuss specific miking
techniques.)
When you consider a mic, think about the frequency spectrum of the instru-
ment(s) you’re recording. If you use a dynamic mic for a symphonic orches-
tra performance, for example, you’ll be disappointed by the results because
it lacks an accurate high-frequency response. On the other hand, using a
small-diaphragm condenser mic on the tom-toms of a drum set makes them
sound thin and is a waste of money because you can get by with a much less
expensive dynamic mic for this purpose.

Book I
Chapter 5

99
Microphone choice is fairly subjective. The following list contains some
basic suggestions, based on what’s typically used in the recording industry.
You might choose a different type of mic, especially if you try to create a cer-
tain effect. For instance, using a ribbon mic rather than a small-diaphragm
condenser mic on a metallic shaker softens the highest frequencies of the
instrument and gives it a mellower sound.
✦Vocals: Most people prefer the sound of a large-diaphragm condenser
mic for vocals. If you have the budget, you might also want to audition
some ribbon mics for your voice. A dynamic mic is best when you’re
going for a dirty or raw sound (excellent for some harder rock, blues, or
punk music) or if your singer insists on screaming into the mic. A small-
diaphragm condenser mic, rarely the first choice for most singers, isn’t
out of the question for some female vocalists if you don’t mind a bright,
present sound (reduced low-frequency content).
✦Electric guitar amp: A dynamic mic or a small-diaphragm condenser
works well on an electric guitar amp. Some people use large-diaphragm
condenser mics on guitar amps and like the added low frequencies that
can result.
✦Electric bass amp: Your first choice when miking an amplified electric
bass is either a large-diaphragm condenser mic or a dynamic mic. Either
one can capture the frequency spectrum that the bass guitar encom-
passes. Small-diaphragm condenser mics aren’t a good choice because
of their inherent high frequency focus.
✦Acoustic guitar and other stringed instruments: A large- or small-
diaphragm condenser mic or a ribbon mic works well in most instances.
A dynamic mic has too limited of a frequency response to create a natu-
ral sound but might create an effect that you like. Choose the large- or
small-diaphragm based upon the overall frequency spectrum of the
instrument. For example, if you want to capture the depth of a guitar’s
tone, choose a large-diaphragm mic. For an instrument with a higher reg-
ister, such as a violin or mandolin, a small-diaphragm mic works great.
✦Drumset: Tom-toms, snare drums, and kick (bass) drums all sound good
with dynamic mics because they don’t put out any high frequencies. You
can also use large-diaphragm condenser mics, but be careful where you
place them because if your drummer hits them, they’re toast.
✦Cymbals: For the cymbals of a drum set, a pair of small-diaphragm con-
denser mics works well although some people prefer to use large-
diaphragm mics instead. Many old-timers are using ribbon mics on
cymbals when they record digitally to give the cymbals a softer sound. A
dynamic mic would lack the high-frequency response needed to make
the cymbals shine through in a mix.
✦Miscellaneous percussion: Now, here’s a broad category. By miscella-
neous, I mean shakers, triangles, maracas, and other higher-pitched per-
cussion toys. For these instruments, you’ll find that either small- or

Buying the Right Microphone for You
100
large-diaphragm condenser mics work well. For a very quiet instrument,
such as a small shaker, a large-diaphragm mic is preferable because of
the higher self noise of the small-diaphragm mic.
If you intend to record loud instruments — drums, amplified guitars, or
basses — look for a mic with a high SPL (a rating of how much volume, in
decibels [dB], that the microphone can handle before distorting). A high SPL
is more than 130 dB.
Some professional condenser mics have a pad switch that allows you to
reduce the sensitivity of the mic, thereby increasing how well it can handle
high sound-pressure levels.
Partnering with preamps
One of the most important relationships in your home studio is the one
between your microphones and the preamp — the nice bit of hardware that
boosts the mic’s signal so it can be recorded. The greatest microphone in
the world is wasted if it’s run through a cheap preamp. By the same token, a
cheap mic plugged in to a great preamp sounds only as good as the bad mic.
Your Digidesign hardware comes with at least two preamps. (Book II,
Chapter 2 details each piece of hardware.) This might be enough for you, but
you might want a separate preamp for a different (better) sound or if you
need more inputs than your hardware provides.
For the most part, the preamps in the Digidesign hardware are more than
adequate until your engineering skills are way up there. I recommend using
them and spending your money on some decent mics first (unless, of course,
you need more preamps than those that come with your hardware).
You can find three types of preamps in the marketplace — solid-state,
vacuum tube, and hybrid — and each has its own characteristics. In the fol-
lowing sections, you get a chance to explore some preamp styles and dis-
cover how each relates to the sounds produced by the types of microphones
I discuss earlier in the chapter. This can help you start considering the rela-
tionship between the microphone and preamp in your studio.
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone.
Solid-state preamps can be designed to produce as clear and detailed (that
is, transparent) of a sound as possible or can be designed to create a pleasing
level of distortion (warmth) for your music. Solid-state preamps cost any-
where from a couple hundred to several thousand dollars.

Book I
Chapter 5
Understanding
Microphones
Buying the Right Microphone for You
101
A good clean, clear, solid-state preamp (such as those from Earthworks or
George Massenburg Labs) is a great choice if you want as natural of a sound
as possible on your recording of an instrument or if you’re using a micro-
phone that has a sound quality that you want to hear as clearly as possible.
For example, I particularly like how a solid-state preamp works in conjunc-
tion with a tube condenser or ribbon mic. The warmth and smoothness of
these types of microphones shines through clearly with a clean solid-state
preamp.
On the other hand, a more aggressive (warm or pleasingly distorted) solid-
state preamp, such as those modeled after the classic Neve designs, can add
just a touch of “grit” to certain instruments. These types of preamps are
great with dynamic, ribbon, or condenser mics, especially when recording
drums, guitar, and some vocals.
Tube
Tube preamps use vacuum tubes to process and amplify the microphone’s
signal. This generally adds some coloration to the sound of your mic,
although how much and what kind of coloration depends on the particular
preamp. As you’ve undoubtedly discovered after reading any other chapter
in this book, digital recording aficionados love the sound of tube gear, espe-
cially tube preamps. The advantage with a tube preamp is that it can add a
nice warm sound to your mics. The disadvantage is that you often can’t get
rid of this colored sound. Professional recording engineers often have sev-
eral tube preamps in their studios to give them different coloration options.
The preamps included in your mixer are solid state. If you find that you want
the colored sound of a tube preamp, you have to buy an external one.
Tube preamps are great for imparting a subtle low-frequency addition to the
sound of the microphone signal. Tube preamps also seem to soften the
higher frequencies slightly. If you’re like most people, you’ll find the addition
of a tube preamp to be welcome, especially if you intend to record rock,
blues, or acoustic jazz music. The downside is that all-tube preamps are
expensive, with the least expensive costing about $1,000 (the Peavey VMP-2:
a nice-sounding preamp that you’ll have to find on the used market) and
most running several thousand dollars (for brands such as Manley Labs).
I prefer to use tube preamps with drums and any “woody” instrument
(acoustic guitar, for instance). In this case, I often find myself reaching for a
large-diaphragm condenser mic. And, in extreme cases, I might even use a
large-diaphragm tube condenser mic with the tube preamp (for an extra
dose of “tubiness”).

Buying the Right Microphone for You
102
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components to boost the
mic’s signal. Most of the inexpensive (less than $1,000) tube preamps that
you find in the marketplace are actually hybrids. An advantage to this design
approach is that the preamp can often be adjusted to give you varying
degrees of that warm tube sound. The disadvantage is that these relatively
inexpensive tube preamps won’t have as clear a sound as a great solid-state
preamp, and they won’t have quite the same pleasing character as an expen-
sive all-tube preamp.
For most home recordists, this type of preamp offers a lot of flexibility and
can allow you to get either a fairly clear, open sound of a solid-state preamp
or a warm, colored sound characteristic of a classic tube preamp. If you can
afford only one external preamp, you might find a great solution in one of
these hybrid versions.
The countless hybrid preamps on the market vary widely. (In fact, most 
of the hybrid preamps are actually marketed as tube preamps.) Your best
bet in choosing a hybrid (or any preamp, for that matter) is to do some
research. Talk to people, read reviews, visit Internet forums, and then audi-
tion the two or three that stand out to you. Choose the one that you think
sounds best for your needs.
Considering compressors
You use a compressor to alter the dynamic range of an instrument. Along
with the microphone and preamp, a compressor is often added to the signal
chain before it goes to the mixer. The advantage of using a compressor in the
signal chain before it hits the mixer is that you can control the transients of
an instrument so it doesn’t overload your converters and create digital 
distortion.
The compressor plug-ins in Pro Tools are of no use to you if you want to con-
trol the transients of an instrument because they are located after the con-
verters. If you don’t want to use (or can’t afford) an external compressor,
keep your input level down a bit when you record. (Book III, Chapter 3
covers setting levels in detail.)
If you record a lot of vocals or real drums, consider using a decent external
compressor. You can find some great-sounding compressors for as little as
$200. (Check out my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com for some great
bang-for-your-buck compressor finds.)

Preamp, compressor, and equalizer combos
As long as you’re looking at preamps and compressors, take a look at channel-
strip devices — combos that integrate preamp, compressor, and equalizer.
For some people (maybe you), a channel-strip device is the way to go. Using
just one unit cuts down on the number of cords, and it’s designed to make
the three parts function well together. Quite a few great-sounding channel-
strip devices are available for less than $500.
Analyzing some microphone accessories
Along with your new mics, you’re going to need a few accessories. These
include mic cords, stands, and pop filters.
Microphone cords
Microphone cords can cost anywhere from about $10 to several hundred
dollars. You’re probably asking yourself, “Is there really a difference between
a $10 or $20 mic cable and one that sells for hundreds of dollars?”
My answer is, “Supposedly, but chances are, you’ll never hear it.” Let me
qualify this answer a little. Unless you have very good microphones, pre-
amps, A/D (analog-to-digital) and D/A (digital-to-analog) converters, mixer,
recorder, and monitors, you’re wasting your money on expensive micro-
phone cords. I know only one sound engineer (not me, though — I’ve spent
too many years behind the drums) who claims that he can actually hear the
difference between an average mic cord and one of the expensive ones. And
he says that the difference is very subtle. (It would have to be; otherwise, I’d
hear the difference, too.)
Don’t waste your money on an expensive mic cord (or any cord) until you’ve
got such kickin’ equipment that the cord is the weakest link in your signal
chain. By then, spending a couple hundred dollars on a cord will seem like
pennies because you’ll already have invested tens of thousands of dollars in
top-quality gear.
Stands
A sturdy stand is essential if you intend to mic anything in your studio.
Studio mics can get a bit cumbersome, and decent mic stands are relatively
inexpensive, so try to resist the temptation to buy a flimsy stand. A good mic
stand has a sturdy base and can securely hold your mics.
Good mic stands cost about $30 and have either a round, cast-iron base
(great for getting into tight spaces) or a tripod base (superior stability).
Either one works well. Check out Figure 5-9 to see these two types of stands.

Caring for Your Microphones
104
Pop filters
A pop filter is a nylon screen that is used to eliminate the “pops” (technically
called plosives) that singers make when they sing. Plosives are the result of
sudden bursts of air projected into the mic (from singing words starting with
Ps and Ts, for example). If you record vocals, a pop filter is a must-have.
Pop filters are relatively inexpensive, but if you want to make your own, you
can with a pair of tights or pantyhose and a coat hanger. Bend the coat
hanger into a circle and stretch the nylons or pantyhose over it. You can
attach the coat hanger to the mic stand with duct tape. Adjust it so the pop
filter is about four to six inches away from the microphone and have the
singer sing through it. Check out Figure 5-10 for a look at a homemade pop
filter.
Caring for Your Microphones
After investing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in microphones, you
probably want to know how to take care of them properly. Caring for or stor-
ing your microphones isn’t rocket science. Just follow the general guidelines
and ideas that follow, and you’ll keep your mics in tip-top shape.

A good microphone lasts a lifetime. Take care of your mics, and they’ll offer
you years of service.
Daily care for your mics
Probably the most important thing to keep in mind when using your mics 
is to resist the temptation to blow into them. I know you’ve probably seen
the doof on stage blow into a mic and yell, “Test! Is this thing on?” to see
whether it’s working. And some folks figure that’s how the pros must check
their mics. Well, it isn’t. Blowing into a mic is one of the worst ways to test 
it — and for some sensitive models (like those expensive ribbon mics), it’s a
sure way to literally blow the diaphragm. If you want to check to see
whether a mic is working, just speak into it in a normal voice.
Never blow or yell into any mic unless your singer’s style is to yell into the
mic and you’re trying to set the input level. In this case, offer him your trusty
dynamic mic and keep that expensive ribbon mic hidden.
Figure 5-10:

Caring for Your Microphones
106
Another thing to keep in mind when handling your mics is that they can be
fragile. Condenser and ribbon mics don’t survive rough handling well. In
fact, if you drop a condenser or ribbon mic, you might just break it. (This is
why you need a sturdy stand.) Dynamic mics, on the other hand, are more
durable, which is why they are often used for live applications and on drums
(where it’s not uncommon for an overzealous drummer to whack them by
accident — as a drummer, I know about this firsthand).
Keep your mics away from dust and high humidity. Dust is probably the
number-one enemy of a microphone; it can settle on the diaphragm and
lessen the sensitivity of the mic — even alter its frequency response. Always
cover your mics or put them away when you’re not using them.
Storing your mics
Most professionals have mic lockers where they can safely keep the mics
that aren’t in use. Mic lockers come in different forms. You can make a spe-
cial locked box fitted with foam padding that has a cutout for each mic, or
you can keep your mics in their pouches or cases (if they came with them)
in a closet or cabinet.
Regardless of the type of storage cabinet you have, try to handle your mics as
little as possible. In fact, if you have a mic that you use a lot, you’re often
better off leaving it on a secure stand between sessions instead of dragging it
in and out of its case or storage cabinet.
If you do leave your mic out on its stand when it’s not in use, cover it with a
plastic bag and close the open end around the mic. (See Figure 5-11.) This
keeps off the dust.
Humidity can also be a problem for microphones. If you live in a humid envi-
ronment, store your mics with a bag of silica gel next to them. (Silica gel —
the stuff that comes in the packaging of a lot electronic gear — absorbs
moisture.) You can find silica gel listed as desiccant packets (Desi Pak) by the
manufacturer. You can order silica gel in quantities as little as ten from

ro Tools works well on both Macs and PCs, so no matter which type of
computer you prefer, you can make good music without much hassle.
However, you need to do a few things to your computer — and certain hard-
ware requirements you need to observe — to run Pro Tools successfully.
This chapter gets you up to speed on these areas. I walk you through setting
up and configuring your system and installing the software. As an added
attraction, I include some advice on how to keep the bugs at bay. (You know,
those nasty computer hiccups that can keep you from capturing your best
guitar solo — or, worse yet, losing it after the fact.)
Using Pro Tools on a Mac
Getting up and going on a Mac is easy. After you have a computer with the
right specs (which I cover in this section), it takes you less than 15 minutes
to be ready to plug in your hardware (covered in Chapter 2 of this mini-
book) and start recording (covered in Book III). This section takes you step
by step, turning your Mac into a lean, mean, audio recording machine.
Understanding Mac system requirements
One of the great things about Macintosh computers is that there aren’t a lot
of variables. Almost any Mac can record audio with Pro Tools. (Well, as long
as it meets the basic system requirements. See the following Remember
icon.) Here are a few things, however, that you need to know to record well.
These are covered in this section.

Using Pro Tools on a Mac
112
The best way to ensure that the computer you own or are considering
buying will work with Pro Tools and the Digidesign hardware that you want
is to go to the compatibility page on the Digidesign Web site at
www.digidesign.com/compato
Choose the hardware and operating system (OS) you use (or intend to use)
to see whether it will work with Pro Tools.
Because the people at Digidesign can’t test all possible hardware options,
you might also want to check out the Digidesign User Conference (DUC) for
any topics covering hardware issues. That Web page is http://duc.
digidesign.com. Look for the section dedicated to Pro Tools for Macs.
Knowing which Mac to buy
For the most part, almost any G4 or newer Mac will work, including a
PowerBook, a G4 with an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) graphics card,
and most G5s. (The newest ones often take a few weeks for Digidesign to add
to its list of compatible computers.) In addition, iMacs, iBooks, and Mac mini
might work, but always check out the compatibility documents for the 
hardware and OS you intend to use (via the Digidesign Web site at www.
digidesign.com/compato).
The Digidesign interface you have dictates what type of computer you can
use. For example, if you have a Digi 001, you need a computer with an open
Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) slot. This eliminates everything
except the G4. The G5 is off the list, too, because it uses a PCI configuration
that’s incompatible with the Digi 001. The Digi 002 and 002 Rack both require
a FireWire port on the computer, which will work with just about all the
newer Macs. The Mbox uses a USB connection, so make sure that your com-
puter of choice has at least one USB port; they all should.
Opting for a Mac operating system
You need at least Mac OS X version 10.3.9 (Panther) to run version 7 or
newer Pro Tools software. Some minor issues occurred with v. 10.4.9 when it
first came out, so you definitely want to check out the Digidesign compatibil-
ity page to see whether any issues are noted for the Mac OS you have.
I try to stay one version behind with all my software, especially the OS. I’ve
learned the hard way to wait until the bugs are worked out before upgrading.
One nice thing about Digidesign is that it constantly checks and approves
the newest hardware and OS versions so you don’t to do it yourself. So, I’d
stay with Tiger (10.4) for a while until Leopard (10.5) is firmly in the compati-
bility list.

Recognizing your RAM needs
Pro Tools requires at least 768MB of RAM for basic operation and at least
1.5GB of RAM if you run the DV Toolkit or Music Production Toolkit options,
but I say go for broke here. Get as much RAM as you can afford or as your
computer can handle. And don’t buy the cheap stuff — get high-quality RAM.
It’s worth checking out www.crucial.com to find the best RAM for your
system.
Getting a handle on hard drives
Pro Tools (and any other audio-recording software for that matter) likes to
have more than one hard drive. In fact, I’ll go as far as to say that Pro Tools
needs more than one hard drive to run properly. My advice? Get two drives:
one drive for all your system files and software, and the other for all your
audio and MIDI files. Here’s a look at how to organize them:
✦Drive 1: This is the system drive. For your system drive, you can use the
stock drive that came with your computer. If you have a choice, though,
I recommend getting one with a spindle speed of 7,200 rpm. You’ll be
much happier, as will Pro Tools. And get a big one — hard drive, that is
(at least 120GB).
Even if you have other programs on your computer (such as finance or
word processing software), you don’t need to partition your drive. In
fact, doing so might slow down your system.
✦Drive 2: This is the audio drive. It used to be that you needed a good,
high-speed SCSI drive to record and playback audio reliably, but this
isn’t the case anymore. You can use both IDE and FireWire drives for
storing audio. Just make sure that you have a drive with the following
(or better) specs:
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at which
the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200 rpm drive works well
for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time that it takes the drive to find
the data that’s stored on it. You want an average seek time under 10
milliseconds (ms). Get as low as you can. (I prefer a seek time of 8 
to 9 ms.)
• Buffer size: Often called a cache buffer, buffers are memory units that
store data while it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at
least 2MB, but get one as big as you can. I recommend a drive with
an 8MB buffer.

Using Pro Tools on a Mac

• Chipset: If you use a FireWire 800 drive, make sure that it comes with
at least the Oxford 911 bridge chipset. This is necessary to get the
most bandwidth from the drive and results in more tracks in your
session.
A drive with these specs in a good size (100GB or so) will run you about
$100, so you have no reason not to spring for the second drive.
Dealing with other software on your system
Not too long ago, installing any other software on the computer that you
intended to record audio into was asking for trouble. This isn’t a problem so
much anymore, but you still need to be careful not to stress your system by
putting too much junk on your computer. (Games come to mind.)
As an experiment, I had Pro Tools running while I had both my e-mail and
Internet browser program open and downloading files, as well as Photoshop
and MS Word running (talk about multitasking!) — and Pro Tools still ran
fine. I wouldn’t try to record or mix seriously with all this stuff going, but I
was able to work without my system crashing.
With that said, if you’re really serious about having a bulletproof system, try
to keep any extra software (such as games, finance, publishing, graphics,
and so on) off your audio computer. At the very least, keep all other applica-
tions closed while you work in Pro Tools.
Setting system settings
Before you install Pro Tools software, check to make sure that you have the
latest version of OS X. (Also check the Digidesign compatibility Web page to
make sure this version is supported.) Then follow these steps to prepare
your system for the software installation (these steps refer to version 10.4.9):
1. Log on to your computer by using an administration account.
Your OS X documentation will spell out this procedure for you.
2. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 1-1.
3. Under the Hardware Options, click the Energy Saver icon.
A new window opens.
4. On the Sleep tab, move the slider for Put the Computer to Sleep When
It Is Inactive For option over to Never, as shown in Figure 1-2.

This keeps your computer from shutting down if you record a long song
because you don’t touch any keys while recording.
5. Leave the Put the Hard Disk to Sleep When Possible option unchecked.
This keeps your computer from going to sleep during long sessions.
6. Go back to the main Systems Preferences page by clicking the Show
All button in the upper-left corner of the window.
7. Choose Software Update from the System options at the bottom of the
page.
8. When the new window opens, deselect the Automatically Check for
Updates When You Have a Network Connection option, as shown in
Figure 1-3.
This keeps your system from dedicating resources to look for and down-
load software updates when you’re working.

Installing the program
After you complete the system setup requirements in the previous section,
you can install Pro Tools software by following these steps:
1. Insert the Pro Tools software CD in your computer’s CD drive.
2. In the new window that appears, double-click the Install Pro Tools
icon.
The OS X Administration window appears, asking you to enter your
password.
3. Enter your OS X Administration password and then click OK.
The Pro Tools installer opens.
4. Select the Startup hard drive as the destination drive.
The installation path is set.
5. Click Install.
Pro Tools installs on your computer. This might take a few minutes, so
sit back and contemplate the fun you’re going to have after it finishes
installing itself.
6. Restart your computer.
Wait to open the program until after you attach your hardware. The com-
plete details for this procedure are located in Chapter 2 of this mini-book.

Using Pro Tools on a PC
Getting set up with a PC is a little more complicated than it is with a Mac
simply because you have a lot more hardware variables to deal with. As long
as you keep the basic system requirements in mind, you can set yourself up
a very powerful system, often for less money than you’d shell out for a com-
parable Mac-based system. In this section, I cover some basic things to keep
in mind when you’re either purchasing or configuring a PC system for use
with Pro Tools.
Understanding PC system requirements
Although the system requirements for PCs are similar to the basic ones for
Macs, you do have to deal with a ton more variables. Of these variables, cen-
tral processing units (CPUs), motherboards, and graphics cards are proba-
bly the most confusing to people starting out. These components — as well
as the more basic stuff, such as hard drives and RAM — are covered in this
section so you can get up and running on a PC in no time.
Again, the best source for the latest hardware compatibility information can
be found online at the Digidesign Web site at
www.digidesign.com/compato
or on the Digidesign User’s Conference (DUC) Web page at
http://duc.digidesign.com
At the DUC Web page, look for the section dedicated to Pro Tools LE for PCs.
At the top of that forum — Pro Tools LE Windows Systems: 003, 002, Mbox,
001 — you’ll find two very useful threads that contain a wealth of informa-
tion about user-tested system configurations that are known to work well:
✦Best Desktops for PTLE
✦Best Laptops for PTLE
Picking a central processing unit (CPU)
A CPU is a small chip that’s responsible for processing all the data in your
computer. It’s essentially the computer’s brain. The two major CPU manufac-
turers in the PC world are Intel and AMD. Digidesign supports both, and
each can work fine as the core of your Pro Tools host computer. For Intel
systems, I recommend going with a Pentium 4 or the Core2Duo; for AMD sys-
tems, go with an Athlon 64.

Using Pro Tools on a PC
118
Because Pro Tools is a host-based system, it relies on the processing power
of your computer’s CPU instead of hardware-processing cards (like the more
elaborate Pro Tools HD systems do). The number of plug-ins and amount of
mix automation you can use in a session is directly related to how powerful
(read: fast) your system is, so don’t skimp on CPU speed. The good news is
that the current higher-end processors are able to perform as well, if not
better than, the super-expensive Pro Tools HD systems.
Choosing a motherboard
A motherboard is the main circuit board in your computer, holding the CPU,
memory, and other peripheral cards. The motherboard you choose depends
on whether you run an Intel or AMD CPU. (See the previous section for more
on both brands.) Each CPU type has its own motherboard requirements, and
many choices are available for each, with new motherboards being released
all the time. I have had good results over the years with Asus brand mother-
boards, but other brands can also work well.
When you select a motherboard for use with Pro Tools, your main concern is
that it
✦Supports the CPU you plan on using
✦Has a compatible chipset
Be sure to check out the compatibility site before you buy a motherboard.
Grabbing a graphics card
Pro Tools doesn’t make the same demands on your graphics card that
modern game software does. The main thing to consider is that the graphics
card you use is compatible with your motherboard. In most cases, this isn’t
an issue, but check it out anyway as a hedge against Murphy’s Law.
Pro Tools is not compatible with Northbridge (integrated) graphics con-
trollers. You need a dedicated graphics controller. In a desktop computer,
this essentially means that you have a separate graphics card inserted into
either the AGP or PCI-E (PCI-Express) slot. (PCI and PCI-X cards are not sup-
ported in Pro Tools.)
When purchasing a laptop, you have the option to choose to upgrade from
an integrated graphics controller. Here how to find out whether your com-
puter has an integrated graphics controller:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪System.
2. On the System Properties dialog box that opens, click the 
Hardware tab.

Book II
Chapter 1
Configuring Your

Using Pro Tools on a PC
119
3. On the Hardware tab, click the Device Manager button.
From the Device Manager window that opens, select Display Adapters
from the tree (see Figure 1-4).
Make sure that the display adapter doesn’t read Integrated. If it does,
you need to install a dedicated graphics controller or upgrade to a
newer computer. You can find out more about this by going to
www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=100&navid=54&itenid=24903
Loading up on RAM
As far as RAM goes, Digidesign suggests using a minimum of 768MB unless
you’re using DV Toolkit or Music Production Toolkit options. In those cases,
you need at least 1GB of RAM. As I mention in earlier chapters, get a lot more
RAM — at least double the minimum amount. The other important thing to
remember when buying RAM for your PC is that you get the proper type of
RAM for your motherboard.
Don’t buy cheap RAM because it can cause problems with your system.
High-quality RAM is not much more expensive than the cheap stuff, so spend
the extra few bucks. You’ll thank me when your system doesn’t freeze on
you. As I mention in the earlier Mac section, I recommend checking out
www.crucial.com to find the best RAM for your system.

Selecting hard drives
Hard drive requirements for a PC system are essentially the same as those
for Macs. Check out the “Getting a handle on hard drives” section earlier in
this chapter for the lowdown on buying hard drives for your system.
Opting for a Windows operating system
Windows XP (Home or Professional) is required for all the newer Digidesign
hardware (anything newer than the Digi 001). This includes the Mbox, 002,
and 003. As of this writing, Vista (the latest Microsoft OS) isn’t yet sup-
ported, but by the time you read this book, it will likely be pretty stable. At
the risk of belaboring a point, check the Digidesign compatibility page to see
what OSes are approved for your hardware and software version.
Preparing to install Pro Tools software
Before you can actually install your Pro Tools software, you need to get your
system configured for it. This section describes the procedures and helps
you make sure that your system will run trouble-free (at least as much as can
be expected).
Windows settings
Although it’s true for the most part that you can run Pro Tools just fine on a
standard Windows XP configuration, a few system adjustments will free up
system resources, allowing more of your computer system’s power available
for use by Pro Tools. This is important because Pro Tools is a native DAW
(Digital Audio Workstation) — one that relies solely on the host computer’s
processing power with no additional DSP (Digital Signal Processing) cards
for support. And some of these adjustments — such as enabling DMA (Direct
Memory Access) for all your IDE hard drives — are crucial for running Pro
Tools successfully. The sections that follow lay out the basic system settings
that I recommend.
Windows XP Classic mode
You can accomplish the same basic housekeeping and setup tasks in
Windows XP in many ways. Because I don’t know how your system is set up,
I lead you through the process from the start. The first thing you want to do
is set your system to Windows Classic mode. Here’s how:
1. Click Start and then choose Settings➪Control Panel.
The contents of the Control Panel folder appear on-screen.
2. Click the Display icon.
Or you can right-click an empty spot on the desktop and choose
Properties from the shortcut menu.

3. Select the Themes tab. Then, from the Theme drop-down menu,
choose Windows Classic (see Figure 1-5).
4. Click the Apply button.
5. Select the Desktop tab. From the Background list box, select None.
6. Click OK.
This procedure disables the active desktop in Windows, which frees some
valuable system resources.
Choosing Control Panel settings
Windows XP is remarkably stable, but for those rare times when it (or a pro-
gram running under Windows) crashes, it generates an error report and asks
whether you want to send the report to Microsoft. This feature, called Error
Reporting, takes system resources to run. Because I’m sure that you’d rather
have those resources working hard to keep Pro Tools running smoothly, I
recommend that you disable Error Reporting. Here’s the drill:
1. Click Start and choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Start menu
that appears.
2. Click the System icon.
3. Select the Advanced tab.
4. Click the Error Reporting button.
5. Select Disable Error Reporting.

6. Click OK.
7. Leave the Control Panel window open. You have more settings to
adjust.
Standby power should be set to Always On for your Pro Tools system. To do
this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it. (Click Start and choose
Settings➪Control Panel.)
2. Click the Power Options icon.
3. On the Power Schemes tab, choose the Always On option (as shown in
Figure 1-6).
4. Click OK.
5. Leave the Control Panel open. You have more settings to adjust.
You also want to make sure that your screen doesn’t go to sleep and crash
your session. These steps show you how to do this:
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it. (Click Start and choose
Settings➪Control Panel.)
2. Click the Display icon and then click the Screen Saver tab.
3. Choose None from the Screen Saver drop-down menu.
4. Click Apply.

5. Click the Appearance tab.
6. Click Effects.
Make sure that none of the options listed in the dialog box are selected
with a check mark (as you can see in Figure 1-7). If any are, simply click
those pesky check marks so they disappear.
7. Click OK.
8. Leave the Control Panel open; there’s still one more thing you have 
to do.
Your System Sounds need to be disabled to prevent potential problems with
Pro Tools. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it. (Click Start and choose
Settings➪Control Panel.)
2. Click the Sounds and Audio Devices icon.
3. Click the Sounds tab.
4. From the Sound Scheme drop-down menu, choose No Sounds (see
Figure 1-8).
5. Click OK.
6. Close the Control Panel.
Congratulations! You just configured your system settings.

Enabling DMA
All IDE hard drives on your system must have DMA enabled before Pro Tools
can effectively write and read data to and from your hard drives. To enable
DMA, do the following:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
2. From the contextual menu that appears, choose Properties to access
the System Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Hardware tab, and then click the Device Manager button.
4. In the Device Manager window, click IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers.
The Device Manager tree expands to show the controllers associated
with your system.
5. From the listing, double-click the Primary IDE controller and then
click the Advanced Settings tab.
If it doesn’t already read DMA If Available under the Transfer
Mode option, change it so it does (as shown in Figure 1-9). If you have
several disk drives on your system, you have to do the same for Device 0
and Device 1.
6. Click OK and repeat Step 5 for the Secondary IDE controller.
The Secondary IDE controller is in Device Manager, directly below the
Primary controller.

Disabling AutoPlay
AutoPlay is a feature of Windows XP that automatically runs certain pro-
grams or plays music on a CD when you insert it into your computer’s CD
drive. This is a handy feature in everyday life, but it can cause problems with
the Pro Tools software. For the sake of Pro Tools, disable AutoPlay for all CD
drives on your system. Here’s the drill:
1. Click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window duly appears.
2. In the My Computer window, right-click the icon for your CD drive.
3. From the contextual menu that appears, choose Properties to access
the Properties dialog box and then click the AutoPlay tab.
4. Choose Music Files from the Select Content Type menu.
5. At the bottom of the dialog box, select the Prompt Me Each Time to
Choose an Action radio button (see Figure 1-10).
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the Pictures, Video Files, Mixed Content,
Music CD, and Blank CD options for the Select Content Type drop-
down menu.
7. Click OK.
8. Repeat Steps 1–7 for each CD or DVD drive on your computer.

Disabling virus protection
Virus protection is an important thing to have on any computer that con-
nects to the Internet, but virus protection can also adversely affect Pro Tools
performance. Ideally, your Pro Tools host computer would be dedicated to
just running Pro Tools. However, many of you will be using an “all-purpose”
computer that you will use for many tasks, such as surfing the Web for busi-
ness, pleasure, and/or for helping with your children’s homework.
In that case, you should turn off your virus protection whenever you run Pro
Tools. Check with the documentation that came with your virus-protection
software for the best way to do this. (And don’t forget to re-enable virus pro-
tection before you log on to the Internet again.)
I hate to repeat myself, but I will: If you’re really serious about having a bul-
letproof system, try to keep any extra software (such as games, finance, pub-
lishing, graphics, and so on) off your audio computer. At the very least, keep
all other applications closed while you work in Pro Tools.
After you make all these system adjustments listed earlier, you need to
reboot your computer.
Connecting your hardware
After you have your system fine-tuned (as described in the previous sec-
tions), you can now connect your hardware. Shut down your computer 
and refer to Chapter 2 of this mini-book for the specifics on connecting 
your Digidesign hardware. Each piece of hardware has its own installation

procedure; I cover each one, step by step, in that chapter. After you have the
hardware connected, turn on your computer. Then, after the Windows desk-
top appears, turn on the power to your Digidesign hardware. (If you’re using
a product that doesn’t have a power switch, you can ignore this step.)
On Windows PCs, wait to install the program until after you attach your
hardware — and, if needed, power it on. The complete details for this proce-
dure are located in Chapter 2 of this mini-book.
Installing the program
After you complete the Windows system-setup adjustments listed in the pre-
vious sections, you can install Pro Tools software by following these steps:
1. Connect your Digidesign interface to your computer.
• For a 002 or 002 Rack: Connect the FireWire cable.
• For an Mbox: Use the USB connection.
• For an 001: Plug the PCI card into an open PCI slot and make the con-
nection between the PCI card and the breakout box (the rest of the
001 system).
2. Start Windows.
The Windows desktop appears.
3. Turn on your Digidesign interface if it has a power switch.
If you’re using a bus-powered device — such as the Mbox 2 interfaces —
it’ll already be powered on when you plug it in.
4. Insert the Pro Tools software CD in your computer’s CD drive.
5. Click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window appears.
6. In the My Computer window, click the icon for your CD drive.
The contents of the CD are displayed in a new window.
7. Open the Pro Tools Installer folder.
8. Click Setup.
9. After the Installer appears, click Next to continue.
10. Accept the Default paths for installation (they’re fine, and it’s less
hassle) and then click Next.
11. Wait for the installation to complete.
12. Restart your computer.

Keeping Bugs at Bay: Good Habits to Get Into
128
Digidesign has included additional drivers that aren’t needed for use with
Pro Tools, but are included in case you’re using third-party programs and
want your Digidesign hardware to interface with them. Frankly, I don’t rec-
ommend installing these drivers unless you absolutely have to. Remember,
it’s best to keep a lean, mean DAW machine, and that means staying away
from any unnecessary drivers and programs. If you have to install these driv-
ers for use with a third-party audio program (such as Sonar or Cubase), refer
to their manuals and the Digidesign documentation that came with your
hardware for instructions.
Keeping Bugs at Bay: Good Habits to Get Into
One thing is certain with computers: Hiccups will happen. Just when you
think everything is performing perfectly, something crashes your system.
Because these things are inevitable, I recommend that you work on develop-
ing some good habits to keep these minor problems from becoming disas-
ters. In this section, I list a bunch of things that can help give you as
stress-free an experience recording on your computer as possible.
Back up your data often
There’s an old saying about computer data — If it doesn’t exist in at LEAST
two places, then it DOESN’T EXIST! Your hard drive can be considered one
such “location.” A lot of people also copy their data to a second hard drive
(either the system drive or a FireWire drive) — and removable media back-
ups are also commonly used. This would include CD-R or DVD +/-R discs.
Regardless of the method you choose, the important thing is to back up your
data. Hard drives have become remarkably reliable, but as with anything
else, failures can and do happen. If your hard drive should fail (or if you acci-
dentally delete something that you shouldn’t have), you’ll be very happy
you made copies of all your Pro Tools sessions to another storage device —
and (if you didn’t make copies) very sad to see your hard work disappear
forever right before your eyes.
On a PC, I prefer to back the data up to a FireWire drive and to either CD-Rs
or DVD-Rs. DVD burners are becoming a more attractive option because DVDs
can hold over six times as much data as a CD-R, and the prices on DVD burn-
ers and discs are dropping all the time. I recently added a 20X DVD-/+RW
drive to my system, and it cost around $100. Blank DVDs run about 25 or 30
cents each when bought in quantities of 100. Because large Pro Tools ses-
sions can easily exceed the storage capacity of a CD-R, the extra storage
capacity of DVDs allows you to store the session on a single disc instead of
spanning it across multiple discs, which makes backing up your data that
much easier.

Chapter 1

Keeping Bugs at Bay: Good Habits to Get Into
129
The software you need for backing up your data to CD was probably
included with your CD/DVD burner (or came preinstalled on your system).
Any good burning software, such as Nero or CD Creator, will work just fine
for making CD-R backups of your work. For a Mac, Disk Utility works great
(located in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder). The impor-
tant thing to remember is that if it’s important to you, make a backup copy of
it. I recommend you get into the habit of backing up your session data at the
end of every Pro Tools session. Trust me — you’ll thank me for this later.
Back up your system drive
Because installing your OS, software applications, plug-ins, and so forth can
take a considerable amount of time, I prefer to back up this information as
well as my audio and session data. Some great programs are available that
allow you to create an image of your system drive onto another hard drive
or to removable media (such as DVD-Rs). In the event of a hard drive crash
or other problem, you can restore your drive (or a new drive) to exactly the
way you had it before the crash occurred. The best part is that this takes a
lot less time than reinstalling everything from scratch.
I normally install Windows XP, then all my software, and then back it up.
After that, I leave my system drive alone, and use my second drive exclu-
sively for Pro Tools sessions and audio data, leaving the system drive for
only the programs. Any time I add any new programs or plug-ins — or make
any other significant changes to my system drive — I create a new Ghost
backup before I install the new stuff. That way, if disaster does strike, my
system can bounce back and be up and running with very little delay.
Two great options are
✦Norton Ghost, www.norton-online/us/protect-data: This is for
PCs only.
✦EMC Retrospect, www.emcinsignia.com: Versions are available for
both Mac and PC.
A few minutes spent backing up your system drive and your Pro Tools ses-
sions now can save you hours of work reloading all of your programs later
and can also save you from losing that session you spent so many hours per-
fecting. Get into the habit of backing up your data regularly.

Your Hardware
In This Chapter
 Setting up the Mbox 2 series
 Advancing to the Digi 003 options
 Getting to know M-Audio interfaces
I
n order to use Pro Tools software, you need a Digidesign hardware 
interface — the box that gets the sound in and out of your computer.
Digidesign choices here include the Mbox 2, Mbox 2 Micro, Mbox 2 Mini,
Mbox 2 Pro, Digi 003, and Digi 003 Rack. If you’re using Pro Tools M-Powered
software, you have a ton of hardware options from the M-Audio family 
(23, as of this writing). All these interfaces work with either Macintosh- or
Windows-based computers. Digidesign interfaces use Pro Tools LE software,
and M-Audio uses Pro Tools M-Powered software, but they both have essen-
tially the same functions and almost identical operation. Differences in the
hardware include the number of inputs and outputs each interface provides,
the sample rates each one supports, and the different ways that they 
connect to your computer.
In this chapter, you get the lowdown on Mbox models, Digi 003, and Digi 003
Rack. I also offer an overview of the M-Audio options to give you some
insight into your choices. To help you choose the best interface for your
needs, I tell you how many inputs and outputs you get, note the sample
rates, and discuss connection requirements for each of these units. Also, in
the case of the Digi 003, I get you up to speed on the numerous functions of
the control surface — the faders and knobs that let you mix with your hands.
In this chapter, I also show you how to connect each interface so you can
get your system up and running.
Throughout this chapter, I describe a lot of connector types. Some of these
may be familiar to you, and others might seem a bit like rocket science.
(What is an S/PDIF, anyway, and will it blow up if you plug it in?) If you start
getting a little dizzy from all these new terms, check out Book I, Chapter 3,
where I explain all types of analog and digital connectors in detail.
Despite the differences between the various Digidesign interfaces, they
share many things, including

Pro Tools All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition

✦Preamps: All but one interface (the Mbox 2 Micro) contain at least one
preamp. Preamps boost the signal from microphones so that you can
record them directly into Pro Tools. I discuss preamps in detail in Book I,
Chapter 1.
✦Phantom power: Phantom power is a small current (48 volt; V) that’s
sent from your interface to your microphone (through the mic cable)
and is necessary for your condenser microphone to work. Phantom
power is available only on your preamp channels and can be toggled on
and off.
✦Line-level inputs: Line-level inputs are analog connections that you plug
your guitar, keyboard, or other instruments into your interface without
any gear between your instrument and the device. Getting your preamp
inputs in the interface to accept line-level signals is easy; just click a
button on the interface.
✦S/PDIF: Use a Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format (S/PDIF) connector
to plug an external converter into your interface, allowing you to bypass
the analog-to-digital (A/D) or digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion process.
Some people prefer this if they have separate converters whose sound
they prefer the sound over the ones contained in the interface. All
Digidesign interfaces contain S/PDIF inputs and outputs except for the
Mbox 2 Micro and Mini.
✦ADAT Lightpipe: The ADAT Lightpipe connectors, also known as ADAT
optical, allow up to eight channels of digital information coming and
going through your device. Like S/PDIF, this allows you to bypass the
conversion process in your interface. ADAT Lightpipe is useful if you
have an external digital mixer and you want to mix with that. The Digi
003 and Digi 003 Rack have ADAT Lightpipe inputs and outputs.
✦BNC wordclock: This is a special type of connector for sending and
receiving wordclock signals. (BNC stands for Bayonet Neil-Concelman,
for the dude who created it. It’s essentially a cable connector. A word-
clock is the digital clock used to calculate the sample rate for your
audio.) Use this connector to send and receive wordclock data to syn-
chronize your digital hardware, which is necessary only if you have a
bunch of digital devices connected. For example, if you have separate
A/D or D/A converters connected to your Digidesign interface, you might
want to connect them via the BNC wordclock to ensure that they all
operate from the same digital clock to help optimize the sound of 
each unit.
You can also send and receive wordclock data via the S/PDIF connection,
but this limits your optical jack input and output options to S/PDIF. In
the case of the 003, ADAT optical is disengaged, and you lose the eight
inputs and outputs that would be available through them.

Making Sense of the Mbox 2 Series
Mbox 2 (pronounced em-box too) products are the least-expensive Digidesign
interfaces. These Pro Tools hardware interfaces are perfect for people with
limited input and output needs (and maybe limited cash flow), such as solo
artists and singer/songwriters who need to record only a few tracks at a time
(instead of, say, the Flatbush Philharmonic), and those who need something
small and portable.
The four Mbox 2 options each have a user in mind: Mbox 2 Micro, Mbox 2
Mini, Mbox 2, and Mbox 2 Pro. The following sections detail these interfaces.
All the Mbox 2 interfaces, except for the Mbox 2 Pro, use a USB 1.1 connec-
tion. Even though this is the older, slower version of USB (compared with
USB 2.0), your USB 2.0 ports will function just fine with these interfaces.
Mbox 2 Micro
The Mbox 2 Micro (see Figure 2-1) is a small USB interface (using the slower
speed 1.1 protocol) that’s about the size of a jump or Flash drive. This inter-
face is designed to be used for editing, sequencing, or mixing. The Mbox 2
micro has no inputs and has only two outputs for monitoring through 
headphones or speakers.
The Mbox 2 Micro works up to 24-bit/48 kHz quality, which is fine for its 
purposes when all you need is for the device to act as a dongle (a hardware
authorization device) for the software and to monitor what you’re doing. It
comes with Pro Tools LE software, so for its price (about $250), it’s an inex-
pensive way to have Pro Tools on a second computer (such as a laptop) for
working on previously recorded audio tracks with loops or MIDI sequences.

I’ve found the Mbox 2 Micro to be a great tool for working on ideas when I
travel. I even developed a pretty decent rough mix of a song on one of my
upcoming CDs while I was on a plane. In the past, I haven’t been able to work
in Pro Tools anywhere except my studio because all the other Digidesign
hardware options were too big. (Even the other Mbox 2 models are too big
for me to take on a plane and work when I fly.) This limitation has kept me
from using Pro Tools for any production because I travel a lot and need to be
able to work without hauling a ton of gear. This little unit took care of the
problem for me.
The Mbox 2 Micro is an output-only device. If you want to record any audio
tracks, you need to buy one of the other Digidesign or M-Audio interfaces
that have analog or digital inputs.
Connecting an Mbox 2 Micro to a Windows computer
Hooking up the Mbox 2 Micro involves these steps:
1. With your computer turned on, plug the Mbox 2 Micro into a USB port
in your computer.
Don’t use a USB hub: Connect directly into your computer. This keeps
your signal from being interrupted by having too much data trying to get
through one USB line.
If the New Hardware Wizard opens, leave it alone. Don’t click Next — just
leave it open and untouched. If the wizard starts to install anything 
automatically, click Cancel.
2. Install the software and restart your computer according to the proce-
dure I detail in Chapter 1 of this mini-book.
At this point, the green light should be lit, showing power to the Mbox 2
Micro. If it’s not or if it’s blinking, unplug it from your computer, wait for
ten seconds, and then plug it back in.
Be sure to complete all the system setup procedures listed in Chapter 1 of
this mini-book. This ensures that your system runs smoothly.
Connecting an Mbox 2 Micro to a Macintosh computer
To hook up the Mbox 2 Micro to a Mac, simply follow these steps:

Getting sound out of an Mbox 2 Micro
The Mbox 2 Micro has a 1⁄8" jack from which you can connect headphones for
speakers.
✦Headphones: Make sure you have headphones with a 1⁄8" jack (like for an
iPod). Otherwise, you need to get a 1⁄4"– 1⁄8" adapter. Many decent studio
headphones, such as the AKG 240, have cords with 1⁄8" and 1⁄4" plugs.
✦Speakers: With a 1⁄8" jack, you need a cable with a 1⁄8" male plug on one
end that’s compatible with your speakers. Most computer speakers can
handle a direct connection because a 1⁄8" jack is standard for computers
and computer speakers. If you’re using studio monitors, such as a
Mackie HR-624, you need to find a cord that has connectors, such as 1⁄4"
plugs, on the other end.
You can adjust the level of your headphone or speakers by using the volume
dial located on the Mbox 2 Micro.
Mbox 2 Mini
This small interface — not as tiny as the Mbox2 Micro — has two analog
inputs and outputs. The Mbox 2 Mini connects via USB 1.1 and contains
internal power, so you don’t have to plug the unit into an outlet. This makes
it useful for portable recording. This USB 1.1 connection, which limits your
recording to 24 bits and up to 48 kHz, can introduce some latency (time delay
while the digital information enters and exits your computer). This limitation
is mitigated by the zero-latency monitoring option. (More on this in the
upcoming “Mbox 2” section this chapter.) You can see the Mbox 2 Mini in
Figure 2-2.
The Mbox 2 Mini has the following input/output configurations:
✦Inputs: You can have two simultaneous inputs, including one with a
preamp and phantom power for microphones.
✦Outputs: You have two outputs for your speakers.
✦Headphone jack: There is a separate headphone jack.

Getting sound in and out of an Mbox 2 Mini
The Mbox 2 Mini has the following connectors and dials:
✦Input 1: This input allows you to connect a microphone or an instru-
ment (such as a keyboard, guitar, or bass). This input is controlled by
the Input 1 dial on the front of the Mbox 2 Mini. On the back are 
these jacks:
• Microphone: Use the XLR plug to plug in your microphone. When you
do so, also disengage the Mic/DI button to set the device for a micro-
phone signal. If you’re using a condenser microphone, you engage
the button — marked 48V — on the back of the device. This turns on
phantom power. (Go to Book I, Chapter 5 for more on condenser
mics and phantom power.) You might also want to engage the Pad if
your signal becomes too loud.
• Instrument: The 1⁄4" jack lets you plug in an instrument, such as a key-
board or drum machine. When you use this jack, depress the Mic/DI
button — and, depending on the level of your instrument, the Pad
button to reduce the level entering the device.
• Guitar or bass: The 1⁄4" jack also functions as a direct box, so you can
plug your guitar or bass directly into the interface without needing a
separate device. (Check out Book I, Chapter 1 for more about direct
boxes.) Because guitars produce a lower-level signal than other
instruments, you need to disengage the Pad button.
✦Input 2: This input consists of a 1⁄4" jack that accepts either an instru-
ment or a guitar connection. You control this input from the Input 2 dial
located on the front of the Mbox 2 Mini. You plug your instrument or
guitar in the back by using these settings:

Making Sense of the Mbox 2 Series
138
• Instrument: When you use this jack for your keyboard or synthesizer,
you might need to depress the Pad button to reduce the level entering
the device.
• Guitar or bass: Guitars produce a lower-level signal than other instru-
ments, so you’ll need to disengage the Pad button when you plug in
this jack.
✦Mon Out: Monitor Outputs (Mon Out) is where you connect cords to go
to your speakers (monitors). For more on monitors, check out Book I,
Chapter 1. This output is controlled by the headphone/speaker dial on
the front of the Mbox 2 Mini.
✦Headphones: The 1⁄4" jack on the front of the Mbox Mini is where you
plug in your headphones. This jack is controlled by the headphone/
speaker dial to the right of the jack.
✦Mix: The front panel also has a Mix knob, which you use to monitor your
inputs while you record and also listen to the playback of any recorded
tracks. Adjusting this knob allows you to mix — in your headphones —
the balance between your input and recorded stuff. I offer a little more
detail on this process in the “Mbox 2” section that follows.
After you have all your gear connected, all you need to do is open Pro Tools
software and start working. Chapter 3 in this mini-book (the next chapter)
gets you up to speed on the basics of the software.
Mbox 2
Mbox 2 is the second-generation Mbox interface. This is a bus-powered USB
1.1 interface, so you don’t need to plug it in to an outlet. You can record in 24
bits up to 48 kHz sample rate. You can also connect a MIDI instrument. The
Mbox 2 (as shown in Figure 2-3) has the following input/output configurations:
✦Analog inputs: You can have two simultaneous inputs.
✦Preamps: Both analog inputs have preamps for connecting your mics
directly into the interface. You also have phantom power for both 
channels.
✦Analog outputs: You have two outputs for your speakers or monitors.
✦Headphone jack: There is a separate headphone jack.
✦MIDI In and Out: You can connect a MIDI device via the MIDI Input and
Output jacks.
✦Digital inputs and outputs: Use the S/PDIF coax (RCA) In and Out to
send and receive digital signal from the Mbox 2. This is handy if you
have external A/D and D/A converters that you prefer.

Getting sound in and out of an Mbox 2
The Mbox 2 has the following connectors and dials:
✦Inputs 1 and 2: These inputs allow you to connect a microphone, an
instrument (such as keyboard), or a guitar or bass. The inputs are con-
trolled by the Input dials on the front of the Mbox 2. The Input jack that
is enabled is selected by using the Source button (it’s unmarked) located
above the DI and Mic lights in each Input section and next to the Pad
button. In back are three jacks that you can use for each channel:
• Microphone: Use the XLR jack to plug in your microphone. When you
do so, press the Source button until the Mic light illuminates. If you’re
using a condenser microphone, you engage the button (marked 48V)
just to the right of the Input 1 section. Phantom power is on when the
light is illuminated. (Go to Book I, Chapter 5 for more on condenser
mics and phantom power.) You might also want to engage the Pad
button if your signal becomes too loud.
• DI: The 1⁄4" jack, labeled DI, functions as a direct box, so you can plug
your guitar or bass directly into the interface without needing a sepa-
rate device. (Check out Book I, Chapter 1 for more about direct boxes.)
• Line: Use the 1⁄4" jack marked line (TRS) to plug in an instrument, such
as a keyboard or drum machine. When you use this jack, you need to
depress the Source button until both the DI and Mic lights are off for
the input channel. Depending on the level of your instrument, you
might want to engage the Pad button to reduce the level entering the
device.
✦Mon Out: Monitor Outputs is where you connect cords to go to your
speakers (monitors). (For more on monitors, check out Book I, Chapter 1.)
This output is controlled by the Monitor dial on the front.
✦S/PDIF: Here, you can connect your digital devices by using a coaxial
cable (RCA). The S/PDIF connection is handy for connecting external
converters or other digital components, such as Digital Audio Tape

(DAT) machines. There are no controls you have to worry about on the
front. A light on the upper left of the front panel alerts you if you have
anything connected to these jacks.
✦MIDI: You can connect your MIDI keyboard, MIDI controller, or other
device to these. The MIDI In is connected to the MIDI Out of your device,
and the MIDI Out goes to the MIDI In of the other device. There are no
controls to worry about on the front panel of the Mbox 2.
✦Headphones: The 1⁄4" jack on the front of the Mbox 2 is where you plug in
your headphones. This jack is controlled by the headphone dial to the
right of the jack.
✦Mono: The Mono button on the front of the Mbox 2 allows you to hear
your song in mono. This is a good idea when you’re mixing to make sure
that you don’t have any funny sounds (a highly technical term) happening
in your stereo mixes. Check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for more about checking
your mixes in mono.
✦Mix: Use the Mix knob to monitor your inputs while you record and also
to hear the playback of any tracks. Adjusting this knob allows you to mix
the balance between your input and recorded stuff in your headphones.
This makes it easy to overdub without hearing a delay from the time it
takes your instrument’s signal to enter and exit the computer. Because the
Mbox 2 uses a USB connection and because USB transfer rates are pretty
slow (for audio, anyway), the delay is significant. Using the Mix function in
the Mbox 2 allows you to have zero-latency monitoring. In other words,
you won’t experience delay in your headphones when you overdub
tracks.
Of course, using zero-latency monitoring causes other problems. That is,
your overdubbed tracks are exactly 147 samples behind (the amount of
time it takes the signal to enter the computer) your recorded tracks. If
you use the Mix knob when you overdub and you played in time with the
tracks recorded in Pro Tools, you need to move them earlier in the session
(song) to align them. This isn’t a big deal, and I give you step-by-step
instructions on how to do this in Book III, Chapter 4.
With all your gear hooked up, you’re ready to start recording. I cover the
specifics of this in Book III, but if you haven’t used Pro Tools before, I recom-
mend going to the next chapter (Chapter 3 in this mini-book), well, next.
Mbox 2 Pro
The Mbox 2 Pro is a step up from the other Mbox 2 models. Pro features
many more input and output options, but the most significant improvement
is its FireWire interface. This means that you input/output latency is signifi-
cantly reduced — so much that you don’t have to use zero-latency monitor-
ing trickery to eliminate the delay in your headphones while you record your
tracks. Figure 2-4 shows the Mbox 2 Pro.

Making Sense of the Mbox 2 Series
142
This feature alone makes this interface a lot better than the other Mbox
offerings in my opinion. And because it uses FireWire, your transfer speed is
fast enough for you to record in higher sample rates. In this case, you can
record up to 96 kHz. This is in line with the more expensive 003 interfaces.
The only thing missing in the Mbox 2 Pro is enough inputs and outputs to
record the better part of a band (like with the Digi 003 options). In this case,
you have the following input and outputs numbers:
✦Simultaneous analog inputs: You’ll find two inputs with preamps and
phantom power for your microphones as well as two inputs that accept
an instrument or a turntable.
✦Analog outputs: Pro offers two main monitor Outs for your speakers and
four Line Outs for additional speakers or to send your outputs to other gear.
✦RCA phono inputs: These allow you to connect a tape player, a CD
player, or even a turntable to your interface.
✦Two-channel, digital S/PDIF In and Out: These allow you to send and
receive digital signal from an Mbox 2 Pro. This is handy if you have
external A/D and D/A converters that you prefer or if you have a CD
player with digital outputs.
✦Headphone jacks: There are two separate headphone jacks, each with
their own volume control.
✦MIDI In and Out: You can connect a MIDI device via the MIDI Input and
Output jacks.
✦BNC wordclock In and Out: These allow you to send and receive word-
clock data so you can synchronize your digital hardware. This is one of
the other Pro features of this interface.
✦Footswitch input: You can connect a footswitch to start and stop your
Pro Tools sessions with your foot, which can be handy if you record
yourself because it lets you start and stop the session hands-free.

Getting sound in and out of an Mbox 2 Pro
The Mbox 2 Pro is pretty flexible when getting connected. Here’s a rundown
of the ins and outs of it all:
✦Inputs 1 and 2: Use these inputs to connect a microphone, an instrument
(such as keyboard), or a guitar or bass. The inputs are controlled by the
Input dials on the front of the unit. The Input jack that is enabled is
selected using the Source button (it’s unmarked) located above the DI
and Mic lights in each Input section. In back are three jacks that you can
use for each channel:
• Microphone: Use the combo jack on the back to plug in your micro-
phone. When you do so, press the Source button until the Mic light
illuminates. If you’re using a condenser microphone, you engage the
button (marked 48V), just to the right of the Input 1 section. Phantom
power is on when the light is illuminated. This turns on phantom power.
(Go to Book I, Chapter 5 for more on condenser mics and phantom
power.) You may also want to engage the Pad button if your signal
becomes too loud.
• Line: The combo jack on the back of the Mbox 2 Pro also allows you
to plug in an instrument, such as a keyboard or drum machine. When
you use this jack, you need to depress the Source button until both
the DI and Mic lights are off for the input channel. Depending on the
level of your instrument, you might want to engage the Pad button to
reduce the level entering the device.
• DI: The 1⁄4" jack located on the front of the unit functions as a direct
box so you can plug your guitar or bass directly into the interface
without needing a separate device. (Check out Book I, Chapter 1 for
more about direct boxes.) Press the Source button until the DI light
is illuminated.
✦Aux In: The Aux (auxiliary) input is for an instrument or a turntable. You
have two options:
• RCA jacks: You use the RCA jacks if you want to plug in your turntable.
This jack provides a preamp and is engaged when you press the
Source button on the front next to the Aux dial until the Phono light
is lit up.

•
1⁄4" TS jacks: These jacks are for instruments. The two jacks are for
your left and right signals. You could theoretically plug two different
instruments in these, but you have only one Gain knob on the front
to adjust the input volume. Whatever instruments you plug in to
these, you need to press the Source button for the Aux channel until
no light is lit to engage these inputs.
✦Mon Out: Monitor Outputs are where you connect cords to go to your
speakers (monitors). (For more on monitors, check out Book I, Chapter 1.)
This output is controlled by the Monitor dial on the front.
✦Line Outs: Four line outputs use 1⁄4" TS jacks. These are for connecting to
other gear or speakers. These outputs don’t have a volume control. The
signal level going to these outputs is controlled by the Master fader of
your session. If you want to be able to adjust the volume to a set of
speakers, you need a mixer or external volume controller.
✦S/PDIF: Here, you can connect your digital devices by using a coaxial
cable (RCA). The S/PDIF connection is handy for connecting external
converters or other digital components, such as DAT machines. There
are no controls you have to worry about on the front. A light on the
upper left of the front panel alerts you if you have anything connected to
these jacks.
✦Line Out 5/6: These 1⁄4" jacks allow you to send two additional outputs to
an external location. This can be handy if you want to create an alter-
nate monitor mix (for a submix, for example). Like with the Line Outs
described earlier, there is no volume dial for these outputs.
✦Footswitch: Labeled Foot SW, use this jack to connect a footswitch to
the interface so you can start and stop your session without using your
hands. You can find footswitches for this purpose at almost any music
store. They generally cost around $20.
✦Wordclock: Use these jacks, which look like typical coax-cable jacks, to
connect an Mbox 2 Pro to other digital gear that has wordclock capabilities.
This is only necessary when you have more than one digital piece of
equipment (such as external digital converters) and you want to
synchronize their clocks.
✦MIDI: You can connect your MIDI keyboard, MIDI controller, or other
device to these. MIDI In is connected to the MIDI Out of your device, and
MIDI Out goes to the MIDI In of the other device. There are no controls
to worry about on the front panel of the Mbox 2 Pro.
✦Headphones: The 1⁄4" jack on the front of unit is where you can plug in
your headphones. This jack is controlled by the headphone dial to the
right of the jack.

After you have all your gear connected, you can get started recording. I
recommend that if you haven’t used Pro Tools before, finish Book II first.
This will give you a solid foundation so you can work efficiently.
Digging Into the Digi 003 Interfaces
Digi 003 interfaces are FireWire interfaces that replaced the 002 and can
record at high sample rates, up to 96 kHz (in 24 bits, of course). The 003
models consist of the 003 (see Figure 2-5) and the 003 Rack (see Figure 2-6).
Both have the same input and output configurations. The difference is that
the 003 has a control surface built in, which gives you hands-on faders,
knobs, dials, and buttons. For people who need the tactile experience while
they work, the 003 is a great option.

Digidesign also makes a Command|8 control surface that you can add if you
get the 003 Rack or any other interface and decide you need physical faders
and buttons and so on. Of course, this will cost you more than if you bought
the 003 initially.
Recording at high sample rates, such as 88.2 kHz or 96 kHz, takes twice 
the room on your hard drive and requires twice the processing power than
recording at 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. Some people swear by the improvement in
sound, but most experienced ears will say that the overall improvement in
sonic quality is barely noticeable. If you have the power and the disc space, I
recommend recording at the higher sample rates for advantages other than
simply sonic quality, such as half the latency. If your computer or hard drive
isn’t the biggest and fastest — or if you want to record a ton of tracks and
process the heck out of them — you might want to stick with the standard
rate for CD audio: 44.1 kHz.
Discovering the Digi 003 input and outputs
Both the Digi 003 and the 003 Rack have the same input and output
configurations:
✦Simultaneous analog inputs: These eight inputs include four with pre-
amps and phantom power for your microphones and four that accept an
instrument.
✦Analog outputs: These eight outputs allow you to have send alternate
mixes or submixes of tracks in your session.
✦Monitor outputs: Labeled Main and Alt, these two sets of monitor out-
puts allow you to connect two sets of speakers.
✦Alt In: These alternate input jacks are handy for connecting a CD player
or tape deck and listening to it without having to turn on the software or
listening to reference CDs from an external player while you mix.
✦Digital In and Out channels: These channels comprise eight channels of
ADAT optical and two channels of S/PDIF coax (RCA), which you use to
send and receive digital signals to and from the 003. This is handy if you
have external A/D and D/A converters or a digital mixer.
✦Headphone jacks: The two headphone jacks each have their own
volume control.
✦MIDI In and Out: The 003 has one MIDI In port and two MIDI Out ports.
✦BNC wordclock In and Out: Use these to send and receive wordclock
data to synchronize your digital hardware.
✦Footswitch input: You can connect a footswitch to control the transport
of Pro Tools, which can be handy when recording yourself — you can
start and stop the session hands-free.

Connecting an 003 to a Windows computer
Follow these steps to hook up an 003:
1. With your computer turned on, plug a cord into the FireWire port in
the 003 and the other end of the cord into a FireWire port in your
computer.
Don’t use a FireWire hub: Connect directly into your computer. This
keeps your signal from being interrupted by having too much data trying
to get through one FireWire cord.
If the New Hardware Wizard opens, leave it alone. Don’t click Next — just
leave it open and untouched. If the wizard starts to install anything
automatically, click Cancel.
2. Install the software and restart your computer according to the proce-
dures that I describe in Chapter 1 of this mini-book.
Be sure to complete all the system setup procedures listed in Chapter 1 of
this mini-book. This ensures that your system runs smoothly.
You can open your software when you’re ready to record. Chapter 3 of this
mini-book has the details.
Connecting an 003 to a Macintosh computer
To hook up an 003 to a Mac, simply follow these steps:
1. Install the Pro Tools LE software that comes with the 003 and restart
your computer.
See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for the details of this process.
2. With your computer turned on, plug a cord into the FireWire port in
the 003 and the other end of the cord into a FireWire port in your
computer.
Don’t use a FireWire hub: Connect directly into your computer. The 003
doesn’t function well when other devices are using the same FireWire
port in the computer.
You’re ready to open your software and get started. Check out Chapter 3 of
this mini-book to get familiar with the Pro Tools LE.
Be sure to complete all the system setup procedures listed in Chapter 1 of
this mini-book to ensure that your system runs smoothly.

Connecting your gear to an 003
Connecting audio and MIDI gear is much the same process for the 003 as for
the Mbox 2 Pro, with just more inputs and outputs. Here’s a rundown of
them all:
✦Inputs 1–4: Use these inputs to connect microphones, instruments
(such as a keyboard or synthesizer), or guitars or basses. The inputs are
controlled by the Input dials on the front of the unit. The input jack that
is enabled is selected using the Source button (it’s unmarked) located
above the DI and Mic lights in each Input section. In back are jacks that
you can use for each channel:
• Microphone: Use the XLR jack, in back, to plug in your microphone.
When you do so, press the Input source button until the Mic/DI light
illuminates. If you’re using a condenser microphone, you engage the
button (marked 48V) on the back near the input. This turns on phantom
power. (Go to Book I, Chapter 5 for more on condenser mics and
phantom power.) You might also want to engage the low pass filter
located on the front.
• DI: The 1⁄4" jack on the back of the unit functions as a direct box when
you have the Mic/DI light illuminated. This gives you the proper
signal level so you can plug your guitar or bass directly into the
interface without needing a separate device. (Check out Book I,
Chapter 1 for more about direct boxes.)
• Line: The 1⁄4" jack on the back of a 003 also lets you plug in an instru-
ment, such as a keyboard or drum machine. When you use this jack,
you need to depress the source button until the Mic/DI light is off for
the input channel.
✦Inputs 5–8: These 1⁄4" TRS inputs are optimized for instrument (line) level
sources, such as keyboards, synthesizers, or drum machines. There is
no input gain control for these inputs. You need to set the gain on your
instrument. You also have buttons for –10 decibel (dB) or +4 dB signals.
Book I, Chapter 2 has more in these types of signals.
✦Footswitch: Labeled Foot SW, use this jack to connect a footswitch to
the interface so you can start and stop your session hands-free. You can
find footswitches for this purpose at almost any music store. They gen-
erally cost around $20.
✦FireWire: This is where you connect your FireWire cable to go to your
computer. The second jack can be used to chain this unit to an external
FireWire hard drive (although I prefer connecting extra hard drives
directly to the computer).
✦Line Outs: Eight line outputs use 1⁄4" TRS jacks. These are for connecting
to other gear or speakers. These outputs don’t have a volume control.
The signal level going to these outputs is controlled by the channel

Digging Into the Digi 003 Interfaces
150
faders of your session. If you want to be able to adjust the volume to a
set of speakers, you need a mixer or an external volume controller.
✦Mon Out: Monitor Outputs are where you connect cords to go to
you speakers (monitors). (For more on monitors, check out Book I,
Chapter 1.) This output is controlled by the Monitor dial on the front.
✦Alt Output: These jacks duplicate the signal coming out of the Main
Outputs 1 and 2. These jacks are handy if you have two sets of monitors,
and you want to hook them both up to your system.
✦Alt Input: These jacks can be routed to inputs 7 and 8 of the 003 (instead
of whatever is plugged into the normal line 7 and 8 inputs) or sent directly
to the Monitor Outputs. This is useful if you want to listen to a tape deck
or CD player without firing up Pro Tools software or your computer.
✦Optical In and Out: Here, you can connect your digital devices by using
an optical connection. This jack can either pass eight channels of ADAT
or two channels of S/PDIF. You make this adjustment within the software.
The eight channels of ADAT are unavailable when you record in high res-
olution (88.2 kHz or 96 kHz). Lights on the front panels let you know
whether you are connected via S/PDIF or ADAT.
✦S/PDIF: Here, you can connect your digital devices with a coaxial cable
(RCA). This S/PDIF connection is enabled whenever you have cords 
connected to these jacks and when you don’t have the Optical jacks
assigned for S/PDIF signals. There are no controls you have to worry
about in the front. A light on the front panel alerts you if you have 
anything connected to these jacks.
✦Wordclock: These jacks, which look like typical coax-cable jacks, are
used to connect the 003 to other digital gear that has wordclock capabil-
ities. This is necessary only when you have more than one digital piece
of equipment (such as external digital converters), and you want to 
synchronize their clocks.
✦MIDI: You can connect your MIDI keyboard, MIDI controller, or other
device to these. MIDI In is connected to the MIDI Out of your device, and
MIDI Out goes to the MIDI In of the other device. There are no controls
to worry about on the front panel of the 003.
✦Headphones: The 1⁄4" jacks on the front of unit are where you plug in
your headphones. You can plug in two sets of headphones, and each has
its own volume control.
After you have all your gear connected, you can get started recording. I 
recommend that you finish Book II first if you haven’t used Pro Tools before.
This will give you a solid foundation so you can work efficiently.

Examining the 003 control surface features
The control surface is the only difference between the Digi 003 and the Digi
003 Rack, but it’s a big difference. Like with the Rack version, you have con-
trols for four mic preamps as well as the headphone and monitoring con-
trols. Although the control surface doesn’t completely eliminate the need for
a keyboard and mouse, many functions that would require them when using
a Digi 003 Rack can be controlled directly from the control surface of the Digi
003, which has six main sections (which I describe in the following sections).
I don’t cover all the details of the 003 control surface, but the following 
sections give you a good overview to get you started.
Fader section
The Fader section takes up the largest section of the Digi 003 top panel. It
includes
✦Motorized, touch-sensitive, 100mm faders: These eight faders control
volume levels of individual tracks, among a host of other functions.
These faders also move to follow the changes of the faders on-screen.
This feature is helpful when performing complex mixes with automation.
(Book VI, Chapter 6 has more on automating mixes.)
✦Mute, Solo, and SEL (Select) buttons: These buttons control the Mute,
Solo, and Selection functions in the software.
✦Rotary Encoders: Use encoders for panning sound from one channel to
another, as well as for other functions, such as adjusting reverb settings
or other plug-in parameters.
✦Encoder Meter LED Rings: These rings are used for showing the posi-
tion of your encoder knobs, track levels, and so forth.
✦Channel Meter LEDs: These five-segment LEDs show your level as well
as the automation mode for the track, depending on how the meter
switch is set.
Console/Channel View section
The Console/Channel View section is the collection of buttons directly above
the fader section. These buttons, when used along with the Scribble Strips,
SEL buttons, Rotary Encoders, and Encoder Meters (and even the eight main
faders), offer a variety of capabilities from viewing and adjusting the Aux Send
levels to changing the parameters for panning, channel inserts, and plug-ins.

Digging Into the Digi 003 Interfaces
152
View is the Digidesign term for what’s displayed on the Digi 003 control 
surface. The 003 offers two views: Console and Channel.
✦Console view: What you see on-screen is a virtual console; you can
adjust panning, sends, and inserts for all channels on the control 
surface.
✦Channel view: All the Rotary Encoder controls and Scribble Strips 
are used to display and manipulate controls of various types — plug-in
parameters, inserts, or sends — for a single track. If, for example, you
want to see all the values for a particular plug-in (or all the send levels
for a particular track) at once, Channel view is the way to get a look at it.
Use the switches directly above the Scribble Strips to select which type of
data is displayed. You can navigate through various plug-in pages, bypass a
plug-in, or exit Channel view and return to Console view.
Global Fader controls
Located just above and to the right and left of the channel faders, the Global
Fader controls affect how all the faders operate as well as their assignments.
The following list spells out what each Global Fader control does:
✦Record Arm: The Record Arm (Enable) switch does just what its name
suggests: It enables the recording capability for tracks when you press
it. Pressing the Channel Select switch immediately after that is how you
specify the track(s) you want to, uh, record-enable.
✦Fader Flip: The Fader Flip switch functions in a variety of different ways,
depending on which view mode you’re in. Normally, when you press this
button, it flips the main Channel Faders and the Rotary Encoders. Then
you can use the Channel Faders to control panning and other functions
normally handled by the Rotary Encoder controls. Hey, sometimes that’s
just more intuitive.
• Send Flip mode, which operates when you’re in Console view, allows
you to adjust send levels with the Channel Faders instead of the
Rotary Encoders.
• Plug-in Flip mode, which functions when you’re in Channel view and
have a plug-in open, allows you to use the Channel Faders to control
the parameters of software plug-ins, such as compressors and 
equalizers.
✦Master Fader: The Master Fader switch gives you the ability to move all
Master faders in your Pro Tools session to the far right of the control
surface.
✦Default Switch: This is used with the Channel Select switch to return
your fader to its default position.

Book II
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your
Hardware
Digging Into the Digi 003 Interfaces
153
✦Input Switch: The Input switch toggles between Auto Input and Input
Only Monitor modes for your record-enabled tracks.
Transport, jog/shuttle wheel, and Navigation controls
Located just to the right of the faders is the Transport and Navigation section,
offering dedicated controls for transport functions — record, play, stop, and
so on. These duplicate the on-screen transport controls found in the Pro
Tools software.
The jog/shuttle wheel is located above the transport controls and allows you
to quickly scroll through your session and “scrub” back and forth through
audio (like rocking tape across the playback head) to find glitches in your
tracks. The outer part of the dial scrolls through your session, and the inner
part of the dial has a finer resolution for scrubbing. As well, you can scroll
through track assignments for the fader by holding the Nudge key while you
roll the outer dial.
A large, circular collection of four switches holds the Navigation and Zoom
keys. Used along with the three keys immediately above them (Bank, Nudge,
and Zoom), these zoom in and out of waveform displays, select banks of
faders in groups of eight, or nudge the faders to the left or right, one track at
a time. This allows you to control all the on-screen faders with just the eight
hardware faders on the 003. Magic? Maybe not, but it’s close enough for
rock’n’roll.
There are also buttons for selecting Loop Playback and Loop Record; to
enable or disable Quick Punch; and to switch between the Edit, Mix, and
Plug-in windows in the Pro Tools software.
The Function/Utility switches on the far right of the 003 are primarily used
for when you use the Digi 003 as a standalone mixer without a computer. You
use these switches to handle such tasks as entering Utility mode, naming
channels, and taking fader and control “snapshots” (as well as saving and
recalling them) so you have a clear record of exactly what you did in a par-
ticular session.
The F4 and F5 keys are surprisingly useful for running the Pro Tools software:
✦F4: Pressing F4 temporarily disables that spooky movement of the
motorized hardware faders, without affecting the actual automation
within the Pro Tools software. This feature can be handy when you’re
recording yourself with a microphone in the same room as the 003 and
you don’t want your microphone to pick up the sound of the faders
moving around. When you’re done, just press F4 a second time, and
fader operation returns to normal.

Digging Into the Digi 003 Interfaces
154
✦F5: Pressing the F5 switch can call up plug-ins that you inserted on 
various tracks and allows you to quickly change to various data-display
modes for the Scribble Strips.
Status Indicators and Display Controls areas
Directly above the Transport and Navigation controls is the Status Indicators
and Display Controls area of the Digi 003.
Here you’ll find a multi-LED display that indicates the following:
✦Main LED showing track, send and insert names, pan position, send
levels, and plug-in information
The content of the LED is determined by the Channel and Console view
selection.
✦Sample rate for the current session
✦Successful communication with your computer via the FireWire 
interface
✦Whether MIDI data is being received at the MIDI In port or being
transmitted out of either MIDI Out port
Two additional Scribble Strips are also located here (called the Display
Scribble Strips). These displays have two modes, which you can toggle by
pressing the Display Mode switch:
✦Status mode: This displays the current status of the Channel Scribble
Strips, letting you know exactly what sort of data they are displaying,
such as pan, sends, EQ, and so on.
✦Counter mode: This displays the value of the main location indicator in
the Pro Tools software, letting you know exactly what position you’re at
within your song. This can be displayed as bars and beats, minutes and
seconds, or in samples, depending on which of the three is selected as
the main time scale in the Pro Tools software.
The Encoder/Meter Mode switch allows you to change the type of data
displayed by the Encoder Meter LED rings that surround each Rotary
Encoder control. When you toggle this switch, the meters display either
levels or panning positions. This capability is available for mono or stereo
channels and sends (the signal going to effects); the three Encoder/Meter
Mode LED indicators show you the current status.
Switches for Enter, Undo, and entering Standalone Mode are also located in
this section.

Automation section
Use the Automation section to control automation modes and functions.
With the Read, Write, Latch, Touch, and Off switches, you can enable or
disable these automation modes for any track. As well, this section has a
switch that suspends automation across all tracks.
Keyboard Modifier switches
When you start using Pro Tools, you’re likely to suspect right away that many
tasks are performed by pressing a combination of two or more keys on your
keyboard. These keyboard shortcuts can save you a lot of time compared
with fishing around in the program menu for the action you want to perform.
The Keyboard Modifier switches duplicate often-used computer keys used
for these commands (such as Shift, Option, and Control).
M-Audio Interfaces
A few years ago, the Digidesign parent company bought the audio hardware
maker M-Audio. Rather than absorb their product line, they chose to add Pro
tools functionality to many of the M-Audio interfaces. This is done through a
version of Pro Tools called (logically enough) Pro Tools M-Powered. At first,
just a few M-Audio interfaces could run Pro Tools M-Powered, but as time
went by, more and more interfaces were added. At the time of this writing,
more than 20 different M-Audio interfaces work with Pro Tools M-Powered
software. Rather than go into all the details of all these hardware options, this
section offers an overview of the different hardware and their basic features,
such as input and output configurations. Tables 2-1 and 2-2 break down many
of the currently compatible M-Audio interfaces and show you the capabilities
of the interfaces.
Digidesign continues to add M-Audio–compatible hardware to this list, so I
recommend going here for an up-to-date list of compatible hardware:
www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=151&navid=35&itemid=4901
M-Audio interfaces don’t come with Pro Tools M-Powered software. You need
to buy the software separately (around $250), so even though the M-Audio
interfaces are generally less expensive than the Digidesign ones, it ends up
costing you as much or more to use an M-Audio interface. My experience is
also that the Digidesign interfaces sound better than the M-Audio ones. (Of
course, this is subjective, and I’m sure many people feel the other way.)

Book II: Getting Started Using Pro Tools

Chapter 3: Examining 
Software Basics
In This Chapter
 Getting to know Pro Tools conventions
 Configuring system settings
 Understanding sessions
 Managing files
P
ro Tools software is one of the more simple and easy-to-use audio
programs available. However, just like any software, you need to know
some basic conventions to work efficiently. This chapter covers the basics
so you can better understand your software as well as get your system
configured properly. This chapter also shows you how to open, set up, and
navigate sessions (which I talk about in the second half of the chapter) as
well as how to manage file formats and file types.
Keeping Software Straight
Pro Tools comes in several versions: for example, TDM and LE, Mac and PC.
Although the versions sport only minor differences, knowing the differences
can help you better understand your own system. Read on to find out the
details.
Looking at Pro Tools versions
Digidesign, the maker of Pro Tools software, offers three basic types of
systems: LE, M-Powered, and HD. Although this book focuses on Pro Tools
LE and M-Powered, you might encounter the HD version if you take your
files to a commercial studio. In this section, I offer an overview of these
types of systems.
Pro Tools LE and M-Powered
Pro Tools LE and M-powered version are host-based systems. The Digidesign
(the 003, for example) or M-Audio hardware (the FireWire 410, for example)
acts as an interface between the analog-and-digital world and the software.
Pro Tools software relies on the processing power of your computer’s CPU

Getting Set Up

to work: That is, all the recording, playback, mixing, editing, and other pro-
cessing you do depends on the power of your computer. So, the more powerful
your computer, the more you can do with your Pro Tools LE or M-Powered
system. Both Pro Tools LE and M-Powered offer a limit of 32 active audio
tracks that you can record or play back. You can have more audio tracks in
your session, but Pro Tools allows you to play only up to 32 at a time.
Pro Tools TDM
Pro Tools TDM systems, such as Pro Tools HD, are processor based, providing
special computer chips that go into the computer to handle all the processing
needs of the software. This takes the load off the computer and guarantees
certain levels of performance. Pro Tools TDM has been the professional stan-
dard because Digidesign hardware (with its own built-in processors) can offer
a stable, reliable, and predictable level of performance. Too, putting the same
processors in your computer can give you the same performance. Your track
limits are much higher with the TDM system compared with the host-based —
up to 192 audio tracks — and these track counts are guaranteed by the
Digidesign DSP (Digital Signal Processing) chips. The downside is that TDM
systems are much more expensive than the LE and M-Powered versions.
As a way of offsetting the higher cost, Digidesign offers a few features to
TDM users that LE and M-Powered users don’t have, such as more and
better plug-ins as well as a few extra editing and mixing options. The good
news is that any recordings you do in your LE or M-Powered system can be
opened in a TDM system (at a commercial studio, for instance) to mix or oth-
erwise process your tracks. This is handy if you want to record at home and
then take it to a pro to mix.
Differences between Macs and PCs
Aside from the obvious hardware and operating system (OS) differences
between Apple- and Windows-based computers, Mac and PC versions of the
Pro Tools software are nearly identical. The only significant difference you’ll
find between the two is the keyboard shortcuts used to perform certain tasks.
Throughout the book, I give both versions of the shortcuts.
Getting Set Up
Before you can do any work in Pro Tools, you have to set up both your hard-
ware and your Playback Engine settings. This section walks you through how
to do this.

Book II
Chapter 3

Basics
Getting Set Up
161
Setting hardware settings
One of the first things you need to do before you start using Pro Tools in
earnest is to configure your hardware settings within the software program.
This is done via the Hardware Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-1. (To
get there, choose Setup➪Hardware Setup from the main menu.) From this
dialog box, you can check out your peripherals as well as set the clock source,
bit rate, and digital input. I give you a rundown of these options in the following
sections.
Peripherals
Located in the upper-left portion of the Hardware Setup dialog box, the
Peripherals pane shows what hardware is hooked up to your computer. In
the case of Figure 3-1, it’s the Digi 002. If you have a Digi 001 or Mbox, you’ll
see either one of those listed in this pane.
Clock Source
From the Clock Source drop-down menu, you choose your source for the digital
master clock, which controls the sample rate capture and playback. This makes
sure that if you have more than one device (a separate analog-to-digital [A/D]
converter connected to your Digidesign interface, for example), all devices are
synchronized. If you just use the Digidesign interface, simply choose Internal from
this menu. If you have other digital devices, such as a digital mixer or an external
converter, choose your clock source based on the device that has the best clock. In
this case, you can choose from the following options:
✦Internal: Uses the digital clock inside the Digidesign interface.
✦S/PDIF (RCA): Synchronizes to a signal sent via the coaxial S/PDIF input.
Figure 3-1:
The
Hardware
Setup dialog
box is

Getting Set Up
162
✦Optical: Synchronizes to a signal coming in the Optical input. The optical
format that is used is based upon whether you select ADAT or S/PDIF in
the upcoming “Optical Format” section.
For more on ADAT, S/PDIF, and Optical connections, check out Book I,
Chapter 2.
Before you can use one of the digital connections as a clock source, you have
to first connect the device to your Digidesign hardware — then you adjust
the setting in the Hardware Setup dialog box. Otherwise, the device won’t
show up in the dialog box.
If you have more than one digital device connected (such as a digital mixer
connected to your Digidesign interface), do some experimenting by recording
with different clock sources and then compare the chosen sources to see
which one gives you the best sound. (Digital clocks vary in quality.) Also, if
you have more than three digital devices connected to your system, consider
using a specialized master clock and distribute this clock source to all your
devices. This will likely give you a better sound because then all your
devices follow the same clock timing.
Optical Format
From this area, choose how the digital inputs on your Digidesign hardware
function. For example, with the Digi 002, you can use the Optical jacks
(located on the back of the device — see Book II, Chapter 2 for more) to
send and receive ADAT or S/PDIF signals. Your two options in this section of
the dialog box are
✦ADAT: Selecting this option means your RCA jacks are disabled (you can
no longer send and receive ADAT signals), and the S/PDIF signals are
sent through the Optical jacks instead.
✦S/PDIF: Selecting this option means that your RCA jacks send and receive
S/PDIF signals while the Optical jacks send and receive ADAT signals.
Sample Rate
From the Sample Rate drop-down menu, choose the sample rate in which to
work. Depending on your hardware, you can choose 44.1, 48, 88.2, or 96 kHz.
Check out Book II, Chapter 2 to see which sample rates are supported by
your Digidesign device. While you’re at it, check out Book I, Chapter 1 for the
nitty-gritty of sample rates.
The Sample Rate drop-down menu is editable only when you don’t have a
session open. If you have a session open, this area shows the sample rate
chosen when this session was created but won’t allow you to make any
changes. To choose a different sample rate

1. Close your open session.
2. Choose Setup➪Hardware Setup from the main menu and make your
choice.
3. Click OK and then open a new session.
The new session is in the sample rate you just chose.
Playing with the Playback Engine settings
The Playback Engine dialog box is where you can tweak various options —
hardware buffer size, CPU usage limit, and playback buffer size, for example —
so your system runs at top efficiency. Getting there — where “there” looks a
lot like Figure 3-2 — involves choosing Setup➪Playback Engine from the
main menu. As for what all these options actually mean, the following sections
take care of that.
H/W Buffer Size
In this context, H/W here stands for Hardware, and the hardware buffer size
controls the amount of memory used to handle the processing of audio (as
well as plug-ins, such as reverb). The lower this setting, the lower the latency
(time it takes to get sound into and back out of your system) that you hear
when you record.
Figure 3-2:
Adjust your
system’s
performance
from the
Playback
Engine
dialog box.

Getting Set Up
164
I suggest keep this setting as low as possible while recording especially when
you do overdubs. How low you can go depends on how many tracks you record
at once whether you want to use plug-ins reverb while recording. Using lots of
tracks and lots of plug-ins requires lots of memory, which force you (rats!) to
bump up the hardware buffer size. Higher buffer sizes mean higher latencies,
which can make overdubbing tracks more difficult, so I reserve high buffer
sizes until after I’m done recording all my tracks.
When you’re ready to mix, go ahead and raise the buffer size. This puts less
stress on your system and allows you to have more plug-ins running before
you run into performance problems.
RTAS Processors
From the RTAS Processors drop-down menu, you can choose the number of
available processors that Pro Tools will use. The number of processors you
can choose depends on how many processors your computer has. My
advice: Choose the highest number possible here.
CPU Usage Limit
From the CPU Usage Limit drop-down menu, set the amount of the computer’s
processing power (as a percentage) used to run the program. The default is
65%, but you can go much higher if you have only Pro Tools open when you
work. The more programs you have open when working in Pro Tools, the lower
the setting you want. Set it as high as you can without affecting the response
of your screen redraws. A good setting to start with is around 75% to 85%.
RTAS Engine
The RTAS Engine check box allows you to avoid seeing an annoying error
message if Pro Tools experiences any errors while you play back or record.
Selecting this check box might result in clicks or pops in the audio if an error
occurs. This is no big deal when you play back your session, but it can be a
problem when you record because these clicks and pops will likely show up
in your audio tracks. I recommend leaving this check box cleared whenever
you record. The only time I select this check box is if I’m working on a rough
mix and don’t want any error messages to stop to flow of my creative
process.
If you’re getting a lot of error messages, reconsider how many plug-ins
you’re using — or maybe upgrade your computer so it can handle more.

Book II
Chapter 3

165
DAE Playback Buffer
The DAE (Digidesign Audio Engine) playback buffer deals with the amount of
memory the audio engine uses to manage the hard drive’s buffers. Again, you
want as low of a setting as you can get without sacrificing system performance.
If the setting is too high, you experience a delay between when you use the
Play command and when Pro Tools starts playing the recording. Using too low
of a setting, on the other hand, can create problems, such as audio dropout (the
sound cuts off) when you record or play back tracks. Start with the default
setting and make adjustments as needed.
The ins and outs of inputs and outputs
Pro Tools allows you to assign your Input, Output, Insert, and Bus routings
as you want. You do this within the I/O Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Choose Setup➪I/O Setup to get there.
Input
From the Input tab of the I/O Setup dialog box, choose and change the name
of the inputs coming from your Digidesign hardware. Simply clicking the Default
button brings up the inputs of the hardware that you connected. To change the
name of any of the inputs, double-click the current name, type in your new one,
and then press Return/Enter. Whatever name you choose shows up in the Input
section of the channel strip in the Mix and Edit windows.
Figure 3-3:
Set your
system’s
routings
from the I/O
Setup dialog
box.

Getting Set Up
166
Customizing the names of your inputs and outputs makes setting up sessions
and remembering where everything is routed much easier. For example, if
you use the S/PDIF inputs as your main microphone inputs (you’d have an
external preamp and an A/D converter between your mic and the interface),
you can name them mic 1 and mic 2 instead of S/PDIF.
Instead of choosing the default setup, you can start from scratch and set up
your own Input routings by clicking the New Path or New Sub-Path buttons.
You can also delete paths if you choose. Additionally, you can import or
export routing settings by clicking the Import Settings or Export Settings
buttons. This can save you time if you have custom settings that you want to
use in all your sessions.
Output
Clicking the Default button on the Output tab of the I/O Setup dialog box dis-
plays the outputs of the hardware connected to your system. Like with the
Input tab of the I/O Setup dialog box, you can change names for the outputs
if you want. The Output tab, however, has three additional options, as shown
in Figure 3-4. These options do the following:
✦Controller Meter Path: This is the output assigned to the master meter
in the Mix window. From this drop-down menu, you can assign any hard-
ware or bus outputs as main outputs so you can know what the levels are.
✦Audition Paths: This is the output where audio regions — the represen-
tations of the audio files in your tracks — play. (Book IV, Chapter 1 has
more on audio regions.)
✦New Track Default Output: Choosing your main output here automati-
cally places this output in every track that you open in your session.
Making your main output your default output means that you don’t have
to choose an Output setting in the Mix or Edit windows whenever you
create a new track.
Figure 3-4:

Insert
Use the Insert tab of the I/O Setup dialog box to set the routing for any 
of your insert effects, such as compressors and limiters. (See Book VI,
Chapter 4 for more on insert effects.)
Bus
The Bus tab of the I/O Setup dialog box has the 32 available buses for your
send/return effects, such as reverb. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 5 for more
on send/return effects.)
Click the Default button for all the settings in the various tabs of the I/O
Setup dialog box, and you’ll be up and running quickly.
Dealing with Sessions
Before you can do any recording, editing, or mixing in Pro Tools, you have to
set up a session in which to work. A session in Pro Tools is simply a song file
that contains all the audio and MIDI tracks, plug-ins, and mixer settings for
all your tracks. Session files don’t actually contain the audio data; instead,
they just have the audio files attached to them.
Creating a new session
To create a new session, choose File➪New Session from the main menu or
press Ô+N (Mac) or Ctrl+N (PC). A dialog box appears, as shown in Figure
3-5, where you can choose the following.
✦Save As: This is where you type the name of this new song.
✦File location: You can choose where you want to save the file on your hard
drive. I recommend that you use the handy New Folder button to create a
new folder for storing the session file and that you name the folder the
same as your session file. This makes a session easy to find on your hard
drive — especially if you haven’t worked on the session for a while.
✦Audio File Type: This drop-down menu lets you choose between BWF
(Broadcast WAV File), AIFF, or SDII files. Choose the one that works best for
you. (I always use BWF files because they’re compatible with other software
I use. Your needs might be different.) If you aren’t transferring your files
from one program to another, I suggest using the default BWF option.
✦Sample Rate: Here, you choose the sample rate of your session. Your
options depend on the Digidesign hardware you have. For example, if
you have a Digi 001 or an Mbox, your choices are between 44.1 kHz and
48 kHz. If you have a Digi 003 or 003 Rack, you can choose between 44.1
kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz.

Dealing with Sessions
168
✦Bit Depth: Here, you can choose between a 16 bit-rate and a 24-bit rate.
Select the 24 Bit radio button.
✦I/O Settings: From this drop-down menu, you can choose between the
most recently used setting or a stereo-mix setting.
The higher the sample rate you select in the New Session dialog box, the
more work your computer processor has to do. You often have to balance
your desire for the highest-resolution music possible against the capabilities
of your system.
The sample rate you choose depends on your goals, intended final format
(CD, for example), and the speed of your computer’s processor. For example,
if your session is going to have a ton of tracks and end up on a CD, your best
bet is to choose 44.1 kHz because that’s where you’ll end up when you record
to CD. Keep in mind, too, that using a whole slew of tracks means that your
computer needs as much processing power as possible to handle mixing and
processing tasks. In this case, recording at 96 kHz would likely put too much
strain on your computer and deprive you of the power to do what you want
during mixing.
Figure 3-5:
The New
Session
dialog box is

169
On the other hand, if you suspect you won’t use very many tracks and want
the highest resolution possible — or if you have a very powerful computer
and won’t go crazy creating multiple tracks — 88.2 kHz or 96 kHz might
better meet your goals.
I recommend getting to know your system before you record a lot of music
with it. Experiment with different sample rates and track counts to see what
your computer can handle. With this information, you can get a good sense
of how hard you can push your system before you reach the limits of its
performance.
Opening sessions
To open a session, choose File➪Open Session from the main menu or press
Ô+O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (PC). The Open Session dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 3-6. Choose the file you want to open and then click Open.
If you have a session with more than 24 tracks and you want to keep those
additional tracks, don’t open it in a Pro Tools version earlier than 5.3 (or if you
do, don’t save it there) because any additional tracks will be lost when you
click Save.
Figure 3-6:
The Open
Session
dialog box.

Dealing with Sessions
170
Saving sessions
You have three options for saving sessions in Pro Tools: Save Session, Save
Session As, and Save Session Copy In. As well, you can always return to a
previously saved version of your session with the Revert to Saved command.
These options are detailed in the next sections.
Save Session
This is the same Save command that you find in any computer program. As
usual, you choose File➪Save to save your session. You can also initiate a
save by pressing Ô+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (PC).
I highly recommend that you get used to saving from the keyboard often to
prevent losing any data while you work. You can also turn on the Auto Save
function and have Pro tools save your session automatically. Here’s how:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences to access the Preferences dialog box.
2. On the Operations tab, select the Enable Session File Auto Backup
check box.
Save Session As
Choose File➪Save Session As to save your session with a new name and/or
location. Figure 3-7 shows the Save Session As dialog box.
Use Save Session As to save a variation of a session that you’ve been working
on. I do this a lot when I’m mixing because this way, I can have a bunch of
different mixes to choose from. The good thing about this command is that 
it saves only the session data and not the audio or MIDI files, so the session
won’t take up much room on your hard drive.

Save Session Copy In
If you want to transfer your files from one program to another (Pro Tools to
Logic, for example), using the Save Session Copy In command can be useful.
Choosing File➪Save Session Copy In opens the dialog box you see in Figure 3-8.
Here, you can change the filename, location, and file type, among other options:
✦Session Format: From this drop-down menu, choose the Pro Tools version
you want to save in. Your options include the current version as well as
PT5.1–6.9, PT5, PT4 24bit, PT4 16bit, and PT 3.2.
Keep in mind that you might lose some data if you save this session in
an earlier version.
✦Session Parameters: Use this section of the dialog box to choose the
audio file type, sample rate, and bit depth. You can choose from the same
options that you had when you first opened the session. Here, you can
also choose to force Mac/PC compatibility. If you want to share this
session between a Mac and a PC, you need to select the Enforce Mac/PC
Compatibility check box. Personally, I leave this check box enabled all
the time just in case I want to transfer my sessions back and forth
between a Mac and a PC.
✦Items to Copy: The Items to Copy section includes options for audio
files, plug-in settings, and movie or video files that might be part of the
session. If you plan on taking this session to another computer, use
Items to Copy function when you choose what you want to copy.

Dealing with Sessions
172
Relying on Revert to Save
The Revert to Save command (choose File➪Revert to Save) is a handy fea-
ture if you did a bunch of work since you last saved your session and want
to undo it without having to use the Undo command (located under Edit
menu) to backtrack through the steps and undo each one.
Personally, if I’m in the position of wanting to undo a bunch of stuff and
haven’t used the Save command since starting those changes, I choose to
save the session with the Save As command. This way, I have those changes
just in case I do decide to keep them. If I go that route, the changes will be
sitting in a separate session file, safe and (ahem) sound.
Using and creating a session template
To make your life easier, you can create a session template with all the
options you want already in place — track settings, window views, mixer set-
tings, and so on — so all you have to do when you open a new session is
open the template and save it with your new session name.
A variety of session templates comes with your Pro Tools Hardware. To use
them, choose the Pro Tools LE Session Templates folder from the Software
CD-ROM and drag it onto your hard drive. Open the template session and
rename it as your new session. You can use this folder for all your templates
so that finding them again is easy. Choose File➪Open session from the main
menu, select the template folder from the Open Session dialog box, and
scroll to the template you want to use.
To prepare a template, start by opening a new session and then creating
your session as you want. After you set all the options to your liking, save
the session file with a name that you’ll remember (like killer session template
1) so you can find it easily.
To transform the session file you saved into a session template, use the
following steps for a Mac or a PC.
Session templates for a Mac
Heads up, you Mac users out there:
1. Click the file to highlight it.

Getting to Know Audio and MIDI Files
174
Getting to Know Audio and MIDI Files
Every time you click the Record button with a track engaged (as I describe in
Book III, Chapter 1, where you can find more on tracks) you create an audio
or MIDI file. This section walks you through what these files are and how to
deal with them.
Understanding audio files
An audio file is the data created from recording onto an audio track. Audio
files in Pro Tools are regions. You can import, export, and edit these regions
in a staggering variety of ways. (Book VI shows you many of the ways to edit
audio.) Whenever you create a new audio file, this region is added to the
Regions list, where you can manage it (as shown in Figure 3-10). The Regions
list is located on the right side of the Edit window. If the list isn’t visible,
click the double arrows at the bottom-right of the Edit window. This expands
the Edit window to include the Regions list view.
Meeting MIDI files
MIDI files are created whenever (you guessed it) you record MIDI data into 
a MIDI track. MIDI tracks don’t contain actual sounds; instead, they consist
of the MIDI performance and system instructions used to control a MIDI
instrument. To have the MIDI data become sound, you have to record the
output of your MIDI sound module (what it does in response to the MIDI file’s
instructions) onto an audio track. Then these sounds are contained in an
audio file.
Figure 3-10:
Audio files

the Regions
list.

Book II
Chapter 3
Examining Software
Basics
Getting to Know Audio and MIDI Files
175
MIDI files show up in the Regions list (along with your session’s audio files),
where you can mange them. MIDI regions have a small circular MIDI jack-
type icon (shown on the left side in Figure 3-11) to help you identify them.
You can choose to see only the MIDI regions in the Regions list (as shown in
Figure 3-11) by choosing Show from the Regions drop-down menu and the
selecting the MIDI option (or by clearing the Audio, Auto Generated, and
Groups options).
Finding your session files
Whenever you open a session in Pro Tools, the program has to go out and find
all the audio and MIDI files associated with that session before the session will
actually open. If Pro Tools can’t find the files — you moved them, for instance —
the Missing Files dialog box opens. There, you can choose to skip the file, let
Pro Tools search for it automatically, or search for it manually. (See Figure 3-12
for a look at the Missing Files dialog box.) I always choose the automatic-search
option — it finds the missing file nearly every time. The only time that hasn’t
worked for me is when I’ve moved a file to another hard drive. (Then I select
the Manually Find & Relink radio button.)
After your session opens, all the audio and MIDI files (regions) for that session
are displayed in the Audio Regions list in the Edit window. Not only can you
manage the files from these lists, but you can also import files that were orig-
inally recorded in another session — or even using another recording program
(such as Logic or Nuendo).

ecognizing that recording is a complex process, Pro Tools gives you
three distinct windows in which to work: Transport, Mix, and Edit. Each
window performs a certain set of functions and gives you control of a specific
set of details. These are outlined in this chapter. These windows are the heart
and soul of Pro Tools. The more comfortable you are navigating them, the
easier life will be as you create your masterpieces.
Tackling the Transport Window
At its most basic level, the Transport window — see Figure 4-1 — acts like
the transport mechanism of a tape deck that moves the tape past the record
and playback heads: It controls the digital processes that correspond to
recording, playing, stopping, rewinding, and so on. On a deeper level, how-
ever, it also offers a host of other functions. This section details all the
Transport window’s functions.
Adjusting the Transport window
Some people salivate at the thought of information overkill, while others live
by the maxim, “Less is more.” Pro Tools is smart enough to accommodate
Figure 4-1:
The
Transport
window
acts like

controls.

Tackling the Transport Window
178
both schools of thought. In case you don’t want all the information (and the
accompanying clutter) present in the Transport window as shown in Figure
4-1, you can show or hide parts of it as you choose. You can find the com-
mands for paring down the size of the Transport window under the View
menu at the top of the main Pro Tools window. Just choose View➪Transport
and then choose from the options listed — Counters, MIDI Controls, and
Expanded — as shown in Figure 4-2.
Basic controls
The upper-left portion of the Transport window is home to your basic, tradi-
tional transport controls. If you honed your recording skills on a tape deck,
you’ll be right at home. Taking a look at Figure 4-3, you’ll find (going from left
to right) the following:
✦Online: Engaging this button allows you to control record and playback
with an external device. Before you can use this feature, you need to
connect your device and specify its synchronization settings in Pro
Tools. (Check out the Synchronization section of the Pro Tools Reference
guide that came with your software for details on how to do this.)
✦Return to Zero: Clicking this button takes you back to the beginning of
the session. You can also press Return/Enter if you prefer to use your
keyboard instead of the mouse.
✦Rewind: Clicking this button “rewinds” the session in one of two ways,
providing a fine-tuned control that’s really hard to get with the mechanics
of a tape deck:

• Click Rewind and hold down the mouse button. The session rewinds
until you release the mouse button. One cool thing about this way of
rewinding is that when you release the Rewind button, a marker is
placed in the song, and all you have to do to rewind back to that point
is hit the Stop button. The session goes right back to that point. (This
is great if you want check the same spot several times — for example,
to make sure that new guitar part comes in right on cue.)
• Click the button. Each click rewinds the session a prescribed amount,
depending on the time-scale setting displayed in your main counter
(more about that in the next section). For example, if you have your
main counter set up to display bars (measures) and beats, clicking
the Rewind button moves the session back one bar of music. If you
have min:seconds or samples showing in the display, the session
moves back in one-second increments.
✦Stop: Clicking Stop simply stops the session. (You can get the same thing
done much faster, though, by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard —
no fumbling with the mouse required.)
✦Play: Clicking the Play button starts the session. Simply clicking the 
Play button (or pressing the spacebar) starts playback; clicking the
Record button first and then the Play button starts recording, as long as
you have a track enabled to record. Book III, Chapter 3 covers this in
detail.
✦Fast Forward: To move quickly through the session, just use the Fast
Forward button. You can use Fast Forward one of two ways:
• Press Fast Forward and hold down the mouse button. The session fast-
forwards until you release the mouse button. Depending on whether
you were playing the session when you press and hold the button or
the session was stopped, releasing the Fast Forward button can
either return you to play mode or stop the session at that point.
• Click the button. Each click forwards the session a prescribed amount
based upon the time scale setting displayed in your main counter (see
the next section). For example, if you have your main counter set up to
display bars and beats, clicking the Fast Forward button moves the ses-
sion forward one bar of music. If you have min:seconds or samples set
in the display, the session moves forward by one-second increments.
✦Go to End: Clicking this button takes you to the end of the session. If
you don’t want to use your mouse, you can also press Option+Return
(Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (PC).
✦Record: Clicking the Record button readies your session to record any
enabled tracks. (Book III, Chapter 3 talks about this more.) You need to
have at least one track enabled for this function to work. You’ll be alerted
if you don’t. If you don’t want to use the mouse, you can ready recording
by pressing Ô+spacebar (Mac) or Ctrl+spacebar (PC). To actually
record, you need to click the Play button after clicking Record.

180
In addition to readying recording, you can toggle through the different
Record modes by pressing the Control key while you click with your
mouse (Mac) or right-click (PC). These Record modes are covered in
detail in Book III, Chapter 4, but here is an overview:
• Nondestructive: This Record mode is indicated (rather subtly) by not
showing an icon in the Record button; it doesn’t delete any previous
takes (a recorded performance) on that track.
• Destructive: This mode — indicated by a small D in the center of the
Record button — records over the track, destroying any previous
takes as it does so.
Don’t use Destructive mode unless you absolutely don’t want the
previous take, because it’s gone forever.
• Loop: This mode — indicated by a loop graphic inside the Record
button — allows you to repeatedly record over a selected section of
your track (called, curiously enough, a loop). It’s a handy function if
you have a section that might need more than one try to get right
because when you’re done recording a take, it returns you to the
start of the looped section and begins recording over again. Each
loop through the section is saved and added to your track’s playlist
where you can choose the best one later.
• Quick-punch: This mode is indicated by a P in the center of the Record
button. Quick-punch allows you to automatically punch in and out of
a section of a song. For example, if your bass player just laid down a
killer part except for two lousy notes, you can rerecord just those notes
on the fly by punching in (start recording) just before the notes and
punching out (stop recording) right after them.
Counters
The Counters section of the Transport window tells you where you are in the
session. This section contains only the main counter for your session.
If the Counters section isn’t visible, choose View➪Transport➪Counter (to
see the main counter) — or View➪Transport➪Expanded (to see the rest of
the counters listed in this section). Figure 4-4 shows how the Transport
window looks with both these options selected.
Figure 4-4:
The
Counters
and

Tackling the Transport Window
181
The Counters section of the Transport window is home to the main counter,
which is located in the center of the window and shows where you are in the
session. There is a drop-down menu located to the right of this counter where
you can choose the format — bars:beats, min:seconds, samples — to be
displayed. Simply click the white triangle and choose the format you desire.
Expanded
The Expanded section of the Transport window shows a secondary counter
for your session as well as additional goodies to help you get around your
session. These include pre- and post-roll setting; a transport master selector
for synchronizing Pro Tools with other devices; and start, end, and length
times for selections. These are all shown in Figure 4-4.
The Expanded section of the Transport window contains the following dis-
play extras:
✦Secondary counter: Below the main counter is a secondary counter 
for your session. You can select the format displayed by opening the
drop-down menu to the right of the counter. Again, your choices are
bars:beats, min:seconds, and samples. This lets you have two different
counters displayed at one time, which is handy if you want to see where
you are in your session in two different formats, such as min:seconds
and bars:beats.
✦Pre-roll: Pre-roll allows you to choose an amount of time that the session
plays before the timeline of your session begins or wherever you have the
Start cursor. This is useful if you use a click track (the equivalent of an
electronic metronome) or want to do some punch recording; whoever’s
playing can use it to get used to the tempo before you start to record. (See
the “MIDI controls” section, later in this chapter, for more on using a click
track. See Book III, Chapter 4 for more on punch recording.)
You choose the amount of your pre-roll by clicking in the value in the
Pre-roll counter and then either typing a new value or (with the mouse
button held down) scrolling up or down. Engage the Pre-roll function by
clicking the Pre-roll button next to the counter.
✦Post-roll: Post-roll is pretty much like Pre-roll except that in this case
(surprise, surprise), you tack on a specified amount of time after the
session ends (or wherever the timeline End point is set).
You choose the length of your post-roll by clicking in the value in the
Post-roll counter and typing a new value — or, with your mouse held
down, scrolling up or down. Engage the Post-roll function by clicking
the Post-roll button next to the counter.
✦Transport Master: The drop-down menu of the Transport Master box
lets you choose a specific device to be the “master” of the main Transport
functions (play, record, stop, and so on). You find two sub-menus here:
Transport and Online. In the Transport sub-menu, you can choose the

Tackling the Transport Window
182
Transport Master from several options, including MMC (MIDI Machine
Control), MIDI, and Machine. (Machine refers to the Digidesign Machine
Control software, which you have to buy from Digidesign. This is used for
post-production and film work.) From the Online sub-menu, you can
choose to bring specific devices on- or off-line. The devices available will
depend on the currently selected Transport Master.
If you want to get into synchronizing Pro Tools with other devices, check
out the Digidesign reference manual for details on how to do this. If you
have no other control devices synchronized to Pro Tools, then this box
reads Transport = Pro Tools.
✦Start: Use the Start counter to set the beginning of a range within which
you can play or record. You choose this starting point by clicking in the
counter window and then typing in the value, or clicking and holding
with your mouse (scrolling up or down to get the value you want).
✦End: The End counter shows you where the play or record range ends.
You can choose this endpoint by clicking in the counter window and then
typing in the value, or clicking and holding with your mouse (scrolling
up or down to get the value you want).
✦Length: The Length counter shows the length of the play range created
with the Start and End counters. Like with the other counters, you can
type in a value by clicking in the counter window first, or you can click
and hold your mouse button while you scroll up or down.
Typing in a value other than what is shown after you set the Start and
End counter changes the placement of the End counter.
MIDI controls
The MIDI controls section is located on the right side of the Transport
window. (If it’s not showing in your Transport window, choose View➪
Transport➪MIDI Controls.) The MIDI Controls section, as shown on the right
side of Figure 4-5, includes the following.

✦Wait for Note: Clicking this button lets Pro Tools know it should wait to
start recording until it receives a musical note from a MIDI device. This
allows you to ensure that your first note is precisely at the beginning of
the recorded section.
✦Click: Clicking this button turns on and off the metronome signal sent
through the MIDI out of your MIDI interface.
Double-clicking this button opens the Click/Countoff Options dialog box
(see Figure 4-6) where you can choose various Click parameters, including
when the click sounds, what note it transmits, and what MIDI port
(output) it uses.
✦Countoff: Clicking this button turns on and off a specified count-off of
the length chosen at the bottom of the Click/Countoff dialog box (see
Figure 4-6). (Double-clicking the Countoff button opens this dialog box.)
You can set the countoff to sound only during recording or during both
recording and playback. You type in the length of this count-off in the
Bars text box in the Click/Countoff Options dialog box. This number
shows up in the Countoff button after the dialog box is closed.
✦MIDI Merge: With this selector, you can either merge your recorded
MIDI data with existing MIDI data on the record-enabled track or erase
the existing data and replace it with the new stuff. Engaging the button
lets you merge data.
✦Conductor: Clicking this button turns on the tempo map defined in the
Tempo line of the Edit window. (See “Examining the Edit Window,” later
in this chapter, for more on the Tempo line.) You create this map by
double-clicking the Meter button (described next).
Alternatively, you can disable this button and choose a tempo by manually
entering it (more about choosing the tempo in a minute).
Figure 4-6:
Choose
click and

Examining the Edit Window
184
✦Meter: This button shows you the time signature for the present section
of the session. Double-click the time signature, and a dialog box opens,
allowing you to specify time signature (meter), tempo, and start point
for these values. With this dialog box, you can set up a tempo map, which
is a scheme describing tempo changes for your entire song, no matter
how complex. (Book III, Chapter 3 details how to create a tempo map.)
✦Note: When the Conductor button is not engaged, the Note icon tells you
what value note the metronome is sounding. Click this icon, and a drop-
down menu opens, letting you choose the value from whole notes to six-
teenth notes.
✦Tempo: With the Conductor button engaged, this box simply shows you
what tempo the current section of the session is in. With the Conductor
button disabled, you can manually enter any tempo you like. You can do
this in three ways:
• Type it in. Click in the box where the tempo is displayed, type in a
number (in beats per minute), and then press Return/Enter. The
metronome and counters play at this tempo.
• Slide it in. Adjust the horizontal slider located under the Conductor,
Meter, and Tempo buttons to choose your tempo. Slide to the right,
and you get a faster tempo; slide left for a slower one.
• Tap it in. By pressing the T key on your keyboard, you can set Pro
Tools to a tempo without having to know exactly how many beats
per minute you want. (This is a great feature for people who aren’t
comfortable with metronome numbers.)
Examining the Edit Window
The Edit window, as shown in Figure 4-7, is where you’ll do most of your
work. Here, everything is set up in a timeline so you can see what’s happening
in the session while it plays. This window contains a variety of tracking infor-
mation, including inputs and outputs, sends, inserts, and automations data. The
Edit window also has the tools you need to do audio and MIDI data editing, such
as creating, arranging, and editing specific regions of an audio track.
The list is almost endless. Don’t fret though; everything you need to know to
use this window effectively is in this section.

Taking a look at track controls
Each track, whether audio or MIDI, is shown in the Edit window. These run
horizontally underneath the Timeline section of the window. Figure 4-8 gives
you a close-up view of the track section of the Edit window.
Basic controls
On the far left of the track section of the Edit window are some basic con-
trols. These include the following:
✦Track Name: Double-click this button (which shows the name of the
track) to open a window where you can the track’s name and also add
some comments. (All comments show up in the Comments section of
the expanded Edit window or in the Mix window.)
✦Playlist selector: Click and hold this button to open a drop-down menu
that allows you to choose from edit playlists. (See Book IV, Chapter 1 for
more on editing playlists.)
✦Record Enable: Click this button to enable the track for recording.
✦Solo: Clicking this button solos a track — turns off the rest of the tracks —
in a mix.
Figure 4-7:

186
✦Mute: Clicking this button turns off this track.
✦Track View selector: Click and hold this button to open a menu that lets
you choose different views in the Timeline section of the track in the
session. Your options include Blocks, Waveform, Volume, Mute, and Pan.
✦Track Height selector: Clicking this arrow opens a drop-down menu
from which you choose the height of the track data display. You choices
include Mini, Small, Medium, Large, Jumbo, Extreme, and Fit to Window.
✦Automation Mode selector: Click and hold this button to open a menu
that lets you choose from various automation modes, including Off,
Read, Touch, Latch, and Write. Each of these display modes shows the
waveform in the background and the setting for the automation data in
the foreground. (Book VI, Chapter 6 has more on automation modes and
how to use them.)
✦Voice selector: Clicking this button turns the track on and off. Click and
hold this button to choose between Dyn (the track is heard if it has data
in it) and Off (the track doesn’t sound, even if it has an audio or MIDI file
attached to it). Because Pro Tools LE allows you to have only 32 active
voices (24 on versions 5.3.1 and earlier), you can use this selector to
keep a track from occupying one of those voices.

Optional windows in the track section
You can enhance your Edit window view by adding information from the Mix
window for each track. Just choose View➪Edit Window➪All from the main
menu, and you’ll end up with something that looks like Figure 4-9. This is a
handy feature if you have only one monitor and you want to be able to see
the comments, inserts, sends, and I/O settings (or any combination) for each
track without having to open the Mix window. (Not sure what inserts, sends,
and I/O settings actually are? Don’t worry. I detail those in the “Managing the
Mix Window” section, later in this chapter.)
One of the really cool things in this section of the expanded window is that
you can actually open a channel strip for an individual track by clicking the
small fader icon located at the lower right of the I/O settings window. Click
the icon again, and the channel strip disappears. Figure 4-10 shows the chan-
nel strip after being called up from the Edit window. (This feature is so
handy that I rarely use the Mix window anymore.)

Examining edit modes
Editing in Pro Tools is done on regions. Regions are representations of the
audio or MIDI files stored on your hard drive. What makes editing this way
so powerful is that when you change a region, you aren’t actually changing
the audio file itself. (There are some exclusions to this, which are covered in
Book IV, Chapters 3 and 4; and Book V, Chapter 3.) Instead, you’re changing
only how Pro Tools plays it back.
When you want to move regions around in Pro Tools, you have four edit modes
in which to work: Shuffle, Spot, Slip, and Grid, as shown in Figure 4-11. These
are located in the upper-left corner of the Edit Window. The following list
describes each of these modes.
✦Shuffle: In this mode, you can shuffle a region and place it automatically
at the end of the nearest region. For example, if you want to move the
second bar of a four-bar phrase to the last bar, all you have to do is create
a separate region for each bar, grab it by clicking it with the Grabber tool,
and move it over to the end. (Book IV, Chapter 2 explains, in detail, how to
do this.) The third bar moves over to replace the second; the original
second bar snaps right to the end of the fourth bar. This mode is handy
for shuffling regions while making sure that you don’t have any overlap or
dead space between them.
✦Spot: You can use this mode to designate the exact timeline placement
of a region you want to move. When you click a region with Spot mode
active, a dialog box pops up, asking you to enter the start point. Do so
and click OK; the selected region is placed right where you want it.
✦Slip: Use this mode to move regions anywhere you want with your mouse
by selecting them any of the ways described in Book IV, Chapter 2. You
can have regions overlap or leave space between them, for instance.
✦Grid: This mode enables you to move regions to a time grid — user-
defined divisions of your session. You can set the time grid’s scale by
choosing Tools➪Grid Value in the main Edit window. You can choose
from two types of grids: Absolute and Grid. I detail these in Book IV,
Chapter 1.
For more detailed information on these edit modes, check out Book IV,
Chapter 1.

Zeroing in on Zoom controls
The Zoom controls (see Figure 4-12) are located next to the Edit Mode selectors.
Use these buttons to fit a good working view of your audio and MIDI regions
into your screen by specifying horizontal and vertical zoom (as the following
list makes clear).
✦Horizontal Zoom: These outer two Zoom buttons control the horizontal
zoom of the timeline as well as all audio and MIDI tracks and regions.
Clicking the left button narrows the view; clicking the right button
lengthens it.
✦Vertical Zoom: These two center Zoom buttons control vertical zoom for
audio and MIDI: The button for audio is at center-left, and the one for MIDI
is at center-right. Clicking the arrow at the top of either button increases
the height of the display; clicking the arrow at the bottom decreases the
height.
✦Zoom Presets: At the bottom of the Zoom Controls section are five
easily programmable presets. On a Mac, you simply Ô-click any one of
the five buttons to assign your present setting to that button. On a PC, a
Ctrl-click does the trick. The Zoom settings are saved, and you can recall
them by clicking the assigned preset number.
Elucidating edit tools
Pro Tools has some powerful editing features, easily accessible from the Edit
toolbar, found next to the Zoom controls at the top of the Edit window.
Figure 4-13 shows you what the toolbar icons for these tools look like, and
the following list tells you what the tools can do for you.
✦Zoomer: The Zoomer tool does much the same thing as the Horizontal
Zoom tool, with a handy editing advantage: It zooms right to the point
that you click with your mouse or the area you click and drag across.
✦Standard Trimmer: This tool lets you change the size of a region by
clicking the beginning or end of the region and then sliding it to where
you want it.
Figure 4-12:
The Zoom
controls.

Examining the Edit Window
190
✦Selector: Use the Selector tool to highlight a spot within a region so you
can cut, paste, or do whatever you want with it. All you have to do is
click and drag the mouse over the section you want to select.
✦Grabber: In general terms, the Grabber tool lets you grab a region to
move around your session. It has two options (which you can view if
you click and hold the mouse button with the pointer over the tool): the
Time and the Separation tools. (Note: Whichever tool you used last is
the default tool until you select the other.)
• Time: The Time Grabber tool lets you select an entire region and
then move it anywhere within (and between) tracks. You simply click
the region with your mouse, hold down the button, and then drag the
region to where you want it.
• Separation: The Separation Grabber tool lets you move a portion of a
region within or between tracks. To select a portion to move, use the
Selector tool described earlier in this list.
✦Scrubber: Use the Scrubber tool to listen to a region without having to
play the entire track. To use this tool, click the region and drag it forward
to hear the audio play forward. Drag the mouse back along the region to
hear the audio play backward. This tool is handy when you want to
locate a specific note in the audio region.
✦Pencil: Use the Pencil tool to redraw audio waveforms (great for draw-
ing over clipped notes, for example); to do MIDI editing, such as insert-
ing or deleting notes; or draw automation settings, among other things.
(Book IV, Chapter 3 explains waveform editing in detail.) Clicking and
holding this button opens a pop-up menu that offers seven Pencil types
(as shown in Figure 4-14) as well as the Customize Note Duration option
to use. (For more on custom note durations, see Book IV, Chapter 3.)
✦Smart tool: This tool combines the functions of the Standard Trimmer,
Selector, and Grabber tools. It changes how the cursor works according
to where you are within a region, automatically becoming the appropriate
tool for that section. This keeps you from having to constantly switch
tools as you work. (Ah, progress.)

Looking at counter displays
The Edit window has two distinct counter displays; for each display, you
have a choice among three different formats — bars and beats, minutes and
seconds, and samples — for showing where you actually are in the session.
You choose your format from a drop-down menu that you access by clicking
the small arrow located to the right of the display, as shown in Figure 4-15.
This is a handy feature for being able to see where you are in your session.
For example, I find that having my main counter to bars and beats, and the
secondary counter set to minutes and seconds helps me keep track of where
I am in the session and how that relates to the actual length of the tune. This
is especially important if I have a tune that has to conform to a certain time
limit (because I prefer to work in beats and bars).
Evaluating the Event Edit area
Next to the counter displays are the Event Edit displays. (See Figure 4-16.)
These displays show the start point, end point, and length of a selected region
in the same format as the main counter display. (See the previous section for
more on counter displays.) If you choose a specific MIDI note to examine,
another window opens that shows you the pitch, note velocity, and release
velocity of that note.
You can use the display to choose particular regions by clicking in the
window and typing in the values you want. Press Return/Enter to activate
the selection.

Instead of typing start points and end points into the Event Edit display, you
can use the blue arrows in the Rulers section of the Edit window to choose
your start point and end point, as shown in Figure 4-17. Click and drag each
arrow to where you want it. You can also use the Selector tool and click and
drag across the area you want to select. Book IV, Chapter 2 explains these
options in detail.
The Black Bar hodgepodge
You’ll find Edit Mode buttons, Zoom controls, Edit tools, Location displays,
and Event Edit displays — all the stuff I talked about so far in this chapter —
marching along the very top of the Edit window. Right beneath all these features,
however, is a thin black toolbar that plays host to yet another variety of useful
tools. (Refer to Figure 4-7 to see the black toolbar in all its glory.) The following
list gives you the goods on what each tool can do for you:
✦Track View: Use the Track View tool to choose different view formats for
the Track section (the left-most column) of the Edit window. Clicking the
down arrow calls up a drop-down menu from which you can choose
Comments, Instrument, Inserts, Sends, I/O, Real-Time Properties, Track
Color, All, or None.
✦Ruler View: Use the Ruler View tool to choose different view formats for
the Ruler section, which is the section running horizontally along the
top of the Edit window. Clicking the down arrow calls up a drop-down
menu, where you can choose to see Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds, Samples,
Markers, Tempo, Meter, Key Signatures, All, or None. The selection(s)
you make here appear in the Timebase ruler section of the Edit window.
(Check out the “Rulers rule!” section later in this chapter for details on
the Timebase ruler.)

✦Linearity Display Mode: Click the Linearity Display Mode button to
choose how the Edit window shows your session timescale. You have
two options:
• Linear Sample Display: You see your session in samples.
• Linear Tick Display: You see your session in bars and beats.
✦Tab to Transients: The Tab to Transients button, when engaged, allows
you to press the Tab key on your keyboard and move from transient to
transient in the highlighted audio track. (A transient, by the way, is the
loud initial attack that first attracts your attention to a sound.)
I love this feature for separating drum loops from a track. I simply
engage this button, locate my cursor close to the start of my loop, and
press the Tab key to go right at the start of the section I want to cut.
Without this feature, I’d be messing around for quite a while, finding the
exact start point of the part I want to separate.
✦Keyboard Focus: Clicking the Command Keyboard Focus button toggles
the Keyboard Focus option on and off. What is the Keyboard Focus
option, you ask? Well, here’s the short answer: This option allows you to
use your keyboard to perform shortcuts; for example, you can select
regions from the MIDI or audio lists (see the “Looking at lists” section
later in this chapter), perform an edit, or enable or disable groups. For
the long answer — as in, How do you actually use keyboard shortcuts? —
these shortcuts are interspersed throughout the book for each com-
mand as I describe them.
✦Link Timeline and Edit Selection: By default, the Timeline and Edit
selections are linked so that if you choose a section to edit, the Timeline
start and end times coincide with the start and end times of this selec-
tion, as shown on the left in Figure 4-18. Sometimes you want to be able
to have a timeline setting remain unchanged as you select a different
place to edit, as on the right in Figure 4-18. (In this case, click the Link
Timeline and Edit Selection button once to turn linking off; click again to
turn linking back on.)

✦Link Track and Edit Selection: When you have the Link Track and Edit
Selection option engaged, making a selection in a track also highlights
the track itself. This allows you to select several tracks and make adjust-
ments to these tracks, such as adding them to a group or toggling the
track view.
✦Mirrored MIDI Editing: The Mirrored MIDI Editing function lets you
globally edit all MIDI regions with the same name. This means that if you
have a MIDI region that you use more than once per song and you want
to change them all, clicking this button lets you make the change only
once instead of for each time the region exists in your session.
✦Grid Value: This display shows the value for the Edit window’s grid —
the boundary lines for your session. The grid boundary value appears in
the same format as the main time scale — bars:beats, min: seconds, or
samples — unless you choose otherwise from the drop-down menu,
where you also choose the boundary resolution for the grid itself. This is
a great function when you want to move regions around in a tune and
have them align to certain locations. For example, if I move drum
grooves, I can have them snap right to the beginning of a bar by setting
the grid value to 1 measure and moving the region close to the start of
the measure.
✦Nudge Value: The Nudge Value display shows the setting for the dis-
tance that a region is moved with each press of the plus and minus keys
on your keyboard. Clicking the down arrow calls up a drop-down menu,
as shown in Figure 4-19, where you can choose this nudge value. Note
that you can choose a number of different ways how your distances are
to be measured — Bars:Beats, Min:Secs, Samples, or Regions/Markers.
✦Cursor: The Cursor display tracks where your cursor is in the timeline
as well as the location of the sound wave in the selected track. (See
Figure 4-20.)

display tells
you the

Looking at lists
In the humdrum world, it’s hard to get excited about laundry lists and shopping
lists. In the world of Pro Tools, however, lists are something to crow about
because they can help you keep track of your tracks, audio regions, MIDI
regions, and groups.
The lists for your tracks, edit groups, audio files, and MIDI files are displayed
on either side of the Edit window. To keep track of — and/or manipulate —
any of these lists, you’re going to want to familiarize yourself with one more
list of features:
✦Show/Hide Tracks: The Show/Hide Tracks list lets you choose which
tracks get displayed in your Edit and Mix windows. As shown in Figure
4-21, you can choose to show all tracks, hide all tracks, or to show/hide
only those tracks you already selected. This menu is opened by clicking
and holding over the Tracks title at the left side of the Edit window. (Refer
to Figure 4-7.) If the Show/Hide section of the window isn’t visible, click
the double arrows at the far lower left of the Edit window. The Show/Hide
and Edit Groups (see the next bullet) section appear.
✦Edit Groups: In Pro Tools, you can group selected tracks and perform an
edit on them all at the same time. This is called working with an Edit
Group. These groups are displayed in the Edit Groups list and clicking
the name of the group toggles the enabling of a group on and off. You can
also create, delete, modify, or suspend groups by clicking and holding the
Edit Groups title at the top of the groups list and then choosing an option
from the drop-down menu that appears, as shown in Figure 4-22.

✦Regions: The Regions list in Pro Tools contains representations of the
audio and MIDI files associated with your session. The Regions list shows
all the audio and MIDI regions that are part of your session. You can do a
host of things to these regions, such as renaming, clearing, exporting,
and compacting.
These functions are performed by opening the drop-down menu shown
in Figure 4-23. To open this menu, click and hold the Regions title at the
top of the Regions list. If the Regions list isn’t open in your session, click
the double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Edit window to open it.
Rulers rule!
Lists hover discretely to the left or right of the Edit window. Rulers (as you
might expect) lord over the top of the Edit window and are masters of all
they survey.
In Pro Tools-speak, rulers are actually referred to as Timebase rulers; they
show you where you are within the session (see Figure 4-24). The Timebase
Rulers section of the Edit window also lets you view the time, tempo, meter,
and markers of a session. The following list gives details on the four timelines.

✦Time: You have a choice between the now-familiar formats of Bars:Beats,
Min:Secs, and Samples. By default, this timeline shows the same time
format as the main counter, but it’s easy to change to one of the other
formats. Just choose View➪Rulers and then choose the format you want
included in the Timebase Rulers section, as shown in Figure 4-25.
✦Tempo: The Tempo timeline shows you all the tempos and tempo changes
in your section. But there’s more! With the Tempo timeline, you can
quickly change the tempos in the session by clicking the plus sign to the
right of the Tempo title all the way to the right side of the figure. Doing so
opens the Tempo Meter Change dialog box, where you can enter a new
tempo for the session. Book III, Chapter 3 goes into detail about creating
Tempo changes in your session via the Tempo Editor.
If you don’t plan on having any tempo changes and really don’t want to
see the Tempo timeline, you can hide it by choosing View➪Rulers from
the main menu and then deselecting the Tempo option.
✦Meter: This timeline shows the meters (time signatures) contained in
your session. To change the meter, click the plus icon to the right of the
Meter title all the way to the right side of the figure. This opens the
Tempo Meter Change dialog box.
If you prefer not to see this timeline, you can hide it by choosing
View➪Rulers from the main menu and then deselecting the Meter option.
✦Key: The Key timeline shows the musical key signature of the sections of
your session. Here, you can change the key of your song. Clicking the +
sign on the right of the key title opens the Key Change dialog box (seen
in Figure 4-26). Here, you can make any changes to the key signature of
your session.
If you prefer not to see this timeline, you can hide it by choosing
View➪Rulers➪Key Signature from the main menu and then deselecting
the Key Signature option.

✦Markers: The Markers timeline shows the position of session markers.
(For more on session markers, see Book IV, Chapter 2.) Clicking the plus
icon to the right of the marker’s name opens a dialog box where you can
enter your marker information, as shown in Figure 4-27.
Markers are great for quickly locating sections of your tune. For exam-
ple, pacing a marker at the start of the verses and choruses can make
moving between them a breeze. You can even use markers in Pro Tools
to recall visual settings (such as track height and zoom settings) or
record and playback options (such as pre- and post-roll times) as well as
enabling grouped tracks for speedy editing.

Managing the Mix Window
The Mix window is like a standard mixer, housing channel strips of each track
type available in Pro Tools. Not only do these track types include audio, MIDI,
auxiliary, and master tracks (as shown in Figure 4-28), but you can also choose
various views of the channel strips, from a basic view to expanded views
showing comments, inserts, and sends. Moreover, in addition to all your
channel strips, the Mix window can list all the tracks in your session, along
with any grouped tracks you might have created.
I know this sounds like a lot to keep track of (so to speak), but don’t worry. The
upcoming sections fill you in on all you need to know to keep things straight.
Figure 4-28:
The Mix
window is

Checking out channel strips
Each track in the Mix window has its own channel strip, and these channel
strips perform the same kinds of tasks you’d see channel strips doing in a
hardware mixer, such as volume control, panning, effects sends and inserts,
mute and solo switches, automation, input and output routing, and enabling
recording. The Mix window can handle pretty much any kind of track you
can imagine, including the track types covered in the next few sections.
Audio track
Your audio track is your basic meat-and-potatoes track, the main building
block in your sonic universe. Getting the audio track to do exactly what you
want takes a lot of work. Pro Tools is well aware of this fact, and therefore
provides you with a full-featured tool palette so you can take care of business.
More specifically, the audio track’s channel strip contains the following tools
(as shown from top to bottom in Figure 4-29):
✦Input: Clicking the Input button opens a drop-down menu where you can
choose the sound source that feeds the track. It can either be a physical
input from your hardware interface, or it can be a bus (an internal signal
path; see Book I, Chapter 3 for more on buses). The hardware you use
(Digi 002, Mbox, or whatever) determines the number of inputs you have
to choose from.
✦Output: This button controls the output of the track — where the sound
goes when it leaves the track. Like the input selector button (see the
preceding bullet), clicking it opens a menu that lets you choose from
either the hardware outputs of your interface or any of 16 buses (inter-
nal signal paths) available in Pro Tools.
✦Automation Mode: In Pro Tools, automation means having certain mix
parameters — such as volume, panning, mute, send level, and insert
level — adjust dynamically throughout the session. Use this button to
choose between the different automation modes, including Off, Read,
Touch, Latch, or Write. (Book VI, Chapter 6 details these automation
modes.)
✦Panning: Use the slider to pan your track to the left or right in the stereo
field, which is sort of the audio equivalent of a movie scene. (For more
on panning, see Book VI, Chapter 1.)
✦Panning Display: This display shows you your track’s panning position —
its place left, right or center, in the stereo field.
✦Solo/Mute: Clicking these buttons either solo or mute the track. (For
more on soloing/muting, see Book VI, Chapter 1.)
✦Record Enable: Clicking the Record Enable button enables the track for
recording. When enabled, this button flashes red.

✦Voice Dyn/Off: This selector lets you choose between
• Dynamic: The track plays if data is present.
• Off: The track does not play.
✦Volume fader: This is the control for setting the volume of the audio
contained in this track.
✦Velocity meter: This display, located to the right of the Volume fader,
shows you the volume (velocity, in Pro Tools-speak) of the track while
the music plays. Any notes above digital 0 show in red at the top of the
display.
✦Group: A little letter is present if this track is grouped with others. The
letter itself tells you which group the track is a part of. If the letter is
capitalized, the track belongs to more than one group. You can make
changes to the group by clicking the icon to open a dialog box.
✦Track Type: This icon shows you what type of track it is. In Figure 4-29,
the small waveform lets you know that this is an audio track.
✦Numerical Volume: This display shows you the volume of the track in
decibels.
✦Track name: This tells you the name of the track. You can change the
name at any time by clicking the name and typing in a new one.

MIDI track
The MIDI track, as shown in Figure 4-30, shares many of the features of the
audio track, but some important differences exist, as the following list makes
clear:
✦Input: The Input button lets you choose the MIDI input feeding this
track. Clicking the button opens a drop-down menu from which you can
choose the MIDI port and channel(s) that you want to receive MIDI data
from.
✦Output: The Output button lets you choose the physical MIDI output
that you want to assign the track to — any of the 16 MIDI channels (or
choose All).
✦Patch select: This button (located below the channel fader) lets you
change the sound that comes out of your MIDI hardware when a note is
played. Clicking this button opens the MIDI Patch Select dialog box, in
which you enter the program number or name of the sound to want the
track to play. This lets you change sounds throughout the session.
✦Track type: This MIDI track icon looks like a MIDI port.
Instrument track
The instrument track, as shown in Figure 4-31, is a blend of the audio and
MIDI tracks. Here’s how it lays out:
✦Instruments Section: You can open this section of the Instrument Track
channel strip by choosing View➪Mix➪Instrument. This expands the top
of the mix window to include controls for choosing your instrument

source. You can see this at the top of Figure 4-31. You have the following
options here:
• MIDI Input selector: Use this Input button to choose the MIDI input
feeding this track. Clicking the button opens a drop-down menu from
which you can choose the MIDI port and channel(s) from which you
want to receive MIDI data.
• MIDI Output selector: Use this Output button to choose the MIDI
output to which you want to assign the track — any of the 16 MIDI
channels (or choose All).
• MIDI volume: Clicking this icon brings up the MIDI fader with which
you can adjust the velocity traveling through the MIDI port.
• MIDI Velocity meter: This tiny meter shows you a visual representa-
tion of the velocity of the MIDI in the track.
• MIDI Mute button: This mutes the MIDI data from triggering your
device.
• MIDI Pan slider: This pans your MIDI data left or right.
✦Inserts: These function just like inserts for audio tracks except you can
also choose an instrument from the drop-down menu to create the
sound if you want to use a software synthesizer. (See Book I, Chapter 4
for more on software synthesizers.)
✦Sends: Just like with audio tracks, you assign sends to the sounds
coming from the track.
✦Input: The Input button functions the same as an audio track where you
select the hardware inputs for this track. This allows you to have a MIDI
device connected through the Instruments section tools at the top of the
channel strip while also having the audio outputs of the device, such as
a synthesizer, input into this track.
✦Output: Use the Output button to choose the physical audio output to
which you want to assign the track: the same as with an audio track.
✦Patch select: This button (located below the channel fader) lets you
change the sound that comes out of your MIDI hardware (connected via
the Instrument section listed above) when a note is played. Clicking this
button opens the MIDI Patch Select dialog box, in which you enter the
program number or name of the sound to want the track to play. This
allows you to change sounds throughout the session.
✦Track type: This instrument track icon looks like five notes of a music
keyboard.

Managing the Mix Window
204
Auxiliary input track
An auxiliary input track is a track that you can use for grouped audio — or
for MIDI tracks, effects sends, submixes, alternative mixes, monitor mixes,
and so on. Auxiliary tracks are similar to audio tracks and have the same
functions except that you don’t have a Record Enable button because these
tracks don’t actually contain any audio. Instead, they are used only for rout-
ing other tracks through them. The Track Type icon is a blue down arrow.
Figure 4-32 shows a typical auxiliary track’s channel strip.
Master Fader track
The Master Fader track lets you control where your other tracks are sent.
This track’s channel strip is much simpler than the others; all it really does
is add the other tracks. The features include just the outputs, automation
modes, fader and velocity display, and the Groups button.

from mono tracks: They have two panning sliders and two velocity displays
showing. Figure 4-34 shows a stereo track.

Stereo audio tracks take up two voices in your system. (As you can read in
Book III, Chapter 1, any audio track that’s active takes up a voice.) Because
you can have a total of only 32 voices playing in any one session at one 
time, you need to choose your stereo tracks wisely.
Expanding the channel strips view
You can add three additional views to your channel strips by choosing
View➪Mix Window from the main menu and then choosing Comments,
Inserts, and/or Sends. Figure 4-35 shows you what you can expect to see, and
the next few sections tell you the particulars for each view.
Comments view
With this option, you can add comments to each track by just click the
Comments box and type in your comments. This can be helpful for keeping
track of info, such as microphones used, edits performed, or anything that
can keep you organized while mixing.
Inserts view
The Inserts view section of the channel strip displays any inserted DSPs
(Digital Signal Processors) that you have for each track — usually effects
such as compression or delay. Click the arrows in the window to open a
drop-down menu where you can choose from the plug-ins in your system.
Figure 4-36 shows a typical list of these inserts. (Book VI, Chapters 4 and 5
have more on inserted effects.)

send your track’s signal to. Clicking the arrows opens a pop-up menu (as
shown in Figure 4-37) where you choose the bus or interface output to send
your track’s signal. (If you use outboard effects, see Book VI, Chapter 5 for
more details.)
Looking at lists: The Mix Window variant
Plenty of lists appear in the “Examining the Edit Window” section (earlier in
this chapter), but Pro Tools list-making capabilities crop up in the Mix
window as well. Aside from containing all the channel strips for your project,
the Mix window can also be set to list all the tracks in your session — as well
list any groups you created with those tracks. These lists show up on the left
side of the Mix window, as shown in Figure 4-38.
Show/Hide Tracks list
Going from top to bottom, the first list to the left of the Mix window is the
Show/Hide Tracks list. Each track of your session is listed in this list. With this
list, you can show or hide each track by simply selecting or deselecting it in
the list window. When you hide a selected track, the channel strip disappears
from the Mix window. This makes it easy to work with individual tracks or
groups of tracks by keeping your Mix window uncluttered. To show a hidden
track, click that track’s name in the Tracks list and watch it reappear.

Groups list
The Groups list lets you create and manage grouped tracks — tracks that
you assigned together so that you can edit them together. To create groups
of tracks, hold down the Shift key down and then click the names of the tracks
in each channel strip to highlight them. After they’re highlighted, click and
hold the Edit Groups title. When a drop-down menu appears, choose New
Group; when a dialog box appears, enter a name for your new grouped track.
After you create a few groups, you can show or hide them in any combination
that you want.

Working with Window Configurations
210
Working with Window Configurations
A window configuration is a saved setup of the various Pro Tools windows in
the size order and arrangement you choose. You can have a window configu-
ration for when you record new tracks, when you edit, when you mix, and when
you master. In fact, in Pro Tools, you can create and save up to 99 different
window configuration variations. This is handy for speeding up your work
because you simply choose a configuration that you want instead of having to
open and close windows or resize them while you work.
As a long-time Logic user, this is one feature that I always missed when I
worked in Pro Tools. Now that Pro Tools has added window configuration, I
can move from window setup to window setup like I used to in that other
program. This makes me happy, and I’m sure that after you get a few window
configuration setups in your sessions, you’ll be happy (and more produc-
tive), too. The following sections help you do this.
Creating window configurations
Creating a window configuration is easy. Here are the steps:
1. Arrange the various windows in your session how you’d like to have
them saved.
This can include the Edit, Mix, Transport, plug-in, and any other window
that Pro Tools lets you open and move around in your session.
2. Choose Window➪Configurations➪New Configuration.
The New Window Configuration dialog box opens, as shown in Figure
4-39. Choose the options you want within this dialog box. (See the
following bulleted list for details about all the options in this dialog box.)
3. Click OK or press Return/Enter.
The New Window Configuration dialog box closes, and your settings are
saved.
From the New Window Configuration dialog box, choose which properties of
the windows you arranged in your session to save. These include the following:
✦Number: This is the number of your window configuration. By default,
the next available number is entered into this box, but you can put any
number that you like between 1 and 99.
✦Name: This is the name of your window configuration. Enter a descrip-
tive name. I usually enter a name that represents the purpose of the con-
figuration, such as Audio editing or Tracking.

Recalling window configurations
After you have window configurations saved, you can recall them easily. My
favorite way is to use keyboard shortcuts. Here’s how:
1. Press period (.) on the numeric keypad section of your keyboard.
2. Type the number of the window configuration you want to open.
3. Press the asterisk (*) in the numeric keypad section of your keyboard.
Your desired window configuration opens.
You can also select a saved window configuration by choosing Window➪
Configurations➪configuration name.
Managing window configurations
You can easily manage your window configurations from the Window
Configurations List window. You open the Window Configuration List window
by choosing Window➪Configurations➪Window Configuration List. You can
also open this window by pressing Ô+Option+J (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+J (PC).
The window shown in Figure 4-40 opens.

when you create a new window configuration. You can also change the
name by double-clicking it to open the Edit Window Configuration dialog
box (more on this in the next section, “Editing window configurations”).
✦View filter icons: Use these icons to filter the window configurations
that you see in the list. The icons also help you see at a glance what win-
dows are included in each configuration in the list. These icons are
• Window Layout: This icon appears in your window configuration
when you choose to save the location and size of all the open win-
dows in your configuration.
• Edit Window Settings: This icon lets you know that the Edit windows
are stored in your configuration.
• Mix Window Settings: This icon tells you that the Mix windows are
stored in your configuration.
• Transport Window Settings: This icon lets you know that the
Transport windows are stored in your configuration
You select these icons when you create or edit your window configu-
rations. I detail this process in the next section.
✦Comments: You can enter comments in this section to remind you of
what is in the window configuration.
Window Configurations drop-down menu
You can easily manage your window configurations from the drop-down

Updating window configurations
Many times, while I’m working, I find a better way to have my window config-
uration, so I want to update it. You can do this manually or automatically:
✦Manually: Make any changes to arrangement of your windows and then
choose Window➪Configurations➪Update Active Configuration.
✦Automatically: Choose Window➪Configurations➪Auto-Update Active
Configuration. Now, whenever you make a change, your active configura-
tion is saved.
Deleting window configurations
Here’s how to delete a window configuration:
1. Open the Window Configuration List window by choosing Window➪
Configurations➪Window Configuration List.
2. Select the configuration you want to delete by clicking it.

Working with Window Configurations
216
3. Choose Delete “Name” from the Window Configuration List 
drop-down menu.
Your configuration is deleted, and your remaining configurations are
renumbered to fill the space occupied by the configuration you just
deleted.
If you want to keep the slot occupied by the window configuration after you
delete, simply choose Clear “Name” instead of Delete “Name” from the Window
Configuration List drop-down menu. This is handy when you want to put a
new window configuration in its place.

Chapter 5: Importing 
and Exporting Files
In This Chapter
 Importing and exporting audio files
 Importing and exporting MIDI files
 Importing and exporting session data
O
ne of the most powerful aspects of Pro Tools is that it can import a
variety of file types and formats into a session and then export them
just as easily. You can record tracks in another session (or even another
software program) and be able to edit, mix, and process them in Pro Tools.
For example, you can import and export audio files, MIDI files, and session
tracks in formats from AIFF and BWF to Standard MIDI files (SMF) — and
even import raw session data, the tracks, plug-in settings, and other session
details. (Chapter 3 of this mini-book has more on Pro Tools sessions.) This
chapter covers all these options. And if you have some files that use bit
depths and sample rates different from the session you’re working on, I
show you how to import them, too.
Importing into a Session
If you want to fancy up your Pro Tools session, you can import audio and
other data not only from other Pro Tools sessions but also from other
recording programs, such as Logic. So prepare to get fancy.
Importing audio files
Before Pro Tools can import an audio file into your session, it has to find the
file on your hard drive. Then you can add the file directly, copy it first and
then plunk it down in your session, or convert it to a different format before
you import it. The following sections take a look at the types of files you can
import, as well as the steps that make it all possible.
Figuring out file types
You can import the following audio files types into a Pro Tools session:

Importing into a Session
218
✦SDII (Sound Designer II): This was the native format for Pro Tools ses-
sions on Macs. However, this format isn’t used much anymore, and you
can’t exchange this type of file with PCs unless you first convert the file
into a different format, such as BWF or AIFF.
✦BWF (Broadcast WAV File): This file type is the standard for older, 
PC-based Pro Tools systems. Currently, it’s the most commonly used file
type; for that matter, I normally work with it. BWFs are compatible with
both Macs and PCs.
✦AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format): This file format used to be native
to Macs. You don’t have to convert AIFF files to any other format before
importing them into a Pro Tools session, even if it’s on a PC.
✦MPEG-1 Layer 3: This type — yep, it’s the famous MP3 — is a great
format for putting music on the Internet (say, a demo track for your
band), as you’ll find out when you check out Book VIII, Chapter 2. If you
choose this option, you have several parameters to choose from when
encoding your music so that you can get the best combination of size
and sound quality.
MP3 is an option for Pro Tools: You have to buy the full-feature version
of this capability if you want to use it any longer than its 30-day, free trial
period. After your trial period is up, you can buy the authorization code
to keep using this option from Digidesign for $20. You can find it by
going to the main Digidesign page (www.digidesign.com). From there,
hover over the Products menu and click All Products Index. Scroll down
a bit and click the Compatible Software link. On the page that appears,
you can find MP3 options in the list of software.
✦RealAudio G2: This file format is used for streaming audio files received
over the Internet, using the RealAudio player. You can use this file
format on all PCs and on Macs running OS 9, but not on Macs that run
OS X.
RealAudio G2 uses compression to reduce the size of the music file.
However, but when you downsize the file, you also lose some sound
quality, so it’s not recommended for your final mix.
✦QuickTime: Pro Tools offers no built-in support for it (even though it
shows up here). The QuickTime format is useful if you want to send
the file via e-mail. You play QuickTime files using the Apple QuickTime
player — a nice bit of software supported by many multimedia
applications — but you have to purchase and install that program
separately.
✦Sound Resource: The only time to use this Mac-only format (in my 
opinion) is if you want to play the music in an application that doesn’t
support SDII or AIFF formats. If you end up with a file in this format, you
can convert it easily via the Import Audio to Track command.

219
✦Windows Media: This is a Windows-only format. Like with other unsup-
ported file formats, you can convert these files into something useable
by accessing the Import Audio dialog box: Choose File➪Import Audio 
to Track.
Importing audio
In the preceding section, I outline the different types of files Pro Tools can
handle. In this section, I show how you can import those audio files into Pro
Tools. The two most common ways of doing this are
✦From the keyboard: Press Shift+Ô+I (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+I (PC). This gets
you to the selfsame Import Audio dialog box.
✦From the File menu: Choose File➪Import Audio to Track to access the
Import Audio dialog box, where you can place the audio directly into a
track in your session.
Whichever of these methods you choose, you end up with the Import Audio
dialog box, where you choose the file you want to import. See Figure 5-1.
The easiest way on a Mac to find the files you want to import is from the
browser section, located under the From drop-down menu (located below
the Enable drop down menu in the upper section of the window). You can
use the scroll bar at the bottom to find the hard drive you want by moving it
all the way to the left. From there, progress to the right by choosing the fold-
ers you want as you go until you get to the actual file you want to import.
You can limit the types of files that show up in the file browser by choosing
to display only certain file types (WAV, for example) by selecting this file
type in the Show drop-down menu.
To keep the Import process rolling along, follow these steps after the Import
Audio dialog box opens:
1. From the file browser section of the Import Audio dialog box, click
the file you want to import.
The properties of the selected file appear in the lower half of the 
dialog box.
Depending on the properties of the file you select — and the settings in
your session — you have three options:
• Add: If the audio files are the same file type and bit depth as your 
session, you can add the files directly into your session. When you
do so, you’re telling Pro Tools to use the original file — not a copy —
from its current place on your hard drive.

Importing into a Session
220
If you do this, make sure that you don’t alter this original file if it’s
also part of another session. Otherwise, it will be changed in that
session, too.
If you have to add files of different file types into your session, you
can — SDII, AIFF, or WAV on a Mac; or, AIFF or WAV on a PC — but
doing so slows down system performance.
• Copy: If your file is of the same type and bit depth as your session,
you can make a copy of the file to put into your session. Doing this
allows you to place the copy directly in the folder with the other files
in your session. If you destructively alter the copy, you won’t be
altering how the original file plays in any other session.

The only drawback to choosing Copy when importing an audio file is
that you’re adding more stuff that takes up space on your hard drive
(not a big deal these days, given the low cost of huge hard drives).
• Convert: If the file you choose to import is of a different file type, bit
depth, or sample rate as your session, you need to convert it first
before importing it into your session.
When you choose to convert a file, you also choose the quality of the
conversion process. You set the conversion quality of your converted
files from the Processing tab of the Preferences window, as shown in
Figure 5-2. Access this by choosing Setup➪Preferences. The drop-
down menu that controls conversion quality is located on the right
and under the Import section of the Processing tab the Preferences
dialog box. Options range from TweakHead (highest quality/slowest
conversion) to Low (lowest quality/fastest conversion).
2. Audition the selected file before importing it by clicking the Play and
Stop buttons in the lower section of the Import Audio dialog box.
The vertical slider adjusts the volume of your audition; the horizontal
slider adjusts your location in the auditioned file.
3. Click the Add, Copy, or Convert button to place the file in the Regions
to Import list.

You can select more than one file by Shift-clicking to highlight the files
you want to include in the list. You can also click the Add All or Convert
All button to include all the files in the current directory on the Regions
to Import list.
4. Click Done.
The Audio Import Options dialog box opens.
5. Select the destination of the audio track(s). Your options are
New Track: The New Track option creates a new track in your session for
each of the audio files you select. If you choose this option, you must
select (from the drop-down menu) where you want the audio file to go in
the new track. Your options are:
• Session Start: This places your imported audio at the beginning of
your session.
• Song Start: This places your imported audio at the Song Start Marker
in your session. You can open the move Song Start window by 
choosing Event➪Time➪Move Song Start.
• Selection: Your audio will be placed in the specific location where
your cursor is within your session.
• Spot: Choosing this option opens the Spot dialog box, where you
want type where you want the audio to start.
Regions List: The Regions List option simply puts your files in the
Regions list on the right side of the Edit window where you can drag
them into a track when you’re ready to include them in your song.
6. Click OK.
Your audio file(s) are imported into your session. This might take a
minute if your audio file(s) need to be converted.
Importing MIDI files
MIDI data contains all the performance information for your MIDI instru-
ments, but it doesn’t contain any actual sound. You need a sound source for
that. Pro Tools lets you bring that data into a session where you can work
with and add the sounds you want. This data is in the form of a Standard
MIDI File. Standard MIDI files consist of data stored in a common format that
can be read by nearly all MIDI devices. When you import a Standard MIDI file
into Pro Tools, you get two choices:
✦Import the file directly into a track.
✦Import it into your session’s MIDI Regions list.

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Importing into a Session
223
The following sections detail the types of MIDI files supported by Pro Tools
and how to import them.
Figuring out file types
Pro Tools allows you to import the following two types of Standard MIDI files:
✦Type 0: Type 0 Standard MIDI files contain all MIDI data on one track.
When you import this type of file into a session, Pro Tools sorts data
appropriate for each stereo channel and places the data in separate
regions and tracks.
✦Type 1: Type 1 MIDI files contain multiple tracks of MIDI data. When you
import this type of file into Pro Tools, each track’s data goes to a sepa-
rate MIDI track or region in Pro Tools.
Importing MIDI
You can import standard MIDI files into a Pro tools session one of two ways:
✦From the File menu: Choose File➪Import➪MIDI to access the Choose a
MIDI File navigation box (as shown in Figure 5-3).
✦From the keyboard: Press Option+Ô+I (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+I (PC).
Whichever of these methods you choose, you end up at the Choose a MIDI
File navigation box, where you choose the file you want to import.
Figure 5-3:
Select MIDI
files to
import into a

Importing into a Session
224
The easiest way to find the files you want to import is from the browser 
section, located under the From drop-down menu located just beneath the
Enable drop-down menu. To navigate this browser section, move the scroll
bar at the bottom of the section all the way to the left to find the hard drive
that contains your MIDI files. Click it to select it, and then click the folders
you want from the boxes on the right until you get to the file you want to
import.
Select the file using the browser and click Open. The MIDI Import Options
dialog box opens (refer to Figure 5-3), where you can choose to place the
MIDI file in a new track in your session or in the Regions list, where you can
place it in a track later on.
If you want to import your MIDI file into the Regions list, select the Regions
List option in the Destination section and then click OK.
If you choose to import your MIDI file into a new track, you have some more
decisions to make:
✦Location: You can choose among three options from this drop-down
menu:
• Session Start: Beginning of the session
• Selection: Where your cursor is currently located
• Spot: If you choose Spot, the Spot dialog box opens when you click
OK to allow you to choose the exact spot in your session you want to
MIDI file to begin.
✦Import Tempo Map from MIDI File: If you want the tempo of the
imported MIDI file to override the tempo of your present session, select
this check box.
✦Import Key Signature from MIDI File: As you can probably guess,
selecting this check box imports the MIDI file’s current key signature
data to travel along with the MIDI performance data. Select this check
box if you want this information in your session.
✦Remove Existing instrument Tracks: Select this check box to choose to
keep or discard any existing Instrument tracks or regions in your session.
If you already have instrument tracks that you want to use in the session,
be sure to choose to keep them; if not, go ahead and discard them.
✦Remove Existing MIDI Tracks: Select this check box to choose to keep
or discard any existing MIDI tracks or regions in your session. If you
already have MIDI tracks that you want to use in the session, be sure to
choose to keep them; if not, go ahead and discard them.
✦Remove Existing MIDI Regions: Select this check box to choose to keep
or discard any existing MIDI regions that you have in your session.

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Importing into a Session
225
Your successfully imported MIDI file is placed in your session one of two
ways:
✦If you imported by using the New Track option: Your file is placed in 
a newly created MIDI track in your session. If this is the case, select the
MIDI channel and instrument you want to specify for your MIDI track’s
output so that you can hear the performances when you play your 
session, as described in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.
✦If you imported by using the MIDI Regions option: Your MIDI data is
placed in the MIDI Regions list. Click and drag the files from the MIDI
Regions list into an existing track to put them in your session.
Importing tracks
The Pro Tools Import Bag of Tricks isn’t limited to just audio and MIDI files.
In fact, you can import entire tracks from another session into your current
session just by using the Import Tracks command. Choose File➪Import
Session Data to call up the Import Session Data dialog box, and you’re well
on your way to getting that great track from last month’s session embedded
in your present project.
Understanding the Import Session Data dialog box
The Import Session Data dialog box is where you select the various proper-
ties of the tracks you want to import. If you’re bringing in a track from a pre-
vious session, this is where you choose what aspects of your original track
you want kept (say, keep the plug-in settings and lose the panning settings)
when it gets imported into your present session.
As you can see in Figure 5-4, the Import Session Data dialog box gives you
lots of properties to mull over. (“Do I import this? Don’t I import that? What
parts of this stuff do I or don’t I import?” Ack. . . .) These properties include
✦Source Properties: This includes the basics — session name, type, and
start time; bit depth; sample rate — of the selected source file.
✦Audio Media Options: From this drop-down menu, select how you copy
and consolidate the source’s audio files. Its options include
• Refer to Source Media (Where Possible): Use this option if you want to
avoid duplicating files — it refers to your original files whenever pos-
sible. The files are copied only if they don’t reside on supported
media (such as CD-ROM), or if they have a different sample rate or
bit depth from the session you import into. This saves some space
on your hard drives.

Importing into a Session
226
• Copy from Source Media: Choosing this option copies all the audio
files, automatically converting any files that have bit depths or
sample rates that differ from those of the target session. This uses up
space on your hard drive, but with today’s super-cheap drives, it’s
not as big a deal as it used to be (when drives were expensive).
• Consolidate from Source Media: This option copies and consolidates
the audio in regions used in the source session, eliminating any
unused audio from the parent files. When you choose this option,
you also get to choose the handle length (the extra time before and
after the region start and end times). This keeps you from importing
any unnecessary material if you’re sure that you won’t be using it in
your session.
• Force to Target Session Format: This option copies — and converts —
any files that don’t have the same bit depth and sample rate as the
target session; it points to (but doesn’t copy) any files that do match
these traits. Use this option if you don’t want any extra stuff taking
up room on your hard drives.

227
✦Video Media Options: The drop-down menu here gives you two options
when importing video data into a session: You can copy the stuff, or you
can refer to the source material. Which option you choose depends on
how much hard drive space you have and whether you think you need
more than one copy of the original file. If you have tons of space and
think you’ll be editing the data, by all means copy it. However, if you
know you won’t be making any changes, there’s no need to add to the
clutter of your hard drive.
✦Time Code Mapping Options: Every video file contains time code data
(information that lets you know where you are in the video). You can
choose from three ways to place imported material in the session:
• Maintain Absolute Time Code Values: This option puts your imported
tracks at the same time location as the source session. This is a good
choice if the session you import into uses the same start time as
your source session and you want the imported session tracks to
remain at the beginning of the session.
• Maintain Relative Time Code Values: This option places the imported
material at the same time from the start of the session as their
source session. This means that if you have tracks in a session that
start 30 seconds from the beginning of the session, they will remain
30 seconds from the start of the session into which they’re imported
regardless of the actual start time of both sessions.
• Map Start Time Code To: This option lets you choose a new start time
for your imported files. When you select this option, you also select
the start time for your imported file in the Time Value field. This
option is useful when you have a different start time on the session
data you want to import, and you want to place the imported data at
a specific point in the new session. This start point is entered into
the Handle Size field.
✦Track Offset Options: The options in this section allow you to place the
tracks relative to their original start times. For example, if you want to
import session data into a track and have it start four measures (bars)
after the session starts, you can select Bars:Beats from the drop-down
menu and enter 4 in the text field.
✦Sample Rate Conversion Options: If your source and target sessions
have different sample rates (you select the sample rate of a session
when you create it), you’re prompted to select whether sample rate 
conversion is applied and, if so, how it’s done. This area of the Import
Session Data dialog box lets you do that, using the following options:
• Apply SRC: Select this check box to apply sample rate conversion to
your imported session data. When you select this check box, you can
choose from the following options:
• Source Sample Rate: This option lets you choose the sample rate
from which your source files begin the sample rate process.

Importing into a Session
228
• Destination Sample Rate: This setting is always the same as that of
your current session.
• Conversion Quality: This drop-down menu lets you choose the sound
quality you get from the sample-rate conversion process. You have a
choice among Low (fastest), Good, Better, Best, and TweakHead
(slowest).
✦Source Tracks: This section of the Import Session Data dialog box
shows you all the source tracks in the session containing the tracks you
want to import. Each track has a drop-down menu that allows you to
either select it for import or not.
✦Import: This section enables you to determine whether to import
tempo/meter, key signature, and other configuration settings:
• Tempo/Meter Map: Select this check box to import tempo and meter
maps (specified tempo and meter events throughout the session)
from the source session. Select this option if your source session
contains tempo and meter information that you want to use in the
target session.
• Key Signature Map: You can import existing key signature data into
your session by selecting this check box.
• Markers/Memory Locations: Selecting this check box includes mark-
ers and memory locations with your imported session data.
• Window Configurations: You can import window configurations (size
and locations of open windows) into your session by selecting this
check box. You can find out more about window configurations in
Chapter 4 of this mini-book.
Importing tracks
After you have a chance to get comfortable with the Import Session Data
dialog box, you can get some practical experience by using the following
steps to import some actual tracks into a session:
1. Choose File➪New Session to create a new session or choose
File➪Open Session to open an existing one.
2. Choose File➪Import Session Data from the main menu.
A dialog box appears, prompting you to choose a file from which to
import session data.
3. Choose the Pro Tools file (.pts suffix) containing the track you want
to import, and then click Open.
The Import Session Data dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 5-4.)

Book II
Chapter 5

4. In the Import Session Data dialog box, go through the Source Tracks
list and click the name of each track you want to import.
To select multiple noncontiguous tracks, press and hold Ô (Mac) or Ctrl
(PC) while you click the track names. To select multiple contiguous
tracks, press and hold Shift while you click the names.
5. From the drop-down menus, choose your Audio Media, Video Media,
Time Code Mapping, and Track Offset options.
See the previous section, “Understanding the Import Session Data dialog
box,” for more on how to use these options.
6. (Session-dependent) If the sample rate of your new session is different
from the sample rate of the session you’re importing from, you need
to first convert it to the target session’s rate before you can import it.
Do this by selecting the sample rate of the source session from the
Source Sample Rate drop-down menu and then choosing an option
from the Conversion Quality drop-down menu.
You find these drop-down menus in the Sample Rate Conversion Options
section of the Import Session Data dialog box.
7. (Optional) If you want to import meter/tempo maps, key signature
maps, markers or memory locations, or window configurations from
the source session, select the appropriate check box(es) in the Import
section of the dialog box.
Importing these maps ensures that the target session has the same
maps, locations, and/or window configurations as the source session.
8. Click OK.
9. (Optional) If you chose to copy audio or video media — or consolidate
data from them — select a location to place the media files.
Exporting from a Session
Pro Tools lets you export audio, MIDI, and region data from one session to
another. This is handy if you want to take parts of a song and add them to
parts of another song, as in the case of an R&B remix of a pop tune. This 
section describes the process.
Exporting audio
Pro Tools gives you several ways to export audio — as regions, as stereo-
interleaved files, or as region definitions, depending on what you want to do
with it. Here’s a rundown on these options (and what the heck these terms
mean):

Exporting from a Session
230
✦Export Audio Regions as Files: This lets you take a region in your 
track and export it as its own audio file that you can then use in another
session. This is great for making separate audio files of drum loops: for
example, if you’re ready to place them in your mix.
✦Export as Stereo Interleaved Files: This lets you take the regions from 
a stereo track or two regions from two mono tracks and save them as a
single, stereo-interleaved file. (Stereo-interleaved files are the type that
many other programs create when doing a stereo mix.)
✦Export Region Definitions: This lets you export the information that
defines the region. Doing this keeps you from having to make a copy of
the audio (saves hard drive space) while still being able to use the
region in a new session. (Pro Tools uses the original audio file so that
you don’t have two in your system.)
Exporting regions
Because regions are only portions of the audio in an audio file, Pro Tools lets
you take this portion and make a separate file containing just this audio
data. Exporting regions allows you to take a lovingly crafted musical element
(a killer drum loop, for example) and use it in another session or application
without having to re-create it from the parent audio file.
To export a region as a new audio file, follow these steps:
1. Select the region(s) by one of two ways:
• From the Audio Regions list (located on the right side of the Edit
window): Select the region(s) you want to export by clicking the
region’s name. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
while you click each region’s name. (If the list isn’t visible, click the
double arrows at the bottom left of the Edit window to call it up.)
• From the Track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region to select it. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
while you make your selections.
2. Choose Export Regions as Files from the Audio Regions drop-down
menu (the menu you open by clicking and holding the Audio Regions
name at the top of the Audio Regions list).
The Export Selected dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-5.
3. Choose the export settings you want for your new file.
• File Type: Choose the file type of the session you want to use this file
in. If you’re not sure where you’re going to use the file, choose BWF
or AIFF. You can read about these file types earlier in this chapter.

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Exporting from a Session
231
• Format: Your choices here are (Multiple) Mono or Stereo. Choose the
format appropriate for your file. If your drum loop, for example, is in
stereo and has panning information, you’ll want to select Stereo.
• Bit Depth: You can choose from 8, 16, and 24 bits. I recommend
selecting the same bit depth as your current session.
• Sample Rate: You choices include 8, 11.025, 16, 22.050, 32, 44.1, 48,
88.2, 96, 177.4, and 192 kHz. Choose the sample rate of the session
you want to put this file into. If you’re not sure, select the same rate
as your current session.
4. Select a destination for the file in the Destination Directory field by
clicking the Choose button and following the prompt.
5. Select from the Resolve Duplicate File Names By options:
• Prompting for Each Duplicate: This stops the exporting process and
lets you know when Pro Tools finds a duplicate filename. You can
then choose to either replace the original or create a new name.
• Auto Renaming: You authorize Pro Tools to automatically create a
new name for these files. This is the best option to choose if you
don’t want to have to answer a prompt for each duplicate filename
and you want to make sure that your original files aren’t replaced.
• Replacing with New Files: This option replaces any existing files con-
taining the same name with your newly exported ones. This is the
option to take if you’re sure that you don’t ever want the original 
files bearing the same name.

6. Click Export.
Your new file is created and saved to the destination you chose in the
Destination Directory field of the Export Selected dialog box.
Exporting stereo-interleaved files
A stereo-interleaved file is a single audio file with all the stereo data con-
tained in them. These types of stereo files are different than the ones used 
in Pro Tools, which consist of two separate audio files for stereo. One con-
tains the left channel data, and the other contains the right channel data.
Although Pro Tools doesn’t support stereo interleaved file types, you can
export regions from within your session as a single, stereo interleaved file.
This is an important feature because many other audio applications — such
as mastering programs — use stereo-interleaved files instead of the separate
ones that Pro Tools favors.
To export a region as a stereo interleaved file, do the following:
1. Select either a stereo region or two mono regions one of two ways:
• From the Regions list (located on the right side of the Edit window):
Click the name of the region to highlight it. To select two mono
regions, hold the Shift key while you click each region’s name.
• From the track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region within the track to highlight it. For more than one mono
region, hold the Shift key while you click each region.
2. Choose Export Selected as Files from the Regions list drop-down 
menu — the menu you open by clicking and holding the Audio
Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list.
The Export Selected dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 5-5.)
3. Choose Interleaved from the Format drop-down menu.
4. Choose the rest of your settings for this file.
Check out the previous section, “Exporting regions,” for tips on what 
settings to choose here.
5. Click Export.
Your file is created and saved on your hard drive so you can use it in an
application that supports stereo interleaved files.
Exporting region definitions
Region definitions are the information that Pro Tools uses to define the 
location, start, and end times of a region within the parent audio file. If
you’ve come up with some Pro Tools regions that you want to use in another

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Exporting from a Session
233
session (or some other application that supports Pro Tools regions data),
you can export region definitions from your session without having to copy
the region as an audio file. In effect, all you save using this command are the
pointers that make up the region definition: The definition points to the
parent file and not the audio itself.
If you actually want to use a region definition in another session or applica-
tion, make sure that the region’s parent audio file still exists on the hard
drive. A definition that points to nothing is no help.
To export region definitions, follow these steps:
1. Select the regions you want to export the region definitions for:
• From the Audio Regions list (located in the right side of the Edit
window): Select the region(s) you want to export by clicking the
region’s name. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
while you click each region’s name. (If the list isn’t visible, click the
double arrows at the bottom left of the Edit window.)
• From the Track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region to select it. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
while you make your selections.
2. Choose Export Region Definitions from the Audio Regions list drop-
down menu — the menu you opened by clicking and holding the

3. Click Export.
The pointing data for the selected regions are exported.
Exporting MIDI
Ah, the miracle of MIDI — say you’ve laid down a kickin’ “keyboard” part on
guitar synth. How do you get it out of the current session? To export MIDI
data to another device or application, you need to save your MIDI tracks and
regions as a Standard MIDI file. You can save them as Type 0 files (a single
multichannel track) or as Type 1 files (multiple tracks).
To export MIDI tracks, follow these steps:
1. (Optional) Mute any MIDI tracks you don’t want to include in the
Export MIDI procedure by clicking the Mute button for these tracks.
Any muted tracks are excluded from the export function.
2. Choose File➪Export➪MIDI from the main menu.
The Export MIDI Settings dialog box appears, as shown on the top in
Figure 5-6.

3. From the MIDI File Format drop-down list, select the format of your
heart’s choosing:
• 0 (Single track)
• 1 (Multi-track)
You must also select the Apply Real-Time Properties check box as you
want.
4. Click OK.
The Save a MIDI File As dialog box appears, as shown in the bottom in
Figure 5-6.
5. Enter the name and location for this newly exported file in the Save
As text field, and select a destination for the file from the Where 
drop-down menu.
6. Click Save.
Your new MIDI file is created from all the unmuted MIDI tracks in your
session in the location you designated. This file includes all notes; con-
troller events; program changes; System Exclusive data (instructions
exclusive to the device); and tempo, meter, and marker events. Society
of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) time code start
time is also included so that your MIDI files will start at their proper
time when opened.
Managing Files
As soon as you start to record and edit your music, you start filling your
hard drive with data. Properly managing your data helps you keep your

system stable, lets you maximize your hard space, and protects you from 
the worst disaster of them all — lost data. This section details three impor-
tant file-management tasks — compacting files, deleting files, and backing up
data — you should routinely do to keep everything running smoothly.
Compacting files
Editing means cutting a snippet from here and taking the best chunk from
there and putting it altogether to make a (hopefully coherent) whole. It also
means that, after you extract that great 15-second bit from that 75-second
clip, you’re going to have a lot of stuff cluttering up the virtual cutting-room
floor of your hard drive. What to do?
You can get rid of the clutter — the unused portions of the audio files in
your session — by using the Audio Regions list Compact Selected command.
This command deletes any audio from a file in your session where there are
no regions referencing the data. It helps conserve disk space.
Postpone using the Compact Selected command until after you finish all the
editing in your session because it permanently deletes the unused audio
data from the session. Don’t use this command until you’re sure that you don’t
want to use any of your data leftovers.
Compacting your audio files consists of three basic steps:
1. Select any unused regions in the session.
2. Clear these unused regions.
Steps 1 and 2 (ahem) clear the way to your final step:
3. Compact the files by removing the data for those cleared regions from
the parent files.
To compact an audio file, do the following:
1. Choose Select Unused➪Regions from the Audio Regions list drop-
down menu (the menu you opened by clicking and holding the Audio
Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list).
Any regions not used in a track in the current session become high-
lighted in the Audio Regions list.
2. Choose Clear Selected from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu to
remove the unused regions.
The Clear Audio dialog box appears.

Managing Files
236
3. Click Remove.
This removes the unused regions from your session.
4. Select the region(s) you want to compact from the Audio Regions list
by clicking the region name.
To select more than one region, hold the Shift key while you click each
region’s name.
5. Choose Compact Selected from the Audio Regions list drop-down
menu (the menu you open by clicking and holding the Audio Regions
name at the top of the Audio Regions list).
The Compact dialog box appears. This box contains a warning about the
consequences of compacting a file (read the Warning icon earlier in this
section) as a reminder that this is an irreversible process.
6. (Optional) If you have crossfades in the selected region(s), enter the
amount of padding (in milliseconds) that you want to put around each
selected region.
See Book IV, Chapter 4 for more on crossfades.
Padding adds space before and after your regions to account for any
crossfades (see Book IV, Chapter 4). Choose a pad length equal to 
(at least) the longest crossfade length for your selected regions.
7. Click the Compact button, located at the bottom of the Compact Audio
dialog box.
Your file is compacted, and the session is saved.
Deleting unwanted files
Like with any creative process, you end up with (in addition to your knock-
out musical creation) leftover junk that just takes up space. You can delete
unwanted files in your session from your hard drive by using the Clear
Selected command located under the Audio Regions list drop-down menu
(opened by clicking and holding the Audio Regions name at the top of the
Audio Regions list). Less unused data on your hard drive means more space
for the good stuff.
To delete an audio file, do the following:
1. Select the audio files you want to delete from the Audio Regions list.
The audio files are listed in bold letters in the Audio Regions list.
2. From the Audio Regions list drop-down menu (opened by clicking and
holding the Audio Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list),
choose Clear Selected.

Book II
Chapter 5

237
The Clear Audio dialog box appears. You have the options of Remove
(which you use before compacting a file — see the previous section) and
Delete. This is the one you want for this procedure.
3. Click the Delete button in the Clear Audio dialog box.
Your file is permanently deleted from your hard drive.
The Clear Selected command is irreversible. After you click Delete, your 
data is gone forever. If you think you might want the data someday, choose
Remove from the Clear Audio dialog box. Your file is removed from the 
session but not from your hard drive.
Backing up data
There’s a saying in the computer world: If the data doesn’t exist in more 
than two places, it doesn’t exist. I know I said this elsewhere (Chapter 1 of 
this mini-book, to be precise), but I think it bears repeating. As someone who
lost an entire project’s worth of data because I “forgot” to back up my files, 
I strongly encourage you to make a habit of backing up your sessions.
Backing up your files to the same hard drive does you no good if your drive
shuts down (a common occurrence). Always back-up to a different hard drive
or to another medium, such as a DVD-R. (Check out the manual for your DVD
burner for steps on how to do this.) You can also pick up a copy of CD &
DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Mark Chambers (Wiley).
To back up your session files to another hard drive, do the following:
1. Create a new folder on a different hard drive than your session and
call it Back Ups.
2. Choose File➪Save Copy In from the main menu.
The Save dialog box appears.
3. Use the file browser section of the dialog box to select the folder you
created in Step 1 as the destination for your backup files.
4. Enter a name for your backup in the Save As field of the Save Session
Copy In dialog box.
Because this copy exists on a whole different hard drive, I can use the
same name as that of my original session — and if it’s an exact duplicate,
I do. This is important because if the original files are lost, all you have
to do is drag the backed-up files onto your audio drive and get to work.
Using a different name means you have to rename or import all your files
before you can use them.

Managing Files
238
5. Under the Items to Copy box, select All Audio files as well as any
other setting you want to save such as plug-in settings or movie/
video files.
6. Click Save.
The files you selected are backed up to the destination you specify in
Step 3.
You can also back up your files by clicking and dragging the folder contain-
ing your session and audio files from one hard drive to another on your com-
puter’s desktop.

efore you can do any recording in Pro Tools, you need to create and
configure some tracks — specific places to put the vocals, instrumental
parts, pterodactyl screeches, whatever. This involves setting up new tracks,
naming the tracks, and assigning inputs and outputs to your newly created
and named tracks.
But that’s not all. When working with tracks in Pro Tools, you also need to
know how to show and hide, activate and deactivate, solo, mute, and adjust
your view of them, among other things. This chapter takes the mystery out
of dealing with tracks and shows you how to work with them both efficiently
and effectively.
Understanding Tracks in Pro Tools
Pro Tools has five types of tracks (Audio, Auxiliary Input, Master Fader,
MIDI, and Instrument) as well as two track formats (mono and stereo). All
possible permutations and combinations of these various types and formats
are explained with subtlety and style in the following sections.
Track types
When you work with tracks in Pro Tools, you have to keep in mind that
you’re sure to end up dealing with five distinct flavors of tracks. They are
✦Audio tracks: An audio track contains audio files and can be mono 
or stereo.
✦Auxiliary Input tracks: These tracks are used as effects sends, for 
submixes, or for other routing purposes.
✦Master Fader tracks: This track type contains the summed output for all
the tracks routed to it. Master Fader tracks can be mono or stereo;
stereo is most common.

Setting Up Tracks
242
✦MIDI tracks: MIDI tracks contain MIDI data — instructions to MIDI
devices on how to create specific digital sounds. (For more on MIDI,
check out Book I, Chapter 5. For more on MIDI tracks, go to Book V.) 
✦Instrument tracks: Instrument tracks are blends of Audio and MIDI tracks
that allow you to insert virtual instruments (such as software synthesiz-
ers) into your session. You can also route real instruments with their
corresponding audio outputs into the same track. These tracks contain
MIDI data while also allowing you some audio capabilities to make it
easy to use both software and hardware instruments. Book V, Chapter 1
offers more about these hybrid tracks.
Track formats
Pro Tools offers a bit less variety when it comes to track formats. You get
two — count ’em, two — choices:
✦Mono: A mono (monaural) track consists of a single channel of audio or
MIDI data. It uses, as its name implies, just one voice.
✦Stereo: A stereo (stereophonic) track consists of two channels of audio
and uses two voices. A MIDI track can’t be stereo.
Setting Up Tracks
Setting up your recording project is a little like setting up a railroad: It’ll take
you somewhere only if you first put the tracks in place. Getting that done is
what this section is about.
Creating new tracks
To create a new track, choose Track➪New from the main menu or press
Ô+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (PC). Either method opens the New Tracks
dialog box (as shown in Figure 1-1), where you get to choose the following:
✦Number of new tracks: The default here is 1, but you can pretty much
create up to 128 mono audio tracks or Auxiliary Input tracks, 64 Master
Fader tracks, 32 Instrument tracks, and 256 MIDI tracks. Just keep in
mind that you can have only 32 voices of audio tracks playing at one
time in your session.
✦Track format: Here you choose stereo or mono.
✦Track type: Clicking the arrows opens a drop-down menu that lets you
choose between an Audio, an Auxiliary Input, a Master Fader, a MIDI, or
an Instrument track.
✦Samples or ticks: You can choose between samples or ticks (bars/beats)
for your new tracks.

Setting Up Tracks
243
✦Plus sign: Clicking this adds another tracks selection row containing all
the options listed in this section so that you can add more than one type
of track without having to open the New Track window repeatedly.
Make your selections and then click Create to create your new track. 
This track then appears in the Edit and Mix windows and in the Show/Hide
list located on the right side of the Edit window. If the Show/Hide list isn’t
visible, click the double arrow at the lower-left corner of the Edit window.
Duplicating tracks
You can duplicate tracks — creating a new track that mirrors all the input,
output, effects send settings, and insert settings of your original track — in
two easy steps:
1. Click the name of the track in the Mix or the Edit windows.
To select more than one track to duplicate, hold the Shift key while you
click each track’s name.
The name is highlighted.
2. Choose Track➪Duplicate from the main menu.
The new track appears in the Mix and the Edit windows to the right of
the track you’re duplicating and just below the duplicated track in the
Show/Hide list.
Naming tracks
When you open a new track (choose Track➪New), Pro Tools creates a
default name for the track — something really helpful, like Audio 1 — 
but you can change the name to anything you want. You do this by double-
clicking the name of the track in either the Mix or the Edit windows. A dialog
box similar to what you see in Figure 1-2 opens, from which you can use the
fields to both change the name of the track as well as add any comments 
you want to include about the track. After you enter your track name and
comments, click OK — you’re set!
Figure 1-1:

I highly recommend that you name your new tracks right away with a name
that is descriptive of what you plan on recording on it. Some examples
include Vox (or Vocals), Ld Gtr, Snare, Kick, and so on. This will save you con-
fusion later on when you start to mix.
Assigning inputs and outputs
To record with your new track, you need to assign an input to it so Pro Tools
knows where your source sound is coming from. To hear the track play, 
you need to choose an output so Pro Tools can send the sound out to your
monitors or to your headphone jack.
That makes sense, right? Now, to actually assign an input to your track, do
the following:
1. Choose View➪Edit Window➪I/O from the main menu to open the I/O
section of the Edit window.
The I/O section shows the inputs and outputs for each track.
2. Within the I/O section of your track in the Edit window, click and hold
the Input selector (see Figure 1-3) until the Input contextual menu
pops up.

3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want.
4. Release the mouse button to select your choice from the Input contex-
tual menu.
This menu closes, and the input you select appears in the Input selector.
Choosing your outputs requires pretty much the same procedure, although
now you start things off by clicking the Output selector instead.
If you have an output you want to use for your session, such as Analog 1-2,
you can set this as the default in the I/O Setup dialog box. To do this, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪I/O to open the I/O Setup dialog box.
2. Click the Output tab.
3. Choose your output from the New Track Default Output drop-down
menu.
4. Click OK.
The window closes, and all your new tracks automatically receive your
chosen output upon creation.
Altering Your View of Tracks
Pro Tools gives you lots of options to change how tracks look in the Mix and
the Edit windows. You can change a track’s color, size, location, and even
whether you can see it. The following sections get you up to speed on these
options.
Showing and hiding tracks
Both the Edit and the Mix windows have the option of including an audio
tracks list in the window view (see Figure 1-4). In this list, the Tracks list, you
can show or hide selected tracks or groups of tracks. This list is located on
the left side of either window. If it’s not visible, click the double arrows at the
bottom left of either window to open it in that window.
Figure 1-4:
Use the list

You can show and hide tracks in two ways:
✦Use the drop-down menu. Click and hold the title bar of the Show/Hide
Tracks list until a menu opens up, as shown in Figure 1-5. Then just
choose the option you want.
The Show Only Selected Tracks option and the Hide Selected Tracks
option require that you first highlight your desired tracks in the main
part of the Edit or the Mix windows. To select one track, just click the
track’s name. To select more than one track, hold down the Shift key
while clicking each track you want. When you then use the Show Only
Selected option, for example, all non-highlighted tracks are hidden.
✦Click the track name in the Show/Hide Tracks list. Clicking directly 
on the track name located in the Show/Hide Tracks list toggles between
hiding and showing the track. You can even move a track around by
clicking and dragging it to where you want it in relation to the others.
If the Show/Hide Tracks list isn’t showing, click the double arrow at the
bottom-left corner of the window to open it (see Figure 1-6).
Click here to show the
Show/Hide Tracks list.

You can also use the Show/Hide Tracks list drop-down menu to sort tracks
by name, type, edit group, mix group, or voice, as shown in Figure 1-7. This
menu is opened by clicking and holding the Show/Hide Tracks list title.
Assigning track color
To make all your tracks easier to keep track of when you’re working, you can
assign color groups to the waveform display for each track in the Edit
window. To do this, choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu and
then click the Display tab in the Preferences dialog box. This opens the
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-8.

On the right side of this dialog box is the Default Track Color Coding section.
Here, you can choose from several radio buttons:
✦None: Makes the display for all the tracks the same color
✦Tracks and MIDI channels: Assigns colors to each waveform display
based upon the audio track number and the MIDI channels assigned for
each MIDI track
✦Tracks and MIDI Devices: Bases colors for the waveform display on the
audio track number and the MIDI device used
✦Groups: Colors the waveform display for your tracks according to a
track’s group membership
✦Track Type: Assigns colors according to the type of track in your session
Changing track size
You can alter the viewed size of tracks in the Edit or the Mix windows. This
can be a godsend, for example, when you have a ton of tracks in a session,
and you want to see them all onscreen (pick a small size) or if you have a
track that you want to edit (choose a giant-sized one). Here are your options:
✦Edit window: The Edit window allows you to choose from several differ-
ent-size track views. Your options include Micro, Mini, Small, Medium,
Large, Jumbo, Extreme, Fit to Window, and Expanded Track Display. You
access these options by clicking the track height selector or the ruler
bar at the far left side of the waveform display of the track, as shown in
Figure 1-9.
If you’re using Pro Tools version 7.3 and newer, you can simply drag
your track larger or smaller by clicking and dragging your mouse up or
down at the bottom of your track.
✦Mix window: In the Mix window, you can toggle between Narrow 
and Regular channel strip views by choosing View➪Narrow Mix Window
or View➪Regular Mix Window, respectively, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Pressing Option+Ô+M (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+M (PC) also toggles between
the two views.

Moving tracks around
You can move tracks around and arrange them in your Mix or Edit window
as you want them. This feature is handy if you have a group of tracks that
you want to have next to each other, such as percussion and drums. I place
any submixed tracks together to help me keep track (sorry, I couldn’t help
myself) of them all without having to move all over the Edit or Mix windows.
The following steps show you how to do this:
1. Locate the name of the track you’d like to move in the Tracks list, as
shown in Figure 1-11.
2. Click the track name and then drag the track up or down to where
you want it.
3. Release the mouse button.
The track stays put where you dragged it.
Moving the track around in one window changes its location in the other.
Deleting tracks
To delete a track, follow these steps:
1. Select the track by clicking its name in either the Edit or the Mix 
windows.

2. Choose Track➪Delete from the main menu.
3. Click OK.
Grouping Tracks
In Pro Tools, creating and managing groups of tracks is a snap. I strongly rec-
ommend taking advantage of Pro Tools grouping features because they let
you perform lots of different tasks — edits, for example — on more than one
track at a time.
Keeping track of grouped track parameters
When tracks are grouped, certain parameters become linked. These include
✦Automation modes
✦Editing functions
✦Mutes
✦Send mutes
✦Send levels
✦Solos
✦Track view
✦Track height
✦Volume levels
That’s a lot of parameters, but don’t let this long list fool you into thinking
that grouping links everything associated with your tracks. Some parameters
are not linked when you use the grouping feature, including
✦Creating plug-in instances
✦Output assignments
✦Panning
✦Record enables
✦Send panning
✦Voice assignments
Having these parameters independent when tracks are grouped is nice
because many times, these parameters vary from track to track. For exam-
ple, you don’t want the same plug-ins on all your drum tracks or the same
panning setting on all backup vocal tracks. (Both of these are great candi-
dates for grouping.)

Grouping Tracks
251
Creating groups
You can create groups by following these steps:
1. In either the Edit window or the Mix window, Shift-click the tracks
you want in your group.
Which window you use as your starting point doesn’t matter. Whatever
groups are created in one window automatically get created in the other
window.
2. Choose Track➪Group from the main menu, or New Group from the
Group drop-down menu (the menu you open by clicking and holding
the Group title in the Groups list section of the Edit or the Mix
window).
The Create Group dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-12.
3. Enter a name for your group in the Name field.
4. Use the radio buttons in the Type section to choose which window(s)
will show your new group.
Your choices here are
• Edit: When you want the group listed just in the Edit window
• Mix: When you want the group listed just in the Mix window
• Edit and Mix: When you want your group listed in both windows
Figure 1-12:

5. Choose a group ID from the ID drop-down menu.
The group ID is a single letter that defines your group. This lets you see
which group a track is in at a glance. (The group ID for a track is located
beneath the track’s level meters in the mix window.)
6. Click OK.
The Create Group dialog box closes, and your new group appears in the
Edit, the Mix, or both the Edit and the Mix windows (depending on your
choice in Step 4).
If a track in a group is hidden in the Show/Hide Tracks list, that track won’t
be affected by edits done to that group. All mix operations — with the
notable exception of Record Enable — do apply to hidden tracks, though.
Enabling groups
Before you can work with grouped tracks, you need to enable the group,
which you do by clicking the group name in the Groups list. (You’ll find the
Edit Groups list in the lower-left side of the Edit window; the Mix Groups 
list is in the lower-left side of the Mix window. If they aren’t visible, click 
the double arrow at the bottom-left corner of the Mix or the Edit window,
respectively.) Highlighting in blue means the group is enabled. Click the
group again to disable it. The blue highlight will disappear.
You can also enable and disable groups using a keystroke on your keyboard
in the Mix window by simply pressing the key for the group ID. To do 
the same thing in the Edit window, you need to first make sure that the
Commands Focus (A-Z) button to the right of the Edit Groups name is high-
lighted, as shown in Figure 1-13. (How will you know that it’s highlighted?
That’s easy. In its highlighted state, a blue border surrounds the box.)
Editing groups
After you set up some groups, you don’t have to treat them as if they were
set in stone. You can add — or subtract — members to the group, you can
change the group name, or you can just delete the group altogether. These
options are covered in the following sections.

Renaming a group
Follow these steps to rename a group:
1. Double-click the area to the left of the group name in the Groups list.
The Modify Groups dialog box appears.
The Edit Groups list is located in the lower-left side of the Edit window;
the Mix Groups list is in the lower-left side of the Mix window. If they
aren’t visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-left corner of the Mix
or the Edit window, respectively.
2. Type in your new name in the Name field.
3. Click OK.
Your group gets a spanking new name.
Adding a track to a group
You can add a track to an existing group by doing the following:
1. Double-click the area to the left of the group name in the Groups list.
The Modify Groups dialog box appears.
2. Select tracks from the Available window.
3. Click the Add button.
The selected tracks instantly appear in the Currently in Group window.
4. Click OK.
The selected tracks are added to the group selected in Step 1.
Deleting groups
You can delete unwanted groups by doing the following:
1. Click the name of the group in the Groups list.
Again, you find the Edit Groups list in the lower left of the Edit window,
and the Mix Groups list in the lower left of the Mix window. If they aren’t
visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-left corner of the Mix or
Edit the window, respectively.
2. Click the Groups drop-down menu (opened by clicking and holding
the Group title in the Groups list section of the Edit or Mix window)
and choose Delete Active Group.
You’ll be asked whether you’re sure you want to do this because after
you do, there’s no changing your mind. Proceed if you’re sure you don’t
ever want to use that group again.
Your group is history.

Linking edit and mix groups
When you create a new group, you have the option of making that group an
Edit group, a Mix group, or a combination Edit/Mix group. Regardless of
which option you choose, by default, functions done in either the Edit or the
Mix windows will affect groups in both. For example, if you have a drum
group in your Mix window consisting of kick, snare, toms, and overheads,
and you want to edit a bad note out of the snare drum in the Edit window,
you end up editing not only the snare drum note but also the audio from the
other members of the drum group you assigned in the Mix window.
This might be what you want most of the time, but maybe you don’t want
the default — where Edit or Mix functions affect entire groups. The way to
get around this is to disable the Link Edit and Mix Groups option in the
Preferences dialog box. Do so by following these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Mixing tab in the Preferences dialog box and look under the
heading Setup.
You see a screen that looks like Figure 1-14.
3. Deselect the Link Mix/Edit Group Enables option.

Soloing and Muting
Soloing and muting tracks is a big part of the mix process. By being able 
to hear only those tracks you want to hear at a given time, you can find
unwanted sounds lurking in your tracks by soloing the suspected track, or
you can turn off the lead vocal when you tweak the backup vocals. You can
solo and mute each track in the Edit window by clicking the Solo or the 
Mute button (respectively), located underneath the track name, as shown 
on the left side of Figure 1-15. You can do the same thing in the Mix window
by clicking the Solo and Mute buttons located above the volume fader, as
shown on the right side of Figure 1-15. Check out Book III, Chapter 4 for 
more on these windows and the location of the Solo and Mute buttons.
Soloing a track turns the mute function on for the rest of the tracks. You can
solo and mute more than one track at a time. Choose the appropriate button
for each track.
Managing Track Voices
Pro Tools has 32 available voices. This means that you can have only 
32 different mono tracks playing or recording at one time. (With stereo, you
can have only 16 tracks because each stereo track uses two voices.) Because
having more than 32 tracks in a session isn’t that uncommon, you need ways
to manage the 32 available voices so you can hear all your tracks (or at least
the important ones). This can be done one of two ways: setting voice assign-
ments for each track, and setting voice priority. The next two sections give
you the skinny on each method.

Assigning voices
In Pro Tools, the controls for each track let you choose between Off and Dyn
for voice assignments. Figure 1-16 shows the Voice Assignment menu in the
Edit (left) and the Mix (right) windows. With a tracks voice assignment set to
Off, the track won’t play. If you have the track’s voice set to Dyn, Pro Tools
automatically turns that track on and off according to how many voices are
available for playback and where this particular track sits in the Voice
Priority listing. (See the next section for more on voice priorities.)
For example, if you have a session containing 33 tracks, only 32 will play at
any one time. Now, if you have one track (rhythm guitar) that plays only
during the verse and another track (lead guitar) that plays only during the
chorus, you can get these two tracks to trade off so that only one at a time
uses the available voice amongst the 32 — and everybody’s happy because
every note recorded will get heard.
Imagine, though, that both guitar parts have to play in the bridge section of
the song. In this game of musical chairs, one part won’t find one of the 32
available “slots” — and won’t play. Which part ends up being silenced is
determined by how high up the part sits in the list of tracks. You can choose
how high by setting the voice priority of each track, something I cover in the
next section.
Setting voice priority
Because Pro Tools allows you to play only 32 voices but lets you have more
tracks than that in your session, you might need to do some finagling among
the available voices if you want every track (or at least the most important
ones) to be heard throughout the song. To pull off this trick, you have to set
the voice priority of each track.
Figure 1-16:

assignment

Managing Track Voices
257
Voice priority is determined by the track’s position in the tracks list in the
Edit and the Mix windows: The higher its place in the list, the higher its pri-
ority for voice assignment. You can increase the voice priority of a track the
following ways:
✦Using the Show/Hide Tracks List: Click and hold with the pointer over
the track you want, and drag that track up the list.
✦Using the Edit Window: Click and drag the name of the track up the list.
✦Using the Mix Window: Click and drag the name of the track to the left
on the list.
The higher up the list a track is, the higher its priority and the stronger its
claim on the available voices when you assign voices.
Freeing up a voice from a track
Because you can’t make every track the highest priority, here are other ways
to free up (or at least control) how your available voices get used. If you can
identify a voice that’s less crucial at a given moment, you can free that voice
from a track by doing one of the following:
✦Turn the voice assignment to Off. From the Voice Assignment menu,
choose (logically enough) Off. (See the “Assigning voices” section, 
earlier in this chapter, for more on the Voice Assignment menu.)
✦Turn off any output or send assignments for that track.

In This Chapter
 Exploring microphone techniques
 Miking drums
 Miking amplified instruments
 Miking acoustic instruments
You can do all the right things to get your Pro Tools software ready 
to record tracks (see Book III, Chapter 1 for more on that topic), but it
won’t mean diddly if you don’t know how to set up your mics properly.
As you’ll soon find out, the location of a microphone in relation to your
instrument or a singer has a huge impact on the sound of your recording. In
fact, just a movement of an inch or two or even a slight turn of the mic can
bring out different characteristics in the sound. The art of placing mics is
one that you will undoubtedly spend a lifetime discovering.
In this chapter, you discover the fundamentals of using microphones to get
a good source sound. You explore tried-and-true miking methods along with
some practical miking tips and tricks that you can use right away. You also
examine the use of compression and mic placement to control and eliminate
transients — the usual peaks in the instrument’s sound.
Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
Regardless of the style of microphone you use — or the type of instrument
you record — you can use one or more of the following mic placement 
techniques to capture the sound you want:
✦Spot (or close) miking: Put your microphone within a couple feet of the
sound source. This includes instrument-mounted mics.
✦Distant miking: Pull your mic back three to five feet from the sound.
✦Ambient miking: Place your mic way back in a room.
✦Stereo miking: Set up two mics at various distances from one another.

Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
260
✦Combining miking strategies: Use a combination of the four traditional
placement strategies listed here.
This section introduces you to the four traditional mic placement strategies
employed in recording. I cover the characteristics and purposes of each of
these four methods and get a look at how each relates to a particular tonal
or sound quality. I also discuss how you can combine these strategies.
Spot miking
Spot miking (also called close miking) involves placing your microphone
within a couple of feet of the sound source. People with a home-recording
setup use this technique most often because it adds little of the room (the
reverb and delay) to the recorded sound. Figure 2-1 shows the spot miking
placement.
With spot miking, where you place the mic is much more crucial than it is
with any other technique. Because the mic is so close to the sound source,
small adjustments to the mic’s placement make a noticeable difference, and
the mic might not capture the complete sound of the instrument. Finding the
spot that sounds the best can take some trial and error.

Distant miking
When you use distant miking, you place mics about three or four feet away
from the sound source. (See Figure 2-2.) Distant miking enables you to cap-
ture some of the sound of the room along with the instrument. An example
of a distant miking technique is using an overhead drum mic, with which you
can pick up the whole drum set to some extent. Coupled with a few select
spot mics, you can record a natural sound.
Ambient miking
Using ambient miking places the mic far enough away from the sound source
so you capture more of the room sound (the reverb and delay) than the
sound of the actual instrument. (See Figure 2-3.) You can place the mic a
couple of feet away from the source but pointed in the opposite direction, or
you can place it across the room. You can even put the mic in an adjacent
room although this is an unorthodox technique, I’ll admit. The distance that
you choose varies from instrument to instrument. For example, a flute would
need a little closer mic than a double bass would.
Ambient mic placement works well in those places where the room adds to
the sound of the instrument. Home recordists sometimes use stairwells,
bathrooms, or rooms with wood paneling to liven up the sound. The sound
you record is ambient (hence the name): steeped in the sonic qualities of the
surroundings. If you mix this with a spot mic, you can end up with a natural
reverb. If your room doesn’t add to the sound of the instrument, you’re
better off not using any ambient mics. You can always add a room sound 
by using effects in the mixing process. (See Book VI, Chapter 5 for more on
using effects.)

Stereo miking
Stereo miking involves using two mics to capture the stereo field of the
instrument. You can use a variety of stereo miking techniques as well as
some pretty complicated ways of using two mics to record. The three most
common approaches, however, are X-Y (coincident) pairs, the Blumlein 
technique, and spaced pairs. You can also find stereo mics that do a good
job on their own of capturing the stereo field of an instrument.
Stereo miking has the advantage of capturing a natural stereo image. When
you listen to performances that were recorded with well-placed stereo
miking, you can hear exactly where on the stage each instrument performed.
Of course, there is an art to such wonderful stereo miking. You can’t just 
randomly set up a couple of mics in a room and get a good stereo sound.
Capturing a stereo image with two mics requires some careful planning.
X-Y pairs
X-Y (also called coincident) stereo miking uses two mics placed next to each
other so that the diaphragms are at almost-right angles (any where from 90
to 135 degrees) as close together as possible without touching one another.
X-Y stereo miking is the most common type of stereo mic setup and the one
you’ll probably use if you do any stereo miking. Figure 2-4 shows a basic X-Y
setup. Notice how the mics in this figure are attached to a special mounting
bracket. This bracket makes positioning the mics easy.

Blumlein technique
The Blumlein technique is named after Alan Dower Blumlein, who patented
this approach in 1931. Blumlein stereo miking involves placing two figure-8
mics in much the same way as the X-Y pattern (at right angles to one
another with the diaphragms as close together as possible). The two mics
are mounted on separate stands, one above the other. The advantage with
this technique is that the figure-8 mics pick up signals from both the front
and back. This produces a very natural sound. You also don’t have to con-
tend with any proximity effects (enhanced bass response that comes from
being close to the sound source) because figure-8 mics don’t produce this
effect. Figure 2-5 shows this technique. (For more on figure-8 mics, see 
Book I, Chapter 5.)
Spaced pairs
Spaced pair stereo miking places two mics at a distance in front of the instru-
ment(s) you want to record as well as at a distance from one another. This
approach can work well if you record an ensemble that takes up a fairly large
amount of room. Figure 2-6 shows a top view of a typical spaced stereo mic
setup.
One of the most important things to consider when you use spaced pairs for
stereo miking is that they can develop phase problems if you don’t space the
mics properly. For the most part, placing the mics three times further apart
than they are from the sound source takes care of phase problems. This is
the 3:1 rule. (For more on phase problems, see the “Problems with stereo
miking” sidebar in this chapter.)

Stereo microphones
If you want to record an instrument in stereo and don’t want the hassle of
fiddling with setting up stereo pairs, you can use a stereo mic. Stereo mics
basically have two diaphragms in them and use a special cord that allows
you to record the output from each diaphragm on a separate track. Take a
look at an inexpensive stereo condenser mic in Figure 2-7.
Mic combinations
Many times, you’ll want to use more than one mic. The possible combina-
tions are almost limitless: You can use several spot mics on one instrument,
you can use a spot mic and an ambient mic, you can have a distant mic and a
spot mic, or. . . . Well, you get my point. I don’t go into detail in this section,
but I do cover some great ideas (if I do say so myself) in the “Setting Up Your
Mics: Some Suggestions” section, later in this chapter.
Problems with stereo miking
When you use stereo miking, watch out for
phase cancellation and poor stereo imaging.
Phase cancellation happens when the two
microphones are placed in such a way that each
one receives the sound at a slightly different
time. When this occurs, you don’t hear the bass
as well: The low frequencies drop off. Improper
mic placement — or two mics that are out of
phase with one another — can cause phase
cancellation.
Most digital recorders have a phase switch that
allows you to reverse the phase of the signal.
(Pro Tools lets you do this after it’s recorded.) To
test whether two mics are out of phase, just
reverse the phase on one mic (don’t do both) and
listen whether the low frequencies become
more apparent. If they do, you’ve corrected the
problem and you’re good to go. If this doesn’t
correct the problem, try changing cords on one
of the mics because some mic cords are wired
differently. If this doesn’t work either, you need
to adjust the relationship between the two mics.
Just move one around a little and listen for any
changes in the bass response. When the miss-
ing bass appears, you know you’ve solved the
problem.
You have a problem with poor stereo imaging if
you can’t tell clearly where the various instru-
ments or vocals show up from left to right (or
right to left, if that’s how you think), or you can’t
hear a clear center point in the sound. Poor
stereo imaging is a little more difficult to correct
than phase cancellation, but you can fix it.
The solution depends on the stereo miking tech-
nique you use. If you use the X-Y technique, you
probably placed your mics too close to the
sound source. If you use the spaced-pairs tech-
nique, you probably placed the mics too close to
one another in relation to their distance from the
instruments. In either case, adjusting the place-
ment of your mics should clear up the problem.

Taming Transients
266
If you do end up using multiple mic combinations, listen for any phase prob-
lems. Do a couple of run-throughs to get level and balance, and try to correct
phase troubles before you actually record the performance. Of course, because
you’re using Pro Tools, you can deal with some phase problems later. This is
done one of two ways:
✦Use the Invert command from the AudioSuites menu. Choose
AudioSuites➪Invert from the main menu.
✦Move your tracks around in your session to line up the waveforms.
This is time aligning, which I cover in Book IV, Chapter 3.
Taming Transients
The single most difficult part of getting a good sound by using a microphone
is dealing with sudden, extreme increases in the sound signal. These blips
are transients, and they happen when a drum is first struck, when a vocalist
sings certain syllables (for example, those that begin with P), and when a
guitar player picks certain notes. In fact, because you can’t always control
the amount of force that you apply to an instrument, transients can happen
any time — with any instrument — and without warning. (Highly trained
musicians produce fewer transients because they have a greater mastery
over their muscular movements.)

Taming Transients
267
In digital recording, all it takes is one slight, unexpected note to cause clip-
ping and distortion, ruining what might be a perfect musical performance.
Believe me: Nothing is as heart-wrenching as listening to the perfect take and
hearing the unmistakable sound of digital distortion. Although you can’t
eliminate transients completely (they are part of an instrument’s character),
you can tame the extreme transients that often cause digital overs (a thick
signal at too high of a level, resulting in distortion). You can lash ’em down in
three ways:
✦Set your levels properly so the transients don’t overload the 
converters.
✦Make sure you have proper mic placement.
✦Run the signal through a compressor when recording.
A compressor is a piece of hardware (not included in your Digidesign
interface) that controls the dynamics of your signal to keep your levels
from getting too high.
Setting your levels properly
Back in the days of 16-bit digital recording (in ancient times, oh, ten years 
or so ago), you wanted to record at as high a level as possible without going
over the maximum of 0 decibels (dB). The idea was to ensure the highest-
possible fidelity by using as many of the available 16 bits as possible. If you
recorded at lower levels, you used fewer bits, resulting in lower fidelity and
higher noise levels.
Now, in the advanced age of digital, your best bet is to record with 24-bit res-
olution. Those extra 8 bits gained since the olden days free you from having
to record at the highest level possible. In fact, you can put your max levels
down around –12dB and still end up with great-sounding tracks. Giving your-
self that kind of room (called, logically enough, headroom) allows an instru-
ment’s transients to be recorded without causing problems with your
converters.
I highly recommend recording with peak levels no more than –12dB or –10dB
unless you run the incoming signal through a compressor before it hits your
converters. Sure, your tracks will be quieter, but you can deal with that
during mixing (Book VI, Chapter 1) and mastering (Book VII, Chapter 1).
Placing mics properly
A microphone that’s too close to a loud sound source (or pointed too directly
at the point of attack) can easily pick up extreme transients. In most cases, 
all you have to do is to pull the mic away from the instrument a little or turn
it ever so slightly so it avoids picking up too high a signal. (I cover mic setup
thoroughly in the “Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions” section.)

Taming Transients
268
The main thing to keep in mind when placing your microphones is to experi-
ment. Don’t be afraid to spend time making small adjustments. After all, the
track you save could be your own.
Compressing carefully
Compressors are processors that allow you to control the dynamics of a
signal — extremes of loudness or softness — and boy, are they ever versa-
tile. You can use them on the front end while tracking (recording) instru-
ments to ward off any stray transients. You can use them to level off an
erratic performance. And you can use them to raise the overall apparent
level of a mixed song. In this section, you explore the first use of compres-
sion: the control of transients. (You can find out about the other ways to use
compression in Book VI, Chapter 3 and in Book VII, Chapter 2.)
The compressor is an invaluable tool when you record digitally because it
enables you to record at high levels without worrying as much about digital
clipping. The only problem is that the careful use of compression is an art
that normally takes a while to get the hang of. Don’t worry, though. In this
chapter, you get some guidelines for using compression. And in Book VI,
Chapter 4, I offer quite a few conservative compression settings for a variety
of instruments to get you started.
Pro Tools includes a compressor plug-in with the software program. 
You can use this built-in compression if you’re tweaking a session you
already recorded. For that matter, you can use this feature when you’re
recording your tracks, but that won’t do you any good. Remember that the
Pro Tools compression system is digital: It can’t work with analog signals.
Your signal has to go through the A/D converter (and get changed from
analog to digital) on its way to being recorded. The A/D converter in your
Digidesign interface — not the compression plug-in — is first in line after the
preamp. All this defeats the purpose of using a compressor to control tran-
sients. (Bummer.) In fact, the A/D converter is usually where you often get
your first dose of distortion. (Ditto.) If you’re serious about using compres-
sion on the front end to tame those transients, consider using an external
preamp that you can insert into the signal chain before the A/D converter:
that is, before the signal gets to your Digidesign interface.
Compressors have a series of dials that allow you to adjust several 
parameters:
✦Threshold: This setting dictates the level at which the compressor
starts to act on the signal, listed in decibels. For the most part, you want
to set the threshold level so the compressor acts on only the highest
peaks of the signal.

Book III
Chapter 2
Miking: Getting a
Great Source Sound
Taming Transients
269
✦Ratio: This setting determines the amount that the compressor affects
the signal. The ratio — such as 2:1, for instance — means that for every
decibel that the signal goes over the threshold setting, it is reduced by
two. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor will only be ƒ 1/2 dB louder. The ratio is the
one parameter that varies considerably from instrument to instrument
because the level of the transient varies.
✦Attack: This knob controls how soon the compressor starts, well, 
compressing. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms); the lower the
number, the faster the attack. For the most part, you’re trying to control
transients, and they happen at the beginning of a note. Therefore, you
want the attack set to act quickly.
✦Release: This parameter controls how long the compressor continues 
to affect the note after it starts. Like the attack, the release is defined 
in milliseconds. Because transients don’t last very long, your best bet 
is usually a short release time if you’re using compression on the 
front end.
✦Gain: Use this knob to adjust the level of the signal leaving the compres-
sor. The setting is listed in decibels. Because adding compression 
generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use this control to
raise the level back up to where it was going in.
✦Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of
choosing one or the other of these odd-sounding settings (or they do it
for you, based on the setting you’ve chosen). Both refer to how the 
compressor behaves as the input signal passes the threshold.
• A hard knee applies the compression at an even rate, regardless of
how far over the threshold the level is. Thus, if you choose a com-
pression setting of 4:1, the compressor applies this ratio for any
signal over the threshold limit. Hard-knee compression is used for
instruments such as drums, where you need to clamp down on any
transients quickly.
• The soft knee, by contrast, applies the compression at a varying rate
that depends on how far over the threshold setting the signal is. The
compressor gradually increases the ratio of the compression as the
signal crosses the threshold until the amount matches the level you
set. Soft-knee compression is used on vocals and on instruments
where the signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Using compression is an art form. There is no one way to get the sound 
you want. Although I go into detail on compression and offer some great
compressor settings for a variety of applications in Book VI, Chapter 4, keep
in mind a couple of things while you think about using compression on 
your tracks:

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
270
✦You can always add compression to a recorded track, but you can
never take it away. If you’re not sure how much compression to apply
to a particular situation, you’re much better off erring on the side of 
too little because you can always run the sound through another com-
pressor if you need to.
✦If you can hear a change in the sound of your signal, you most likely
have it set too high. The reason to use a compressor on the front end is
to eliminate extreme transients, which you can’t hear when you play
anyway. If your compression setting changes the sound at all, you would
want to turn it down slightly — unless, of course, you’re going for that
effect.
Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
When you start to record, you discover an almost infinite number of ways to
set up your mics. I can’t go into them all here (as if I really knew them all,
anyway), but what I can do is share the miking approaches that I use and
have found to work for me. Okay, they’re not just my approaches; they’re
pretty common ways for miking a variety of instruments.
Telling you that a particular mic position will work for you is like telling you
that you’ll like a particular ice cream flavor. I don’t know your tastes, goals,
or specific recording conditions, so I can’t truly know what will work for you
beforehand. Think of the miking techniques in this chapter as a starting
point — and don’t be afraid to experiment until you find the sound you want.
There’s no absolute right or wrong when it comes to miking. There’s only
what works for you and what doesn’t. (Book I, Chapter 5 talks more about
microphone types and how they’re used.)
Vocals
Regardless of the type of studio you have or the style of music that you
record, you’ll probably record vocals at some point. And unfortunately,
vocals are one of the most challenging instruments to do well. First, you
have to find the right mic for the person who’s singing, and then you need to
try different approaches in order to get the best sound out of him or her.
Fortunately, you’re in luck. In the next few sections, I lead you through the
(sometimes complicated) process of getting good lead and backup vocal
sounds.
The room and the vocals
To get the best recording of vocals possible, you need a dead room — a
room with no reverberation. (Book I, Chapter 2 has some tips on how to

Book III
Chapter 2
Miking: Getting a
Great Source Sound
Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
271
deaden your room.) Recording vocals in a dead room gives a sense of “pres-
ence” and allows you to add compression to the vocals without making them
sound distant. (This results because the compressor raises the level of the
background noise, particularly the reverberation from a live room that
bounces the sound around a lot.)
The easiest way to deaden your room for vocal recording is to hang curtains,
carpet, or blankets around the room, or to use the absorbent side of the
reflector/absorber panels that I discuss in Book I, Chapter 2. Try to cover 
the area in front — and to both sides — of the vocal with sound-absorbent
materials. (If you use the reflector/absorber panels that I describe in Book I,
Chapter 2, you’d better use the stands because the panels are only four 
feet tall.)
The mics and the vocals
You have a lot of options for miking vocals. The type of mic you use dictates
where you place it. Here’s the gist:
✦Dynamic mic: Dynamic mics sound best when you place them close to
the singer’s mouth. The effect that you get is gritty. (Huh? Okay, by
gritty, I mean dirty. That’s no help either? Let me see. . . .)
Dynamic mics produce a midrange-dominated sound: The high frequen-
cies aren’t reproduced well. You’ll find that when a singer sings with the
mic right in front of his or her mouth, the sound lacks even more high fre-
quencies because of the proximity effect. That is, close range enhances
the low-frequency response. What you get is a deep, bass-heavy sound
that’s often described as gritty or dirty. This type of sound can be great
for matching the mood of some styles of rock and blues music.
To set up a dynamic mic for this purpose, just put it on a stand so the
singer can get his or her mouth right up against the windscreen. With
this type of singing style, I recommend a compressor setting that pumps
and breathes — that is, you can hear the compressor working. See my
discussion of compression in Book VI, Chapter 4 for a recommended 
setting.
✦Large-diaphragm condenser mic: Large-diaphragm condenser mics are
those most commonly used for vocals. These mics can clearly repro-
duce the entire audible frequency spectrum, emphasizing the low mids
slightly at the same time. What you get is a nice warm, full-bodied
sound. (That sounds like I’m describing a wine.) The proximity effect
(how close the singer is to the mic) determines how nice and warm-
bodied the sound is. The closer the singer is, the deeper and richer the
tone can be.

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
272
When you set up a large-diaphragm condenser mic for vocals, place the
mic in such a way that the nasty sibilants (the sound from singing S and
Sh sounds) and pesky plosives (pops from singing P and T syllables)
don’t mess up your recordings. To deal with plosives and sibilants, you
can either use a pop filter (see Book I, Chapter 2) or have the singer sing
past (instead of right into) the mic. If you want the singer to sing past
the mic, you can
• Place the mic above the singer and set it at an angle pointing away
from him or her. (See the left side of Figure 2-8.)
• Set up the mic below the singer and angle it away from him or her.
(See the right side of Figure 2-8.)
• Put the mic off to the side and face it toward the singer (the center of
Figure 2-8) but not squarely in the path of the vocal.
✦Small-diaphragm condenser mic: Small-diaphragm condenser mics
create a much brighter, airier sound than their large-diaphragm cousins.
You don’t get the low-mid warmth of the large-diaphragm beast, so a
small-diaphragm mic probably won’t be your first choice as a vocal mic
unless (for example) you’re recording a female vocalist with a soprano
voice and you want to catch the more ethereal quality of her higher 
frequencies.
You set up a small-diaphragm mic the same way you set up a large
diaphragm mic.
✦Ribbon mic: A ribbon mic is a good choice if you’re looking for an 
intimate, crooner-type sound. (Think Frank Sinatra.) The ribbon mic is
thought to add a silky sound to the singer’s voice, produced by a slight
dropoff in the high frequencies (not as severe as you’d get from a
dynamic mic). To my drum-abused ears, ribbon mics have a kind of 
softness that large-diaphragm condenser mics don’t have. The sound is
more even, without the pronounced low-mid effect.

If you use a ribbon mic, you can set it up the same way you set up a con-
denser mic. You just need to be more careful about singing directly into
a ribbon mic because the ribbon can break if you sing, speak, or breathe
too hard into it.
Backup vocals
To record backup vocals, you can either track each part separately (using
the same mic placement techniques that I describe earlier), or you can 
have all the backup singers sing at once into one or two mics. If you go for
the latter method, you can use a stereo pair of mics, a figure-8 mic, or an
omnidirectional mic.
If you use a stereo pair, I recommend setting them up in a coincident X-Y 
pattern. Have the vocalists stand next to each other, facing the mics at a 
distance of about three or four feet. Either large- or small-diaphragm mics
work best for this setup. Check out Figure 2-9 for a neat top view of this
arrangement.
If you choose to use a figure-8 mic, the singers can be placed at opposite
sides of the mic (see Figure 2-10). The advantage of this setup is that the
singers can look at each other while they sing, which helps keep the 
vocals tight.

Electric guitar
Miking your electric guitar is a personal thing. Every guitar player, it seems
to me (although I don’t play guitar, so what do I know?), spends an awful 
lot of time getting his or her “sound.” If you’re a real guitar player, you
undoubtedly take great pride in getting your sound exactly right on tape —
er, disc. You likely spend countless hours tweaking your amp and adjusting
the mic to get it just right. On the other hand, if you’re not a (harrumph)
“real” guitar player, you might just want to record the part and get it over
with. Either way, you can start looking for that perfect guitar sound by plac-
ing your mics in one (or more) of the ways that I outline later in this chapter.
The room and the guitar
Whether you play through a small jazz chorus amp or power-chord your way
through a six-foot Marshall stack, the room that you play in has less impact
on your sound than it does if you play drums or sing. For the most part, look
for a room that is fairly dead — a room without natural reverberation. You
can always add effects later.
Guitar miking involves mostly spot mics, so your only consideration when
recording a guitar and using an amp is how your neighbors feel about the
noise, er, your most excellent guitar playing.
If you have finicky neighbors, you can put your guitar amp inside an amp-
isolator box (see Book I, Chapter 2) to cut down on the noise. You can find
the plans to build one on my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com. (Or, hey, you
could try plugging the guitar directly into your Digidesign interface. You
might like the sound you get. More about that in a minute.)
The mics and the guitar
The type of mic you choose depends largely on the type of sound you’re
looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a distorted rock guitar sound
with effects, you can get by just fine with a dynamic mic. If you favor a 
clean sound, a small-diaphragm condenser mic might work better for you. 
If you’re going for a warm, full-bodied sound, try using a large-diaphragm
condenser mic.
No matter which type of mic you use, you get the best sound from your amp
speakers by putting the mic about 2 to 12 inches away from the cabinet, with
the mic pointing directly at the cone of one of the amp speakers (specifically,
the center of the speaker, which is that cone-shaped thing in the box). You
can see this positioning in Figure 2-12.

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
276
You might want to experiment with how far the mic is from the amp and the
angle at which you point it. Sometimes just a slight movement in or out, left
or right, can make all the difference in the world. You can even try pointing
the mic at different speakers (if your amp has more than one) because each
speaker has a slightly different sound.
For speaker cabinets that have more than one speaker, I know some 
engineers who actually disconnect all but one speaker to lower the overall
volume without losing the intense, distorted sound. This can be especially
beneficial if you have one of those amp stacks with a volume knob that 
goes to 11, and you just gotta crank the amp to get your “tone.” (Come on,
rockers, you know who you are.) This way you don’t overload the mic
(which creates the wrong kind of distortion) and can still get that nasty
sound you’re looking for.
If you can’t quite get the sound that you want from your amp with the one
mic pointed at the speaker cone, try adding a second mic about three or four
feet away — also pointed directly at the speaker cone — to get a more ambi-
ent sound. This arrangement might also give your sound more life, especially
if you have a room with natural reverberation. If you add a second mic, 
however, remember to watch for phase differences between the mics and
make adjustments accordingly. (I discuss phase cancellation earlier in this
chapter.)

Are you sick of the same old sound coming out of your amp? Wanna really
shake things up (and I mean this literally)? Well, put your guitar amp in a
tiled bathroom and crank it up. You can put a mic in the bathroom with your
amp (a couple of feet away) and maybe another one just outside the door
(experiment with how much you close or open the door). The effect is, 
well. . . . Try it and find out for yourself. 
Electric bass
When you mic an electric bass, getting a good sound can be a real bear. 
Your two adversaries are muddiness (lack of definition) and thinness (a pro-
nounced midrange tone). These seem almost polar-opposite characteristics,
but they can both exist at the same time. I outline the best way to avoid
these problems in the following sections.
Running your bass guitar directly into the board — via a direct box, your
amp’s Line Out jack, or a preamped input on your Digidesign interface —
gives the guitar a punchier sound.
The room and the bass
The sound of an electric bass guitar can get muddy awfully fast. Your best
bet is to choose a room that doesn’t have a lot of reflective surfaces (such as
paneled walls and wooden floors) that bounce the sound around. A dead
room is easier to work with. Don’t make your room too dead, however, or it
just sucks the life out of your amp’s tone. If you can get your amp to sound
good in your room, placing the mic properly is easy.
Don’t be afraid to be creative and to try recording your bass in different
rooms. Look for a room with a warm sound to it. One thing, though: The
bathroom amp trick doesn’t work too well for a bass guitar, but it can be fun
to try anyway.
The mics and the bass
Because the bass guitar produces low frequencies, a dynamic mic or a 
large-diaphragm condenser mic works well. I personally avoid using small-
diaphragm condensers and ribbon mics for an electric bass, but try them if
you want. Who knows? You might end up with an awesome bass track.
Mic placement for the electric bass is similar to the guitar; you place a 
single mic 2 to 12 inches away from one of the speakers. Sometimes, with
bass, you can angle the mic and let the speaker’s sound kind of drift past the
diaphragm. Potentially, it’s a great sound. For a bass, skip the distant mic
(which generally just adds muddiness to the sound).

Acoustic guitars and such
At the risk of offending banjo, dobro, or ukulele players, I’m lumping all 
guitarlike (strummed or picked) acoustic string instruments together. 
I know, they all sound and play differently, but the microphone-placement
techniques are similar for all these instruments. Allow me to explain.
Because all these instruments have a resonating chamber and are played
with the instrument facing forward, you can pretty much use the same mic
placement for any of them. You use different types of mics for different
instruments, and I get to that in a minute.
The room and acoustic instruments
For recording acoustic instruments, the room plays a role in the sound that
you end up recording. Unless you have a great-sounding room, you want to
minimize its impact on your instrument’s sound. You can do this in a couple
of ways:
✦By recording with spot mics
✦By placing absorber/reflectors in strategic places around your room
• Absorberside-out (toward the walls) if the room is too live
• Reflector-side-out if the room is too dead
For example, if your studio is in a spare bedroom with carpeting and that
awful popcorn stuff on the ceiling, you can put a couple of the reflector
panels around your guitar player and the mic. This adds some reverberation
to your guitar. Any unwanted reflections from the ceiling or walls are
shielded from the mics because the absorber sides of the panels are facing
the rest of the room.
The mics and the acoustic instruments
I prefer to use condenser mics when recording acoustic instruments. The
type of condenser mic you use depends on the overall tonal quality that you
want to capture or emphasize. For example, if a guitar has a nice, woody
sound that you want to bring out in the recording, a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re trying to capture
the brightness of a banjo, a small-diaphragm mic is a better choice.
You can position your microphone in a variety of ways, and each accents
certain aspects of the instrument’s sound. Even a slight adjustment to the
mic can have a significant impact on the sound. You might have to experi-
ment quite a bit to figure out exactly where to put a mic.

To help with your experimentation, listen to the guitar carefully and move
the mic around (closer in and farther out, to the left and right) until you find
a spot that sounds particularly good. You need to get your ears close to the
guitar to do this.
Here are some suggestions to get you started:
✦Put the mic about 6 to 18 inches away from and 3 to 4 inches below 
the point where the neck meets the body of the guitar (or banjo, or
whatever). Then make minor adjustments to the direction in which the
mic points. Pointing it toward the sound hole(s) often gives you a richer,
deeper tone. (This can translate to muddiness on some instruments.)
Turning the mic more toward the neck brings out the instrument’s
brighter qualities. (See the image on the left in Figure 2-13.)
✦Place a mic about three feet away from the instrument and point it
directly at the sound hole. At this distance, you capture the rich sound
from the sound hole and the attack of the strings. See the center image
in Figure 2-13.
✦Put a mic about six inches out from the bridge of the guitar. Try pointing
the mic in different directions (slight movements of an inch or less can
make a huge difference) until you find the spot that sounds best to you.
See the image on the right in Figure 2-13.
✦Try setting up a mic at about the same distance and angle from the
instrument as the player’s ears. Point the mic down toward the instru-
ment so the mic is a couple of inches away from either side of the 
musician’s head. This is an unorthodox approach that I like because 
I’ve found that guitar players adjust their playing style and intonation to
correspond to what they’re hearing when they play. With this technique,
you’re trying to capture exactly what the musician hears.

Drum set
If you’re like most musicians, getting great-sounding drums seems like one of
the world’s great mysteries. (You know, along the lines of how the pyramids
were built or how to cure cancer.) You can hear big, fat drums on great
albums but when you try to record your drums, they always end up sound-
ing more like cardboard boxes than drums. Fret not (hey, at least I didn’t say
that in the guitar section) because I have solutions for you.
First things first: Tuning your drums
The single most important part of getting killer drum sounds is to make sure
your drums are tuned properly and that they have good heads on them.
(Okay, that’s two things.) Seriously, if you spend some time getting the
drums to sound good in your room, you’re already halfway to the drum
sound of your dreams. There isn’t space to go into detail here (especially if
you play a large kit), but if you want specific drum-tuning guidance, you can
do a search on the Internet or (ahem) check out a copy of my book, Drums
For Dummies (Wiley).
You’re looking for a clear, open tone on your drums. By and large, resist the
temptation to apply duct tape or other dampeners to the drumheads. Drums
that are deadened and don’t ring clearly are definitely going to sound like
cardboard boxes when you record them.
After you get your drums tuned as well as you can, the next step is to take
care of any rattles that might be coming from the stands or mounting hard-
ware. Tighten up any loose hardware and move any stands that may be
touching one another. You might need to make some small adjustments to
the pitches of your drums if they’re causing any hardware to rattle.
If you still have some ringing or unwanted overtones, you can deaden the
drums slightly. Cotton gauze taped lightly on the edge of the head (away
from the drummer) is often enough. If you want a really dry sound on your
snare drum, you can use the wallet trick: Have the drummer place his or her
wallet on the head. (Use the drummer’s wallet — it’ll probably be lighter
because of all the money that isn’t in it.)
When the tuning of your drums is perfect, you’re ready to start placing some
microphones. You can choose from an unlimited number of miking configu-
rations, only a few of which I can cover here. (It would take a whole book to
cover them all.)
The room and the drums
The room influences the drums’ sound more than it influences that of the
other instruments. If you’re looking for a big drum sound, you need a fairly
live room (one with lots of reflection).

I know you’re thinking, “But all I have to work with is a bedroom for a studio,
and it’s carpeted.” No worries; you can work with that. Remember, if you
have a home studio, potentially you have your whole home to work with.
Here are a couple of ideas to spark your imagination:
✦Buy three or four 4' x 2' sheets of plywood and lean them up against the
walls of your room. Also place one on the floor just in front of the kick
drum. This adds some reflective surfaces to the room.
✦Put the drums in your garage (or living room, or any other room with a
reverberating sound) and run long mic cords to your mixer. If you have a
laptop computer for your Pro Tools system, you can just throw it under
your arm and move everything into your garage. Or, better yet, take all
this stuff to a really great-sounding room and record.
✦Set up your drums in a nice-sounding room and place an additional mic
just outside the door to catch some additional ambient sound. You can
then mix this with the other drum tracks to add a different quality of
reverberation to the drums.
Kick (bass) drum considerations
The mic of choice for most recording engineers when recording a kick drum
is a dynamic mic. In fact, you can find some large-diaphragm, dynamic mics
specifically designed to record kick drums.
No matter where you place the mic, you can reduce the amount of boomi-
ness that you get from the drum by placing a pillow or blanket inside the
drum. Some people choose to let the pillow or blanket touch the inside 
head. I prefer to keep it a couple of inches away from the inside head, but
sometimes it’s okay to let it touch the outside head.
That said, you can place your mic in several ways (all conveniently illus-
trated in Figure 2-14):
✦Near the inside head: If you take off the outside head or cut a hole in it,
you can stick the mic inside the drum. Place the mic two to three inches
away from the inside head and a couple of inches off center. This is the
standard way to mic a kick drum if you have the outside head off or if a
hole is cut in it. This placement gives you a sharp attack from the beater
hitting the head.
✦Halfway inside the drum: You can modify the preceding miking tech-
nique by moving the mic back so it’s about halfway inside the drum. In
this case, place the mic right in the middle, pointing at where the beater
strikes the drum. This placement gives you less of the attack of the
beater striking the head and more of the body of the drum’s sound.

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
282
✦Near the outside head: If you have both heads on the drum, you can
place the mic a few inches from the outside head. If you want a more
open, boomy sound (and you have the drum’s pitch set fairly high),
point the mic directly at the center of the head. If you want less boom,
offset the mic a little and point it about two-thirds of the way toward 
the center.
If your drum sounds thin after trying these mic placement approaches, you
can try these two things:
✦Tune the drum slightly higher. In your quest for a deep bass tone, you
might have tuned the drum too low. (This is especially common if you
have a large bass drum.) In this case, the drum’s fundamental tone might
be too low to be heard clearly. Raising the pitch a bit usually solves the
problem.
✦Create a tunnel with acoustic panels. Putting the mic in the tunnel often
helps if you have a room that’s too dead. Place two of the panels on their
sides (reflective surfaces facing into the room) with one end of each
panel near the outside of the drum. Angle the panels out so that where
they are farthest from the drum set, the distance between them is just
less than four feet. Then lay the other two panels (reflective surface
facing down) across the side panels to create a tunnel. You can also
place a piece of plywood on the floor under these panels to further
increase the resonance. Place the mic halfway into the tunnel, facing the
center of the drum.
Snare drum considerations
A snare drum is probably the most important drum in popular music. The
bass guitar can cover the kick drum’s rhythm, and the rest of the drums
aren’t part of the main groove. A good, punchy snare drum can make a 
track, whereas a weak, thin one can eliminate the drive that most popular
music needs.

Because the snare drum is located so close to the other drums (especially
the hi-hats), a cardioid pattern mic is a must. The most common mic for a
snare drum is the trusty Shure SM57. The mic is generally placed between
the hi-hats and the small tom-tom about one or two inches from the snare
drum head (see Figure 2-15). Point the diaphragm directly at the head. You
might need to make some minor adjustments to eliminate any bleed from the
hi-hats. This position gives you a nice, punchy sound.
If you want a crisper tone, you can add a second mic under the drum. Place
this mic about an inch or two from the head with the diaphragm pointing at
the snares. Make minor adjustments to minimize any leakage from the hi-hats.
What type of drum set?
If you want to buy a drum set for your studio, here
are some guidelines that have worked for me:
 Smaller drums can sound bigger. At one
point, I had two top-notch Gretsch drum sets
in my studio. One was a rock kit that had a
24" kick; 13", 14", and 12" tom-toms; and a 6 1⁄2"
(deep) metal snare drum. The other was a
small jazz kit, consisting of a 12" kick; 10" and
14" tom-toms; and a 5" (deep) wood snare.
Guess what? Even for the hardest rock
music, the small kit sounded much bigger.
You tune the small drums down a bit, and
they just sing!
 Choose your heads wisely. Not all heads are
equal. Some sound great on stage, but others
are better suited for the studio. Because the
heads that come with a kit are (most likely)
not the ones that sound the best on a record-
ing, invest some money in testing different
drumheads on your kit. I prefer either Remo
pinstripes (great for rock and R&B) or coated
ambassadors (great for jazz) on the top and
either clear or coated ambassadors (either
works, I just choose what I like to look at) on
the bottom of the drum.
 Use cymbals with a fast decay.Cymbals that
sound great on stage are different from
those that sound great in the studio. Stage
cymbals often have long decays and slow
attacks. This causes bleeding, especially
through the tom-tom mics, and correcting
the problem can be a headache. If you buy
cymbals for your studio, choose those that
have a very fast attack and a short decay.
 More expensive isn’t always better. For
recording, my favorite drum sets are used
kits from the late 1960s and early 1970s. My
all-time favorite recording set is a late 1960s
Gretsch jazz drum set with a 12" kick drum, a
10" mounted tom-tom, and a 14" floor tom. For
a snare, I love old 5" wooden snare drums
(Gretsch, Ludwig, Slingerland, whatever).
The last one of these sets I bought cost me
$350, including all the mounting hardware
and snare drum. It wasn’t pretty, but boy, did
it sound great.

If you have the available tracks, record each snare mic to a separate track
and blend the two later during mixdown. If you don’t have the available
tracks, blend them until you have the sound that you want. You can also try
reversing the phase of the bottom mic. (Some preamps have a phase switch
for each channel, or you can reverse the phase by choosing AudioSuite➪
Other➪Invert from the main menu.) Some people prefer the sound of the
bottom mic this way.
Tom-toms
Tom-toms sound best when you use a dynamic mic. For mounted toms (the
ones above the kick drum), you can use one or two mics. If you use one mic,
place it between the two drums about four to six inches away from the
heads. (Figure 2-16 shows this placement option.) If you use two mics, place
one above each drum about one to three inches above the head.
If you want a boomy sound with less attack, you can place a mic inside the
shell with the bottom head off the drum.
Floor toms are miked the same way as mounted tom-toms:
✦Place a single mic a couple of inches away from the head near the rim.
✦If you have more than one floor tom, you can place one mic between
them or mic them individually.

Hi-hats
Hi-hats are generally part of the main groove — as such, they’re important
enough that you want to spend some time getting a good sound. You’ll 
probably have problems with a few other mics on the drum set picking up
the hi-hats, particularly the snare drum mic and overhead mics. (Some
people don’t even bother miking the hi-hats for this reason.)
I like to mic hi-hats because, to me, these cymbals often sound too trashy
through the snare-drum mic. If you mic the hi-hats, make sure that the 
snare-drum mic is picking up as little of the hi-hats as possible by placing 
it properly.
You can use either a dynamic mic or, better yet, a small diaphragm con-
denser mic for the hi-hats. The dynamic mic gives you a trashier sound, and
the small diaphragm condenser mic produces a bright sound. You can work
with either by adjusting the EQ. I usually add just a little bit (4dB or so) of a
shelf equalizer set at 10 kHz to add just a little sheen to the hi-hats. Book VI,
Chapter 3 covers EQ in detail.
Place the mic about three to four inches above the hi-hats and point it down.
The exact placement of the mic is less important than the placement of the
other instrument mics because of the hi-hats’ tone. Just make sure your mic
isn’t so close that you hit it instead of the cymbal.

Cymbals
You want to know one secret to the huge drum sound of the Led Zeppelin
drummer, John Bonham? Finesse. He understood (I’m guessing, because I
never really talked to him about this) that the drums sound louder and
bigger in a mix if the cymbals are quieter in comparison. So he played his
cymbals softly and hit the drums pretty hard. This allowed the engineer to
boost the levels of the drums without having the cymbals drown everything
else out. Absolutely brilliant.
Because the drums bleeding into the overhead mics is inevitable and the
overhead mics are responsible for providing much of the drums’ presence in
a mix, playing the cymbals softly allows you to get more of the drums in
these mics. This helps the drums sound bigger.
Ask (no, demand) that your drummer play the cymbals more quietly. Also
use smaller cymbals with a fast attack and a short decay. Doing these things
creates a better balance between the drums and cymbals and makes the
drums stand out more in comparison.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics capture the cymbals’ high frequencies
well. You can mic the cymbals by placing mics about six inches above each
cymbal or by using overhead mics set one to three feet above the cymbals.
(See the next section for more on overhead mic placement.)
The whole kit
Most of the time, you want to have at least one (but preferably two) ambient
mics on the drums, if for no other reason than to pick up the cymbals. These
(assuming you use two mics) are overhead mics, and (as the name implies)
you place them above the drum set (usually by means of a boom stand). The
most common types of mics to use for overheads are large- and small-
diaphragm condenser mics because they pick up the high frequencies in the
cymbals and give the drum set’s sound a nice sheen (brightness). You also
might want to try a pair of ribbon mics to pick up a nice, sweet sound on the
overheads.
Remember that ribbon mics can be fragile.
To mic the drum set with overhead mics, you can use either the X-Y coinci-
dent technique or spaced stereo pairs. Place them one to two feet above the
cymbals, just forward of the drummer’s head. Place X-Y mics in the center
and set up spaced stereo pairs so they follow the 3:1 rule. (The mics should
be set up three to six feet apart if they are one to two feet above the cym-
bals.) This counters any phase problems. Point the mic down toward the
drums, and you’re ready to record. Figure 2-17 shows both of these setups.

Hand drums
Hand drums can be anything from the familiar conga to unusual drums such
as the North African tar, Middle Eastern doumbek, or Brazilian Pandeiro.
Because you might encounter many types of hand drums, this section gives
you some general guidelines when recording any hand drum.
Your selection in mics depends on the type of drum and its tonal character-
istics. For example, conga drums occupy the middle of the frequency spec-
trum and produce a loud sound that a large diaphragm condenser mic can
capture well. Or if you want a tighter, drier sound, you can use a dynamic
mic. If you choose the dynamic mic, the mic colors the sound of your 
recording.
If you want to record any number of the smaller, higher-pitched hand drums,
use either a large or small diaphragm condenser mic and skip the dynamic
mic altogether.
Mic placement also varies considerably among the various hand drums. Listen
to the sound of the drum and find a place where you like what you hear. For
the most part, placing the mic anywhere from one to three feet from the 
drum creates the fullest sound. If you want a lot of attack, you can place the
mic closer. You lose some of the drum’s depth, however, when you place 
the mic closer than one foot.
Percussion
Miscellaneous percussion instruments, such as shakers and triangles, are
nice additions to many styles of music. These instruments sound best with a
good condenser mic. I choose a large or small diaphragm mic, depending on
the characteristics that I want to pick up. For instance, a shaker can sound
great with a large diaphragm mic because this mic brings out the lower 
frequencies of the instrument slightly and softens the overall sound a bit.
X-Y mics 1-2 feet above cymbals

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
288
The room and the percussion
Most of the time, the room doesn’t have a huge effect on percussion instru-
ments because you mic them closely. If your room does get in the way, use
the acoustic panels in much the same way that I suggest for vocals earlier in
this chapter (partially surround the mic and musician with baffles).
The mics and the percussion
Both large and small diaphragm mics work well for percussion. The main
thing to remember when recording percussion instruments is that they can
have a high SPL (Sound Pressure Level, or just plain volume), so you might
need to pad the mic.
As far as mic placement goes, I like to put a single mic anywhere from 6 to 18
inches away, depending on the size of the instrument. For example, because
maracas are loud, I put the mic back a bit (18 inches), whereas with a 
triangle, I find that 6 to 8 inches sounds best.

fter you get your mics set up — see Chapter 2 of this mini-book for
more on that — and before you actually start to record, you can still
do a few things to make the process easier and to optimize the performance
of your system. This chapter covers all you need to do before you actually
start to record. For starters, this includes understanding and using Record
modes and dealing with disk allocation.
This chapter also shows you how to enable your tracks to record, set your
levels to give you the best sound possible, and manage your monitoring
setup to perform at your best. To top it off, this chapter guides you through
setting up a click track, song tempo, and meter map so when it comes time
to edit your audio (not that your performances need editing), you’ll be able
to do it quicker and with less effort. If you’re not sure what click tracks, tempo
maps, and meter maps are, don’t worry. By the time you finish this chapter,
you’ll be throwing these terms around like a seasoned sound engineer.
Recognizing Record Modes
Pro Tools offers the following four Record modes: Non-Destructive, Destructive,
Loop, and QuickPunch. You can choose the mode you want by selecting the
mode from the Options section of the main menu (choose Options➪Quick
Punch) or by Control-clicking (Mac) or right-clicking (PC) the Record button
in the Transport window. All this clicking cycles you through the four
Record modes.
Each Record mode has its place, and knowing which one to use for a given
situation can help you greatly in the efficiency department. These different
modes are detailed in the following sections.

Recognizing Record Modes
290
You can see which mode you’re in by looking at the Record button in the
Transport window. The modes are designated, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Non-Destructive Record mode
Non-destructive recording is the default setting in Pro Tools. Whenever you
record in this mode, a new audio file is created without erasing any previous
files or regions. This new file automatically gets added to the Audio Regions
list, where it resides with other recorded files. (This list is located on the right
side of the Edit window. If it’s not visible, click the double arrow at the bottom
right of the Edit window.)
Destructive Record mode
Recording in Destructive Record mode erases any and all previously recorded
audio regions found on that particular track, which basically mirrors the way
traditional analog tape recorders work. This can be handy for keeping your
hard drives from becoming full quickly, but you don’t get a chance to use a
previous take after you recorded over it. Because Non-Destructive Record
mode is the default mode (see the preceding section), you need to select
Destructive Record mode from either the Options menu (choose Options➪
Destructive from the main menu) or Control-click (Mac) or right-click (PC) the
Record button in the Transport window until the D icon appears on the Record
button, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Loop Record mode
Loop recording consists of choosing a start and end point on a track and
having this section play over and over again while you record and rerecord.
Each time the loop runs, it creates a new audio region. That way, you can
record a difficult section of a song as many times as you want and still have
all the takes available for review later on. To enable Loop Record mode,
chose Options➪Loop Record or Control-click (Mac) or right-click (PC) the
Record button in the Transport window until the Loop Record icon appears
in the record button. (Refer to Figure 3-1.)

Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Recognizing Record Modes
291
To create a loop to record to, follow these steps:
1. Enter the start point for your loop in the Start field of the Transport
window.
The Transport window runs along the top of the Edit window. Its (many)
features are discussed in detail in Book II, Chapter 4.
2. Enter the end point for your loop in the End field in the Transport
window.
3. (Optional) If you want a pre-roll, enter an amount of time for it to run,
using the Pre-Roll field of the Transport window.
A pre-roll, by the way, is a section of your song before where you actually
start recording that plays when you hit the Record button. A pre-roll
happens only before the first time through the loop. After that, the loop
runs the same way each time through: from start point to end point and
then back to the start point.
To find out how to review a bunch of audio regions you recorded using loops,
check out the section on auditioning takes in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.
QuickPunch Record mode
QuickPunch Record mode is great for manually adding a corrected musical
phrase on the fly — punching in (starting to record) and punching out (stopping
the recording process) onto record-enabled tracks while the song plays. Of
course, you can punch in and out in Destructive and Non-Destructive modes
(by selecting start and end points), but QuickPunch is designed for use on the
fly: You can punch in and out up to 100 times during each pass of the song. To
select QuickPunch Record mode, choose it from the Options menu (choose
Options➪QuickPunch from the main menu) or Control-click (Mac) or right-click
(PC) the Record button in the Transport window until the QuickPunch icon (a
little P, refer to Figure 3-1) appears on the Record button.
Using QuickPunch also ensures that you can constantly hear the audio while
the punch in and punch out happen, seamlessly switching between monitoring
the already-recorded track and monitoring the input source for the track
being punched.
By default, Pro Tools switches automatically from the recorded material to
the fresh input when the punch is enabled, and then back again when the
punch is disabled. If you don’t want this feature and prefer hearing your
input source before and after the punch (as well as during the punch), choose
Track➪Input Only Monitoring from the main menu. (This is detailed in the
“Monitoring Your Tracks” section, later in this chapter.)

Dealing with Disk Allocation
292
Dealing with Disk Allocation
Recording and playing back audio tracks is a hard drive-intensive process. To
make this process as smooth as possible, set up your hard drive for the best
possible (optimized) disk allocation to specify where your tracks get stored.
Basically, optimizing in this context means to limit how much hard drive
space is used for recording audio or to record to more than one hard drive. I
cover both options in the following sections.
Allocating hard drive space
How fast you can write to or read from a hard drive depends on where the
data is on the disk; if it’s all over the place, the hard drive has to hunt for it,
which means the data takes longer to read. To minimize any jumping around
the hard drive has to do to find the data, you can tell Pro Tools to put your
recorded audio on only a limited portion of the disk. This process — disk
allocation — speeds up access time. (You’ll find that certain types of hard-drive
formats, such as HFS+, and NTFS, are especially prone to slow-pokiness and can
benefit from this “marking off” of available disk space.)
To allocate your hard drive space, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box duly appears.
2. Click the Operation tab at the top of the Preferences dialog box.
The Preferences dialog box puts on its Operation face.
3. In the Open Ended Record Allocation section, choose the Limit To
radio button.
4. In the Limit To text field, type in a time slightly longer than the
longest song you usually record.
This limits the maximum file size so that Pro Tools places it within cer-
tain boundaries on the hard drive, thus reducing the real estate that
must be traveled for each file.
If you expect that you might end up with a really long song, select the Use All
Available Space radio button, or choose a really high number (say, 60 minutes)
for your limit. That way, your recording won’t stop before you want it to.
Using multiple hard drives for audio
One way to increase your ability to record and play back more tracks is to
have more than one hard drive dedicated to audio. Yup, this means having
three hard drives in your computer: one for the system files and applications,
and two for audio.

Book III
Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Enabling Recording
293
To allocate a specific hard drive on which to record a track, choose Setup➪
Disk Allocation from the main menu to open the Disk Allocation dialog box
(as shown in Figure 3-2). From this dialog box, you can manually choose the
hard drive that each audio track is recorded to by clicking and holding the
track name (a drop-down menu opens) and selecting one of the drives from
the list. All the drives in your computer will show up in this list. Or, you can
select the Use Round Robin Allocation for New Tracks check box, in which
case, Pro Tools distributes the tracks serially to more than one hard drive. All
your files are placed in a folder created for the session by Pro Tools.
To designate a different folder to record your tracks to, check the Custom
Allocation Options check box and then click the Change button. Select the
folder from the dialog box that appears.
If you want to record audio to the system drive, bear in mind that audio
takes up a big honkin’ lot of space, which could compromise system
performance. Choose the system drive to record only if you have no other
options: Say, you have only one hard drive in your system, or all your other
drives are full.
Enabling Recording
When you enable recording for a track, you’re ready to go. But before you
click that ol’ Record Enable button, check out what I have to say about the
ins and outs of enabling recording, using Latch mode, and running Record
Safe mode. Doing so might help you avoid some common pitfalls.
Record-enabling
Enabling a track for recording (the audio buzzwords are record-enabling) is
easy: Just click the Record Enable button for that track in the Edit or the Mix
Figure 3-2:
The Disk
Allocation
dialog box

where your

Enabling Recording
294
window (see Figure 3-3). The track will stay in Record mode until you either
click another track’s Record Enable button or you toggle out of Record mode
(by clicking the track’s Record Enable button one more time).
You can keep a track in Record mode when you move on and enable other
tracks. To do so, just engage the Latch mode (see the next section) or hold
down the Shift key while you select your other track(s).
Aside from simply clicking the Record Enable button, you are free to use
keyboard shortcuts to enable all tracks or selected tracks. These are done
the following ways:
✦To record-enable all tracks: Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC) the
Record Enable button of any track.
✦To record-enable selected tracks: Shift-click each track to select multi-
ple tracks and then Shift+Option-click (Mac) or Shift+Alt-click (PC) the
Record Enable button on one of the selected tracks. You can select
grouped tracks to enable by highlighting the group in the Edit Groups
list (located in the lower left of the Edit window) and then Shift+Option-
clicking (Mac) or Shift+Alt-clicking (PC) a Record Enable button on one
of the tracks in the group.
This step is a timesaver only if you already have some tracks selected
and you want to record-enable them. If your tracks aren’t already selected,
Shift-clicking the Record Enable button on each track is much faster.
After you have one or more tracks enabled for recording, you can click
Record and then Play to start recording. (Chapter 4 of this mini-book has
more on the intricacies of recording.)

Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Enabling Recording
295
Using Latch Record Enable mode
With Pro Tools, you have the option of latching — or unlatching — your
Record Enable buttons. In Latch Record Enable mode, you basically “lock”
down record-enabling so that when you enable recording on one track and
then move to enable recording on another track, the first track stays in Record
Enable mode. This allows you to consecutively enable more than one track.
With Latch Record Enable mode off, when you enable one track and then go
to enable another track, the first track turns off and is no longer record-
enabled.
Now that that’s straight, here’s how you actually turn Latch Record Enable
mode on and off:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
2. From the Preferences dialog box that appears, click the Operation tab.
The Operation view of the Preferences dialog box appears.
3. Select the Latch Record Enable Buttons check box to turn it on.
This check box is located in the upper right of the window, as shown in
Figure 3-4.

296
Running Record Safe mode
Record Safe mode does for your tracks what Write Protect features do for a
floppy disk or a Zip disk: namely, make it impossible for you to record-enable
a track. This is a truly helpful feature that has saved me from accidentally
recording over an already great track. To put a track into Record Safe mode,
Ô-click (Mac) or Ctrl-click (PC) the track’s Record Enable button. (Remember:
You can find the Record Enable button in the Edit window or the Mix window;
refer to Figure 3-3.) If you clicked correctly, the Record Enable button will gray
out, as shown in Figure 3-5. To reverse this procedure, Ô-click (Mac) or Ctrl-
click (PC) the button again.
If you want, you can put more than one track at a time in Record Safe mode.
Here’s how:
✦Placing selected tracks in Record Safe mode: Ô+Option+Shift-click
(Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+Shift-click (PC) the Record Enable button for one of
the selected tracks. This step assumes that you have tracks already
selected; Shift-click the track names in the Edit or the Mix window to
select them. If the tracks aren’t already selected, Ô-clicking (Mac) or
Ctrl-clicking (PC) the track’s Record Enable button for each track is
much quicker.
✦Placing all tracks in Record Safe mode: Ô+Option-click (Mac) or
Ctrl+Alt-click (PC) the Record Enable button on any track.
To toggle either selection off, just repeat whatever click combination you
used to get the multiple tracks selected in the first place.
Setting Levels
One of the most important parts of getting good recordings is to get your
recording levels just right. Too low, and your instrument sounds thin or
weak; too much level and you risk clipping (distorting) the signal.

In order to get a signal into Pro Tools, you need to
✦Record-enable a track.
✦Have the Input selector set to the hardware input your instrument or
microphone is plugged in to.
Book II, Chapter 3 has more on inputs in general and Input selectors in
particular.
After you do this, you can set the recording level in Pro Tools by
✦Using the preamp trim knob in your Digidesign interface: The 003, 003
Rack, 002, and 002 Rack have four preamps, and Mboxes have two preamps.
You can plug your microphone or your electric guitar or bass directly into
the input and adjust the trim knob until you get a good signal showing in
the track’s level meter. (Good here means peaks that don’t rise above the
yellow. See the “What’s a good level to record at?” sidebar.)
Condenser mics need phantom power to function. You can turn on phantom
power to the channels with preamps by engaging the switch on the back
panel of the interface.
✦Using the Line In inputs in your interface and adjusting the output
level of your instrument via the instrument’s volume control: If you
use Line In inputs, your instrument needs to be at line level. This means
that you can plug your synthesizer directly into these inputs. However, if
you want to use a microphone or an electric guitar or bass, you need to
boost the signal beforehand.
For microphones, this involves using an external preamp and plugging
your mic into the preamp and the preamp into your Digidesign interface.
For an electric guitar or bass, you need a direct box (or a preamp with a
direct box connection). You place this device between your guitar’s
output and the Digidesign input. Make adjustments to your signal level
at this device, using the device’s gain control.
The Volume fader for the track has no control over the Input level. It controls
only the playback and monitoring level. If you want to adjust the Input level,
you need to make the adjustments on your interface or preamp. (Check your
owner’s manual if you’re not sure how to do this.)
Adjust the level of your input until you get a reading of the highest notes
somewhere in the middle of the yellow range in the track’s level meter.

Setting a Record Range
298
Setting a Record Range
When you record in Pro Tools, you can start and stop your session while you
record, or you can set a recording range so the Pro Tools starts and stops
the recording process for you. This can be useful if you have your hands full
with instruments and you don’t want to take the chance that you’ll miss your
desired start or stop point by doing it by hand.
You can set the recording range by using one of these methods:
✦Type a start and end time into the Start and End fields of the
Transport window. For a detailed look at the Transport window, check
out Book II, Chapter 4.
✦Select a range in the ruler or in a track’s playlist.
• The ruler method: Simply adjust the two blue arrows along the timeline
until you have the Beginning arrow and the End arrow where you want
them.
• The track playlist method: This is when you set beginning and end
times by dragging across the record range with the Selector tool.
What’s a good level to record at?
Professional recording engineers debate as to
what’s the best level to record at in a digital
recorder (such as Pro Tools). Some say you
should get as high of a level as possible to take
full advantage of the dynamic range that digital
recording offers. Others say that it’s better to
record a little lower so you don’t overload the
summing bus of the software when it comes
time to mix. According to this theory, doing so
prevents unintentional clipping (distortion, in
other words) from extreme transients (the ini-
tial attack of the instrument) when recording.
So, which way should you go?
Well, because I record a lot of instruments with
fast, extreme transients (such as drums), I fall
into the “record lower to be safe” category.
Typically I go for a level around –12 decibels
(dB), with peaks no higher than –6dB. (If you
follow my lead here, your level meter should
read in the low- to middle-yellow range.) This
gives me a good signal that has plenty of
dynamic range but still leaves some headroom
(room for more signal before clipping) to work
with. It also minimizes any possibility of
extreme transients ruining the take.
I’m going to recommend, then, that you keep
your maximum levels squarely in the low to
middle of the yellow range in the track’s level
meter, regardless of the type of instrument you
want to record. If you follow my advice, you’ll
definitely thank me when you start to mix all
your tracks together. (Check out Book VI for
more on mixing.)

Book III
Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Monitoring Your Tracks
299
Note: You must have the Link Edit and Timeline Selections turned on.
This is done either by choosing Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selections
from the main menu or by clicking the Link button in the Edit window. (The
Link button, as shown here in the margin, is on the long, black toolbar right
above the timeline in the Edit window. Book II, Chapter 4 tells you more
about it.) To turn Link Edit and Timeline Selections off again, click the Link
button again or choose Link Edit and Timeline Selections from the Options
menu.
Of course, if you don’t want to preset the recording range — letting the clips
fall where they may, as it were — don’t select either of these options and just
let the playing start wherever it is and run to the end.
You can also set a pre-roll and post-roll time in the Transport window. You
use pre-roll and post-roll settings to designate an amount of time for the song
to play before (pre-roll) or after (post-roll) the actual recording happens. This
can help you get into the groove of the song before you need to start worrying
about how well you’re playing.
Monitoring Your Tracks
To record effectively, you need to hear what you’re doing. This is monitoring.
Managing your input monitoring in Pro Tools involves setting up your monitor
configuration and output and balancing between lowest latency (the delay
between input and output of the sound) and system performance. These
areas are detailed in this section.
Setting up monitoring
To set up your monitoring, you first need to choose the output of the tracks
you want to monitor so they match the main outputs on your system. Do
this by selecting the outputs in each track’s Output selector, located above
the Pan control in the Mix window. (Book II, Chapter 4 has more than you’d
ever need to know about Output selectors and Mix windows.)
Choosing a monitor mode
Pro Tools has two monitor modes: Auto Input monitoring and Input Only
Monitoring. (More on what these terms actually mean in a minute.) You can
select between these two options by checking or unchecking Track➪Input
Only Monitoring from the main menu. (See Figure 3-6.)

Monitoring Your Tracks
300
Auto Input Monitoring mode
In Auto Input Monitoring mode, you hear your previously recorded audio (if
any exists) on a record-enabled track right up until the point you start to record.
After recording has begun, you hear the input source while it’s being recorded.
After the recording is done, Pro Tools switches you back to hearing the previ-
ously recorded stuff. This is useful for doing punch recording, where you start
and stop recording while the session plays. This is the default setup for Pro
Tools and is active when you don’t have Input Only Monitoring checked in the
Track menu.
Input Only Monitoring mode
In Input Only Monitoring mode, you hear only the input source through your
monitors, regardless of whether other stuff is recorded on that track. When
this mode is enabled, the Record button in the Transport window is green.
When this mode is not enabled, the Record button is red. To enable this,
choose Track➪Input Only Monitoring.
Linking and unlinking Record and Playback faders
You have the option of “linking” the fader on your tracks when in Record
Enable or Playback mode (meaning that moving the fader in one mode moves
it the same distance in the other mode) or “unlinking” them (so you can
maintain separate fader levels in each mode). If you opt for the unlinking
option, Pro Tools remembers where your fader was set in both Record Enable
mode and Playback mode and returns the fader to its position when you
switch between these modes.
Unlinking your Record and Playback faders allows you to set the level differently
for playback and record. This can be useful for punch recording because you
can adjust both the recorded stuff and your input source independently and
have the same relative levels between your previously recorded track and
the input in the mix. Otherwise, your input source might be too loud or too
soft in comparison.

To link Record and Playback faders, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
2. Click the Operation tab at the top of the Preferences dialog box that
opens.
The Preferences dialog box presents you with its Operation face.
3. Select or clear the Link Record and Play Faders check box located in
the column on the right, as shown in Figure 3-7, depending which way
you want to work.
4. Click OK.
Adjusting monitoring latency
All digital systems have some latency — delay between the input of the audio
and its output. Latency used to be a big deal in computer-based systems
because to record more than a couple of tracks at once, you had to set your
system — usually by using a high H/W (hardware) buffer size — resulting in
painfully noticeable latency. This lag made it hard for many musicians to
record because they heard a distracting delay in their headphones while
they recorded.
Figure 3-7:
The Link
Record and
Play Fader
check box.

Monitoring Your Tracks
302
Nowadays, latency isn’t such a big deal because computers are often powerful
enough to be able to handle a lower buffer size while recording. You can lower
the buffer size in the Playback Engine dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-8. (To
access the Playback Engine dialog box, just choose Setup➪Playback Engine
from the main menu.) Depending on your Digidesign interface, you have the
choice between 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 samples. The lower the number, the
lower the latency.
For most recordings, you can get by with either 256-sample or 128-sample
settings. When recording at 44.1 kHz, this represents only about a 3- and a 
6-millisecond (ms) delay, respectively. This is equivalent to standing three or
six feet away from your instrument/amp/speaker. When mixing lots of tracks
with a bunch of plug-ins, you want to adjust this to a higher setting — such
as 512 or even 1024 — depending on the speed of your processor.
Using low-latency monitoring
If you want the least amount of latency possible and you don’t mind not
hearing reverb or other effects through your headphones, go for the low-
latency monitoring option: Just choose Options➪Low Latency Monitoring
from the main menu. (See Figure 3-9.)

produces.

303
Low-latency monitoring bypasses the internal mixer in Pro Tools and sends
the input’s sound back out without processing it. This reduces latency, but it
also limits what you can do. Here are some of the “strings attached” that
come with low-latency monitoring:
✦Low-latency monitoring applies only to outputs 1 and 2 on your hard-
ware. Any tracks set to another output can’t be monitored this way, so
you must choose outputs 1 and 2 as your outputs for the track you want
to monitor.
✦None of the plug-ins that you have routed to tracks 1 and 2 can be
heard in this mode.
✦Tracks set to record from an internal bus (a submix, for example)
can’t be monitored this way. You can use this mode only for tracks that
use a hardware input.
✦Tracks that you’re recording to won’t show up in the levels at the
Master Fader channel.
Creating a Click Track
A click track is basically a metronome that you can listen to while recording
to ensure that you stay in time with the session. Recording to a click track
can have many advantages, including being able to match the song’s sections
to particular bars or beats within the session. It also makes finding edit points
and performing certain edits much easier. I always spend a few minutes setting
up a click track for my songs, and I recommend that you give it try, too.

There are two ways to create a click track in Pro Tools: the easy way, and the
potentially better-sounding way (assuming you have an external device that
creates a nice sound, such as a drum machine). I cover both in case you
can’t stand the sound of the Click plug-in that’s created in the easy way.
Getting a click track the easy way
Starting with Pro Tools version 7.3, you can create a click track in your ses-
sion in just one step: Choose Track➪Create Click Track. This places a track
in your session with the click plug-in already inserted. Check out Figure 3-10.
The only other thing you may need to do to get this click going is to assign
an output to this track if you haven’t set your default output setting in the
I/O Setup dialog box (Book III, Chapter 2 covers this). To assign your output,
click and hold the Output selector for click track and drag to the physical
output you want for your click. This is usually the main outputs for your ses-
sion.
From here, you can follow the steps in the “Setting the tempo,” “Choosing
the meter,” and “Enabling a click track” sections later in this chapter.
Getting a click track the hard way
If you have an external drum machine or synthesizer, you may want to perform
a few extra steps so that the click you hear is something you want to hear
(the click plug-in that comes with Pro Tools is hard for many people to toler-
ate). This involves several steps that are outlined in the following sections.
Configuring your external device
To play a click track using an external device in Pro Tools, you need a desig-
nate a device for creating the sound. This can be an external MIDI sound
module (such as a drum machine or synthesizer).
Figure 3-10:

To configure the click-track device, follow these steps:
1. If you’re using an external MIDI device for your click, connect the
device to a MIDI port connected to your computer.
Some Digidesign and M-Audio interfaces come with MIDI ports, but others
don’t. If your interface has MIDI ports, you’re good to go. If it doesn’t,
however, you have to get a separate MIDI interface. (Book I, Chapter 4 can
get you up to speed on this.) As well, if you use the Click plug-in, you don’t
need to use your MIDI ports.
2. Double-click the Click button in the Transport window.
3. In the Click/Countoff Options dialog box that appears (see Figure 3-11),
open the Output drop-down menu to choose the device that will play
your click.
Be sure to choose the port and MIDI channel that your device is
connected to.
4. Select when you want the click to be played by selecting one of the
radio buttons at the top of the window.
You can select among During Play and Record, Only During Record, and
Only During Countoff.
5. Using the appropriate fields, enter the MIDI note, velocity, and dura-
tion for the accented and unaccented notes of the click.
6. (Optional) Select whether you want a countoff only during record and
then enter the number of bars you want in the Bars field.
Selecting the Only During Record check box means that there will be no
countoff when you play back the track. If you don’t want any countoff at
all, type in 0 in the Bars field.

Even with your device configured, you still won’t get any sound out of your
click track until you enable it in your session. The next section shows you
how to do this.
Connecting an external device to sound a click
Follow these steps to connect your external MIDI device to sound the click:
1. Connect the audio output of your external MIDI device to an audio
input of your Digidesign hardware.
2. Create a new mono audio track by choosing Track➪New from the
main menu or by pressing Ô+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (PC).
3. When the New Track dialog box opens, use the drop-down menus to
choose a single mono Audio track and then click Create.
Your track appears in the Edit and Mix windows and in the Audio
Regions list located at the right side of the Edit window.
Why mono? Well, it’s annoying to hear the clicking in only one ear. Mono
puts it in both ears, nice and clear.
4. Using the Input selector for your new track in the Edit or the Mix win-
dows, select the input that corresponds to the input your device is
connected to.
5. Set the output to the main stereo outputs of your session, using the
Output selector for your new track in the Edit or the Mix windows.
6. Record-enable the track by clicking the Record Enable button in the
Edit or the Mix windows.
Your click track plays according to your choice in the Click/Countoff
dialog box.
Setting the tempo
Whether you created your click track the hard or easy way, you still need to
set your session tempo to get the click to pulse at the tempo you want to
play to. Here’s how you do this:
1. Disengage the Tempo Ruler Enable button in the expanded Transport
window (choose View➪Transport➪Expanded).
The little Conductor guy turns grey. If it’s already grey, then leave it
alone.
2. Double-click in the tempo box in the expanded section of the
Transport window (as shown in Figure 3-12).
3. Type the tempo number you want and click Return/Enter.
Your tempo is set.

Book III
Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Creating a Click Track
307
Another way to change the tempo is to follow Step 1, and then click and drag
the slider located below the tempo setting left or right to get to the tempo
you want. Release your mouse when you set the tempo.
Choosing the meter
You also need to set the meter for the session. You do this using the 
Meter Change dialog box. You call up the dialog box by double-clicking 
the Meter button in the expanded Transport window (or choose View➪
Rulers➪Meter then click on the plus (+) sign next to the meter ruler bar).
The Meter Change the dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-13. The
Meter Change dialog box gives you the following parameters to adjust:
✦Snap to Bar: Select this check box to align any meter events with the
first beat in the nearest bar.
✦Location: The number you enter in this field determines the beginning of
the meter (time signature) event. For songs with only one time signature,
you enter 1/1/000 (bars/beats/ticks).
✦Meter: In these fields, type the meter that you want to use (4 in the top
field and 4 in the bottom field for common time, for example).
✦Click: From this menu, you choose the note value for the clicks played in
each measure. Choosing 1/4 note (a quarter note) gives you four clicks
in a 4/4 measure.

Enabling a click track
Even an electronic equivalent of a metronome has to be set in motion to do
any good. After you set up your click track to do its job, you have to enable
it so it will run while you’re recording.
You can enable your click track by
✦Choosing Options➪Click from the main menu
✦Clicking the Click button in the MIDI section of the Transport window
When Click is engaged, this button is blue.
You can engage the countoff by clicking the Countoff button in the MIDI
section of the Transport window. This button displays the number of
bars that the countoff is set for, and shows as blue when it’s engaged.
Setting up tempo and meter events
If your song has any tempo or meter changes, you can set up a map of these
changes (events). You might want to do this if you have complex songs with
several different time signatures or tempos. This makes sure that your click
track follows these changes so that you can stay in time, too. This section
shows you how.
Creating new tempo or meter events
Tempo and meter events are changes to your tempo or meter throughout the
song. You can make changes to the tempo or meter anywhere within the song,
and the placement of these events throughout the session constitutes the
tempo and meter maps. The easiest way to create new tempo or meter events
is to type in the location of the change of tempo or meter in the Location field
within the Tempo or Meter Change dialog boxes. You can also select your
locations by doing the following:
1. Click the Tempo or Meter ruler bar in the Edit window where you
want your tempo or meter change to happen.
Book II, Chapter 4 gives you all the details on both the Tempo and Meter
ruler bars.
2. Open the Tempo or Meter Change dialog box by clicking the appropri-
ate plus sign to the right of the label Tempo or Meter.
3. (Optional) In the Tempo or Meter Change dialog box, select the Snap
to Bar check box if you want the tempo or meter event to start at the
beginning of the nearest bar.
4. Type in the tempo or meter you want to use for that section.

Book III
Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Creating a Click Track

5. Click OK.
A triangle icon (green for tempo and yellow for meter) appears at the
location of this tempo or meter change.
You can use these steps to create more changes in tempo or meter (events)
anywhere within the session. When you create these events, Pro Tools
creates a map of them within your session with the little icons.
Editing tempo and meter events
When your tempo or meter events are in place, you can move, delete, copy,
or paste them. The following list tells you how:
✦Moving a tempo or meter event: You can move the location of tempo or
meter events easily by dragging the corresponding triangle along the ruler
to where you want it. Alternatively, you can double-click the triangle to
open the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box, where you can use the
Location field to set a specific location.
✦Deleting an event: To delete an event, Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click
(PC) over the triangle of the event you want to remove.
✦Copying an event: To copy a tempo or meter event, follow these steps:
a. Set the Edit mode to Grid and the grid resolution to 1 bar.
Doing so ensures that you select the beginning of a bar. (Book IV,
Chapter 1 details how to work with Edit modes and grid resolutions.)
b. Press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) and click and drag from the beginning to the
end of the event you want to copy.
You can select more than one contiguous event by continuing to 
drag across the events you want to select.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu or press Ô+C (Mac) or Ctrl+C
(PC) to copy the events.
✦Pasting an event: To paste an event that you’ve already copied, follow
these steps:
a. Click the place in the ruler bar where you want to paste the event(s).
b. Choose Edit➪Paste from the main menu or press Ô+V (Mac) or 
Ctrl+V (PC).

Chapter 4: Recording Audio
In This Chapter
 Recording a track
 Recording multiple tracks
 Playing back audio
 Recording additional tracks
R
ecording audio is what Pro Tools does best. (Well, that and editing it.
See Book IV.) This chapter guides you through recording single and
multiple tracks from analog and digital sources as well as playing back all
that stuff. In this chapter, you also discover the home recordist’s best way
to create full-blown songs: overdubbing, or adding tracks to those you already
recorded. I guarantee that you’ll use overdubbing a lot, so I spend a fair
amount of time getting you up to speed on the best (and easiest) ways to
overdub in Pro Tools.
Recording Tracks
Recording audio tracks in Pro Tools requires that you first choose your Record
mode, create a track, set levels, enable recording, and turn on a click track (if
you’re using one). These steps are all covered in detail in the previous chapter
in this mini-book, but you’ll also find a basic overview of these topics in this
section.
After you have all these steps taken care of, you’re ready to record some audio.
The following sections lead you through recording a single track or multiple
tracks, undoing or canceling takes, recording additional takes, auditioning
takes, and using playlists to organize and choose which takes to listen to.
Recording a single track
Most home recordists tend to record a single track at a time. (After all, most
human beings can play only one instrument at a time.) Recording to a single
track — whether mono or stereo — requires the following basic steps.
(Steps 1–6 are explained in detail in Chapter 3 in this mini-book.)
1. Open a session or create a new session.
2. Create a new audio track by choosing Track➪New.

Recording Tracks
312
3. Assign an input and output to your new track from the Input and
Output drop-down menus, found in the Controls section of the track.
4. Record-enable the track.
5. Set your recording level.
Be sure that your monitor speakers are turned off or all the way down if
you’re recording in the same room as your monitors because the micro-
phone might create feedback (an obnoxious hum or squeal) if it’s too
close to your speakers. My advice: When recording, use headphones to
monitor your playing.
6. Enable the click track and pre-roll (if you’re using those features).
7. Click the Return to Zero button in the Basic Controls section of the
Transport window, as shown in Figure 4-1.
This ensures that you start recording at the beginning of the session.
8. Click the Record button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window, as shown in Figure 4-1.
The Record button blinks red.
Clicking Record doesn’t actually start the recording process; it only gets
Pro Tools ready for recording.
To record by using keyboard shortcuts for Step 8, you can use any of the
following methods:
• Press Ô+spacebar (Mac) or Ctrl+spacebar (PC).
• Press the numberpad 3 key — that is, if you’ve set your system so your
Numeric Keyboard mode is linked to Transport. (Linking your numeric
keyboard to Transport is easy; just choose Setup➪Preferences from
the main menu to access the Preferences dialog box, click the Operation
tab, and then select the Transport radio button in the Numeric
Keypad section.)

9. Click the Play button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window (refer to Figure 4-1).
Only after you click Play does Pro Tools actually start recording; the
Record button glows a nice red while recording (not that you’ll be
watching it as you play).
10. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button in the Basic
Controls section of the Transport window or press the spacebar on
your keyboard.
This take appears in the Audio Regions list as a new region.
The Audio Regions list is on the right side of the Edit window. If this list
isn’t showing, click the double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the
Edit window.
Managing multiple tracks
Sometimes, you want to record more than one track at a time — say, when you
stereo-mic an instrument, when you record drums using several mics, or even
when you want to record a few musicians at a time. Recording multiple tracks
at one time follows much the same procedure as if you were recording a single
track: The only difference is that you use one of the following methods to
choose multiple tracks:
✦Select the Latch Record Enable Buttons option in the Operation tab of
the Preferences dialog box, and then click each track’s Record Enable
button. To call up the Preferences dialog box, choose Setup➪Preferences
from the main menu.
✦Record-enable noncontiguous tracks. Press and hold the Shift key while
you click each track’s Record Enable button.
✦Select all the tracks in your session. Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC)
the Record Enable button on any track.
✦Record-enable a selected track: Option+Shift-click (Mac) or Shift+Alt-
click (PC) the Record Enable button on the selected track.
Chapter 3 in this mini-book has more on these options.
Recording multiple tracks at once takes a toll on your system. A normal and
common symptom of this load is a delay between the time you click the Play
button and when the recording actually starts.

Recording Tracks
314
You can eliminate this delay by letting your system “warm up” first. This is
done by following these steps:
1. Click the Record button.
2. Press and hold Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while you click the Play
button.
The Record and Play buttons flash.
3. Click the Play button when you’re ready to record.
Pro Tools starts recording immediately, with no delay.
4. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button.
Using pre- and post-rolls
A pre-roll or post-roll is a designated amount of time that the session plays
before or after, respectively, the recording starts or stops. I’m a big fan of
pre- and post- rolls (well, at least pre-rolls). For example, setting a pre-roll for
two or three bars lets me get into the groove of a song before the recording
actually starts. You can set pre- and post-rolls several ways, as the following
sections make abundantly clear.
Using the Pre-Roll and Post-Roll fields in the Transport window
To set the pre- and post-roll values in the Transport window, do the following:
1. Choose View➪Transport➪Expanded from the main menu.
The Pre-Roll and Post-Roll fields appear beneath the basic transport
controls.
2. Click in the Pre-Roll Counter field in the Transport window and type
in the length you want, as shown in Figure 4-2.
This field displays in the same format as the main counter. In the case of
Figure 4-2, the format is bars and beats.
Figure 4-2:
Clicking the
Pre-Roll or
Post-Roll
field lets you
enter a
value for the
pre/post roll.

3. Press Return/Enter.
4. Click in the Post-Roll Counter field and type in your desired value.
This value, too, displays in the format selected for the main counter.
5. Press Return/Enter.
6. Click the Pre-Roll and/or Post-Roll button in the Transport window to
enable it.
The buttons are labeled Pre-roll and Post-roll and are to the left of the
counter fields used in Steps 2 and 4.
All enabled buttons are highlighted.
Using the Pre-Roll and Post-Roll flags in the ruler bar 
of the Edit window
The Pre- and Post-Roll flags are located along the Timebase ruler in the Edit
window. The flags are colored gray when they are disabled and green when
they are enabled. Follow these steps to set the pre-roll and post-roll amounts
using the flags in the ruler bar:
1. Press Ô+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (PC) or choose Options➪Pre/Post-Roll from
the main menu to enable Pre-Roll and Post-Roll flags on the ruler of
the Edit window.
The flags turn green to alert you that the pre- and post-roll functions are
enabled.
2. If you want the flag to snap to the grid, click the Grid button in the
upper-left of the Edit window to select the Grid Edit mode. Otherwise,
use any other Edit mode.
3. Click and drag the Pre- and Post-Roll flags on the ruler to where you
want them.
If you want the same value for both the pre- and post-rolls, you can press
Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while you drag one of the flags. The other flag follows
along while you move one.
Setting pre-rolls and post-rolls within a track’s playlist
Playlists are the regions contained in a track and are located in the middle of the
Edit window to the right of the track controls. Playlists most often display 
the waveform for the audio in the regions but can be set to display other things,

Playing Back Your Tracks
316
such as automation views. In addition to all the other neat things you can do
with a playlist, you can also enable and disable pre- and post-rolls. Just do the
following:
1. Choose Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main menu.
2. Click the Selector tool and drag along your track where you want the
recording to start and stop.
This selects your record range.
3. Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC) the track’s playlist where you want
to put the pre-roll.
This both turns on the pre-roll and sets its location, as shown in Figure 4-3.
4. Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC) the track’s playlist where you want
to put the post-roll.
This both turns on the post-roll and sets its location.
To turn off the pre-roll from within a track’s playlist, Option-click (Mac) or
Alt-click (PC) near the start point of the record range selected. To turn off
the post-roll, Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC) near the end point of the
record range selected.
Playing Back Your Tracks
After you record a track, you’ll most likely want to listen to it to make sure
that it sounds how you want. Pro Tools offers you many ways to play back a
track. In the following sections, I guide you through a few of the many
options for playing back audio regions.
Playing recorded tracks
After you record a track and click the Stop button, you can hear the track by
turning off the Record Enable button (click it to make the light disappear, as
shown at left in Figure 4-4) and then clicking the Play button (shown at right
in Figure 4-4). You can adjust the volume by moving the channel’s fader up
and down.
Figure 4-3:
Setting the
pre-or post-
roll flag.

Book III
Chapter 3
Recording Audio
Playing Back Your Tracks
317
If you use the Auto Input Monitoring option from the Track menu, you don’t
need to disable the Record Enable button. All you have to do is return to the
beginning of the session (press the Return to Zero button in the Transport
window) and then click the Play button in Basic Controls section of the
Transport window. Pro Tools automatically switches to play back the recorded
track. When you click Record and then click Play to record another take, Pro
Tools switches your monitoring back to the input.
Before you play back a track, make sure that the fader is turned down most
of the way because too-high volume can ruin your ears or speakers. You can
slowly bring it up as the session plays to get the volume you want.
If you have Link Edit and Timeline Selection selected under the Options
menu, you can play back your recorded track from anywhere in the session
by clicking the Timebase ruler where you want to start — using the Selector
tool in the Edit window — and then clicking Play. You can also use the Rewind
and Fast Forward buttons to move through the session, but this tip makes
getting around much faster and easier.
Setting scrolling options
Pro Tools lets you decide how you want the track material and Timebase
ruler data to move (scroll) in Edit window as a session is playing or recording.
You can choose between the following by choosing Options➪Scrolling, and
then choosing an option, as shown in Figure 4-5.
✦No Scrolling: With this option selected, the Edit window remains where
it is as the session plays. You can still move through the session by sliding
the scroll bar at the bottom of the window while the session plays.
✦After Playback: Enabling the After Playback option keeps the Edit
window static while the session plays and immediately takes you to the
current location of the song after the session stops.
Figure 4-4:

Playing Back Your Tracks

✦Page: Page scrolling during playback keeps the cursor visible at all times
as the session plays. When the cursor moves from left to right, the
window moves right.
This is the option I generally choose because I can easily keep track of
where I am in the session at all times.
Listening to playback loops
If you want to hear a specific section of a session over and over — to find
unidentifiable sounds, for example — you can create a playback loop. You
set this up by choosing Options➪Loop Playback from the main menu, as
shown in Figure 4-6. Or, you can press Shift+Ô+L or Control-click the Play
button (Mac), or press Ctrl+Shift+L or right-click the Play button (PC).
Next, set the start and end point of the loop. You have several ways to desig-
nate the start and end points, including
✦Using the Start and End fields in the Expanded section of the
Transport window: Click in the Start and End fields and type in the Start
and End points of your loop.
✦Selecting a range in the track’s playlist or Timebase ruler (the timeline
near the top of the Edit window): Make sure that you have the Link Edit
and Timeline Selection option selected in the Options menu. Then, using
the Selector tool, choose the range you want to loop, either in a track or
along the Timebase ruler, by dragging the Selector from the Start to End
point.
Figure 4-5:
You can set
the Edit
window to

Book III
Chapter 3

319
✦Dragging the playback markers in the Timebase ruler (timeline): With
the Selector tool, click and drag the playback markers (also called Start
and End Point markers). These are the blue arrows — or red if you have
any tracks record-enabled — at the beginning and end points of your
loop. You can move the markers either together or individually.
✦Using memory locators: Memory locators are user-assigned markers in
the song. (This option is covered in detail in Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Click the Play button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport window
to listen to the loop.
Using the Scrub feature
The Scrub feature in Pro Tools — located in the Edit window — works just like
rocking the tape back and forth against the playback head of a reel-to-reel tape
machine. (A what?) Um, okay. If you don’t recall that bit of 20th-century tech-
nology, just trust me: Scrubbing was a way of listening to tiny snippets of a
recorded track by moving the tape only a little. You can listen to a track by
moving the cursor back and forth across the spot you want to hear. You can
hear it forward or backward (in case you want to check the secret backward
message . . . just kidding). This is useful when finding a specific note in the
track — the hit of a snare drum, for instance. One of the great things about the
Pro Tools Scrub feature (compared with other recording programs) is that you
can scrub at any speed by simply moving the cursor at different speeds.
Figure 4-6:

Playback of
the Options
menu to

Doing Additional Takes
320
To scrub a track, follow these steps:
1. Click the Scrubber button from the top of the Edit window, as shown
in Figure 4-7.
The Scrubber button looks like a mini-speaker emitting sound.
2. Click and drag over the waveform in a track to hear it played.
You can scrub two adjacent tracks at once by dragging the Scrubber at the
boundary between the two tracks.
Doing Additional Takes
Chances are that your first attempt at recording a track wasn’t as good as you’d
like. No problem. You can just do another take. This process is the same as
recording your first one, but Pro Tools offers some options that can make it easy
and fun to get the “perfect” performance. These include loop recording, punch-
ing in and out, and sometimes (if you’re really on the fly) using the Pro Tools
QuickPunch feature. Of course, you can always just record the whole thing over
again if you want. All these options are covered in the following sections.
Starting over from scratch
Sometimes the best way to get it right is to start over. To record another take of
the entire session, click the Return to Zero button in the Basic Controls section
of the Transport window to return to the beginning of the session. Then follow
the steps in the “Recording a single track” section, earlier in this chapter.
If you record in Destructive mode, any additional takes that you record onto
a track will erase the previous one. So, if you want to make sure that you have
a take for later, first make sure you’re not using Destructive mode when you
record over any existing takes on a track. Or you can create a new playlist for
that track before you record your next take. (See the “Recording to playlists”
section, later in this chapter, for more on how to do that.)

Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and want to record over only part of it,
you can set points to start and stop this “recording over” within the session.
This is punching in and out.
Punching in to or out of a track involves (first) setting a start point and an
end point. You can do that in one of several ways, as I detail in the next few
sections.
Before you create your start and end points for a punch, you need to decide
where these points are going to be. To make this decision, you most likely
need to play the track back so you can hear where you want to punch. If
you’re not sure how to do this, the “Playing Back Your Tracks” section ear-
lier in this chapter gives you the details on this process.
Using the Start/End fields in the Transport
To set the start and end points in the Transport window, follow these steps:
1. Select the Expanded view option of the Transport window by choos-
ing View➪Transport➪Expanded from the main menu.
2. Click in the Start field in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window and type in the beginning of the punch section you want.
This field appears in the same format as the main counter. In the case of
Figure 4-8, it shows bars and beats.
3. Press Return/Enter.
4. Click in the End field and type in the end of the range.
This field, too, appears in the format selected for the main counter (as in
Figure 4-8).
5. Press Return/Enter.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. Check out the “Performing the
punch” section, later in this chapter, for steps on how to actually perform
the punch.

Selecting a section of a track’s playlist
The playlist section of the Edit window contains all the regions for the track.
You can make a selection within this playlist by following these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main
menu.
This ensures that when you make your selection in a track’s playlist, the
start and end point markers in the Timebase ruler follow along.
2. With the Selector tool, click and drag over the section in your track
you want to record over, as shown in Figure 4-9.
This highlights the selection and positions the start point at the beginning
of your selection and the end point at the end.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. Go to the “Performing the punch”
section later in this chapter for steps on how to actually perform the punch.
Dragging the Start and End Point markers along the ruler bar
The Start and End Point markers are located along the Timebase ruler in the
Edit window and appear as up and down arrows — up for punch out, and
down for punch in. The flags are colored blue when no tracks are record-
enabled and red when one or more tracks are record-enabled. Setting Start
and End Point markers in the Ruler bar consists of these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main menu.
This makes sure that when you drag the markers along the ruler bar, the
corresponding section in the track’s playlist are selected as well.
2. If you want the markers to snap to the grid, click the Grid button in the
upper-left of the Edit window to select the Grid Edit mode; otherwise,
use any other Edit mode.

3. With the Selector tool, click and drag the Start and End Point arrows
to where you want them, as shown in Figure 4-10.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. The following section lays out steps
on how to actually perform the punch.
If you want to select the entire length of the session, double-click one of the
arrows.
Performing the punch
After you set the start and end points for your punch (whether in or out),
you can record to that section by doing the following:
1. Set and enable a pre-roll by clicking in the Pre-Roll field in the
expanded Transport window (choose View➪Transport➪Expanded to
get there) and typing in the amount of pre-roll you want.
After you do this, you can hear the previously recorded track before the
punch-in happens.
2. Set and enable a post-roll by clicking in the Post-Roll field in the
expanded Transport window (choose View➪Transport➪Expanded to
get there) and typing in the amount you want for your post-roll.
Doing so lets you hear how your punch fits in with the previously
recorded track.
3. Choose Non-Destructive or Destructive Record mode.
• Non-Destructive Record mode is the default mode and is active if you
have a Record button without any icon in it.
• With Destructive Record mode selected, a small D is visible in the
center of the Record button in the Transport window. Select
Destructive Record mode by choosing Options➪Destructive Record
from the main menu.
Use Destructive Record mode only if you’re really sure you don’t want
to keep the previous take in the selected section.

4. Click the Record Enable button for the track you want to record onto.
The button blinks red.
5. Click the Record button.
The Record light flashes red.
6. Click the Play button when you’re ready to record.
The session starts at the pre-roll time, the Record button flashes red,
and you hear the previously recorded track until the pre-roll is over. The
monitoring switches to the input source, and the Record light stops
flashing but remains red.
When you hit the end of the recording range, the session stops playing, or —
if you have the post-roll enabled — stops recording. At that point, the
Record button starts flashing again, and the monitoring switches back to the
recorded region until the end of the post-roll period. When the session
reaches that point, it stops playing.
Loop recording
Loop recording lets you choose a section of the song to repeatedly record again.
This makes it easy to try a bunch of takes without having to manually start and
stop each time through the section. Loop recording can be done a bunch of
ways. I describe one in Chapter 3 in this mini-book, but here’s another:
1. Choose Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main menu.
This ensures that when you make a selection in either the Timebase
ruler or within a track’s playlist, both are selected.
2. Click the Selector tool at the top of the Edit window to select it.
3. With the Selector tool, click and drag across the section of the track
that you want to record over.
4. Record-enable the track by clicking the Record Enable button in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window.
5. Select the Loop record mode by choosing Options➪Loop Record,
pressing Option+L (Mac) or Alt+L (PC), or by Control-clicking (Mac) or
right-clicking (PC) the Record button in the Basic Controls section of
the Transport window until the Loop Record icon shows up.
6. Click the Record button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window to prepare the session to record.
7. Click Play in the Basic Controls section of the Transport window to
start recording.

If you designated a pre-roll, it will happen only before the first time through
the loop. After that, the loop goes from start point to end point, back to start
points, and so on.
Using QuickPunch
If you have sections that you want to replace in a track (say, a bunch of
guitar counter points to support the lead vocal) and you want to record the
new parts in just one pass of the session, you can use QuickPunch mode.
Setting up for QuickPunch requires these steps:
1. Click the Return to Zero button in Basic Controls section of the
Transport window to return to the beginning of the session.
2. Record-enable the track(s) you want to fix by clicking the Record Enable
button for each track in the Track Controls section of the Edit window.
3. Set the Record mode to QuickPunch by choosing Options➪QuickPunch,
Control-clicking (Mac) or right-clicking (PC) the Record button, or
pressing Ô+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (PC).
The QuickPunch (P) icon appears in the Record button.
4. Click the Play button to start the session.
The Record button flashes while the session plays, and you hear the
previously recorded track in the monitors.
5. Click the Record button when you want to punch in.
The Record button stops flashing and recording starts immediately.
Monitoring switches from what’s recorded to what’s coming in; you hear
the input source.
6. Click the Record button again to stop recording.
The button begins flashing again, and monitoring switches back to the
recorded track.
You can repeat this procedure up to 100 times per session. (Probably
enough to fix that pesky track, eh?)
Overdubbing: Recording additional tracks
Overdubbing is adding tracks to those already recorded. This process is the
mainstay of the home recordist’s recording repertoire because it allows you
to play all (or as many as you want) of the instruments in your song. You can
start with the drum tracks, add some bass guitar, then some rhythm guitar,
and later the lead vocals, and so on.

Doing Additional Takes
326
Overdubbing is similar to recording your first track except that you have to
be able to hear the other tracks and synchronize to them while you play. The
main things to be concerned about when you overdub are
✦Creating a monitoring mix: Take some time to create a mix of the previ-
ously recorded tracks that you can hear as you record so you have a
blend that inspires you to perform your best. Depending on your
system, you might not be able to add any effects to your mix, but getting
the right balance between instruments can really help your recording.
(Check out Book VI for more on mixing.)
✦Getting into the groove: Make sure that you have the least amount of
latency in your system when overdubbing; otherwise, it can really mess
up the groove. Chapter 3 of this mini-book covers this in detail — and
it’s especially important for instruments with a fast attack and decay,
such as drums and percussion, because they sound awful when they’re
slightly out of time.
Because an Mbox is a USB interface, it has a noticeable latency no matter
what buffer setting you choose for your hardware. This latency can simply
be too much for some critical instruments, so Digidesign has implemented a
monitoring setup that lets you monitor the input of the Mbox while hearing
the output of your recorded tracks, which reduces the latency. To set up
your Mbox monitoring to record without hearing latency, follow these steps:
1. Click the Mute button located in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window to mute the track you’re overdubbing onto.
This keeps you from hearing the track as it comes back out of the
system.
2. Click the Mono switch on the Mbox.
This allows both the input and the recorded tracks to play through both
speakers. If this switch isn’t depressed, you hear the input in one ear only.
3. Adjust the Mix knob on the front of the Mbox to blend your input with
the tracks playing in the session.
You need to do this when the session is playing and you’re playing your
instrument at the same time so you can hear both the recorded tracks and
your input. Try a test run-through to get a balance before you actually
record.
After you record your overdubbed track, you need to move it to a position
that’s 164 samples earlier in the Edit window. These 164 samples are the
exact amount of time that it takes for the sound to go through the Mbox and
into Pro Tools. Follow these steps:

1. Click the Grabber tool (it looks like a small hand) at the top of the Edit
window.
Use this to “grab” the region you want to move.
2. Click and drag to highlight the overdubbed track.
3. Choose Edit➪Shift from the main menu or press Option+H (Mac) or
Alt+H (PC).
The Shift dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-11.
4. Select the Earlier radio button in the top and type 164 into the
Samples field at the bottom.
This moves your overdubbed material the exact amount of the latency
introduced by the Mbox when you recorded.
5. Click OK.
To make sure each overdubbed track lines up with the first track, you need
to shift each overdubbed track over immediately after you record it (or at least
before you record another overdub). This ensures that all the recorded tracks
you’re hearing are lined up with the first track when you record a new one.
Recording to playlists
Whenever you have material recorded to a track, it exists within the Edit
window as a playlist. This playlist contains all the regions (representations
of the actual audio on your hard drive) that are currently in a track. One of
the nice things about Pro Tools is that you can create a bunch of separate
playlists for a track and swap them in and out of the track. Whichever of a
track’s playlists is in the Timebase ruler section of the Edit window is the
one that is heard when your session is playing back.
Playlists are handy for keeping all your takes organized, and they also let
you record additional takes on a track even when you’re using Destructive
Record mode. You can create a new playlist by clicking the little arrows next
Figure 4-11:

to the track’s name in the Track Controls section of the Edit window. This
opens a drop-down menu for a track, as shown in Figure 4-12.
To record to this playlist, follow the steps in the “Recording a single track”
section, earlier in this chapter.
Auditioning takes
After you record a bunch of takes of a track, you can audition them to see
which one you prefer: from the Audio Regions list, from the Take List drop-
down menu, and from the track’s playlist. You can also set preferences for
viewing takes of a track, and you can audition takes from multiple tracks at
once. All these options are covered in this section.
Auditioning from the Audio Regions list
You can take regions from the Audio Regions list, located at the right side of
the Edit window (if this list isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-
right corner of the Edit window) and drag them directly into a track’s playlist
(the regions that represent the audio for a track), located to the right of the
Track Controls section of the Edit window.
1. Click the Grabber button in the Edit window to select the Grabber tool.
2. Click the current take in the track’s playlist, as shown in Figure 4-13.
The playlist in a track consists of all the regions that you can see in the
session.
3. Press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) and click another take in the Audio Regions
list.
The Audio Regions list is located on the right side of the Edit window. If
it’s not visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the

The region is placed in a track and is ready to play.
Auditioning from the Takes List drop-down menu
You can audition your takes by opening a drop-down menu that has a list of
all the takes for a punch or loop recording session. This option lets you freely
switch the takes while the session plays. This section outlines the procedures.
1. Click the Selector button in the Edit window to choose the Selector tool.
2. Select a take within a track’s playlist (the regions located to the right
of the track name) and Ô-click it (Mac) or Ctrl-click it (PC) to open the
Takes List drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 4-15.
You can also click the precise Start point of the punch or loop range in the
track’s playlist or along the Timebase ruler without first selecting the track.
3. Choose the take you want to hear from the Takes List drop-down menu.
This take replaces the previous one and is placed at its correct position
in the session.

You can follow the steps for both of these approaches if you want to audition
more takes.
From the Takes List drop-down menu, you can choose and change takes
even while the session is playing.
The different takes are listed in the order they were recorded. If you start
moving them around, though, you can identify them by the time stamp cre-
ated when you recorded the take.
Choosing from a track’s playlist
The track’s playlist contains the regions located in a track. The playlist is
located to the right of the Track Controls for each track and represents the
audio data for the track. To audition tracks from a track’s playlist, click in the
little arrows next to the track’s name in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window to open the playlist drop-down menu and then choose the playlist to
play, as shown in Figure 4-16. The name of the track changes to the name in
the chosen playlist.
Choosing your take’s preferences
You can use the “Matching Start Time” Takes List section of the Edit tab of
the Preferences dialog box (as shown in Figure 4-17) to choose which takes
get listed in the Takes List drop-down menu. (To access the Preferences
dialog box, choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.)

check box ensures that only takes from the same track are present.
✦Includes Take Region Lengths That Match: Selecting this option shows
only those takes that are the same length as the one presently in the
track.
✦“Separate Region” Operates on All Related Tracks: If you select this
check box, all takes with the same User Time Stamp are edited when you
use the Separate Region command for the track.
Auditioning takes from multiple tracks at one time
If you want to audition takes from multiple tracks at once — for example,
when recording drums to several tracks at a time — follow these steps:
1. Select both the Take Region Name(s) That Match Track Names and the
Take Regions Lengths That Match options in the “Matching Start

3. With the Selector tool, drag across all the tracks for the range you
want to replace, as shown in Figure 4-18.
4. Ô-click (Mac) or Ctrl-click (PC) one of the tracks within that selected
region.
The Takes List drop-down menu appears. Takes that match the preferences
set in Step 1 show up in the list.
5. Choose a region (take) from the list.
Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
If you have a take (recorded performance) that you don’t like, you can get rid
of it in one of several ways. You can cancel the take while you’re recording,
undo the take after you’ve recorded it, or clear the audio region from the
Audio Regions list. All these options are detailed in the following sections.
Canceling your performance
Canceling a performance is handy when you’re in the middle of recording
and you know you’re not going to keep the take. (For example, the mail arrived,
causing the dog to go ballistic in the middle of your vocal.) To cancel a
performance, simply press Ô+. (period; Mac) or Alt+. (period; PC). This stops
the session and clears the audio region created for this take with one stroke.
You can’t use this command if you record in Destructive Record mode.

Undoing your take
If you already stopped recording and you know that you don’t want to keep
your latest try, you can undo the take by choosing Edit➪Undo Record from the
main menu (as shown in Figure 4-19) or by pressing Ô+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (PC).
If you used QuickPunch mode, only the last punch will be undone. If you
used Loop Record mode, on the other hand, all the looped passes will be
undone. And if you used Destructive Record mode, your previous take will
have already been erased when you recorded — so undoing the last take will
leave you with nothing on that track.
Clearing the file from the Audio Regions list
After hearing a few of your takes, if you decide that you want to get rid of
one or more of them, you can clear the take(s) from the Audio Regions list.
The following steps show how:
1. Click the region you want to get rid of in the Audio Regions list to
highlight it.
To select more than one region to clear, press and hold the Shift key
while you click each region.

ard drive recording — in general, and with Pro Tools specifically —
makes editing audio fast and easy. In days of old, if you wanted to
remove a bad note or shoddy drum hit, you had to break out a razor blade
and some sticky tape, prepare the offending segment of magnetic tape for
surgery, hold your breath, and apply a steady hand. Any changes to the
recorded tracks got you into a messy, inexact, time-consuming process that
many engineers weren’t very good at. Even the steadiest hands couldn’t
come close to the accuracy and variety now available (to even the clumsiest
of the bunch) through the editing functions of the new digital gear.
This chapter gets you started on the process of editing audio in Pro Tools.
First, you get to know the basic ways that Pro Tools does editing — in
particular, the role of audio regions (representations of your audio files in
the Edit window). This chapter then guides you through finding and viewing
regions so making edits is quick and easy. You also discover the joys of using
playlists to work with these regions. And as if all that wasn’t enough, this
chapter also explains the four different edit modes available in Pro Tools.
Understanding Pro Tools Editing
Editing in Pro Tools on your computer is similar to working with any hard
drive recorder — and often, it’s much easier. Two things about editing in Pro
Tools make it fast, easy, and (from the viewpoint of your creative work) safe:
✦Unless you specify otherwise, it’s nondestructive: That is, you can
always undo your edit if you don’t like it.
✦You can perform most editing functions in Pro Tools while your session
is playing back.
I detail both of these features in the following sections.

Getting to Know Region Types
338
Nondestructive editing
Nondestructive editing does not change your original audio files when you
edit an audio region. Most editing functions in Pro Tools — clearing, cutting,
pasting, separating, and trimming your audio regions, for example — are
nondestructive. (All these operations are explained in Chapter 2 of this 
mini-book.)
Not all Pro Tool editing procedures are nondestructive. A few are destructive:
Using them will permanently alter your source audio file. Whenever I describe
one of these procedures, I’ll warn you (look for a Warning icon) that after
you perform the function, your source file will be changed.
Editing during playback
Most editing functions can be carried out while the session is playing. This
feature makes editing much faster and easier because you can instantly hear
(and see) what your changes have done. Some of these edits include
✦Capturing, separating, and trimming regions
✦Nudging, placing, rearranging, or spotting regions
✦Creating fades or crossfades in and between regions (version 6.0 and later)
✦Auditioning playlists
✦Editing automation data
✦Inserting RealTime plug-ins (version 6.0 and later)
✦Processing audio using AudioSuite plug-ins
You can find out more about these functions throughout this chapter and the
next three chapters (Chapters 2–4 in this mini-book).
Getting to Know Region Types
When you record a track, a new audio region is created in the track’s playlist
(the track displays you see next to the Track Controls section in the Edit
window). This region corresponds to an audio file of that performance,
which resides on your hard drive. When you perform edits to your recorded
performances, you do so by making changes to these regions.
Both edited and unedited regions appear on the Audio Regions list, the
handy list you find to the right of the track playlist. (If the Audio Regions list
isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the far bottom-right of the Edit window
to open it.) Several region types show up in the list, indicating the entire audio

Basics
Viewing Regions

file or a portion of it. You can choose Whole-File, User-Defined, Auto-Created,
Offline, and Stereo audio regions. The following list gives you details on each
region type:
✦Whole-File: Whole-file audio regions represent entire audio files recorded
to your hard drive. Displayed in bold letters in the Audio Regions list,
they’re created when you do one of four things:
• First record an audio track.
• Import an audio file from outside the session.
• Consolidate existing regions.
• Nondestructively process audio by using an AudioSuite plug-in.
✦User-Defined: User-defined regions are created when you do one of three
things:
• Rename an existing region.
• Capture, record, consolidate, or separate audio regions.
• Trim a whole-file region.
✦Auto-Created: These regions are automatically created when you edit a
region or punch-record over one. The more takes you record of your
tracks — and the more edits you do — the more these regions add up.
To keep your Audio Regions list from becoming cluttered, you can hide
your Auto-Created regions easily, or you can convert them into full-
fledged User-Defined regions by renaming them.
✦Offline: These regions can’t be linked to an audio file on your hard drive,
usually because Pro Tools can’t find the original file. In the Audio Regions
list, the names of these regions are displayed in dimmed italics; in the
track’s playlist, they show up in blue italics. You can generally edit these
regions like you would any other region except that you can’t process
them by using AudioSuite plug-ins.
✦Stereo: These audio regions are associated with a stereo file. If you click
the triangle to the left of the region name, you can see the two mono
channels (one for each side) listed. These individual channels can be
dragged onto separate tracks, if you choose.
Viewing Regions
You can customize how you view audio regions a number of ways in Pro Tools:
Select the track view, change the track height, assign name and time locations,
or zoom in and out. These options get a closer look in the following sections.

Viewing Regions
340
Selecting the track view
By default, audio tracks in the Edit window are set to Waveform view. This
view shows a visual representation of the sound produced by the audio file
associated with a particular region. Pro Tools also gives you the option of
ditching the Waveform view and going with something different. You switch
between different views with the help of the Track View menu, as shown in
Figure 1-1, which you access by clicking and holding the Track View display
in the Track Controls section of the Edit window.
Your options are as follows:
✦Block: Block view shows a blank box for each audio region. This view
makes screen redraws much quicker, which is useful during mixing when
all the editing is done and you don’t need to see the waveform.
✦Waveform: Waveform view is the default — a graphical representation of
the audio file, much like what you’d see if you ran a sound through an
oscilloscope. This is the best view to be in when you’re editing regions
because you can easily find the start of a note. After a while, you’ll proba-
bly be able to almost hear the track by looking at the waveform.
Besides being able to see waveforms in their normal way — with both
positive and negative values — you can choose the Draw Waveforms
Rectified option, which displays the waveform as a summed value of the
positive and negative level. This can be useful when you want to create
volume automation to increase or reduce specific notes (such as, respec-
tively, a weak or very loud drum hit). To get that rectified look, select the
Draw Waveforms Rectified check box on the Display tab of the Preferences
dialog box. (You know the drill: Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main
menu to get to the Preferences dialog box.)
✦Volume: This view shows the volume level of the track. The volume level
is displayed as a line superimposed over the waveform. In this view, the
region’s name is hidden.
Figure 1-1:

view of a
region in a

the Track
View menu.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Audio Editing
Basics
Viewing Regions
341
✦Mute: This view shows whether the track is muted. When a track is muted,
the line shows at the bottom of the view; when the track is unmuted, the
line shows at the top. If a track uses automatic muting, a vertical line
shows where the mute is turned on or off. This view also shows the
waveform in the background.
✦Pan: Pan view shows the apparent position of the track’s output from
left to right (pan) in the stereo sound. When the track is panned in the
center, the line is centered in the view. Far-left panning shows up at the
top; far-right is on the bottom. Settings in between these two extremes
correspond to the pan value. In this view, you can also see a waveform
display in the background.
You can toggle between Waveform and Volume views by highlighting the track
and pressing Control+– (minus/dash; Mac) or Windows+– (minus/dash; PC).
Adjusting the track height
Pro Tools lets you adjust your track heights. You can either choose from var-
ious track heights (Micro, Mini, Small, Medium, Large, Jumbo, Extreme, and
Fit to Window), or you can simply click and drag the lower boundary of your
track with your mouse to the height that you want. These choices allow you
to make tracks you’re not editing small, while the tracks you want to edit can
be made big enough so that you can really get in close to a waveform when
you edit. You choose your various track heights from the Track Height 
drop-down menu, which you can access from
✦The Track Height Selector button in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window: Click and hold with the mouse pointer over the button (it
looks like a >) to make the Track Height drop-down menu appear, as
shown in Figure 1-2. Choose the size you want.
✦The far-right edge of the Track Controls section: Choose the track height
you want by clicking and holding with the mouse pointer over the little
ruler at the far side of the Track Controls section (as in Figure 1-3) and
selecting an option from the Track Height drop-down menu that appears.

Viewing Regions

For stereo tracks, you can choose an expanded view that allows you to view
each channel separately. If you edit the channels individually and they end up
being different lengths, these stereo tracks become two mono tracks instead.
Assigning region-name and time-location displays
Every audio region has a region name and time stamp attached to it. You can
choose whether this information shows up on the region displays in your tracks.
Displaying region names
You can choose to show or hide the name of the regions in the track displays
by choosing View➪Region➪Name, as shown in Figure 1-4. (Choose View➪
Region➪Name again to uncheck the option.)
Choosing region time stamps
You can choose any of several time stamp views by choosing View➪Region,
and then selecting a time stamp view: Current Time, Original Time Stamp (as
shown Figure 1-5), User Time Stamp, or No Time.

✦User Time Stamp: This option displays a time stamp that you can define.
By default, it shows the original time, but you can change it in the Time

can open by clicking the Audio Regions title bar at the top of the Audio
Regions list. Selecting the Time Stamp option opens the User Time Stamp
dialog box where you can enter the value you want, as shown in Figure 1-6.
✦No Time: This option hides the time stamp.
Zooming in and out
You can zoom in and out of all tracks by using the Zoom buttons at the top
of the Edit window (see Figure 1-7), or you can zoom in and out of a single
track by using the Zoom tool (see upcoming Figure 1-8). You can also zoom
in on the ruler and toggle the zoom back and forth between unzoomed and
zoomed. Being able to zoom way in to a region lets you make precise edits to
the waveform.

Zooming in on all tracks with the Zoom buttons
The Zoom buttons section of the Edit window has buttons that allow you to
zoom in and out both horizontally and vertically, as well as buttons for creating
zoom presets for levels that you use frequently. The following list gives you the
details on each feature:
✦Horizontal Zoom: The outer two Zoom buttons control how wide of a
portion of the timeline — and of all audio and MIDI tracks and regions —
that you can see onscreen. Clicking the left button gives you a narrower
view; clicking the right button gives you a wider view.
✦Vertical Zoom: To zoom in vertically on audio (left vertical zoom button)
or MIDI (right vertical zoom button) tracks, click the top or bottom part of
the button with the waveform icon (at the left of the window). Clicking the
top of the button increases the height of the display in the track’s view;
clicking the bottom decreases the height.
Increasing the vertical zoom might make the waveform too big to fit in the
track display. If this is the case, you can increase the track’s height as
described in the “Adjusting the track height” section, earlier in this chapter.
✦Zoom Presets: At the bottom of the Zoom buttons section are five presets
that work like the presets on a car radio. To assign a setting to a Preset
button, just get the Zoom setting you want — kind of like tuning a car radio
to the station you want — and then Ô-click (Mac) or Ctrl-click (PC) the
Preset button. Then repeat the steps for the other four preset buttons.
You can select a preset by
• Clicking the numbered Preset button you want in the Zoom buttons sec-
tion of the Edit window
• Pressing the number of the Preset button you want on your keyboard
while pressing Control (Mac) or Windows (PC)
• With Command Keyboard Focus (Commands Focus) enabled, pressing
the number of the Preset number you want on the number pad of your
keyboard
Enable Command Keyboard Focus by clicking the Command
Keyboard Focus button, as shown here in the margin.

Zooming in on a single track with the Zoom tool
Use the Zoom tool to select a specific spot in a track to zoom in and out of.
The Zoom tool has two modes: Normal and Single Zoom.
✦Normal Zoom mode: You can zoom in and out horizontally and verti-
cally on the waveform when using this mode.
• Zoom horizontally: First click the Zoom tool button, as shown here in
the margin, to select the Zoom tool. Then click and drag a section to
select it, as shown in Figure 1-8. Pro Tools zooms to that section. To
zoom in farther, click and drag again.
• Zoom vertically and horizontally: Press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) and then
click and drag the section, as shown in Figure 1-9. Pro Tools zooms
in. Repeat to zoom in farther.
To zoom out again, press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) key while you
click the zoomed area. Each click moves you out a little bit.
✦Single Zoom mode: If you’re in Single Zoom mode when you finish
zooming in on a spot, Pro Tools switches you back to the tool you were
using. For example, if you want to scrub a section of a track and need to
zoom in to get a more accurate start point, you can use the Single Zoom
mode of the Zoom tool to zoom in. After you’re zoomed in, you automati-
cally return to the Scrub tool.

You can select Single Zoom mode by:
• Clicking and holding the Zoom tool button (as shown here in the
margin) and selecting the Single Zoom option
• Clicking the Zoom tool button and pressing F5 on your keyboard to
toggle back and forth between Zoom tool modes
No matter which method you choose to select Single Zoom mode,
after you’re in this mode, the Zoom tool button changes its face to
look like what you see here in the margin.
Zooming in on the ruler
If you have a spot in your session (the start of the chorus, for example) that
you want to zoom into, you can use the ruler bar (where the location of your
session is displayed) to select your zoom location. This is done by Ô+Control-
clicking (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt-clicking (PC) over a section of the ruler to zoom in
one level. You can also drag over a section of the ruler while holding Ô and
Control (Mac) or Ctrl and Alt (PC).
Zooming with the Zoom Toggle command
The Zoom Toggle command takes a selection, increases the track’s height to
Large, and fills the window. This command makes zooming quick by using
just one keystroke. This is a great function to use when you edit parts and need
to get in really close to make an accurate edit, and then move out further to
find the next spot to edit. To use the Zoom Toggle command, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selector tool by clicking it at the top of the Edit window.
2. With the Selector tool, select a portion of one or more tracks.
3. Press Control+E (Mac) or Windows+E (PC).
The track height changes to the Large setting (see the “Adjusting the
track height” section, earlier in the chapter) and the selection fills the
space.
4. Repeat Step 3 to return to the previous view.
If you want to change the default height for the Toggle Zoom to something
other than Large, use the Zoom Toggle Track Height drop-down menu. (It’s
on the Editing tab of the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-10.)
Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu to call up the Preferences
dialog box, from which you can select any of the possible Track Height options.

Understanding Edit Modes
Pro Tools offers four basic edit modes; the mode you use depends on the task
you want to perform. You get a chance to dig pretty deep into these edit modes
in the next chapter, but here’s a basic overview of each of them. Figure 1-11
shows all four edit mode buttons — Shuffle, Spot, Slip, and Grid — all nicely
lined up on the toolbar — and coming right up is a list that gives you a taste of
what each mode can do for you.
✦Shuffle: Shuffle mode allows you to move a region around in an audio track,
automatically placing it at the end of the nearest region. This is a handy
way to move regions around if you want to experiment with alternate
arrangements of a song. For example, you can move the second bar of a
four-bar phrase to the last bar by grabbing it and sliding it over to the end.
The third bar moves to replace the second, and the second bar snaps right
to the end of the fourth. Presto! New arrangement!
✦Spot: In Spot mode, you can designate the exact timeline placement of a
region you want to move. Click to engage Spot mode, and then click a
region (which brings up the Spot dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-12).
Enter the place you want to move the region to in the appropriate field
and then click OK.

If you want to move the region back to its original place, you can click the
arrow to the right of the Original Time Stamp field in the Spot dialog box.
✦Slip: Use Slip mode to move regions anywhere you want within the
playlist. You can have regions overlap or leave space between them, for
instance. To move a region using Slip mode, click and hold over the
region and then drag it where you want.
✦Grid: Moving a region using Grid mode snaps the region to the predefined
time grid. Grid mode is useful if you want to quickly move a drum part
over a beat, for example. Starting with version 6.0, Grid mode gives you
two different options: Absolute and Relative. To choose one of these
modes, click and hold the Grid button and then choose the one you want.
Here’s what they offer you:
• Absolute Grid mode: When using Absolute Grid mode, if you move a
region that doesn’t begin where the grid resides — on the & of 1
when the grid is set to 1/4 notes, for example — the region will snap
to the resolution of the grid.
This isn’t a good mode to use if you have a region that starts on the &
of 1 (1/8 note after the downbeat) with a 1/4 note grid and you want
the region to fit in the measure the same way after moving it. Your
start point will move to a downbeat and all the rest of your notes will
be off by an eighth note.
• Relative Grid mode: In Relative Grid mode, you move regions by the
unit of the grid (1/4 notes, for example). So, in the example of a
region starting on the & of 1 with a grid resolution of 1/4 notes, the
region will move over by the grid value (1/4 notes), leaving the start
time of the region on the & of the beat.
Relative Grid mode is useful for moving a drum hit over and having it
fit within the grid, even if its start point doesn’t originally match the
grid itself.

Setting grid resolution
Setting grid resolution is an outrageously handy tool for precision-tweaking
the rhythms of your track. If you decide to go the Grid mode route, you can
set the resolution of the grid that you work in by following these steps:
1. Click and hold on the Grid Value window, located under the Edit tools
in the main Edit window, as shown in Figure 1-13.
The Grid Resolution menu appears, offering you choices for the resolu-
tion of your grid — 1/2 notes, 1/4 notes, 1/16 notes, whatever.
2. Drag to the resolution you want.
Within this menu, you can also choose the time scale you want the grid
in as well as whether you want the grid to follow the main time scale.
Displaying grid lines
Again, if you want to work in Grid mode, you might find the grid lines in the
Edit window helpful. You can get them to display by using one of two methods:
✦Select the Draw Grids in Edit Window check box in the Display tab of the
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-14. (Call up the Preferences
dialog box by choosing Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.)

✦With Grid Edit mode enabled, click the Timeline Ruler (Bars:Beats)
button to toggle the grid on and off, as shown in Figure 1-15.
Working (Okay, Playing) with Playlists
The Edit playlists within your tracks consist of various arrangements of the
regions within a track. Each track can have one or more regions that you can
arrange in any order that you want using the edit modes listed in the previous
section. Edit playlists allow you to experiment with different arrangements of
regions within a track — and you can still change them at will by switching to
another playlist. This is handy if you want to try different arrangements of
songs and easily compare them without having to create copies of entire
sessions (as you would with some other programs).
Edit playlists are accessed by clicking the Playlist selector in the Track sec-
tion of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 1-16. From the menu called up by
the Playlist selector, as shown in all its glory in Figure 1-17, you can choose
from the various playlists as well as create, duplicate, or delete them.
Creating a new playlist
When you record or import audio into a track, you automatically create an
empty playlist. With this new playlist, you can import audio regions, drag
those regions in, or copy and paste them from other tracks. You can create
additional playlists by opening the Playlist drop-down menu; just click the
Playlist selector next to the track’s name in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window and choose New. (See Figure 1-17.)

Duplicating a playlist
Being able to duplicate a playlist makes creating different arrangements of a
track or making edits to the regions in a playlist easy. Instead of creating a new
blank playlist, you start from one you already created. To duplicate a playlist,
click and hold with the mouse pointer over the Playlist selector and then
choose Duplicate. You get the option of naming the new playlist or going with
the default.
Deleting a playlist
Playlists take up no space on your hard drive, so you don’t need to delete
them to free up space. Still, if you want to delete a playlist from a session,
follow these steps.
You can’t undo this operation.
1. Make sure that the playlist you want to delete isn’t the active one in
the track.

2. Open the track’s playlist menu by clicking the Playlist selector (the
arrows located next to the track’s name in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window).
3. Choose Delete Unused.
A dialog box opens, listing all playlists in the track (except the currently
assigned playlist).
4. Select the playlist that you want to delete from the list.
To delete more than one, press and hold the Shift key while you select
the playlists.
5. Click OK.
The selected playlist is deleted.
Renaming playlists
To rename the current playlist in a track, double-click the name of the track
where the playlist resides and then type in a new name.
Choosing playlists
You can choose the playlist that appears in a track by clicking the Playlist
selector (the arrows located next to the track’s name in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and dragging to the playlist you want. The name
of the playlist then shows up as the track’s name.
Using the Audio Regions List
All the audio regions in your session are displayed in the Audio Regions list,
located on the right side of your Edit or Mix window, as shown in Figure 1-18.
From this list you can
✦Drag a region into a track.
✦Drag to rearrange regions in the list.
✦Audition any region by Option-clicking (Mac) or Alt-clicking (PC) a
region in the list.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Audio Editing
Basics
Using the Audio Regions List
353
After you start recording, importing, and editing regions in your session, you
can start accumulating regions in this list very quickly. Fortunately, Pro
Tools helps you keep track of them by displaying region types differently.
The “distinguishing marks” are as follows:
✦Whole File regions are in bold.
✦Auto-Defined and User-Defined regions are in regular text.
✦Offline regions are in italics.
✦Stereo regions contain two mono regions that can be expanded by click-
ing the triangle to the left of the region name.
Selecting regions
Here’s how to select single or multiple regions from the Audio Regions list:
✦To select a single region: Click a single region. It becomes highlighted.
Then select the Region List Selection Follows Track Selection check box
on the Editing tab of the Preferences dialog box (the dialog box you get
by choosing Setup➪Preferences from the main menu). Voilá! The track
containing this region becomes highlighted to show it’s selected.
✦To select a range of contiguous regions: You have two choices:
• With the cursor on the left of the Audio Regions list (a marquee will
appear), click and drag across the regions you want to select.
• Shift-click to the left of the first and last region names for a group of
regions. All the regions in between these two are selected.
✦To select multiple regions that aren’t next to one another: Your
method depends on your platform:
• Mac: With the cursor located over the name of the region, Ô-click
each region.
• PC: Shift-click over the name of each region.
Figure 1-18:

354
Using the Audio Regions list drop-down menu
Audio regions can also be managed from the drop-down menu located at the
top of the Audio Regions list, as shown in Figure 1-19. (The Audio Regions
list is located at the right side of the Edit window. If it isn’t visible, click the
double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Edit window to open it.) Open
this menu by clicking and holding the Audio Regions title at the top of the Audio
Regions list. Many of the functions in this menu are covered in this section.
Sorting regions
After you start editing in earnest, the regions in the Audio Regions list start
adding up. The only way to keep track of them is by being able to sort them.
Pro Tools offers you several ways to sort, including by name, time stamp
(when it was recorded), length, and a host of other parameters. To sort
regions from the Audio Regions drop-down menu, choose Sort By from the
menu and then choose one of the many options pictured in Figure 1-20.

Finding regions
You can find regions in the list by choosing Find from the Audio Regions
drop-down menu. When you do, a dialog box appears, as shown in Figure
1-21, where you can enter part of a word or a whole word for the region you
want to find.
Displaying region information
Besides displaying just the region’s name — the default for the Audio Regions
list — you can have Pro Tools display some additional information about the
region in the playlist section of the track:
✦The complete path of the region’s location: Choose the Show option
from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu; then from this list, choose
Full Path. Open this menu by clicking and holding the Audio Regions
title at the top of the Audio Regions list located on the right side of the
Edit window. (If this list isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the
bottom-right corner of the Edit window.)
✦The name of the file where the audio region is located: Choose Show
from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu; then from that list, choose
File Name.
✦The name of the hard drive where the file is located: To see this informa-
tion, choose Show from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu; then, from
that list, choose Disk Name.
Managing Undos
Here’s the realm where digital editing saves you vast quantities of time, hassle,
and frustration: Pro Tools lets you undo operations that you perform in your
sessions. This gives you vast flexibility and offers at least some safety net
when you start messing around with your songs.
Figure 1-21:
Type a word
or part of a
word of the
region you

Managing Undos
356
Setting levels of Undo
Prior to version 6.1, Pro Tools offered up to 16 levels of Undo. Versions 6.1
and later offer up to 32 levels of Undo. You don’t have to use them all, though.
In fact, if you have minimal memory on your computer, performing edit
operations in Pro Tools will quickly fill it up and really slow things down. Or, 
if your memory is really low, you might not be able to perform an edit at all
because all your previous edits are stored in RAM, right up to the number
you specify in your preferences.
Luckily, Pro Tools offers you the ability to choose the maximum levels of
Undo that your session will have. You can set these levels on your session
by doing the following:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box duly appears.
2. Click the Editing tab.
3. Type in the number of Undos you want in your session in the Levels of
Undo field at the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 1-22.
4. Click OK.
Performing Undos
Performing Undos in Pro Tools is just like any other program: Choose
Edit➪_Undo from the main menu. The Undo option also includes the name
of the operation that you’re undoing, as shown in Figure 1-23. This is helpful
when you want to perform multiple Undos because you have to move back
progressively through each operation that you performed. Keeping track of
32 operations can be tricky.
You can redo an Undo — but only the last one — by choosing Edit➪Redo
from the main menu.
Figure 1-22:
Choose the

Knowing when you can no longer Undo
Some operations result in clearing your Undo lineup. Whenever you perform
the following operations, your previous operations can no longer be undone:
✦Importing track or session data.
✦Selecting Select Unused Regions or Select Unused Regions Except Whole
Files from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu.
✦Deleting a track or clearing a region from the Audio Regions list drop-
down menu.
Pro Tools won’t warn you before you perform these operations. But hey,
sometimes we human beings actually do know what we’re doing.

B
efore you can edit any audio regions, you have to make a selection. Pro
Tools offers many ways to select material. You can select from a single
track, grouped tracks, or the entire track list. You can select from a track’s
playlist or from the Timeline ruler. And you can make adjustments to the
length and position of the selected material. All these options are covered
in this chapter.
Selecting Track Material
When you select material to edit, the selection becomes highlighted. And, if
you have the Edit and Timeline Selection Linked option chosen, you see
little arrows in the Timeline ruler designating the Start and End points of the
selection. Figure 2-1 shows a selection, whereas you can see the handy Link
Timeline and Edit Selection button right here in the margin. The arrows are
blue if no tracks are enabled for recording and red if tracks are enabled for
recording.
If you haven’t chosen the Link Timeline and Edit Selection option, Edit
markers — instead of arrows — mark your selection, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Selecting Track Material
360
Selecting part of a region
You can select material one of three ways:
✦Drag within a track’s playlist, as shown in Figure 2-3. Do this by clicking
and dragging your start and end points within the track’s playlist.
✦Drag along the Timeline ruler, as shown in Figure 2-4. Do this by clicking
and dragging your start and end points along the Timeline ruler or by
moving the Start and End Point arrows to where you want them. Doing
this selects all the unhidden tracks in the session.
✦Enter values in the Start and End fields of your Expanded section in
the Transport window, as shown in Figure 2-5. Do this by highlighting a
track and typing in your start point in the Start field and then pressing
Return/Enter. Type in your end point in the End field and press Return/
Enter, or type in the length of the selection in the Length field and press
Return/Enter.
When you make a selection within a track that is part of a group, all tracks in
the group — except those that are specifically hidden — are selected.

2. Make sure that you have the Edit and Timeline Selection Linked
option enabled by selecting Options➪Link Timeline and Edit Selection
or by clicking the Link Timeline and Edit Selection button.
3. With the Selector tool, click in the audio track somewhere before the
start point of the area you want to select.

point.
Again, if you go too far, you can back up the end point by pressing
Shift+Option+Tab (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+Tab (PC).
Making Changes to Your Selection
Try as you might, after you make a selection on one of your tracks, you might
find that your selection just doesn’t cut it. Maybe you end up with too much
or too little material at the beginning or end of the selection. Or you decide
that you want to move the entire selection over in time to encompass 

Making Changes to Your Selection
366
different material. Perhaps you decide that you want to include other tracks
in the selection. You also might want to change the track onto which you
made your selection. Luckily, you don’t have to start over selecting material
to do this. You can make these adjustments to a selection quickly and easily
in Pro Tools. This section describes these ways to change what you selected.
Changing a selection’s length
After you make a selection, if you want to change its start or end point (say,
skip the first two bars of your selection), you can do so by doing one of the
following:
✦With the Selector tool, Shift-click at the point you want outside the current
selection.
✦With the Selector tool, Shift-drag either the start or end point to where
you want it.
✦Drag the Playback marker (or Edit marker if the Edit and Timeline selections
are unlinked) for the start or end point in the Timeline ruler (the section
in the Edit window with the time markers located above the track playlists).
✦Type in the new start or end point value in the Start or End field of the
Expanded section of the Transport window and then press Return/Enter.
Nudging selections
Sometimes, you want to move a selection very slightly forward or back in
the Timeline to make sure you cover the exact material you want to edit. Pro
Tools lets you use the Nudge function to move either your entire selection or
just its start or end point so you can fine-tune your selections.
Nudging the entire selection
You can move a selection by the increments set up in your Nudge Value
menu so that you can move across the material without actually moving that
material itself. (The latter move is done after you finish making a selection;
see Chapter 3 of this mini-book.) Follow these steps:
1. Make your selection using one of the procedures listed earlier in this
chapter.
2. Click and hold on the Nudge Value drop-down menu, located next to
Nudge below the Counter section of the Edit window.
The Nudge Value menu pops up.

3. Select the desired value for your nudge in the drop-down menu, as
shown in Figure 2-6.
For more on using the Nudge feature, go to the next chapter (Chapter 3
of this mini-book).
4. Press the Shift key along with either the + key or – key.
Doing so “nudges” your selection to the right or left, respectively, by the
designated nudge value.
If you have the Commands Keyboard focus function enabled by depressing
the Command Focus button, you can skip pressing the Shift key while you
use the + or – keys.
Nudging the start point
Follow these steps to move the start point of a selection by the nudge value:
1. Make your selection using one of the procedures listed earlier in this
chapter.
2. Click and hold the Nudge Value drop-down menu, located next to
Nudge below the Counter section of the Edit window.
The Nudge Value menu pops up. (Refer to Figure 2-6.)
3. Select the desired value for your nudge in the drop-down menu.
For more on using the Nudge feature, check out Book IV, Chapter 3.
4. Press Option+Shift (Mac) or Alt+Shift (PC), and then press the + or –
key on your keyboard to “nudge” the Start point to the right or left,
respectively, by the designated nudge value.

4. Press Ô+Shift (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift (PC)and press the + or – key on your
keyboard to move the end point the designated nudge value to the
right or left, respectively.
Extending selection lengths
Sometimes, the best way to get all the material in your selection is to redefine
its boundaries. Pro Tools offers you three ways to extend your selection: to
the start or end point of the selected region, to include an adjacent region, or
to markers (memory locations). These options are covered in the following
sections.
Extending to the start or end point of a selected region
Follow these steps to extend your selection to the start or end point of the
region:
1. Select a portion of the region by using the Selector tool, or simply
click anywhere in that region.
Choose the Selector tool by clicking the Selector button at the top of the
Edit window.
2. Press Shift+Tab to extend the selection to the end of the region or
press Shift+Option+Tab (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+Tab (PC) to extend your
selection to the start of the region.
Extending a selection to an adjacent region
Use the following steps to extend a selection to include an adjacent region:
1. With the Grabber tool, click the first region to select it.
2. Press Shift+Control+Tab (Mac) or Shift+Windows+Tab (PC) to include
the following region. Or, press Shift+Control+Option+Tab (Mac) or
Shift+Windows+Ctrl+Tab (PC) to include the previous region.

Extending a selection to a memory location (marker)
Memory locations (markers) are flags you can place within the session to make
navigating your session faster. I usually make a habit of putting a marker at the
beginning of each verse and chorus to help me find them quickly. To extend a
selection to a marker or memory location, follow these steps:
1. Click the start or end point in a track or make a selection in one of the
ways listed earlier in this chapter.
2. Shift-click a marker in the Markers ruler (located above the track
playlist section of the Edit window) or a memory location in the
Memory Locations window.
The Memory Locations window is opened by clicking any of the markers
in your session or by clicking the Marker icon at the left of the Markers
ruler.
Moving and extending selections between tracks
You can take a selection on a track and extend it to include other tracks, or
you can even move the selection to another track. For example, this is handy
if you select the snare drum and then decide that you want to include the
rest of the drum tracks in your edit. Another example is selecting one rhythm
guitar track but deciding that you want to edit another rhythm guitar track
instead. The following sections cover these options.
Moving a selection to another track
After you make a selection, if you decide that you’d rather edit a different track
instead — while still using the same start and end points as the selection you
already made — you can move the selection from one track to another. This
process is done by following these steps:
1. Click the Commands Focus button, as seen here in the margin, to
enable the Commands Focus function.
2. Make a selection, using one of the procedures listed earlier in this
chapter.
3. Press P to move the selection to the previous (above) track, or press ;
(semicolon) to move the selection to the following (below) track.

Managing Memory Locations
370
Extending a selection to an adjacent track
To include adjacent tracks in your selection — as in the case of adding drum
tracks to a selection you made on the snare drum track — you can do this by
following these steps:
1. Click the Commands Focus button to enable the Commands Focus
function.
2. Make a selection in a track in one of the ways listed earlier in this
chapter.
3. Press Shift+P to include the previous (above) track, or press Shift+;
(semicolon) to include the following (below) track.
Figure 2-7 shows what happens when you extend a selection to include
an adjacent track.
If you got overzealous in extending your selection to adjacent tracks, you
can remove the bottom track from this group by pressing Control+Option+;
(semicolon; Mac) or Windows+Alt+; (semicolon; PC).
Managing Memory Locations
Memory locations let you quickly move from one position in a session to
another with the click of a button. You can have up to 200 memory markers
in each session.

Dealing with the New Memory Location dialog box
Whenever you create a memory location, a dialog box opens (as shown in
Figure 2-8), where you choose the parameters of the marker. This box
contains two sections: Time Properties and General Properties.
Setting time properties
In the Time Properties section of the New Memory Location dialog box, you
can choose from three options — Marker, Selection, and None — as well as
whether you want the reference in bar/beat (the location in your session
related to measures) or absolute time (the location in your session related to
the clock in minutes and seconds from the start of the session).
The following list fills you in on what each of the three options here means:
✦Marker: This option marks a specific location and is designated by a
yellow icon in the Markers ruler — the ruler located at the top of the
playlist section of the Edit window. If you set the reference for the loca-
tion marker to Bar/Beat, the icon is a chevron (Figure 2-9, left). If you set
the reference to Absolute, it appears as a diamond (Figure 2-9, right).

lets you

Managing Memory Locations
372
✦Selection: Using this option marks a selected range within a track or
multiple tracks.
✦None: This type of memory location is called a General Properties memory
location. It actually doesn’t contain any time-based information; rather, it
memorizes just the selections from the General Properties section of the
dialog box. (See the next section for more on the General Properties area.)
This is a good option if you just want to remember a zoom or pre- and 
post-roll setting for part of the session.
Choosing general properties
In the General Properties section of the Memory Location dialog box (refer
to Figure 2-8), you can set preferences for the information that you store
with the memory location. These include
✦Number: This is the marker number for your session. You can renumber
any memory location by clicking in the field and typing the number you
want for the location.
✦Name: You can enter a name in this field to help you remember what the
memory location is for.
✦Zoom Settings: Use this option to store the horizontal and vertical zoom
settings for the tracks.
✦Pre/Post Roll Times: This option, which stores the pre- and post-roll
times, is handy when using the Selection memory location for setting
record ranges.
✦Track Show/Hide: This setting allows you to store track layouts in your
session (as far as them being shown or hidden, anyway).
✦Track Heights: This option lets you store the height of tracks in your
session.
✦Group Enables: This setting stores both Edit and Mix groups for easy
recall of them when mixing or editing.
✦Window Configuration: This drop-down menu lets you choose one of your
saved window configurations. You can find out more about configuring
windows in Book II, Chapter 4.
✦Comments: You can enter any comments or reminder in this section.
This is handy for remembering what the marker is marking.
Creating memory locations
You create memory locations differently depending on the type — Marker,
Selection, None — that you want. The following sections detail those ways.

kind of auditioning is done in the following ways.
Auditioning the start point
You can audition the start point of a selection either with or without listening
to the pre-roll along with it. Both options are covered in this section.
✦To audition just the start point of a selection: Press Ô+←(Mac) or
Ctrl+←(PC). The selection plays for the length of time designated in the
Post-Roll field of the Transport window.
✦To audition the start point of a selection along with the pre-roll: Press
Ô+Option+←(Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+←(PC). The pre-roll plays along with the
length of the selection, as designated in the Post-Roll field of the Transport
window as long as you have the Pre/Post-roll Playback function enabled.
(Choose Options➪Pre/Post-roll from the main menu.)

Playing Selected Material
384
Auditioning the end point
Pro Tools lets you audition the end point of your selection, either with or
without hearing the post-roll too. Here’s how to use these options:
✦To audition just the end point of a selection: Press Option+→(Mac) or
Alt+→(PC). The selection starts at the point equal to the pre-roll
amount from the end of the selection.
✦To audition the end point of a selection along with the post-roll: Press
Ô+Option+→(Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+→(PC). The selection starts at the point
equal to the pre-roll amount from the end of the selection and continue
until the end of the post-roll.
Looping your selection’s playback
If you have a section of the song that you want to listen to repeatedly (say, if
you’re trying to find a chair squeak to edit), you can loop a selection with
the Loop command. This enables you to create looped sections and to make
sure that your start and end points play seamlessly. Follow these steps to
loop a selection:
1. Engage the Link Timeline and Edit Selection option by choosing
Options➪Link Timeline and Edit Selection from the main menu or by
clicking the Link Timeline and Edit Selection button.
2. Make a selection by using one of the techniques listed in the “Selecting
Track Material” section, earlier in this chapter.
3. Choose Options➪Loop Playback from the main menu, or Control-click
(Mac) or right-click (PC) the Play button in the Transport window.
4. Click Play in the Transport window or press the spacebar on your
keyboard.
If you have the pre-roll engaged, playback will begin with it; otherwise, it
starts at the beginning of your selection. When the selection loops, the
pre-and post-rolls won’t play after the starting pre-roll (if you have the
function engaged).
5. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the spacebar on your
keyboard to stop playback.

P
ro Tools offers you many options for editing the audio files in your
sessions, include cutting file segments, copying them, pasting them,
clearing them, basting them, and marinating them. (Okay, maybe not the 
last two, but you get the point.) You can also edit by trimming segments,
moving them, aligning them, locking them, and so on.
In this chapter, you discover the many Edit commands of Pro Tools and you
begin to edit regions — the term for audio file segments — using the various
Edit functions that Pro Tools is famous for. I also fill you in on creating loops
you can use to build your song (if that’s the way you want to work).
Editing Regions
Regions are the defined areas of the track in which you do your editing. Each
audio file is represented in your session by a region (or series of regions). A
region can be the entire file, or it can be bits and pieces of a file. When you
edit in Pro Tools, you’re not actually making any changes to the audio file.
(Later in this chapter, I explain some exceptions to this.) Instead, you make
changes to the way Pro Tools plays those files by editing the regions that
represent the file.
For example, if you decide that a track really does sound better without that
accordion solo and you cut that section of the region containing that part, the
section isn’t really erased from your hard drive: It’s simply not played back
when you listen to your session. This allows you to make a stunning variety of
edits without having to worry about ruining your original audio file.
Being able to create, capture, separate, trim, and heal regions is essential 
to being able to edit in Pro Tools. I explain these procedures in the following
sections.

Editing Regions
386
Creating regions
Whenever you record or import an audio file in Pro Tools, you create a
region of that entire file. You can edit that region. However, after you cut,
separate, paste, or perform any other edit to it, you’re creating new regions
from the original file. You have several ways to create new regions with
which to work, including capturing selections, separating selections, and
trimming to a selection. These are all covered in the following sections.
When you create a new region, it appears in the track’s playlist — the area
next to the Track Controls section of the Edit window that contains the
visual representations of the audio files (regions) — as well as in the Audio
Regions list, located on the right side of the Edit and the Mix windows.
Using the Capture Region command
Use the Capture Region command to create a new region within an existing
one. The new region is still part of the original region, but it has its own
name. If you want to create a region that can be moved around separately
from the original, use the Separate Regions command, as detailed in the next
section. To use the Capture Region command, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selector tool from the top of the Edit window.
2. Click and drag the track’s region in the playlist section of the Edit
window where you want to create a new region.
3. Choose Region➪Capture from the main menu or press Ô+R (Mac) or
Ctrl+R (PC).
4. In the Name Region dialog box that appears, enter the name of this
region and then click OK.
The new region is created, and the region’s name appears in the Audio
Regions list menu in the track’s playlist.
Employing the Separate Regions command
If you want to create a region that can be moved around separately from the
original, use the Separate Regions command. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Choose the Selector tool from the top of the Edit window.
2. Click and drag on the track’s region in the track’s playlist where you
want to create a new region.
To select more than one track, drag across the desired tracks.
3. Choose Edit➪Separate Region from the main menu or press Ô+E
(Mac) or Ctrl+E (PC).
Here, you have three options of where to create the region:

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
387
• At Selection: Choose At Selection to create a new region with boundaries
at the selection start and end points.
• On Grid: Choose On Grid to create a region according to the current
grid resolution.
• At Transients: Chose At Transients to automatically create region
boundaries on detected transients within a selection. The program
does this with the same method as when you employ the Tab to
Transients feature.
4. In the Name Region dialog box that appears, enter the name of this
region and then click OK.
The new region is created, and its name appears in the Audio Regions
list menu. You can now move, copy, cut, or otherwise edit this region.
If you don’t want to have to type in a name for this new region, you can use
the Pro Tools Auto-Name feature, which automatically gives your new regions
such exciting names as Audio 2_02. To activate this feature, choose Setup➪
Preferences from the main menu, click the Editing tab in the Preferences dialog
box when it appears, and then select the Auto-Name Separated Regions
check box on that tab.
If you have a bunch of takes that you recorded in succession (when you
loop-record, for example) and you want to separate them all at the same
place, select the Separate Region Operates on All Related Takes check box
on the Editing tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setup➪Preferences
from the main menu to get to the Preference dialog box.) If you do this, make
sure that both the Take Region Names That Match Track Names and Take
Regions Lengths That Match options are also selected on the second Editing
tab of Preferences dialog box.
Using the Separation Grabber tool
If you want to separate and move a region in one step, you can use the
Separation Grabber tool, located in the Edit Tools section of the Edit window.
You can toggle between the Grabber tool and the Separation Grabber tool by
clicking and holding the Grabber button and choosing the Separation option
from the pop-up menu that appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1:
Toggle the
Grabber and
Separation
Grabber
tools.

Editing Regions
388
To use the Separation Grabber tool, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, drag over the part of the region you want to
separate in the playlist section of the Edit window.
This selection can be across multiple tracks or regions within a single track.
2. Click and hold the Grabber tool and choose the Separation option
from the pop-up menu that appears.
3. Click the selection you made in Step 1 and drag the selection to where
you want.
Pro Tools automatically creates three new regions: the separated section
as well as the parts before and after this section. These three sections all
show up in the Audio Regions list menu.
If you want to leave the original region as it is and grab a section from it to
put somewhere else, press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) when you drag the
selection with the Separation Grabber tool. The original region remains
intact, and your selection is simply copied and moved.
Trying the Trim to Selection command
Use the Trim to Selection command to choose a section of a region and
remove the unselected parts of that region. Follow these steps to trim
unwanted parts from a selection:
1. Choose the area you want to keep by selecting it in the track’s playlist
with the Selector tool.
2. Press Ô+T (Mac) or Ctrl+T (PC) or choose Edit➪Trim Region➪To
Selection from the main menu, as shown in Figure 3-2.
The unselected parts of the region disappear.
Healing regions
Use the Heal Separations command to recombine regions that you separated.
Here are some restrictions to this process:
✦You can’t heal regions that come from different audio files.
✦Your regions must be in the same places they were when you separated
them.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
389
To heal two regions, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, select a portion of both regions along with the
spot to be healed, as shown in Figure 3-3.
2. Choose Edit➪Heal Separation from the main menu or press Ô+H
(Mac) or Ctrl+H (PC).
Your two regions become one again.
If the selection doesn’t heal (because one region has been moved, for
instance), you can use one of the following remedies:
✦Find what’s hidden. This procedure expands the region to include
hidden material. In this case, the hidden material is the stuff from the
deleted region.
a. Choose Slip Edit mode (from the Edit mode options at the top-left portion
of the Edit window).

b. Delete one of the two regions.
c. With the Trimmer tool, expand the existing region to its original size.
(See the “Trimming regions” section, later in this chapter, for more
on the Trimmer tool.)
✦Delete both regions and drag the original region into the track from
the Audio Regions list. Chapter 1 in this mini-book has more on this
procedure.
Placing regions in tracks
All the regions for your session are located in the Audio Regions list; you can
use this list to drag a region (or regions) into any track.
Placing a region in a track
Follow these steps to place a region in a track:
1. Select the region you want to place in a track by highlighting it in the
Audio Regions list.
The Audio Regions list is located on the right side of the Edit and the
Mix windows.
2. Click the region’s name and drag it into the track where you want it.
Depending on the Edit mode that you select (from the options located at the
upper-left corner of the Edit window), your region is placed in one of several
possible ways:
✦In Shuffle mode: Placing a region while in Shuffle mode slides existing
regions to make room for the one you’re placing. This places regions end
to end: They automatically touch one another.
✦In Spot mode: Placing a region while in Spot mode opens a dialog box
where you can enter the position of the region you’re placing. This mode
allows you to place a region at a precise point.
✦In Slip mode: Placing a region while in Slip mode lets you drag the
region anywhere you want within the track’s playlist, allowing you to
overlap another region or be separated from it.
✦In Grid mode: Placing a region in Grid mode places the region to the
nearest grid boundary. Pro Tools lets you temporarily disable the grid
by pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) while you drag your selected region
into a track.
You can adjust the grid value for your session by opening the Grid Value
drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 3-4. (To open this menu, click and hold
the arrow to the right of the Grid title in the center of the Edit menu, right
below the Edit tools.)

Placing a region at the Edit Insert point
You can designate an Edit Insert point by clicking your cursor within a track
in the playlist section of the Edit window; you can then place your region
right at this point. You can have either the region’s start or end point snap to
the Edit Insert point.
To designate an Edit Insert point, start by locating your cursor at the place
in the track where you want the region placed, as shown in Figure 3-5. Then,
depending on where you want your region to end up, do one of the following:
✦To place the start of a region at the Edit Insert point: Press Control
(Mac) or Windows (PC) while you drag the region from the Audio
Regions list to the track.
✦If the region is already in the track and you want to move it: Press
Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) while dragging with the Grabber tool.
✦To place the end of a region at the Edit Insert point: Press Ô+Control
(Mac) or Ctrl+ Windows (PC) while you drag the region from the Audio
Regions list to the track.
✦If the region already resides in the track: Press Ô+Control (Mac) or
Ctrl+Windows (PC) while dragging with the Grabber tool.

Using region synch points
A synch point is a specific location in your session where you can have regions
align. This lets you place a specific point in the region (the synch point) precisely
where you want without regard to the placements of start or end points of that
region. You can assign a region synch point in Pro Tools anywhere within the
session. This feature is helpful when you want to place a sound at a precise
point in the session, like when you’re spotting (positioning) sound effects for
video. With a synch point, you first mark the location sound effect that you want
to place (breaking glass, for instance) in the region with this sound and then
place that region where you want the glass to start breaking in your session.
This makes it easy to spot that sound even when the sound doesn’t begin at the
start point of a region.
Creating a synch point
To define a region’s synch point, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, click within a track where you want your synch
point to be.
2. Choose Region➪Identify Synch Point from the main menu, as shown
in Figure 3-6, or press Ô+, (comma; Mac) or Ctrl+, (comma; PC).
A small arrow appears at the bottom of the region, as shown in Figure 3-7,
to show you where you placed the synch point.
You can remove the synch point by choosing Region➪Remove Synch Point
from the main menu.
Each region can have only one synch point at a time. To change the location
of this synch point, simply select a new place in the region and choose Region➪
Identify Synch Point again from the main menu. The old synch point is
removed, and a new one appears at the new location.

Define a
synch point
from the Edit
menu.

Editing Regions
393
Placing a region’s synch point at an Edit Insert point
After you have a synch point defined, you can use it to place or align a region
within your track’s playlist. To place the synch point of the region to the Edit
Insert point in the track’s playlist, do the following:
1. With the Selector tool, click a point in the target region to define your
Edit Insert point.
2. Press Shift+Control (Mac) or Shift+ Windows (PC) while dragging the
region you want to insert — the one containing the synch point you
added, following the procedure outlined in the previous step list —
from the Audio Regions list into the track.
The region’s synch point snaps to the selected position in the track’s
playlist.
or
If the region with the synch point already resides within the track,
switch to the Grabber tool and then press Shift+Control (Mac) or Shift+
Windows (PC) while clicking the region.
The region’s synch point snaps to the selected position in the track’s
playlist.
Aligning regions
Pro Tools lets you align the start, end, or synch point of regions to the start
point of another region. This can be helpful for arranging regions in songs to
get synchronized playback.
Aligning a start point of a region with the start point of a region on
another track
To align a start point of a region with the start point of a region on another
track, follow these steps:
1. With the Grabber tool, click the region in the playlist of the track you
want to align to.
Figure 3-7:
An arrow at

2. If the region you want to move already exists in the playlist of the
track from Step 1, press Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) and then click
the region you want to move.
The region automatically moves into position.
or
If the region you want to move resides in the Audio Regions list, press
Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) and then click and drag the region onto
the track’s playlist.
Both start points are aligned.
Aligning the end point of a region with the start point 
of a region on a different track
To align the end point of a region with the start point of a region on a differ-
ent track, follow these steps:
1. With the Grabber tool, click the region you want to align to in the
track’s playlist.
2. If the region you want to move is located in the playlist of the track
from Step 1, press Ô+Control (Mac) or Ctrl+ Windows (PC) and then
click the region.
The region automatically moves into position.
or
If this region isn’t already in the track’s playlist, press Ô+Control (Mac)
or Ctrl+ Windows (PC) and click and drag the region you want to move
from the Audio Regions list onto the playlist.
The end point of the region you moved is aligned to the start point of
the first region you chose.
Aligning a region’s synch point with the start point 
of another track’s region
To align the synch point of a region with the start point of a region on a
different track, follow these steps:
1. With the Grabber tool, click the region you want to align to in the
track’s playlist.

Book IV
Chapter 3

Editing Regions
395
2. If the region you want to move is located in the playlist of the track
from Step 1, press Shift+Control (Mac) or Shift+Windows (PC) while
clicking with the Grabber tool on the region.
The region automatically moves into position.
or
If the region doesn’t already exist within the track’s playlist, you can
place and align a region from the Audio Regions list by pressing
Shift+Control (Mac) or Shift+Windows (PC) while clicking and dragging
the region from the Audio Regions list.
The synch point of the second region aligns to the start point of the first,
as shown in Figure 3-8.
Trimming regions
You can trim regions by using the Trimmer tool, choosing Edit➪Trim Region
from the main menu, or nudging the start or end point of a region. The
Trimmer tool, as shown here in the margin, consists of two options: the
Standard Trimmer and the Time Trimmer. These trimming options are
detailed in the following sections.
Using the Standard Trimmer tool
Use the Standard Trimmer tool to shorten or lengthen (to the maximum length
of the parent audio file, anyway) a region without altering the original file.
Whenever you trim a region, a new region is created in the Audio Regions list.
To trim a region with the Standard Trimmer tool, first call up the tool by
clicking the Trimmer Tool button. Then do one of the following:
✦Place the cursor near the start or end point of a region and drag the
region’s start or end point to shorten or lengthen, as shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-8:
You can
align the
synch point
from one
region to the
start point of

Editing Regions
396
✦Place your cursor where you want to trim the region and click with
your mouse, as shown in Figure 3-10.
The region is trimmed to the start point or the end point, depending on
where you place the cursor. If the cursor is located closer to the start
point, you trim the start point; conversely, if the cursor is closer to the
end point, you trim the end point. You can reverse the default here by
pressing Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while you trim.
You can tell which way the trim is going to happen by the direction of the
cursor. Figure 3-11 shows the cursor as it is set to trim the start point (left)
and the end point (right).

Editing Regions
397
The Trimmer tools (both the Standard Trimmer and the Time Trimmer)
behave differently depending on the Edit mode you’re using. Here’s a quick
rundown of the differences:
✦Shuffle mode: In this mode, any adjacent regions slide over while you
expand or trim the region.
✦Spot mode: In this mode, the Spot dialog box appears, prompting you to
type in the exact placement of the region’s start or end point.
✦Grid mode: In this mode, any trimming or expanding that you do auto-
matically snaps to the nearest grid boundary.
✦Slip mode: In this mode, your region moves to wherever you place it.
Any other regions in the playlist remain where they are.
If you want to return the region to its original size, you can
✦Drag the original region from the Audio Regions list to the track’s
playlist.
✦Drag the start or end point of the region with the Trimmer tool to its
original length.
Tackling the Time Trimmer tool
Use the Time Trimmer tool, as shown here in the margin, to expand or com-
press a region by using the Time Compression/Expansion (TC/E) plug-in to
create a new audio file. Using the Time Trimmer is different from using the
Standard Trimmer: Instead of cutting off part of the file when you trim, 
the Time Trimmer tool shortens how long the region takes to play.
When you use the Time Trimmer tool to expand or compress a region, it alters
the speed at which the region plays — and this alters how the material in the
region sounds. Compressing speeds up the region; expanding slows it down.
To use the Time Trimmer tool, call it up by clicking and holding over the
Trimmer tool button and then dragging down to select the Time Trimmer
option. Then do one of the following:
✦Place the cursor near the start or end point of a region and drag the
region’s start or end point to shorten or lengthen the region. (Refer to
Figure 3-9.)
✦Place your cursor where you want to expand or contract the region
and click with your mouse. (Refer to Figure 3-10.)
The start or end point of the region moves out or in depending on which
way the Time Trimmer Tool cursor is facing. (See upcoming Figure 3-12.)

Editing Regions
398
The Edit mode you use determines how the Time Trimmer tool behaves and
how the regions surrounding the trim react. Check out the previous section
for a rundown of the different ways that the Edit modes work with the trim
tools.
To return the region to its original length, follow these steps:
✦Drag the original region from the Audio Regions list to the track’s
playlist.
✦Choose Edit➪Undo from the main menu (assuming this was the last
operation you performed).
Taking advantage of the Trim command
You can trim regions using the Trim command located in the Edit menu.
(Refer to Figure 3-2.) The menu gives you three options:
✦Trim to Selection: Using this command removes all the region except
the part you selected, as shown in Figure 3-12. To do this trim, select the
part of the region that you want to keep and then choose this command.
✦Trim Start to Insertion: This command trims the region from the start
point to the Edit Insert point designated by your cursor, as shown in
Figure 3-13. To perform this trim, start by placing your cursor where you
want to trim to and then choose this command.
Figure 3-13:

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
399
✦Trim End to Insertion: Using this command removes that part of the
region from the Edit Insert point to the end point of the region, as shown
in Figure 3-14. Doing this trim is as simple as placing your cursor at the
desired place in the region and then choosing the command from the
Edit menu.
Using the Nudge function to trim a region
You can trim or expand the start or end points of a region using the plus (+)
and minus (–) keys on the number pad section of your keyboard. (To see
how to set the Nudge value, go to the next section, “Moving regions.”)
Here’s how to trim the start point by using the Nudge function:
1. With the Grabber tool, select a region.
2. Press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) along with the plus (+) key to trim or
the minus (–) key to expand the start point.
Each time you press the key, you move the boundary of the region by
the Nudge value.
To trim the end point with the Nudge function
1. With the Grabber tool, select a region.
2. Press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) along with the plus (+) key to expand or the
minus (–) key to trim the end point.
Each time you press the key, you move the boundary of the region by
the Nudge value.
Moving regions
You can move (that is, slide) regions in a session either within a track or across
tracks. You can nudge them, shift them, and — depending on the Edit mode
you’re using — move them to precisely where you want them. This section
details the many ways you can move regions.
Figure 3-14:
The Trim
End to
Insertion
command.

Editing Regions
400
Before you do any moving, however, keep two things in mind:
✦You can make a copy of a region you want to slide by pressing Option
(Mac) or Alt (PC) while you slide it. This keeps the original in its place.
✦When you move a region from one track to another, you can keep its
start point from changing by pressing Control (Mac) or Windows (PC)
while you slide it. This lets you move regions from track to track without
losing (ahem) track of its position in the session.
Nudging
If you want to move a region only a little bit, simply nudge it. With the Nudge
function, you can set the Nudge value to be as fine or as coarse as you like.
To set the Nudge value, click and hold the arrow to the right of the Nudge title
located just beneath the Counters in the Edit window to open the Nudge Value
drop-down menu. Then select the scale and value you want, as shown in
Figure 3-15. You can choose Bars:Beats, Min:Sec, or Samples for your Nudge
scale. The values you choose depend on this scale. You can also choose to
follow the main time scale for the session by selecting that option at the
bottom of the dialog box.
To actually nudge a region or multiple regions, do the following:
1. With the Grabber tool, select the region or regions that you want to
move.
Select the Grabber by clicking its icon in the upper part of the Edit window.
To select more than one region, press the Shift key while you grab each
region.
Figure 3-15:
Set the

2. Press the plus (+) key or minus (–) key in the numerical section of your
keyboard to move it right or left, respectively.
Each press of the key moves the region over by the Nudge value.
If you want to move the region over faster and still use the Nudge function,
you can have Pro Tools move the region by the next higher Nudge value than
the one you chose. For example, if you have the Nudge value set for quarter
notes, you can nudge by half notes. Here’s the drill:
1. With the Grabber tool, select the region(s) you want to nudge.
2. Press Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) as well as the slash key (/) to
move the material forward (right) or the M key to nudge it back (left).
You can skip using the Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) keys if you have
the Commands Focus button enabled.
You can nudge the contents within a region without moving its start or end
points. This lets you keep the region you have as well as its start and end
points while changing which material from the region’s parent audio file is
contained within the region’s boundaries.
1. With the Grabber tool, select the region you want to nudge.
2. Press Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) and the plus (+) key to move the
region’s content to the right and minus (–) key to move the contents to
the left.
The region stays put, and the audio from the original file moves within it,
as shown in Figure 3-16.
This process works only if audio information is located outside the current
region’s boundaries.

Shifting regions
Use the Pro Tools Shift command to move regions by a specified amount.
This is very handy when compensating for latency, such as with the Mbox or
with some plug-ins.
To shift regions via the Shift command, follow these steps:
1. Select a region, using either the Grabber or the Selector tool.
You can select regions from more than one track. (Check out Book IV,
Chapter 2 for details on how to do this.)
2. Choose Edit➪Shift from the main menu.
The Shift dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-17.
3. Enter the Shift value in the Shift dialog box as well as whether you
want to shift the region earlier or later.
This value can be in whatever time format you want: bars and beats,
minutes and seconds, or samples.
4. Click OK.
The region shifts by the amount you specify in Step 3.
The Edit mode you’re in has no effect on how the Shift command works.
Your region moves over by the specified amount regardless of whether any
other regions are present on that spot.
Moving with Edit modes
When you move or slide regions around in sessions, each Edit mode treats
the regions differently. In this section, I describe how these modes work.
(You select your Edit mode by clicking on the corresponding mode name in
the upper-left side of the Edit window.)

✦Shuffle mode: You can shuffle regions by selecting the Shuffle Edit
mode. This mode lets you shuffle the regions in a track around, but they
always snap to one another — start point to end point.
✦Slip mode: In Slip Edit mode, you can move regions around at will. You
can have space between them and have them overlap.
If you place a region in a track using Slip mode and then switch to
Shuffle mode, that region stays where it is while you shuffle other
regions in the track. These other regions might end up overlapping the
slipped region, or you might end up with empty space between them.
✦Spot mode: In Spot mode, whenever you select a region or part of a
region, the Spot dialog box opens, prompting you to enter your destina-
tion location.
✦Grid mode: In Grid mode, your regions snap to the nearest grid bound-
ary when you move them around. Grid mode offers you two options:
• Absolute: Whenever you move a region in Absolute mode, the start
point moves to the nearest grid boundary.
• Relative: When you move a region in Relative mode, it moves by grid
increments (the square units of the grid). This allows you to move a
region around while keeping its start point at the same position rela-
tive to a grid boundary.
For example, if you have a region that starts on the last sixteenth note of a
beat and your grid value is set for quarter notes, here’s what the move looks
like: Each time you move the region by one grid increment, the region moves
by the value of one quarter note — but it stays at the last sixteenth note of
the beat. This is handy for moving around drum rhythms.
You can change the grid resolution by opening the Grid drop-down menu —
refer to Figure 3-4 — and choosing the grid scale and value. You open this
menu by clicking and holding the arrow to the right of the Grid title situated
under the Edit tools at the upper end of the Edit window.
You can show the grid in the Edit menu by clicking the Timebase ruler icon,
located at the top of the Timebase ruler section of the Edit window. This grid
is labeled with whatever time format you chose for your main counter. You
can also select the Draw Grid in Edit Window option, on the Display tab of
the Preferences dialog box, to show the grid. (Choose Setup➪Preferences
from the main menu to call up the Preferences dialog box.)

Editing Regions
404
Locking regions
You can lock regions in place after you put them where you want them. This
keeps you from accidentally moving or deleting them when you work with
other regions in the session. To lock a region, do the following:
1. With the Grabber tool, select one or more regions.
To select multiple regions on different tracks, press and hold the Shift
key while you click each region.
2. Choose Region➪Lock/Unlock from the main menu.
A small closed-lock icon appears at the lower-left corner of the region, as
shown in Figure 3-18.
To unlock a region, select the region and choose Region➪Lock/Unlock from
the main menu.
In effect, because they won’t move, any region after the locked region is also
locked when you’re in Shuffle mode. Also, in this mode, you can’t place a
region in front of the locked one if it’s longer than the space available for it.
Quantizing regions
Quantizing regions in Pro Tools involves snapping a region’s start or synch
point (if you have one defined) to the nearest grid boundary. It’s a way to
align regions, which is handy for working with drum and percussion parts
because you can arrange them and then quantize them to make them fit the
groove of the song. To quantize a region, follow these steps:
1. Set the grid value that you want in the Grid Value drop-down menu.
You open this menu by clicking and holding the arrow to the right of the
Grid title, located just beneath the Edit tool sections at the top of the
Edit window.
2. With the Grabber tool, select the region you want to quantize.
Selecting part of a region quantizes the entire region because this com-
mand moves the start point (and the rest of the region with it).

3. Choose Region➪Quantize to Grid from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 3-19, or press Ô+0 (zero; Mac) or Ctrl+0 (zero; PC).
The region’s start or synch point moves to the nearest grid boundary.
Muting/unmuting regions
You can mute regions or parts of regions. This gives you more flexibility than
muting an entire track. To mute a region, do the following:
1. Select a region or a portion of one.
• To select the entire region: Use the Grabber tool and click anywhere
on that region within the track’s playlist.
• To select a portion of a region: Use the Selector tool and drag across
the region in the track’s playlist.
2. Press Ô+M (Mac) or Ctrl+M (PC) or choose Region➪Mute/Unmute
from the main menu.
When muted, the region appears dimmed in the playlist, as shown in
Figure 3-20.

region.
You select the Grabber tool by clicking the Grabber tool button at the
top of the Edit window.
2. Choose Region➪Mute/Unmute from the main menu or press Ô+M
(Mac) or Ctrl+M (PC).
What was muted is now unmuted.
Splitting stereo tracks
When you work with stereo tracks, you usually work with both sides of the
stereo file at once. If you want to edit one or another of the stereo channels
independently, the first step toward doing so is splitting the stereo track into
two mono tracks.
You split a stereo track into two mono tracks by following these steps:
1. Click the track in the Edit or Mix window with the Grabber tool to select
the track you want to split, as shown in the upper part of Figure 3-21.
If you want to split more than one track, Shift-click the rest of the tracks.
2. Choose Track➪Split into Mono from the main menu.
The tracks are split and renamed automatically, as shown at the bottom
of Figure 3-21.

Examining Edit Commands
407
Examining Edit Commands
If you’ve worked with any word processing program, you’re probably famil-
iar with Edit commands, such as cut, copy, clear, duplicate, and paste. Pro
Tools, being the super-editor of audio it is, offers a few more: repeat and
merge-paste. All these Edit commands are detailed in the following sections.
The view that you choose for a track affects the kinds of edits you can make
using the commands in this section. If you have the Waveform view open, for
example, any edit you do affects all the parameters for that track — including
automation data. Comparatively, if you have one of the Automation Parameters
views open, that parameter is the only one affected by the edit.
Each Edit mode treats the material in the tack differently when you use the
Edit commands in this section. For instance, when you use Shuffle mode,
regions slide over to make room for a pasted region (or to close the gap left
from a cut region). Likewise, in Slip mode, existing regions stay put, no
matter whether a space is left after cutting or if regions overlap from pasting.
Using the Cut command
Like in most programs that have a Cut command, any selection that you cut
is removed from the track and placed in the Clipboard, from which you can
paste it somewhere else. Here’s how to cut a region or selection:
1. Click and hold the Track View selector (located in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and drag down the list to choose the track
view you want.
This determines what data is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon just under the “Examining Edit Commands” section heading.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to cut.
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
3. Press Ô+X (Mac) or Ctrl+X (PC) or choose Edit➪Cut from the main
menu.
The selection is placed on the Clipboard.

Examining Edit Commands
408
If you select only part of a region to cut, Pro Tools creates new regions,
basing them on the new region arrangement for the track. For example, if you
choose a part of a region within the entire region, you end up with three new
regions listed in the Audio Regions list:
✦The portion to the left of the selection
✦The cut selection that no longer resides in the track’s playlist and now
sits on the Clipboard instead
✦The material to the right of the cut selection
Using the Copy command
The Copy command in Pro Tools functions just like it does in any computer
software Copy function: The selected material is copied to the Clipboard. To
copy a selection, follow these steps:
1. Click and hold the Track View selector (located in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and drag down the list to choose the track
view you want to edit.
This determines the data that is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon just under the “Examining Edit Commands” section heading.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to copy.
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu or press Ô+C (Mac) or 
Ctrl+C (PC).
The selection is placed on the Clipboard. And, if you’re not dealing with the
entire region, a new region corresponding to your selection is created in
the Audio Regions list.
Clearing selections
In Pro Tools, using the Clear command removes the selected material from a
track without putting it in the Clipboard and without adding a region to the
Audio Regions list corresponding to the selection you cleared. To clear a
selection, do the following:
1. Choose the Waveform Track view if you want to clear all the data
from the selection (or choose the Automation Parameters view if you
only want to clear from that parameter). To select a track view, click
and hold the track view selector (located in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window) and drag down the list.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Examining Edit Commands
409
This determines the data that is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon just under the “Examining Edit Commands” section heading.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to copy.
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
3. Choose Edit➪Clear from the main menu or press Ô+B (Mac) or 
Ctrl+B (PC).
The selection is cleared from your session.
If you clear only part of the region, Pro Tools creates new regions from the
remaining material in the region.
Performing a paste
When you paste a selection, the pasted material comes from the Clipboard,
the result of a Copy or a Cut command. To paste a selection, do the following:
1. With the Selector tool, place your cursor where you want to paste the
material in the appropriate track.
If you want the selection to be right at the start or end point of a region,
you can move the cursor to the right or left to put it there:
• Press Tab to move the cursor to the right.
• Press Option+Tab (Mac) or Ctrl+Tab (PC) to move the cursor to the left.
2. Press Ô+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (PC) or choose Edit➪Paste from the main
menu.
The material on the Clipboard is placed at the selection point.
If you paste a selection at an Edit Insert point (putting the cursor at a single
point) in Shuffle mode, the material to the right of the cursor slides over to
the end of the pasted section. If you paste into a selected section of the
track, the pasted material replaces the selected material.
Using the Duplicate command
Using the Duplicate command in Pro Tools is essentially the same as copying
and then pasting the start point of the selection right after the end point of
the copied section. Duplicate makes quick work of creating loops. To dupli-
cate a selection:
1. Select the region or part of the region you want to duplicate.
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.

Examining Edit Commands
410
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate from the main menu or press Ô+D (Mac) or
Ctrl+D (PC).
The selection is copied and pasted at the End point.
If you want to construct loops, make sure that you set the main time scale of
your session to Bars:Beats. Also, use the Selector tool to drag your selection;
or if you’d rather type in a specific value, type in the number of bars or beats
in the start and end points in the Event Edit area. This ensures that your
selection is duplicated and placed in the proper time location. Using the
Grabber tool might result in the material moving by a few samples in one
direction or another.
Performing a repeat
If you want to duplicate a selection more than once (when creating looped
sections, for instance), you can use the Repeat command. The Repeat command
works the same way as the Duplicate command except that when you choose
Edit➪Repeat from the main menu (or press Option+R, Mac or Alt+R, PC), the
Repeat dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-22, where you can enter the
number of times you want to repeat the Paste part of the procedure.
Each repeated selection is placed immediately after the previous one.

 Getting to know the Smart tool
 Fixing waveforms
 Silencing regions
 Using processing plug-ins
 Performing fades and crossfades
A
side from the basic editing methods — the ones I describe in the first
three chapters of this mini-book — Pro Tools offers some extra goodies
that can make the editing process easier. And what might I mean by goodies? In
this particular case, I’m talking about the aptly named Smart tool, the Pencil
tool, processing plug-ins, fades, and crossfades. This chapter lays out these
tools and helps turn you into a Pro Tools editing pro (or at least an informed
amateur).
Signing On to the Smart Tool
The Smart tool in Pro Tools is, well, smart. This tool consists of three tools I
describe in Chapter 3 in this mini-book — the Trimmer, the Selector, and the
Grabber. But the Smart Tool is more than just these three tools. The Smart tool
actually changes how it works, depending on what you try to do with it. For
example, if you place the cursor close to the start or end point of a region, the
Trimmer tool is activated. And if you place the cursor somewhere else within
the region, the Selector or the Grabber appears, depending on where you put the
cursor.
To use the Smart tool, click the button located under the Selector tool in the
Edit window, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Signing On to the Smart Tool
412
Using the Smart tool in Waveform view
When you’re using the Smart tool with a track set to Waveform view, each
Edit tool in the Smart tool set (Trimmer, Selector, Grabber) becomes active
according to where you place the cursor in the region. (See Book II, Chapter 4
for more on setting your view to Waveform view.) While you’re in Waveform
view, you can also perform fades and crossfades. This section details each 
of these editing tools and/or techniques.
Trimmer tool
To activate the Trimmer tool when you’re in the Smart tool mode, position
your cursor near the start or end point of the region you want to work with.
The Trimmer cursor appears, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can trim or extend
a region by clicking and dragging the start or end point to the left or right.
Selector tool
You enable the Selector tool when you’re in the Smart tool mode by positioning
your cursor in the upper half of the region, as shown in Figure 4-3. When you
see the Selector cursor, you can drag across the region to make a selection.

Grabber tool
When you place the cursor in the lower half of a region — but not near the
start or end point — you enable the Grabber tool, as shown in Figure 4-4. To
grab the region, click it when the Grabber cursor appears. You can then drag
the region to another place.
Fading in or out
Fade-ins and fade-outs are editing techniques by which you make the volume
of the region increase from silence or decrease to silence, respectively. These
techniques are useful when you want to eliminate abrupt changes in sound,
such as clicks, when a region starts or ends. You can use the Smart tool to
perform a fade-in or fade-out by placing the cursor in the upper corner of the
region near the start point (for a fade-in) or the end point (for a fade-out) and
waiting until the Fade icon appears, as shown in Figure 4-5. Then you can
select the Fade length by dragging your cursor to the right (to fade in) or left
(to fade out). (For more on fade-ins and fade-outs, see the “Performing Fades
and Crossfades” section, later in this chapter.)

Creating crossfades
A crossfade occurs when the volume of the first of two adjacent regions
decreases to silence while the second of these two regions increases from
silence. This smoothes the transition going from one region to another. You
can create a crossfade between two adjacent regions by placing the cursor
at the bottom corner where the two regions adjoin and waiting until the
Crossfade icon appears, as shown in Figure 4-6. After the icon appears, you
can drag to the left or right to set the crossfade length. (The “Performing
Fades and Crossfades” section, later in this chapter, has more on crossfades.)
Using the Smart tool in Automation view
To add to the versatility of the Smart tools (outlined in the previous sections),
each tool in the set — Trimmer, Selector, and Grabber — performs differently
when you have a track set to one of the Automation views (Volume, Panning,
Mute, and Send Levels). (Book II, Chapter 4 has more on track views; Book VI,
Chapter 6 has more on automating a mix.)
Automating the Trimmer tool
To select a region in one of the Automation views with the Smart version of
the Trimmer tool, position your cursor in the top 25 percent of the region.
The Trimmer icon appears, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can move your cursor

up and down to change the automation value or to create breakpoints (places
where changes occur in the automation curves). If you want finer control of
the Trimmer tool and your work, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) after you begin
trimming.
Automating the Selector tool
To use the Selector tool in Smart mode when you have one of the Automation
views set for a track, position your cursor in the lower 75 percent of the region,
as shown in Figure 4-8. You can then make your selection.
Automating the Grabber tool
To use the Smart version of the Grabber tool in a track set to one of the
Automation views, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) with your cursor placed in the
region, as shown in Figure 4-9.
You can use the Grabber tool in several different ways when you have a
track set to an Automation view. Here are two especially handy ways:
✦Editing existing breakpoints: Just position the cursor near one of these
points, and the Grabber magically appears. You can increase the resolution
of your movements to fine control by pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) after
you start moving the breakpoint.

✦Constraining the Grabber vertically: To keep the Grabber from moving
right or left, press Shift — or, if you set the tool to fine control, press
Ô+Shift (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift (PC).
Perusing the Pencil Tool
In spite of all your effort to keep from creating any of the digital distortions
known as overs — also referred to as clipping — you might have one pop
through even now and then. No worries; use the Pencil tool to redraw the
waveform and get rid that nasty critter. (Is that cool, or what?) You can also
use the Pencil tool to remove other unwanted pops or clicks that show up in
your precious tracks.
The Pencil tool, as shown here in the margin, is active only when you zoom
way into a waveform, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Using the Pencil tool to redraw a waveform is a destructive act; it changes
your original audio file permanently. Before you redraw, make a copy of the
original region (using the Duplicate function under the AudioSuite menu) so
you don’t lose the good stuff in the original file. The next section tells you
precisely how to do that.
Creating a copy of the original file
I strongly recommend making a copy of a region before you edit it with the
Pencil tool. (See the Warning icon in the previous section.) Here’s how to do
just that:

1. Select the region you want to work on.
2. Choose AudioSuite➪Other➪Duplicate from the main menu.
The Duplicate dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-11.
3. Enable the Use in Playlist option on the right, and make sure that
Playlist is chosen in the top-center field.
4. Click the Process button (lower right).
You now have a copy of the original region that’s put in the track in
place of the original. (The original still resides in the Audio Regions list.)
Using the Pencil tool to redraw a waveform
To redraw a waveform (after you make a copy of it — see the previous sec-
tion for why), follow these steps:
1. Find the area in the region that you want to edit.
2. With the Zoom tool, repeatedly click the spot you want to edit until
you get into the sample level.
The waveform looks like a single wavy line. (Refer to Figure 4-10.)
3. Select the Pencil tool.
4. Locate the exact spot to edit.
Your target, typically a moment of distorted sound, is usually easy to see
because it looks like a sharp peak in the waveform. (See the left side of
Figure 4-12.) If it isn’t apparent, you might need to adjust the horizontal
until you can see it clearly. (For more on adjusting the horizontal zoom,
see Book II, Chapter 4.)
If you have trouble seeing the problem, use the Scrub tool to listen to
the audio.
5. Draw over the waveform to round over the spot that was chopped off
when the note got clipped. (See the right side of Figure 4-12.)
Take it easy when making changes to the waveform. All you want to do is
smooth out the peak — not change the sound too much.

Silencing Selections

Silencing Selections
Pro Tools offers a couple of ways to manage silence in selections: You can strip
silence from regions to reduce the size of your audio files, and you can insert
silence into regions where you don’t want any sound. I cover both of these
options in the following sections.
Stripping silence
Using the Strip Silence command allows you to take a selection that meets a
minimum sound level and silence it. This divides the region that the silence
was stripped from into smaller regions. This lets you isolate sound effects or
musical passages so that you can quantize them or locate them at specific
synch points within your session. (Check out Chapter 3 in this mini-book for
more on synch points.) Stripping silence from regions also allows you to com-
pact your audio file farther than you could if you didn’t strip the low-volume
parts to silence. (See the “Compacting a file” section, later in this chapter.)
This technique saves hard drive space by making your audio files smaller.
Understanding the Strip Silence window
Whenever you use the Strip Silence command (see the following section), a
window opens (see Figure 4-13) where you can set the parameters under
which the silence will be stripped from a region. These parameters include
✦Strip Threshold slider: This setting determines the signal level below
which the audio is silenced.
✦Min(imum) Strip Duration slider: This parameter makes sure that if you
have a really small section that falls below the threshold, you don’t end up
with a ton of sections where silence was stripped and didn’t need to be.
✦Region Start Pad slider: This parameter adds a specified amount of time
to the beginning of each region created when you use the Strip Silence
command.

✦Region End Pad slider: This parameter is essentially the same as the
previous one except that it adds time after the end of a region stripped
from silence.
✦Strip button: This performs the strip function and clears everything
within the “silence” threshold determined by your settings in this
window.
✦Rename button: Clicking this button opens the Rename Selected
Regions dialog box (see Figure 4-14), where you choose how new regions
are named after silence has been stripped.
✦Extract button: This parameter strips the audio specified in the strip silence
settings and leaves the rest. This is the opposite effect of stripping the
silence and leaving the audio. This is handy for keeping ambient noise so
you can use it somewhere else. For example, if you want to replace a drum
part, you can pre-record the drum and mix it in with the ambient noise to
match the basic sound of the original track.
✦Separate button: This separates the regions created by the strip silence
command. Each section of audio resides in its own region.

Using the Strip Silence command
To strip silence from audio regions, follow these steps:
1. Select a region or part of a region.
Chapter 2 in this mini-book has more on making selections.
2. Choose Window➪Show Strip Silence from the main menu.
The Strip Silence window opens. (Refer to Figure 4-13.)
3. Click the Rename button to set your region name preferences.
4. Adjust the parameter sliders until rectangles appear in the region and
any material you want to remove resides outside the rectangles, as
shown in Figure 4-15.
This might take some time. If you want to increase the resolution of the
sliders, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) while you move them.
5. When you have the rectangles where you want them, click the Strip
button in the Strip Silence window.
Any part of the region not in the rectangles is removed; each rectangled
section then becomes a new region, using the naming scheme that you
choose in the Rename dialog box.
Inserting silence
If you’re like most people, you keep the session rolling — even when you
don’t play anything during certain passages — to keep the feel happening
throughout the tune. In this case, it’s not uncommon to have passages where
pretty much nothing is recorded (well, except for maybe a cough or a chair
squeak). Rather than cutting those sections from your track, you can insert
silence into those sections instead. With the Insert Silence command, you
can quickly and easily put silence anywhere you want within a track.

Inserting silence into tracks works differently for each Edit mode. This can
often prove confusing, so to help you keep things straight, I not only show
you how to insert silence, but also let you know what conditions apply when
you use the different Edit modes.
Inserting an amount of silence
You insert silence into a track with the following steps:
1. With the Selector tool, select the part of a region that you want to
silence; then click and drag across the section of the region that you
want to select.
2. Choose Edit➪Insert Silence from the main menu or press Shift+Ô+E
(Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+E (PC).
The selected section is silenced.
Understanding the results
When you’re using the Insert Silence command, each Edit mode treats certain
conditions differently. The difference depends on the mode in use at the time:
✦Shuffle mode: If the track(s) you selected is set to Waveform view, all
audio and automation data is cleared, and all subsequent regions are
shuffled the amount of the silence.
✦Slip mode: If the track(s) you selected is set to Waveform view, all audio
and automation data is cleared. On the other hand, if your track is set to
one of the Automation views, only the data from that view is removed.
✦Grid mode: All audio and automation data is cleared. This is essentially
the same as using the clear command; see Chapter 3 in this mini-book.
All the regions stay where they are in the session when the silence is
inserted.
Performing Fades and Crossfades
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you use fade-ins and fade-outs to make
the volume of the region increase from silence or decrease to silence,
respectively. Both techniques are useful when you want to eliminate abrupt
changes in sound, such as clicks, when a region starts or ends. A crossfade
combines of a fade-out and a fade-in that happens at the junction of two
adjacent regions to make a smooth transition between these two regions.

Performing Fades and Crossfades
422
You can create fade-ins, fade-outs, and crossfades faster and easier than ever
before in Pro Tools. You can use fades to bring regions in and out of a mix or
to make a seamless transition from one adjoining region to another. One of
the key aspects of fades is creating a curve (how the fade happens) that fits
the material you want to fade. Pro Tools gives you many options for shaping
your curves.
Dealing with the Fades dialog box
Whatever kind of fade you create — fade-in, fade-out, or crossfade — you
make the fade from the settings in the Fades dialog box. You access the
Fades dialog box by choosing Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu. After
you get the dialog box up on your computer screen (as shown in Figure
4-16), you can adjust the following parameters to meet your needs:
✦Audition: Clicking this button plays the fade or crossfade so that you
can hear what your settings will sound like.
✦View First Track: Pro Tools lets you select more than one track to cross-
fade at one time. (The crossfade, however, takes place on each track and
not across tracks.) The View First Track button allows you to view and
audition the first of the tracks selected.
✦View Second Track: In a selection that includes more than one track,
this button shows you the second track. If you have more than two
tracks selected, you can’t view beyond the second.
✦View Both Tracks: Clicking this button lets you view and audition both
tracks selected for crossfading.
✦Fade Curves Only: Enabling this button shows the fade curves but not
the waveforms for the audio you want to fade or crossfade.
✦Fade Curves and Separate Waveforms: This button lets you see both
the fade curves and the waveforms for each track. The fade-out wave-
form shows up above the fade in waveform.
✦Fade Curves and Superimposed Waveforms: This button superimposes
the two waveforms one on top of the other and shows the fade curves.
✦Fade Curves and Summed Waveform: This button shows the fade
curves and a single waveform depicting the sum of both original wave-
forms. Being able to see the sum of both waveforms makes it easier to
see the overall volume of the audio.
✦Zoom In: The Zoom In button increases the visual height of the waveforms.
You can return to the default setting by Ô-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl-clicking
(PC).

✦Zoom Out: Clicking the Zoom Out button decreases the visual height of
the waveform. Ô-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (PC) returns the view to
the default setting.
✦Out Shape settings: Here, select the shape of the fade out curve. You
have three options:
• Standard: This setting uses a basic fade-out shape that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and then dragging the curve how you want it.

• S-Curve: This setting creates an S-shaped curve that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and then dragging to the shape you want —
well, as long as it’s an S shape.
• Presets: Clicking here presents you with a drop-down menu contain-
ing seven preset curves for you to choose from, as shown in Figure
4-17. You can change a preset by clicking one of the end points and
dragging it.
✦Link settings: You have the following three choices on how you want the
fade-out and fade-in curves of your crossfades to relate to one another:
• Equal Power: This option keeps the relative volume of the Fade Out
and Fade In regions the same. This selection is best for material that
differs greatly in sound character, such as the fading out of one
instrument and the fading in of another.
• Equal Gain: This setting keeps the Fade In and Fade Out selections
from summing together and overloading the track, resulting in clipping
(distortion). This setting is best used for selections that have the
same relative volume and phase, such as one drum loop to another.
• None: This setting leaves the two fades independent of one another.
This gives you more flexibility to create unique fades. If you want to
edit the Fade In curve only, press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while you
drag the curve. To adjust the Fade Out only, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl
(PC) while you drag the curve.
✦Use Dither: Selecting this option applies dither — a way to improve the
sound of very quiet material. (Book VII, Chapter 2 has more on dither.)
You don’t need this check box selected if you crossfade fairly loud mate-
rial, but it’s a good idea if the audio is quiet.

✦In Shape settings: Here, select the shape of the Fade In curve. Like with
Out Shape setting, you have these options:
• Standard: This setting uses a basic fade-in shape that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and then dragging the curve how you want.
• S-Curve: This setting creates an S-shaped, fade-in curve that you can
adjust by clicking the curve and then dragging it to the shape you
want (as long as it’s an S shape).
• Presets: As you might have guessed, you can choose from seven
preset curves here, which are mirror images of the curves found in
the Out Shape Presets menu. You can change them by clicking one of
the end points and dragging it.
Creating crossfades
The three types of crossfades are centered, pre, and post. These different
flavors — and the actual process of creating a crossfade — are covered in
the following sections.
Creating a centered crossfade
A centered crossfade, the most common type of crossfade, is great for when
the material in the two regions fits well together, such as with two different
takes of a lead vocal part that end up being your final vocal track. Centered
crossfades are fades where the crossfade happens evenly between the two
regions, incorporating audio on both sides of two regions’ splice points (where
they meet). For this type of crossfade to work, you need audio data after the
end point of the first region and before the start point of the second region.
To create a center crossfade, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, drag from the point where you want the cross-
fade to start (in the first region) to where you want the crossfade to
end (in the second region), as shown in Figure 4-18.
Figure 4-18:

Selector
tool to drag
across
where you
want the
crossfade.

Performing Fades and Crossfades
426
2. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu or press Ô+F (Mac)
or Ctrl+F (PC).
The Fades dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
3. Enter your crossfade preferences in the Fades dialog box as listed in
the earlier section, “Dealing with the Fades dialog box.”
Make adjustments to the view, the Fade In and Fade Out curves, and the
Link option — auditioning the crossfade periodically as you go — until
you have the crossfade you want.
4. When you’re happy with the sound of the crossfade, click OK.
Your crossfade is calculated. You can change the duration of the fade by
trimming it; see the “Trimming a crossfade” section later in this chapter.
Creating a pre-crossfade
A pre-crossfade happens before the start point of the second region, as shown
in Figure 4-19. This is a good type of crossfade to use when you have an initial
attack (a cymbal crash, for example) that happens right at the start point of
the second region. In this example, if the second region isn’t at full volume
when the crash happens, you lose the impact of the cymbal. The pre-crossfade
ensures that you get the full impact of the cymbal. For this crossfade to work,
audio data has to be in place before the start point of the second region.
Follow these steps to create a pre-crossfade:
1. With the Selector tool, click in the region at the point where you want
the pre-crossfade to begin.
2. Shift-drag or press Shift+Tab to select to the end of the region.
3. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu or press Ô+F (Mac)
or Ctrl+F (PC).
The Fades dialog box makes its appearance. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)

4. Choose your Fade settings and audition them, adjusting the settings as
you go until you have the fade that you want.
5. Click OK.
The fade is created.
Creating a post-crossfade
A post-crossfade happens after the end of the first region, as shown in Figure
4-20. This type of crossfade is useful for when you have a sound that continues
all the way up to the end of the first region (to keep the drum theme going: a
hi-hat note, for instance) and you want to make sure that the last hi-hat 
doesn’t drop off in volume while it’s being hit. This type of crossfade works
only if the first region contains audio data after its end point.
Follow these steps to create a post-crossfade:
1. With the Selector tool, click in the region at the point where you want
the fade to end.
2. Shift-drag or press Shift+Option+Tab (Mac) or Shift+Alt+Tab (PC) to
select back to the region’s start point.
3. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu or press Ô+F (Mac)
or Ctrl+F (PC) to open the Fades dialog box. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
4. Choose your fade settings and audition them, adjusting the settings as
you go until you have the fade you want.
5. Click OK.
The fade is created.
Removing a crossfade
To remove a crossfade, select the crossfade with the Grabber tool and then
press Delete (Mac) or Backspace (PC). You can also choose Edit➪Fades➪
Delete from the main menu.

Trimming a crossfade
Here’s how to change the boundaries of a crossfade:
1. Select the crossfade by double-clicking with the Selector tool or by
grabbing with the Grabber tool.
2. With the Trimmer tool, click and drag either side of the crossfade.
Fading in and out
A fade-in happens when you make the volume of the region increase from
silence to smooth the transition into the region. Comparatively, a fade-out is
a decrease in volume that’s useful when you want to smooth the transition
leaving a region. These types of fades are often used when you have accent
parts that come and go in the song — keyboard or guitar licks that counter-
point the lead vocal, for instance — and you want them to seamlessly flow in
and out of the song. Without a fade into or out of the region, you might hear
abrupt changes in the sound because of the background noise in those parts.
You can fade a single region in or out via the Fades dialog box. Creating these
fades saves you the trouble of performing automation curves to fade in or
out. (Of course, you can still do that, but it does use more of your computer’s
processing power. I explain the process in Book VI, Chapter 6.)
Fading in to the beginning of a region
To fade in to a single region, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, select the beginning of the region you want to
fade into.
To make this process work, you have to begin your selection point
before (or at) the start point — not after it.
2. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu or press Ô+F (Mac)
or Ctrl+F (PC).
The Fades dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
3. Choose your parameters in the dialog box and audition the fade,
making adjustments to the settings until you get the fade to sound how
you want.
4. Click OK.
The fade is created, and the Fade curve appears in the selected region.
You can also fade in without opening the Fades dialog box. When you do this,
Pro Tools uses the setting you select in the Fades menu.

2. Press Control+D (Mac) or Windows+D (PC) or select Edit➪Fades➪Fade
To Start from the main menu.
The Fade is created, and the curve appears in the selected region.
Fading out at the end of a region
To fade out from a single region, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, select the beginning of the region you want to
fade.
Your selection point needs to stop after or at the end point — not before
it — for this process to work.
2. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the main menu or press Ô+F (Mac)
or Ctrl+F (PC).
The Fades dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
3. Choose your parameters in the dialog box and audition the fade,
making adjustments to the settings until you get the fade to sound how
you want.
4. Click OK.
The fade is created, and the Fade curve appears in the selected region.
You can also fade out without opening the Fades dialog box. When you do
this, Pro Tools uses the setting you select in the Fades menu.

2. Press Ctrl+G (Mac) or Windows+G (PC) or select Edit➪Fades➪Fade To
End from the main menu.
The Fade is created, and the curve appears in the selected region.
Creating batch fades
You can create more than one fade at a time by using the Batch Fades command
and selecting multiple regions at a time.
Here’s the way to create batch fades:
1. With the Selector tool, choose the first region you want to fade.
2. Click and drag across the regions you want to include in the batch.
Make sure that the entire last region that you want to fade is selected, as
shown in Figure 4-23.
3. Press Ô+F (Mac) or Ctrl+F (PC) or choose Edit➪Fades➪Create from the
main menu.
The Batch Fades dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-24.
4. In the Batch Fades dialog box, choose your In Shape and Out Shape,

5. Click OK.
The fades are calculated.
You can trim or extend each of the fades later.
Cleaning Up Your Session
After you finish all your editing, you probably have a ton of regions in your
Audio Regions list. Things can get cluttered up pretty quick, so before I start
mixing the song, I like to clean up my session by consolidating regions, getting
rid of any unused regions, and compacting the regions that I want to use. Doing
these things makes it easier to deal with the regions in the session and frees
up hard drive space. It can also make playing the tracks easier on your hard
drive, depending on how many tracks you have in your session.
Consolidating selections
You can consolidate regions that make up a section of a song by using the
Consolidate command. In effect, you take a bunch of regions — for instance,
the various assembled takes of your guitar part that create the parts for a
song’s verse — and make them into one region. This makes moving or copying
this section easier and also makes for a less cluttered track playlist.
Figure 4-24:
Use the
Batch Fades
dialog box

at a time.

Cleaning Up Your Session
432
To consolidate selections, follow these steps:
1. Select the regions you want to consolidate using either the Selector
tool or the Grabber tool. Or, if you want to select all the regions in the
track, triple-click anywhere in the track’s playlist.
2. Choose Edit➪Consolidate from the main menu or press
Option+Shift+3 (Mac) or Alt+Shift+3 (PC).
The selected regions are replaced by a new region, which contains all
the audio from the selection, including any muted regions.
Automation data is not consolidated. If you have regions that you want to
consolidate and you want to keep any automation data at all, your best bet is
to do a bounce procedure for that selection. (I cover bounce procedures in
Book VI, Chapter 7.)
Removing unused regions
You can easily get rid of any regions that are not being used in your session.
Here’s how:
1. Open the Audio Regions drop-down menu by clicking and holding the
Audio Regions title at the top of the Audio Regions list located on the
right side of the Edit window.
2. Choose Select➪Unused in the Audio Regions List drop-down menu or
press Shift+Ô+U (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+U (PC).
All regions in the list that aren’t included in any tracks in the session are
highlighted.
3. Choose Clear Selected from the Audio Regions list drop-down menu.
The Clear Regions dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-25, asking
whether you want to remove the regions from the session or delete the
audio files from your hard drive. Choose the option you prefer.

Cleaning Up Your Session
433
Removing the regions from your present session ensures that you have the
region to use in another session, but it won’t reduce the amount of stuff on
your hard drive. If you want to free up space and know that you won’t use
the region in another session, delete it to save hard drive space.
Compacting a file
You can compact an audio file (make it smaller) by using the Compact
Selected command from the Audio Regions drop-down menu. Compacting an
audio file in Pro Tools deletes any audio data that’s not being used. This
reduces the amount of space taken up in your hard drive, which makes back-
ing up your data a quicker process.
Compacting an audio file is like taking all the pieces of tape that were cut
from reels of recorded tape and — gasp! — throwing them away. (Well, okay,
that’s what it would have been like in the days before digital audio.) My
point is that after you compact a file, you’re committed to the results. This is
one of the few editing tasks that you can do that you can’t undo afterward.
You want to compact an audio file only after you do all your editing and
you’re sure you don’t want any of the unused data. (You’re sure. Right?)
To compact a region, follow these steps:
1. From the Audio Regions list, choose the region(s) you want to compact.
2. Open the Audio Regions drop-down menu by clicking and holding the
Audio Regions title at the top of the Audio Regions list and then
choosing Compact.
The Compact Selected dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-26.
3. In the Padding field, enter the amount of padding you want on your
regions.
Padding is how much data on either side of the region’s start and end
points might contain fade information. If you have fades in the region,
set your padding amount to the length of the fade to ensure that your
fades still work.

A
s you can read in Book I, Chapter 4, working with Musical Instrument
Digital Interface (MIDI) lets you record performance data and add the
sounds later. This gives you some advantages over recording audio. First,
your MIDI tracks take up less room on your hard drive (not a big deal in
today’s world, but worth mentioning). Secondly — and the most compelling
reason for working with MIDI data — you can wait to choose the exact
sound you want from your performance. This lets you tweak the sound as
well as your performance. Of course, the drawback is that you can easily
spend more time than you need when trying different options.
The MIDI capabilities in Pro Tools are not as sophisticated as some other
programs, such as Sonar or Logic. This has its advantages for all but the
most discerning MIDI power-user because you can get started creating
music without a lot of fuss.
In this chapter, I walk you through setting up your system and session to
record MIDI in Pro Tools. Along the way, you discover how to set up your
devices, create MIDI tracks, and enable them for recording. You also get a
chance to create a click track to play along with, which makes editing MIDI
faster and easier.
Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
Setting up your MIDI device varies, according to whether you use a Mac or a
PC. Either way, though, setting up a MIDI device takes only a couple of min-
utes. Enabling MIDI devices is as easy as adding a printer to your system.
The following sections walk you through what you need for each platform.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
438
Enabling MIDI devices in Mac OS X
Before you can record MIDI in Mac OS X, you need to do three things:
1. Set up your MIDI devices in OS X.
2. Enable the MIDI channels.
This lets you choose the MIDI channels that each device receives and
sends data on.
3. Enable the input devices in Pro Tools.
That way, you can actually use those devices in Pro Tools.
To configure your MIDI devices in OS X, follow these steps:
1. With your MIDI cables, connect the devices you want to use with 
Pro Tools to either the Digidesign hardware or to a separate MIDI
interface.
2. Click the Audio MIDI Setup icon (as shown in the margin) on the Dock.
If this icon isn’t showing, go to Applications➪Utilities➪Audio MIDI
Setup.
The Audio MIDI Setup window opens.
3. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
A message appears that tells you your system is being scanned. 
After the scan is complete, your MIDI interface should appear in the
tab’s window, along with any devices connected to it, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.

The Audio MIDI Setup window opens. (Refer to Figure 1-1.)
2. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
All MIDI devices connected to your MIDI interface should appear in the
tab’s window.
3. Double-click the device for which you want to activate MIDI channels.
The Device window appears.
4. Click the More Properties tab to expand the window.
The window expands to include Basic and Expert tabs containing set-
tings you can make to your device.
5. Click the Basic tab.
6. In the Transmits and Receives section of the Basics tab, click the chan-
nel number(s) through which you want to transmit and receive data.
Blue highlighted channels are active.

Tools offers, this option can be very handy. (For more on using inputs, see
Chapter 2 in this mini-book.)
If you use any control surfaces (such as a Mackie Control) or if you want to
sync your system to another using MMC (MIDI machine control), you must
enable the devices for these tasks in the MIDI Input Enable dialog box, along
with your other MIDI devices.
To enable input devices in Pro Tools, follow these steps:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Devices from the main menu. 
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, displaying all the MIDI ports in
your system, as shown in Figure 1-2.
2. Select the check boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.
Enabling MIDI devices in Windows XP
This section details how to setup your MIDI devices in Windows XP. At the
time of this writing, Windows Vista is not yet supported.
Here’s how to configure MIDI devices in Windows XP:
1. Install the drivers for your MIDI device as described in the device’s
manual.
If you use the MIDI ports in your Digidesign interface, this step was done
when you installed the software, as I describe in Book II, Chapter 1.
2. With your MIDI cables, connect the devices you want to use with 
Pro Tools to either the Digidesign hardware or to a separate MIDI
interface.

3. Turn on the power for the device.
Your device should show up in your MIDI tracks’ Input and Output selec-
tor drop-down menus. If not, restart your computer. If this still doesn’t
work, you may need to go into the Device Driver menu and manually
move the driver for your device into the Device Driver folder.
To enable input devices in Pro Tools, the steps are just like those you’d use
for a Mac:
1. Choose Setup➪MIDI➪Input Devices from the main menu.
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, showing the MIDI ports in your
system.
2. Select the check boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.
Running MIDI Thru
MIDI Thru allows you to hear what your MIDI instrument is playing while the
track it’s assigned to is record-enabled. Pro Tools also lets you set up a
default MIDI Thru instrument, so you don’t have to choose a device each
time you enable a MIDI track. Pro Tools uses the designated MIDI Thru
instrument automatically.
To enable MIDI Thru, all you have to do is choose Options➪MIDI Thru from
the main menu.
When you enable MIDI Thru, you also need to disable Local Control in each
of your devices to keep them from receiving double messages and creating
stuck notes (notes that continue playing indefinitely). This is done within
each of your MIDI devices. Consult your device’s manual for details on how
to do this.
If you do end up with some stuck notes, choose Event➪All MIDI Notes Off from
the main menu or press Ô+Shift+. (period; Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+. (period; PC).
Here’s how to set the default MIDI Thru instrument:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box opens.
2. Click the MIDI tab, as shown in Figure 1-3.

3. Choose the MIDI device — as well as the channel you want to use to
play the MIDI data — from the Default Thru Instrument drop-down
menu.
4. Click OK.
Managing the MIDI Input filter
Use the MIDI Input filter to ignore certain MIDI data while recording. For
example, you can have Pro Tools ignore after-touch (extra pressure you place
on the keyboard keys to change the sound that’s playing) or pitch bend
(raising or lowering the pitch as the note plays) messages when you record 
a drum part using your keyboard. This can be handy if you want to avoid
recording system exclusive data — that is, messages that are exclusive to the
device and not related to performance information — when recording a MIDI
performance.
To set the MIDI Input Filter parameters, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪MIDI➪Input Filter from the main menu.
The MIDI Input Filter dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-4.
2. Select the Record options:
• All: Selecting All means that Pro Tools will record all the MIDI mes-
sages received.

• Only: Selecting Only means that only the parameters that you select
in upcoming Step 3 are recorded.
• All Except: Selecting All Except sets your system to record all the
MIDI data it receives except for the check boxes that you select in
upcoming Step 3.
3. Depending on the mode you chose (see Step 2), select the check boxes
in the Channel Info and Controllers sections that correspond to what
you want to include or exclude from the recording process.
4. Depending on the choice you made in Step 2 and whether you want to
include any system-exclusive data in your recording, select or clear
the System Exclusive check box.
• If you choose All in Step 2: Selecting or clearing this check box doesn’t
matter because system-exclusive data is recorded either way.
• If you choose Only in Step 2: Selecting this check box means that
system exclusive data is recorded.
• If you choose All Except in Step 2: Selecting this check box means that
system-exclusive data is not recorded.
5. Click OK.
Quantizing your inputs
You can have Pro Tools automatically quantize your performance — that is,
adjust the position of each note’s timing so that it fits within a specified time
frame. This can be useful if you want the timing of your performance to fit a
selected grid exactly.
Figure 1-4:
Choose
MIDI

to record
along with
your per-
formance
data.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
444
Be careful with quantizing. Stop short of doing too much because sucking
the life out of a performance is very easy.
To quantize your input, follow these steps:
1. Choose Event➪MIDI➪Input Quantize from the main menu.
The Input Quantize dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-5.
2. Select the Enable Input Quantize check box to quantize and enter the
rest of the options/parameters in the dialog box.
Here’s a rundown on what each of these parameters mean:
From the What to Quantize section, choose the part of the note to 
quantize:
• Attacks: This check box sets the quantization to the start of the
selected notes.
With Attacks selected, using the Preserve Note Duration option
keeps the end of the note intact.
• Releases: Selecting this check box quantizes the ends of the notes.
With Releases selected, the start of the note is left intact.
If both Attacks and Releases are selected, the Preserve Note Duration
option is dimmed.
• Preserve Note Duration: Selecting this check box produces different
results depending on whether you choose Attacks or Releases.

The Quantize Grid section is where you choose the resolution of the
quantize grid, from whole notes to 64th notes.
• Note Selector: From this drop-down menu, choose the note value of
your quantize grid. Click the note to select it.
• Tuplet: Select this check box to select odd note groupings, such as
triplets. When you enable this option, you need to fill in the tuplet
value. For example, to create a regular eighth-note triplet, choose 3
in Time 1; for a quarter-note triplet, choose 3 in Time 2.
• Offset Grid By: This field lets you move the quantize grid forward or
backward by the selected number of ticks. This is helpful for creating
grooves that lie slightly ahead or behind the beat.
• Randomize: This option adds a level of randomness to the quantizing
of your selection. This can further help with keeping your rhythm
from being too rigid. You can select values from 0–100%. Lower
values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.
In the Options section, you can include other options with your quantize
operation, including
• Swing: Select this check box to create a swing (a dotted quarter-
eighth note triplet) feel. Use the slider to specify a percentage (from
0 to 300), with 100% being a triplet feel.
• Include Within: Selecting this check box only quantizes the notes that
fall within the boundaries created with this setting. Your setting
ranges are from 0–100%, with the smaller number affecting the nar-
rower range of notes.
• Exclude Within: Selecting Exclude Within allows you to exclude any
notes within the boundaries set in this field. Like with Include Within,
you can set your boundaries from 0–100%.
• Strength: This is, in my opinion, the most useful function in the Pro
Tool’s quantize operation. Enabling this check box allows you to
move your quantized notes by a percentage rather than just snap-
ping them right to the grid. Your setting range runs from 0–100%,
with the higher numbers keeping more strictly to the grid than 
lower values.
3. Press Return/Enter to close the window.
Offsetting MIDI tracks
Pro Tools lets you offset your MIDI tracks to be a specified amount of time 
in your session. This can be especially handy if you record your MIDI track
while listening to your sound device through the Digidesign interface; you
may notice some delay (also called latency) in the sound. This delay is the
result of the time it takes the sound to travel through the interface, into the
computer, and then back out the interface to your speakers. Depending on

Getting Ready to Record
446
the Buffer setting you have in your session, this latency may be large enough
to bother you. (Book II, Chapter 3 has more on Buffer settings.)
The way around this problem is to offset your MIDI tracks by moving them
to a point earlier in your session by the amount of the delay. This makes Pro
Tools play the MIDI track(s) earlier so you can hear them on time.
To offset all your MIDI tracks, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box opens.
2. Click the MIDI tab.
Refer to Figure 1-3 to see the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
3. Enter a negative number equal to your H/W buffer setting in the
Global MIDI Playback Offset field.
This offset amount uses samples (the individual snapshots of the audio
in your session) as the unit of measure.
4. Click OK.
Your specified offset will compensate for the latency.
To offset a single track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Event➪MIDI Track Offsets from the main menu.
The MIDI Track Offsets window opens.
2. On the row for the track you want to offset, double-click the Sample
Offset column.
The field is highlighted.
3. Enter the offset value in the Sample Offset column.
A negative number moves the track to an earlier point in the session; a
positive number moves it later. Enter a value equal to the H/W buffer set-
ting (as described in Book II, Chapter 3).
4. Press Return/Enter to save the value and close the window.
Getting Ready to Record
Setting up MIDI and instrument tracks involves first creating the tracks for
your session and then setting the inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels for the
tracks you created. This section spells out how to do all these tasks.

Book V
Chapter 1

Creating MIDI and instrument tracks
Of course, before you can manipulate a MIDI track, you have to have one. To
create a new MIDI track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Tracks dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-6.
2. Enter the number of tracks you want to create.
3. Select MIDI Track or Instrument Track from the drop-down menu.
4. If you select an instrument track, you also need to choose between
Mono or Stereo.
If the plug-in you plan on using is a multichannel plug-in or if you intend
to have any stereo information on it, I suggest choosing Stereo.
5. Click Create.
Your new track(s) appear in both the Edit and the Mix windows.
When you create a new track, a default name is used — something not entirely
useful (like MIDI 1 or Inst 1). You can rename this track by following these steps:
1. Double-click the track name in the Edit window.
The track’s dialog box appears.
2. Type in the new name and add any comments about the track in the
appropriate fields.
3. Click OK to close the window.
Your track gets a (hopefully more helpful) new name.
Setting inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels
For MIDI and instrument tracks, like with audio tracks, you need to select the
input and output sources for your MIDI data to be able to record and play
Figure 1-6:
Use the New
Tracks dialog
box to create
new MIDI
and instru-

back your tracks. Where MIDI tracks differ from audio tracks is that you also
need to set the MIDI channel(s) through which the MIDI data for each track
travels. You can set the inputs and outputs for your MIDI tracks in either the
Edit or the Mix window. If you want to set these in the Edit window, make sure
that you set up the window so that it displays the Input and Output sections.
To view the Input and Output sections on a MIDI track, choose View➪Mix
Window➪I/O View. To see the MIDI Input and Output section for instruments
tracks, choose View➪Mix Window➪Instruments.
To set the input on a MIDI or instrument track, follow these steps:
1. Click the MIDI Input Selector drop-down menu.
You find the selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window
and above the track’s fader in the Mix window for MIDI tracks. In instru-
ment tracks, you can find the MIDI input/output selector controls at the
top of the track’s channel strip in the Mix window. In the Edit window, it
will be to the right of the main track selection controls.
2. Drag through the menu to the MIDI device and channel you want.
3. Release your mouse button.
To set the output for your MIDI track, follow these steps:
1. Click the MIDI Output Selector drop-down menu.
You find the selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window
and above the track’s fader in the Mix window.
2. Drag through the menu to the MIDI device and channel you want.
3. Release your mouse button.
With instrument tracks, you also need to choose a physical output to route
the audio signal created by your instrument track’s plug-in. Here’s how:
1. Click the Audio Output Selector drop-down menu.
You find the selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window
and above the track’s fader in the Mix window.
2. Drag through the menu to the output device (bus or hardware) and
channel you want.
3. Release your mouse button.
You can assign multiple destinations for your MIDI tracks by pressing
Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) when you select your input and output
assignments.

Any devices and MIDI channels that are already assigned to another track
are listed in bold letters. This makes it easy to keep from accidentally 
assigning two tracks to the same device and channels (although you can if
you want).
Creating a click track
Click tracks (a metronome to play to) are useful for making sure that your
performance data lines up with the bars and beats of your session. Having
your MIDI line up allows you to do a variety of editing tasks much faster and
more accurately.
To create a click track, you need to set a tempo and a meter and then enable
the click in the Transport window. I cover the steps for these procedures in
the following sections.
Setting the tempo
To set the tempo and meter of your session, or a section within your ses-
sion, do the following:
1. Disengage the Tempo Ruler Enable button in the expanded Transport
window. If the Tempo Ruler Enable button isn’t showing in the
Transport window, choose View➪Transport➪Expanded.
The little Conductor guy turns gray. If it’s already gray, leave it alone.
2. Double-click in the Tempo box in the expanded section of the
Transport window.
3. Type the tempo number you want and then press Return/Enter.
Your tempo is set.
Another way to change the tempo is to follow Step 1 in the preceding list and
then click and drag the slider located below the Tempo setting (see Figure
1-7) left or right to get to the tempo you want. Release your mouse button
when you get the correct tempo.
Choosing the meter
You can set the meter for the session by doing the following:
Figure 1-7:
Change the
tempo here.

Getting Ready to Record
450
1. Double-click the Meter button in the expanded Transport window or
choose Window➪Show Tempo/Meter from the main menu.
Check out Book II, Chapter 4 for more on expanding the Transport
window.
The Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears.
2. Choose Meter Change from the drop-down menu.
The Meter Change dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-8. It has the
following four parameters to adjust:
• Snap to Bar: Select this check box to have any meter events align to
the first beat in the nearest bar. (See the section on setting up tempo
and meter events in Book III, Chapter 3.)
• Location: The number you enter in this field determines the begin-
ning of the meter (time signature) event. For songs with only one
time signature, you enter 1/1/000.
• Meter: Use these fields to type in the meter that you want to use.
• Click: From this menu, choose the note value for the clicks that are
played in each measure. Choosing a quarter note means you’ll hear
four clicks in a 4/4 measure.
Configuring your device
Of course, to play a click track in Pro Tools, you need a device to create the
sound (details, details). This can be an external MIDI sound module (such as
a drum machine or keyboard) or the DigiRack Click plug-in.
Follow these steps to configure the click-track device:
1. Choose Setup➪Click from the main menu or double-click the Click or
the Countoff button in the Transport window.
The Click/Countoff Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-8:

2. Use the Output drop-down menu to choose the device to play your
click.
If you’re using an external device, choose the port and MIDI channel that
your device is connected to. If you’re using the Click plug-in, choose None.
3. Choose when you want the click to be played by selecting from the
options at the top of the window.
You can select During Play and Record, Only During Record, or Only
During Countoff.
4. Enter the MIDI note, velocity, and duration for the accented and unac-
cented notes of the click in the appropriate fields.
5. Select whether you want a countoff as well as the number of bars 
you want.
Selecting Only During Record means that there’s no countoff when you
play back the track. If you select one of the other options and decide
that you still don’t want any countoff, type 0 bars in the Bars field.
The next order of business is to enable your click track, which you can do in
one of two ways:
✦Choose Setup➪Click from the main menu.
✦Click the Click button in the MIDI section of the Transport window.
When Click is engaged, this button is blue.
You can engage the countoff by clicking the Countoff button in the MIDI
section of the Transport window. This button displays the number of
bars that the countoff is set for. This button is blue when it’s engaged.
Figure 1-9:
Configure
your click

device.

Getting Ready to Record
452
If you want to use the Click plug-in — rather than an external device — to
play the click, do the following:
If you haven’t completed Steps 1–5 in the preceding list and you want to use
the internal click track plug-in, you can simply choose Track➪Create Click
Track. Then you’re all set to go.
1. Create a new instrument track by choosing Track➪New from the main
menu or pressing Shift+Ô+N (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+N (PC).
2. Use the Output selector to set the output of the track to the main outputs
(the outputs you use for your monitors, which are usually 1 and 2).
3. Make sure that the Inserts option is chosen under the Mix Window
Shows menu. (Choose View➪Mix Window to check.)
4. Choose Click from the Inserts drop-down menu (click and hold over
the arrow, and then choose Plug-In➪Instrument➪Click) for the track
you just created, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Your chosen click plays according to your choice in the Click/Countoff
Options dialog box.
I usually use a drum machine or other decent drum sound from an external
device to create my click track. The Click plug-in, as handy as it is, doesn’t
have the most pleasing sound.

R
ecording MIDI in Pro Tools is much like recording audio. The advan-
tage with MIDI is that you record only the performance data and not
the sound itself. This allows you flexibility when choosing the sound that
you ultimately want for your song.
In this chapter, you discover how to record MIDI in Pro Tools. You walk
through enabling your tracks and recording your MIDI data. You also get a
chance to overdub by using punch and loop recording.
Instrument tracks can be used the same way as MIDI tracks by recording
MIDI information and passing it along to an instrument (in this case, by
inserting an instrument into the track), which plays the notes and creates
the sound.
Recording MIDI Performances
If you already read through Book III, Chapter 4, you pretty much know the
basics about recording MIDI performances because the process is very simi-
lar to recording audio tracks. The only significant difference is that you can
set your system to wait until it receives MIDI data before starting to record.
(This keeps you from having to click the Record button in the Transport
window.) The following sections detail how to record single or multiple MIDI
and instrument tracks.
Enabling recording for MIDI and instrument tracks
You can record-enable your MIDI and instrument tracks the same way you
enable recording for audio tracks. Let me count the ways:
✦To record-enable a single track: Click the Record Enable button, which
you can find in either the track’s channel strip (in the Mix window) or

Recording MIDI Performances
454
the track menu (in the Edit window). The Record Enable button blinks
red to let you know it’s engaged.
✦To record-enable all tracks: Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (PC) the
Record Enable button on any track.
✦To record-enable selected tracks: Shift-click to select the tracks you
want in the playlist and then Shift+Option-click (Mac) or Shift+Alt-click
(PC) the Record Enable button of one of the selected tracks.
Setting the Wait for Note option
One of the nice things about recording MIDI in Pro Tools is that you can set
your session to start recording only after it starts receiving MIDI data. This
feature — Wait for Note — allows you to make sure that your first note is
timed exactly where Record Start Time is set.
To enable the Wait for Note feature, do the following:
1. Set your Transport window to display MIDI controls by choosing
View➪Transport➪MIDI Controls from the main menu.
The Transport window expands to include MIDI controls.
2. Click the Wait for Note button to highlight it, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Recording MIDI tracks in Pro Tools requires that you get a few tasks out of
the way first. Namely, choose the Record mode, create a track, set levels,
enable recording, and turn on a click track (if you’re using one). Those steps
are all covered in detail in Book III, Chapter 3; when you’ve got ’em done,
you’re ready to record some MIDI.
The next sections give you a basic overview of what you can do at that
point: Record a single track or multiple tracks, undo or cancel takes, record
additional takes and audition takes, use playlists to organize the whole mess,
or choose some takes to listen to.

Monitoring MIDI inputs
Even after you get your MIDI devices all hooked up and record-enabled, you
still won’t hear what you’re playing unless you make some connection to 
the analog outputs of your MIDI device and route them to an audio track in
Pro Tools.
To monitor your MIDI device through Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Connect the analog output of your MIDI device to one of the analog
inputs in your Digidesign hardware.
2. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Tracks dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus of the dialog box to enter the number of
tracks you want (1), the type (Audio), and whether you want your
track in mono or stereo. Click Create.
4. Using the new track’s Input selector, select the analog input that your
device is connected to in your Digidesign interface.
5. Using the new track’s Output selector, select the main outputs for your
session.
6. Record-enable this track by clicking the Record Enable button in
either the track’s channel strip (Mix window) or the track menu (Edit
window).
You should hear the sound coming from your MIDI device while you play
your MIDI performance.
Hearing instrument tracks
Instrument tracks, because they are a hybrid of MIDI and Auxiliary Input
tracks, are easier to set up to hear what you’re playing: All you need to do 
is set an output in the audio out section of the track. You do this the follow-
ing way:
1. Choose View➪Edit Window➪I/O from the main menu to open the I/O
section of the Edit window.
The I/O section shows the inputs and outputs for each track.
2. Within the I/O section of your track in the Edit window, click and hold
the Output selector until the Output drop-down menu appears.
3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Output menu until it rests on the output listing you want.

Playing Back Your Tracks
456
4. Release the mouse button to select your choice from the Output drop-
down menu.
This menu closes, and the output you selected appears in the Output
selector.
Recording MIDI and instrument tracks
After you record-enable your MIDI and instrument track(s) (see the “Enabling
recording for MIDI and instrument tracks” section, earlier in this chapter), you
can begin recording. Follow these steps to record one or more MIDI tracks:
1. Click the Record Enable button located in either the track channel
strip (Mix window) or track menu (Edit window) to record-enable the
track(s).
2. Using the channel strips located in the Mix window, set the level of
the instruments in your session using the fader for each audio track
associated with your MIDI devices.
This is so you hear your music the way you want.
3. Enable the click track and the pre-roll, if you’re using them.
4. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport section of the
Transport window.
Doing so ensures that you start recording at the beginning of the session.
5. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
This step gets you ready to record; it doesn’t start the actual recording
process.
6. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport window.
Pro Tools starts recording.
7. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button in the Transport sec-
tion of the Transport window or press the spacebar on your keyboard.
The finished take appears in the MIDI Regions list as a new region.
Playing Back Your Tracks
After you record a track, you’ll most likely want to listen to it to make sure
that it sounds how you want. Pro Tools offers you many ways to play back a
track. In the following sections, I guide you through a few of the many
options for playing back audio regions.

Book V
Chapter 2
Recording MIDI
Playing Back Your Tracks
457
Playing recorded tracks
After you record a track and click the Stop button, you can immediately hear
the track by toggling off the Record Enable button on your MIDI tracks —
click it to make the red light disappear — and then clicking the Play button.
Leave the audio tracks associated with the MIDI devices in record-enable
mode so that you hear the playback of the MIDI device from the recorded
MIDI data instead of the recorded audio that was recorded to that track
when you recorded your performance. You can adjust the volume by moving
the fader up and down in the channel strip for the audio track associated
with your MIDI device.
Setting scrolling options
Pro Tools lets you decide how you want the Edit window to scroll when a
session is playing or recording. Just choose Options➪Scrolling from the
main menu to see the choices displayed in Figure 2-2. The following list gives
you the scoop on each option:
✦No Scrolling: With you choose this, the Edit window remains where it while
as the session plays. You can still move through the session by manually
sliding the scroll bar at the bottom of the window while the session plays.
✦After Playback: Choosing this takes you to where the cursor is located
after the session is stopped.
✦Page: Page scrolling during playback keeps the cursor visible at all times
while the session plays. The cursor moves from left to right, and the Edit
window follows gamely along (just like Little Bo Peep’s sheep).
This is the option I generally choose because I can easily keep track of
where I am in the session at all times.

Changing sounds
One of the great features of recording MIDI data is that you can change the
sound that the recorded performance plays. This lets you decide what
sound you use in your song after you played the part.
MIDI tracks
You can change the playback sound of a recorded MIDI track one of two ways:
✦Change the MIDI device or channel. Click the Output selector for the
MIDI track and scroll to a different MIDI channel or MIDI device.
✦Change the MIDI patch. Open the Patch drop-down menu located in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 2-3. After
the Patch dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-4, choose a patch from
the list and then click Done to close the window.
Instrument tracks
Because instrument tracks are a hybrid between a MIDI track and an Auxiliary
input track, you make changes to the sound your track plays differently.
Here’s how to change the sound from an instrument track:

1. Double-click the plug-in in the Insert section of either the Edit or Mix
window.
This opens a window for the software instrument.
2. Make any adjustments you want to the software instrument until you
like the sound.
3. Close the software instrument’s window.
To change the software instrument connected to your instrument track, do
the following:
1. Click and hold the Insert selector for the inserted software instrument
and drag to another instrument (assuming you have one to choose from).
2. Release the mouse button.
The window for your new software instrument opens.
3. Choose the settings you want for your new instrument.
4. Close the window.
Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
If you have a take (a recorded performance) that you don’t particularly like,
you can get rid of it several different ways. You can cancel the take while
you’re recording, you can undo the take after you record, or you can clear
the audio region from the Audio Regions list. All these options are detailed in
the following sections.
Canceling your performance
Canceling a performance is handy when you’re in the middle of recording, and
you know that you’re not going to keep the take. To cancel a performance,
simply press Ô+. (period; Mac) or Ctrl+. (period; PC). This stops the session
and clears the audio region created for this take with two keystrokes.
Undoing your take
If you already stopped recording and you know you don’t want to keep your
latest try, you can undo the take by choosing Edit➪Undo MIDI Recording
from the main menu (as shown in Figure 2-5), or by pressing Ô+Z (Mac) or
Ctrl+Z (PC).
If you punch in more than once before you stopped the recording, only the
last punch is undone. The rest of the punches remain. (Read more about this
in the upcoming section, “Punching in and out.”)

Overdubbing MIDI Performances
460
When you use Loop record mode, all the takes from the loop sequence are
undone.
Clearing the file from the Regions list
After hearing a few of your takes, maybe you want to get rid of one or more
of them. Just clear the offending takes from the Regions list. Here’s how to
get that done:
1. Highlight the region you want to get rid of in the Regions list by 
clicking it.
The Regions list is located in the lower-right corner of the Edit window. 
If this section of the Edit window isn’t visible, click the double arrow at
the bottom-right corner of the Edit window to expand it.
2. Click and hold the Regions list title at the top of the list to access the
Regions drop-down menu and then choose Clear Selected (as shown
in Figure 2-6), or press Shift+Ô+B (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+B (PC).
To select more than one region to clear, hold the Shift key while you
click each region.
Overdubbing MIDI Performances
After you have some MIDI performances recorded, you can add to or change
them easily. The time-honored name for this kind of recording is overdubbing,

but MIDI takes it to a whole new level. In Pro Tools, you can overdub MIDI in
several ways: You can punch in or out, loop, and either merge (that is, add)
new data or replace existing performance information. The following sec-
tions get you up to speed on these procedures.
Using MIDI Merge/Replace
When you overdub to a MIDI track, Pro Tools offers you the option to either
replace existing material or add new data to it. Which option you use
depends on the position of the MIDI Merge button located in the Transport
window (as shown in Figure 2-7):
✦When the button is engaged (MIDI Merge mode): New material is
merged with any existing MIDI data on the record-enabled track(s).
✦When the button is disengaged (MIDI Replace mode): New MIDI data
replaces any existing information on record-enabled track(s).
To engage MIDI Merge, do the following:
1. Open the MIDI controls section of the Transport window by choosing
View➪Transport➪MIDI Controls from the main menu.
The Transport window expands to include the MIDI controls section.
2. Click the MIDI Merge button.
The button becomes highlighted.

Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and want to record over only part of it,
you can set points at which to start and stop recording within the session:
that is, punching in and out. Punching in or out of a track involves first set-
ting a start and an end point. This can be done several ways; the next sec-
tions give you the details.
Using the Start/End fields in the Transport section 
of the Transport window
This method is pretty straightforward. To set your start and end points via
the Transport section, do the following:
1. Choose View➪Transport➪Expanded from the main menu to get a
nice, big view of the window.
2. Click in the Start field in the Transport section of the Transport
window, type in the beginning of the punch section you want, and
then press Return/Enter.
This field displays in the same format as the main counter. In the case of
Figure 2-8, the format is Bars and Beats.
3. Click in the End field, type in the end of the range, and then press
Return/Enter.
This field is displayed as well in the format selected for the main counter
(like in Figure 2-8).
Selecting a section of a track’s playlist
For those of you out there who are especially handy with a mouse, this
method may have some appeal:
1. Make sure that the Link Edit and Timeline Selection option is chosen
under the Options menu.
Figure 2-8:

2. Using the Selector tool, click and drag a recorded range in your track,
as shown in Figure 2-9.
The section becomes highlighted, and the session start and end points
are set to match the beginning and ending of this selection.
Dragging the start and end point markers along the ruler bar
The start and end point markers are displayed along the Timeline in the Edit
window as up and down arrows — down for punch in and up for punch out.
The arrows are blue when no tracks are record-enabled and red when one or
more tracks are record-enabled. Setting start and end points in the Timeline
consists of these steps:
1. Make sure that the Link Edit and Timeline Selections is chosen under
the Options menu.
2. Select the Grid edit mode (click on the Grid mode selector in the
upper left of the Edit window) if you want the markers to snap to the
grid. Otherwise, use any other Edit mode.
3. Click and drag the Start and End Point arrows to where you want
them, as shown in Figure 2-10.

Performing the punch
After you designate the start and end points of your punch-in-and-out range,
you can record to that section by doing the following:
1. Set and enable a pre-roll.
Doing so enables you to hear the previously recorded track before 
the punch-in happens. Here’s the quick drill. (See Book III, Chapter 4 
for details.)
a. Click the Pre-Roll field in the expanded version of the Transport
window and type in a pre-roll time. (Choose View➪Transport➪
Expanded if you need to expand the window.)
b. Click the Pre-Roll button in the expanded version of the Transport
window to enable the pre-roll function.
2. Set and enable a post-roll.
Doing so lets you hear how your punch fits in with your previously
recorded track. Here’s the quick drill. (See Book III, Chapter 4 for
details.)
a. Click the Post-Roll field in the expanded version of the Transport
window and type in a pre-roll time. (Choose View➪Transport➪
Expanded if you need to expand the window.)
b. Click the Post-Roll button in the expanded version of the Transport
window to enable the post-roll function.
3. Choose the nondestructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Options menu.
4. Choose either MIDI Merge or MIDI Replace mode.
See the “Using MIDI Merge/Replace” section, earlier in the chapter, for
more on MIDI Merge/Replace.
5. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip 
(Mix window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.
6. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
The Record button flashes red.
7. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport
window when you’re ready to record.
The session starts at the pre-roll time, the Record button flashes red,
and you hear the previously recorded track until the pre-roll is over. The

Book V

monitoring then switches to the Input source and the Record button
stops flashing (but remains red). After you hit the end of the record
range, the session stops playing, or (if you enabled a post-roll) the
recording stops. If the recording stops to accommodate a post-roll, the
Record button starts flashing again. The monitoring then switches back
to the recorded region until the end of the post-roll period. When the
post-roll is done, the session stops playing.
Punching MIDI on the fly
With MIDI, you can punch in and out of a track while the session plays. This
is punching on the fly and is especially effective if you have an interface with
a footswitch input (such as the 003 or 003 Rack) and a footswitch connected
to the footswitch input on your interface.
Here’s how to punch on the fly:
1. Choose the nondestructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Options menu.
2. Select either MIDI Merge or MIDI Replace mode.
See the “Using MIDI Merge/Replace” section, earlier in the chapter, for
more on MIDI Merge/Replace.
3. Disable the Wait for Note and Countoff options in the Transport
window.
4. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip (Mix
window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.
5. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
The session plays.
6. When you reach the point where you want to start recording in the
session, click the Record button or press the footswitch.
The punch begins.
7. Play what you want.
8. When you reach the point that you want to stop recording, click the
Record button or press the footswitch again.
Recording stops, but the session continues playing — and, with any
luck, seamlessly.

Loop recording
Use loop recording to choose a section of the song to repeatedly record over.
This makes it easy to try a bunch of takes without having to manually start
and stop every time you go through the section. Loop recording can be done
a bunch of ways. I described two of ’em in the Audio Recording chapters
(Book III, Chapters 3 and 4), but I prefer using MIDI Merge mode to loop-
record MIDI. (Makes sense, doesn’t it?)
To loop-record using MIDI Merge mode, do the following:
1. Choose the nondestructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Options menu.
2. Enable MIDI Merge mode.
The button becomes highlighted.
3. Disable the Wait for Note and Countoff options in the Transport sec-
tion of the Transport window.
4. Enable the Link Edit and Timeline Selection option in the Options
menu.
5. Choose the Selector tool in the Edit window.
6. Click and drag across the section of the track that you want to record
over.
7. (Optional) Click in the Pre-Roll field in the expanded Transport
window and type in a pre-roll time. Click the Pre-Roll button in the
Transport window to enable the pre-roll function.
Choose View➪Transport➪Expanded if you need to expand the window.
If you don’t want to hear a section of the session before the loop begins,
skip this step.
8. Click the Record Enable button located in either the track channel
strip (Mix window) or track menu (Edit window) to record enable 
the track.
9. Select Loop Record mode.
You have three ways to make this selection:
• Check the Loop Record option under the Options menu.
• Press Option+L (Mac) or Alt+L (PC).
• Control-click (Mac) or right-click (PC) the Record button in the
Transport window until the Loop Record icon shows up.

Book V

Recording System-Exclusive Data
467
10. Click Play in the Transport section of the Transport window to start
recording.
While the recording is under way, the new MIDI data appears in the track
as a new region (and in the MIDI Regions list) but doesn’t replace the
previously recorded material.
11. Click Stop when you finish recording.
If you designated a pre-roll, it only happens before the first time through the
loop. After that, the loop goes from start point to end point, back to the start
point, and so on, as many times as needed.
If you loop-record using the Loop Record mode without engaging MIDI Merge,
you create a new region in the MIDI Regions list each time you go through
the loop. This is in contrast to loop-recording audio tracks, in which all the
takes are stored in one audio file.
Recording System-Exclusive Data
In Pro Tools, you can record system-exclusive data — data that is unique 
to your MIDI device — to a MIDI track. That means that you can record
changes made to your patches (prepared sounds selected from a sound
bank) to your configuration as well as any real-time changes in the system.
For example, you can record patch changes so that your MIDI device changes
its sound while the session plays (from, say, a Chainsaw patch to a Bagpipe
patch). You can also store the parameter settings for a device and have Pro
Tools automatically restore those settings to your device before your ses-
sion plays.
To record system-exclusive data to a MIDI track in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Connect the MIDI Out of your device to one of the MIDI In ports con-
figured in Pro Tools.
2. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus of the dialog box to enter the number of
tracks you want (1), the type (MIDI), and whether you want your track
in samples or ticks. Click Create.
4. Using the new track’s Input selector, set the input of the track to the
MIDI In port that’s connected to your device.

5. Choose the non-destructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Options menu.
6. Choose Setup➪MIDI➪Input Filter from the main menu.
The MIDI Input Filter dialog box appears.
7. Enable system-exclusive recording by selecting the System Exclusive
check box in the MIDI Input Filter dialog box.
8. Enable the Wait for Note function in the Transport window.
9. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport window to return to
the beginning of the session.
10. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip (Mix
window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.
11. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
The Record, Play, and Wait for Note buttons flash.
12. Initiate the MIDI dump on your MIDI Device.
Check your MIDI device’s manual to figure how this is done; it’s different
for every device.
The transfer begins.
13. Click Stop when the transfer is finished.
To send system-exclusive data back to your device, do the following:
1. Make sure that the MIDI Out port of your MIDI interface is connected
to the MIDI In port of your device.
2. Using the Output selector of the MIDI track that has the system-
exclusive data, set the output to the MIDI port that’s connected to 
your device.
3. Set your device to receive system-exclusive data.
You might need to check your owner’s manual for details on how to 
do this.
4. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport section of the
Transport window to return the session to the beginning.
5. Click Play in the Transport window.
The session plays, and the system-exclusive data is received.
6. Click Stop when the transfer is complete.

lthough MIDI editing in Pro Tools isn’t as elaborate as what you find in
some programs (such as Logic or Sonar), it’s plenty powerful enough
to tweak your MIDI data quite a bit. If your overall MIDI needs are moderate,
the relatively simple Pro Tools MIDI features can do what you need with
minimum fuss.
In this chapter, you explore the MIDI-editing functions available to you in
Pro Tools. You examine the many uses of the Pencil tool, discovering ways
to edit MIDI notes, controller data, and system-exclusive messages.
Working with MIDI and Instrument Tracks
Working with MIDI and instrument tracks is almost the same as working
with audio tracks. (The latter are covered in great detail in Book IV,
Chapters 1 and 2.) The following sections explain track views, selecting MIDI
data, understanding regions, and setting default program changes.
Taking a look at track views
You can adjust the track view for MIDI and Instrument tracks by clicking the
Track View selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window, as
shown in Figure 3-1. The track views for MIDI and Instrument tracks include
the following options:
✦Blocks: In Blocks view, regions are displayed as blocks, each showing
only the region name. This view takes up the least amount of processing
power to show and redraw, which makes this the best option after all
your editing is done and you’re ready to start mixing.

Working with MIDI and Instrument Tracks
470
✦Regions: Regions view shows the regions in the track, also displaying
notes in the track in the piano-roll fashion that you can see in Figure 3-2.
The notes can’t be edited, but the regions can be. This view is useful
when you want to move or edit the regions in your track.
When you edit in Regions view on a MIDI or Instrument track, you edit
continuous controller events (volume, pitch bend, after-touch — see
Book V, Chapter 2) along with the region because such events are con-
nected to the region and not to the track’s playlist.
✦Notes: Using Notes view displays the location, pitch, and duration of the
notes in the track in piano-roll format (as shown in Figure 3-3). You can
edit or insert MIDI notes in this view.
MIDI notes are shown as small rectangles. The horizontal range repre-
sents the location and duration of the note; the vertical placement
shows the note’s pitch.
Along the left side of the track’s playlist is a representation of a key-
board with up and down arrows, which allow you to scroll through the
octaves of the notes. This is necessary because not all the possible MIDI
notes can be displayed in the track’s playlist at one time. A single line at
the top or bottom of the track display designates any notes that can’t be
displayed (because they’re above or below the octave being displayed).
You can also scroll through the octaves in the playlist by using the
Grabber tool and dragging the piano-roll display up and down.

✦Velocity: This view displays — and allows you to edit — velocity (note
volume) settings for each note in the track. (You can still see the piano-
roll data in the background.)
✦Volume: Volume view shows automation volume curves with breakpoints —
markers that show shifts in the automation level — displayed as dots
along the line. Note data, in piano-roll format, is shown in the background.
In this view, you can edit the volume data but not the underlying notes.
✦Pan: This view displays and allows you to adjust panning automation
data (far left at the top and far right at the bottom) with the piano-roll
display in the background.
✦Mute: This view shows mute automation settings for the track and
allows you to mute or unmute the track. Note data, in piano-roll format,
is shown in the background.
✦Pitch Bend: Pitch Bend view shows any pitch bend data in the track as a
line graph with editable breakpoints. The piano-roll data is shown in the
background but can’t be edited.
✦Mono After Touch: This view shows after-touch data — the velocity of
the note after the initial touch of the keyboard — as a line graph with
editable breakpoints. The piano-roll data is shown in the background to
help you know where you are in the session.
✦Program Change: This view displays program-change information for
the track with the piano-roll data in the background (uneditable, of
course). Use this view to add or edit program-change events.
✦Sysex: This view shows system-exclusive data — messages exclusive to
the MIDI device — for the track.
✦Controller: This view shows continuous controller data, such as modu-
lation wheel, breath controller, foot control, and sustain with the piano-
roll data in the background. Use this view to add or edit continuous
controller data for your track.

You can toggle between the two most-used MIDI track views: Regions and
Notes. Do this by pressing Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) while you press
the minus key on the main section of the keyboard. Or, simply press the
minus key (from the main keyboard, not the number pad) after engaging the
Command Keyboard Focus button. (See Book II, Chapter 4, for more on the
Command Keyboard Focus feature.)
Selecting track material
You can select track material the same way you select material from audio
tracks — well, okay, with a few variations. The following sections tell you
about those variations; Book IV, Chapter 2 covers the selection stuff about
audio tracks that’s perfectly applicable to MIDI and Instrument tracks. (You
may want to skim through Book IV, Chapter 2 to refresh your memory about
selection basics.)
MIDI notes are selected from Notes view; regions are selected from Regions
view.
Selecting notes with the Pencil tool
You select notes with the Pencil tool by clicking the notes. (No big deal,
right?) To select more than one note, press the Shift key while you click each
note. Selected notes become highlighted.
Using the Selector tool
When you use the Selector tool to select notes, certain conditions apply.
They’re pretty straightforward:
✦Before a note can be included in a selection, its start point must be in
the selection range.
In Figure 3-4, for example, the note whose start point begins before the
selection range is not selected. (You can tell it’s not selected because it’s
not highlighted.)
✦Notes with end points outside the selection range are still selected.
✦When you select notes with the Selector tool, you also select (automat-
ically) all the underlying automation and controller data pertaining to
the notes.
Grabbing with the Grabber tool
When you select a series of notes with the Grabber tool, all notes partially 
or fully contained in the Grabber selection are selected, as shown in Figure
3-5. Notes selected with the Grabber tool don’t include automation or con-
troller data.

Selecting notes from the mini keyboard
You can select all the notes in a track that have the same pitch by clicking
the represented MIDI note in the mini keyboard, which is located along the
left side of the track’s playlist display, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Recognizing regions
The procedures for working with MIDI regions are the same as those for audio
regions. Book IV, Chapter 1 describes how to select and view regions in a
track’s playlist, as well as how to work with regions in the Regions list. The pro-
cedures for working with the MIDI Regions list are the same as those for work-
ing with the Regions list, so if you check out Book IV, Chapter 1, you’re all set.

Dealing with Note Chasing
474
Setting MIDI patches on tracks
You can change the default program (sound patch) in use with your MIDI
tracks so your MIDI device automatically resets to the program you want for
your track. Here’s how to make it happen:
1. Click the Program button in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window, as shown in Figure 3-7.
The Patch Select dialog box opens.
2. Click the patch number or name that you want from the list in the
main section of the dialog box.
It becomes highlighted.
Depending on your MIDI device, you might need to specify a bank 
along with the patch number. The bank number is entered in one of the
Controller fields at the top of the dialog box. Check the specification 
for your device to see what to enter in this field.
3. Click Done.
The Patch Select dialog box closes, and the patch number/name is dis-
played on the Program button of the Track Controls section.
You can have Pro Tools automatically scroll through the patches in your
MIDI sound module by selecting the Incremental Patch option in the Patch
Select dialog box and entering a value for the number of seconds that each
patch sounds as your session plays.
Dealing with Note Chasing
Note chasing makes sure that when you start your session in the middle of a
long MIDI note, the note is played. This is useful when you want to start and
Figure 3-7:
The Program
button is
located in
the Track
Controls.

Book V
Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
475
stop the session from anywhere and still be able to hear the notes that are
recorded.
The Note Chasing feature is turned on by default, but you might want to turn
it off on any tracks that play loops to ensure that the loop doesn’t get out of
sync when you start and stop the session in the middle of its sequence.
To turn on and off Note Chasing, do the following:
1. Click the track’s Playlist selector, located in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window.
The selector is the arrow to the right of the name of the track.
The Track Playlist drop-down menu opens with an option for engaging
note chasing in the track.
2. Choose Note Chasing from the Track Playlist menu.
You deselect (uncheck) to turn the Note Chasing feature off and select
(check) to turn it on.
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
Like with audio, you do most of your MIDI editing from the Edit window. The
process, again, is very similar to editing audio (described in Book IV,
Chapters 1–3). The following sections offer some tips and tricks tailored to
inserting, deleting, and editing MIDI data. For the most part, though, I dis-
cuss the amazing Pencil tool, the Smart tool, and the Grabber tool.
If your MIDI region exists in only one location (that is, it’s not shared with other
tracks or sessions), any changes you make to the data in that region change it
permanently. To ensure that you don’t lose important data while editing (or if
you want to be able to return to the original), make a copy of the playlist and
work from there. (I explain playlists in detail in Book IV, Chapter 1.)
Perusing the Pencil tools
Pro Tools offers seven Pencil tools — Free Hand, Line, Triangle, Square,
Random, Parabolic, and S-Curve — that you can use to create and edit MIDI
data easily with your mouse. You select these tools by clicking and holding
the Pencil Tool icon and then choosing from the drop-down menu that
appears, as shown in Figure 3-8. Each tool can be used to add notes and
draw velocity and controller data, but each one works a little differently, as
the following sections make clear.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
476
Free Hand
When you insert notes, here’s what happens:
✦You can place them anywhere you want and drag your mouse to spec-
ify the duration you want the note to be.
✦If you simply click with the Free Hand Pencil tool to insert a note, the
note duration is equal to the grid value for your session. (Grid values
are boundaries you can set for your session and are set in the Grid Value
drop-down menu, located just below the Pencil Tool button in the Edit
window.)
✦Note velocity is determined by the setting you have in the MIDI tab of
the Preferences dialog box. Choose Setup➪Preferences to access the
Preferences dialog box.
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, here’s what happens:
✦You can draw any shape you want with your mouse.
✦The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you’ve
chosen for controller data in the MIDI tab of the Preferences 
dialog box. Choose Setup➪Preferences to access the Preferences 
dialog box.
Line
When you insert notes, here’s what you get:
✦You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
✦The note velocity is determined by the setting you have on the MIDI
tab of the Preferences dialog box.

Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data

477
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, these conditions
apply:
✦The line is straight from the initial mouse click through the drag and
release.
✦The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you choose
for controller data on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
Triangle
When you insert notes, three conditions apply:
✦You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
✦The note velocity oscillates between the setting you have for Note 
on Velocity on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box and 127
(maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, here’s what you see:
✦The line is a triangular pattern, which changes direction according to
the current grid value in your session.
✦The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings for controller
data you chose on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
Square
When you insert notes, here’s the skinny:
✦You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
✦The note velocity alternates between the setting you have for Note on
Velocity on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box and 127 (the
maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, it works this way:
✦The line is a square pattern, which repeats according to the current
grid value in your session.
✦The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you chose for
controller data on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
478
Random
When you insert notes, here’s what you get:
✦You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
✦The note velocity changes randomly between the setting you have for
Note on Velocity on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box and
127 (maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, the line is a random
pattern, which changes value according to the current grid value in your 
session.
Custom note duration
When you insert a note by using one of Pencil tools and you want a different
value than the grid setting in your session, you can choose the Custom Note
Duration option, which is located at the bottom of the Pencil tool drop-down
menu. Enabling this option adds the Notes button shown here in the margin
beneath the Pencil Tool icon on the Edit Window toolbar.
The Custom Note Duration option lets you specify a note duration other
than your current grid setting.
To choose a custom note duration when you’re inserting a MIDI note, do the
following:
1. Click and hold the Pencil icon in the Edit window toolbar.
The Pencil tool drop-down menu appears.
2. Choose Custom Note Duration from the Pencil tool drop-down menu.
The Notes button appears beneath the Pencil icon on the Edit Window
toolbar.
3. Choose which Pencil tool you want to use from the drop-down menu.
4. Using the Notes button beneath the Pencil Tool button, choose a note
duration.
5. Using the Pencil tool you select in Step 3, insert the note in your track.
Adding MIDI events
You can add MIDI notes or controller data (collectively called MIDI events) to
a MIDI or Instrument track by using the Pencil tool. (See the preceding sec-
tion for more about the Pencil tools.)

Inserting notes
To use the Pencil tool to insert a note, do the following:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu in the Track Controls section
of the Edit Window, set the track view to Notes.
2. Click and hold the Pencil icon and then choose the Pencil tool you
want to use from the Pencil Tool drop-down menu that appears.
3. Locate the place you want to add your MIDI note in the track’s playlist
area.
4. With the Pencil tool you select in Step 2, click in the playlist to insert
a note with a duration equal to the grid value.
When you use the Free Hand tool, you can set the note to whatever duration
you want. Do so by clicking the start point of the note in the track’s playlist,
dragging to the end point you want, and then releasing the mouse button.
If you want to hear the MIDI note while you insert it, first make sure that you
have the Play MIDI Notes When Editing preference chosen on the MIDI tab

because the event is automatically deleted.
3. Press Delete/Backspace on your keyboard or choose Edit➪Clear from
the main menu.
The event is deleted.
Changing MIDI events
In the Edit window, you can edit MIDI notes in a variety of ways including
changing pitch, duration, velocity, and time location.
When you edit or move notes, you can make a copy of the note to move by
pressing Option (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) while you drag the note.
Changing a note’s pitch
To change a note’s pitch, do the following:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Select the Pencil or the Grabber tool.
3. Press Shift to keep the note’s start point from changing while you
move it.
4. Click the note and drag it up (higher pitch) or down (lower pitch) in
the playlist.

you can type in a location for the note and then click Done.
5. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Changing a note’s velocity
In the MIDI world, velocity means volume. To change a note’s velocity, do the
following:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, set your track to Velocity view.
2. Select the Grabber tool.
3. Click the diamond-shaped icon at the top of the velocity stalk — the
vertical line with a diamond at the top representing the velocity 
level — in the track’s playlist and then drag it up or down.
4. Release the mouse button when the velocity is where you want it.
You can also use one of the Pencil tools to draw various velocity shapes.
Select the desired Pencil tool and then draw a line in the track’s playlist
where you want the velocities to be. (See “Perusing the Pencil tools” section,
earlier in this chapter, for more on drawing velocity settings.)
You can scale the velocities of several notes by using the Selector to select
the notes and then the Trimmer to drag them up or down as a unit. This lets
you keep the relationship between the velocities the same as you change the
overall levels.

List, do the following:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Click the note by using the Pencil or the Grabber tool.
The note’s attributes show up in the MIDI Event List window with a blue
highlight (as shown in Figure 3-10).
3. Click in the Attribute field(s) you want to change:
• Start: This field indicates the start point of the selected note. This is
displayed in the main time scale setting for the session.
• End: This field controls the end point of the note, which is displayed
in the main time scale format. If this field isn’t visible, click the
Options button at the top of the MIDI Event List dialog box and
choose Show Note End Time from the menu that appears.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
484
• Length/Info: This field displays the duration of the note (shown in 
the session’s main time scale). Changing the start or end times also
changes this value. Changing this field alters the end point but leaves
the start point untouched. MIDI events without length data (such as
program changes or controller events) show data associated with
that data, such as the program number or controller event type. If
this field isn’t visible, click the Options button at the top of the MIDI
Event List dialog box and choose Show Note Length from the menu
that appears.
• Pitch: This field displays the pitch of the note.
• Attack Velocity: This field shows the velocity of the start of the note
as a MIDI value between 0 and 127.
• Release Velocity: This field displays the release velocity of the note as
a MIDI value between 0 and 127.
4. Enter in the new value in the field corresponding to the attribute you
want to change.
5. Press Return/Enter.
The note changes to match the new attributes.
If you want to change more than one field, press / (the front-slash key) to
move between fields.
Editing program data
Because MIDI contains no sound in itself, you can create program change
events to change the sound patches of your MIDI sound modules throughout
the session. This can keep your computer processing resources optimized
as well as keep you from using more tracks than absolutely necessary for

your session, which is a good thing because Pro Tools allows you to have no
more than 32 active tracks playing in a session.
Changing program patches
Program patches are the sounds available in your MIDI device. Here’s how to
change program patches:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, set the track to Program
Change view.
2. With the Grabber tool, double-click the program change event you
want to change.
The Patch Select dialog box appears.
3. In the Patch Select dialog box, select the new patch name/number. 
(If the patch resides on a different bank as the current patch, select
the new bank as well.)
4. Click Done.
The Patch Select dialog box closes, and the new program is sounded
when you play your session.
Moving program change markers
Program change markers are helpful little tools because they tell Pro Tools
when to change the sound of your MIDI device while your session plays. To
move a program change marker, follow these steps:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, set the track to Program
Change view.
2. Select the Grabber or the Pencil tool.
3. Click and drag the Program Change Marker left or right.
• If you have Grid mode enabled, the program change event moves to
the closest grid boundary.
• If you have Spot mode selected, the Spot dialog box opens; there, you
can enter a new location for the marker and then click Done.
Changing continuous controller data
When you deal with continuous controller data, you are dealing with Volume,
Pan, Pitch Bend, Mono Aftertouch, and MIDI controllers. All this data is rep-
resented as a line graph punctuated by a series of breakpoints. You have a
choice when you want to make changes: you can edit the line itself using the
Pencil tool; or you can edit the breakpoints by using the Grabber, the Pencil,
or the Smart tool.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
486
Editing lines with the Pencil tool
To edit the line graph with a Pencil tool, do the following:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, select the track view that cor-
responds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
Mono Aftertouch, MIDI Controller).
2. Click and hold the Pencil icon, and then select the Pencil tool you
want to use from the menu that appears.
3. Click in the playlist where you want to start drawing and then drag
your mouse to draw the new values.
The line is drawn, and breakpoints are inserted according to the resolu-
tion you set for the Pencil Tool Resolution When Drawing Controller
Data option on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose
Setup➪Preferences from the main menu to access the Preferences 
dialog box.)
4. Release the mouse button when you reach the end of your edit.
Editing breakpoints
If you’re not adept at drawing lines, you might want to work with break-
points instead. Here’s how:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, select the track view that cor-
responds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
Mono Aftertouch, MIDI Controller).
2. Select the Grabber tool.
3. Click and drag the breakpoint.
4. Release the mouse button.
Scaling breakpoints
When you scale breakpoints, you move a group of breakpoints while retain-
ing the relationship between them. You can use the Trimmer tool to scale
breakpoints, as in the following step list:
1. From the Track View drop-down menu, select the track view that cor-
responds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
Mono Aftertouch, MIDI Controller).
2. Select the Selector tool.
3. With your mouse, click and drag across the breakpoints you want 
to scale.
The selection becomes highlighted.

4. Select the Trimmer tool.
5. Click and drag the breakpoints up or down.
The breakpoints move as a unit, but they don’t all move the same
amount. Rather, they move differently to keep the relationship between
the breakpoints intact.
6. Release your mouse button.
There are other ways to edit continuous controller data in Pro Tools. Check
out Book VI, Chapter 6 to find out more.
Using the Smart tool
The Smart tool puts a new spin on three older tools: namely, the Trimmer,
Selector, and Grabber tools. Basically, the Smart tool changes how it works
depending on what you try to do with it. The following sections detail how
this tool behaves when you work with MIDI data.
To use the Smart tool, press the button located under the Selector tool in the
Edit window, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Check out Book IV, Chapter 4 for more details about the Smart tool.
Using the Smart tool in Notes view
When you use the Smart tool with your Track view set to Notes, the tool
behaves the following way:
✦Placing the cursor so that it doesn’t touch any notes or pressing Ô
(Mac) or Ctrl (PC) enables the Selector face of the Smart tool. You can
then click and drag to make a selection.
✦Positioning the cursor near the middle of a note enables the Grabber
face of the Smart tool.
Click here to enable the Smart tool.
Figure 3-11:

✦Placing the cursor over the start or end point of a note enables the
Trimmer face of the Smart tool.
✦To turn the Smart tool into an eraser, make sure the cursor isn’t touch-
ing any notes (the Selector appears) and then press Control+Option
(Mac) or Windows+Alt (PC).
Using the Smart tool in an Automation or in Controller views
When you use the Smart tool in an Automation view (Volume, Mute, or Pan)
or in Controller view, the tool acts the following ways: 
✦Trimmer: To enable the Trimmer tool, position your cursor in the top
quarter of the region. The Trimmer icon appears. You can move your
cursor up and down to change the value or to create breakpoints. If you
want finer control of the Trimmer tool while you work, press Ô (Mac) or
Ctrl (PC) after you begin trimming.
✦Selector: To enable the Selector tool, position your cursor in the lower
three-quarters of the region. You can then drag your selection.
✦Grabber: To enable the Grabber tool, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC). You
can do several things with the Grabber tool with a track set to an
automation view:
• Edit existing breakpoints: Position the cursor near one of these
points, and the Grabber appears. You can increase the resolution of
your movements to fine-control by pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC)
after you start moving the breakpoint.
• Constrain the Grabber vertically: To keep the Grabber from moving
right or left, press Shift — or, if you set the tool to fine control, press
Ô+Shift (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift (PC).
Exploring MIDI Events
The MIDI Event List consists of all the MIDI data in your track. This list dis-
plays the location, pitch, velocity, and duration of every note as well as all
other parameters for the track. The MIDI Event List window lets you edit all
your track’s MIDI data in one place, which makes it one extremely helpful
tool in the Pro Tools toolbox. The following sections explain the ways to best
use this window to edit your track.
Exploring the MIDI Event List window
The MIDI Event List window, as shown in Figure 3-12, displays MIDI data for a
selected track. You can open the window in several different ways:

Book V
Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data

✦Choose Event➪MIDI Event List from the main menu.
✦Press Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) while you double-click the MIDI
track name in the Edit or Mix window.
✦Press Option+= (equal sign; Mac) or Alt+= (equal sign; PC). Pressing
this combination again toggles you back to the Edit window.
If you have a selection made within a MIDI track and you open the MIDI
Event List window, the selected note or range of notes is highlighted.
The cursor location is marked with an arrow in the MIDI Event List.
Examining MIDI Event menus
The MIDI Event List contains three menus at the top of the window: Track
Selector, Options, and Insert. The following list gives you the details on the
various menu options:
✦Track Selector: This menu shows the track that’s listed in the window
and lets you choose a different track to display.
✦Options: This menu consists of the following options, as shown in 
Figure 3-13:
• Show Sub Counter: This option displays the event times in the sub-
counter value. (Book II, Chapter 4 has more on how to use counters.)
• Go To: Choosing this option opens a dialog box in which you enter
the location in the session you want to go to.

• Scroll to Edit Selection: This automatically moves the MIDI Event List
to the Edit Start or Insertion point for the session.
• Page Scroll During Playback: This option scrolls the MIDI Event List
while your session plays.
• Scroll During Edit Selection: This option automatically scrolls the MIDI
Event List while you move your edit point in the Edit window.
• Show Note Length: Selecting this option displays the length of the
MIDI notes in the MIDI Event List.
• Show Note End Time: This option lets you display the end time of the
MIDI notes in the Event List instead of the note length. (Sorry, but
you can’t have both.)
• Insert at Edit Location: This option lets you designate that any
inserted event is placed at the Edit Start or Insertion point.
• Insert at Playback Location: This option lets you insert notes on the
fly while the session plays back.
• Insert at Playback Location with Grid: This option snaps any inserted
notes placed on the fly (see the previous bullet) to the nearest grid
boundary.
• View Filter: This option opens the MIDI Event List View Filter dialog
box, as shown in Figure 3-14. You use this dialog box to specify which
fields appear in the MIDI Event List dialog box. This, in turn, effects
which events are edited by using Cut, Copy, and Paste. Any fields
that are not displayed in the MIDI Event List aren’t affected by Cut,
Copy, and Paste commands. (For more about this dialog box, see
Chapter 4 in this mini-book.)
✦Insert: The Insert menu consists of the types of events you can insert
into the track using the MIDI Event List. This menu is covered in greater
detail in the “Inserting MIDI events” section, later in this chapter.

Although it isn’t actually a menu option, the number of Events in your cur-
rent track is displayed to the right of the three menus listed in this section.
Eyeing the rest of the MIDI Event List
Below the MIDI Event menus (see the preceding section) lies the whole
range of possible MIDI events for the track. (Refer to Figure 3-12.) These
events are listed in order from the beginning of the session to the end and
are listed in three columns. (The “Inserting MIDI events” section, later in this
chapter, explores these columns further.)
✦Start: This column displays the location of the event’s Start point in
either the main or sub-counter time format, depending on whether you
have the Show Sub Counter option selected in the Options menu. (See
the “Examining MIDI Event menus” section, earlier in this chapter.)
If more than one event is located at the same place in the session (like
with chords, for example), the location for all but the first event is
dimmed. This makes it easier to see these multiple events.
To the left of the Start point is an arrow indicating the location of the
cursor in the session.
✦Event: This column shows the event type (indicated by the icon at the left
of the column) as well as its associated values. In the case of notes, you
see the note letter and octave as well as its attack and release velocities.
✦Length/Info: This column shows the length or end point of the MIDI
notes, depending on whether you have the Show Note Length or Show
Note End Time option selected under the Options menu. (See the pre-
ceding section.)

Getting around the MIDI Event List
Here are several ways to move quickly around the MIDI Event List:
✦Double-clicking the event in the list highlights your selection.
✦Pressing Tab or the down-arrow key (↓) moves you to the next event.
✦Pressing Option+Tab (Mac) or Ctrl+Tab (PC) or the up-arrow key (↑)
moves you to the previous event.
✦Using the left (←) or right arrow (→) moves you laterally in the event
list.
✦Pressing Shift while you double-click or pressing Tab/arrow adds events
to your selection.
✦Choosing Go To from the Options drop-down menu takes you to a spe-
cific location in the event list.
✦Selecting the Scroll to Edit Selection option under the Options menu lets
you go automatically to the beginning of the edit selection.
Editing in the MIDI Event List
Editing in the MIDI Event list isn’t for everyone. Many people prefer the
visual format offered by the Edit window, but editing in the MIDI Event List
window can be faster and more accurate. This section describes the process
of inserting, deleting, and editing MIDI data in the MIDI Events List.
Inserting MIDI events
From the Insert menu, as shown in Figure 3-15, you can insert the following
MIDI events into your track:
✦Note: Selecting Note lets you enter the start time, pitch, attack velocity,
release velocity, and either the end time or duration of the notes. 
✦Pitch Bend: When you enter pitch bend information in the Event entry
window, you include start time and the bend amount. Positive values
raise the pitch while negative numbers lower it.
✦Volume: In the Volume Event entry window, enter the start time, con-
troller number (set to 7 for volume), and the volume level (0–17). The
controller name appears in the far-right column.
✦Pan: The Pan Event entry window contains fields for start time, con-
troller number (in this case, set to 10), and pan value (negative numbers
pan left of center, and positive numbers pan right of center). The con-
troller name (pan) appears in the far-right column.

Book V
Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data
Exploring MIDI Events
493
✦Mono Aftertouch: The Mono Aftertouch Event entry window offers
fields for the start time and the after-touch level (0 and 127). After-touch
is the velocity of the note after the initial attack.
✦Poly Aftertouch: The Poly (polyphonic) Aftertouch Event entry win-
dow offers fields for the start time, note name, and the after-touch level
(0 and 127).
✦Program Change: The Program Change Event entry window has fields
for the start time, program number, controller 0 value, and controller 
32 value. (Controller 0 and controller 32 are for sending program bank
change commands. Some MIDI devices use controller 0, others use con-
troller 32, and still others use both. Consult the manual for your MIDI
device to determine which controller value it uses.) The program name
appears when you choose the program number.
✦Controller: This option lets you designate which of the many controller
events you want to enter. The event’s entry window for this option in-
cludes the start time, controller number, and the controller value. The
controller number that you choose determines the controller parameter
you change, and this parameter name shows up in the farthest column
to the right.
✦Another Note: This option enters the data from the previous inserted
event into fields.
To insert a MIDI note using the MIDI Event List, do the following:
1. In the MIDI Event List window, choose Note from the Insert menu.
The Note Event entry window opens at the top of the MIDI event list, as

P
ro Tools offers a handful of MIDI operations (located under the MIDI
section of the main menu) where you can transform a mediocre track
into a stunning performance. (Well, almost, depending on how well you use
these operations.) These operations allow you to make changes to the MIDI
performance data on a track.
In this chapter, you get a chance to dig in to some of the most powerful 
MIDI editing operations in Pro Tools. With these operations in hand, you 
can do some really cool things, such as change the key of a song, alter the
characteristics of a performance, or correct timing problems. This chapter
also leads you through the MIDI Operations window and shows you how 
to perform each of the operations in the window.

Logically enough, the MIDI Operations window is where you do all your 
MIDI operations. This window, as shown in Figure 4-1, is accessed by 
choosing any one of the MIDI operations listed under the Event section of
the main menu, or by choosing Event➪MIDI➪Operations Window from the
main menu.

Getting Used to the MIDI Operations Window

After this window is open, you can select the operation you want to perform
from the drop-down menu at the top of the window.
To close the window, press Return (Mac) or Enter in the alphanumeric 
section of the keyboard (PC) after you click the Apply button to apply the
operation.
From the MIDI Operations window, you can use the following commands as a
fast way to navigate and adjust parameters:
✦Press Tab to move forward through the fields in the window; conversely,
press Shift+Tab to move backward through the fields.
✦Use the up-arrow (↑) and down-arrow (↓) keys to adjust values up and
down in your selected field.
✦In a highlighted field, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) while you drag your
mouse to adjust the value up or down in your selected field’s text box.
✦When adjusting the sliders, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) to increase the
resolution of the sliders while you use them to adjust the values in your
selected field.
✦Play a note on your MIDI controller to select a note in fields with pitch
and velocity settings.

Performing MIDI Operations
MIDI operations are all done from the MIDI Operations window (see the 
previous section). The operations you can perform are listed in the drop-
down menu at the top of the window. In version 6 of Pro Tools, you have the
following operations available to you (as shown in Figure 4-2):
✦Grid/Groove Quantize: Lets you adjust the timing of your selected
notes and to the Quantize operation, except you use a groove template
to create a grid to quantize to if you choose.
✦Restore Performance: Use this option to return to saved performance
settings.
✦Flatten Performance: Use this option to tweak performance data and
lock it in before you do any more tweaking.
✦Change Velocity: Use this to adjust the volume of the attack or the
release of selected MIDI notes.
✦Change Duration: User this to alter the length of recorded MIDI notes.
✦Transpose: User this to change the pitch of selected notes.
✦Select/Split Notes: Use this to choose specific MIDI notes or a range of
notes in a selection, or copy or cut the selected notes.
✦Input Quantize: Use this to set a Quantize value that your recorded 
performance is adjusted to automatically while you record it.
✦Step Input: Use this option to input notes manually, one at a time. You
can control the duration, velocity, and location of each note.

Stay tuned: The following sections look at each of these MIDI operations in
greater detail. If you want to perform any one of them, here’s how:
1. Select the note(s) you want to change.
Book IV, Chapter 2 describes how to make these selections.
2. Select the MIDI operation you want to perform from the Event section
of the main menu. (Or, choose Event➪MIDI➪Operation Window from
the main menu and choose the operation you want from the window’s
drop-down menu.)
3. Make the settings you want in the available fields.
Check out the section for each operation to see what to adjust.
4. Apply the operation by clicking Apply or by using the keyboard:
• To keep the MIDI Operations window open: Press Enter in the number
pad section of the keyboard.
• To close the MIDI Operations window: Press Return (Mac) or Enter in
the alphanumeric section of the keyboard (PC) to apply the opera-
tion and close the MIDI Operations window.
Grid/Groove Quantize
The Grid/Groove Quantize MIDI operation lets you adjust the timing of your
selected notes. This is great when you want to conform the rhythmic place-
ment of your MIDI notes to a grid or you have a problem with a really bad
drummer and you want to fix his timing mistakes.
The Grid/Groove Quantize version of the MIDI Operations window, as shown
in Figure 4-3, contains the following fields:
✦What to Quantize: From this section, choose which part of the note to
quantize:
• Attacks: Selecting this check box sets the quantization to the start of
the selected notes.
• Releases: Selecting this check box quantizes the ends of the notes.
• Preserve Note Duration: Selecting this check box produces different
results depending on whether you choose Attacks or Releases.
With Attacks selected, Preserve Note Duration keeps the end of the
note intact. With Releases selected, the start of the note is left intact.
If both Attacks and Releases are selected, the Preserve Note Duration
option is dimmed.

Performing MIDI Operations
501
✦Quantize Grid: Here is where you choose the resolution of the quantize
grid, from whole notes to sixty-fourth notes. If you choose sixteenth
notes, for example, your notes will move to the nearest sixteenth note
when you quantize.
• Note selector: Choose the note value of your quantize grid from this
drop-down menu. Click the note to select it.
• Tuplet: This check box allows you to select odd note groupings, such
as triplets. When you select this option, you need to fill in the tuplet
value. For example, to create a regular eighth-note triplet, enter 3 in
Time 1; for a quarter-note triplet, enter 3 in Time 2.
• Offset Grid By: Use this option to move the Quantize grid forward or
backward in time by the selected number of ticks. This is helpful for
creating a groove that lies slightly ahead of — or behind — the beat.
• Randomize: Using this option adds a level of randomness to the
quantizing of your selection — no, not to mess up the rhythm, but to
keep it from being too rigid. You can select values between 0 and
100%. Lower values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.
✦Options: Select these items to fine-tune your Grid/Groove Quantize oper-
ation by specifying which notes to quantize and by how much:
• Swing: This option and slider allows you create a swing feel (a dotted-
quarter, eighth-note triplet). You specify a percentage (from 0 to
300); selecting 100% provides a triplet feel.

• Include Within: Here, you specify a range of notes to include.
Selecting this option quantizes only selected notes that fall within
the boundaries you set here (from 0 to 100%); the smaller the
number, the narrower the range of notes affected.
• Exclude Within: Here, you specify a range of notes to exclude from
quantization. Any selected notes that fall within the boundaries you
set here (between 0 and 100%) won’t be quantized.
• Strength: This is, in my opinion, the most useful function in the Pro
Tool Grid/Groove Quantize operation. You can use it to move your
quantized notes by a percentage (from 0 to 100%) rather than just
snapping them right to the grid. Higher numbers keep more strictly
to the grid than do the lower values.
Using the options in these four sections well helps keep a natural feel in your
performance.
The following list explains your options when you want to take the groove
from a recorded performance and apply it to the MIDI sequence of your
track. Just choose one of the templates from the Groove Clipboard in the
Quantize Grid drop-down menu located in the Grid/Groove Quantize version
of the MIDI Operations window (as shown in Figure 4-4).
When you select your groove template, the Grid/Groove Quantize menu
options appear, as shown Figure 4-5.
Figure 4-4:

One limitation of Pro Tools LE is that you can’t create your own groove 
templates. Instead, you either have to use what comes with Pro Tools (which
aren’t bad), buy one from Digidesign, or hunt one from a third-party maker.
Of course, there’s an off chance that you may find some downloadable ones
on the Internet. To find out, I recommend checking out the Digidesign User
Conference Web site at http://duc.digidesign.com (do a search for
Digigroove template).
The options in the Grid/Groove Quantize version of the MIDI Operations
window include the following:
✦Groove template selector: From this drop-down menu, choose a groove
template to apply to your selection. (These templates are located in the
Groove folder within the Pro Tools folder on your system’s hard drive.)
After you choose your template, its content, meter, and tempo informa-
tion show up in the Comments section in the middle of the window. To
see these settings, simply click the Show Comments button.
✦Pre-Quantize: When you have the timing field enabled (see the next sec-
tion), selecting this check box applies the setting in the Quantize version
of the MIDI Operations window to the template before you apply your
selection using the Grid/Groove Quantize settings.
✦Randomize: Selecting this check box adds a level of randomness to the
quantizing of your selection — no, not to mess up the rhythm, but to
keep it from being too rigid. Use the slider to select values between 0%
and 100%. Lower values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.

✦Options: Here’s where you can tinker with your groove:
• Timing: This option lets you adjust the timing of the quantization
applied. A setting of 0% makes no change to the selection; a setting
of 100% places the notes right at the groove template’s grid settings.
A setting of 200% moves the selected notes twice the distance from
the template’s grid locations.
• Duration: This setting changes the duration of the notes to fit the
groove template. A setting of 0% makes no change, a setting of 100%
matches the notes to the groove template, and a setting beyond that
increases or decreases the duration of the original notes according
to their ratio to the notes in the groove template.
• Velocity: This field changes the velocity — the volume — of the quan-
tized notes. Like with the other fields (Timing and Duration), the
lower the number, the less the velocity changes.
✦Slider Settings: You can recall and save the slider settings of the options
with a template.
• Recall with Template: Selecting this check box resets all the option
settings to those that are saved with the template.
• Save: Click this button to save your current option settings. If you
choose Save, you can add any comments about the template, and
they show up in the Comments section of the Grid/Groove Quantize
options of the MIDI Operations window.
Restore Performance
Restore Performance returns you to a saved performance settings. This
operation is like having an Undo for all the other operations listed in this
chapter. Your performance returns to one of two earlier states:
✦The settings saved by using the Flatten Performance command (see the
next section) if you used it
✦Its original settings (if you haven’t saved any other settings)
Using the Restore Performance version of the MIDI Operations window, you
can select from several areas to restore. (See Figure 4-6.)
✦Timing (Quantization): Selecting this check box restores the note’s start
time. If the Duration check box is cleared, the duration of the notes
changes back to what it was originally.

Performing MIDI Operations
505
✦Duration: Selecting this check box restores the length of the note. If you
don’t have the Timing check box selected, the start times of your notes
don’t change but the end times may.
✦Velocity: Selecting this check box restores the volume of the note.
✦Pitch: Well, you know what this restores.
If you use the Grid/Groove Quantize operation when you recorded, you can
remove it by using this operation. Choose the Timing (Quantization) option,
and your original performance is resurrected in all its pristine beauty.
Flatten Performance
Flatten Performance is the operation you use when you want to save the per-
formance data of a selection — timing, duration, velocity, and pitch — as the
“original” setting that the Restore Performance operation (see the previous
section) returns you to. The Flatten Performance version of the MIDI
Operations window is shown in Figure 4-7.
Using this operation allows you to tweak performance data and lock it in
before you do more tweaking. If you don’t like the extra tweaking, you can
just go back to these settings. It’s a little added insurance when you’re 
messing creatively with MIDI data.

Use the Flatten Performance operation to save the following data:
✦Timing (Quantization): The note’s start time. If the Duration check 
box is cleared, the duration of the note changes back to what it was 
originally.
✦Duration: The length of the note.
✦Velocity: The volume of the note.
✦Pitch: Well, you know what that is.
Change Velocity
The Change Velocity version of the MIDI Operations window, as shown in
Figure 4-8, allows you to adjust the volume (velocity in MIDI-speak) of the
attack or release of selected MIDI notes.
This operation is a lifesaver for times when you have a drummer playing an
electronic kit and just one note is weak — or when you need to tame overly
aggressive cymbals.
The Change Velocity options in the MIDI Operations window contain the 
following fields:
✦Change Velocity Of: Here, you choose between the initial attack of 
the note (the Attacks check box) or the release value (the Releases
check box).
Figure 4-8:
Use the
Change
Velocity
options to

Performing MIDI Operations
507
✦Set All To: Selecting this radio button sets all the velocities of the
selected notes to the value in the field. You can ether type the value in
or move the slider to adjust the value up or down.
✦Add: Here, you add a specified value to your existing one. You can either
enter the value in the field or use the slider. Your selected notes will
change velocity by the number you specify.
✦Subtract: Here, you subtract a specified value to your existing one. You
can either enter the value in the field or use the slider. Your selected
notes will change velocity by the number you specify.
✦Scale By: Here, you set a scale for how much the velocities of your
selected notes are to change — a percentage between 1 and 400. (Again,
you can use the slider or type in a number.)
✦Change Smoothly: Use this option to change the velocity of selected
notes gradually over time. This is useful for creating crescendos and
decrescendos. Type in the beginning and end values in the From and To
fields, respectively.
✦Change Smoothly by Percentage: This option is similar to Change
Smoothly (see the preceding bullet) except that you specify a percentage
of change instead of typing in specific numbers. This field is also where
you can use a curve graph to specify how much the notes’ velocity must
increase or decrease; choose a percentage value between –99 and +99.
The curve graph then shows how your setting is implemented.
✦Limit To: Select this option if you want to set a minimum and maximum
range for your Change Velocity settings. You type those values into the
fields. This field will be editable when you check the Randomize options
(listed below).
✦Randomize: Here, you create a random velocity change, specifying it 
as a percentage value between 0 and 100%. For example, if you choose 
a Set All To value of 60 and a Randomize setting of 40%, you end up with
Change Velocity values from 48 to 72.
Be careful if you’re changing groups of notes. Using Add or Subtract for that
purpose can change the relationships between various notes. If you like the
way the original notes sound together, try using the Scale option instead.
This keeps the relationships between notes intact.
Change Duration
Use the Change Duration operation to alter the length of recorded MIDI
notes. The Change Duration version of the MIDI Operations window, shown
in Figure 4-9, contains the following fields:
Book V
Chapter 4
Performing MIDI
Operations

Performing MIDI Operations
508
✦Set All To/Add/Subtract/Scale option: This check box allows you to
choose among several options:
• Set All To: Select this radio button to set the duration of selected
notes to the values in the accompanying fields.
• Add: Here, you add a specified value to your existing one.
• Subtract: Here, you subtract a specified value to your existing one.
• Scale By: Here, you set a scale for how much the velocities of your
selected notes are to change — a percentage between 1 and 400.
✦Legato: This option lets you lengthen your selected notes in one of two
ways:
• Gap: Select this option to lengthen the notes to a point where a spec-
ified gap exists between your selected notes and the following ones.
• Overlap: Use this option if you want to extend the length of your
select notes and have them overlap the following notes.
✦Remove Overlaps and Leave Gap: This option lets you remove any
overlaps between notes of the same pitch. You designate the amount of
the gap in the field to the right.
✦Transform Sustain Pedal to Duration: This option transforms sustain
pedal data for a note and applies it to the duration of the note. Checking
the Delete sustain events after transformation box removes the sustain
data from the MIDI track.
✦Change Continuously: This option give you two different ways to
change the duration of your selection over time. These are:
• In Ticks: Here, you change the length of notes gradually over time,
entering ticks in the From and To fields to specify beginning and end
times for the change in duration. You can also enter a Curve value to
modify the shape of the change. You can either drag the slider or
enter a value in the field from –99 to +99.
• By Percentage: In this field, you apply the duration change smoothly
(see the previous bullet) by a percentage rather than by entering
quarter notes and ticks. You can also adjust the curve of the change,
using values from –99 to +99.
✦Limit Range: Use this setting to specify a minimum and maximum
change duration for the settings you choose.
✦Randomize: Use this field to create a random change in duration, based
on the setting you choose in the fields described here.

Performing MIDI Operations
509
The Change Duration operation is useful for changing the feel of the music
by making your selection either more staccato or legato.
Transpose
Use the Transpose operation to change the pitch of selected notes. Checking
out the Transpose version of the MIDI Operations window, as shown in
Figure 4-10, you see that the Transpose operation offers these ways of 
changing pitch:
✦Transpose By: Use this setting to transpose by octaves or semitones
(one half-step). You can either type in the value or use the sliders to
adjust the setting.
✦Transpose: Here, you type in the note and octave that you want to 
transpose from (in the From field) and to (in the To field). You can also
use the slider to adjust the settings if you prefer.
✦Transpose All Notes To: Selecting this option changes all your selected
notes to the note you designate in the field.
✦Transpose in Key: Here, you can transpose your selected notes by scale
steps.
Transposing using this MIDI operation makes it easy to change the pitch —
in effect, the musical key — of the entire song or region. This is especially
helpful if you decide that the song needs to be in a different key for your
singer to sing well.

Select/Split Notes
The Select/Split Notes operation allows you to choose specific MIDI notes 
or a range of notes in a selection and to move them from the track or copy
them to another track. Your options, as shown in the Select/Split Notes 
version of the MIDI Operations window you see in Figure 4-11, include the
following:
✦All Notes: Use this option to select all the notes in your selection.
✦Notes Between: Use this option to specify the range of notes to select.
You can either use pitch references (C1, B1, and so on) or MIDI note
numbers (0–127) for your selection.

✦Top: Using this option chooses the highest note or notes (depending on
the number you enter) in each chord.
✦Bottom: Using this option selects the lowest note or notes (depending
on the number you enter) in each chord.
You can also choose other criteria to include in your selection of notes,
including
✦Velocity Between: Here, you can select the minimum and maximum
velocities to be included in your selection.
✦Duration Between: Use this option to designate minimum and maximum
note durations.
✦Position Between: You can also control the location of your selected
notes within certain beat and tick locations in each bar. Again, a 
minimum and maximum value determines the start and end points.
After you choose your selection parameters, you need to choose whether
you want to select the notes or to split them. Selecting the Select Notes radio
button simply selects them, but selecting the Split Notes option allows you
to choose from two options:
✦Copy: This command copies your selected notes.
✦Cut: This command removes the selected notes from the original track.
The new location of your copied or cur notes is based upon your choice
from the To drop-down menu:
✦Clipboard: Your notes are placed on the Clipboard.
✦A New Track: This places your selected notes into a new MIDI track.
✦A New Track per Pitch: This places each pitch in its own new track.
If you want to include all continuous MIDI data, select the Include All
Continuous MIDI Data check box.
To select notes, do the following:
1. Make a selection on a track or tracks that contain the notes you want
to select.
Book IV, Chapter 2 has all you need to know about making selections.
2. Choose Event➪MIDI➪Select/Split Notes from the main menu.

3. Enter your note or note range in the window.
Again, your choices here are All Notes, Notes Between, Top, and Bottom.
4. Choose the action for the selected notes (Select Notes or Split Notes).
5. Click Apply.
The Select/Split Notes operation is handy for selecting the snare drum from
a drum sequence before you change its note (pitch) or quantize it.
The Select/Split Notes operation is also handy for taking tom-toms from a
drum sequence and moving them to their own track where you can edit, 
pan, and effect them separately from the rest of the drums. Another useful
thing you can do with Select/Split Notes (keeping the drum-track theme
going) is to make a copy of all the kick-drum notes and put them in another
track where you can process them and add them to the original kick during
mixdown. (Hey, why not get your kicks while you can? Sorry about that.)
To actually split notes from a MIDI track, do the following:
1. Make a selection on a track or tracks that contain the notes you want
to select.
Book IV, Chapter 2 has all you need to know about making selections.
2. Choose Event➪MIDI➪Select/Split Notes from the main menu.
The Select/Split Notes version of the MIDI Operations window appears.
3. Enter your note or note range in the window.
Again, your choices here are All Notes, Notes Between, Top, and Bottom.
4. Choose the Split Notes action and then choose to copy or cut the
selected notes from the track.
5. Select the location you want your split material to go: the Clipboard, 
a new track, or a new track per pitch.
6. Click Apply.
To place the split notes that you placed on the Clipboard into another track,
do the following:
1. Position your cursor in the destination track at the same point as the
start point of your Split Note operation.
2. Press Ô+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (PC) to place the copies or cut notes from
your Clipboard into the track.

Input Quantize
Use the Input Quantize operation to set a Quantize value that your recorded
performance is adjusted to automatically as you record it. The fields you can
adjust in the Input Quantize version of the Operations window (see Figure
4-12) are the same as with the Grid/Groove Quantize operation.
Unless your timing is really bad (or the person you record can’t walk and
chew gum at the same time), I suggest that you disable this function and
quantize — if needed — after your performance is saved. Otherwise, it’s
incredibly easy to overdo the quantizing and end up with a performance
with absolutely no human feel to it.
Step Input
Use the Step Input MIDI operation to add MIDI to a track manually. This can
be handy if you want to “create” a performance that you’re unable to play in
real-time. This can be time-consuming, but it would likely be quicker than
learning to play a really difficult part before recording it.
Figure 4-13 shows the Step Input options in the MIDI Operations window.
Here’s a run-down on the parameters you choose from:
✦Enable: This enables the Step Input function while also disabling any
tracks that were record-enabled. If you have a default MIDI through
instrument chosen (in the MIDI preference menu), it is also disabled.
✦Destination Track: This is the track where your MIDI notes are added.

✦Step Increment: In this section, choose the spacing and duration of your
new MIDI notes. You can choose between whole, half, quarter, eighth,
sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth notes. As well, you can also
choose
• Tuplet: Use this to input triplets by dividing the step increment
selected for Step Increment into the value chosen in the tuplet fields.
For example, if you want to input triplets, select the quarter note in
the Step Increment field, select the Tuplet check box, and then enter
3 and 2 in the fields to the right (so that is reads 3 in Time 2). This
places three notes between quarter notes instead of two.
• Note Length: Use this slider to choose a percentage of the note 
increment you select in the Step Increment section. For example, if
you want a staccato pattern and you chose eighth notes as your 
step increment, you might want to select a 50% value. This will play
the note for only half the total eighth-note duration.
You also have a few options that you choose from when step inputting notes:
✦Use Input Velocity: Selecting this radio button assigns the velocity that
you play on your instrument to the note.
✦Set Velocity To: Use this slider to choose a velocity for this note so 
you don’t have to worry about playing it at the right volume on your
instrument.
✦Enable Numeric Keypad Shortcuts: Selecting this check box allows you
to enter your Step Input options via keyboard shortcuts.

✦Undo Step: Clicking this button removes the last step input. If you have
a note depressed on your MIDI instrument, clicking this changes the title
to Decrement and removes the last step increment that you added to
your track.
✦Next Step: Clicking this button moves you to the next increment, adding
a rest to your track. If you have a note depressed on your MIDI instru-
ment, this button reads Increment and lengthens your note by the step
increment value that you entered in the Step Increment section earlier.
✦Redo Step: Clicking this button replaces the note that was removed by
your previous Undo step operation.
Follow these steps to step input MIDI notes:
1. Choose Event➪MIDI➪Step Input.
The Step Input options in the MIDI Operations window open.
2. Select the Enable check box.
This enables the Step Input function.
3. Choose the MIDI or Instrument track from the Destination Track 
drop-down menu.
4. Choose your note parameters (listed earlier in this section).
5. Play the note on your MIDI instrument.
Your note is placed in the designated track.
Your cursor moves to the next step in your track. Repeat Steps 3–5 for
each additional note you want to add.
Recognizing MIDI Real-Time Properties
Pro Tools allows you to adjust a variety of MIDI properties in real time while
your song plays. This is done from the MIDI Real-Time Properties window.
This feature is handy if you want to make adjustments to certain MIDI data,
such as quantize, note duration, delay, velocity, and transpose, either across
an entire track or a selected region. This section details this process.
Access the Real-Time Properties window by selecting a MIDI or instrument
track or region and by choosing Event➪MIDI Real-Time Properties from the
main menu. The Real-Time Properties window opens, as shown in Figure
4-14. You can also see and edit real-time properties within the Edit window
by choosing View➪Edit Window➪Real-Time Properties.

The Real-Time Properties window consists of the following parameters 
to adjust:
✦Quantize: This section is where you choose the resolution of the quanti-
zation. Your choices range from whole notes to sixty-fourth notes. If you
choose sixteenth notes, for example, your notes will move to the nearest
sixteenth note when you quantize.
• Note: From this drop-down menu, choose the note value of your
quantize grid. Open the drop-down menu by clicking the note. From
here, you can drag to the note value you want as well as add either
triplet or dotted note options. You can also select a groove template
to quantize to.
When you select a note for your grid value. The following options
appear in the window:
• Swing: From this field, create a swing feel (dotted-quarter, eighth-
note triplet). You specify a percentage (from 0 to 300); selecting 100%
provides a triplet feel.
• Tuplet: Select this check to select odd note groupings, such as
triplets. When you select this option, you need to fill in the tuplet
value. For example, to create a regular eighth-note triplet, choose 3
in Time 1; for a quarter-note triplet, choose 3 in Time 2.
• Offset: Selecting this option allows you to move the Quantize grid 
forward or backward in time by the selected number of ticks. This 
is helpful for creating a groove that lies slightly ahead of — or 
behind — the beat.
• Strength: This is, in my opinion, the most useful function in the Pro
Tool Quantize operation. You can use it to move your quantized notes
by a percentage (from 0 to 100%) rather than just snapping them
right to the grid. Higher numbers keep more strictly to the grid than
Figure 4-14:

do the lower values. Checking this check box results in a text field
appearing where you enter the percentage value for this operation.
• Include: Here, you specify a range of notes to include. Selecting this
option quantizes only selected notes that fall within the boundaries
you set here (from 0 to 100%); the smaller the number, the narrower
the range of notes affected.
• Random: Selecting this option adds a level of randomness to the
quantizing of your selection — no, not to mess up the rhythm, but to
keep it from being too rigid. You can select values between 0 and
100%. Lower values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.
✦Duration: From this section, you can change the duration of your
selected notes. You have several options to choose from a drop-down
menu located next to the Duration properties option, including
• Set: Select this option to set the duration of your selected notes to
your desired duration, such as quarter notes or eighth notes. Or, you
can type in a specific number of ticks.
• Add: Here, you can add a specific amount to each selected note. You
can choose between typing in a certain tick value or choosing one of
the notes values that appear in the drop-down menu to the right of
the data field.
• Subtract: Like with Add, selecting this option allows you to subtract
your desired value from your selected notes. Again, you can choose
between typing in a tick value or by choosing a note value.
• Scale: Select the scale option to adjust the duration of your selected
notes by the percentage to designate in the data field. Your options
range from 0% to 400%.
• Legato/Gap: Selecting this option extends your selected notes to the
next note, regardless of how far away it is.
• Legato/Overlap: Select this option to extend your selected notes to
the next note and beyond, creating an overlap (hence the name).
Enter the amount of overlap you want in the data field to the right.
You can narrow the effects of your real-time adjustments for note
durations by setting a minimum note duration that will be changed
by the settings you chose from the preceding above by selecting the
Min and/or Max fields and then entering the value that you want.
✦Delay: Use this property to move your selection a designated amount of
time forward or backward in your session. This can be helpful when
dealing with latencies or creating different feels, such as being “on top
of” (just ahead of) or “behind” (just after) the beat. From the drop-down
menu, choose to either delay or advance your selection. You enter the
amount of this delay or advance in the field using either ticks or sam-
ples, which you choose from the drop-down menu to the right.

✦Velocity: You’ve likely seen this option before. Use this to change to
velocity (volume of the note strike) of your selection. Engaging this
option opens the Real-Time Properties window to include the following
parameters:
• Dyn: Use this parameter to select a percentage value for the velocity
change you want to implement in your selection. You can choose
percentages between 0 and 300.
• Absolute Value: This unlabeled check box sits to the right of the 
Dyn option. Here, you can enter the amount of absolute change of
velocity change you want to all selected notes. You can enter a 
value between –127 and +127.
• Min: Selecting this check box engages a minimum velocity that will
be affected by the selections you make in previous options.
• Max: Selecting this check box engages a maximum velocity that will
be affected by the selections you make in previous options.
Selecting both affects only the selected notes that reside between
the minimum and maximum values.
✦Transpose: Use this option to change the pitch of your selected notes by
the values you select; use one of the following options that exist in the
drop-down menu located to the right of the Transpose title (it’s now
showing “In” key with the text box to the right):
• By: Selecting this transposes your selection by your chosen interval.
Choosing this option from the drop-down menu opens two data fields
in which you can enter octave (the left field) or semitones (the right
field).
• To: Use this to transpose your selection to a specific pitch. Just
select this option form the drop-down menu and enter the pitch in
the data field that appears.
• In: Use this option to transpose in a specific key. Selecting this option
from the drop-down menu adds a data field in which you can enter a
value between –11 and +11. Each number represents a key step.
You can perform the Real-Time Properties functions by using these steps:
1. Open the Real-Time Properties window by choosing Event➪MIDI 
Real-Time Properties or View➪Edit Window➪Real-Time Properties.
The Real-Time Properties window opens. Figure 4-14 show the Real-Time
Properties window that appears when you choose Event➪MIDI Real-

• Track: Click the track to select it.
The name of the track will be highlighted, and that track will show up
in the Apply To section of the Real-Time Properties window.
• Region: Use the Grabber tool and click the region to which you want

To select multiple regions, hold down the Shift key while grabbing.
3. Engage the property you want to use by clicking the particular 
property (Quantize, Duration, Delay, Velocity, or Transpose) within
the Real-Time Properties window.
The property becomes highlighted, and the window expands to include
the controls for your chosen property.
4. Select the parameters that you want for your MIDI property. You can
do this while your session plays, or you can start your session after
you make your selection.
You’ll hear the effects that your settings have on your selection while
your song plays.
5. Make any adjustments you want until you get the effect or change that
you’re looking for.

hink about all the time it took for you to record all the tracks for your
song. You spent countless hours setting up mics; getting good, hot (high,
but not distorting) levels on your instruments; and making sure that each
performance was as good as you could get it. You’d think, then, that most of
your work would be done.
Well, on the one hand, it is because you no longer have to set up and 
record each instrument. On the other hand, you still have to make all the
parts that you recorded fit together. This process can take as long as it 
took you to record all the tracks in the first place. In fact, for many people, 
it takes even longer to mix the song than to record all its parts.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the process of mixing your music. You 
get a chance to see the basics of mixing using the Pro Tools Mix window.
You also discover how to set up external mixing aids, such as MIDI control
surfaces, digital mixers, and analog mixers. To top it all off, you discover
how to reference your music to other people’s recordings as well as how to
train your ears so that your mix “translates” to different types of playback
systems.
Mixing music is very subjective. You can relate one instrument to another 
in an almost infinite variety of ways. You might find that several mixes work
equally well for your song. Allow yourself to experiment — and don’t be
afraid to record several different mixes.

Understanding Mixing
524
Understanding Mixing
The goal of mixing is to make sure that each instrument can be heard in 
the mix — the recorded whole that results from blending all your recorded
parts — without covering up something else or sounding out of place. You
can pull this off in several ways:
✦Choose the parts that add to the emotional impact of the music and
build intensity throughout the song. By necessity, this also means
choosing to not use unnecessary parts or those that clash with parts
that have a greater effect.
✦Set the level (volume) of each instrument relative to the others. That
way, nothing is buried so far back in the mix that you can’t hear it, and
no instrument is so loud that it overpowers the other instruments.
✦Adjust the equalization (EQ, or frequency response) of each instru-
ment. This leaves room for all instruments in the mix. You get rid of any
frequencies of an instrument that clash with those of another, or empha-
size certain frequencies that define the sound of an instrument so it can
be heard clearly in the mix.
✦Take advantage of stereo panning (movement from left to right). This
puts each instrument in its proper place in the stereo field — toward the
left or right — where it can either sound as natural as possible or pro-
duce a desired effect. Also, stereo panning allows you to make room for
each instrument in the mix, especially those with similar frequency
ranges.
✦Add effects (such as reverb or delay) to the instruments in the mix.
You place instruments in front or in back, relative to other instruments,
or to create a desired sound.
During mixing, you can get really creative in crafting your song. The stress of
capturing great performances is over: All that’s left for you to do is to mas-
sage all the parts of your song into a cohesive whole. Don’t be afraid to try
new things. Experiment with different EQ, panning, and effect settings. Take
your time and have fun. The great thing about mixing is that you can make
as many versions as you want — and you can always go back and try again.
Managing Levels as You Work
When you mix all the tracks in your session, the mix bus (which, for its part,
is controlled by the Master fader) is where they end up. There, the signals
are summed (added) and result in a level (volume) that’s higher than that of

Getting Started Mixing Your Song
525
the original tracks. One danger of mixing in-the-box (within Pro Tools) is that
this level can get pretty high, and you might not recognize it unless you
listen very carefully.
While you work, watch the level meter in the Master fader and make adjust-
ments to the individual tracks to bring down the individual levels, rather
than dropping the fader on the master.
Many people like to get the most volume out of a song when mixing, so they
crank up the Master fader to where the levels peak right at 0 decibels (dB) or
maybe –0.1dB. This used to be considered okay, but more and more profes-
sional engineers are backing off on the mix bus by as much as 6dB. This is
what I recommend as well. Keep your peak levels that go to the Master fader
down to about –3dB to –6dB and make this up when you master (or have
someone else master) your music. Sure, the volume will be lower than 
it is on the commercial CDs you own, but you can adjust that during the 
mastering process. (Book VII, Chapter 1 has more on mastering.)
The advantage to keeping down peak levels is that you get better levels
going to the mix bus and reduce the chance that some clipping happens.
(Clipping is also called overs in digital recording; it’s distortion that results
when the summed signals end up too hot and overload the mix bus.)
Getting Started Mixing Your Song
Before I start to mix a song, I do a few things to prepare myself for the
process. My goal before I mix is to get in the headspace of mixing. This often
means taking a step back from the song and approaching it as a listener
rather than as the musician who recorded each track. Start the mixing
process by following these steps:
1. Determine the overall quality you want from the song.
At this point, I don’t mean quality in terms of, “Is it good or bad?” Rather,
I define quality here as a musical style or a feeling. Do you want it to
kick? Soothe? Scream? You probably don’t need to think about this too
hard if you had a definite sound in mind when you started recording. In
fact, most composers hear a song in their heads before they even start
recording.
2. Listen to a song or two from a CD that has a sound or feel similar to
the song you’re trying to mix.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics

Mixing in Pro Tools
526
Listen to the examples on your studio monitors if you can; try to get a
sense of the tonal and textural quality of these songs. Listen to them at
fairly low volume; be careful not to tire your ears. All you’re trying to 
do at this point is get your ears familiar with the sound you’re trying to
produce in your music.
3. Set up a rough mix, using no EQ or effects, and listen through a song
once.
For this listening session, don’t think like a producer; rather, try to 
put yourself in the mindset of the average listener. Listen to the various
parts you recorded — does anything stick out as particularly good or
bad? You’re not listening for production quality. You’re trying to deter-
mine which instruments, musical phrases, licks, melodies, or harmonies
grab you as a listener.
4. Get a piece of paper and a pen to jot down ideas while you work.
When you listen through the song, take notes on where certain instru-
ments should be in the mix. For example, you might want the licks
played on lead guitar throughout the song to be muted during the first
verse. Or, maybe you decide that the third rhythm guitar part you
recorded would be best put way to the right side of the mix, while the
other two rhythm guitar parts might be closer to the center. Write down
these ideas so you can try them later. Chances are that you’ll have a 
lot of ideas as you listen through the first few times.
Mixing in Pro Tools
Pro Tools comes with a powerful software mixer, and everything you 
might want to do can be done via your mouse and keyboard. Even so, many
people — myself included — prefer to mix by using real faders, knobs, and
buttons. This can be done several ways: using a Digi 002 or 003 control 
surface, a MIDI controller, a digital mixer, or an analog mixer. These alterna-
tive types of mixers are covered in more detail in Book I, Chapter 2; for now, 
I just want to cover the basic setups of these various options.
Using the 002 or 003 control surface
If you have a Digi 002 or 003 with the control surface (see Figure 1-1), 
your system is automatically integrated within Pro Tools software. With 
your system hooked up via a FireWire interface, all your faders, knobs, and
buttons should work seamlessly with the software mixer. When you push a
fader on the control surface, the corresponding track fader on the computer
screen moves as well.

Mixing in Pro Tools
527
Check out the manual for the 002 or 003 to get familiar with the operation of
its control options. Or you can just fiddle around a bit; the controller is set
up very intuitively.
Using a MIDI controller
Quite a few MIDI control surfaces on the market work well with Pro Tools.
(The Mackie Control is one that immediately comes to mind.) If you want to
go the MIDI route, check out the compatibility page on the Digidesign Web
site (www.digidesign.com/compato) to see whether the unit you’re inter-
ested in is supported.
Hooking up a MIDI control surface is the same as setting up any MIDI instru-
ment, so go to Book V, Chapter 1 for details on configuring your system.
After you’re hooked up and running, the control surface is basically the
same as using a Digi 002 or 003. All your faders, knobs, and buttons on your
control surface will adjust one of the parameters in the Pro Tools software.
The manual for your MIDI control surface will spell out the function of each
of the buttons. In the case of the Mackie Control, you can get a template that
fits over the surface of the controller and shows you the appropriate func-
tions in Pro Tools listed for easy reference.

Using a digital mixer
If you want to use a digital mixer with your Pro Tools system, you need to
make sure that you have the proper number of digital inputs and outputs in
your Digidesign interface to connect to your mixer.
With the 003 Rack, for example, you have ten outputs (eight ADAT and two
S/PDIF) that you can use to send your tracks from your computer to your
mixer. (Just make sure that your mixer can accept ADAT and S/PDIF signals —
Book I, Chapter 2 has more in ADAT and S/PDIF — at the same time; otherwise,
you’re down to eight.) This means you can send no more than ten tracks of
material to your mixer to mix.
In this example, if you have a session with more than ten tracks, your digital
mixer becomes somewhat useless unless you want to mix in stages (ten
tracks at a time) or mix in the box (within Pro Tools) and from your mixer.
I don’t recommend this half-in-the-box approach because you’ll have a delay
between the internal track and the tracks sent to your mixer. Any such delay
will really mess with the feel of your music.
To connect your digital mixer to your Pro Tools system, simply run the
appropriate cables (ADAT, for instance) from the output of your Digidesign
interface to the input of your digital mixer. When you move a fader (or a
button or a knob) in your mixer, the corresponding fader (or button or knob)
track in the Pro Tools software you see onscreen won’t be affected.
Using an analog mixer
Like with a digital mixer, your ability to mix in an analog mixer is limited by
how many outputs your interface has. In this case, it all depends on the
number of analog outputs you have. For example, the 002 Rack provides
eight analog outputs, so this is the maximum number of tracks you can mix
with an analog mixer at any one time.
Mixing a session with more than eight tracks can be done, but it’s not worth
the hassle (in my opinion) unless you have a really expensive analog mixer.
Inexpensive analog mixers (those less than $10,000, for instance) won’t
sound any better than mixing within Pro Tools.
If you want to mix your session through an analog mixer, just connect 
each analog output from your Digidesign hardware to one of the inputs of
your mixer. In the case of the 002 Rack, you need eight TS cables running

Using the Stereo Field
529
from outputs 1 through 8 to the corresponding inputs of your mixer. (Book I,
Chapter 2 has more on the various cables you meet in the recording world.)
Using the Stereo Field
When you’re at a live concert and you close your eyes, you can hear 
where each instrument is coming from on stage. You can hear that certain
instruments are on the left side of the stage, others are on the right, and 
still others seem to come from the center. You can also generally discern
whether an instrument is at the front or the back of the stage. Put all these
sound-based impressions together, and you have a 3-D image made of 
sound — a stereo field.
What makes up the stereo field is the specific placement of sound sources
from left to right and front to back. When you mix a song, you can set your
instruments wherever you want them on the imaginary “stage” created by
your listener’s speakers. You can do this with panning, which sets your
instruments from left to right. You can also use effects (such as reverb and
delay) to provide the illusion of distance, placing your instruments toward
the front or back in your mix. (See Chapter 4 of this mini-book for more on
effects.) When you mix your song, try to visualize where on stage each of
your instruments might be placed.
Some people choose to set the panning and depth of their instruments to
sound as natural as possible, and others use these settings to create other-
worldly sounds. There is no right or wrong when panning and adding effects
to simulate depth — just what works for your goals. Don’t be afraid to get
creative and try unusual things.
Left or right
You adjust each instrument’s position from left to right in a mix with the
Panning control, located in the Pro Tools Mix window. (See Figure 1-2.)
Panning for most songs is pretty straightforward, and I outline some settings
in the following sections. Some mixing engineers like to keep their instru-
ments toward the center of the mix; other engineers prefer spreading things
way out with instruments on either end of the spectrum. There’s no absolute
right or wrong way to pan instruments. In fact, no one says you have to leave
any of your instruments in the same place throughout the entire song. Just
make sure that your panning choices contribute to the overall effect of the
music. (Check out Chapter 5 of this mini-book for how to automate your 
panning in Pro Tools.)
Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics

530
Lead vocals
Lead vocals are usually panned directly in the center. This is mainly because
the vocals are the center of attention and panning them left or right takes
the focus away from them. Some people will pan the vocals off center if there
is more than one lead vocal (as in a duet), but this can get cheesy real fast
unless you’re very subtle about it. Of course, you’re the artist and you may
come up with a really cool effect moving the vocal around.
Backup vocals
Because backup vocals are often recorded in stereo, they are panned hard
left and hard right. If you recorded only one track of backup vocals, you can
make a duplicate of the track and pan one to each side, just like you can with
stereo tracks.
In addition to tracks panned to each side, some mixing engineers also have 
a third backup vocal track panned in the center to add more depth. Your
choice to do this depends on how you recorded your backup vocals as well
as how many tracks are available for them.
Guitar parts
Lead guitar is often panned to the center, or just slightly off-center if the
sound in the center of the stereo field is too cluttered. Rhythm guitar, on 
the other hand, is generally placed somewhere just off-center. Which side
doesn’t matter, but it’s usually the opposite side from any other background
instruments, such as an additional rhythm guitar, a synthesizer, an organ, 
or a piano.

531
Bass
Typically, bass guitar is panned in the center, but it’s not uncommon for
mixing engineers to create a second track for the bass: panning one to the
far left and the other to the far right. This gives the bass a sense of spacious-
ness and allows more room for bass guitar and kick drum in the mix.
Drums
As a general rule, I (and most other people) pan the drums so that they
appear in the stereo field much as they would on stage. (This doesn’t mean
that you have to, though.) Snare drums and kick drums are typically panned
right up the center, with the tom-toms panned from slightly right to slightly
left. Hi-hat cymbals often go just to the right of center; ride cymbals are just
left of center; and crash cymbals sit from left to right, much like tom-toms.
Percussion
Percussion instruments tend to be panned just off to the left or right of
center. If I have a shaker or triangle part that plays throughout the song, for
instance, I’ll pan it to the right an equal distance from center as the hi-hat is
to the left. This way, you hear the hi-hat and percussion parts playing off one
another in the mix.
Piano/synthesizers/organs
These instruments are usually placed just off-center. If your song has rhythm
guitar parts, the piano or organ usually goes to the other side. Synthesizers
can be panned all over the place. In fact, synths are often actively panned
throughout the song: That is, they move from place to place.
Front or back
As you probably discovered when you were placing your mics to record an
instrument, the quality of sound changes when you place a mic closer to —
or farther away from — the instrument. The closer you place the mic, the
less room ambience you pick up, which makes the instrument sound closer
to you, or “in your face.” By contrast, the farther from the instrument you
place your mic, the more room sound you hear: The instrument sounds far-
ther away.
Think of standing in a large room and talking to someone to see (well, hear,
actually) how this relationship works. When someone stands close to you
and talks, you can hear him clearly. You hear very little of the reflections of
his voice from around the room. As he moves farther away from you, though,
the room’s reflections play an increasing role in the way that you hear him.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics

Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
532
By the time the other person is at the other side of the room, you hear not
only his voice but also the room where you’re at. In fact, if the room is large
enough, the other person probably sounds as if he were a mile away from
you, and all the reflections from his voice bouncing around the room may
make it difficult to understand what he says.
You can easily simulate this effect by using your reverb or delay effects
processors. In fact, this is often the purpose of reverb and delay in the
mixing process. With them, you can effectively “place” your instruments
almost anywhere that you want them, from front to back, in your mix.
The less reverb or delay you use with your instrument, the closer it appears
on the recording; the more effect you add to an instrument, the farther away
it seems.
The type of reverb or delay setting that you use has an effect on how close
or far away a sound appears as well. For example, a longer reverb decay or
delay sounds farther away than a shorter one.
In Chapter 4 of this mini-book, I go into detail about the various effects
processors to help you understand how best to use them. I also present 
settings you can use to create natural-sounding reverb and delay on your
tracks, as well as some unusual settings that you can use for special effects.
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
After you have a rough mix and get your EQ (described in Chapter 3 of this
mini-book) and panning settings where you want them, your next step is to
determine which parts of which tracks are used when — and sometimes
whether a part or track is used at all. If you’re like most musician/producers,
you try to get all the wonderful instrumental and vocal parts you recorded
as loud as possible in the mix so that each brilliant note can be heard clearly
all the time. After all, you didn’t go through all the time and effort to record
all those great tracks just to hide them in the mix or (worse yet) mute them,
right?
Well, I feel your pain. But when you get to the mixing point of a song, it’s 
time to take off your musician’s hat and put on the one that reads Producer.
And a producer’s job is to sort through all the parts of a song, choose those
that add to its effect, and dump those that are superfluous or just add 
clutter. Your goal is to assemble the tracks that tell the story you want to 
tell and that carry the greatest emotional impact for the listener.

Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
533
This can be the toughest part of mixing your own songs because you aren’t
likely to be totally objective when it comes to determining what to use and
what not to use. Try not to get stressed out. You aren’t erasing any of your
tracks, so you can always do another mix if you just have to hear the part
that you muted before.
One of the great joys when listening to music (for me, anyway) is hearing a
song that carries me away and pulls me into the emotional journey that the
songwriter had in mind. If the song is done well, I’m sucked right into the
song; by the end, all I want to do is listen to it again.
What is it about certain songs that can draw you in and get you to feel the
emotion of the performers? Well, aside from a good melody and some great
performances, it’s how the arrangement builds throughout the song to
create tension, release that tension, and build it up again. A good song builds
intensity so that the listener feels pulled into the emotions of the song.
Generally, a song starts out quiet, becomes a little louder during the first
chorus, and then drops down in level for the second verse (not as quiet 
as the first, though). The second chorus is often louder and fuller than the
first chorus, and is often followed by a bridge section that is even fuller yet
(or at least differs in arrangement from the second chorus). The loud bridge
section might be followed by a third verse where the volume drops a little.
Then a superheated chorus generally follows the last verse and keeps 
building intensity until the song ends.
When you’re crafting the mix for your song, you have two tools at your 
disposal to build and release intensity: dynamics and instrumental content
(the arrangement).
Dynamics
Dynamics are simply how loud or soft something is — and whether the loud-
ness is emotionally effective. Listen to a classic blues tune (or even some
classical music), and you’ll hear sections where the song is almost deafen-
ingly silent, and other sections where you think the band is actually going to
step out of the speakers and into your room. This is an effective and power-
ful use of dynamics. The problem is that this seems to be a lost art, at least
in popular music.
It used to be that a song could have very quiet parts and really loud ones.
Unfortunately, a lot of CDs nowadays have only one level — loud. This often
isn’t the fault of the musicians or even the band’s producer. Radio stations
and record company bean counters have fueled this trend, betting that if 
Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics

Tuning Your Ears
534
a band’s music is as loud as (or louder than) other CDs on the market, it’ll
attract more attention and sell more copies. (You can read more about this
trend in Book VII, Chapter 1.) But consider this: Whether you can hear the
music is one thing; whether it’s worth listening to is another.
Try recording a song with a lot of dynamic changes. I know this bucks the
trend, but who knows? You might end up with a song that carries a ton of
emotional impact. Also, while you mix your song, incorporate dynamic 
variation by dropping the levels of background instruments during the
verses and bringing them up during the chorus and bridge sections of the
song. You can always eliminate your dynamic variation (if you absolutely
have to) by squashing your mix with compression during the mastering
process.
The biggest mistake that most people make when they mix their own music
is to try to get their song as loud as commercial CDs. This is the mastering
engineer’s job, however, and not yours, so don’t worry about it. Get your
song to sound good with a balance between high and low frequencies and
loud and soft sections. Let the mastering engineer make your music as loud
as it can be. He or she definitely has gear that is better designed to raise the
volume of a recording without making it sound squashed or harsh.
The arrangement
Building intensity with the arrangement involves varying the amount of
sound in each section. A verse with just lead vocal, drums, bass, and an
instrument playing the basic chords of the song is going to have less inten-
sity (not to mention volume) than a chorus awash with guitars, backup
vocals, drums, percussion, organ, and so on. Most songs that build intensity
effectively start with fewer instruments than they end with.
When you mix your song, think about how you can use the instruments to
add to the emotional content of your lyrics. For example, if you have a guitar
lick played at every break in the vocal line, think about using it less to leave
space for lower levels at certain points in your song. If you do this, each 
lick will provide more impact for the listener and bring more to the song’s
emotion.
Tuning Your Ears
To create a mix that sounds good, the most critical tools you need are your
ears because your capability to hear the music clearly and accurately is
essential. To maximize this capability, you need a decent set of studio moni-
tors and a good idea how other people’s music sounds on your speakers. You

Tuning Your Ears

also need to make sure that you don’t mix when your ears are tired. The fol-
lowing sections explore these areas.
Listening critically
One of the best ways to learn how to mix music is to listen to music that you
like — and listen, in particular, for how it’s mixed. Put on a CD of something
similar to your music (or music with sound that you like) and ask yourself
the following questions:
✦What is the overall tonal quality or texture of the song? Notice how
the frequencies of all the instruments cover the hearing spectrum. Does
the song sound smooth or harsh, full or thin? Try to determine what you
like about the overall production.
✦How does the song’s arrangement contribute to its overall feel? Listen
for licks or phrases that add to the arrangement. Notice whether the
song seems to get fuller as it goes on.
✦Where are the instruments in the stereo field? Notice where each
instrument is, from left to right and front to back, in the mix. Listen to
see whether they stay in one place throughout the song or move around.
✦What effects are being used on each instrument? Listen for reverb and
delay — in particular, how they affect decay lengths — as well as for the
overall effect level compared to the dry (unaffected) signal.
✦What tonal quality does each instrument have? Try to determine the
frequencies from each instrument that seem dominant. Pay particular
attention to how the drums sound, especially the snare drum. You’ll
notice a good mix lets all the instruments fit without fighting one
another. Drums can take up a lot of room in the mix if you don’t narrow
them down to their essential frequencies.
Even if you’re not mixing one of your songs, just sit down once in a while and
listen to music on your monitors to get used to listening to music critically.
Also, the more well-made music you hear on your monitors, the easier it is to
know when your music sounds good on those same speakers.
A good mix should sound good on a variety of systems, not just through the
speakers in your studio. Before you decide that a mix is done, copy it onto 
a CD and play it in your car, your friend’s stereo, and a boom box. In fact, try
to listen to your music on as many different kinds of systems as you can. 
As you listen, notice whether the bass disappears or becomes too loud or
whether the treble becomes thin or harsh. Basically, you’re trying to deter-
mine where you need to make adjustments in your mix so that it sounds
good everywhere.

Unless you spent a lot of time and money getting your mixing room to sound
world-class, you’ll have to compensate when you mix to get your music to
sound good on other people’s systems. If your room or speakers enhance
the bass in your song, the same tracks will sound thin on other people’s 
systems. On the other hand, if your system lacks bass, your mixes will be
boomy when you listen to them somewhere else.
Choosing reference CDs
A reference CD can be any music that you like or that helps you to hear 
your music more clearly. For the most part, choose reference CDs that have
a good balance between high and low frequencies and that sound good to
your ear. That said, some CDs are mixed really well, which can help you get
to know your monitors and train your ears to hear the subtleties of a mix. 
I name a few in the following list. (Disclaimer: I try to cover a variety of
music styles in this list, but I can’t cover them all without a list that’s 
pages long.)

✦Lyle Lovett, Joshua Judges Ruth
✦Norah Jones, Come Away with Me

Tuning Your Ears
537
All commercial CDs have been mastered. This is going to affect their sound a
little: Most importantly, they’ll be louder than your music in its premastered
form. If you toggle between your mix and a reference CD, adjust the relative
levels so that each one sounds equally loud coming through your speakers.
The louder song always sounds “better.” And whatever you do, don’t try to
match the volume of your mix to a reference CD.
Dealing with ear fatigue
If you’ve ever had a chance to mix a song, you might have found that you do
a better mix early on in the process — and the longer you work on the song,
the worse the mix gets. In most cases, this is because your ears get tired —
and when they do, hearing accurately becomes harder. To tame ear fatigue,
try the following:
✦Don’t mix at the end of the day, especially after doing any other
recording. Save your mixing for first thing in the morning when your
ears have had a chance to rest.
✦Keep the volume low. I know you’ll be tempted to crank the volume on
your song while you work on it, but doing so only tires your ears prema-
turely and can cause damage, especially if you have monitors that can
get really loud.
✦Take a break once in a while. Just 10 or 15 minutes of silence can allow
you to work for another hour or so. Also, don’t be afraid to walk away
from a mix for a day or more.
✦Try not to mix under a deadline. This suggestion fits with the preced-
ing one. If you’re under a deadline, you can’t give yourself the time you
need to rest and reassess your mix before it goes to print.
Making several versions
One great thing about digital recording is that it costs you nothing to make
several versions of a mix. All you need is a little (well, actually a lot of) hard
drive space. Because you can make as many variations on your song’s mix as
your hard drive allows, you can really experiment by trying new effects set-
tings or trying active panning in your song and see whether you like it. You
might end up with something exciting. At the very least, you end up learning
more about your gear. That’s always a good thing.
Print (that is, make a clear recording of) a mix early on. Most of the time,
your best mixes happen early in the mixing process. Print (or save) the first
good mix you make before you try making more “creative” ones. That way, 
if you get burned out or run out of time, you still have a decent mix to fall
back on.

efore you can actually mix anything in Pro Tools, you have to get 
a few preliminaries out of the way first. More specifically, you need to
become familiar with the Mix window, have a good grasp of how the signal
flows through the system, know how to create auxiliary inputs and master
faders, and get up to speed on inserts and sends. This chapter gives you the
details on all these things.
Revisiting the Mix Window
When you mix in Pro Tools, you spend most of your time working in the 
Mix Window, as shown in Figure 2-1. The Mix window contains the channels
strips for each track, routing information, and your master faders. Each part
of the Mix window is covered in detail in Book II, Chapter 4.
To open the Mix window, choose Window➪Mix from the main menu or press
Ô+= (equal sign; Mac) or Ctrl+= (equal sign; PC). You can then set up the
display parameters of the window by choosing View➪Mix Window from the
main menu and choosing the options you want included in the view, as
shown in Figure 2-2.

541
Getting to Know Signal Flow
Knowing how the tracks you record are routed through Pro Tools can 
help you make the best choices and keep your sound top-notch while you
mix your song. Figure 2-3 shows how the signal (represented by the regions
in your audio tracks) flows through the track channels in the Pro Tools
mixer (shown in the Mix window).
The audio enters the mixer at the top of the diagram and flows downward.
From top to bottom, the channel strip contains the following sections:
✦Source: This is the audio recorded to your hard drive; or, if you have the
track record-enabled, the signal coming from the input you selected in
the Input section of the channel strip. The signal starts here and enters
the Track’s channel strip.
✦Insert: This lets you insert effects into your track. Inserts in Audio and
Auxiliary Input tracks occur before the fader (pre-fader) for the track.
Inserts on the Master fader tracks occur after the fader (post-fader).
✦Send Pre-fader: This lets you send your signal to an Auxiliary Input
track where you can then insert an effect.
✦Mute: This button lets you mute (turn off) the output of the track.
✦Fader: This lets you control the level (volume) of your signal leaving the
track and going to the output(s) you choose in the Output section of the
channel strip.
✦Send Post-fader: When you have the Pre button disengaged, your Send
signal is sent from your track after it passes through the track fader.
Adjusting the volume of the track also adjusts the level going through
your send.
✦Pan: This lets you adjust how much of your signal goes to the left or
right channel of your stereo output. This option is available only if your
Output setting is set for stereo.
✦Output: This is where your signal goes as it leaves the track’s channel
strip. This can be the master bus, or an effect or submix bus (controlled
by an Auxiliary Input track).
To create a new track (audio, MIDI, auxiliary input, or Master fader), choose
Track➪New from the main menu to call up the New Track dialog box, where
you can choose the type of track you want to create. (Book III, Chapter 1
covers this process in detail.)

Rounding Out Your Routing
When you start mixing in Pro Tools, it helps to have few routing setups
under control. You need a Master fader so you can control the volume leav-
ing Pro Tools, and you need to know how to use the Insert and Send portions
of the channel strip so that you can insert effects into your tracks. The 
following sections outline these procedures.

If you’re using version 6 or later, you can make a track inactive by
Ô+Control-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl+Windows-clicking (PC) the Track Type 
indicator in the lower right of the track’s channel strip (as shown in Figure
2-4). This frees up processing power, which I recommend for any tracks in
your session that you don’t want to play.
Using a Master fader
You use a Master fader to control the level coming out of all the tracks routed
to it. Here’s a short list of a few of the things you can do with a Master fader:
✦Control the main level of your mix. This is the standard use of this
fader. All your tracks are routed to the Master fader, and you use it to
control the overall level going to your monitors.
✦Control submix levels. To control submix levels, route the tracks that
you want to submix to one of your buses and assign the input of the
Master fader to this bus. The output of this Master fader goes to your
Master bus. You can set the individual levels of the submixed track at
each track’s fader and the combined level at this submix’s Master fader.

✦Control effect-send levels. You can route your sends — signals going
through the Send section of your track — to a bus and designate that
bus as the input of a Master fader. You can then insert your effect into
this Master fader’s input, setting the resulting output to go to your mix
bus’ Master fader.
✦Add effects to your entire mix. You can add effects, such as compres-
sion or reverb, to the entire mix by placing it in the insert of the 
Master fader.
To create a Master fader, follow these steps:
1. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case, choose Master Fader) and whether you want your
tracks(s) in stereo.
3. Click Create.
The Master fader appears in your session.
4. Click the Master fader’s Output selector — the second of the three 
buttons in the middle of the channel strip — and set it to the output
that you want it to control.
If you want to make this the Master fader for your main mix bus, set this
to the main outputs that all your tracks are routed to.
Adding auxiliary inputs
Auxiliary inputs are pretty much like audio tracks except that they receive a
signal from within Pro Tools instead of from some external source (such as a
microphone). Auxiliary inputs let you route internally and are great for some
vital mixing tasks such as
✦Sending several tracks to a single effect processor: This can reduce the
stress on your system and can help you to make your tracks sound more
cohesive — by blending their reverb sounds together, for example.
✦Controlling a submix with a single fader: Submixing combines tracks
before they are mixed by the Master bus. Chapter 7 in this mini-book
details how to perform a submix in Pro Tools.
✦Inputting audio signals from your MIDI devices: This lets you monitor
the output from your MIDI devices when your MIDI tracks trigger them.
To create an auxiliary input track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.

Rounding Out Your Routing
545
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case, choose Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your
tracks(s) in stereo.
3. Click Create.
The auxiliary input appears in your session.
4. Click the track’s Input selector — the topmost of the three buttons in
the I/O section of the channel strip — and choose the source for this
track.
This can be an internal bus or a hardware input.
5. Click the Output selector — the second of the three buttons in the
middle of the channel strip — and set it to the output you want to
send the signal.
Inserting inserts
Inserts are effects that you can place into a track’s signal to alter its sound.
For example, inserting a compressor lets you control the dynamic range of
your track, and inserting a delay can add an echo effect to your instrument.
You can have up to five inserts in each track in Pro Tools. You can use either
hardware or software (plug-in) effects in these inserts.
The signal passes through the effects in the order — from top to bottom —
in which they appear in the Insert section of your track’s channel strip. For
example, in Figure 2-5, the signal goes through the compressor before it goes
through the reverb. To change the order of your insert, simply click and drag
it up or down the list.
To insert an effect into a track’s channel strip, follow these steps:
1. Enable the Insert view in the Mix window by choosing View➪Mix
Window➪Inserts from the main menu.
The Insert section of the Mix window appears at the top of your track’s
channel strip.
Figure 2-5:

2. Click an entry in the Insert section to open the drop-down menu.
3. Select a plug-in to insert (or the hardware output/input you want if
you’re using an external effect).
If you choose a plug-in, the plug-in window opens. (See the “Playing with
Plug-ins” section, later in this chapter, for more information.)
Turning off the effect in an insert
Here are the three ways to turn off the effect in an insert:
✦Remove the insert. To remove the insert from the track, choose No
Insert from the Insert drop-down menu. (Click and hold over the arrows
located to the left of the Insert name to access the menu.) This removes
the insert from the track and moves any inserts below it up the line.
✦Bypass the effect. Do this by engaging the Bypass button in the plug-in
window. To open this window, click the Insert name in the Insert section
of the track’s channel strip. This keeps the effect inline but turns it off.
The effect still draws processing power even though you don’t hear it.
✦Make the insert inactive. Do this by pressing Ô+Control (Mac) or
Ctrl+Windows (PC) while you click the plug-in’s name in the Insert sec-
tion of the channel strip. Doing so removes the effect from the signal
chain but not from the Insert section. This frees up processing resources
and allows you to turn on the insert at any time. (You simply repeat the
keystrokes-and-click you used to turn it off.)
Setting up sends
You can send the signal from your track to another bus for processing. Pro
Tools lets you have up to five such sends per audio or auxiliary track. Sends
are useful for two major purposes:
✦Applying effects to more than one track, which you can do internally
(using a plug-in) or externally (using a hardware device)
✦Creating submixes that combine several tracks into one or two tracks
You can choose to send the signal pre-fader or post-fader, which means 
the signal going to the send is either sent before or after it travels through
the track’s fader. The Pre-Fader or Post-Fader options, along with the Send
Level, Panning, and Mute options, are accessed through the Send window, as
shown in Figure 2-6. You access this window by clicking the Send name in
the Send section of the track’s channel strip. If the Send section isn’t visible
in the track’s channels strip, enable the Send view in the Mix window by
choosing View➪Mix Window➪Sends from the main menu.

Rounding Out Your Routing
547
To assign a send, follow these steps:
1. Enable the Send view in the Mix window by choosing View➪Mix
Window➪Sends from the main menu.
The track channel strips expand to include the Sends section, located
between the Inserts and I/O sections of the channel strip.
2. Click one of the entries in the Send section to open the entry’s 
drop-down menu.
3. Select the bus or hardware output/input to which you want to send
the signal.
The Send window opens.
4. In the Send window, select Pre-Fader or Post-Fader.
Selecting Pre-Fader sends the signal from your track before the fader
control for that track and selecting Post-Fader sends the signal after it
passes through the channel’s fader.
5. While still in the Send window, adjust your level, panning, and mute
settings.
To assign an effect to this sent signal, follow these steps:
1. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.

2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case, choose Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your
tracks(s) in mono or stereo.
3. Click Create.
The auxiliary input appears in your session.
4. Assign the input for this auxiliary track to the bus that you chose for
your send destination in the previous list.
5. Follow the steps for inserting an effect into a track.
See the earlier section, “Inserting inserts.”
Viewing sends
You can view your sends, send controls, and send assignments by opening
the following windows in your session:
✦Send A-E Views: You can see the controls for a send in the track’s 
channels strip by choosing Views➪Sends A-E from the main menu,
where A-E represents a listing of the sends you have available to 
work with.
✦Send View Level Meters: If you want to add to the basic Send view 
(see the previous bullet) to include level meters for the Send signal,
select Show Meters in Sends View on the Display tab of the Preferences
dialog box. (Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu to access
this dialog box.)
✦Send Assignments: You can show Send assignments for your tracks by
choosing View➪Sends A-E (or F-J)➪Assignments from the main menu.
This lets you see the names of the sends assigned to a track.
✦Send Output Window: You can open a window that contains all the Send
settings in a large format by clicking the name of the Send in the Send 
section of the track’s channels strip. This Send Output window is explained
further in the upcoming section, “Accessing Output Windows.”
✦Send Names: As one more way to stay organized, you can name the 
destination buses for your sends. Do so by choosing Setup➪I/O from 
the main menu and then clicking the Bus tab on the I/O Setup dialog 
box. On the Bus tab, double-click the name of one of the buses (to 
highlight it) and then type in its new name, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Rounding Out Your Routing
549
Turning off the effect in a send
Here are three ways to turn off the effect in a send:
✦Remove the send. To remove the send from the track, choose No Send
from the Send drop-down menu. (Click and hold over one the arrows in
the Send section of a track’s channel strip to open the drop-down
menu.) This removes the send from the track and moves any other
sends below it up the line.
✦Bypass the effect. Do this by engaging the Bypass button in the plug-in
window. This keeps the effect inline but turns it off. The effect still draws
processing power even though you don’t hear it. To open the plug-in
window, click the name of the plug-in in the track that this plug-in is
inserted into. The Bypass button is located at the top of the window.
✦Make the send inactive. Do this by pressing Ô+Control (Mac) or
Ctrl+Windows (PC) while you click the send bus’ name in the Sends list.
Doing so removes the effect from the signal chain but not from the Sends
list. Making a send inactive frees processing resources, but you can still
turn on the send at any time. (Simply repeat the keystrokes-and-click
you used to turn it off.)

Using sends for groups
Controlling the send level and mute for sends across an entire group can be
an enormous help because you can use one set of controls for all the tracks
in a group. To control sends for a group, do the following:
1. Choose Modify Groups from the Mix Groups drop-down menu.
You can find this in the lower left-hand corner of the Edit window.
The Modify Groups dialog box appears.
2. Check the Send Levels option and/or the Send Mutes option under the
Linked Within Groups section of the Modify Groups dialog box.
This sets it up so that the following happens:
• If you select Enable Sends: Any send level change you make on one
track in the group affects all the tracks in a group.
• If you select Send Mutes: Any send mutes that you create on one track
in the group affect all the tracks in a group.
For more on group sends, see Chapter 6 in this mini-book.
3. Click OK.
Accessing Output Windows
Output windows are floating sections of either the channel strip or the send
settings. These windows allow you to adjust Output controls without having
to search for them in the Mix window. This section details the Send and the
Track Output windows.
Tackling Track Output windows
Track Output windows contain Fader, Pan, Automation, Output Selector,
Solo, and Mute controls, as shown in Figure 2-8.
To open a Track Output window, just click the Output Window button in 
the track’s channel strip in the Mix window, as shown in Figure 2-9.
The track output window includes the following controls:
✦Close: Clicking this button closes the window.
✦Path Meter View Box: When you click this button (the last button to 
the right at the top of the window), another window opens, showing the
meters for the output path you selected in the Path Selector box. (See
the upcoming Path Selector bullet.)

✦Output Selector: From this box, you can choose from among the outputs
(whether track or send) in your system.
✦Path Selector: This button lets you choose the output path for the 
current track.
✦Automation Safe: Clicking this button puts the track in Automation Safe
mode where no new automation data can be written. (Chapter 6 in this
mini-book has more on automation data.)
✦Target: Engaging this button keeps this track’s window open if you click
another Track or Send Output window. With the Target button disen-
gaged (the button is red), whenever you open a send in the Output
Selector box (see the earlier bullet) or another track’s Output Window
button, the current track is replaced by the new Track or Send Output
window.
✦Inverse Pan: For stereo tracks, this button ensures that when you move
one of the pan controls (left or right), the other moves to exactly the
opposite side. Make sure that the Panner Link button (see next bullet) is
depressed so this function can work.
✦Panner Link button: This button links the two pan controls on a stereo
track. With this button engaged, moving one panning slider also moves
the other to the same location; when the button is not engaged, you can
move each panning control independently.
✦Pan controls: These adjust the pan setting for the track.
✦Track fader: This adjusts the volume of the track.
✦Track meter: This display shows the level of the track as the session
plays.
✦Mute: Depressing this button mutes the track.
✦Solo: Clicking this button solos the track.
✦Automation Mode: From this drop-down menu, you choose the 
automation mode for your track.
Setting up the Send Output window
The Send Output window, as shown in Figure 2-10, shows the same basic
information as the Track Output window (refer to Figure 2-8), with two
exceptions:

✦Send Selector: Instead of viewing and selecting the output for the track
(Output Selector), you can choose any of the five sends for the track.
✦Pre/Post button: This button controls whether the send is located
before (pre) or after (post) the track’s fader control. This is the button
marked Pre, located just below the name of the track that feeds this
send. Engaging this button sends the signal before the fader (pre-fader),
and leaving the button untouched sends the signal after the fader 
(post-fader).
To open a Send Output window, just click the Send name in the track’s Send
list in the Mix window.
Playing with Plug-ins
Whenever you want to process tracks in Pro Tools — add EQ, effects, or
dynamics processors — you use a plug-in. Plug-ins are audio-processing 
tools that change the sound of your original file. Some plug-ins permanently
alter the original file and work offline (that is, processing happens without
playing the session). This is the case with pitch-shifting, for example. Other
plug-ins — reverb, for example — affect the audio file without permanently
changing it, processing the audio in real time while the session plays.

These two types of audio processing — offline and real-time — are some of
the more powerful mixing tools available to you in Pro Tools. With them, you
can EQ your tracks and add compression, reverb, delay — and a myriad of
other enhancements — to your music. Your only limitations are the plug-ins
you have at your disposal and the processing power of your computer. The
following sections introduce you to the two types of plug-ins — RTAS (Real
Time AudioSuite) and AudioSuite — and then show you how to route your
system so you can use them effectively.
Real Time AudioSuite (RTAS)
RTAS plug-ins process your audio while your session plays, allowing you to
make adjustments on the fly and be able to hear these changes immediately.
This is handy for adding compression, delay, and reverb, for example. The
drawback to this is that anytime you process as your session plays, you’re
using up more of your computer’s processing power — sometimes a lot
more, as in the case of reverb. The following sections lay out the basics of
using RTAS plug-ins; see Chapters 3–5 in this mini-book for more detailed
information.
Routing your RTAS plug-ins
RTAS plug-ins are like the effects processors that you plug into your mixer.
The sound from your tracks are sent to these effects and routed back
through the mixer so you can hear the affected sound.
The two ways to place these effects in your mixer within Pro Tools are by
using inserts or by using sends and returns. (Check out the earlier section,
“Rounding Out Your Routing,” for more on inserts and sends.)
✦Inserts: Inserting a plug-in basically involves putting the effect inline
with the audio as it travels through the channel strip in your mixer. This
means all the sound from the audio file passes through the effect on its
way out of the mixer (and to your ears).
When you insert a plug-in, you can choose from three formats:
• Mono in/mono out: One channel goes in and one comes out of the
effect.
• Mono in/stereo out: One channel goes in, and two come out.
• Stereo in/stereo out: Two channels go in, and two channels come out.
✦Sends: Using a send for your effects lets you route a portion of your
track’s signal that you can then control with the Send level. These sends
are routed to an auxiliary track, into which the effect is inserted. Thus,
you can route more than one track to a single effect.

Understanding the RTAS Plug-In window
When you select a plug-in (or click its name in the Inserts section of a track’s
channel strip), a window opens, displaying all the controls for the plug-in, as
shown in Figure 2-11. Most plug-ins usually have controls at the top of the
window similar to the ones described in the following list:
✦Track Selector: This control lets you choose to view the plug-ins for any
of the tracks in your session (except MIDI). Selecting a track without a
plug-in shows no insert.
✦Insert Position Selector: Use this to access any insert on the current
track.
✦Plug-In Selector: From this menu, choose from any RTAS plug-in that’s
located in your Plug-Ins folder (the one located within the Pro Tools
folder on your hard drive).
✦Effect Bypass Button: This button (surprise, surprise) bypasses the
effect, allowing you to quickly and easily compare the affected and 
unaffected sounds. A bypassed effect shows as blue in the Mix and the
Edit windows. If you bypass some (but not all) of a multi-mono effect,
the effect shows as purple in the Mix and the Edit windows. This makes
it easy for you to see whether one of your effects is bypassed without
having to open all your Plug-In windows.
✦Settings menu: Clicking and holding on the arrows at the left side of 
the plug-in window accesses the Settings drop-down menu, as shown in
Figure 2-12, which lets you save, copy, paste, import, delete, and lock
your plug-ins’ settings, as well as set plug-in preferences (such as where
to store these settings).

✦Preset list button: Click this button to open the plug-in preset list, from
which you can select the preset you want.
✦Compare button: Click this button to toggle between your current and
your previous setting.
✦Auto button: Clicking this button opens the Plug-In Automation dialog
box, from which you can set automation for your selected plug-in 
parameters. (Chapter 6 in this mini-book has more on automation.)
✦Automation Safe button: Engaging this button keeps any written
automation data from being overwritten.
✦Master Link button: Enabling this button allows you to control all 
channels of a multi-mono plug-in at once. You can see the channels of
your session in the gray box above this button. The small black square
represents the channels. In Figure 2-11, you see two because this is a
stereo session. The left square represents your left channel, and the
right square represents your right channel.
✦Channel selector: This button lets you choose the channel to adjust for
the plug-in.
✦Target button: Depressing this button keeps the current Plug-In window
open when you open another plug-in. With this button off, clicking the
plug-in name in a track’s insert replaces the open window with a new
window.

✦Phase Invert button: This button (not available on all plug-ins) allows
you to reverse the phase of the audio passing through the plug-in. This
means flipping the waveform top to bottom. Book IV, Chapter 1 has more
on waveforms.
Working with RTAS plug-ins
Chances are that you’ll spend quite a bit of time using plug-ins. Unless you
have a control surface, you’ll probably end up spending more time than 
necessary just mouse-jockeying the controls. In the following list, I offer
some shortcuts to make working with plug-ins quicker and easier:
✦To make fine adjustments with your mouse: Press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC)
while you drag the plug-in control.
✦To return a control to its default setting: Press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC)
while you click that control.
✦To move through the controls in a plug-in: Press the Tab key on your
keyboard. To go backward, press Shift+Tab.
✦For plug-in parameters that offer kilohertz (kHz) values: Press the K
key after the number of kilohertz you want to enter. For example, to
enter 10 kHz, type 10k.
✦To increase the value of a parameter without using your mouse: Press
the up-arrow key (↑) on your keyboard; to decrease a value, press the
down-arrow key (↓).
✦To enter a value via your keyboard: Type in the value in the parameter
box and then press Return/Enter.
Using AudioSuite offline plug-ins
Pro Tools comes with a variety of offline plug-ins — that is, effects that you
can use to process your tracks so that you end up either altering the original
audio file or creating a new one. These types of plug-ins are listed under
AudioSuite in the main menu. Figure 2-13 shows the AudioSuite menu. Each
item expands to include all plug-ins available for that plug-in type.

When you select a plug-in from the AudioSuite menu, a window opens, 
containing all the controls for the plug-in, as shown in Figure 2-14. You’re
going to find the same kinds of controls for nearly all the plug-ins. They
include the following:
✦Plug-in Selector: From this menu, choose from any AudioSuite plug-in
listed in the AudioSuite menu.
✦Selection Reference: This menu lets you choose which regions are
processed. By default, when you select a region in the track, the playlist,
or the Audio Regions list, all occurrences of the selected region are
processed. You can limit the processing to the track/playlist or the Audio
Regions list by selecting from the drop-down menu. Your choices are
• Playlist: If you choose Playlist, only regions that are selected in tracks
or playlists in the Edit window are processed.
• Region List: If you choose this option, only regions selected in the
Audio Regions list are processed.
✦Use in Playlist: This button lets you choose whether your chosen 
processing happens to all instances of your selected regions throughout

the session, or whether processing happens to only those you have
selected. The settings are as follows:
• Off: When this button is disabled, your processed audio is added to
the Audio Regions list but not put into the session.
• On: When this button is enabled, the processed audio is placed 
in the playlist according to the Selection reference you chose. (See
the Selection Reference bullet.) If you have Region List selected, all
copies of the region are replaced within the session. If you selected
Playlist, only the regions that you selected in the tracks are replaced.
✦File Mode Selector: From this menu, choose how your audio is
processed. You have three options:
• Overwrite Files: This option destructively overwrites your original
file. Not all plug-ins have this option.
• Create Individual Files: This option creates a new audio file for each
region processed. These regions appear in the Audio Regions list.
• Create Continuous File: Choosing this option processes the selected
region as a single audio file. This option isn’t available when you
have Region List chosen as you Selection reference. (See the earlier
Selection Reference bullet.)
✦Process Mode Selector: This menu appears if you have a selection that
includes more than one region. With it, you can select whether process-
ing is done region by region or whether it affects the entire selection.
✦Settings menu: This drop-down menu lets you save, copy, paste, import,
delete, and lock your plug-ins settings as well as set plug-in preferences
(such as where to store these settings). Figure 2-12 shows this menu.
✦Librarian menu: From this drop-down menu, choose from plug-in 
settings that you have stored.
✦Compare button: Click this button to compare the unprocessed sound
with the processed sound.
✦Preview button: Pressing this button lets you preview the audio before
you commit to processing it.
✦Bypass button: This button bypasses the effect, allowing you to quickly
and easily compare the affected and unaffected sounds. (This button
applies only to the Preview feature and doesn’t change the processing 
of the file.)
✦Process: Clicking this button processes the region(s) you selected
according to the rest of the settings in this window.

Using AudioSuite plug-ins to 
process an audio region
You can use the AudioSuite plug-ins to process any part — or all — of an
audio region. If you choose part of a region, that region is split so the
selected part becomes its own region.
To use an AudioSuite plug-in, follow these steps:
1. With the Selector tool, select the region or regions (click and drag
across them) in the Edit window you want to process.
Book IV, Chapter 2 details this process.
When you process audio by using the Reverb or Delay plug-ins, make
sure your selection includes extra room at the end of your material to
include the actual reverb and delay; otherwise, the sound will be cut off.
2. Choose the plug-in from the AudioSuite menu.
The Plug-In window appears.
3. Click Preview to hear your selected material.
4. Adjust the plug-in controls until you get the sound and processing 
settings you want.
The previous section spells out what these settings are for.
5. Click the Process button.
Pro Tools processes your audio.
Be aware that the processing can take some time and always demands some
computer resources.
Processing with External Effects
You can connect external effects devices (such as a reverb or compressor) to
Pro Tools and easily route your sends or inserts to them. The advantage of
using an external device (with its own dedicated source of processing power)
is that you can reduce demand for your system’s resources. The disadvan-
tage is that going out and back into Pro Tools takes at least some time; you
get a delay (latency) in the returned signal, especially if you’re using the
analog connection in your Digidesign interface. This latency isn’t much of a
problem with reverbs because a pre-delay on the effect is often desirable
anyway, but it can be a real issue if you use an analog compressor. (Chapter 5
in this mini-book talks about pre-delay on reverb.)

Processing with External Effects
561
The best way to eliminate the latency inherent in routing to an external
analog device is to record your effect to a new track and then shift over the
new region in that track so that it synchronizes with the source track for that
instrument. (Book IV, Chapter 3 explains the process of shifting regions.)
Using an external effects device requires three simple steps: creating a hard-
ware insert, connecting the device to your interface, and assigning the insert
in your track. How do you go about that? Glad you asked.
Creating a hardware insert
Before you can route your track’s insert to an external device, you need to
create a hardware insert — an insert in a track that routes your signal to one
of the hardware inputs and outputs of your Digidesign interface. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Setup➪I/O Setup from the main menu.
The I/O Setup dialog box appears.
2. Click the Insert tab on the I/O Setup dialog box.
3. Choose one of the insert paths listed (or choose Default if none are
listed); double-click that path to create a new name for it.
The insert becomes highlighted.
4. Type in a new name for the insert.
5. Select the proper format for the insert path (mono or stereo), and
then click OK.
Connecting your external device
You can connect an analog or a digital device as your hardware insert. The
following sections describe connecting both devices.
Connecting an analog device
Nothing much to connecting an analog device, really. Just do the following:
1. Select the output and input (or pairs for stereo) that correspond to the
inserts I show you how to create in the earlier section, “Creating a
hardware insert.”
2. Connect the output of your Digidesign interface to the input of your
external device.
3. Connect the output of your external device to the selected input in
your Digidesign interface.
Book VI
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your Mix

Processing with External Effects
562
Connecting a digital device
Whoa, here comes the high-tech stuff, right? Nah. Connecting a digital device
is a bit more involved, but it’s still not brain surgery:
1. Connect your external device to your Digidesign interface by the 
digital connections on the back of your device.
Depending on your device, you either use an optical connection or a
coaxial S/PDIF connection. (Book I, Chapter 2 has more about these
types of connections.) Connect the output of your Digidesign interface
to the input of your external device and the Output of your external
device to the input of your Digidesign interface.
2. Choose Setup➪Hardware from the main menu.
The Hardware Setup dialog box opens.
3. Click your Digidesign interface in the Peripheral section of the
window to select your Digidesign interface.
If you have only one Digidesign interface connected to your computer,
it’s automatically highlighted.
4. Perform one of the following in the Digital Input section of the
Hardware Setup dialog box:
• Connect through the optical ports. Choose S/PDIF from the Optical
Format drop-down menu.
• Connect through the coaxial (RCA) S/PDIF jack.
5. Choose your clock source — the digital clock that controls your
system — from the Clock Source drop-down menu.
• External: If you want the effect device to be your clock source
• Internal: If you want Pro Tools to be the clock source (or if you don’t
know what a clock source is)
Check out the Pro Tools Reference manual or go to Book II, Chapter 2 for
more on clock sources.
6. Set your external device to the appropriate clock source: Internal if
you select External in Pro Tools, and External if you select Internal 
in Pro Tools.
Your owner’s manual should describe this process.
7. Click OK.

Processing with External Effects
563
Routing your track
To route your track’s insert to the hardware insert connected to your 
effects device, choose the hardware insert from the Insert drop-down menu,
accessed by clicking and holding over one of the arrows in the Insert section
of your track’s channel strip.
You’re now ready to dig in and use your external effect processor on your
Pro Tools tracks.
The only disadvantage with using external effects in Pro Tools is that you
can’t save the effect settings with your Pro tools session like you can with 
an RTAS plug-in. In order to get around this deficit, I usually type the effect
patch (setting number) I use for a track in the Comments section of the track.
To enter this information, double-click the track’s name in the Edit or the
Mix window to call up the Name Track dialog box. Enter your effect patch
and any other reminders you need in the Comments section, and then click
OK to save your comments and close the window.

E
qualization (EQ) comprises changing the frequency response of the 
data in the session’s track to make the track sound how you want. The
main goal when EQing during mixing is to get the instruments in your song
to blend together smoothly (Book VI, Chapters 1 and 2 explore the process
of mixing your tracks).
In this chapter, you discover the types of equalizers used in Pro Tools, and 
I walk you through applying EQ to your tracks. This chapter also offers
some basic EQ settings for a variety of instruments to get you started EQing
your songs.
Exploring Equalization
The most useful tool you have for mixing is equalization. You use equalizers
to adjust the various frequencies of your instruments so that there’s enough
room for each of them in your stereo tracks. Pro Tools offers three types of
equalizers — parametric, low-shelf/high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass. I 
outline these types of EQ in the following sections.
Parametric
Using the parametric equalizer allows you to choose the frequency that you
want to change as well as the range of frequencies around that frequency.
With a parametric EQ, you dial-in the frequency that you want to change and
then set the range itself (referred to as the Q) that you want to affect. This
type is EQ is called a peak, or notch, EQ in Pro Tools; it’s designated by the
icon shown here in the margin.

Exploring Equalization
566
Q is a number that signifies the range of frequencies that the EQ affects —
usually between one-half and two octaves. Pro Tools offers settings from 
.33 to 12, with the lower numbers allowing larger ranges of frequencies 
to be EQed.
You choose your Q setting based on what you hear in the mix. Just like how
you can experiment with different frequencies to adjust in the mix, you can
also try different Q settings to find the best possible frequency range to use.
The beauty of using a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band
(range) of frequencies and then boost (increase) or cut (decrease) them. This
capability enables you to get the various instruments in a mix to fit with 
one another. (This technique is carving out frequencies.) When you’re mixing,
the parametric EQ is the most useful equalizer because you can adjust the
frequency response of each instrument so that the other instruments can be
heard clearly in the mix. The only downside to using parametric EQs is that
they need processing power to run. If you have a lot of EQing to do, you
might end up stressing your system pretty hard. (Yet another reason to have
a powerful computer.)
Low-shelf/high-shelf
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above (high-shelf) or below
(low-shelf) the target frequency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the
top or bottom end of the frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a
low-shelf EQ to roll off the frequencies below 250 hertz (Hz), which reduces
the amount of rumble (low-frequency noise) in a recording. You generally
use the shelf EQ to adjust the lowest and highest frequencies and the para-
metric EQ to adjust any in-between frequencies when you mix.
In Pro Tools, the low- and high-shelf EQs are designated with the icons seen
here in the margin. The low-shelf is the left-facing fork, (top) and the high-
shelf is the right-facing art in the margin (bottom).
Low-pass/high-pass
Believe it or not, sometimes your track just sounds better if you eliminate 
a few carefully chosen frequencies. You just need to know which ones to
target. That’s where a couple of Pro Tools capabilities can help with the
needed audio acrobatics: low-pass (ducking the high frequencies you don’t
want) and high-pass (jumping over the low frequencies you don’t want).
This type of EQ is actually called a filter because, um, it filters out frequen-
cies either higher (low-pass) or lower (high-pass) than the target frequency.
A low-pass filter is used for eliminating unwanted high frequencies, and a
high-pass filter is useful for getting rid of unwanted low frequencies. In Pro

Dialing In EQ
567
Tools, the low- and high-pass filters are designated with the icons seen here
in the margin. The low-pass filter is the downward slope (top) and the 
high-pass filter is the upward slope (bottom) art in the margin.
Dialing In EQ
Before you start EQing your tracks, you need to know how to insert the EQ
plug-in in a track and how to actually make those adjustments with one of
the EQ plug-ins in Pro Tools. The following sections detail these procedures.
Inserting an EQ plug-in in a track
To EQ a track, you first need to insert the Pro Tools AudioSuite plug-in in the
track. To do so, the follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Mix Window➪Inserts from the main menu to make sure
that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channels strip.
The Inserts drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. To fit the type of track you have, select the Multi-Channel Plug-In or
the Multi-Mono Plug-In option.
If your track is stereo, use Multi-Channel; if it’s mono, use Multi-Mono.
4. Select the 1-Band EQ3, 4-Band EQ-3, or 7-Band EQ 3 option.
Your chosen EQ plug-in window opens. (The 1-Band EQ 3 option lets you
set one EQ parameter, whereas the 4-Band EQ 3 option lets you work
with four parameters. I bet you can guess how many parameters you
work with in 7-Band EQ-3.) For more on which option would work best
for you, check out the following section.
5. Adjust the parameters that you want to EQ.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric, low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.
Figure 3-1:

Dialing In EQ
568
If you want to EQ a bunch of tracks at the same time and use the same 
settings (submixes, for example), you can do this the following way:
1. Select one of the buses from the Output selector in each track that you
want to submix.
2. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks that you want
(choose 1), the type (choose Auxiliary Input), and whether you want
your track in stereo or mono.
4. Use your new track’s Input selector to select the bus that you used for
the output of the submix tracks as the input for this auxiliary track.
5. Insert one of the EQ plug-ins from the Insert drop-down menu in this
auxiliary track.
The EQ plug-in window opens.
6. Adjust the EQ settings to get the sound that you want.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.
Perusing Pro Tools EQ options
Using an EQ in Pro Tools comprises selecting one of the plug-ins, inserting it
in the track that you want to affect, and setting your parameters. Pro Tools
comes with three basic EQs: 1-band EQ, 4-band EQ, and 7-band EQ. They’re
part of the Real Time AudioSuite set of tools — RTAS — which is the plug-in
format that Pro Tools uses.
You can also use any RTAS-type EQ plug-in, but these have to be purchased
separately. If you do an Internet search with the keywords RTAS plug-ins,
you’re sure to find tons to choose from. The 1-band EQ plug-in for Pro Tools,
as shown in Figure 3-2, lets you apply one EQ filter to a track. This EQ is
useful if you just want to adjust one parameter. You can choose any of the
types of EQs — parametric, low-shelf/high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass —
by clicking the appropriate button to engage your chosen EQ.
4-band and 7-band EQs
The 4-band and 7-band EQs in Pro Tools, as shown in Figure 3-3, let you
adjust up to four or seven (respectively) EQ filters to a track. This type of EQ
is useful when you have to do some major EQing to a track. Both EQs share
the same window. The difference is that with the 4-band EQ, you can select
only up to four of the seven possible bands of EQ. Comparatively, the 7-band
EQ lets you use them all.

Dialing In EQ
569
Figure 3-3 shows all seven bands. These are
✦HPF (High-Pass Filter): Located to the left of the graphical display 
for the EQ, here you can choose the high-pass filter or the notch EQ 
setting.
✦LPF (Low-Pass Filter): Located just to the left of the graphical display 
for the EQ, here you can choose the low-pass filter or the notch EQ 
setting.
✦LF (Low Frequency): You can select between a peak or low-shelf EQ by
clicking the appropriate icon next to the LF name.
✦LMF (Lower-Middle Frequency): Your only option is a peak EQ.
✦MF (Middle Frequency): Again, your only option is a peak EQ.
✦HMF (High-Middle Frequency): Here, you can adjust a peak EQ.
✦HF (High Frequency): Like the LF option, this EQ can be a peak or shelf
(this time a high-shield) EQ.
When you engage each band of EQ (by clicking the In button below the 
Q knob), a dot shows up in the graphical section of the EQ window to show
you how your EQ is affecting the track the EQ is assigned to. These dots 
are color-coded to make it easy for you to see which band is where in 
the graph.

Using parametric (peak and notch) EQ
To use the parametric EQ, click the Peak EQ button in whatever EQ plug-in
window — 1-band or 4-band, for example — you have open. You have three
settings to adjust:
✦Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. You adjust this 
setting either by moving the knob or by clicking in the box and typing 
a value between .1 and 10.
✦Freq: This is the frequency that the EQ centers around. You select the
range of frequencies above and below this point by using the Q setting
(see the following bullet). You can type in the frequency on the box or
use the knob to make your adjustment.
✦Gain: This is the amount of boost (increase) or cut (decrease) that you
apply to the signal. You can either type in the amount in the box next to
the Peak EQ button or use the knob to the right.
Using low-shelf/high-shelf EQ
To use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, click the Low Shelf and High Shelf buttons in
the EQ band you want to engage. When you use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, you
have three parameters to adjust:
✦Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. You adjust this 
setting either by moving the knob or by clicking in the box and typing 
a value between .1 and 2.
✦Freq: This is the frequency that the shelf starts at. You can type in the
frequency in the box or use the knob to make your adjustment.

571
✦Gain: This is the amount of boost or cut that you apply to the signal.
You can either type in the amount in the box next to the shelf button or
use the knob to the right.
Using low-pass/high-pass EQ
Here’s where you tell Pro Tools which frequencies to avoid in the course of
adjusting the EQ. The low- and high-pass buttons appear next to the name of
the EQ band. You have two parameters to adjust:
✦Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. With these 
filters, you can select between 6, 12, 18, and 24 decibels (dB) per octave.
The higher the number, the more severe the filter.
✦Freq: This is the frequency that the filter starts at. You can type in the
frequency in the box or use the knob to make your adjustment.
With all the EQ types, you can click and drag the color-coded dot in the
graphical display section to set your EQ bands. Dragging left or right changes
the frequency that the EQ is set at; by dragging up and down, you can change
the gain.
Equalizing Your Tracks
Only so many frequencies are available for all the instruments in a mix. If
more than one instrument occupies a particular frequency range, they can
get in each other’s way and muddy the mix. Your goals when EQing during
the mixing process are to reduce the frequencies that add clutter and/or to
enhance the frequencies that define an instrument’s sound. To do this, make
a little space for each instrument within the same general frequency range,
which you can accomplish by EQing the individual tracks as you mix. The
first part of this chapter shows you how to get up to the point of doing some
EQing. The rest of the chapter gets your hands dirty with some real EQing
experience.
Here’s a good trick to use when initially trying to decide which frequencies
to boost or cut: First, solo the track(s) that you’re working on and set your
parametric EQ to a narrow Q setting (a high number). Next, turn the boost
all the way up (move the Gain slider all the way to the right) and sweep the
frequency setting as you listen (to sweep, just move the Freq slider to the
left and right). Noticing the areas where the annoying or pleasing sounds 
are located can help you better understand the frequencies that your instru-
ment produces. When you find a frequency to adjust, experiment with the 
Q setting to find the range that produces the best sound, and then adjust the
amount of boost or cut until it has the effect that you want.

Equalizing Your Tracks

After you determine the frequencies that you want to work with, do your
EQing to the individual track while the instrument is in the mix (not soloed).
You want to make the instrument fit as well as possible with the rest of the
instruments, and to do this you need to know how your instrument sounds
in relation to all the music going on around it.
Your goal when making adjustments in EQ is to make all the tracks blend
together as well as possible. In some instances, you may have to make some
radical EQ moves. Don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to make your mix
sound good — even if it means having cuts or boosts as great as 12dB.
General EQ guidelines
Although some instruments do call for specific EQ guidelines, you need to
think about some general considerations when EQing, regardless of the
instrument involved. When it comes to the audible frequency spectrum
(about 20 Hz to 20 kHz), certain frequencies have special characteristics:
✦Frequencies lower than 100 Hz can either warm up an instrument or can
add boominess to it.
✦Frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz can be muddy for some instruments
and can add fullness to others.
✦Frequencies around 400 Hz can sound boxy.
✦Frequencies around 800 Hz can add depth or body.
✦1 kHz–2 kHz frequencies can add attack (initial signal) or punch (pro-
nounced attack) to some instruments and can create a nasally sound 
in others.
✦2 kHz–5 kHz can increase the presence of instruments.
✦5 kHz–8 kHz frequencies can sound harsh on some instruments.
✦Frequencies from 8 kHz–17 kHz add airiness or brightness to an 
instrument.
To adjust frequencies via Pro Tool EQ plug-ins, use the Frequency knob to
choose the frequency you want to EQ and the Gain knob to control the
amount of EQ that you boost (move the knob to the right) or cut (move the
knob to the left) from your track.
You’re generally better off cutting a frequency than boosting one. This 
belief goes back to the days of analog EQs, which often added noise when
boosting a signal. This can still be a factor with some digital EQs, but the
issue is much less. Out of habit, I still try to cut frequencies before I boost
them, and I recommend that you do the same (not out of habit, of course,
but because if a noise difference exists between cutting and boosting, you
might as well avoid it).

Equalizing Your Tracks
573
The exact frequencies that you end up cutting or boosting depend on three
factors: the sound you’re after, the tonal characteristic of the instrument,
and the relationship between all the instruments in the song. In the following
sections, I list a variety of frequencies to cut or boost for each instrument. If
you don’t want to follow all the suggestions, choose only the ones that fit
with your goals.
The parametric EQ is the type of EQ you use most when trying to get your
tracks to fit together. This EQ gives you the greatest control over the range
of frequencies you can adjust. The other EQ types (high-shelf, low-shelf,
high-pass, low-pass) can often be used successfully for the top or bottom 
frequencies listed in the sections that follow.
Equalizing vocals
For the majority of popular music, the vocals are the most important instru-
ment in the song. You need to hear them clearly, and they should contain the
character of the singer’s voice and style. One of the most common mistakes
in mixing vocals is to make them too loud. The next most common mistake is
to make them too quiet. (The second mistake most often occurs when a shy
or self-conscious vocalist is doing the mixing.) You want the lead vocals to
shine through, but you don’t want them to overpower the other instruments.
The best way to do this is to EQ the vocal tracks so they can sit nicely in the
mix and still be heard clearly. The following guidelines can help you do this.
Lead
The lead vocal can go a lot of ways, depending on the singer and the style 
of music. For the most part, I tend to cut a little around 200 Hz and add a
couple dBs at 3 kHz and again at 10 kHz. In general, follow these guidelines:
✦To add fullness, add a few dBs at 150 Hz.
✦To get rid of muddiness, cut a few dBs at 200–250 Hz.
✦To add clarity, boost a little at 3 kHz.
✦For more presence, add at 5 kHz.
✦To add air or to brighten, boost at 10 kHz.
✦To get rid of sibilance, cut a little between 7.5 and 10 kHz.
Backup
To keep backup vocals from competing with lead vocals, cut the backup
vocals a little in the low end (below 250 Hz) and at the 2.5–3.5 kHz range. To
add clarity, boost a little around 10 kHz without letting it get in the way of
the lead vocal.

Equalizing guitar
For the most part, you want to avoid getting a muddy guitar sound and make
sure that the guitar attack comes through in the mix.
Electric
Electric guitars often need a little cutting below 100 Hz to get rid of muddi-
ness. A boost between 120 and 250 Hz adds warmth. A boost in the 2.5–4 kHz
range brings out the attack of the guitar, and a boost at 5 kHz can add some
bite.
Acoustic
Acoustic guitars often do well with a little cut below 80 Hz and again around
800 Hz–1 kHz. If you want a warmer tone and more body, try boosting a little
around 150–250 Hz. Also, try adding a few dBs around 3–5 kHz if you want
more attack or punch. A few dBs added at 7 kHz can add a little more bright-
ness to the instrument.
Equalizing bass
Bass instruments can get muddy pretty fast. The mud generally happens in
the 200–300 Hz range, so I either leave that alone or cut just a little if the
bass lacks definition. I rarely add any frequencies below 100 Hz. If the instru-
ment sounds flat or thin, I boost some between 100–200 Hz. Adding a little
between 500 Hz–1 kHz can increase the punch, and a boost between 2.5–5
kHz accentuates the attack, adding a little brightness to the bass.
One of the most important things to keep in mind with a bass guitar is to
make sure that it and a kick drum can both be heard. You need to adjust the
frequencies of these two instruments to make room for both. If you add a 
frequency to a kick drum, try cutting the same frequency from the bass.
Equalizing drums
The guidelines for EQing drums depend on whether you use live acoustic
drums or a drum machine. (A drum machine probably requires less EQ
because the sounds were already EQed when they were created.) The type
and placement of your mic or mics also affect how you EQ the drums. 
(You can find out more about mic placement in Book III, Chapter 2.)
Kick
You want a kick drum to blend with the bass guitar. To do this, reduce the
frequencies that a bass guitar takes up. For example, if I boost a few dB

Equalizing Your Tracks
575
between 100 and 200 Hz for a bass guitar, I generally cut them in the kick
drum (and maybe go as high as 250 Hz). To bring out the bottom end of a
kick drum, I sometimes add a couple of dBs between 80 and 100 Hz. A kick
drum can get boxy sounding (you know, like a cardboard box), so I often cut
a little between 400 and 600 Hz to get rid of the boxiness. To bring out the
click from the beater hitting the head, try adding a little between 2.5 and 5
kHz. This increases the attack of the drum and gives it more presence.
Snare
A snare drum drives the music, making it the most important drum in popu-
lar music. As such, it needs to really cut through the rest of the instruments.
Although the adjustments that you make depend on the pitch and size of the
drum and whether you use one mic or two during recording, you can usually
boost a little at 100–150 Hz for added warmth. You can also try boosting at
250 Hz to add some depth. If the drum sounds too boxy, try cutting at 800
Hz–1 kHz. A little boost at around 3–5 kHz increases the attack, and an
increase in the 8–10 kHz range can add crispness to the drum.
If you use two mics during recording, you might consider dropping a few dBs
on the top mic in both the 800 Hz–1 kHz range and the 8–10 kHz range. Allow
the bottom mic to create the crispness. I generally use a shelf EQ to roll off
the bottom end of the bottom mic below, say, 250–300 Hz. Depending on the
music (R&B and pop, for instance), I might use a shelf EQ to add a little
sizzle to the bottom mic by boosting frequencies higher than 10 kHz.
For many recording engineers and producers, their snare drum sound is
almost a signature. If you listen to different artists’ songs from the same pro-
ducer, you’ll likely hear similarities in the snare drum. Don’t be afraid to take
your time getting the snare drum to sound just right. After all, if you become
a famous producer, you’ll want people to recognize your distinct sound. And
you want it to sound good anyway.
Tom-toms
Tom-toms come in a large range of sizes and pitches. For mounted toms, you
can boost a little around 200–250 Hz to add depth to the drum. A boost in
the 3–5 kHz range can add more of the sticks’ attack. For some additional
presence, try adding a little in the 5–8 kHz range. If the drums sound too
boxy, try cutting a little in the 600 Hz–1 kHz range.
For floor toms, you can try boosting the frequency range of 40–125 Hz if you
want to add some richness and fullness. You might also find that cutting in
the 400–800 Hz range can get rid of any boxy sound that the drum may have.
To add more attack, boost the 2.5–5 kHz range.

576
Hi-hats
Most of the time, hi-hats are pretty well represented in the rest of the mics 
in the drum set. Depending on which mics are picking up the hi-hats, though,
you can use a hi-hat mic to bring out their sheen or brightness. To do this,
try boosting the frequencies higher than 10 kHz with a shelf EQ. You might
also find that cutting frequencies lower than 200 Hz eliminates any rumble
created by other drums that a hi-hat mic picks up.
Cymbals
With cymbals, I usually cut anything below 150–200 Hz with a shelf EQ to get
rid of any rumbling that these mics pick up. I also drop a few dBs at 1–2 kHz
if the cymbals sound kind of trashy or clanky. Adding a shelf EQ higher than
10 kHz can add a nice sheen to the mix.
Overhead mics
If you use overhead mics to pick up both the drums and the cymbals, be
careful about cutting too much low end because doing so just sucks the life
right out of your drums. Also, if the drums coming through the overhead
mics sound boxy or muddy, work with the 100–200 Hz frequencies for the
muddiness and 400 Hz–1 kHz frequencies for the boxiness.
Equalizing percussion
High-pitched percussion instruments (shakers, for example) sound good
when the higher frequencies are boosted a little bit — say, higher than 10
kHz. This adds some brightness and softness to their sound. You can also
roll off many of the lower frequencies, lower than 500 Hz, to eliminate any
boxiness that might be present from miking too closely. (See Book III,
Chapter 2 for more on mic placement.)
Lower-pitched percussion instruments, such as maracas, can also have the
lower frequencies cut a little: Use 250 Hz and lower. Try boosting frequencies
between 2.5 and 5 kHz to add more of the instruments’ attack. To brighten
them up, add a little bit in the 8–10 kHz range.
Equalizing piano
For pianos, you often want to make sure that the instrument has both a nice
attack and a warm-bodied tone. You can add attack in the 2.5–5 kHz range,
and warmth can be added in the 80–150 Hz range. If your piano sounds
boomy or muddy, try cutting a little between 200 and 400 Hz.

D
ynamics processors allow you to control the dynamic range of a 
signal. Dynamic range, listed in decibels (dB), is the difference between
the softest and loudest signals that a sound source produces. The larger 
the dynamic range, the more variation exists between the softest and 
loudest notes.
The four types of dynamics processors are compressors, limiters, gates, and
expanders. This chapter gives you the lowdown on each type and how they
can help you add punch to or smooth out an instrument’s sound, even out
an erratic performance, or eliminate noise from a track.
Connecting Dynamics Processors
Dynamics processors are Insert effects: When you insert them into a 
track, they become part of it, affecting the track’s entire signal. To apply a
dynamics processor in Pro Tools, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Mix Window➪Inserts from the main menu.
This makes sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip.
The Inserts drop-down menu opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Introducing Compressors
578
3. Select either the Multi-Channel plug-in or the Multi-Mono plug-in
option, depending on whether your track is a stereo (use multichannel)
or a mono (use multimono) track.
4. Choose Bombfactory BF76, Compressor/Limiter Dyn 3, or Expander/
Gate Dyn 3 option from the Dynamics menu.
(I cover the four options in the sections that follow.) The chosen plug-in
window opens.
Introducing Compressors
A compressor, um, compresses (narrows) the dynamic range of the sound
being affected. The compressor not only limits how loud a note can be but
also reduces the difference between the loudest and softest note, thus
reducing the dynamic range.
Compressors are used for three main purposes (although other purposes
certainly exist as well):
✦Keeping transients — the initial attack of an instrument — from 
creating digital distortion during tracking
This is common with drums that have a very fast attack (initial signal)
that can easily overload the recorder (or converters or preamps).
✦Evening any performance that shows signs of a high degree of
unwanted dynamic variation
You do this during either the mixing or tracking stage. Some recorded
passages are too loud, and others are too quiet.
✦Raising the overall apparent level of the music during mastering
For example, listen to a CD recorded before 1995 and then one from the
last year or so. The newer CD sounds louder.

I cover the first purpose (the first bullet in the preceding list) in Book III,
Chapter 2. Likewise, I explore the third purpose in Book VII, Chapter 2. So
that leaves the second purpose to explore with sample settings later in this
chapter.
Getting to know compressor parameters
Pro Tools comes with its own compressor plug-in, as I detail in the previous
section. The compressor shown is Figure 4-2 is the Compressor/Limiter Dyn
3 plug-in. After you get this guy open, adjust the following parameters:
✦Knee: Use the Knee knob to control how the compressor behaves while
the input signal passes the threshold. The lower the setting, the more
gradual the compressor acts while the signal passes the threshold.
✦Attack: Use the Attack knob to control how soon the compressor kicks
in. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms); the lower the number, the
faster the attack.
✦Gain: Use the Gain knob to adjust the level (volume) of the signal going
out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels (dB). Because adding
compression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use
this control to raise the level back up to where it was when it went in.
✦Ratio: Watch the Ratio setting to see how much the compressor affects
the signal. The ratio 2:1, for instance, means that for every decibel the
signal goes above the threshold setting, it is reduced by two. In other
words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its output from
the compressor will be only 0.5dB louder. With ratios above 10:1, your
compressor starts to act like a limiter. (See the later section, “Looking
into Limiters.”)

✦Release: Use the Release knob to control how long the compressor 
continues affecting the signal after it drops back below the Threshold
setting. Like the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds (ms). The
lower the number, the faster the release time.
✦Thresh: The Threshold setting dictates the decibel level at which 
the compressor starts to act on the signal. This setting is often listed as
dB below peak (0 dB). In other words, a setting of –6 dB means that the
compressor starts to act when the signal is 6 dB below its calibrated 0
dB mark. In digital systems, 0 dB is the highest level that a signal can go
before clipping (distorts due to going over the maximum level possible).
✦Levels: The levels section of the Compressor/Limiter processor has four
basic functions:
• Phase Invert: This button, located to the right of the Levels title,
inverts the phase (reverses the sound wave) of your signal. Click this
button to engage and disengage it. It illuminates blue when it’s
engaged.
• Input: This meter shows the level of your signal entering the effect.
• Output: This meter shows the level leaving your effect.
• GR: GR stands for Gain Reduction. This meter shows you the
amount, in decibels, that your input level is attenuated.
Also note the Side-Chain adjustments next to the graphical section of the
compressor/limiter window. I cover this in detail later in this chapter in 
the “Setting Up Side Chains” section.
Getting started using compression
A compressor is one of the most useful — and one of the most abused —
pieces of gear in the recording studio. The most difficult part of using com-
pression is that every instrument reacts differently to the same settings. In
this section, I offer you some guidelines and ideas for using the compressor
effectively.
The following steps show you one good way to get familiar with the com-
pressor. First start by playing your track (hit the Spacebar or play button in
the Transport window) and then follow these steps:
1. Start with a high Ratio setting (between 8:1 and 10:1) and turn the
Threshold knob all the way to the right.
2. Slowly turn the Threshold knob back to the left, watch the meters,
and listen carefully.

Introducing Compressors
581
While you reduce the threshold, notice where the meters are when 
you start hearing a change in the sound of the track. Also notice what
happens to the sound when you have the threshold really low and the
meters are peaked. (The sound is very different from where you
started.)
3. Slowly turn the Threshold knob back to the right and notice how the
sound changes back again.
After you get used to how the sound changes from adjusting the Threshold
setting, try using different Attack and Release settings and do this procedure
again. The more you experiment and critically listen to the changes made by
the different compressor settings, the better you’ll understand how to get
the sound that you want. The following guidelines can also help you achieve
your desired sound:
✦Try to avoid using any compression on a stereo mix while you mix
your music. Compression is a job for the mastering phase of your 
project. If you compress your stereo tracks during mixdown, you limit
what can be done to your music in the mastering stage. This is true 
even if you master it yourself and think you know what you want during
mixdown.
✦If you hear noise when you use your compressor, you set it too high.
In effect, you’re compressing the loud portions enough to make the level
of the softest sections of the music (including any noise) much louder in
comparison. To get rid of the noise, decrease the Ratio or the Threshold
settings.
✦To increase the punch of a track, make sure that the Attack setting
isn’t too quick. Otherwise, you lose the initial transient and the punch
of a track.
✦To smooth out a track, use a short Attack setting and a quick Release
time. This evens out the difference in level between the initial transient
and the main body of the sound, and results in a smoother sound.
Less is more when using compression. Resist the temptation to turn those
knobs too much to the right, which will just squash your music. On the other
hand, if that’s the effect you’re going for, don’t be afraid to experiment.
Using compression
When you first start experimenting with compressor settings, you most likely
won’t know where to start. To make this process easier for you, here I include
some sample settings for a variety of instruments. Start with these and use
the guidelines listed in the preceding section to fine-tune your settings.

Compressing vocals
Most recording engineers think that compression is a must for vocals to
even out the often-erratic levels that a singer can produce and to tame tran-
sient jumps in level that can cause digital distortion. You can indeed use
compression on vocals to even out the performance and to create an effect.
If you use a compressor to even out a vocal performance, you don’t want to
hear the compressor working (this can manifest as distortion or a pumping
sound). Instead, you want to catch only the occasional extremely loud 
transient that would cause clipping.
A good compression setting has three elements:
✦A fast attack to catch the stray transient
✦A quick release so that the compression doesn’t color the sound of the
singer
✦A low ratio so that when the compressor does go on, it smoothes the
vocals without squashing them
A typical setting might look like this:
Threshold: –8 dB
Ratio: Between 1.5:1 and 2:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
If you want to use a compressor that pumps and breathes — that is, one that
you can really hear working — or if you want to bring the vocals way up
front in the mix, try using the following setting. This puts the vocals “in your
face,” as recording engineers say:
Threshold: –2 dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need
to add a fair amount of gain at this setting.

Introducing Compressors
583
As you can see, the two parameters that you adjust most are Threshold and
Ratio. Experiment with these settings and check their effects by toggling
between the affected and unaffected sound. (Use the Bypass button in the
plug-in window.) Watch the levels going to disk and make sure that they don’t
peak over –6 dB or –4 dB. This ensures a hot signal — one that is loud — and
also leaves you some headroom (a few decibels below clipping) for when you
mixdown. (Find more on this in Chapter 7 in this mini-book.)
Compressing electric guitars
Generally (these days, at least), the signal from an electric guitar gets run
through a compressor and other external effects before it’s even recorded.
You don’t need additional compression when you track the guitar unless you
use a clean (undistorted) setting on your guitar. If you do want to use a little
compression to bring the guitar forward and give it some punch, try these
settings:
Threshold: –1 dB
Ratio: Between 2:1 and 3:1
Attack: 25 ms to 30 ms
Release: About 200 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
The slow attack is what allows the guitar to have a bit of punch to it. If you
want less punchiness, shorten the attack slightly. Be careful though because
if you shorten it too much, you end up with a mushy sound. (Ahem . . . we’re
not talking romance here. I mean the guitar has no definition.)
Compressing electric basses
Another way to get a handle on the potential muddiness of the amplified
bass guitar is to use a little compression. Compression can also help control
any uneven levels that result from overzealous or inexperienced bass 
players. Try these settings for a start:
Threshold: –4 dB
Ratio: Between 2.5:1 and 3:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.

Introducing Compressors
584
Compressing acoustic instruments
You don’t generally need a lot of compression on acoustic instruments, 
especially if you want a natural sound. You can use the compressor to even
out the resonance of the instrument, which keeps the main character of the
instrument from getting lost in a mix and also avoids a muddy sound. Here’s
a good setting for strummed or picked acoustic instruments:
Threshold: –6 dB
Ratio: Between 3:1 and 4:1
Attack: About 150 ms
Release: About 400 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
Release is set very high because of the amount of sustain that these acoustic
instruments can have. If you play an instrument with less sustain, such as a
banjo, you may find that a shorter attack and release work just fine. In this
case, you can try the following settings:
Threshold: –6 dB
Ratio: Between 2.5:1 and 3:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain, if any.
Compressing kick drums
A kick drum responds quite well to a compressor when tracking. For the
most part, you can get by with settings that tame the boom a little and allow
the initial attack to get through. A sample setting looks like this:
Threshold: –6 dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: Between 200 ms and 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.

Looking into Limiters
585
Compressing snare drums
Adding compression to the snare drum is crucial if you want a tight, punchy
sound. You can go a lot of ways with the snare. The following settings are
common and versatile:
Threshold: –4 dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 5 ms and 10 ms
Release: Between 125 ms and 175 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
Compressing percussion
Because percussion instruments have high sound levels and are prone to
extreme transients, I like to use a little compression just to control the levels
going to disk. Here’s a good starting point:
Threshold: –10 dB
Ratio: Between 3:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 10 ms and 20 ms
Release: About 50 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need
to add a bit of gain.
Looking into Limiters
A limiter is basically a compressor on steroids. Rather than simply reducing
a signal that crosses over the threshold setting, limiters put a ceiling on the
highest level of a sound source. Any signal above the threshold is chopped
off rather than just compressed. Using a limiter is great for raising the 
overall level of an instrument as well as for keeping transients from eating 
up all the headroom (maximum level) of a track.
Using the compressor/limiter in Pro Tools gives you more control than using
a basic limiter in that you can adjust the ratio to be a little more subtle than
just chopping off a signal.

Looking into Limiters

Understanding limiter settings
Pro Tools comes with the Compressor/Limiter plug-in (that I cover earlier in
this chapter) as well as the Bombfactory BF76 peak limiter, as shown in
Figure 4-3. (You might have more plug-ins available if you own one of the
bundle packs available from Digidesign.) You insert this plug-in into a track
by following the procedures listed in the “Connecting Dynamics Processors”
section at the beginning of this chapter.
The Bombfactory limiter contains the following parameters:
✦Input: Use the Input dial to control the threshold level (when the limiter
kicks in) as well as how much reduction the limiter applies to your
signal. If you have the Gain Reduction (GR) option selected for the meter
display (see its upcoming bullet), you can see how the dial relates to
your gain reduction and make adjustments accordingly.
✦Output: This is the same as Gain in most compressors. Use this dial to
adjust the level (volume) of the signal going out of the compressor. You
use this dial to raise the level back to where it was when it went in.
✦Attack: Use the Attack dial to control how soon the limiter kicks in. With
the Bombfactory peak limiter, the dial doesn’t list your setting in mil-
liseconds. This goes back to the inspiration for this plug in (the classic
1176 compressor made in the 1970s), but the real-world numbers for this
dial are from 0.4 ms to 5.7 ms, with the shorter attack when the dial is to
the left, and the longer attack times as you turn the dial to the right.
✦Release: Use the Release knob to control how long the limiter continues
limiting the signal after it drops back below the threshold setting. Like
with Attack, the Bombfactory BF76 uses arbitrary numbers on its
Figure 4-3:

Release dial. The real numbers for this setting range from 0.06 ms to 1.1
seconds. Faster release times are achieved when the dial is to the left;
conversely, turning the dial to the right lengthens the release time.
✦Ratio: Use the Ratio setting to show how much the compressor affects
the signal. The ratio — 2:1, for instance — means that for every decibel
the signal goes above the threshold setting, it is reduced by two. In
other words, if a signal goes 1 dB higher than the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor will be only 0.5 dB louder.
✦Meter: You have the option to select how you want the meter to work.
The Bombfactory peak limiter offers you four options (which you
choose by clicking the appropriate button):
• GR (Gain Reduction): In this case, the meter shows you how many
decibels your signal is being reduced when the limiter kicks in. This
is the meter setting used most often.
• –18: This option shows you the level of your output signal, calibrated
such that when the needle hits 0VU (Volume Units) your level is at
–18 dB full-scale. Both this and the following option (–24) are used by
people who want a certain amount of headroom (additional signal
level higher than 0) on their meters) or have other equipment that
relies on either the –18 or –24 standard. The one you choose
depends on how much headroom you want.
• –24: This option shows you the level of your output signal, calibrated
such that when the needle hits 0VU Volume Units) your level is actu-
ally at –24 dB full-scale.
• Off: This turns off the meter. This is a good option if you find yourself
relying too much on “seeing” what your limiter is doing and too little
on actually listening to your music as you make your adjustments.
Setting limits with the BF76 limiter
The Bombfactory BF76 peak limiter is essentially a compressor on steroids
that’s designed to impart a certain sound to your music. Using the default
settings as a starting point gives you an idea of what this sound is supposed
to be. Selecting an 8:1 ratio offer a good quick mix compression to give your
songs a bit of life. Shortening the attack and/or release times adds more 
distortion to your signal. I caution from using too much of this limiter. When
used judiciously, though, the BF76 can spice up your tracks a bit.
The BF76 plug-in is not the only limiter you might want to use on your music.
Too, some of the reasons for using it are different than for other limiters.
When using any limiter, keep in mind these two tips to achieve the best
results:

Introducing Gates and Expanders
588
✦When using limiters to raise the volume of a track or mix, limit only 2
dB or 3 dB at a time. This way, the limiter doesn’t alter the sound of
your signal but just reduces the highest peaks and raises the volume.
✦To add grunge (distortion) to a track, lower the Threshold setting so
that you limit the signal 6 to 12 dB. Tweak the Attack and Release
parameters to get the sound you’re after. This creates distortion that
might work for a particular track, such as a snare drum.
Introducing Gates and Expanders
A gate is basically the opposite of a limiter: Rather than limiting how loud 
a note can get, a gate limits how soft a note can get. A gate filters out any
sound below the threshold and allows any note above it to be passed
through unaffected.
An expander is to a gate what a compressor is to a limiter. Instead of reduc-
ing the volume of notes below the set threshold by a specified amount, an
expander reduces them by a ratio. In other words, with a gate, you set a 
certain decibel amount by which a signal is reduced. With an expander, you
reduce the signal by setting a ratio. The ratio changes the signal gradually,
making the affected signals sound more natural.
Use an expander when you want to subtly reduce noise from a track rather
than just filtering it out completely. A classic example is when you deal with
breath from a singer. If you use a gate, you get an unnatural-sounding track
because the breaths are filtered out completely. With the expander, you can
set it to reduce the breath just enough so that it’s less noticeable, but you
can leave a little of the sound in to make the singer sound normal. (I mean,
everyone has to breathe, right?)
Gates, on the other hand, are useful for completely filtering any unwanted
noise in a recording environment. A classic situation for using gates is when
you record drums. You can set the gate to filter any sound (other drums, for
instance) except for the sounds resulting from the hits to the particular
drum that you miked.
Getting to know gate parameters
You can see the expander/gate plug-in that ships with Pro Tools in Figure 4-4.
The various settings that you get to play with are similar to the ones for
compressors and limiters, as the following list makes clear:
✦Range: The Range setting is similar to the Ratio setting on the compres-
sor except that you choose the decibel amount by which the gate 
attenuates (reduces) the signal. For example, a setting of 40 dB drops 
any signal below the Threshold setting by 40 decibels.

Introducing Gates and Expanders
589
✦Attack: Like with the compressor and limiter, use the Attack knob to set
the rate at which the gate opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well
for instruments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums. Slow attacks are
better suited for instruments with slow attacks, such as vocals.
✦Hold: Use the Hold setting to control how much time the gate stays
open after the signal drops below the threshold. When the hold time is
reached, the gate closes abruptly. This parameter is listed in millisec-
onds. The Hold parameter allows you to get the gated drum sound that
was so popular in the 1980s. (Phil Collins, anyone?)
✦Ratio: The ratio dictates how much the signal is attenuated by the
expander. When using a ratio of 2:1, for instance, the expander reduces
any signal below the threshold by two times. In this case, a signal that is
10dB below the threshold is reduced to 20dB below it; likewise, a signal
that’s 2dB below the threshold is reduced to 4dB below it. Setting a ratio
of 30:1 or greater turns the expander/gate effect to a gate. So, instead of
lowering the levels of an effected signal, the signal is simply cut off.
✦Release: Use the Release knob to control how long the gate is open after
the signal drops back below the threshold setting. You can choose
values between 5ms and 4 seconds. Faster release times are achieved
when the dial is to the left; conversely, turning the dial to the right
lengthens the release time.
✦Thresh: Use the Threshold knob to set the level (in decibels) at which
the gate opens (stops filtering the signal). The gate allows all signals
above the Threshold setting to pass through unaffected, whereas any
signals below the Threshold setting are reduced by the amount set by
the Range control.

✦Options: Look Ahead: Enabling this button (click it to turn it blue) turns
on the Look Ahead function for the Expander/Gate. This essentially
means that the Expander/Gate will engage 2ms before the sound actually
crosses the threshold value. This keeps you from losing the initial tran-
sient of an instrument, such as for drums.
✦Levels: The levels section of the Expander/Gate processor has four basic
functions:
• Phase Invert: This button, located to the right of the Levels title,
inverts the phase (reverses the sound wave) of your signal. Click this
button to engage and disengage it. It illuminates blue when it’s
engaged.
• Input: This meter shows the level of your signal entering the effect.
• Output: This meter shows the level leaving your effect.
• GR: GR stands for Gain Reduction. This meter shows you the
amount, in decibels, that your input level is attenuated.
✦Side Chain: This section lets you insert a side-chain into the effect. I
detail this in the “Setting Up Side Chains” section, later in this chapter.
Getting started using gates
Noise gates can be extremely useful for getting rid of unwanted noise. The
most common use for a gate is to eliminate bleeding from drum mics. For
example, you may get bleed from your snare drum into your tom-toms mics.
When using noise gates, keep the following in mind:
✦When the threshold is reached, the gate allows the signal through. If
your background noise is high enough, when the gate opens, you still
hear not only the intended sound but the background noise as well.
✦When gating drums, be sure to set the attack very fast. Otherwise, the
initial transient is lost, and you end up with mushy-sounding drums. You
can also engage the look-ahead option to ensure that the transients are
lost.
✦When setting the release time of the gate, adjust it until it sounds 
natural and doesn’t clip off the end of your instrument’s sound.
✦Set the range just high enough to mask any unwanted noise. If you set
it too high, the sound becomes unnatural because the natural resonance
of the instrument may be filtered out.
Getting started using an expander
Because the expander works much like a gate, you can use the same basic
starting points. Choose between a gate and an expander based on the type
of overall attenuation that you want of the signal. For example, the expander

Detailing the De-Esser

is a good choice if you have an instrument that contains sounds that are too
loud but you don’t want to get rid of them completely — you just want to
reduce them a little.
Adjusting for a vocalist’s breath is the perfect situation for using an expander
rather than a gate. In this case, you can set the expander’s threshold just
below the singer’s softest note and start with a low ratio (1.5:1 or 2:1, for
instance). See whether the breathiness improves. If it doesn’t, slowly move
the Ratio knob until you get the effect that you want.
Be careful not to overdo it, though. If the breath is too quiet compared with
the vocal, the vocal sounds unnatural.
Detailing the De-Esser
The De-Esser plug-in is handy for getting rid of the annoying s sounds in a
vocal track (often referred to as sibilance). You can also use it to get rid of
any high-frequency sounds, such as the whistles or the wind across a flute.
You’ll find the Pro Tools De-Esser (as shown in Figure 4-5) in the Dynamics
listing with the plug-in menu.
The De-Esser plug-in is simple to use, with only have four basic parameters
to adjust:
✦Freq: Use the Frequency parameter to select the frequency range
affected by the De-Esser. You’ll usually set this between around 4 kHz
and 12 kHz.
✦Range: Use this knob to choose the frequency that the De-Esser is 
being applied to. Select a range that hits the highest note of the sibilance
but not all the s sounds. You’ll have to use your ears to assess what
sounds natural.

✦HF Only: Engaging this parameter applies the De-Esser to the frequency
you set with the Frequency dial. Not selecting it not applies the De-Esser
evenly across the frequency spectrum. For most De-Essing tasks, 
I choose to have this feature enabled.
✦Listen: Enabling this option lets you hear the effect that the De-Esser has
on your audio signal. You want to use this to hear where the sibilance is
and to help you fine-tune your settings. I generally enable this feature
when I’m looking for the frequency of the sibilance.
✦Graph: The graph shows you where the De-Esser is working, including
how much gain reduction you’re getting and where this reduction fits in
the frequency spectrum. Try to avoid putting too much weight on the
graph and use your ears instead.
✦Levels: The levels section of the De-Esset processor has three basic
functions:
• Input: This meter shows the level of your signal entering the effect.
• Output: This meter shows the level leaving your effect.
• GR: GR stands for Gain Reduction. This meter shows you the
amount, in decibels, that your input level is attenuated by the effect.
Here’s how to use the De-Esser:
1. Insert De-Esser into your offending track after the compressor or lim-
iter (if you’re using one). Do this by clicking on the Insert drop-down
menu for your track and choosing Plug-in➪Dynamics➪De-Esser for a
mono track. For a stereo track, choose Multi-mono or Multi-channel
plug-in➪Dynamics➪De-Esser.
2. Adjust the frequency to the point where the offending s sound is
located.
3. Dial the range in until the s sound falls back far enough in the track to
sound natural.
You don’t want to eliminate sibilance altogether, or your vocal will lack pres-
ence and begin to sound muddy (unclear).
Setting Up Side Chains
Using a side chain means that the signal from another track (through one of
the buses) or from one of your interface inputs triggers your dynamics
processor into action. The signal that you choose to do the triggering is the
key input. Side chains are great for making tracks fit better in a dense mix or

letting a kick drum be heard when it plays at the same time as the bass
guitar. Not sure how to do this? Don’t worry, I provide some examples in the
following sections.
Setting up a side chain
Setting up a side chain in one of Pro Tool’s dynamics processors is easy with
the following steps:
1. Click to open the Key Input drop-down menu, located next to the little
key icon at the top of the plug-in window.
2. From the drop-down menu, choose the interface input or bus that has
the signal that you want to use to trigger the dynamics processor.
This routes the signal from that input or bus to the processor.
3. Click the External Key button to engage the side chain.
The External Key button is located in the Side Chain section on the right
side of the various plug-in windows. (Refer to Figure 4-2.)
4. Click the Key Listen button — located to the right of the External Key
button — to hear the signal coming through your selected key input.
5. Play your session and adjust the processor’s parameters until you get
the sound that you want.
The Side Chain section of Pro Tools Dynamics III plug-ins gives you the 
ability to use high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) filters within the
plug-in. This can be handy for keying into certain frequencies, thus making
the side chain more sensitive to certain frequencies. This section offers 
two options:
✦HF (High Frequency): Turn on this filter by clicking the In button to the
right of the top frequency dial in the Side Chain section of the plug-in.
You can control the following parameters:
• Band-Pass Filter: Engaging this filter (click it with your mouse; it will
glow blue) is similar to using a parametric EQ. (Chapter 3 in this
mini-book has more on parametric EQs.) Whatever frequency you
select with the HF Frequency Control button (see the following
bullet) is the center of the filter. Frequencies on either side of this
drop off at a rate of 12 dB per octave.
• Low-Pass Filter: Engaging this filter is the same as using a low-pass
filter in one of your EQs. (Chapter 3 in this mini-book has more on
low-pass filters.) Your selected frequency is the beginning of the 
low-pass filter, and all frequencies above this number are attenuated
(reduced) by 12 dB per octave.

• HF Frequency Control: Use this dial to choose from frequencies
between 80 Hz and 20 kHz. Turning to the right increases the 
frequency, and turning to the left decreases it.
✦LF (Low Frequency): Turn on this filter by clicking the In button, next 
to the bottom dial in the Side Chain section of the plug-in. You have
three options to select from with this filter. These are:
• Band-Pass Filter: Engaging this filter (click it with your mouse; it will
glow blue) is similar to using a parametric EQ. (Chapter 3 in this
mini-book has more on parametric EQs.) Whatever frequency you
select with the LF Frequency Control button (see the following
bullet) is the center of the filter. Frequencies on either side of this
drop off at a rate of 12 dB per octave.
• High-Pass Filter: Engaging this filter is the same as using a high-pass
filter in one of your EQs. (Chapter 3 in this mini-book has more on
high-pass filters.) Your selected frequency is the beginning of the
high-pass filter, and all frequencies higher than this number are
attenuated (reduced) by 12 dB per octave.
• LF Frequency Control: Use this dial to choose from frequencies
between 25 Hz and 4 kHz. Turning to the right increases the fre-
quency, and turning to the left decreases it.
Using a side chain
The uses for side chains are numerous, and only your creativity limits how
you end up using a side chain. The most common use for a side chain is to
create more room for your instruments in the mix. This is done by EQing 
the Key Input signal and then letting that EQed signal trigger a compressor
or limiter.
To make room for a vocal in a dense mix, follow these steps:
1. Route all your instruments in the mix (except the vocal) to bus 15 
and 16.
2. Insert the compressor plug-in in this bus and set the Key Input to 
bus 14.
3. Make a copy of your vocal tracks and assign their outputs to bus 14.
4. Shift the copied vocal tracks ahead (to the right) a few milliseconds.
5. Adjust the settings on the compressor so that the volume of the 
instruments drops slightly whenever the vocals come in.
For a starting point, use the smooth vocal compressor setting that 
I mention in the “Compressing vocals” section, earlier in this chapter.

Setting Up Side Chains
595
You can also use a special trick to make the bass guitar drop slightly in the
mix whenever the kick drum is played. Follow these steps:
1. Insert the compressor plug-in into the bass guitar track and set the
Key Input to bus 16.
2. Make a copy of the kick drum track and set the output for the copied
track to bus 16.
The kick signal triggers the compressor that’s assigned to the bass
guitar track.
3. Use fast Attack and Release settings on the compressor.
You want the compressor to activate only when the initial strike of the
kick drum happens. The bass guitar drops in volume when the kick
drum plays. This means that the kick drum creates the attack, and the
bass guitar produces the sustain.
This trick works really well for music that has a kick drum and bass guitar
that play similar patterns.

U
nless you record your songs using a live band in a perfect acoustic
environment, your music will sound a little flat without the addition of
some type of effects. Effects allow you to make your music sound like you
recorded it in just about any environment possible. You can make your
drums sound as if they were recorded in a cathedral or your vocals sound
as if you were singing underwater. Effects also have the ability to make you
sound better than the real you. For example, you can add harmony parts to
your lead or backup vocals, or you can make your guitar sound like you
played it through any number of great amplifiers.
In this chapter, you discover many of the most common effects processors
used in recording studios. (Signal processors are the neat software plug-ins
behind all the effects you can achieve in your Pro Tools studio.) You discern
the difference between insert (that is, line) effects and send/return effects.
You also get a chance to explore ways of using these processors, with 
recommendations for using reverb, delay, and chorus. To top it off, you get 
a glimpse into offline effects processing such as pitch-shifting.
The best way to learn how to use effects on your music is to experiment.
The more you play around with the different settings, the more familiar you
become with how each effect operates. Then you can get creative and come
up with the best ways to use effects for your music.
The Effects Bypass button in the Pro Tools effects-processor plug-in 
window is your friend. With a click of the Bypass button, you can quickly
turn off any effect in use with your signal. Use this button to check your
effect settings against your original signal. Sometimes you’ll like the original
sound better.

Routing Your Effects
598
Routing Your Effects
Effects processors can be used as either send/return or insert effects. In
both cases, you can work with the dry (unaffected) signal and the wet
(affected) signals separately. If you use the effect in a send/return routing,
you can adjust the wet and dry signals with two track faders: Aux Send
(opened by clicking the effect’s name in the Send list) and Auxiliary. If you
use the effect in a line configuration, the plug-in window displays a Mix
parameter where you can adjust the wet/dry balance.
You choose whether to insert an effect in a track or to use the Send function
based upon what you intend to do. For example, if you insert the effect into 
a track (as described in the next section), that effect only alters the signal
that exists on the track it’s inserted into. On the other hand, using an effect
send for your effect allows you to route more than one track through that
effect. (You can adjust the individual levels going to the send at each track
so you still have control over how much effect is applied to each track 
going to the send.)
In addition, inserting an effect always puts the effect before the fader in the
track (pre-fader); if you use a send, you can choose whether the effect does
its magic before (pre-fader) or after (post-fader) signal enters the fader that
controls the track’s output. If you use a send to apply the effect to more than
one track at a time, you also reduce the amount of processing power the
effect has to use. (Inserting the same effect into each track you want to alter
ends up using more processing power.)
Inserting effects
If you want to use an effect on only one specific track, you can insert it into
the track by using the Insert function. To insert an effect in Pro Tools, follow
these steps:
1. Make sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window by
choosing View➪Mix Window➪Inserts from the main menu.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip.
The Insert drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
3. If your track is a stereo track, select either the Multi-Channel Plug-In
or Multi-Mono Plug-In option.
If your track is mono, you don’t have a choice here. You’re stuck using a
mono plug-in.

Routing Your Effects
599
4. Choose your desired plug-in — D-Verb, Slap Delay, Long Delay, 
whatever — from the menu.
The plug-in window opens. Here you can set your parameters. (My 
professional advice on what settings to actually tweak comes later in
this chapter, when I cover the individual effects.)
Sending signals to effects
Sometimes, you want to route a bunch of tracks to a single effect (in the case
of reverbs, for instance). In this case, you follow these steps:
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in each track that you
want to route to the effect.
The Send Output window appears, as shown in Figure 5-2. The window
contains a handy channel strip for controlling the signal being sent to
the selected bus.

Rolling Out the Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. Reverb,
the natural characteristic of any enclosed room, results from sound waves
bouncing off walls, a floor, and a ceiling. A small room produces reflections
that start quickly and end soon; in larger rooms, halls, or cathedrals, the
sound has farther to travel, so you get slower start times and a longer-lasting
reverberation.
This room effect enables you to place your track closer to the imaginary
“front” or “back” of the mix. You do this by varying how much of the affected
signal you include with the unaffected one. For example, mixing a lot of
reverb with the dry (unaffected) signal gives the impression of being farther
away, so your instrument sounds like it’s farther back in the mix.
Seeing reverb settings
You can adjust several parameters when you use reverb, which gives you 
a lot of flexibility. Figure 5-3, which shows the Reverb plug-in that comes
with Pro Tools, gives you a peek at the parameters you can play with.

Rolling Out the Reverb
601
The following list explains how the parameters — most, but not all, visible in
Figure 5-3 — affect the sound of the reverb:
✦Algorithm: This setting lets you choose the type of room that the reverb
sounds like. You have the option of a hall, church, plate (a type of reverb
that uses a metal plate to create its sound), two different rooms, ambient
(natural room sound), and nonlinear (less natural) sound. Each choice
also sets the other parameters for the reverb, but you can adjust those
as you like to give your reverb a distinct sound.
✦Size: This option refers to the “room” choices you have in the Algorithm
setting. You have three settings to choose from: Small, Medium, and
Large. Clicking one of these options adjusts the rest of parameters in the
window, except for the Algorithm setting.
✦Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the “room”
you chose. A higher diffusion setting results in a thicker sound. Think of
the diffusion parameter as a way to simulate how reflective the room is.
More reflective rooms produce a much higher diffusion. To simulate a
less reflective room, use lower-diffusion settings.
✦Decay: Decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or more
reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
✦Pre-delay: A sound reaches your ears before the sound’s reverb does,
and predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning and the
start of the reverb, which is described in milliseconds (ms). Because
reverb is made up of reflections of sound within a room, the sound takes
time to bounce around the room and reach your ears. By then, you’ve
already heard the sound because it came directly to you. Predelay helps
to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This
parameter is essential in making your reverb sound natural.

A small room has a shorter predelay than a large room.
✦HF Cut: This setting allows you to control the rate at which the high fre-
quencies decay. Most of the time the high frequencies decay faster, so
being able to control this effect can result in a more natural sounding
reverb.
✦LP Filter: This filter controls the level of the high frequencies within the
reverb. Setting this frequency gives the impression of a darker (lower-
frequency setting) or brighter (higher-frequency setting) room.
Getting started using reverb
Reverb is like garlic: The more you use, the less you can taste it. Just like a
new chef puts garlic in everything (and lots of it), many budding engineers
make the same mistake with reverb. Go easy. Always remember that less is
more.
Here are some other things to keep in mind:
✦Mixes often sound better when you use reverb on only a few instru-
ments instead of them all. For example, it’s not uncommon for just the
snare drum of the drumset to have reverb on it. The rest of the drums
and cymbals remain dry (unaffected).
✦Try using reverb to “glue” instruments together. Routing all your drum
tracks to the same reverb, for instance, can make them sound like they
were all recorded in the same room. When doing this, make sure that
you adjust the Send level for each instrument so that the effect sounds
natural. Also, use less reverb for all the instruments than you would for
just one. This keeps the sound from becoming muddy from using too
much reverb.
✦Think about how you want each instrument to sit in the mix when you
choose reverb. Make sure that the type and amount of reverb fits the
song and the rest of the instruments.
✦Try putting the dry (unaffected) sound on one side of the stereo field
and the reverb on the other. For example, if you have a rhythm guitar
part that you set at 30 degrees off to the right of the stereo field, set the
reverb 30 degrees off to the left. This can be a nice effect.
✦To keep the vocals up front in the mix, use a short reverb setting.
A vocal plate is a great choice because the decay is fast. This adds a 
fair amount of the reverb to the vocal without making it sit way back in
the mix.
✦Experiment with room types, sizes, and decay times. Sometimes, a long
decay on a small room reverb sounds better than a short decay on a
large room or hall reverb.

Detailing Delay
603
Detailing Delay
Along with reverb, delay is a natural part of sound bouncing around a room.
When you speak (or sing or play) into a room, you often hear not only reverb
but also a distinct echo. This echo may be short or long, depending on the
size of the room. The original sound may bounce back to you as a single
echo or as multiple, progressively quieter delays.
Digging into delay settings
At your disposal are several types of delay effects, including a slap-back
echo, tape delay, and multiple delays. Each is designed to add dimension to
your instrument. To create these various effects, you adjust several parame-
ters, as the following list and Figure 5-4 make clear. The Delay plug-ins that
come with Pro Tools are pretty much the same. (Okay, the default setting for
each is different, but that’s a pretty minor thing.) The parameters that you
can adjust include the following.
✦Gain: This lets you set the signal level going into the delay.
✦Mix: This parameter controls the output level of the effect. The higher
you set this parameter, the louder the delayed signal is relative to the
original signal.
✦LPF: The Low Pass filter (LPF) lets you filter some of the high frequen-
cies from the delay.
✦Delay: This parameter controls the amount of time between the initial
signal and the repeated sound. The time is listed in milliseconds and can
be as short as a few milliseconds or as long as several seconds.
✦Depth: This parameter lets you add modulation to the delay so that you
can create a chorus effect. (See the “Creating Chorus Effects” section,
later in this chapter, for more on chorus and flange effects.) The higher
the level on this setting, the greater the modulation.

✦Rate: This setting lets you set the amount of time that the modulation
takes to cycle.
✦Feedback: The Feedback parameter controls how many times the echo
repeats. A low setting makes the echo happen just once, and higher 
settings produce more echoes.
Some of the Delay plug-ins in Pro Tools also allow you to set the delay to the
tempo of your song. The following list covers these settings:
✦Tempo Match: This option allows you to set the delay to beat in time
with the music. The Tempo Match feature is referenced to the tempo
map that you set for the song. You can set this parameter to any note
division, from sixteenth notes to whole notes, if you want the delays to
keep time with your song. (Quarter- and eighth-note delays are the most
commonly used note divisions.)
✦Meter: This lets you set the meter of the song and the subdivision that
you want the delay to follow. When you change this parameter, the Delay
parameter moves, too.
✦Groove: Use this parameter to adjust the rate of the delay in relation to
the tempo and subdivision you chose. By changing this setting, you alter
the delay (by percentages) away from the strict tempo and subdivision
settings. This can be useful if you’re adjusting the exact delay that you
want. When you adjust this parameter, the Delay setting changes as well.
Getting started using delay
Delay is used a lot in contemporary music, and many times, you don’t hear it
unless you listen carefully. Other times, it is prominent in the mix (for exam-
ple, the snare drum in some reggae music). Here are ways you can use delay
in your music:
✦One of the most effective ways to use delay is as a slap-back echo on
vocals. A slap-back echo consists of one to three repeats spaced very
closely together, which fattens the sound of the vocals. You generally
want to set your time parameter between 90 and 120 ms. Set the level so
you barely hear the first echo when your vocal is in the mix and adjust it
from there until you like the sound. In pop music, a slap-back echo and a
vocal plate reverb are commonly used on lead vocals. (It was really
common in the 1950s, and shows up a lot — less subtly — in rockabilly.)
The Slap Delay plug-in in Pro Tools is a good place to start, although the
default setting has a longer delay time than I recommend.
✦Use the Tempo Match feature to have your delay echo in time with the
music. This can add some depth to the mix without creating a muddy or
cluttered sound. Be careful because if you use this too much, it can
make your music sound annoyingly repetitive.

Creating Chorus Effects
605
Creating Chorus Effects
Chorus takes the original sound and creates a copy that is very slightly 
out of tune with the original and varies over time. This variance is modula-
tion, and the result is an effect that can add interest and variety to an instru-
ment. Chorus is used quite extensively to add fullness to an instrument,
particularly guitars and vocals. Pro Tools doesn’t come with a Chorus plug-
in per se, but all Delay plug-ins can produce chorusing effects by adjusting
the Depth and Rate parameters. (Check out the “Detailing Delay” section,
earlier in this chapter, for more on delays.)
If reverb is like garlic, then chorus is like cayenne pepper. You may get away
with a little too much garlic in your food without too much trouble, but if
you add too much cayenne, you run the risk of making your food inedible.
Such is the case with the chorus effect. Used sparingly, it can add a lot to
your music; overdone, it can wreak havoc on a good song.
Try the following tips for making the best use of chorus effects:
✦To fill out a vocal track, try setting the rate at 2 Hz, the depth at about 
20 to 30, and the delay at 10 to 20 ms. Keep the Feedback level low.
✦Use a chorus on backup vocals to make them much fuller and allow you
to use fewer tracks.
✦Pan the chorus to one side of the mix and the dry (unaffected) signal to
the other. This can be especially interesting on guitars and synthesizer
patches.

Chapter 6: Automating Your Mix
In This Chapter
 Understanding automation
 Writing automation
 Editing automation
 Playing automated tracks
You likely won’t have a session without a single change in level, pan, 
EQ, or plug-in parameters somewhere in the song. Unless you have an
external mixer or control surface, you’re stuck making these changes with
your mouse. The problem with all this mouse-intensive work is that you
can’t move more than one fader, panning knob, or plug-in setting at a time.
To be honest, the only way you can really mix within Pro Tools is by using
some kind of automation feature, which Pro Tools just happens to have in
spades. In fact, Pro Tools has a quite powerful automation engine that
allows you to control a variety of mix parameters.
Don’t like how the guitar in the second verse sits in the mix? No problem.
Just fix your automation data and mix it again. You can even save multiple
versions of these settings so you can create as many mixes as you want. (Be
careful here, though: When asked, most mix engineers say that they finish a
mix only when they run out of time or money to keep trying things.)
This chapter gets you going on mixing the new-fangled way: automatically.
Well, not exactly automatically — you still need to program these mixing 
settings, but I show you how to do that. In this chapter, I lead you through
automating the various aspects of your song — volume levels, mute and
panning placement, EQ, and plug-in settings. In addition, you discover how
to change your automation settings and also how to play the automation
data back so you’re ready to do your final mix.

Understanding Automation
608
Understanding Automation
You can automate a variety of parameters in Pro Tools. Each parameter 
has a playlist that contains its automation data. You can write this data one
parameter (or more) at a time, and you can display and edit the data even
while playing the session. This section describes the parameters you can
automate in audio, auxiliary, Master fader, instrument, and MIDI tracks.
Audio tracks
You can automate the following parameters in your audio tracks:
✦Volume: Use this parameter to control the overall volume of the track.
✦Pan: Use this to set the left/right balance of the track in the stereo field.
✦Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
✦Send: This parameter includes volume, mute, and panning settings for
the send, which is the routing section that lets you send part of your
track’s signal to an effect.
✦Plug-ins: You adjust these parameters within the Plug-In window.
Automation data for each of these parameters resides in a playlist that’s sep-
arate from the regions that contain your edits for that track. This allows you
to move the regions in and out of the track’s playlist without changing the
automation data for that track.
Auxiliary input tracks
You can automate the following parameters when you’re working with auxil-
iary input tracks:
✦Volume: Use this parameter to set the overall volume of your Aux track.
✦Pan: You can place your tracks anywhere from left to right in the stereo
field.
✦Mute: Use this to turn the track on and off.
Instrument tracks
You can automate the following parameters when you’re working with instru-
ment tracks:
✦Volume: Use this parameter to set the overall volume of the track.
✦Pan: Use this to set the left/right balance of the track in the stereo field.
✦Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.

Accessing Automation Modes
609
Master fader tracks
You can automate only Volume on Master fader tracks. It sets the overall
volume of the MIDI data.
MIDI tracks
You can automate the following parameters when you’re working with MIDI
tracks:
✦Volume: Use this parameter to set the overall volume of the MIDI data.
✦Pan: You can place your tracks anywhere from left to right in the stereo
field.
✦Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
✦Controller data: This includes a number of MIDI settings, including
options such as the modulation wheel, breath controller, and sustain.
Pro Tools stores the automation data for MIDI tracks — with the exception 
of Mute settings — within the MIDI region for that track. When you move a
region within a track’s playlist, the automation data (except for any Mute 
settings) moves along with the region.
Accessing Automation Modes
Pro Tools offers five automation modes: Auto Off, Auto Read, Auto Write,
Auto Touch, and Auto Latch. You access these modes by clicking the
Automation Mode selector in the channel strip of each track in the Mix
window or in the Track Controls section of the Edit window, as shown in
Figure 6-1. Each mode affects how automation data for a track are written 
or played back, which I cover in this section.

Setting Automation Preferences

Now for the particulars. Here’s what each mode actually does:
✦Auto Off: This mode turns off all automation data for the selected track.
✦Auto Read: This mode plays back the automation data for the selected
track.
✦Auto Write: This mode writes automation data for the selected 
parameter(s) while the session plays, thus overwriting any pre-existing
automation data in the process. When you stop playback after writing
automation in this mode, Pro Tools automatically switches the automa-
tion mode to Auto Touch (see the next bullet) so you don’t accidentally
erase this data next time you play back the session.
✦Auto Touch: Auto Touch mode writes automation data only when you
click a parameter with your mouse; it stops writing when you release the
mouse button. (See the upcoming Remember icon for control-surface
behavior in this mode.) At this point, your automated parameter returns
to any previously automated position, according to the time that you set
for AutoMatch on the Mixing tab of the Preferences dialog box. (See the
“Setting Automation Preferences” section, later in this chapter, for more
on the Preferences dialog box.) With Auto Touch, you can fix parts of
your previously recorded automation data without erasing what you
want to keep.
Auto Touch engages differently, depending on the control surface you
use. If you have touch-sensitive faders (like those on the Digi 003), new
automation data is written as soon as you touch a fader. If your control
surface doesn’t sport touch-sensitive faders, Auto Touch mode won’t
engage until you move a fader past the position it occupied in the 
previously written automation data (the pass-through point). After you
hit that point, automation data is written until you stop moving 
the fader.
✦Auto Latch: This mode works much like Auto Touch (see the previous
bullet). After you touch or move a parameter, new automation data is
written. The difference is that Auto Latch mode continues to write new
automation data until you stop playback.
Setting Automation Preferences
Pro Tools writes and plays back automation data differently, depending on
the preferences that you select. You set these preferences by opening the
Preferences dialog box — choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu 
to get there — and then clicking the Mixing tab (as shown in Figure 6-2).

Setting Automation Preferences
611
The preferences in the Automation section are where you specify how
automation behaves in Pro Tools:
✦Smooth and Thin Data After Pass: Selecting this check box tells 
Pro Tools to automatically smooth (even out the rough spots) and thin
automation data after you record your moves. (See the “Thinning
Automation” section, later in this chapter, for more on thinning.) This can
make your automation curves more manageable and also free memory
for your automation data. (See the last bullet item in this section.)
✦Degree of Thinning: From this drop-down menu, you determine the
amount of thinning applied to automation data when you select the
Smooth and Thin Data After Pass check box — or whenever you use the
Thin Automation command. (See the “Thinning Automation” section,
later in this chapter, for more about this command.)
✦Plug-in Controls Default to Auto-Enabled: Selecting this option puts 
all new plug-ins in Auto-Enabled mode when you choose to write
automation data.
✦Latching Behavior for Switch Controls in “Touch”: Selecting this 
check box makes switched controls (such as mute or a plug-in by-pass)
latch to their existing state unless a breakpoint is encountered — in
which case, the automation writing stops. If you stop your session while 
writing, the switch control automatically matches the underlying value.

✦Include Control Changes in Undo Queue: With this check box selected,
any changes to certain mixer controller data, such as a Fader level or
Pan dial, are put in the Undo line-up along with any other operations to
do. This means that if you choose to undo any prior operation, your 
control changes will be undone as well.
✦AutoMatch Time: Use this setting to control the amount of time it takes
for Pro Tools to return to written automation data when you stop
recording new data in Auto Touch mode.
✦After Write Pass, Switch To: Here, choose the automation mode that
your session switches to after you record some automation data. You
can choose between Touch, Latch, and No Change (maintaining the
same mode you were in when you recorded your automation.
Enabling Automation
You can enable or suspend automation parameters on all tracks by using 
the Automation window (choose Window➪Automation) or on individual or
grouped tracks by using the automation drop-down menu (located in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window). Here, you can play with all the
parameters for audio tracks that I list in the “Understanding Automation”
section, earlier in this chapter, except for plug-ins, which are controlled in
their respective windows.
Suspending or enabling automation across all tracks
To enable or suspend the writing of automation data across all the tracks in
your session, do the following:
1. Choose Window➪Automation from the main menu.
The Automation window appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. The default
setting for this window is that all parameters are enabled: All parame-
ters are highlighted. In the case of Figure 6-3, only the Volume parameter
is enabled, meaning that when you set your track to one of the automa-
tion writing modes (Auto Write, Auto Latch, or Auto Touch), the only
automation that is written is Volume data.
2. To suspend automation across all tracks, perform one of the following:
• To suspend a single control: Click the name of an enabled parameter
in the Automation window to deselect it. It’s no longer highlighted.
• To suspend all the available parameters: Click the Suspend button.

Enabling Automation
613
3. To enable automation across all tracks, perform one of the following:
• To enable a single control: Click the name of the parameter in the
Automation window. It becomes highlighted.
• To enable all the available parameters: Press the Suspend button to
deselect it.
Suspending automation for an individual track
You can suspend or enable reading or writing of automation without using
the Automation window. In order to do this, though, you need to make sure
that you haven’t suspended automation via the Automation window. (See the
preceding section.) You can suspend or enable automation for a single track
or a group of tracks in a session by doing the following:
1. Click and hold the Automation selector in the Track Controls section of
the Edit window and then drag to the Automation parameter (Volume,
Mute, Pan, Send Level, or Send Mute) that you want to suspend 
or enable.
2. Perform one of the following steps:
• To suspend automation writing or reading for the control selected in the
automation playlist: Ô-click (Mac) or Ctrl-click (PC) that control —
Mute, Volume, Pan, whatever — in the Track View Selector in the
Track control section of the Edit window.
• To suspend automation writing and reading of a singe control across all
tracks: Ô+Option-click (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt-click (PC) or the control in
one Track View Selector in the Track control section of the Edit
window.
• To suspend automation writing and reading of all controls in a single
track: Ô+Shift-click (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift-click (PC) or any control in
the Track View Selector in the Track control section of the Edit
window.
To enable these parameters, repeat the preceding steps to toggle between
Suspend and Enable.

Writing Automation
614
Writing Automation
Writing automation is easy — simply enable the parameter for which you
want to write automation data, choose your automation mode, and then
adjust the parameter as the session plays. The following sections detail this
process.
While automation is written, it appears in your track as breakpoints with
lines (ramps) between these points. The breakpoints are placed in the
track’s automation playlist: that is, the playlist section of the track when you
have the Tracks view set to one of the Automation views via the Track View
drop-down menu. The number of breakpoints that appear is determined 
by the complexity of the changes to the automation levels and also by your
setting in the Degree of Thinning drop-down menu on the Mixing tab of the
Preferences dialog box. (Check out the “Setting Automation Preferences”
section earlier in this chapter.)
When the Smooth and Thin Data After Pass check box is enabled, choosing
None from the Degree of Thinning drop-down menu (refer to Figure 6-2) 
creates lots of breakpoints — you might not even notice any lines between
them. Comparatively, selecting Most from the drop-down menu creates many
fewer breakpoints, with longer, more pronounced lines between them. Pro
Tools places lines between these breakpoints to connect them. These lines
follow the level from one breakpoint to another, going up, down, or staying
the same. The combination of breakpoints and connecting lines represent
the automation curves for your track.
To keep from accidentally erasing or overwriting automation data, suspend
the writing of automation for the parameter by using one of the methods of
suspending automation listed in the preceding section.
Writing automation on a track
To write automation on a track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Automation from the main menu.
The Automation window appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
2. In the Automation window, click the buttons of the parameters you
want to enable.
3. Select Auto Write in each track you want to write to (choose Auto
Touch or Auto Latch for subsequent times) by clicking the Automation
selector.
Find the Automation selector in the Edit menu, as you can read in Book II,
Chapter 4.

Writing Automation
615
4. Click Play in the Transport Window or press the spacebar to start
your session.
5. Move the control for the parameters you want to automate.
For example, move the track’s fader (located in the Channel strip of the
Mix window) up and down to record changes in the volume level of your
track.
6. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the spacebar to stop 
the session.
Your automation shows up as a line with breakpoints (little dots) in the
track’s playlist — that is, as long as you have the automation view visi-
ble. If this view isn’t visible, click the Track View selector in the Track
Controls section of the Edit window to open the Track view drop-down
menu and then select the automation parameter — Volume, Pan, Mute,
Send Level, Send Mute — you want to view.
If this was your first pass writing automation and you have Auto Write mode
chosen, Pro Tools automatically switches the Automation mode to Touch
when you’re done.
To write over the first pass, start anywhere within the session by clicking
within the track or along the Timeline where you want the automation data
to start.
To overwrite switched controls (such as mute, solo, and plug-in bypasses),
simply click and hold the button down while the session plays. Pro Tools
writes new automation data as long as the switch is depressed, based upon
the current state of the control (On or Off).
Writing plug-in automation
Here’s how to write automation data for plug-in parameters:
1. In the Mix window, click the name of the plug-in in the Insert section
of the track’s channel strip.
The particular Plug-In window appears.
2. Click the Auto button in the upper-right of the Plug-In window.
The Plug-In Automation dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
3. Select the parameters you want to automate by clicking them in the
column on the left and then clicking Add.
The selected parameters are added to the column on the right.

4. Click OK.
The dialog box closes.
5. Click Play in the Transport Window (or press the spacebar) to start
your session.
6. Carefully move the control for the parameters you want to automate.
7. Click Stop in the Transport window (or press the spacebar) to stop 
the session.
Your automation shows up as a line with breakpoints (little dots) in the
track’s playlist as long as you have the automation view visible. If it’s not
visible, click the Track View selector in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window to open the Track View drop-down menu and select the
automation parameter — Volume, Pan, Mute, Send Level, Send Mute —
you want to view.
After you finish writing the automation for the plug-in, click the Safe button
in the upper-right part of the Plug-In window to make sure that you don’t
accidentally record over the plug-in automation.
Writing send automation
To write automation data for Send Level, Mute, and Pan settings, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Automation from the main menu.
The Automation window appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
2. In the Automation window, click the buttons of the Send parameters
that you want to enable.

Drawing Automation
618
Drawing Automation
Aside from being able to record automation data by moving the parameter
while your session plays (as I discuss in the chapter up to this point), you
can manually draw automation with the Pencil tool. This can be handy for
those visual people (you now who you are) who prefer to see what they’re
doing. Note: Just be sure you know what it’s going to sound like: It is music,
after all. Seriously, using the Pencil tool to draw automation can make 
creating fades or correcting automation data quick and easy.
You can draw your automation using the Pencil tool in the Edit window. 
The Pencil tool lets you draw seven different shapes, as shown in Figure 6-6.
Access the various pencil shapes by clicking and holding the Pencil tool.
✦Freehand: With this tool, you can freely draw automation curves — 
the changes to the settings for your automation data. If you’re automating
an audio track, the shape of the curve you draw determines the number of
breakpoints (discrete levels) that Pro Tools creates. MIDI tracks follow the
preferences you set on the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
Here’s how you specify that MIDI setting:
a. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
b. Click the MIDI tab.
c. Enter a value in the Pencil Tools Resolution When Drawing Controller
Data text box.
✦Line: Using this tool draws a straight line. For audio tracks, you get two
breakpoints: one at the beginning and one at the end. MIDI tracks create
breakpoints based upon the resolution setting in the MIDI tab of the
Preferences dialog box.
✦Triangle: Using this tool creates a sawtooth pattern that follows the cur-
rent grid value. Like with the Line tool, audio tracks contain two break-
points (one at the beginning and one at the end of each line), and MIDI
tracks are stepped according to the resolution you set on the MIDI tab of
Preferences dialog box.
Figure 6-6:
The Pencil
Tool offers

Thinning Automation
619
✦Square: Using this tool draws a square pattern that repeats according to
the current grid setting.
✦Random: Using this tool creates random levels that change according to
the grid value.
✦Parabolic: This tool is not available for automation.
✦S-Curve: Add text here. This tool is not available for automation.
So here’s where automation gets visual and, well, kind of magical. To use the
Pencil tool to draw automation, follow these steps:
1. In the Edit window, click the Track view selector in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window to access the Track View drop-down menu.
Then select the automation parameter you want.
The waveform fades in the track’s playlist, and the automation line
appears.
2. Click and hold the Pencil Tool icon until the drop-down menu
appears; then drag your mouse through the menu to choose the tool
you want.
3. Click and drag within the automation line on the track’s playlist
where you want the data drawn.
The new automation data replaces any existing data.
Thinning Automation
When you write, automation breakpoints are created at a maximum density.
Depending on the shape of the curve, you might not need all these break-
points to get an accurate playback of your moves. Because every breakpoint
requires at least some computer memory, removing unnecessary break-
points can be helpful. This is thinning, which can be done automatically or
with the help of the Thin command.
Automatically thinning data
Pro Tools can automatically thin your automation data for you: namely,
immediately after you write it. You can make it all happen from the Mixing
tab of the Preferences dialog box, which you can open by choosing
Setup➪Preferences from the main menu and then clicking the Mixing tab.
From the Mixing tab, you enable automatic thinning by selecting the Smooth
and Thin Data After Pass check box. Then, choose how much thinning you
want by specifying an amount in the Degree of Thinning drop-down menu.
(Refer to Figure 6-2.) The default setting is Some. (Is that sufficiently vague,
or what?)
Book VI
Chapter 6
Automating 
Your Mix

Editing Automation Data
620
You can always thin your automation data further — at any time — by using
the Thin command. To be safe, I always keep either Little or Some selected
in the Degree of Thinning drop-down menu.
Using the Thin command
If the need for thinning doesn’t become apparent until well into your creative
process, you can use the Thin command to thin a selection at any time. To
do so, follow these steps:
1. Display the automation data you want to thin by using the Track View
selector located in the Track Control’s section of the Edit window.
2. With the Selector tool, select the section in the playlist that you want
to thin.
3. Choose Edit➪Thin Automation from the main menu.
To thin all data for your selected parameter in a track, press Ô+A (Mac) or
Ctrl+A (PC) to select all the data. Then choose Edit➪Thin Automation from
the main menu.
You select the degree of thinning from the Degree of Thinning drop-down
menu on the Mixing tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setup➪
Preferences to access this dialog box.)
To check your thinning — basically to make sure that it still sounds good —
play the thinned section. If you don’t like what you hear, you can choose
Edit➪Undo from the main menu to undo the thinning.
Editing Automation Data
At your disposal are many ways to edit automation data after it’s written.
You can use one of the Edit tools (Grabber, Pencil, or Trimmer), you can
cut/copy/paste, and (if you want to get drastic) you can delete your 
automation. These options are covered in the following sections.
Using editing commands
You can use standard Edit commands (such as Cut, Copy, Delete, and Paste)
to edit your automation data. To edit using these commands, though, select
the data first. Here’s how:
1. From the Track View selector in either the Edit or Mix window, 
display the automation parameter you want to edit.
2. With the Selector tool, highlight the section in the playlist you want 
to edit.

Editing Automation Data
621
If you’re looking at the track in Waveform or Block view (for audio
tracks) or in Block, Region, or Notes view (for MIDI tracks), your edits
affect all automation data for the selected section. To edit an individual
parameter, display it in the Track View.
Grouped audio tracks are all edited (except when you’re editing panning
data) when you select data from one track in a group. To edit only the data
on the selected track, press Ô (Mac) or Windows (PC) when you perform
your edit.
Grouped MIDI tracks are edited individually (except for panning data) unless
you press Control (Mac) or Windows (PC) while you perform your edit.
Panning data works in two opposite ways for groups of audio tracks and
MIDI tracks. If you want to edit the panning data for a group of audio tracks,
you have to press Ô (Mac) or Windows (PC) while you edit — which affects
the entire group. Using this keystroke command (pressing Ô or Windows) on
a group of MIDI tracks, however, edits panning data one track at a time.
Cut and Delete
You get rid of unwanted stuff when you cut and delete automation data, but
the Cut and Delete commands treat unwanted stuff a bit differently:
✦Cut: When you cut a selection of automation data, Pro Tools automati-
cally adds two new breakpoints to your remaining data and places the
cut material on the Clipboard. The two new breakpoints are placed at
the beginning and end of the cut section. Any slope in automation
curves that exist before and after the cut section remain, as shown in
Figure 6-7.
In Pro Tools, cut by choosing Edit➪Cut from the main menu or by 
pressing Ô+X (Mac) or Ctrl+X (PC).

✦Delete: When you delete selected automation data, the remaining
automation data connects at the nearest breakpoints. Any curves
between the breakpoints and the beginning or end of the deleted 
selection are removed, as shown in Figure 6-8.
In Pro Tools, delete by choosing Edit➪Delete from the main menu or 
by pressing Delete (Mac) or Backspace (PC).
Copy
Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu to place copied data held on the
Clipboard so you can paste it somewhere else.
Paste
When you choose Edit➪Paste from the main menu to paste selected automa-
tion data in a new location, breakpoints are created at the beginning and end
points of the selection. These breakpoints make sure that the automation
levels and slope (change in level) that exist before the beginning and end
points of the pasted material remain the same, as shown in Figure 6-9.

Editing with (surprise!) the edit tools
You can use the editing tools located in the Edit window to change automa-
tion data within a track. The three tools you can use are the Grabber tool,
the Trimmer tool, and the Pencil tool. These are detailed in the following 
sections.
Grabber
Use the Grabber tool to move, add, and delete breakpoints. To perform these
operations, do the following:
✦Adding breakpoints: To add a breakpoint with the Grabber tool, click in
the automation line where you want the new breakpoint.
✦Deleting breakpoints: To delete a breakpoint from an automation line,
put the Grabber tool on it and then press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while
you click.
✦Moving breakpoints: To move a breakpoint, click and drag it to where
you want it.
Pencil
You can add or delete breakpoints with the Pencil tool by doing the following:
✦Adding breakpoints: To add a breakpoint with the Pencil tool, click in
the automation line at the place where you want the new breakpoint.
✦Deleting breakpoints: To delete a breakpoint, put the Pencil tool on it
and then press Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) while you click.
Trimmer
Use the Trimmer tool to move selected breakpoints up or down by clicking
and dragging them, as shown in Figure 6-10.

Chapter 7: Making Your Mix
In This Chapter
 Submixing your tracks
 Mixing within Pro Tools
 Mixing to an external recorder
T
he final step in mixing your music involves taking all your EQed, 
panned, processed, and automated tracks and recording them into a
stereo pair of tracks. This is often called bouncing your mix. In the old
analog days, bouncing meant sending all your tracks to two separate tracks
on the same tape deck or to a different tape deck. Nowadays, with Pro 
Tools, you can create bounces several ways — all of which I cover in this
chapter.
In this chapter, I lead you through making your mix either within Pro 
Tools (in-the-box) or by sending your tracks to a digital or an analog two-
track machine — usually a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) or (yes, even today) a
reel-to-reel tape deck.
Unless you have a seriously great analog deck and you want to add some of
that sought-after “warmth-of-analog” tape sound to your final mix, your best
bet is to go with the in-the-box approach — using the Pro Tools Bounce to
Disk feature and keeping your music in your computer.
Submixing by Recording to Tracks
Submixing is mixing some of your tracks down to one or two additional
tracks within your session. When you record to tracks, the submixed 
material automatically shows up in your session. You can then turn off 
the voices of the tracks that you submixed and control the resulting 
track(s) from one (or two) fader(s). This is handy if the following scenarios
apply:

Submixing by Recording to Tracks
626
✦You have more than 32 tracks (or 24, if you have an older version of
Pro Tools) in your song that you want to mix. For example, you can
reduce your track count by submixing your drums or backup vocals to
two tracks and then using only those two for the final mix. Book II,
Chapter 3 has more on available tracks.
✦You have MIDI tracks and want to record the audio output from your
MIDI devices to audio tracks before doing your final mix. Your MIDI
tracks are just instrument-control data; they contain no recorded sound.
At some point in the process of mixing, you need to record the actual
audio output from your sound source to your audio tracks.
✦You want to record your final mix in real time and still be able to
move the faders and other controls while your session plays. Some
recordists get antsy when Bounce to Disk mode (see the upcoming 
section, “Mixing in-the-Box”) creates the bounce offline because it 
prevents them from adjusting any controls as the mix is created. (Hey,
call it a control issue.)
To create a submix by recording to tracks, follow these steps:
1. Set your effects, panning, and EQ settings for the tracks you want to
submix.
2. Using the Output selector, assign the outputs for all tracks you want 
to submix (including any auxiliary tracks that your Send effects are
routed to) to one of the stereo bus paths (buses 1 and 2, for instance).
3. Choose Track➪New from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
4. Use the drop-down menus in the New Track dialog box to enter the
number of tracks you want (1), the type (Audio), and whether you
want your track in mono or stereo.
5. If you created a stereo track to submix to, set the panning of the right
track to hard right and that of the left track to hard left (see Book VI,
Chapter 2).
6. Set the Input selector for the track you create in Step 4 to the same
bus path that you chose for the tracks you want to submix (buses 
1 and 2, in this case).
7. Using the new track’s Output selector, select the main output for your
session as the output path for the track.
8. Make sure that your Edit and Timeline selections are linked by 
choosing Options➪Link Edit and Timeline Selections from the main
menu.

Book VI
Chapter 7
Making Your Mix
Mixing in-the-Box
627
Linking Edit and Timeline selections means the Timeline selection range
follows the selection you make in a track’s playlist.
9. With the Selector tool, select the section of the session that you want
to submix.
If you want to record the entire session, be sure to put your cursor at
the beginning of the session before you record it. If you want to record
only part of the session, select the part you want. (Book IV, Chapter 2
details this process.)
10. Click the Record Enable button on the new track.
11. Click Record in the Transport window.
12. Click Play in the Transport window.
The submix process begins.
13. Press Stop in the Transport window when you finish.
If you selected part of the session to record, the session stops playing
automatically when it reaches the end of your selection.
Be sure to let the session play until the last bit of reverb or other effect
is finished playing to avoid cutting off the effect.
Mixing in-the-Box
Mixing in-the-box refers to using the Bounce to Disk feature in Pro Tools 
to create your final mix. The Bounce to Disk feature processes your audio
tracks in real time (you can hear the session while it plays) but offline, 
meaning that you can’t manipulate any controls when the bounce is 
happening.
Pro Tools creates a new file with the settings that you choose in the Bounce
dialog box. What you get is a file that you can import back into your session;
then, you can play back your Bounced mix and evaluate how it sounds. 
The advantage of using the Bounce to Disk feature over recording to tracks
(as described earlier in the “Submixing by Recording to Tracks” section) is
that you don’t need to have any extra voices available to receive the
bounced files.
Examining bounce options
You access the Bounce dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-1, by choosing File➪
Bounce To Disk from the main menu.

Mixing in-the-Box
628
Here, you set the following options:
✦Source: Use the Bounce Source drop-down menu to select any output or
bus path as your source for the bounce. (Figure 7-2 gives you a peek at
some of the choices.)
✦File Type: Use this drop-down menu to set the file type for the bounced
file. You have many choices — Book II, Chapter 5 details them all — but
for your final mix, these common, Pro-Tools-supported file types are the
ones to choose from:
• BWF (WAV): This file type, which is the standard for older, PC-based
Pro Tools systems, is currently the most commonly used file type.
(One big reason is that BWF files are compatible with both Macs and
PCs.) This is the type I generally choose.

Chapter 7
Making Your Mix
Mixing in-the-Box
629
• AIFF: Audio Interchange File Format files used to be native to Macs.
AIFF files can be imported without converting into any Pro Tools ses-
sion — including those on a PC — but because BWF is becoming the
standard, I skip this type. If you use a Mac and you plan to do your
mastering on your Mac with Pro Tools, this file type is a fine choice.
✦Format: This drop-down menu determines whether your bounced file is
in Mono, Multiple Mono, or Stereo Interleaved. These formats do have
some differences that are good to know:
• Mono (Summed): Choosing this option creates a single audio file that
contains all the material without any panning information.
Because any stereo information is summed, getting too high of a
combined signal is easy. This results in clipping (distortion). If you
want to record in this format, make sure that you reduce your levels
so that the left and right channels peak at no more than –3 db,
although –6 dB is better. (Chapter 1 in this mini-book has more on
setting levels.)
• Multiple Mono: This format puts the left and right channels of your
stereo mix in separate files, labeling the files with the .L and .R
filename extensions, respectively.
Multiple mono is the file format supported by Pro Tools, which
makes it the one to use if you intend to master your music yourself
within Pro Tools. If you plan to use a professional mastering engineer,
call him to see what file format works with the mastering equipment.
(It will either be multiple mono or stereo interleaved.)
• Stereo Interleaved: This format contains all stereo information in a
single stereo file. Panning information is retained. Any tracks set to
even-numbered outputs end up on the right side of the stereo file;
tracks set to odd-numbered outputs go to the left side of the 
stereo field.
✦Resolution: Use this setting to choose one of three bit rates for your
bounced files: 8, 16, or 24. (Book I, Chapter 1 has more on resolution.)
For your final mix, choose 24 bit (maximum resolution). You can reduce
it as needed later, either when you master your music yourself or when
you have a professional do it for you.
✦Sample Rate: You can save your file with any of several sample rates,
but I recommend saving it with the same rate as the files in your session.
Check out Book I, Chapter 2 for all the details about sample rates.
If you intend to have your music mastered by a professional, make sure
to ask her what she prefers. Some mastering engineers want the files at
the highest sample rate possible while others would rather have you not
change the rate.

Using an External Master Deck
630
✦Conversion Quality: If you choose a sample rate different from the 
files in your session — which I don’t recommend — you’re prompted to
choose a level of quality for the conversion. Choose the highest quality
possible for your mix material, but keep in mind that the higher the 
quality you choose, the longer it takes to do the conversion process.
Performing the bounce
To use the Bounce to Disk feature, first make sure that all your tracks are
how you want them. Check all routing, automation, effects, and EQ settings
to make sure they’re right. Then do the following:
1. Choose File➪Bounce to Disk from the main menu.
The Bounce dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 7-1.)
2. Set your Bounce options to the settings you want.
3. Click Bounce.
The Save Bounce As dialog box opens.
4. In the Save As dialog box, choose a destination point for this file,
enter the name of this mix, and then click Save.
The session plays while the bounce happens.
Using an External Master Deck
You can mix to an external device instead of mixing within Pro Tools. This
section explains how to mix to both analog and digital recorders.
You can mix to an external digital device (such as a DAT deck) or, for you
“classic technology” fans, to an analog device (such as a reel-to-reel tape
recorder). Just follow these steps:
1. Connect your device to your Digidesign interface.
For digital recorders, run a cable from the digital outputs of the interface
to the digital inputs of your device. You’ll need to use either an optical
or a coaxial connection, depending on the interface.
For analog recorders, run a cable from two of the analog outputs of the
interface to the inputs of your device.
2. (Optional) If you want to be able to monitor this device while it
records, connect the device’s outputs to your monitors (speakers) or
plug your headphones into the headphone jack (if your device 
has one).

Book VI
Chapter 7
Making Your Mix
Using an External Master Deck
631
3. Using the Output selectors, set the output of your tracks, auxiliary
inputs, and Master fader to the physical outputs of your interface.
These must correspond to the output you connected your device to.
4. Enable recording in your external device.
5. Click Play in the Transport window of your Pro Tools session.
6. Adjust your input levels on your external device.
7. Rewind the session.
8. Start recording on the external device and immediately press the
spacebar or click Play in the Transport window.
The session plays, and you record it into your external device.
9. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the spacebar when the
music is done.
You have a mix recorded into your external device. (Look out, world,
here it comes. . . .)

Chapter 1: Mastering Basics
In This Chapter
 Understanding mastering
 Knowing when to master your music yourself
 Knowing when to send your music to a mastering house
You spent a lot of time getting all your tracks recorded and using the
best mics you can afford — mics you carefully set up following the
guidelines in Book III, Chapter 2, I hope! You adjusted your levels just right,
EQed, panned, and added effects to each instrument with great care so they
fit perfectly in the mix. Now you have awesome-sounding music. All that’s
left is to burn a CD, create cool cover artwork, and make some copies —
then you’re ready to go platinum, right?
Well, you could do that, but you’d miss one of the most important steps in
getting your music to sound its very best: mastering. Mastering can turn
your already good music into a truly great CD. The problem is that most
people have no idea what mastering is. It’s been presented as some mysteri-
ous voodoo that only people who belong to some secret society and have
access to a magical pile of gear can do.
This isn’t the case, though. Mastering is, in fact, a pretty simple process,
involving some plug-ins in Pro Tools that I show you how to use earlier in
this book. Mastering does require specialized skills, but you don’t need to
go through any strange initiation rites to master (get it, master?) them. 
All it takes is an idea of what to do, decent ears (you have a couple of those,
right?), and a dose of patience while you work your way through the
process.
In this chapter, you get a chance to understand the “magic” that is master-
ing. You discover what’s involved in mastering your music. You explore
ways to make sure that your music is ready to master and discern when it
might be best to find a professional to do the job for you.

Demystifying Mastering
636
Demystifying Mastering
Mastering involves preparing your music for duplication. Several steps 
are involved in taking your songs from individual, mixed tunes to part of a
whole album. First, you need to optimize the dynamics and tonal balance of
each song, and then process the songs so they match in volume with each
other. These steps usually involve putting the songs through some EQing,
compressing, limiting, and sometimes expanding.
You also need to sequence your music — put your songs in the best order
possible, with an appropriate amount of time between songs. Your last 
step is to put your mastered music into a format — and a medium — that
enables you to duplicate and distribute (hey, even sell!) it. This format and
medium is usually a CD. (I describe this process in detail in Book VIII,
Chapter 1.)
Processing
No matter how well you recorded and mixed your music, you still need 
to do some processing during the mastering stage. This usually consists of
adjusting levels with compression, limiting, EQing, and (if needed) additional
processing. Luckily, all this can be done right in Pro Tools, using the plug-ins
that came with the software. The plug-ins that you use when mastering are
covered in detail in Book VI, Chapters 3 and 4.
The purpose of the processing stage is to do the following:
✦Balance the overall tonal characteristics of each song.
✦Optimize the dynamics of each song so all the songs are at their best
overall volume.
You can achieve these goals by using the following tools:
✦Compression: Some music sounds best when it’s smooth, and other
music is much better when it has a punchy quality to it. Judicious use of
a Pro Tools Compressor plug-in can produce either of these effects. A
good mastering engineer knows when and how to make music punchy or
smooth. (Sorry, you can’t have both at the same time.)
✦Limiters: If any instruments are too high in comparison with the rest 
of the mix, using a Pro Tools Limiter plug-in can tame them so you get
the best overall difference between the songs’ peak levels and average
levels. This difference varies depending on the style of music, but it
should never be less than 6 decibels (dB) and is usually between 12dB
and 18dB. (For more on limiter plug-ins, see Book VI, Chapter 4.)

Getting Ready to Master
637
✦EQ: Because you record and mix each of your songs over a period of
time (often a long period of time), chances are that each song sounds a
little different. Some might be brighter than others, and some might be
heavier on bass, but one thing’s for sure — each will have a different
tonal quality.
Sequencing
Sequencing involves putting your songs in the order that you want and then
setting the space between each song so that the CD flows well from one song
to another. Because a CD is supposed to represent a cohesive body of work,
this is one of the most important aspects of mastering.
Leveling
A crucial aspect of mastering a CD is leveling — getting the levels of all the
songs the same. After all, you don’t want your listener to adjust the volume
of his stereo from one song to another. Having consistent levels from song to
song helps with the cohesiveness and flow of a CD. This is done by using
simple gain adjustments, compressors, and/or limiters. And by making those
processes consistent, Pro Tools gives us mere mortals a crack at doing 
it right.
Getting Ready to Master
You can save yourself a ton of time and energy when mastering your music 
if you keep a few things in mind during the mixing stage. When wearing your
Mixing Master hat, the following reminders can make the mastering process
go a bit more smoothly:
✦Check your levels. Listen to your mix quietly to tell whether one instru-
ment sticks out too much in the mix. Also, burn a CD of your mixed song
to test on other playback systems, such as your car, a boom box, or your
friend’s stereo system. Listen carefully. If the bass drum is even slightly
too loud, it eats up headroom that the rest of the instruments need, so
you can’t get the overall volume of the song very high.
✦Check your EQ. Even though the mastering engineer (you or a pro) EQs
the entire song, the time you spent getting each instrument EQed in the
mix is still a good investment. If you didn’t get your EQ just right during
the mixing process, and (for example) a muddy bass guitar sound has 
to be EQed during mastering, you lose some of the low end on all the
instruments. This makes your mix sound thin. If your bass is EQed 
properly in the first place, you don’t have to make that adjustment to
the entire mix.
Book VII
Chapter 1
Mastering Basics

Paying a Pro, or Doing It Yourself
638
✦Test your mix in mono. That is, turn off the stereo panning on your
master bus. This helps you hear whether any instrument’s volume or
tonal characteristics are seriously out of balance with others. I never
consider a mix to be finished until I monitor it in mono.
✦Apply compression on your mix before you record the two-track mix.
That way, you can hear what your music sounds like compressed.
Don’t record the compression, though. Leave that for the mastering
stage. By testing your mix with some compression, you might hear
whether certain instruments are too loud in the mix; if so, they become
more apparent when compressed.
✦Listen for phase holes. Phase holes occur when you record an instru-
ment (such as a piano or backup vocals) in stereo, and the left and right
tracks are out of phase. (Book III, Chapter 2 has more in avoiding phase
holes when you record.) To listen for phase holes, pay attention to how
the instrument sounds in the stereo field. You have a phase hole if you
hear sound coming only from the far right and far left and nothing
coming from the center of the stereo field. If you have this problem, all
you have to do is reverse the phase on one of the two channels for that
instrument. You do this by inserting the One-Band EQ plug-in in one of
the tracks (keep the Gain set to 0) and clicking the phase Invert button
(this is the little 0 with a line through it next to the Input button).
Paying a Pro, or Doing It Yourself
Whether to master your music yourself or to hire a professional might be
one of your toughest music-making decisions. If you master your music 
yourself, you can have complete control from start to finish and save your-
self some bucks. On the other hand, if you hand your mixed music over to a
skilled professional, you can have the added benefit of another person’s ears
and advice, and you can end up with a finished product that far exceeds
your expectations.
So how do you choose?
Well, your first consideration is probably based upon economics. Do you
have the money to spend on professional help (for your music, that is)?
Mastering can cost anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. 
A midline mastering engineer often charges around $500 to master your CD
(about ten songs). This might seem like a lot of money, but finding the right
engineer for your music can make the difference between a decent CD and 
a truly world-class one.
Another consideration for hiring out your mastering is how well you know
your equipment and how capable it is of performing the mastering proce-
dure. To do mastering, you need at least one good (well, preferably great)

Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
639
multiband compressor, a limiter, and a great multiband parametric EQ. The
plug-ins that come with Pro Tools can get you most of the way to a great-
sounding master. If you really get into mastering in Pro Tools, you can add
some third-party plug-ins (such as the Waves or PSPaudioware brands) that
offer better sound and more flexibility. You also need to have a CD burner of
some sort and the software to create a Red Book CD master. (Find more
about CD burners and Red Book standards in Book VIII, Chapter 1.)
Before you decide, take a look at other benefits of hiring a skilled professional
to do your mastering:
✦A meticulously tuned room and top-notch monitors: With this equip-
ment, you can hear what your music actually sounds like.
✦Equipment specifically designed to handle mastering: EQs, compres-
sors, and other gear that a mastering house uses can tweak your music
to sound its best.
✦A fresh set of professional ears: A pro with perspective might be able 
to hear things in your mix that need fixing. You might be so close to the
project that you have a hard time hearing your mix objectively.
Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
If you do decide to use a professional mastering engineer, the following tips
can help you choose one for your project:
✦Ask for referrals. If you know local bands or musicians whose music
you like and whose CDs sound great, ask them who mastered their
music. Call local studios and find out whom they recommend for master-
ing in your area. Also check out resources on the Internet. Two great
Internet forums are
www.forums.musicplayer.com
www.prosoundweb.com
In a forum, search for the term mastering or post a new topic and ask
your question. Try to get referrals from people who work with your 
type of music.
✦Listen to other recordings that the mastering house has done in a style
of music similar to yours. If you’re entrusting your artistic vision to
someone else, make sure that this person is the right person for the job.
If you like what the prospective mastering engineer has done on other
people’s music, you’ll probably like what he or she does with yours.
✦Clarify the fee for your project before you start working together.
Most mastering engineers charge by the hour and can give you a pretty
good estimate of how many hours they’ll need to do the job. You’ll also
be expected to pay for materials (reference CDs, for example).
Book VII
Chapter 1
Mastering Basics

Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
640
✦If you don’t like how an engineer masters your music, you’ll probably
be charged at the hourly rate to redo it. Some engineers will redo your
project for free, but don’t count on it. Be sure to discuss this possibility
before you start the project to avoid unwanted surprises.
Many mastering engineers will do a demo for you, tooling up one or two
songs so you can hear what kind of job they can do for your music before
you hire them. Ask whether the mastering engineer you’re interested in
offers this service. This simple step can save both you and the engineer a lot
of time and energy if he isn’t right for the job. It can also help you determine
whether your mixed music is ready for mastering. If you need to go back and
make adjustments, now’s the time to find out.
After you choose a mastering engineer who you think will work well for you
and your music, you can make the process much easier and less stressful
(for both you and the engineer) if you follow a few guidelines:
✦Discuss your expectations and desires. This is the best way to ensure
that your mastered music turns out how you want. People who are
unhappy with the job that a mastering engineer does usually aren’t clear
about what they want or don’t understand what is possible in the 
mastering process.
✦Take a few CDs whose sound you like with you to the mastering 
session. Talk with the engineer about how you can get your music to
sound similar. A skilled engineer can let you know right away whether
the sound you want is possible.
✦Try to be present at the mastering session. Many people send their
music to a mastering engineer and expect him to do the job without
their presence in the studio. Try to go to the studio. If you can’t, be sure
that the engineer clearly understands your desires and expectations.
If you’re in the studio during the mastering process and things aren’t going
how you want, talk with the engineer and try to get things on track again. 
If you’re finding that you’re unable to communicate with the engineer, stop
the session, have him burn a ref (reference copy), pay for the time you used,
and listen to the ref at home. If you don’t like what you hear at home, you
might be best off going somewhere else with your music.

Chapter 2: Mastering Your Music
In This Chapter
 Setting up a mastering session
 Converting your song files
 Processing your production
 Sequencing your songs
You’ve done everything else yourself, so why not master your music,
too? Well, I hear ya. Even though I’m a firm believer in the magic that 
a professional mastering engineer can bring to a production — check out
the preceding chapter in this mini-book for my take on that — I’m also a 
do-it-yourself kinda guy. If you’re like me, you at least need to give mastering
a shot. After all, you have nothing to lose — except a little time — and
everything to gain (or at least learn from).
This chapter walks you through how to master your music in Pro Tools. I
offer some general guidelines that you can keep in mind while you work and
help get you up to speed on mastering your music yourself. I also show you
how to set up your mastering session in Pro Tools.
The Pro Tools mastering steps given here use the Bounce to Disk function.
You don’t necessarily have to go this route. If you want, you can also send
your mastered tracks out to a digital device by following the steps in this
chapter — and then use the steps that describe mixing to an external 
digital device (found in Book VI, Chapter 7).
Considering General Guidelines
In other chapters, I present some specific techniques and settings to get 
you started. Unfortunately, I can’t do that when it comes to mastering
because there are just too many variables. That also means too many ways
to mess up your music when you’re trying to master it. What I can do (and
actually do) in the upcoming sections is walk you through the process of
mastering and show you the tools to use for each step. When you’re reading
these sections, keep the following in mind:

Setting Up a Mastering Session
642
✦Less is more when mastering. Do as little as possible to your music. 
All you really should need to do when you’re mastering is to optimize 
the dynamics and tonal balance of each song, get the levels between the
songs even, and sequence your songs. If you find yourself doing more —
having to make a lot of adjustments, for example — you might want to
go back to the mixing process and try again.
✦Mastering is all about compromise. Each adjustment you make to 
your mixed music affects all the instruments. If you use EQ to get rid of
muddiness on the bass guitar, you affect not only the bass guitar, but
also every other instrument in the mix.
✦Don’t try to master a song right after you mix it. Give yourself time and
space away from that song before you do anything else to it. In fact, I
recommend that you take a few days away from any of the songs on your
album between the mixing and mastering stages. A little time to reflect
and rest your ears can do wonders for your ability to hear what your
music needs.
✦You can really master music effectively only if your monitors and
monitoring environment are great. Without a good reference for how
your music sounds, trying to EQ or dynamically process your music
does no good. The music might sound good through your speakers but 
if they aren’t accurate, it probably doesn’t sound good through other
people’s speakers. Before you master, make your room sound as good as
you can and get to know the strengths and weaknesses of your monitor-
ing environment by listening to a ton of commercial CDs that have a
sound like the one you’re trying to get.
Setting Up a Mastering Session
The first step in mastering your music in Pro Tools is to set up a mastering
session. This involves creating a new Pro Tools session and importing the
mixed tracks from each song you want on your CD. This section of the chap-
ter details that process.
Start by creating a new session for mastering:
1. Choose File➪New Session from the main menu.
The New Session dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Type in the name of the file in the Save As field.
I usually call the file mastering and include the name of the CD project
that I’m working on.

Book VII
Chapter 2

3. In the Where field, choose the folder where you want to place the new
session.
I usually create a new folder called mastered mixes so it’s easy to find
the files later when I burn them to CD. (Book VIII, Chapter 1 has the
details on burning CDs.)
4. Choose the session parameters that match the mixed files for your
songs.
I’m talking audio file type, sample rate, I/O settings, and bit depth here.
Book II, Chapter 3 has more on the basics of setting up a new session.
5. Click Save.
Your new session opens.
The next step is to import your mixed songs into new tracks for this session:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Audio from the main menu.
The Import Audio dialog box opens.
Figure 2-1:

2. Using the Look In field, navigate through your folder structure to find
and select the song file you want to import.
3. Click Add.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for all the songs you want to master in this 
session.
5. Click Done.
A dialog box opens that allows you to choose whether the files enter a
new track or appear in the Regions list.
6. Choose the New Track option so that you audio files end up where
you can use them right away in your session.
7. Choose Session Start from the Location drop-down menu.
Each song you selected appears in a new track in your session. You can
also find them listed in the Audio Regions list.
You now have a session that contains all the songs for your project. Having
them all in one session allows you to switch from one song to the next while
you master your tunes and also makes it easy for you to check loudness
levels and EQ balancing while you work. (See the “Perfecting Tonal Balance”
and “Balancing Levels” sections, later in this chapter.)
Optimizing Dynamics
Okay, this is where the magic in mastering happens. This is where you can
make your music shine or where you can royally mess it up. (How’s that for
adding a little pressure?) Before you get tense (okay, breathe), remember
that you can always go back and try again. Oh, did I mention that you should
make backup copies of your individual tracks and your final mix? Well, if you
haven’t already done the backing-up business, now would be a good time to
do that. I’ll wait.
You done? Okay, now to the job at hand — getting your music to be as loud
as possible. (I’m just kidding; see the sidebar “Turn it up!” to see why.)
Seriously, optimizing the dynamics of your songs doesn’t mean getting it
loud enough to level a city block, but rather getting it to have life and emo-
tion. And, yes, this also means getting it to be loud enough to sound good.
The style of your music and the arrangements that you use determine how
you optimize the dynamics of your music. For example, classical music has 
a much broader dynamic range than rock music, and the infamous “wall of
sound” type of arrangement has a narrower dynamic range than a song 
with sparse verses and thicker choruses.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Mastering Your
Music
Optimizing Dynamics
645
When you’re optimizing the dynamics of your music, be sensitive to the song
and try not to get sucked into the idea that you need to get the most volume
out of your music. I know I’m beating this volume thing into the ground, but
you’d be surprised how seductive the lure of Big Volume can be. (“C’mon,
let’s get just a few more dBs out of the song . . .” Trust me; you’ll soon 
find out.)
You have two main types of tools to use when you work on the dynamics
during mastering in Pro Tools — compressor plug-ins and limiter plug-ins —
and each has its purpose. For the most part, if you’re trying to add punch or
smoothness to your music, using a compressor plug-in does the job nicely.
On the other hand, if you’re trying to squeeze a little more volume out of a
song and you don’t want to change the song’s sound quality, using a limiter
plug-in is your best choice.
Here are suggestions that might help you to use compression and limiting
most effectively during mastering:
✦Use a mild compression ratio (between 1.1:1 and 2:1) to keep from
overcompressing your music.
✦Apply only 1 or 2 decibels (dB) of compression or limiting at one time.
If you need more than that, chain more than one compressor together
by inserting more than one compressor plug-in in your track, and use
these small amounts on each. If you compress or limit more than 1 or
2dB at a time, you end up with artifacts (audible changes to your music
caused by the compressor or limiter).
✦Work with your attack and release times. An attack that’s too short
takes the punch out of your music by cutting off the initial transients.
Likewise, a release time that’s too long doesn’t recover quickly enough,
and the dynamics of the vocal disappear. In contrast, if the release time
is too short, you hear distortion.
✦Set the threshold so that your compressor’s meters dance (bounce) 
to the rhythm of the music. The meter you want to watch in your Pro
Tools Compressor plug-in is the one labeled Reduction, which is located
below the input and output meters. Only the loudest notes (snare drum
or lead vocal accents, for example) should trigger the meters — and
then only by 1 or 2dB.
✦Using a multiband compressor allows you to bring out individual
instruments in the mix. For example, if the bass drum seems to be 
getting lost, you can apply mild compression to the lower frequencies
(around 80–100 Hz). This brings the instrument forward in the mix
slightly.

Perfecting Tonal Balance
646
Pro Tools LE doesn’t come with a multiband compressor plug-in. If you
want to use one on your music, you need to get a third-party RTAS (Real
Time AudioSuite) plug-in. Check out the Digidesign User Conference
(DUC) at http://duc.digidesign.com for some options.
✦When you’re not sure whether what you’re doing sounds better, 
don’t use the processor. Any dynamics processing is going to affect the
quality of your song’s sound to some extent. If adding this processing
doesn’t improve the overall sound, you’re better off not using it.
You can find out more about compression and limiting in Book VI, Chapter 4.
When you’re testing compressor plug-in or limiter plug-in settings (by 
comparing the processed and unprocessed versions), be sure to have the
volume of both versions exactly the same. Any difference in volume defeats
the purpose of side-by-side comparison because people almost always
prefer the louder version regardless of whether it sounds better or not.
Perfecting Tonal Balance
Tonal balance of a song is how the various frequencies of the music relate to
one another. You’re not concerned with how each individual instrument
Turn it up!
Folks want their music to be as loud as possible.
Louder sounds better. In fact, test after test has
shown that when people listen to two versions
of a song, they nearly always prefer the louder
one (whether it actually sounds better or not).
Musicians, producers, and engineers seem to
be in the middle of a competition to see who can
make the loudest CD. If you compare a CD made
before 1995 or so with one made this year, you’ll
notice that the newer one is much louder. Give
them both a good listen, though. Does the louder
one really sound better?
You can test this by setting them both to play at
the same volume and then switching back and
forth. (You need to turn the volume up a bit on the
older CD to match the volume of the newer one.)
One way to do this is to record both songs into
Pro Tools and set the levels of each so that
they’re the same. At the same volume, which
song sounds better to you? I’m willing to bet that
nine out of ten times, you’ll prefer the older song
because older recordings have more dynamic
range than newer ones. The variety is pleasing
to listen to, whereas the song with only a small
dynamic range quickly becomes tiring.
Do yourself and your listeners a favor and resist
the temptation to compress the dynamic vari-
ability out of your music. It will be much easier
to listen to and have a lot more life and excite-
ment. You can always turn the volume up on
your stereo if it’s not loud enough, but you can’t
add dynamic range after you squashed it out.

sounds in the mix (that’s the job for the mixing stage); instead, what you’re
looking for is an overall balance of frequencies within the hearing spectrum.
For the most part, a tonal balance consists of an even distribution of fre-
quencies from 20–10 kHz with a slight drop-off (1 or 2dB) from 10–20 kHz or
higher. “That’s great,” you say, “but what does that sound like?” Well, listen
to any number of great CDs, and you’ll hear it.
When you master your music, you want to constantly compare what your
song sounds like against other CDs whose sound you like. In Book VI,
Chapter 1, I list a variety of excellent reference CDs for mixing. These CDs
work just as well for mastering, so check them out.
When you work on adjusting the overall tonal balance of your songs, listen
carefully for any frequencies that seem too loud or too soft. You can find
these by listening to particular instruments in the mix or by using the para-
metric EQ plug-in and sweeping the frequency spectrum. To do this, set 
your Q fairly wide (0.6, for instance) and move the Gain slider all the way the
right. Start with the lowest frequency and then slowly raise the frequency 
as the song plays by moving the Freq slider from left to right. Adjust any
annoying frequencies by cutting them by a couple of dBs to see whether
your overall mix improves.
As far as general EQ guidelines go, try these suggestions:
✦If your mix sounds muddy: Add high frequencies (higher than 10 kHz)
or cut low ones (200–400 Hz).
✦If your mix is too bright: This is common with digital recording. As a
remedy, try reducing the frequencies higher than 10 kHz by using a shelf
EQ or a Baxandall curve.
To use a Baxandall curve, use a parametric EQ and set the threshold at
20 kHz with a Q setting around 1. This gradually cuts frequencies above
around 10 kHz. You can adjust the Q to reach as far down as you want.
Your EQ graph shows you what’s happening.
Use the same EQ adjustments for both the right and left channels to
keep the stereo balance intact and not alter the relative phase between
the channels. For example, if you add some bass frequencies (100 Hz, for
example) to the one channel but not the other, you might hear a waver-
ing or a pulsating sound around this frequency go back and forth
between the speakers.
✦If you used a multiband compressor on any specific frequencies: You
might need to adjust the EQ for those frequencies; compression tends to
mess with frequency response.

Balancing Levels
648
Pro Tools LE doesn’t come with a multiband compressor plug-in. If 
you want to use one on your music, you need to get a third-party RTAS
plug-in for Pro Tools. Check out the Digidesign Users’ Conference (DUC)
at http://duc.digidesign.com for some options.
✦If you need to adjust the EQ of certain instruments in the mix:
Suppose that the snare drum is buried. Be careful and notice the overall
effect of your adjustments on the rest of the mix. If your adjustments
aren’t fixing the problem, go back to the mixing process and make your
adjustments there. You’ll be glad you took the time to do that.
Any adjustments you make to the EQ during mastering affect more 
than just those frequencies. Such adjustments alter the entire frequency
spectrum — and the relationship between all the instruments. So listen
carefully while you make adjustments and back off on the additional EQ
if you don’t like what you hear.
For more specific information on EQ and inserting EQ in your tracks, go to
Book VI, Chapter 3.
Some people check the tonal balance of their songs against that of their
favorite CDs. You do this by recording a song into your mastering program
and taking a look at its frequency response by using a spectral analyzer. 
Pro Tools doesn’t come with a spectral analyzer, but you can buy one as a
third-party plug-in. Just look for an RTAS version to ensure that it works with
Pro Tools. Then do an analysis of your song and compare it with the spectral
analysis of a CD you like. This technique seems to work for many people
(albeit, not me, because I like using my ears instead; alas, I’m old-fashioned).
Balancing Levels
For a truly professional-sounding CD, you want all your songs to be at nearly
the same relative level so your listeners (I hope you have more than one)
don’t have to adjust the volume on their stereos from song to song.
Balancing the levels of your songs to one another is pretty easy. In fact, in
most cases, you have very little to do after you EQ and optimize the dynam-
ics of each song. You balance the levels from one song to the next in Pro
Tools by putting each track’s fader up to 0dB — putting them at the level
you mixed them — and then soloing Track 1 and comparing the level with
Track 2 by soloing back and forth.
If you use a mouse to mix, this can be kinda tricky because you can’t press
more than one button at a time. The best way I’ve found to deal with this 
situation is to follow these steps:
1. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Solo button to solo
the track.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Mastering Your
Music
Mastering Your Mix
649
You hear only Track 1 in your monitors.
2. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Mute button so that
both the Solo and Mute buttons for Track 1 are engaged.
Track 1 is silent.
3. In the Track Controls section of Track 2, quickly click the Solo button.
You now hear Track 2.
4. To switch back to hearing Track 1, click the Track 2 Solo button (dis-
engage it). Then, as quickly as possible, click the Track 1 Mute button
(disengaging the Mute button and engaging the Solo button).
You hear Track 1 again.
You get a short bit of silence when following this procedure, but you can still
be able to hear the relative volumes of the two.
Do this procedure for each of the tracks (Track 1 to Track 2, Track 2 to Track
3, and so on) until you check all the tracks in your mastering session.
If you miss one of the buttons while you’re doing this quick-switch proce-
dure, you might end up with both tracks playing at the same time. This 
will be very loud because the tracks are summed in the mix bus. To avoid
damaging your speakers — or ears — keep your monitoring (speaker)
volume down pretty low.
If you notice any differences, just raise (or better yet, lower) the levels until
they are all roughly the same. Don’t get too finicky. Some variation from song
to song is okay. In fact, minor differences can help to make your CD more
interesting to listen to. When you’re balancing levels, just make sure that any
differences aren’t enough to make the listener run to his or her stereo or
snatch up the remote to adjust the volume. If one or two songs seem much
lower in volume than the rest, consider going back to the volume-optimizing
stage and raising those songs a bit to make them more consistent with the
rest of the songs on the CD. That way, you don’t lower the volume of the
entire CD because one or two songs are too quiet.
Mastering Your Mix
After you have all your songs dynamically optimized, EQed, and level-
balanced (see the previous sections of this chapter), you’re ready to record
your final master. This process is essentially the same as making your final
mix, so check out Book VI, Chapter 7 for the steps to do this. You need to do
one more thing when mastering, however, which involves getting your songs
to the CD format.

Mastering Your Mix
650
Most likely, your session’s songs are recorded at 24 bits, using any number
of possible sample rates (44.1, 48, 88.2, or 96 kHz), but your final master
should be 16-bit at 44.1 kHz (this is the CD standard; anything else won’t
record as an audio CD and play in your CD player). Making this change can
reduce the sound quality of your music if it’s not done right. The following
sections detail how to change the sample rate and bit depth as you create 
a final master version of your music.
Making the most of your bits
Getting your music from 24-bit to 16-bit means either dithering or truncating
your files. The following sections explain how these processes differ, giving
you pointers on which one to use so your music sounds as good as possible.
Dithering
Dithering adds random noise to your music when 8 bits get cut from your
pristine 24-bit files. This random noise helps keep the quiet sections of your
song (fades-outs, for instance) from sounding grainy when those 8 bits are
removed. Several types of dithering are available, each of which produces 
a slightly different result in a piece of music.
Pro Tools comes with two dithering plug-ins: Dither and POWr Dither. Each
plug-in has different noise-shaping options, which use filters to move the
random noise to inaudible frequencies. I’m confident that you’ll find at least
one of them works well for your music. Figure 2-2 shows these plug-ins.
To dither a song, simply insert one of the two dithering plug-ins into one of
the inserts in your master fader, and then follow the steps (as detailed in
Book VI, Chapter 7) for mixing your music. The dithering happens 
automatically while your song is mixed — or, in this case, mastered.

Truncation
Truncation simply cuts off the last 8 bits of information. This option works
well for material that doesn’t have quiet sections: for example, hard rock
with punchy endings that don’t fade out.
To master your music using truncation, follow the steps in Book VI, Chapter 7
for mixing your song and then choose 16-bit as your Bounce to Disk resolu-
tion — or use one of the digital outputs to send your signal out of Pro Tools.
Either technique cuts off the last 8 bits without otherwise processing the
signal. This is the difference from dithering.
To dither or not to dither (and which dithering option to use)? Those are the
questions for which no universal answer exists. The only way to know which
sounds better on your music is to try each of them. For the most part, songs
with quiet passages and fade-outs often sound better if you dither ’em.
Mastering to 16 bits
When you master — regardless of whether you using the dithering 
approach — make sure you select the 16-bit option under the Resolution
drop-down menu (located in the Bounce dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3).
If you have a dithering plug-in inserted into your Master fader, your music 
is dithered while it’s being bounced; if you don’t use a dithering plug-in, 
your music is truncated.

652
Settling on a sample rate
If you recorded at any sample rate other than 44.1 kHz, you need to do a
sample-rate conversion (SRC) process. SRC can change the sound of your
song (and not for the better). Your best bet when bouncing from one sample
rate to another is to set the conversion quality as high as possible. The 
following steps show how:
1. Choose Setup➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Processing tab of the Preferences dialog box.
3. From the Conversion Quality drop-down menu, under the Import 
section located at the right side of the Processing tab (as shown in
Figure 2-4), choose TweakHead if you want the highest quality 
possible.
It takes a while to process (go get a cup of coffee or read your favorite
gear magazine while you wait), but I think it’s worth it.
You have several options for sample-rate conversion quality. Don’t take 
my anal-retentive word for which works best for your music. Do some exper-
imenting on your own. One of the lower-quality conversion settings might
work just fine — and, you won’t have to wait so long while your song is being
processed.

Sequencing Your Songs
653
When you actually bounce your song to disk, you need to choose 44.1 kHz
from the Sample Rate drop-down menu located in the center of the Bounce
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Sequencing Your Songs
Sequencing your songs is choosing the order of the songs on the CD as 
well as the amount of silence between songs. Chances are that when you
recorded your songs, you had an idea about the order in which you wanted
them to appear on your final CD. If you don’t know how you want to arrange
your songs, here are some things to consider:
✦Consider each song’s tempo in the sequencing equation. Some CDs
work well if songs with a similar tempo are grouped together, and others
work best when contrasting songs follow one another.
✦Think about a song’s lyrics and how they relate to the lyrics from the
other songs on your CD. If you want to tell your listener a story, 
consider how the order of the songs can best tell that story.
✦Think about the chords that you used in each song and how they
relate to another song you might want to place before or after it in 
the sequence. The ending chord of one song might conflict with the
beginning chord of another — or lead right in.
Figure 2-5:

Rate drop-

dialog box.

Sequencing Your Songs
654
For most of us, sequencing has more to do with the actual process of placing
each song in its proper place on the CD than with trying to decide where
that proper place might actually be.
Most of the sequencing process involves deciding how much time to place
between the songs on your CD. No set amount of time has to be placed
between songs. Choose what seems right for the two songs you’re working
with. Sometimes you might want just a second or two; other times, four or
five seconds is more appropriate. For example, if you have a mellow ballad
followed by an upbeat song, you might want to leave a little more time
between these two songs so that the listener is prepared for the faster song.
Try leaving a space that lasts about four to six beats at the slower song’s
tempo, for instance. On the other hand, if you want two tunes to flow
together, you can leave less time between them. Use your ears, thinking
about how you want your listener to respond when the music moves from
one song to another.
You don’t sequence your songs in Pro Tools; instead, this is done within 
the CD-burning program you use. After you bounce your mastered tracks in
Pro Tools to 16-bit files with a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, you can then import
them into your CD-burning software and arrange them how you want. This
includes arranging the order of the songs and setting the amount of silence
between songs. Check out your CD-burning program for specifics on how 
it handles these operations.

O
ne of the coolest things about audio recording nowadays is that you
can create music in your home and put it on the same medium that
the biggest record companies use. When I started as a recording engineer,
the best you could do was put your music on cassette for other people to
listen to. Pressing vinyl was expensive. But now anyone with a computer, 
a CD burner, and a few inexpensive CD-Rs can put his or her music on the
same format as all the best albums in the record store. You gotta love it!
In this chapter, you explore how to make CDs of your music. You discover
the best CD-Rs to buy, and you get a chance to burn a CD. You also find out
how to submit your mastered CD to a company that can mass-produce your
music and make it ready to sell. All that’s left are some ideas for promoting
your packaged product, which you can find in this chapter as well.
Getting into CD Burning
Because you’re recording in your computer with Pro Tools, chances are you
have a computer with a CD-R or CR-RW drive. If so, you also have software
that you can use to burn your CDs. Most CD-burning software works fine for
putting your mastered music onto CDs. If you don’t already have a burner
and want to add one to your existing computer, check the system require-
ments for the burner that interests you to make sure that your system can
use it. For audio CDs, you can use just about any CD burner on the market
(as long as it’s compatible with your system, of course).

Purchasing CD-Rs
658
Purchasing CD-Rs
A staggering variety of CD-R types are available. Available are green, blue,
gold, and even black CDs; as well as data and music CDs. So which ones are
best? Well, that depends.
Unless you have a consumer CD recorder from several years ago, you can
record your CD onto any data CD-R. You can find these discs just about 
anywhere, and they can cost as little as five to ten cents apiece if you buy 
in quantity. If you have an older consumer CD recorder, you have to use
music CD-Rs. These CD-Rs have a code in them that allows older consumer
recorders to actually record. These CD-Rs cost a lot more not because they
capture music any better, but because a royalty — about one dollar, which
goes to the recording industry — is figured into the price of the CD. (Don’t
get me started.)
So, if you have a late-model CD-R recorder connected to your computer, or 
if you have a professional-grade CD burner (such as the Alesis Masterlink),
you can get by just fine by using run-of-the-mill data CD-Rs.
As far as which of the countless CD-R brands to use, well, they’re all pretty
much the same as long as you go with a major manufacturer. Personally, I
always go with Taiyo Yuden if I can find them. (Do a search on the Internet
for some places that sell this brand.) Keep in mind, though, that some CD-Rs
work better on some recorders, and the only way to find out is to try them
and see. When you find a brand that works, try to stick with it.
Look for CD-Rs with a tough top surface. It’s the scratches or pits in the top
of the disc that cause it not to play over time, not the scratches or pits on
the bottom.
Recording Your Music to CD-R
Burning a CD is easy. All you generally have to do is open your CD-burning
software and follow the prompts. A few things, however, can be helpful to
know to get the best sound and to create a CD that you can duplicate.
Dealing with diversity: Using different CD recorders
If you’re using a CD burner in your computer, burning a CD is as simple as
opening your software and following the program’s directions for making a
CD. If you use a standalone CD recorder (burner), you have to connect it to
your Digidesign interface (via a digital connection) and record to your CD
recorder. These options are presented in the following subsections.

Computer-based systems
If you have a CD burner program (such as Toast, Jam, or CD Creator), burn-
ing your CD is easy. One advantage of using one of these programs to burn 
a CD is that you have quite a bit of flexibility to organize your songs and
place space between them.
In general, all you have to do is click the Add Track button on the main
screen and select the track you want to add. You’re also prompted to choose
any silence that you want to place before the track, as well as PQ subcode
information. (A PQ subcode is “housekeeping” information added to the CD
data; it includes instructions for start and stop times for each track.)
When you have all your tracks assembled, you can go ahead and burn your
CD. Pretty simple, huh?
Standalone CD burners
A variety of standalone CD burners are available, and they all work differ-
ently. Some record the CD the same way a cassette player records tapes: 
You connect the digital input of the CD recorder to the digital output of your
Digidesign interface and then press Record on the CD recorder while clicking
Play in Pro Tools. The CD is then recorded in real time. Other standalone 
CD burners, such as an Alesis Masterlink (the CD-burning standard for many
pro studios), work more like computer software programs than cassette
recorders.
With the Masterlink, you first record the music from Pro Tools to the
Masterlink hard drive (using the same procedures just listed). From there,
you can edit, sequence, and even dynamically process each song before 
you burn all the songs to a CD-R. When you’re happy with the order of the
songs and the spacing between them, you can then burn your CD.
Recognizing Red Book CDs
Regardless of the CD burner you get, make sure
that it can create a Red Book CD. I know that this
sounds mysterious, but all Red Book means is
that the CD is an audio CD, not a CD-ROM. Red
Book is a standard for the data used to create an
audio CD; a Red Book–capable burner follows
that standard. This ensures that your CD can
play on all audio CD players. Your CD burner
clearly states whether it can burn audio, or Red
Book, CDs.

Recording Your Music to CD-R
660
If you want to do any dynamic processing to your music in the Masterlink,
be sure to send your files to the machine undithered and at 24 bit. You can
dither in the Masterlink after you make your changes. This improves the
sound of your final CD. If all you’re doing is sequencing your songs, you can
send the files dithered if you want. (For more on dithering, see Book VII,
Chapter 2.)
Burning for mass production
If you intend to send your CD-R to a duplication or replication company to
have it mass produced, you have a few ducks to get in a row first. Here are 
a few things to keep in mind:
✦Check for physical defects to the CD-R before you try to burn to it.
Scratches, fingerprints, smudges, and other imperfections on the mirror
side (bottom) of the CD-R can cause errors in the data when burning 
the CD-R. Be sure to use a clean and unblemished CD-R for burning your
master. After all, CD-Rs are cheap.
✦Always write your master CD by using Disc at Once mode. This allows
the CD to be read as a Red Book audio CD. Your other option when
recording a CD is Track at Once, which burns one song (track) at a time.
Unfortunately, Track at Once produces more errors than Disc at Once,
which burns the entire CD at one time. Because of the errors present 
on CDs burned when using Track at Once, a mass producer’s equipment
can’t read — and therefore summarily rejects — CDs that people pro-
duce via this method. (In fact, many older CD players for homes and
cars can’t read these CDs, either.) So be sure that you use Disc at Once
whenever you make a CD of your mastered music.
✦If you can, use an error-detection software program to check for
errors in your recorded CD or verify your disc when you burn it.
(This is an option you can generally choose within your CD burning soft-
ware check your burner’s manual for details.) If you don’t have access to
an error-detection program, put your CD into an audio CD player and
listen all the way through, making sure it doesn’t skip or stop. Also
check the back of the CD for any blemishes (just like you did before
recording onto it).
✦Listen carefully to your entire CD after it’s recorded. Compare it 
with your original file and make sure that the CD is perfect. Also, spend
time reevaluating the order of the songs. Make sure that they flow well
together (Book VII, Chapter 2 has more on sequencing your songs).
✦Label the CD master. With a felt-tip marker approved for use on CD-Rs,
write the name of your album and all your contact info. Your contact
information should include your name (or your band’s name), your
phone number, and the date when the master was made.

Book VIII
Chapter 1

on CD
Recording Your Music to CD-R
661
If the marker isn’t specifically labeled as such, the ink might leak
through the top surface of the disc over time, disrupting the data.
And don’t use a ballpoint pen or an adhesive label (paper or plastic) to
identify your master. A ballpoint pen can damage the surface of the CD.
Adhesive labels can slow the rotation speed of the CD (causing errors in
the duplication or replication process), and they’ve been known to come
off inside a duplication machine, clogging up the works.
Write only on the top surface of the disc.
✦Make three CD-Rs of your mastered music. Keep one copy safe in your
studio and send the other two to the duplication or replication com-
pany. Call it good insurance: If one of the two CDs that you send off for
mass production has an error, you don’t waste any time sending the
company a replacement.
✦Prepare a PQ subcode log. PQ subcodes include additional information,
written on the CD, that provides time-code information, such as track
numbers and the start and stop times of the tracks. If your CD burner
software doesn’t support PQ subcodes, make a list of the start and stop
time of each track (referenced from the start of the CD) on a separate
piece of paper as well as the track number and length of each track; then
send that info along with your CD masters. If your software program can
generate a PQ subcode log, print it — and remember to send it with your
CD master.
If you’re burning a CD for a major record label, first of all, congratulations!
Secondly, make sure you supply ISRC (International Standard Recording
Code) codes with your CD. These codes contain information about the CD,
such as the owner of the song, the country of origin, year of release, and
serial number. (You can find more information and an application for 
obtaining ISRC codes for your music at: www.riaa.com/whatwedo.
php?content_selector=whatwedo_isrc_codes.) You enter ISRC codes
into a dialog box on most CD-burning programs, and the information is
placed within the PQ subcodes.
Before you put your music out into the world, get it copyrighted. Getting 
a copyright on your music is easy and relatively inexpensive, so there’s no
reason not to do it. And it will protect you if there is ever a dispute about
who wrote your music.
All you have to do is fill out an SR (sound recording) form and send it 
into the U.S. Copyright Office at the Library of Congress. You can find the
form at www.copyright.gov/forms, or you can call the Copyright Office
at 202-707-9100 to have it mailed to you. Choose (or ask for) Form SR with
Instructions. The current cost for filing the form is $45, but double-check
this fee before you send it in because it’s been known to go up. (Hey, it’s the

Making Multiple Copies
662
government.) You can fill out one form for each CD, so the cost per song isn’t
very high. After you have your copyright, it’s yours for life.
The form is pretty easy to fill out, but if you run into difficulty, you can call
an information specialist to help you out. The number is 202-707-3000. Be
prepared to wait on hold for a little while. (Hey, it’s the government.)
Send your completed form, the fee, and a copy of your CD to the address
listed on the form. You’ll receive a certificate in the mail, but you can con-
sider your music copyrighted as soon as you mail it in (as long as you sent 
it to the correct address). If you’re especially protective of your music 
(paranoid? or is that paranoid enough?), you can wait until your check clears
your bank. At this point, you can be almost certain that your form is being
processed. If you can’t sleep at night unless your music is copyrighted,
you’re best off waiting until your certificate arrives in the mail before you
start selling or distributing your CD. (This is a good reason to file for your
copyright early.)
Making Multiple Copies
When you have a CD that you want to copy, you can either make the copies
yourself or hire someone to copy them for you. If you copy them yourself,
you have to burn CDs one at a time, just like the first one. This can cost very
little but take a lot of time (as you undoubtedly found out when you burned
your first CD).
Making copies yourself
Well, you’ve done everything else yourself, so why not add the copying
process to the list? If you have more time than money and only need a few
CDs, making them yourself might be a good option.
To make saleable CDs yourself, you need not only the CD burner, but also a
graphics design software program and a printer to print CD labels and cover
material (CD sleeve and tray card). Even with this equipment, your package
won’t look as professional as the package that a CD duplication or replica-
tion company can create, but what you create is probably good enough for
you to sell a few copies to friends, acquaintances, and maybe open-mic-night
audiences.
Having someone else making copies
Depending on how many copies you want, you can either have them 
duplicated or replicated. Either process can provide you with a professional-
quality product that you can sell alongside major releases. Your choice
between duplication and replication depends on how many copies you plan
to have made.

Duplication
Duplication involves making copies of your master CD-R the same way 
you made the CD-R in the first place. The only difference is that duplication
companies use CD burners that enable them to make more than one copy at 
a time. Duplication is great if you want to make a small number of copies —
anywhere from 50 to 300. Most CD-duplication companies include the actual
discs (with printing on them), jewel cases with color-printed inserts, bar
codes (see the “UPC bar codes” sidebar in this chapter), and shrink-wrap.
You can expect to pay around $3 to $5 for each CD, depending on the quantity
you order. You can also find other types of packaging, such as vinyl sleeves
and one-color printing, for less per disc if $3 to $5 is too steep for you.
An advantage to having your CDs duplicated is that your CDs usually can be
done quickly. Many duplication companies can provide you with a finished
product in as little as a few days (although an average of seven days seems
more common). The disadvantage is that you usually pay considerably more
for each CD than you would if you did it yourself or went the replication
route.
To have your CDs duplicated, you need to provide a CD-R master — that is, 
a CD-R recorded as a Red Book–compliant audio CD. If you want the duplica-
tion company to create retail-ready packages, you also have to provide art-
work laid out to the company’s specifications. (Hint: Get ’em beforehand.)
If you’re interested in going the duplication route, here are a few resources
to get you started. You can also do a search on the Internet for more places
by using the search term CD duplication.

A work of art
Cover artwork is an important part of your CD.
Take the time to create a visually appealing CD
cover and tray card. This is especially true if you
intend to sell your CD through record stores or
other retailers. Your package needs to look pro-
fessional because it’s going to be competing
with the big boys (and girls) who have huge art
budgets for their CDs.
If you can’t create a professional package your-
self (no shame there — not everybody can), hire
someone to do it. Most CD replicators I discuss in
this chapter provide design services. Sometimes
these services are even included in the CD pack-
age price. I recommend that you take advantage
of these services; sometimes you get best results
by letting the pros do what they do.

Most of the companies that I list in the following section also provide dupli-
cation services for smaller quantities.
Replication
Replication is the process used for making commercial CDs — lots and lots
of them. Instead of making copies directly from your master CD-R, this
process involves burning a glass master — the master disc from which all
your CD copies will be made — from your master disc. The glass master is
then used to transfer the data onto CD media. Replication is designed for
larger runs: namely, 500 or more copies. Quantities of fewer than 300 aren’t
cost effective because the glass master often costs between $100 and $200 to
make, and the film needed for the printing of the CD and sleeve and tray card
can cost several hundred more.
CD replication usually comes with printing on the CD in one to four colors,
and a tray card and sleeve often printed in four colors. Most CD-replication
companies have retail-ready CD package deals that cover everything from
layout of your artwork (some do, some don’t, so be sure to ask first), printed
CDs, jewel boxes, bar codes (see the “UPC bar codes” sidebar in this chap-
ter), and shrink wrap. You can expect to pay between $1,000 and $1,500 for
500–1,000 retail-ready copies from most manufacturers.
If you’re interested in going the replication route, you need to provide the
replication company with a master audio CD, artwork set to its specifica-
tions, and a completed order form. Oh, and you’ll probably have to pay half
the money for the job up front before they start work on your project
(bummer).
After people at the manufacturing company receive your order form, the CD,
and the artwork, they make a reference CD (which shows you what the fin-
ished product will sound like) and proofs of your finished printed material.
Be sure to look over the art proofs carefully: Listen to every second of the
reference CD. Any mistakes you don’t catch are your problem, so take your
time and compare the reference CD very closely with the master recording.
(You did make a copy of your master CD before you sent it out, right?) The
master and the reference should be exactly the same.

Having your CD replicated is a stressful thing. You’re spending a ton of
money and getting quite a few copies; you’ll need to be proud enough of
them to go out in the world and sell them. Choosing a CD-replication com-
pany to work with is an important task. Quite a few companies are out there,
so you should choose the place that makes you feel the most comfortable
and makes a high-quality product.

UPC bar codes
If you make a CD that you intend to sell through
major retailers, such as record stores or Internet
retailers, you need a UPC bar code. A UPC bar
code is a string of numbers that identify your
product. Every CD has its own unique bar code.
You can go about a getting a bar code in one of
two ways: You can register and pay $750 with
the Universal Code Council (UCC), or you can
pay anywhere from nothing to $50 to get one
from a CD replicator or distributor.
Unless you intend to release more than 35 
CDs, your best bet is to buy a bar code from a
replicator or distributor, who can provide bar
codes for a small (or no) fee with your CD order.
Here are additional places where you can get a

Promoting Your Music
666
Many CD-replication companies can provide you with great resources, infor-
mation, and even opportunities for promoting your work. Take advantage 
of these opportunities if you can, but don’t choose a company based on its 
promotional promises. Choose a company because of its customer service,
price, and the quality of its product.
Be sure to ask for referrals (or at least a list of satisfied clients) before you
go with a duplication or replication company. As always, your best bet when
you’re entrusting someone with your precious music to is to ask friends for
recommendations. Also, take timing estimates with a grain of salt. I’ve had a
couple of occasions when a company promised to finish my CDs by a certain
date, and the discs didn’t show up. So, leave plenty of time between when
you print your CDs and when you need them.
Promoting Your Music
Congratulations, you have a CD to sell. The hard — oops, I’m sorry, actually
the easy — part is behind you. I’m sure you don’t want to be stuck with boxes
of expensive coasters, so now you have to work on getting people interested
in buying your music. You’ve just gone from being a musician-composer-
engineer-producer to being all those plus a record company-owner-business-
person. (Exactly how hyphenated can a person get, anyway?)
Your friends and some acquaintances will probably buy a few copies, but
after you’ve sold a CD to all of them, you need to get your music to the
broader world. This can be tricky. After all, you’re now competing with the
big boys, and face it: You don’t have nearly the resources that they do.
Traditional channels of distribution and marketing are pretty much out of
the question for you (and for most of us). So, to succeed in selling your
music, you need to try some alternative approaches.
I’m no marketing guru, but I have managed to create a nice niche for myself
and my music. So, trust me; you can do the same. All it takes is a little imagi-
nation and a lot of hard work. In the following list, I present a few ideas that
have worked for me and other enterprising, independent artists:
✦Take yourself seriously. No, don’t go buy a limo. At least not yet. 
What I mean here is to take the job of promoting and selling your music
seriously: Treat it as a business. Getting people to notice and buy your
music is a lot of work, but it doesn’t have to be a drag. (If it is, you’re
better off getting someone else to do it for you.)
✦Get organized. Get your new business off on the right foot by 
developing a habit of keeping track of your sales and developing a con-
tact list. One of the best investments that you can make is to get a 

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Putting Your Music

667
contact-management database (ACT! is a good one) to keep track of 
promotion contacts (newspapers, radio stations, clubs), CD sales, and
fans. Also, do yourself a big favor and keep meticulous records of 
your income and expenses; you’ll be grateful you did that when tax 
time comes.
✦Create a mailing list. This is one of the most cost-effective and powerful
ways that you can start to develop a following. Make a sign-up sheet 
for your mailing list available at every public appearance. (Ask people to
include both their postal mail address and e-mail address.) Then enter
those names into your database system. You can then either send out
snail-mailings or e-mail notices whenever you play or do anything worth
mentioning.
✦Get out and be seen. This one is pretty straightforward. Get out in the
world and let people know about your music. This can mean not only
playing gigs but also talking about your music. I have a good friend who
releases an album each year. He prints 1,000 copies, which he sells at 
his gigs, and every year he sells out. (Hey, that’s an extra $10,000 a year
after expenses. Not bad!) He also uses the CDs as his calling card in
order to get more gigs.
✦Look beyond the record store. Competing with the major labels in the
record store is nearly impossible. Unless you live in a small town or
know of a record shop that has a section devoted to local bands, ready
and willing to sell your CDs, you need to think of other places to put
your music. For example, another friend of mine has placed his CD at
quite a few of the local businesses in his neighborhood around the holi-
days. Every place — from the local pack-and-ship to the video store —
has a counter-top display with his CD. He creates a small poster that fits
on the counter, describing him and his music. He sells quite a few CDs
and gets a handful more gigs each year this way.
✦Capitalize on your style. Some nonrecord-store venues just happen to
fit what your music is saying. For example, another one of my friends
composes folksy, new-age music, and he managed to get his CDs into a
handful of new-age, gift-type shops. He often puts them in the stores on
consignment and checks each store once weekly to refill the counter-top
display and collect any money that the store took in (minus the store’s
cut, of course). Going into the stores every week helps him to develop 
a connection with the store owners, many of whom have arranged for
him to do performances in their stores, which increases his exposure
and sales.
✦Try something different. Years ago, I teamed up with a local author and
played at her book signings. (This is before I wrote any books myself.)
She read a passage from her book, and then I played for a few minutes. 
I always ended up selling a few dozen CDs at these events.

Promoting Your Music
668
✦Don’t be stingy. Give away your CD (within reason, of course). I usually
count on giving away anywhere from 10–15 percent of the CDs I print.
These can be for reviews, as a way to get gigs, or for any way to spread
the word about the music. Giving out your CD as a promotional tool is
an inexpensive way to let people know what you’re doing.
Some of the bigger CD replication companies, such as Oasis and Disc
Makers, offer independent artists (this would be you) promotional opportu-
nities that can get you more distribution and exposure. I recommend looking
at these distribution and promotion options when you consider a company
to manufacture your CD. These opportunities can save you a lot of time and
money, and they’re often included in the replication price.
If you’re interested in the possibilities for using the Internet to promote and
sell your music, I discuss these in Chapter 2 of this mini-book.
I’m sure there are dozens more ways to promote and sell your music. Think
outside the box and use your imagination. Remember: Don’t be shy. Do
whatever you can to get your music out into the world.

T
o make it as a musician, you have to get the word out that you and 
your music exist. Traditionally, you played gigs, sold your CDs at these
gigs, and tried to get your music in local stores and on local radio. If you
were lucky, you’d sell a few CDs at each gig, move a handful of others
through local outlets, and maybe get some radio play on a college station.
Forget getting any national exposure unless you had developed a following
and had a busy touring schedule.
That’s the way it used to play, but now the Internet makes it possible for any
musician to get national — even international — exposure without going on
the road (as much). All you have to do is get your music on the Internet and
promote it well. You can then make money from your music while you sleep
(or at least make your music available while you sleep).
So how do you do this? Well, that’s the purpose of this chapter. Here, you

Understanding MP3
670
Understanding MP3
I’m sure you’ve heard about MP3s. In fact, I’m willing to bet that you’ve
already downloaded a few MP3s off the Internet and experienced first-hand
the immediacy that MP3s offer. You go to a Web site and choose a song to
download. After just a short while, you have a copy on your hard drive that
you can listen to anytime you want. You can even put that song on a CD or
portable player and take it with you.
With all this convenience and immediacy comes a downside. That MP3 song
doesn’t sound as good as one mastered to a CD. For most people, this is a
small price to pay for the ability to download a song for free (well, okay,
often for a buck a shot these days). After all, most people play their music
on less-then-stellar-sounding stereos. (Can you say iPod?) But if you’re one
of the lucky few with a stellar (or more-than-stellar) stereo system, you’re
going to hear the difference, which prompts the following question: Why
doesn’t a song in MP3 format sound as good as one mastered to a CD? The
answer: data compression.
MP3 is a process that compresses your music so that it takes up less hard
drive space. Data compression is necessary, or MP3s couldn’t work over 
the Internet. Consider the numbers: A regular CD music file can take 30MB to
40MB (about 10MB per minute). That same song can take only 3MB to 4MB
in MP3 format. This is important because promoting music on the Internet 
is totally dependent upon speed. A 30MB or 40MB file is way too big to
What do you mean by near-CD quality?
You might have heard the term near-CD quality
used in reference to MP3 sound. This “market-
ing” term means that it doesn’t sound as good as
a CD, but it sounds pretty darn close and maybe
the buyer won’t notice. If you sense a note of
cynicism in my writing, you’re right. Don’t delude
yourself into believing that the song you start
with is going to sound quite the same after MP3
conversion.
The difference between a song on a CD and 
a song that’s near-CD quality is like the differ-
ence between playing a CD in your car and then
hearing the same song on the radio. You lose
some high end, and the bass is thinner. You might
even lose the stereo image, depending on the
conversion mode you choose, and you’ll proba-
bly lose some dynamic range. Overall, the song
will have a little less life to it.
Although not a huge difference for most people,
the difference is noticeable, nonetheless. The
good news is that most people don’t seem to
care (or are at least willing to accept it) — and
that the song is now slim enough to zip through
the Internet to potential customers.

download or to stream on the Web (even for people with broadband Internet
connections). For example, dial-up users using a 56 Kbps modem have to
wait more than two hours to download a 40MB file! I don’t know about you,
but I don’t know anyone who is willing to wait that long to hear a piece of
music. And if you haven’t heard it before and aren’t yet sure you like it? You
get the idea.
Although compression causes your MP3 to lose fidelity as well as
megabytes, I think this loss of quality is an actual advantage. After all, it’s
normal that your MP3 won’t sound as good as your mastered CD in its 
multimeg brilliance. It doesn’t have to; you’re giving listeners just a taste 
of your music. By giving people this taste, along with the opportunity to 
purchase a CD, you help them to decide whether they want to buy the 
high-quality version.
Engine
When you convert a song on your mastered CD to an MP3, the engine is 
the encoding algorithm (technical term for a number cruncher) that is used
to convert your file. Not all engines make your song sound the same. Some
engines give your song a much better online sound than others, and you
may get a better quality sound from an engine if you adjust the bit rate
and/or the recording mode. Some MP3 encoders allow you to choose the
engine you want to use (as shown in Figure 2-1); others don’t.
Figure 2-1:
MP3

variety of
engines to

Understanding MP3
672
The standard (and arguably best) encoding engine is the Franhofer algo-
rithm although LAME is gaining in popularity (maybe in spite of its name).
The encoding engine that you choose affects the results you get. Try a few 
to decide what works best for your music and your situation.
Bit rate
Bit rate essentially determines the quality of your encoded music. When you
encode your music, you have to choose what bit rate you want your file to
be in, as shown in Figure 2-2. Bit rates range anywhere from 20 kilobaud per
second (kBdps) to 320 kBdps. The higher the bit rate, the better the sound
quality. The downside is that higher bit rates create larger files. When you
convert your music to MP3, you’re constantly balancing quality with file size.
The bit rate that you ultimately choose depends on how you plan to use
your MP3 file. For example, if you want to put your music on an MP3 host 
site (an Internet site that makes people’s MP3 music available for download),
you most likely need to choose the 128 kBdps rate because this is what
many host sites require for Download or Hi-Fi mode. On the other hand, if
you want to stream audio on the Web (a process that plays the track while
it’s downloading), you’re better off choosing a much lower rate (between 32
and 48 kBdps). Otherwise, your song will pause abruptly while it’s playing —
at least for those people who still use a dial-up modem.

Understanding MP3

Variable bit rate (VBR) is an option that many encoders offer. VBR allows the
encoder to change the bit rate while it compresses the file. The advantage to
this approach is that the sections with fewer instruments — in effect, less
data — can be compressed further than sections full of more critical informa-
tion. The result is often a better sounding MP3 that takes up less space. The
only drawback — and it’s a big one — is that few MP3 players can read a file
created with VBR. So, you’re probably best off not using this approach for
your Web-based files.
If you’re making MP3s to listen to through your own player and it supports
VBR playback, using VBR keeps your files smaller. If you do choose VBR,
you’re prompted to choose an average bit rate or a minimum and maximum
bit rate. Try them both and choose the one that sounds best to you.
Mode
Modes essentially refer to whether your file is in stereo or mono, only your
choices include more than just plain stereo and mono. You can choose mono,
stereo, joint stereo, or (sometimes) forced stereo (also known as dual mono),
as shown in Figure 2-3. Again, you choose the mode according to what your
music needs to sound its best, and you balance quality against file size.
Here’s a look at the various modes and how they relate to quality and 
file size:
✦Mono: Mono takes up little room because all the stereo data from your
CD is contained on one track. The sound quality can be good, depending
on the bit rate you choose, but you lose all stereo-imaging data. Choose
the mono mode if the loss of the stereo image won’t adversely affect
your song, or if the overall sound quality is more important to you than
the stereo information.
Figure 2-3:
MP3
encoders

several
modes to

from.

✦Stereo: Stereo mode consists of two mono tracks. With stereo mode, you
retain all your stereo information. The drawback is that your two tracks
are at half the bit rate of a mono version using the same bit-rate setting,
so they don’t sound as good. For example, if you encode at 128 kBdps,
each of your stereo tracks is actually only 64 kBdps. If you want each
track to be at 128 kBdps, you have to encode at 256 kBdps. The resulting
file is twice as large as the mono file at 128 kBdps, has no better sound
quality, and takes longer to download.
Even so, it’s your call. Stereo mode is a good choice if you have a song
with complex stereo panning effects that you just can’t live without, and
you don’t mind a sound quality that’s slightly lower.
✦Joint Stereo: This mode is a cross between mono and stereo: It creates
one track of audio information and one track of information that tells the
player to send certain sounds through one speaker or the other (a set of
instructions called steering data). You get most of the stereo information
with only a slightly larger file size than you’d get with the mono mode.
For most songs, the difference in stereo image between regular stereo
and joint stereo is indistinguishable — and you end up with a higher
quality recording because the higher bit rate is used. You might find that
this option works better for you than the regular stereo mode.
Experiment and see whether you can hear a difference.
✦Force Stereo: Also known as dual mono, this mode is essentially the
same as the mono mode: One track of audio data is recorded, and the
stereo panning information is lost. The only difference between mono
and force stereo is that force stereo makes sure that the mono data is
played through both speakers of the player. Choose Force Stereo mode 
if you don’t mind your music being in mono but want to ensure that 
the player plays it through both speakers.
Creating MP3 Files
To create MP3 files, all you need (well, besides the computer) is MP3 encod-
ing software and a CD or audio file of your music. To create an MP3 of your
music, just choose the song to convert and let the encoder do the rest. Some
variables can make your MP3s sound their best, such as which encoder to
use and what parameters to choose. I cover these variables in the following
sections.
Choosing encoding software
A bunch of MP3 encoders are available, but you’re using Pro Tools, so I’m
going to recommend trying the MP3 option for Pro Tools. You can demo it
for 30 days to see whether you like it. If you do, pay $20 if you want to

continue using it. (This small fee pays for the license that Digidesign must
pay to use the MP3 algorithm from the creators.) Purchasing the MP3 
encoding option involves the following steps:
1. Log on to the Internet and go to http://store.digidesign.com.
The Avid/DigiStore page loads.
2. From the options listed on the left side of the page, select Pro Tools
Plug-ins, MP3 & Optional Software under the Software heading.
After the MP3 page loads, you find two MP3 types: MP3 Option
(Authorization Code Version for Pro Tools 5.0.1 and higher) and MP3
Option (iLok authorization Version for Pro Tools 7.3 and higher).
3. Click the Learn More link for the option that matches your computer
system and your software version.
The shopping cart page appears.
4. Click the Add to Cart button and follow the prompts to buy the 
software.
After you finish paying for your software, you receive an authorization code
that you can enter when you get the This Trial Has Expired alert when you
try to encode an MP3 using the Bounce to Disk function. (See the following
section.)
When this alert appears, click Authorize and enter the code when prompted.
If you decide you don’t like the MP3 option or if you want to find something
that costs less than $20, you might want to check out www.shareware.com.
This site contains shareware of all sorts, from games to word-processing
software to MP3 encoders. From the main page, just type MP3 into the key-
word search function and choose the computer platform that you use (Mac
or PC). You’re sure to find a bunch of matches for your search.
Encoding your music
The MP3 encoding process is pretty simple. To encode using the Pro Tools
MP3 option, follow these steps:
1. Select File➪Bounce to Disk.
The Bounce dialog box makes an appearance.
2. From the File Type drop-down menu, choose the MPEG-1 Layer 3
option.
3. From the other drop-down menus, choose the format, bounce source
(these are the outputs you want to record your audio from), sample
rate, and whether you want to convert during or after the bounce.

Creating MP3 Files
676
4. Click Bounce.
The MP3 window appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
5. Choose your encoding speed from the Encoding Speed drop-down
menu.
6. Select the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) radio button and choose the quality
of the MP3 from the drop-down menu.
For streaming audio, choose between 20 and 32 kBdps; for higher-quality
downloads, choose between 96 and 128 kBdps.
7. Enter the ID3 Tag Info in the dialog box.
This includes the name of the song, the artist’s name, the album title,
any comments you want to add, and the genre of your music.
8. Click OK.
The Save Bounce As dialog box opens.
9. Enter the name for your MP3 file in the Save As field.
10. From the Where drop-down menu, choose the location for your new
MP3 file.
11. Click Save.
Your file is bounced (this will take a few minutes), and the MP3 shows
up in the location that you specify in Step 10. You can take that file and
use it in your marketing efforts.

Hosting Your Music
When you have your music in MP3 format, it’s time to get it out into the
world. This involves either putting it on your own Web site or someone
else’s. The following sections explore the pros and cons of — as well as the
process involved in — both options. Chances are you’ll end up choosing a
combination approach if you’re serious about selling your music online.
Choosing a host site
As I mention earlier in this chapter, an Internet host site allows you to add
your music to its list of available music downloads. Putting your MP3s on a
host site can give you exposure that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get.
Not only can you direct people to the site to listen to your music, but you
can also benefit from the traffic that the site itself, other musicians, and the
site’s fans generate. For some larger sites, that traffic can add up to a lot of
potential listeners. Although MP3 host sites are constantly changing, a few
have managed to hang around for a while.
Internet music host sites are always coming and going. To find out what sites
are currently available and what they offer, check out http://compo10.
com/MusicHosts.htm for a comprehensive list.
Be sure to read and understand the contracts (often called agreements) that
each of these sites requires you agree to. Make sure that you don’t sign away
your rights to your music. If you’re not sure whether you like a particular
agreement, don’t sign up for the service. You can find plenty of other places
to put your music on the Internet.
AudioStreet.net
www.audiostreet.net
AudioStreet.net is a free music site, offering free music hosting and down-
loads. You can upload your songs, create a blog, and join the forum to 
connect with other musicians and your fans. Of course, beyond the basic
free plan (which gives you up to 3 songs, 20 pictures, a calendar for you to
list your upcoming gigs, and some other basic services), you can enroll in
for comprehensive plans that go from $10 to $20 per month.
GarageBand.com
www.garageband.com
GarageBand offers free MP3 hosting, and for free, offers you a Web page 
for each song, 200MB of storage (25 to 50 songs), and a few other things.
GarageBand makes its money off ads, contests, and its Gold membership,

Hosting Your Music
678
which includes listings in its gig calendar, one contest entry, plus a reduced
fee for additional entries. The Gold membership has a one-time fee of $100.
You can still enter contests without the membership for $20 if you just 
want the exposure and feedback that the contest offers. If you don’t want to
pay any money but still want to be part of a contest, you can agree to review
15 pairs of songs from other musicians. GarageBand has been around for 
a while and has a pretty large membership, so the community is pretty
dynamic. As well, having other musicians offer feedback can be helpful for
improving your sound (although it can also throw you off-course if you 
try to please everyone who has an opinion).
MySpace.com
www.myspace.com
MySpace.com has become the place to be on the Internet for many people.
Originally just a place to hang out for a few lonely souls, it’s become a cul-
tural phenomenon (of course, with the pace of the Internet, it could be gone
by the time this book is published — just like the other sites I list in this
book). Regardless, tons of people go to MySpace.com, so putting your music
there is probably a good idea. Besides, hosting for artists is free. You can
post up to four songs and you get your own URL.
Setting up your own site
Even if you put your music on an MP3 site, you should consider creating
your own Web site as well. With your own site, you can provide a lot more
information for visitors to read. You can also offer more products that might
make you more money than your CDs — T-shirts, for instance.
Having your own Web site is not without problems. For example, you have to
design and maintain the site, which can take a lot of time. You also have to
pay for things like hosting. Granted, you can find places to host your site for
free, but those are often thick with advertising for other stuff. If you intend
to sell products on your site, you need to provide online ordering, which
often involves setting up a merchant account with a credit card company. In
all, having a Web site can be time-consuming and expensive, so be prepared
to do a fair amount of work if you really plan to make money from your 
Web site.
If maintaining a full e-commerce Web site sounds like too much effort, you
can still make money from the Internet by using your Web site to promote
your band, especially if you get creative. In fact, with just a few simple steps,
you can have a Web site without the expense or the hassle (well, at least less
hassle), and still provide your visitors with a great Web experience. Here 
are a couple suggestions:

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Getting Your Music
on the Internet
Hosting Your Music
679
✦Create links from your site to your MP3 host site. This keeps you from
having to put MP3s or streaming audio on your Web site, and your 
visitors can still hear your music.
✦Get your CD on Amazon.com or CD Baby and link your visitors to
those sites to buy your CD. You don’t get as much money in your pocket,
but these other sites take care of all the ordering hassle for you. (You find
out how to sell your music through CD Baby and Amazon.com in the
“Selling Your CDs” section later in this chapter.)
Designing your site
Your first step in getting a Web site up and going is to design it. When you
design your Web site, keep the following things in mind:
✦Make your site easy to navigate. Make sure that your visitors know
where they are in your site at all times. Have a menu bar on each page
so they can at least get back to the home page without having to 
search for it.
✦Make sure that your site loads quickly. For those people who still use
dial-up modems (often as slow as 28 Kbps), sites with a ton of big graph-
ics or streaming videos take forever to download. Most people don’t
have the patience to wait. Think lean and mean. Your visitors will 
appreciate it more than a fancy, slow-to-load page.
✦Make ordering your CD (or other stuff) easy. Put a Buy My CD icon on
every page.
✦Double-check all your links. Nothing is worse to a Web surfer than a
bunch of links that lead nowhere. If you have links on your site, double-
check each one to be sure it works. And if you have links to other
people’s sites, check the links occasionally to make sure that the page
you’re linking to still exists.
✦Test your site. Before you sign off on your site design, check it from a
slow modem. You instantly get a sense of whether your site is dial-
up–friendly. If it’s slow to load or confusing, keep working on it until it
works. You may also want to check your site on different Internet
browsers and screen resolutions to make sure your site still looks good.
✦Make your site your home page in your browser. I had a site down for
weeks because I didn’t have it set as my default site in my browser. I
never got a chance to get there until I got a call from a friend who told
me it was down.

Web Pages All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Richard
Wagner and Richard Mansfield (Wiley).

Hosting Your Music
680
Putting up your site
After you design your site, you need to find an Internet service provider
(ISP) to host it. Most ISPs allow you to put up a personal Web page for free,
but if you want to do any business from it, you generally need to pay to have
your site hosted. The exception is Geocities (http://geocities.yahoo.
com/home), where you can put up a site for free. Geocities also has an 
inexpensive domain-hosting option ($8.95 per month) in which you can have
your name as your URL (www.jeffstrong.com, for instance).
This leads me to the whole domain-name thing. That is, a Web address that
has your name or your band’s name as the address. If you want your own
domain name, you need to register it and pay a fee. It used to be that all
domain names were purchased through Internic (now Network Solutions),
but now you can get a domain name in a lot of places. One of the most 
popular is GoDaddy.com. (I’m sure you can figure out its URL.) You can get 
a domain name for around $9 per year. You can also let them host your 
Web site for as little as $6.29 per month.
To find a place to buy and register your domain name, search for domain 
registration on your favorite search engine. You’ll end up with a ton of
matches to get you started.
After you choose an ISP and register a domain name — if you choose to go
that route — it’s just a matter of putting your site up and making sure it
works. Your ISP will either give you detailed instructions on how to do this
or do it for you.
Getting noticed
It used to be that you could submit your Web site’s address to the major
search engines and get exposure when people do a search. Over the last few
years, though, things have changed a lot. Nowadays, you can’t submit your
information and have your site show up in people’s searches. Still, you can
do some things to get more visibility with search engine optimization (SEO).
Countless professionals are available who will help you do this.
Here some basic steps you can take to improve your site’s ranking (how
close to the top your Web site shows up) in people’s searches:
✦Put keywords in your page titles. These might be descriptions of your
music, genre, song titles, or topics. Add anything that will help someone
understand who you are. (Keywords are words people use when they do
a search.) For example, someone may be looking for music in the genre
of electronica, and they want something with a drum and bass approach.
They may type electornica drum ’n bass into their search engine’s search
field. If you have electronica as a keyword in your page title, the search

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Getting Your Music
on the Internet
Providing Your Music Online
681
engine will see it and put you in the search results (how far up depends
on whether you also had drum ’n bass in your title and how many other
people have these keywords in their title).
✦Put keywords in your copy. Try to be descriptive in the text you use
anywhere in your Web site. Include words and terms to help people
looking for your type of music to find you.
✦Set up reciprocal links with other sites. Search engines are constantly
scouring the Internet for new links and sites. If you have a lot of links to
your site, it will show up higher in a relevant search then someone has a
fewer or no links. Not only do you get the benefit of possibly improving
your rank in searches, but having links to other musicians’ sites exposes
you to their fans (and yours to theirs). This can only be a good thing.
✦Create a blog. Blogs, because they are always adding pages, are seen by
search engines regularly as being new and updated. Search engines like
dynamic sites: that is, the ones that frequently add information. Some
people have suggested that a blog will show up more frequently than a
regular page. I don’t know whether this is true, but I can think of several
other reasons to have a blog than simply trying to get higher in the
search engine ranks. The main reason being that you are more accessi-
ble to your fans and creating new blog entries often increases the possi-
bility that your fans will return to your site often. A blog is better than a
newsletter for most musicians because it’s less formal, and you can talk
about anything you want.
SEO is a deep subject, taking a whole book to cover all the details. If you’re
interested in digging into SEO for your music I recommend picking up a copy
of Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Peter Kent
(Wiley).
Providing Your Music Online
If you have a Web site, you probably want your visitors to be able to hear
your music. You can make your music available for listening online in 
three ways:
✦Music downloads: These are files that your visitors can download to
their hard drives and listen to anytime that they want.
✦Streaming audio: This is a file that your visitor connects to that plays
without being copied to your visitor’s hard drive.
✦Podcasting: This is a way of broadcasting your music over the Internet
so that it can be downloaded automatically to a subscriber’s computer.
Each option has its advantages, which I outline in the following sections.

Providing Your Music Online
682
Offering downloads
Online promotion of your music almost requires you to make downloads
available to your potential fans. You can talk about your music all you want,
but what people want is to hear it. The purpose of the download is to get
your listener to buy your CD or to come see your show.
Put only a few of your best songs on your site (or on any site, for that
matter). If you make your entire CD available, visitors have no incentive to
buy it.
Streaming audio
Streaming audio is basically an MP3 file that plays without being down-
loaded. The advantage is that it greatly reduces the amount of time your 
listener has to wait to hear your music. The downside is that the quality of
the audio is lower.
You always want to make the process of navigating your site and listening to
your music as fast as possible. This provides a much better experience than
having to wait. The less time a person has to wait, the more likely he or she
is to return. The more repeat visitors that you get, the better chance you
have for selling CDs.
You can create streaming audio in many ways: You can use a RealAudio file
(a file format developed by Real Networks), a Windows Media File (WMV), 
or an MP3 file to mention a few. The process I describe below uses standard
MP3 files.
More people are moving to high-speed Internet connections, and these
people expect (and can stream) higher quality audio. You may want to create
a second audio stream using a higher bit rate, such as 128 kBdps. Just follow
these steps using the higher rate.
The following steps walk you through the process of getting your MP3 file 
to stream on your site:
1. Create an MP3 file, using a bit rate between 20 kBdps and 32 kBdps.
This is a good range for streaming audio over dial-up modems.
2. Save the MP3 file so that you can identify it.
The easiest way to do this is to save your file as songname24.mp3. 
(The 24 stands for 24 kBdps.)
3. Create a pointer file and name it songname24.m3u.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Getting Your Music
on the Internet
Providing Your Music Online
683
A pointer file is a file that directs your visitor’s audio player to the song
so that it plays without waiting for the entire song to download. This 
file contains directions to your MP3 file. For example, your file would
contain the following text:
www.YourWebSiteAddress/songname24.mp3
You can also use the M3U file to create a playlist. That is, have more
than one song play without your visitor needing to go to another link on
your web site. To do this, simply add another song on another line.
Adding two more songs would then look like this:
www.YourWebSiteAddress/songname24.mp3
www.YourWebSiteAddress/anothersongname24.mp3
www.YourWebSiteAddress/yetanothersongname24.mp3
The M3U file will play the songs in the order they are listed in this file.
Keep in mind that any visitor who doesn’t have an audio player can’t
listen to your music. Put a link on your site to another site where your
listener can download an audio player.
4. Create a hyperlink in your Web page to the songname24.m3u file.
For example, put in some text to the effect of Check out our new song,
songname and then link the text to the file. Or, you can place the 
hyperlink in a picture or graphic (or both).
5. Upload your MP3 file, your pointer file, and the new page with your
hyperlink to your Web site.
6. Go to your Web site to see whether it works.
Make sure that your site-hosting service has its MIME types configured for
MP3. Otherwise, your audio files won’t work. (Don’t worry. The people who
work for your hosting service will know what you’re talking about when you
mention MIME types. That’s their job.)
If all this sounds like too much work, you can just create a link to the stream-
ing files on your MP3 host site. That way, people can still hear your music,
even if it isn’t available on your site.
Podcasting
Podcasting is another way to offer audio online. Typically podcasts are
media feeds that your visitors can subscribe to and get updates automati-
cally as they are published. If you regularly update your music or if you want
to have an audioblog (or videoblog) that your fans can listen to (or watch),
this can be a great way to keep in their minds.

Providing Your Music Online
684
The process of creating a podcast starts with recording the content and then
putting it in an MP3 format (if you’re doing audio). You have Pro Tools, so
you can create audio content easily. Just follow the steps outlined through-
out the book to record and convert your music. Next, you need to host it or
have a podcasting site host it for you. This process can get pretty compli-
cated, so I recommend checking out Podcasting For Dummies by Tee Morris
and Evo Terra (Wiley). You can also check out these sites to learn more
about podcasting:
✦www.apple.com/itunes/stroe/podcadstingfaq.html: This 
page on the Apple Web site contains tons of information on creating a
podcast and publishing it. This is a good place to start.
✦www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-291804.html: Here is a
great podcast describing how to podcast, brought to you by the authors
of Podcasting For Dummies.
✦http://podcast.com: podcast.com has a ton of information about
podcasting, both from a subscriber’s and creator’s point of view. This is
a good site to get you up to speed on what podcasting is and what you
need to do it. The site doesn’t offer the tools and steps to create your
podcast, but once you have content and your feed information, you can
post your podcast on this site.
✦http://podcasting-tools.com: As the same suggests, this site has
information, links, and tools on creating a podcast. This is a good place
to get some quality information.
If you’re ready to get started podcasting, here are a couple of sites worth
looking into:
✦www.hipcast.com: Hipcast is an easy-to-use site that lets you create
and publish your audio or video blogs. This site offers a 7-day free trial
period with plans starting at $5 per month. There is not a lot of informa-
tion on this site about podcasting, but if you’re ready to give it a try, this
is a good inexpensive option.
✦http://mypodcast.com: This site offers free creating and publish-
ing of your podcast. Free is good, but when you record your podcast,
MyPodcast.com inserts advertisements into your audio. If you’re
strapped for cash and don’t mind the advertising, this might be a good
option.
✦http://podhoster.com: podHoster, as the name states, hosts pod-
casts. With this service, you record your audio, and they host it. This is
a good option for musicians who record their own music and know the
ins and outs of the audio-creation process (that would be you after
you’ve read this book). podHoster offers a 30-day free trial, with monthly
plans starting at $5.

Selling Your CDs
Regardless of whether you have your own Web site, you can always sell 
your CDs on the Internet through other outlets. One advantage to selling
your music through other online stores is that you can capitalize on the 
traffic that those stores generate. A number of online retailers exist, but the
following list sums up some of the major players:
✦CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com): CD Baby is an online record store that
specializes in independent artists. It puts your CD on its site for a very
small set-up fee ($35). For this, you get a Web page (which the people at
CD Baby design) with pictures, bios, MP3s, and streaming audio. The
site sells your CD for whatever price you set, takes $4 from the sale, 
and gives you the rest. You even receive an e-mail whenever someone
buys one of your CDs. Signing up is easy; just direct your browser to
www.cdbaby.com and click the Sell Your Music link. The instructions
are clear, and a lot of helpful articles on the site can help you to, well,
sell your CD.
✦GarageBand.com (www.garageband.com/musicians):
GarageBand.com works in partnership with CD Baby. You just set up a
membership with CD Baby and list your music on GarageBand.com. This
gives you more exposure without any extra expense. GarageBand.com
also has some great information to help you sell more of your music and
get gigs.
✦Amazon.com (www.amazon.com): Yes, you can get your music 
on Amazon.com, which boasts that it’s the world’s largest online 
retailer. Amazon.com has an Advantage program that allows you to put
your CD on its site and compete with major-label artists. All you need is
a professional CD package (retail-ready) with a UPC code on it. To join,
point your browser to www.amazon.com and click the Join Advantage
link at the bottom of the page. Follow the directions, and you’ll have
your music on the most prominent online retailer in no time.
Because the Internet is constantly changing and growing, you might find
other sites that allow you to sell your music online. Use your favorite search
engine to search for the term sell your CD. This gives a ton of other places to
consider selling your CD online.
Promoting Your Music
The whole point of making CDs and putting MP3s of your music on the
Internet is to promote and sell your music. To do this, you need exposure.
Like any promotion technique, there are no rules except to use your 
imagination. Experience will be your guide, but here are some ideas to 
get you started:

Promoting Your Music
686
✦Start an e-mail newsletter. An e-mail newsletter is an inexpensive way 
to keep your music on people’s minds. Try to be somewhat consistent 
in sending it out, but don’t just send out the same message on a regular
basis. Give your subscribers something. Provide new information in
your e-mail, such as a press release about where you’re playing next or 
a link to a new song that you’ve just uploaded. Note: Don’t send your
newsletter to anyone who hasn’t asked to receive it. This is spamming,
and it’s illegal. To build up a subscriber list, encourage people to fill in
your mailing list sign-up forms at your gigs and on your Web site or offer
them a free download to sign up on your Web site and put a subscription
form on the top of every page. (Check out my day-job Web site to see
this in action at www.reiinstitute.com.) Always provide a way for
them to unsubscribe from your list — and make it easy to do so.
✦Put your Web site address on everything. People can’t come to you if
they don’t know that you exist. So print your Web site address on all
your promotional materials, including the CD itself. Also, include your
Web site address on all e-mails and Internet correspondence that you do
(as a signature on Internet forums if you belong to any, for example).
✦Network. Check out as many independent-musician sites as you can.
You not only learn a lot about marketing your music, but you’ll also 
have an opportunity to spread the word about your music. Check out
GarageBand.com (www.garageband.com), Getsigned.com (www.
getsigned.com), and indiecentre.com (www.indiecentre.com), 
for starters.
✦Stay up to date. Keep track of where you put your music and check back
often to make sure everything is working properly. Web sites change 
and go out of business often. Unless you check the site occasionally, you
might not know if your music suddenly disappears from there. Also, 
routinely search for new places to put your music.
✦Get linked. Try to get folks to link from their sites to your own. Likewise,
share the wealth and link to other sites that you like. Cross-promotion
can be a good thing and allow you to pool your fan base with another
band. This doesn’t take away from your sales (after all, you listen to
more than one band’s CDs, right?). Visitors to your site will appreciate
the link and will probably check back to see whether you added any 
new ones.
