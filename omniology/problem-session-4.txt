Solving Instances Vs. Solving 
Problems
How to Market Your P=NP 
Solution

2
Telling What a Program Does
Suppose I write a program to sort 
integers.
Can’t I feed it a list of integers and see 
whether they come out sorted?
Or a million lists and check them all?
Yes, but maybe your program will fail 
to sort the 1,000,001th list you try.

3
Solving Instances Vs. Solving 
Problems
Instances of a problem are not problems.
Suppose TM M accepts language L, and 
w is a string.
One TM Myes ignores its input and accepts.
Another TM Mno ignores its input and rejects.
One answers the question “is w in L?”
But I can’t tell which.

Polytime Algorithms for Part of 
an NP-complete problem
Suppose I have a polytime algorithm 
that works correctly on all tested 
instances of an NP-complete problem.
Could I sell that solution?
Could I keep it secret so only I could solve 
NP-complete problems in polytime?

5
Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Developed by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio 
Micali, and Charles Rackoff in 1985.
An early idea in cryptographic protocols.
Let’s you prove that you know 
something without revealing how you 
know it.
Hypothetical polytime algorithm for an NP-
complete problem was key motivation.

6
Polytime Algorithm for 
Instances of a Problem
It is possible to find polytime 
algorithms that solve instances of NP-
complete problems.
Or even a million instances.
But as for the analogous matter of 
decidability, it doesn’t help us. 

7
Testing Polytime Solutions
What about a polytime  “solution” to 
SAT that we test on 1,000,000 inputs 
and it gives the correct answer each 
time.
How do you know it is correct?
If a satisfying assignment exists, we 
could expect the tester to show us one.
Which we could then check.

8
Testing Polytime Solutions – (2)
But what if the algorithm says “no”?
We can’t even check that it is correct in less 
than exponential time.
But if the expression has many satisfying 
assignments, we could try a few at random.
Alas, expressions with one satisfying 
assignment exist.
Consider Cook’s construction applied to a DTM.
