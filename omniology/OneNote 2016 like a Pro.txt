How to Use This Guide (Please Read!)
This guide is an unofficial manual of OneNote 2016 and it should be used just like you use any
reference book or manual.
To quickly find a topic, please use the table of contents. In addition, you can press Ctrl + F to
search for any word or phrase in this guide. This will allow you to quickly find information and
save time.
When I say you should press any key combination, for example when I say you should
press Ctrl + J or just any other key, what I mean is that you should press and hold keyboard's
Control (Ctrl) and then press J key. You can also press these two keys simultaneously, if you
can.
In addition, When I say you should carry out a set of tasks, for example when I say you should
Click All settings > System > Notifications & actions, what I mean is that you should click on
All settings and then Click on System. And lastly, you should click on Notifications & actions.
Lastly, I have based most of the information contained in this guide on the assumption that you
are going to be controlling your OneNote 2016 with the trackpad. However, you will still get
similar result by using your finger or stylus pen to control the touchscreen. For example, when I
tell you to click an item using the trackpad, you will get a similar result if you click the item with
a finger or stylus pen. In addition, when I tell you to right-click an item, you can also hold your
finger down on the item to get similar results as you would get when you right-click.
I hope this guide helps you get the most out of your OneNote 2016.

OneNote templates allow you to give a unique look to your pages. For example, you can use an
academic template when writing an academic note.
