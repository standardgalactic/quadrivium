Wireless Basics & Terminologies

• AP – Access Point
• PSK – Pre-Shared Key 
• SSID – Service Set Identifier (Name of AP)
• ESSID – Extended Service Set Identifier 
(Spans Multiple APs, Synonym for SSID)
• BSSID – Basic Service Set Identifier
(Unique to each AP -> MAC of AP)
• Channels in 2.4 GHz (1 – 11, some 1 – 14)
• Channels in 5 GHz (36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 
157, 161 and others)
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Acronyms)

• RSSI – Received Signal Strength Indicator
• Beacon – Short signal / broadcast from AP to 
inform clients of presence. Clients also use 
beacons to connect
• PWR – dBm is a unit of measurement used 
to express the power level of a signal in 
decibels relative to one milliwatt.
• Gain -Antenna gain amplifies signal strength 
in a specific direction.
• 802.11 wireless half duplex! Transceiver 
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Acronyms)

• Frame - A wireless frame is a formatted unit 
of data used in wireless communication that 
contains control information, payload data, 
and addressing information for transmission 
over a wireless network.
• VLAN - A VLAN is a virtual network that 
partitions a physical network into separate, 
isolated networks.
• Trunk - A trunk is a link that carries multiple 
VLANs.
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(802.11 frames, VLANs, Trunks)

• Beacon (SSID, Capability, Supported Rates)
• Probe Request (from client)
• Probe Response (from AP)
• Authentication Request
• Authentication Response
• Association Request
• Association Response 
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(802.11 frames)

• 802.11a (up to 54 Mbps, 5 GHz, 1999)
• 802.11b (up to 11 Mbps, 2.4 GHz, 1999)
• 802.11g (up to 54 Mbps, 2.4 GHz, 2003)
• 802.11n (100s of Mbps, both, 2009)
• 802.11ac (several Gbps, 5 GHz, 2013)
• 802.11ax (several Gbps, both, 2019)
• 802.11ay (under dev. 60 GHz frequencies)
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Data rates)

• Power levels vary by country
• US FCC for 2.4 GHz (max. 1 Watt / 30 dBm)
• US FCC for 5 GHz (max. 4 Watt / 36 dBm)
• Europe for 2.4 GHz (max. 100 mW / 20 dBm)
• Europe for 5 GHz (100 mW- 1 Watt / 20 – 30 
dBm)
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Power Levels)

• Master Mode 
client card provides (with the right software) 
AP services
• Managed Mode 
Acts as a client (like laptop, smartphone etc. 
connecting to AP) 
• Monitor Mode
aka promiscuous mode (needed for sniffing)
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Wireless Client Modes)

• 2.4 GHz bands
Most widely used, good penetration through 
objects, loads of interference
• 5 GHz bands
Gained popularity in recent years, bad in 
penetration through objects, larger distance, 
less interference
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Frequencies)

• Omni Directional (360 degree)
• Yagi (Highly directional) – P2P links 
• Directional
• Sector (Angle)
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Antennas)

• Decibels (log function)
• 0 dB = same power
• 3 dB = twice the power 
• -3 dB = half the power
• 10 dB = 10 x the power
• -10 dB = 1/10 of the power
• 0 dBm = 1 mW 
• 30 dBm = 1 W
• -20 dBM = 0.01 mW 
• EIRP = Transmitter power (dBm) - Cable loss 
in dB + Antenna Gain in dBi 
Wireless Basics & Terminologies
(Signal Strength)

• -30 dBm – maximum (right next to AP)
• -50 dBm – excellent 
• -60 dBm – good 
• -67 dBm – Reliable and minimum for service
• -70 dBm – not good (email reading at best)
• -80 dBm – unreliable 
• -90 dBm – bad
