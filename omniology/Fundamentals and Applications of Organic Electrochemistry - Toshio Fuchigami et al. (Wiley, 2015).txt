Preface
Organic electrochemistry is electrochemistry
focused on organic molecules, while inorganic
electrochemistry
deals
with
inorganic
molecules,
which
is
a
major
part
of
fundamentals
and
applications
of
electrochemistry. In fact, most industrialized
electrode
processes
are
inorganic.
Electrochemistry is mainly based on physical
chemistry
such
as
thermodynamics
and
kinetics.
Many
mathematical
equations
are
used in electrochemistry textbooks and organic
chemists therefore think that electrochemistry
is difficult. Similarly, organic chemistry deals
with
organic
molecules
and
complicated
reactions, therefore physical chemists often
dislike organic chemistry.
Organic electrochemistry, particularly organic
electrosynthesis,
has
developed
by
incorporating
new
organic
reactions
and
organic
synthesis.
The
21st
century
is
sometimes called the ecological century, and
organic
electrosynthesis
is
a
typical
green
sustainable chemistry since it does not require
any hazardous reagents and produces less waste
than other chemical synthesis. Furthermore,
organic
electrochemistry
has
also
recently
developed as integrated field including not only
organic
electrosynthesis
but
also
materials
25

chemistry, catalysis chemistry, biochemistry,
medicinal
chemistry
and
environmental
chemistry.
In
our
daily
lives
organic
and
polymer
materials
play
important
roles
in
technologies such as biosensors, conducting
polymers, liquid crystals, electroluminescence
materials, dye-sensitized solar cells and so on.
To understand these technologies we must
study the basics of both organic chemistry and
electrochemistry. In this century, the area of
interest
is
diversity,
therefore
students,
particularly graduate students, can no longer be
engaged
in
developments
in
cutting-edge
technology
unless
they
understand
the
fundamental principles of various sciences such
as organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and
physical chemistry, regardless of their own
specialized scientific background.
In
addition,
organic
electrochemistry
also
involves organic electron transfer chemistry
using electrical energy. In this way organic
electrochemistry
is
quite
similar
to
photoelectron transfer, which is an important
field of organic photochemistry using light
energy. Although a number of fundamental
books dealing with organic photochemistry
have
been
published,
there
has
been
no
textbook dealing with the basic aspects of
organic
electrode
electron
transfer
and
its
applications together with new fields.
26

In
this
book,
the
authors
have
concisely
produced their organic electrochemistry lecture
notes
for
graduate
students.
The
text
is
arranged for graduate students, researchers and
engineers
to
easily
understand
the
basic
principles of electrochemistry, electrochemical
measurements
and organic electrosynthesis,
including
its
new
methodologies.
Some
experimental
examples
of
organic
electrosynthesis are also described in detail.

Introduction
Toshio Fuchigami
The concept of organic electrochemistry is
relatively new, even though it has a long
history. In 1800, an Italian physicist named
Volta invented the well-known Voltaic pile.
Three years later, Petrov in Russia published a
paper
on
the
electrolysis
of
alcohols
and
aliphatic oils. A year after that, Grotthuss in
Lithuania, who proposed the ionic conducting
mechanism, found that a diluted solution of
indigo white could be readily electrochemically
oxidized to indigo blue. In 1833, Faraday
discovered Faraday's law, and one year later he
found that hydrocarbons could be formed by
the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of the
acetic acid salt. Unfortunately, he could not
identify
the
products.
In
1849,
Wöhler's
disciple, Kolbe, discovered the electrochemical
oxidation of a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) to the
dimeric alkane (R–R) and CO2, known as Kolbe
electrolysis
[1].
Consequently,
Faraday
and
Kolbe are pioneers in the investigation of
organic electrochemical processes. From the
end of the 19th century to the early 20th
century,
electrochemical
oxidation
and
reduction processes of various compounds were
intensively investigated. Thus, the application
of electrolysis for preparing organic compounds
29

continued in the first half of the 20th century. A
typical example is the electrochemical reduction
process of nitrobenzene to aniline. Importantly,
organic electrochemistry was also developed
along
with
the
discovery
of
new
electroanalytical
techniques
such
as
polarography,
which
was
developed
by
Heyrovský and Tachi in the early 1920s [2].
However, organic electrosynthesis research had
to be completely halted during the Second
World War.
In 1964, Baizer developed the electrochemical
hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile, which is a
highly
useful
industrial
process
for
the
manufacture of adiponitrile. This invention
restimulated organic electrosynthesis research
by many electrochemists and organic chemists.
Since
then,
the
development
of
organic
electrochemistry,
particularly
organic
electrosynthesis,
has
been
marked
by
incorporating new types of organic reactions
and modern organic synthesis. Furthermore,
various aprotic polar organic solvents have
been developed, and these enable us to detect
electrogenerated
unstable
intermediates.
In
addition,
cyclic
voltammetry
and
related
electroanalytical techniques have assisted in the
understanding of kinetics and mechanisms of
organic electrode processes.
Organic
electrochemistry
has
recently
developed as an integrated field including not
30

only organic electrosynthesis but also materials
chemistry, catalysis chemistry, biochemistry,
medicinal
chemistry
and
environmental
chemistry.
The 21st century is known as the ecological
century. Organic electrosynthesis is expected to
be a typical green chemistry process since it
does not require any hazardous reagents and
produces less waste than conventional chemical
synthesis.
Recently,
a
novel
paired
electrosynthesis
of
phthalide
and
p-t-butyl
benzaldehyde
has
been
developed
and
industrialized by BASF in Germany, and they
consider
electrosynthesis
to
be
the
most
promising green synthetic process. These facts
have prompted organic electrochemists as well
as organic chemists to make great efforts to
develop new systems of organic electrosynthesis
in order to achieve green and sustainable
chemistry. In fact, a number of successful new
green organic electrolytic systems have been
developed to date, as illustrated in this book.
We believe that cutting-edge developments in
organic
electrochemistry
will
be
achieved
through
hybridization
with
other
scientific
fields, as mentioned above.

Mahito Atobe
Chemists often encounter situations in which a
reaction does not proceed at a convenient rate
under the initially selected set of conditions. In
chemistry, activation energy is defined as the
minimum energy required to start a chemical
reaction, and hence the activation energy must
be put into a chemical system in order for a
chemical reaction to occur. Catalysts are often
used to reduce the activation energy but a high
temperature is still required for the reaction to
proceed at an appreciable rate. Electrochemical
reactions, however, can generally be carried out
under mild conditions (room temperature and
ambient pressure).
In
electrochemical
reactions
there
is
an
additional
experimental
parameter,
the
electrode
potential,
involved
in
the
manipulation of electrochemical reaction rates.
Electron transfer rates can easily be varied over
many
orders
of
magnitude
at
a
single
temperature by proper control of the electrode
potential. Indeed, electrode potential is so
powerful a parameter for controlling the rates
of electrochemical reactions that most reactions
can be carried out at or near room temperature.
An
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
dependence
of
electron
transfer
rates
on
potential
is
important
for
understanding
33

electrode processes and constitutes the central
theme of this chapter. Because electron transfer
at
an
electrode
surface
is
necessarily
a
heterogeneous process, it will be necessary to
examine
briefly
the
structure
of
the
electrode–solution interface and its effects on
the course of an electrochemical reaction. It is
not enough, however, to simply derive the
relationship between electron transfer rate and
electrode potential. This is because as a result of
the
dramatic
changes
in
these
rates
with
potential, it is generally found that at certain
potentials electron transfer is so fast that the
overall process is actually limited by the rate of
mass transport of the substrate from the bulk
solution to the electrode surface. There are
different modes of mass transport, and they
differ in efficiency, therefore it will be necessary
to examine each of these influences.
1.1 Formation of Electrical Double
Layer
When electrodes are polarized in an electrolyte
solution, the charge held at the electrodes is
important. In order to neutralize a charge
imbalance
across
the
electrode–solution
interface, the rearrangement of charged species
like ions in the solution near the electrode
surface will occur within a few hundredths of a
second, and finally result in strong interactions
occurring between the ions in solution and the
34

electrode
surface.
This
gives
rise
to
the
electrical
double
layer,
whose
thickness
is
usually between 1 and 10 nm (Figure 1.1) [1].
There exists a potential gradient over the
electrical double layer and the gradient is no
longer
confirmed
to
the
bulk
electrolyte
solution. The potential difference between the
electrode
surface
and
the
bulk
solution
illustrated in Figure 1.1 may amount to a volt or
more, over the rather short distance of the
thickness of the double layer, and hence this is
an extremely steep gradient, in the order of 106
V cm−1 or greater, which is an electrical field of
considerable intensity. This is the driving force
for the electrochemical reaction at electrode
interfaces,
therefore
when
the
polarization
between
anode
and
cathode
is
increased
gradually, the potential gradient in the vicinity
of the anode and cathode is also increased and
consequently the most oxidizable and reducible
species
in
the
system
are
subject
to
an
electron-transfer reaction at the anode and
cathode,
respectively.
Because
a
charge
imbalance in the vicinity of an electrode takes
place after the electron-transfer reaction, ions
are transferred to the electrode interface to
neutralize the imbalance, and consequently the
continued Faradic current is observed. Thus,
the electrolyte in a solution plays a role in the
formation of the electrical double layer and the
neutralization
of
a
charge
imbalance
after
electrolysis.

potential distribution in the double layer
1.2 Electrode Potentials (Redox
Potentials)
In all electrochemical experiments the reactions
of interest occur at the surface of the working
electrode
therefore
we
are
interested
in
controlling
the
potential
drop
across
the
interface between the surface of the working
electrode and the solution. However, it is
impossible to control or measure this interfacial
potential without placing another electrode in
the solution. Thus, two interfacial potentials
must be considered, neither of which can be
measured
independently.
Hence,
one
requirement for the counter electrode is that its
interfacial potential remains constant so that
36

any
changes
in
the
cell
voltage
produce
identical changes in the working electrode
interfacial
potential.
An
electrode
whose
potential does not vary with the current is
referred
to
as
an
ideal
non-polarizable
electrode, but there is no electrode that behaves
in
this
way.
Consequently,
the
interfacial
potential
of
the
counter
electrode
in
the
two-electrode system discussed above varies as
the current is passed through the cell. This
problem is overcome by using a three-electrode
system in which the functions of the counter
electrode are divided between the reference and
auxiliary
electrodes
(Figure
1.2)
[2].
This
ensures that the potential between the working
and reference electrodes is controlled and the
current
passes
between
the
working
and
auxiliary
electrodes.
The
current
passing
through
the
reference
electrode
is
further
diminished by using a high-input impedance
operational amplifier for the reference electrode
input.
37

Figure
1.2
Experimental
setup
for
the
three-electrode system
By employing the three-electrode system we
can control or measure the working electrode
potential.
We
then
consider
the
essential
meaning of the potential control using the
following simple redox couple (Eq. 1.1):
(1.1)
38

where Red and Ox represent the reduced and
oxidized forms of a given species.
It is helpful to focus on the energy of electrons
in the working metal electrode and in the Red
species in the electrolyte solution, as depicted in
Figure 1.3. The behaviour of electrons in a
metal electrode can be partly understood by
considering the Fermi-level (EF) [3]. Metals are
composed of closely packed atoms that have
strong overlap between one another. A piece of
metal therefore does not possess the individual
well-defined electron energy levels that would
be found in a single atom of the same material.
Instead a continuum of levels exists, with the
available electrons filling the states from the
bottom upwards. The Fermi-level corresponds
to the energy of the highest occupied orbitals
(HOMO). This level is not fixed and can be
moved
by
supplying
electrical
energy
(see
Figure 1.3). We are therefore able to alter the
energy
of
the
Fermi-level
by
applying
a
potential to an electrode (when a negative
potential is applied, the Fermi-level moves to
higher energy; when a positive potential is
applied,
it
moves
to
a
lower
energy.).
Depending on the position of the Fermi-level it
may be thermodynamically feasible to reduce/
oxidize species in solution. Figure 1.3 shows the
Fermi-level within a metal along with the
orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) of a
molecule (Red) in solution.
39

Figure 1.3 Fermi-level within a metal along
with the orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO)
of a molecule (Red) in solution
As shown in Figure 1.3a, the Fermi-level has a
higher value than the HOMO of Red. It is
therefore thermodynamically unfavourable for
an electron to jump from the HOMO to the
electrode. However, as shown in Figure 1.3c,
when the Fermi-level is below the HOMO of
Red it is thermodynamically favourable for the
electron transfer to occur and we can observe
current for the oxidation of Red. The critical
potential at which this electron-transfer process
occurs identifies the standard potential, Eo, of
the redox couple Red/Ox (see Figure 1.3b).
1.3 Activation Energy and
Overpotential
As mentioned in section 1.2, depending on the
relative position of the Fermi-level to the orbital
energies (HOMO and LUMO) of a substrate
40

molecule
in
solution,
it
may
be
thermodynamically feasible to reduce/oxidize
the
molecule.
However,
in
general
electrochemical
reactions
possess
energy
barriers that must be overcome by the reacting
species.
This
energy
barrier
is
called
the
activation energy (see Figure 1.4). Hence, the
potential difference above the equilibrium value
(the standard potential, Eo) is usually required
to produce a current. This potential difference
between
the
standard
potential
and
the
potential
at
which
the
redox
event
is
experimentally
observed
is
called
the
overpotential [4].

1.4 Currents Controlled by
Electron Transfer and Mass
Transport
Although electrode potential is an extremely
important
experimental
parameter
for
manipulation of electrochemical reaction rates,
other parameters such as mass transport can
also affect reaction rates. We now consider the
simplest
electrochemical
model,
which
is
composed of the electron transfer process and
the mass transfer process, as shown in Figure
1.5. In this case, depending on the electrode
potential, the rate-determining step might be
either the electron transfer rate or the rate of
mass transport of the substrate to the electrode
surface.
To
examine
the
quantitative
and
semiquantitative
interrelationships
between
potential, electrochemical reaction rates and
mass transport, a wide variety of voltammetric
experiments are commonly used [5].
42

Figure 1.5 Electrochemical model showing the
electron transfer process and the mass transfer
process
We will now consider the factors affecting the
relative heights and shapes of voltammetric
waves such as those in Figure 1.6. As the
electrode
potential
is
scanned
during
a
voltammogram (to more negative potentials for
a reduction or more positive potentials for an
oxidation),
the
electron
transfer
rates
are
dramatically
increased
and
a
voltammetric
curve passes through a mixed region in which
the
rates
of
mass
transport
and
electron
transfer both limit the electrolysis current.
Finally, the electron transfer rate eventually
reaches a high enough rate that the currents are
purely
mass
transfer
limited,
and
the
mass-transport-limited voltammetric peak and
plateau currents are observed in quiet and
stirred solution, respectively. For this reason
the equations dealing with the electrolysis
current are different for each rate-determining
step.
43

Figure 1.6 Voltammetric waves in quiet and
stirred solution
When the electrochemical reaction is controlled
by the electron transfer step, the net electrolysis
current
density
(i)
is
represented
by
the
Butler–Volmer equation (Eq. 1.2) [4]. This
equation describes how the current density (i)
on an electrode depends on the overpotential
(η), considering that both a cathodic and an
anodic reaction occur on the same electrode:
(1.2)
where ia and ic are the individual anodic and
cathodic current densities, respectively, i0 is the
exchange current density, α is the charge
transfer coefficient (its value lies between 0 and
1,
frequently
being
about
0.5
at
lower
44

overpotentials), n is the number of electrons
involved in the electrode reaction, F is the
Faraday constant and η is the overpotential. As
indicated by the Butler–Volmer equation, the
net current density is the difference between
the cathodic and anodic current densities. In
addition, the exchange current density is that
current in the absence of net electrolysis and at
zero overpotential.
When the electrochemical reaction is controlled
by the mass transfer step, the electrolysis
current density relates to the magnitude of the
gradient
of
the
substrate
molecule
concentration
at
the
electrode
surface,
represented by Eq. 1.3 [6]:
(1.3)
where n is the number of electrons involved in
the
electrode
reaction,
F
is
the
Faraday
constant, D is the diffusion coefficient (the rate
constant for motion of the substance through
the given medium by diffusion), c is the
substrate
molecule
concentration,
x
is
the
distance from the electrode surface and hence
(dc/dx)x=0
represents
the
gradient
of
the
substrate
molecule
concentration
at
the
electrode surface. The concentration profiles for
the substrate and product in quiet solution are
shown in Figure 1.7. Since the thickness of the
diffusion layer and hence the concentration
gradient change as electrolysis proceeds in
45

quiet
solution,
the
decrease
in
electrolysis
current is observed in its voltammogram, as
illustrated in Figure 1.6a.
Figure
1.7 Change in the diffusion layer
thickness with electrolysis time
In the presence of convection, for example
stirring, the variation of the diffusion layer with
time is inhibited and hence the concentration
gradient is constant. In this case, a limiting
current density (id) related to the diffusion layer
thickness (δ) would be observed [5]:
(1.4)
Equation 1.4 describes the current density at
the plateau of a voltammogram measured in
stirred solution (Figure 1.6b), provided that the
potential
is
scanned
rapidly,
so
the
concentration of the substrate in the bulk of the
solution is not significantly depleted during the
time needed to measure the voltammogram. In
addition, since δ is reduced by more efficient
stirring, the limiting current densities in stirred
solution increase with the stirring rate. They are
of course much larger than the current densities
in quiet solution because convection is so much
46

more efficient than diffusion at transporting the
substrate molecule to the electrode surface.

Mahito Atobe
One of the main aims of this book is to
understand
the
mechanism
of
organic
electrochemical reactions in order to use them
most effectively or in new ways. Nowadays a
number
of
specific
electrochemical
measurements are used to obtain mechanistic
information
about
organic
electrochemical
reactions.
Among
these
measurements,
voltammetry is one of the most frequently used
techniques since it provides enough evidence
concerning the mechanism of an electrode
process
to
allow
us
to
use
this
process
intelligently in synthesis and to develop new
electrochemical reactions.
In this chapter we will introduce voltammetric
techniques to obtain mechanistic information
for organic electrochemical reactions. Because
the
success
or
failure
of
voltammetric
measurements depends to a great degree on the
proper selection of experimental components
such
as
electrochemical
cells,
electrodes,
solvents and electrolytes, we will discuss some
concerns about experimental components for
voltammetry. In addition, this chapter will also
show how voltammetry can be used to obtain
information about the mechanism of a new
organic electrode reaction.
49

2.1 Working Electrodes
Voltammetry is the group of electrochemical
techniques
where
current
is
studied
as
a
response
to
the
potential
of
the
working
electrode. Experiments are usually carried out
using a three-electrode system in which the
potential between the working and reference
electrodes is controlled and the current passes
between the working and auxiliary electrodes
[1].
Since
the
measured
electrochemical
reaction occurs at the working electrode, the
selection of the working electrode material is
critical
to
the
experimental
success
of
voltammetry.
The
electrolytes
can
be
used
without
appreciable degradation only in limit ranges of
electrical
potential.
This
potential
window
should be as wide as possible to allow for the
greatest
degree
of
studied
sample
characterization
[2].
The
upper
and
lower
potential limits are determined not only by the
electrolytic solution but also by the electrode
material. In aqueous electrolytes, oxygen and
hydrogen evolution reactions limit the potential
window, and hence the window is usually
narrower than that in non-aqueous electrolytes.
To overcome this problem, cathode materials
with high hydrogen overpotential and anode
materials with high oxygen overpotential are
usually used as working electrode materials for
voltammetry in aqueous electrolytes. Platinum
50

and gold are good anode materials because of
their
higher
oxygen
overpotential,
while
mercury, zinc and lead are good candidates for
cathode
materials
because
of
their
higher
hydrogen overpotential. However, the toxicity
of mercury has lead to a limited use. On the
other hand, the non-aqueous electrolytes are
stable and their potential windows are generally
larger
than
those
of
aqueous
electrolytes,
therefore there are few limitations for the
choice of working electrode materials. The most
commonly used working electrode materials for
voltammetry in non-aqueous electrolytes are
platinum, gold and carbon. Although almost all
noble metals can be used as both anode and
cathode materials, base metals are unsuitable
as anode materials because of their dissolution
under anodic polarization.
Various shapes (e.g. disks, wires, plates) and
sizes (e.g. a few square centimetres for plate
electrodes,
a
few
micrometres
to
a
few
centimetres in disk diameter) of solid electrodes
are
used
for
voltammetric
measurements
(Figure 2.1). Solid electrodes for voltammetric
measurements are most often fabricated by
encapsulating
the
electrode
material
in
a
non-conducting
sheath
of
glass
or
inert
polymeric
material
like
Teflon,
Kel-F
(poly-chlorotrifluoroethylene)
or
PEEK
(poly-etheretherketone). Most commonly, the
exposed electrode material is in the form of a
disk
(Figures
2.1a
and
b).
Common
51

commercially available disk diameters range
from 1 μm to 1 cm. Metal plate electrodes are
usually connected to a lead wire by spot
welding, and the wire part is encapsulated in a
non-conducting
sheath
of
glass
or
inert
polymeric material (Figure 2.1c).
Figure 2.1 Examples of handmade working
electrodes
Ideally, a working electrode should behave in
the same way each time it is used. The factors
that affect the electrochemical behaviour of a
surface are its cleanliness, the kind and extent
of chemical functionalities (including oxides)
that are present, and the microstructure of the
electrode
material
itself.
Generally,
a
pre-treatment step or steps will be carried out
prior to each experiment to ensure that the
electrode surface condition can be reproduced
from experiment to experiment. These steps
may be as simple as mechanical polishing, and
may include pre-scanning across a certain
potential range or exposure to a solvent or
52

chemical
species
to
activate
the
electrode.
Specific
procedures
for
different
electrode
materials can be found in references [1] and [2],
and those contained therein.
2.2 Reference Electrodes
The potential of the reference electrode must be
stable and reproducible. In aqueous solutions,
the method for measuring electrode potentials
has been well established [3]. The standard
hydrogen
electrode
(SHE)
is
the
primary
reference electrode and its potential is defined
as
zero
at
all
temperatures.
Practical
measurements employ reference electrodes that
are easy to use, the most popular ones being a
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (Figure 2.2a)
and a silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode
(Figure 2.2b). In contrast, in non-aqueous
solutions the method for measuring electrode
potential has not been established. The most
serious problem is the reference electrode, that
is, there is no primary reference electrode such
as the SHE for non-aqueous electrolytes and no
reference electrode as reliable as the aqueous
Ag/AgCl electrode. However, efforts are being
made to improve this situation.
53

Figure 2.2 Examples of handmade reference
electrodes
The reference electrodes used in non-aqueous
systems can be classified into two types. One
type is an aqueous reference electrode, usually
an
aqueous
Ag/AgCl
electrode
or
SCE.
However,
the
aqueous
reference
electrode
should
not
be
dipped
directly
into
the
non-aqueous solution under study because the
solution is contaminated with water and the
electrolyte (usually KCl). To prevent this, the
reference electrode should be in a separate
compartment and a salt bridge used for the
ion-conducting
connection
between
the
working
electrode
and
reference
electrode
compartments (see Figure 2.3c). The tip of the
salt bridge, which is filled with the non-aqueous
electrolytes under study, is dipped into the
non-aqueous
solution.
When
such
aqueous
reference
electrodes
are
used,
the
liquid
junction potential between the aqueous and
non-aqueous solutions must be taken into
54

account. To improve this situation, the IUPAC
Commission on Electrochemistry proposed that
the Fc+/Fc couple should be measured in the
same
system
and
the
electrode
potential
reported as values referred to the apparent
standard potential of the system. As for the
other method, the same solvent as that of the
solution under study is used for an internal
solvent in the reference electrode. The Ag/Ag+
electrode
is
the
most
popular
reference
electrode used in non-aqueous solutions, and it
can be used in a variety of solvents (Figure
2.2c).
Figure 2.3 Examples of voltammetric cells
55

Although the reference electrodes introduced in
this section are commercially available, they
can also be made in the laboratory.
2.3 Auxiliary Electrodes
The auxiliary electrode, often also called the
counter electrode, is an electrode used in a
three-electrode
electrochemical
cell
for
voltammetry in which the electrical current
passes
between
the
working
and
auxiliary
electrodes. The auxiliary electrode therefore
functions as a cathode whenever the working
electrode is operating as an anode and vice
versa. The auxiliary electrode often has a
surface area much larger than that of the
working
electrode
to
ensure
that
the
half-reaction
occurring
at
the
auxiliary
electrode can occur fast enough so as not to
limit the process at the working electrode [4].
Platinum (e.g. Pt wire, Pt plate) is a good
material for the auxiliary electrode due to its
high stability.
2.4 Solvents and Supporting
Electrolytes
The
important
factors
for
solvents
in
voltammetry are the potential window, the
solubility of the substrate molecule under study
and physical-chemical properties such as donor
or solvating properties [5]. Although water is
56

often used as a solvent for voltammetry, many
organic substrates are water-insoluble or only
sparingly soluble. In addition, the oxygen and
hydrogen evolution reactions limit the potential
window when water is used as a solvent for
voltammetry. The voltammetric experiments
for organic substrates are therefore usually
carried out in polar organic solvents in which
the supporting electrolyte can dissociate into
ions. Acetonitrile (dielectric constant
= 38) is
one of the most frequently used solvents since
its high upper and lower potential limits allow it
to be used as a solvent for both electrochemical
oxidation
and
reduction
reactions.
Other
frequently used solvents for electrochemical
oxidation
are
dichloromethane
(
=
9),
nitromethane (
= 37), propylene carbonate (
= 64) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (
= 3), while
other
frequently
used
solvents
for
electrochemical
reduction
are
N,N-dimethylformamide(DMF,
=
37),
dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO,
=
47),
tetrahydrofuran (THF,
= 7) and benzonitrile (
= 26). Although hexamethylphosphoramide
(HMPA,
= 30) is also a frequently used
solvent for electrochemical reduction, extreme
care must be used in handling it because of its
toxicity.
A supporting electrolyte for use in voltammetry
should fulfil the following conditions: (i) it
should be soluble in the solvent under study
and should dissociate into ions to give enough
57

conductivity to the solution, (ii) it should be
resistant to oxidation and reduction, and should
give a wide potential window, and (iii) it should
not have an unfavourable effect on the electrode
reaction to be measured. In addition, the
interaction
between
dissociated
ions
and
intermediates formed by electrode reactions
must
be
taken
into
account.
For
organic
solvents, the commonly used electrolytes are
tetraalkylammonium
salts.
In
general,
tetraethylammonim
ion
(Et4N+)
and
tetrabutylammonium
ion
(Bu4N+)
are
frequently
used
as
the
cation
part
of
tetraalkylammonium salts, while perchlorate
ion
(ClO4−),
tosylate
ion
(TsO−),
tetrafluoroborate
ion
(BF4−)
and
hexafluorophosphate ion (PF6−) are frequently
used as the anion part. Because halide ion (X−)
may be oxidized to form halonium ion (X+), it is
necessary to be careful when using it as the
anion part of the supporting electrolytes. On the
other hand, for aqueous systems, inorganic
salts such as NaCl and KCl, although not
tetraalkylammonium salts, can be employed as
supporting
electrolytes.
In
practice,
the
concentration of supporting electrolytes should
preferably be above 0.1 M.
58

2.5 Cells and Power Sources
The most important decision to be made in
planning voltammetry is whether to use an
undivided cell, in which the working, auxiliary
and reference electrodes are immersed in a
single chamber (Figure 2.3a), or a divided cell,
in which the working and auxiliary electrodes
are in separate compartments (Figure 2.3b) [6].
In making this decision, we have to consider
interference by electrolysis products at the
auxiliary
electrode
in
voltammetric
experiments. If this happens a divided cell must
be used. When the aqueous reference electrode,
such as an Ag/AgCl electrode or SCE, is used in
non-aqueous systems the reference electrode is
also in a separate compartment in order to
prevent
contamination
with
water
(Figure
2.3c), as mentioned in section 2.2. In this case,
a salt bridge is used for the ion-conducting
connection between the working electrode and
reference electrode compartments, and the tip
of
the
salt
bridge
is
dipped
into
the
non-aqueous
solution.
In
addition,
the tip
should be as close as possible to the working
electrode to minimize the iR drop between the
tip and the electrode.
A potentiostat is used as a power supply and is
fundamental
to
voltammetry
using
three-electrode systems [6]. In addition, a wave
generator is necessary for the non-steady state
measurements like cyclic voltammetry (CV).
59

Instrumentation for CV, consisting of both the
wave generator and potentiostat in a single
package,
is
available
from
a
number
of
manufactures. The voltammograms obtained
are output to an X–Y recorder or PC.
2.6 Steady-State and
Non-Steady-States Polarization
Curves
A plot of current density against electrode
potential under a set of constant operating
conditions, known as a polarization curve, is the
standard
electrochemical
technique
for
characterizing the electrode reactions [7]. A
steady-state polarization curve describes the
relationship between the electrode potential
and the current density, which is recorded by
holding the electrode potential and recording
the stable current response. Under vigorous
stirring, the stable current response can be also
obtained by potential scanning measurements
and the diffusion limiting current is dependent
on the potential scan rate. The voltammogram
obtained
in
this
case
corresponds
to
the
steady-state
polarization
curve.
A
non-steady-state
polarization
curve
can
be
obtained at a rapid potential scan rate in the
absence of any convections. However, even
under
still
conditions
a
steady-state
polarization curve may be obtained by using a
slow potential scan since the influence of
60

thermal convection cannot be ignored in this
case.
To evaluate the limiting current density, a
steady-state
polarization
curve
is
usually
measured and the diffusion coefficient (D),
diffusion layer thickness (δ) or the number of
electrons involved in the electrode reaction (n)
can be derived from the measured current
density and Eq. 1.4.
In order to obtain mechanistic information
about
organic
electrochemical
reactions,
non-steady-state polarization curves such as
cyclic and linear sweep voltammograms are
usually measured. CV is the most frequently
used technique in organic electrochemistry, and
hence we will discuss it in more detail below.
In CV, the potential of a stationary electrode is
changed linearly towards increasingly negative
or positive directions until the electrode process
of interest, either a reduction or oxidation,
respectively, takes place, and then the direction
of
the
potential
scan
is
reversed.
This
experiment is capable of providing a great deal
of useful information about the redox potential
of
the
studied
organic
molecules
and
the
relative
rates
of
electron
transfer,
mass
transport and any chemical reactions taking
place at the electrode surface.
Let us now consider the very simple CV for the
redox reaction of ferrocene (Fc). It is well
61

known that the redox reaction of ferrocene is
represented by Eq. 2.1.
(2.1)
Because the Fc is the reduction state in this
redox reaction, the potential should be swept
firstly towards the positive direction (anodic
scan). In this case, the potential scan should
begin
from
the
initial
potential
where
no
current flows (rest potential). In addition, the
scan rate is generally set in the range between
50 and 200 mV s−1. As mentioned in section
2.2, by changing the potential to an electrode
the energy of the Fermi-level is also altered
intentionally.
When
the
potential
is
swept
towards the positive direction from the rest
potential
(process
a–b
of
Figure
2.4;
the
Fermi-level moves to a lower energy), the rate
of
electron
transfer
from
the
HOMO
of
ferrocene to the Fermi-level of the electrode is
dramatically increased and the potential passes
through a mixed region in which the rates of
mass transport and electron transfer both limit
62

the current. When the electron transfer rate is
high enough the currents are purely mass
transfer limited, and a mass-transport-limited
voltammetric peak is observed (Figure 2.4b).
When the final potential is reached (Figure
2.4c), the direction of the potential scan is
reversed (process c–d of Figure 2.4). Since the
Fermi-level moves to a higher energy by doing
this reverse scan, electron transfer from the
Fermi-level to the HOMO of the ferrocenium
ion (Fc+) should occur (the current for Fc+
reduction is observed in this case.). When most
of the Fc+ in the vicinity of the electrode surface
has been converted to Fc, the reduction current
is reduced (process d–a of Figure 2.4).
63

Figure 2.4 Cyclic voltammogram of ferrocene
(Fc)
and
Fermi-level
(EF)

a
metal
electrode along with the HOMO level of Fc in
solution
The form of cyclic voltammogram for ferrocene
redox represents a typical reversible process.
The oxidation peak current ( ) in a reversible
process like a ferrocene redox reaction is:
(2.2)
where n is the number of electrons involved in
the electrode reaction (1 in the case of the
ferrocene redox reaction), cFc and DFc are the
bulk concentration and the diffusion coefficient
of ferrocene, respectively, and v is the potential
scan rate. Thus for a reversible CV wave, the
peak
current
is
proportional
to
the
bulk
concentration of a substrate or the square root
of the potential scan rate.
However,
the
reversible
redox
reaction
is
uncommon in organic electrochemistry since
many organic electrochemical reactions involve
a fast chemical reaction subsequent to electron
transfer (an EC process: the electrode step is E
and the chemical step is C). In this case, the
re-oxidation or re-reduction peak may totally
disappear in the reversal potential scan.
64

2.7 Potentials in Electrochemical
Measurements
In the articles and books dealing with organic
electrode reactions, there are many kinds of
potentials [8,9]. The following six kinds of
potentials are frequently used and hence we will
discuss them:
standard electrode potential
formal potential
peak potential
half-peak potential
half-wave potential
decomposition potential (onset potential).
If we know the standard state free energy
change, ΔGo, for a chemical process, we can
calculate the standard electrode potential, Eo,
for an electrochemical reaction based on that
process using the relationship between ΔGo and
Eo. Thus the Eo is not the experimental value
but the calculated value. Therefore, even if the
electrode potential is measured using the SHE
under an equivalent state, the value measured
will deviate from the real Eo value to a small
degree. The value measured using the SHE
under an equivalent state is termed the formal
65

potential (Eo′). The relationship between Eo
and Eo′ is represented by Eq. 2.3:
(2.3)
where γO and γR are the activity coefficients for
the oxidized and reduced forms of a studied
species. However, the deviation between Eo and
Eo′ is very small in a dilute solution and is
usually
less
than
300
mV
even
in
a
concentrated solution.
The potential at the peak of CV curves is termed
the peak potential. For the reversible redox
reaction, the anodic peak potential (Epa) and
cathodic peak potential (Epc) are independent
of scan rate and concentration, therefore the
peak potentials supply information about the
identity
of
the
substrate
species
and
the
thermodynamic
index
for
the
oxidation/
reduction of the studied species. In addition,
the average value of the anodic and cathodic
peak
potentials
corresponds
to
the
formal
reduction potential (Eo′) for a reversible couple
(Figure 2.5).
66

Figure
2.5
Cyclic
voltammogram
for
a
reversible process
On the other hand, when a relatively fast
chemical
reaction
subsequent
to
electron
transfer is involved in the electrode process, as
indicated in Eqs. 2.4 and 2.5 (EC process), the
peak
potential
shifts
depending
on
the
magnitude of its rate constant (k) and the size
of the back peak in the reverse scan should be
decreased. In this case the peak potentials
cannot be used as the thermodynamic index for
the oxidation/reduction of the studied species.
(2.4)
(2.5)
67

The above discussion concerns voltammograms
recorded
at
a
fixed
potential
scan
rate.
However, if the scan rate is altered we are likely
to observe a variation in the voltammograms
recorded.
For
example,
when
cyclic
voltammograms are recorded at a significantly
faster scan rate (more than 1 V s−1), a reversible
response in CV may be observed due to the time
taken to record the voltammogram. If the
potential scan rate is sufficiently fast it is
possible that no Ox formed according to Eq. 2.4
has had time to chemically react while the
voltammogram is recorded. In this case, we can
estimate a thermodynamic potential such as the
formal potential from the obtained reversible
voltammogram.
Although the half-peak potential (Ep/2) is often
confused with the half-wave potential (E1/2), it
is defined as the potential where the current is
half of the peak current in CV. In addition, the
relationship
between
Ep
and
Ep/2
is
represented by Eq. 2.6:
(2.6)
where n is the number of electrons involved in
the redox electrode reaction. However, Ep/2 is
not an important thermodynamic parameter,
and hence it is not used very much.
The half-wave potential (E1/2) is the potential at
which
the
wave
current
in
steady-state
68

voltammetry is equal to half of the diffusion
limiting current (Figure 2.6a). E1/2 is equal to
the formal potential of the studied electrode
reaction when the reaction is a redox reversible
process and the diffusion coefficients of the
oxidized and reduced forms of a studied species
are equal to each other. However, if the reaction
involves a chemical reaction subsequent to
electron transfer, E1/2 is no longer equal to the

2.8 Utilization of Voltammetry for
the Study of Organic
Electrosynthesis
2.8.1 Voltammetric Analysis for
Selective Electrosynthesis
Many
organic
electrode
processes
are
in
principle multi-pathway, and therefore many
reaction products are usually obtained under
constant-current
electrolysis.
For
example,
constant-current electrolysis for the reduction
of aromatic aldehydes or ketones under acidic
conditions gives two products, such as alcohols
and pinacols, simultaneously (Eq. 2.7) [10,11].
Consider linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for
this
reduction
under
mechanical
stirring
(Figure 2.7). It is known that the first wave
corresponds to one-electron reduction of the
protonated substrate to form the corresponding
radical intermediate, while the second wave
corresponds to a second one-electron reduction
of the radical intermediate to form the alcohol,
as shown in Eq. 2.7. Therefore, when the
potential of the working electrode is maintained
at
potential
(known
as
the
constant-potential
electrolysis),
one-electron
reduction
of
the
carbonyl
compound
will
proceed clearly to the radical intermediate and
consequently
the
pinacol
product
can
be
obtained selectively. If, on the other hand, the
cathode
is
maintained
at
potential
,
a
70

two-electron
reduction
as
well
as
the
one-electron
reduction
will
occur,
and
a
mixture of two products is obtained.
(2.7)
Thus LSV in this process provides information
about the reaction mechanism that allows us to
use the process selectively in synthesis.

2.8.2 Clarification of the Reaction
Mechanism
In general, organic electrode reactions include
several varieties of coupled chemical reactions,
and hence their mechanism is usually complex
compared
to
that
for
inorganic
electrode
reactions. When we undertake a new organic
electrode reaction it is therefore desirable to
conduct CV measurements in advance in order
to understand the mechanism.
A CV experiment conducted by Michielli and
Elving is a good example for clarifying the
complex
reaction
mechanism
[12].
They
employed wave clipping and addition of a
proton donor (phenol) to obtain information
about
intermediates
in
the
electrochemical
reduction of benzophenone (1). As shown in
Figure 2.8a, CV for the reduction gives two
successive cathodic peaks Ic and IIc at −1.8 and
−2.0 V (relative to the Ag/AgNO3 reference
electrode), and a single anodic peak Ia, as the
potential is scanned from 0 to −2.3 V and back
to −1.0 V. Wave clipping, that is, reversal of the
scan direction at a potential (−1.9 V) between
peaks Ic and IIc, causes peak Ia to remain, as
shown in Figure 2.8b. This proves very nicely
that peak Ia is associated with oxidation of the
species formed in the first reduction step (Ic)
and reduction at peak Ic therefore forms a
species that is long lived on the CV time scale.
On the other hand, peak IIc must produce a
72

very
reactive
species
because
it
is
totally
irreversible. Addition of increasing amounts of
phenol to the solution increased the height of
peak Ic and diminished peaks IIc and Ia until
finally peak Ic had doubled in size and peaks IIc
and Ia were no longer evident.
Figure 2.8 Cyclic voltammograms for the
reduction of benzophenone. (a) Potential is
scanned from 0 to −2.3 V and back to −1.0 V.
(b) Potential is scanned from 0 to −1.9 V and
back to −1.0 V
These results are consistent with the following
mechanism:
(2.8)
(2.9)
73

(2.10)
(2.11)
(2.12)
(2.13)
The couple Ic–Ia is associated with reversible
formation of benzophenone ketyl 2 (Eq. 2.8).
Peak IIc should be associated with reduction of
2 to the reactive dianion 3 (Eq. 2.9). In the
presence of phenol, 2 is protonated (Eq. 2.10),
and the resulting radical 4 is then further
reduced to form the monoanion 5 (Eq. 2.12).
Finally 5 is protonated to form the alcohol 6
(Eq. 2.13).
As we have seen in the above example, CV
provides preliminary information about the
mechanism of an unknown electrode reaction.
74

To further clarify the mechanism, we can carry
out the electrochemical reaction on a large
enough
scale
to
permit
the
products
and
intermediates to be isolated and identified. CV
measurements
of
the
products
and
intermediates
isolated
by
preparative
scale
electrolysis may also help us to understand the
mechanism
of
the
studied
electrochemical
reaction. Thus, both CV measurement and
preparative scale electrolysis are absolutely
essential to clarify the complex mechanism of
an unknown organic electrode reaction.
2.8.3 Voltammetry for Selection of
Mediator
Most organic electrode reactions are carried out
by
direct
electrolysis,
that
is,
by
electron
transfer between the organic substrate and the
electrode. On the other hand, by adding a redox
mediator to the medium it is possible to carry
out
electrochemical
reactions
even
at
a
potential where the substance of interest is
electroinactive. In this system, as shown in
Figure 2.9 (this is for the oxidation process, but
exactly analogous behaviour can be observed
for the reduction process), electron interchange
between the mediator MRed (catalyst) and the
electrode generates a substance MOx that can in
turn undergo an electron interchange with the
substrate molecule to give the product. This
kind
of
system
is
called
a
mediated
75

electrocatalytic
reaction
and
the
reaction
becomes an indirect electrolysis [13].
Figure 2.9 Principle of a redox mediatory
reaction. This is for an oxidation process
The features of a mediated electrocatalytic
reaction are as follows:
A catalytic amount of mediator is enough to
carry out indirect electrolysis.
The substrate undergoes a redox conversion
at a potential lower than that required to
effective its direct electrolysis.
Passivation of the electrode as a result of the
formation of non-conductive polymers
during direct electrolysis can be avoided.
Highly selective and efficient redox
conversion can be carried out.
Frequently
used
mediators
for
indirect
electrolyses are multivalent metal ions, halide
ions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as
naphthalene and anthracene, triarylamines and
nitroxyl radicals. In addition, many mediators
76

have been synthesized for specific indirect
electrolyses. In this situation CV measurements
are usually used to select a suitable mediator in
the studied electrochemical reaction.
Since the direct electrochemical oxidation of
alcohols to carbonyl compounds is carried out
with great difficulty, oxidation has been a
favourite testing ground for new electrocatalytic
systems.
Triarylamines
are
well
known
as
excellent
mediators
for
the
indirect
electrochemical oxidation of various alcohols.
For
example,
tris-(p-bromophenyl)amine
exhibits a typical reversible redox response in
CV (Eo′ = 0.8 V vs Ag/AgNO3), as shown in
Figure 2.10a [14]. On the other hand, by adding
4-methoxybenzyl alcohol as a substrate, the
anodic peak increases while the cathodic peak
becomes smaller or disappears (Figure 2.10b).
This
behaviour
suggests
that
tris-(p-bromophenyl)amine can play the role of
mediator and direct electrochemical oxidation
of the substrate can take place smoothly.
However, when benzyl alcohol is added to the
tris-(p-bromophenyl)amine
solution
such
mediatory behaviour is never observed in CV
and a reversible redox response of the amine is
maintained because the oxidation potential of
benzyl alcohol (Epa = 2.0 V vs Ag/AgNO3) is
much higher than that of 4-methoxybenzyl
alcohol (Epa = 1.2 V vs Ag/AgNO3). To observe
mediatory
behaviour
for
benzyl
alcohol
oxidation, a more powerful mediator such as
77

tris-(2,4-dibromophenyl)amine (Eo′ = 1.2 V vs
Ag/AgNO3) is required. Thus CV study is a
powerful tool for selecting a suitable mediator
in this indirect electrochemical reaction.

oxidation of tris-(p-bromophenyl)amine in the
78

absence
and

presence

4-methoxybenzyl alcohol
2.8.4 Voltammetry for Selection of
Electrode Material
As mentioned in section 2.1, the upper and
lower
limits
of
the
potential
window
are
determined by the working electrode material,
and hence the selection of a working electrode
material is critical not only to experimental
success
for
voltammetry
but
also
smooth
progress
of
the
desired
preparative
scale
electrolysis.
Although the electrochemical oxidation of furan
in
methanol
solution
usually
gives
the
corresponding methoxylated product, as shown
in Eq. 2.14, the desired oxidation proceeds
inefficiently at the Pt electrode. On the other
hand, an excellent yield of product can be
obtained by using a glassy carbon (GC) working
electrode.
The
influence
of
the
working
electrode material on the efficiency of the
electrochemical reaction can also be confirmed
by the CV study [15].
(2.14)
79

Figures
2.11a
and
2.11b
show
cyclic
voltammograms for the oxidation of furan in
methanol solution recorded at GC and Pt
anodes, respectively. An oxidation peak for
furan can be observed at a very positive
potential of 1.9 V vs. SCE using the GC plate as
the anode. In contrast, when the Pt plate is used
as the anode material, methanol solvent is
discharged more easily, a high background
current is recorded and therefore no oxidation
peak for the oxidation of furan is observed. It
can
therefore
be
stated
from
the
CV
experiments
that
GC
is
the
better
anode
material for the oxidation of furan.

As
we
have

in
the
above
example,
voltammograms
measured
in
this
process
provide
preliminary
information
about
a
80

suitable electrode material that will allow us to
use the process efficiently in synthesis.

Toshio Fuchigami
Organic electrosynthesis is generally affected by
more complicated factors than ordinary organic
synthesis therefore we must choose suitable
electrolytic
cells
(divided
or
undivided),
electrolytic
methods
(constant
current
or
constant
potential),
electrodes,
supporting
electrolytes, solvents and so on [1–5]. In this
chapter, the detail is described so that even
beginners will be able to carry out organic
electrosynthesis.
3.1 Selection of Electrolytic Cells
A proper choice of cell design is important in
performing the desired electrolytic reaction.
Organic electrolytic reactions are achieved on a
laboratory scale by using an undivided cell. The
simplest cell design is shown in Figure 3.1, but a
cylindrical cell, shown in Figure 3.2, is the
recommended
design
when
anhydrous
conditions or electrolysis under an inert gas
atmosphere, like nitrogen, is required. In an
inert gas atmosphere the solvent and substrate
are injected by syringe into the cell through a
rubber septum.
84

Figure 3.1 Beaker-type cell
85

Figure
3.2
Undivided
cell
for
anhydrous
electrolysis
When a species reduced at a cathode is oxidized
at an anode, and vice versa, a two-compartment
cell, namely a divided cell with a diaphragm
(sintered glass or an ion-exchange membrane),
should be used to prevent mixing of the anodic
and cathodic solutions. An H-type cell divided
with a sintered glass diaphragm (pore size φ =
5–10 μm) is convenient, as shown in Figure 3.3.
A suitable volume for each compartment is
10–200
cm3,
and
the
diameter
of
the
diaphragm should be as large as possible to
decrease the cell resistance. When starting
substrate
and/or
products
migrate
to
a
counter-compartment through a sintered glass
86

diaphragm, an ion-exchange membrane should
be used instead of the diaphragm. In this case, a
separable
cell
in
which
the
membrane
is
sandwiched between the compartments using
screws is recommended. Such separable divided
cells
are
commercially
available.
When
a
diaphragm is used, the cell resistance usually
increases and consequently the cell voltage (the
voltage
between
the
anode
and
cathode)
increases. To decrease the cell voltage, the
distance between the electrodes should be kept
as small as possible.

cell

87

Even when a divided cell is necessary for
cathodic reduction, we can achieve the desired
reduction using an undivided cell as follows.
Use of sacrificial anodes like Mg and Zn or
addition of sacrificial organic compounds like
oxalic acid and acetic acid to the electrolytic
solution
enables
re-oxidation
of
cathodic
products to be avoided. In the former case the
anode metals are dissolved as metal ions in the
solution during the electrolysis, while in the
latter case the acids are anodically oxidized to
form
CO2
and
ethane.
Such
sacrificial
electrolytic
systems
enable
oxidation
of
cathodic products and the starting material at
the anode to be avoided. On the other hand, in
the case of anodic oxidation requiring a divided
cell, a proton source should be added as a
sacrificial
substance
into
the
electrolytic
solution
and
cathode
materials
with
low
hydrogen overpotential should be used. In this
case, proton reduction at the cathode takes
place
preferentially,
which
enables
the
reduction of anodic products and the starting
material
at
the
cathode
to
be
avoided.
Consequently,
we
can
achieve
the
desired
anodic
oxidation
selectively
even
in
an
undivided cell.
Crucibles made of conducting materials like
graphite and glassy carbon can be used as
working electrodes. In this case, the volume of
electrolytic solution can be reduced and the
88

surface area of the working electrode can be
increased.
For scaling up for commercialization a filter
press type flow cell is recommended, as shown
in Figure 3.4. In this case, the volume of the
electrolytic solution has no limit since the
solution is circulated by pump, and mass
transport from the bulk to the surface of the
working electrode is promoted to increase the
efficiency of the electrolytic reaction.
Figure 3.4 Filter press type flow cell
3.2 Constant Current Electrolysis
and Constant Potential
Electrolysis
It is recommended that organic electrosynthesis
be carried out at a constant current at first
because the setup of the electrolytic system and
the operation of the power supply are simple.
The
product
selectivity
and
yield
can
be
89

improved by controlling current density and the
amount of electricity passed. Since current
density
is
correlated
to
applied
potential,
changing the current density creates a potential
shift. The current density should be selected
depending on the concentration of the starting
substrate.
When
the
concentration
of
the
substrate is low, the current density should be
low and vice versa. The electricity passed is
readily calculated according to the following
equation: current (A) × time (s) = electricity
(C). For instance, when the desired electrolytic
reaction
is
a
two-electron
reaction,
the
theoretical amount of electricity is 2 F (2 ×
96480 C). When this electricity is divided by
applied current (A), one can easily calculate for
how many hours the electrolysis must be
carried out. As shown in Figure 3.5a, the
electrode
potential
changes
with
the
consumption of the starting substrate (positive
shift in case of oxidation or negative shift in
case
of
reduction),
therefore
the
product
selectivity and current efficiency sometimes
decrease,
particularly
in
the
late
stage
of
electrolysis.
However,
highly
selective
and
efficient organic electrosynthesis can often be
achieved even at constant current electrolysis,
hence commercialized electrode processes are
operated
mainly
by
constant
current
electrolysis. Nevertheless, a constant potential
electrolysis
is
suitable
for
achieving
high
selectivity and clarification of the reaction
mechanisms.
Moreover,
based
on
constant
90

potential coulometry, one can easily find the
number of electrons involved in the electrolytic
reaction.
In
order
to
carry
out
constant
potential electrolysis, the oxidation potential or
reduction potential of the substrate should be
measured in advance, but one can estimate the
applied
potential
at
which
rapid
current
increase is observed from a current-potential
curve of the substrate. As shown in Figure 3.6, a
salt bridge terminated either by a Luggin
capillary or a plug of porous Vycor glass is
placed closed to the working electrode, and an
appropriate constant potential relative to a
reference electrode such as an aqueous SCE is
applied using a potentiostat. The amount of
electricity passed is measured by a coulometer.

3.3 Direct Electrolysis and
Indirect Electrolysis
Electrolysis is classified as direct electrolysis or
indirect electrolysis. The former is based on
direct
electron
transfer
between
substrate
molecule and electrode, which is a simple and
common
electrolytic
method.
The
latter
is
based
on
electron
transfer
using
redox
mediators dissolved in an electrolytic solvent,
as shown in Figure 3.7 (indirect cathodic
reduction). (Note that indirect anodic oxidation
is covered in Chapter 2, Figure 2.9.) Indirect
electrolysis is also classified into in-cell, where
electrolysis is carried out in the presence of
92

both substrate and mediator, and ex-cell, where
electrolysis is used for only regeneration of the
mediator.
In
the
former
case,
the
redox
potential of the mediator should be lower than
that of the substrate. When the redox potential
of the mediator is higher than that of the
substrate, the latter type is employed. In the
former case a catalytic amount of mediator
should be enough, while in the latter case a
quantitative or excess amount of mediator is
necessary. When the heterogeneous electron
transfer between mediator and electrode, as
well as the redox reaction with the substrate, is
fast
enough
(Figure
3.7b),
a
significantly
enhanced catalytic current can be obtained due
to decreased electrolysis potential (decreased
activation energy), as shown in Figure 3.8. In
other word, a large electrocatalytic current can
be obtained.
Figure 3.7 Principle of indirect electrolysis
using a mediator
93

Figure 3.8 Current potential curve for direct
and indirect electrolysis
The
characteristics
and
proper
choice
of
mediators and their synthetic applications are
described in Chapters 2 and 4, respectively.
Many types of mediators are available and the
redox potentials of mediators can be tuned by
their
molecular
design.
Moreover,
some
mediators can be applied to electrochemical
asymmetric synthesis [6–9].
3.4 Electrode Materials and
Reference Electrodes
The choice of electrode material is one of the
most important factors in electrolysis since the
material is not only the interface for electron
transfer with the substrate molecule but also
acts
as
an
electrocatalyst.
If
the
correct
94

electrode material is not chosen, the desired
electrolytic reaction does not proceed, therefore
a suitable electrode material must be selected
carefully. In an aqueous solution, oxygen gas
and hydrogen gas are generated competitively
due to discharge of water during the electrolytic
reaction. In order to avoid such undesirable
reactions,
cathode
materials
with
high
hydrogen overpotential or anode materials with
high oxygen overpotential should be used. The
order of oxygen overpotential is Au > Pt, Pd,
Cd, Ag > PbO2 > Cu > Fe > Co > Ni, and the
order of hydrogen overvoltage is Hg > Zn, Pb,
Cd > graphite > Cu > Fe, Ni > Ag, Co > Pt, Pd. A
mercury
cathode
was
very
often
used
for
electroreductive organic synthesis, but it is no
longer
used
except
for
electrochemical
measurements
because
of
its
toxicity.
A
platinum electrode is the first choice in aprotic
organic solvents. Although various kinds of
cathode materials are available, usable anode
materials are limited. Most metals are easily
oxidized apart from noble metals like platinum
and gold. Carbon, graphite and metal oxides
like PbO2 are commonly used as anodes.
Carbon electrodes generally include a trace
amount of metals like iron, therefore their
surface is paramagnetic. Hence, such carbon
anodes
easily
capture
anodically
generated
radicals to enhance further oxidation to form
cationic intermediates. On the other hand,
platinum anodes generally tend to generate
95

radical intermediates selectively. Accordingly,
platinum anodes are most suitable for Kolbe
electrolysis. It should be noted that when a
carbon anode is used in a solution containing
LiClO4, collapse of the electrode surface often
takes place due to the oxidation of binder such
as coal tar pitch in the carbon electrode. In
sharp contrast, glassy carbon (GC) electrodes
have enough durability for anodic oxidation,
and anode passivation does not occur, which is
quite different from other carbon electrodes.
However, GC electrodes are costly, as are
platinum
electrodes.
Although
non-precious-metal electrodes are not suitable
for anode materials, Mg, Zn, Al and Cu are
often used as reactive electrodes or sacrificial
anodes, as explained in section 3.1.
The following points should be noted when
organic
electrosynthesis
is
carried
out.
In
contrast
to
electrochemical
measurements,
electrochemical synthesis requires a relatively
large current of 10–100 mA (∼10 mA cm−2)
even on a laboratory scale. The use of a larger
electrode
surface
area
is
therefore
recommended to complete the electrolysis in a
shorter time. As working electrode shape, plate,
candy stick (baculiform) and mesh type are
commonly used. The surface area of the counter
electrode should be same as that of the working
electrode. Depending on the kind of electrodes,
pre-treatment of the electrode surface differs,
96

but in general the electrode surface is polished
with alumina abrasive or emery papers.
Reference
electrodes
are
required
when
measurement of current potential curves and
constant potential electrolysis are carried out.
When aqueous and protic solvents are used as
electrolytic solvents, a SCE (Figure 2.2a) and a
silver–silver
chloride
(Ag/AgCl)
electrode
(Figure 2.2b) should be used. For electrolysis in
non-aqueous solution, an Ag/Ag+ reference
electrode is convenient since it can be placed
near the working electrode surface without a
salt bridge. Reference electrodes are described
in further detail in Chapter 2.
3.5 Electrolytic Solvents and
Supporting Electrolytes
Electrolytic solvents must have polarity, which
allows supporting electrolytes to be dissolved to
dissociate
ions
and
provide
sufficient
ion
conductivity for the electrolytic solutions. The
index of solvent polarity is reflected by its
dielectric constant, and electrolytic solvents
should have low viscosity and toxicity. In
particular, it should be noted that solvent
viscosity strongly affects diffusion of substrate
from bulk to electrode surface.
97

3.6 Stirring
Since
electrolytic
reactions
are
typically
heterogeneous,
stirring
of
an
electrolytic
solution controls mass transport of substrate,
which greatly affects current efficiency and
product
selectivity.
Even
if
a
solution
is
vigorously stirred, the transport of the substrate
from bulk to the electrode surface is not always
enhanced. As shown in Figure 3.4, circulation
of an electrolytic solution through a flow cell,
particularly a filter press type cell, is much
more efficient compared to a conventional
beaker type cell, hence the filter press type cell
is usually employed in industrial electrolysis.
3.7 Tracking of Reactant and
Product
Efficient conversion of substrate to desired
product is very important in organic synthesis.
In the case of constant current electrolysis,
discharge
of
solvent
and/or
supporting
electrolyte takes place simultaneously at a later
stage of the electrolysis. A theoretical amount of
charge
passed
is
not
always
enough
for
complete
substrate
conversion,
hence
monitoring
electrolysis
(consumption
of
starting substrate and amount of product)
should be carried out using TLC, GC, HPLC or
mass spectrometry (MS) to confirm substrate
conversion.
98

3.8 Work-Up, Isolation and
Determination of Products
Work-up of electrolysis is similar to ordinary
organic synthesis, but the following points
should be noted.
Since the anolyte becomes acidic and the
catholyte becomes basic after electrolysis
using a divided cell, neutralization of the
desired electrolytic solution should be done.
Since a large amount of supporting
electrolyte is contained in the electrolytic
solution, its removal should be done first.
For example, when the electrolytic solvent is
water soluble, the solvent must be removed
by evaporation under reduced pressure. The
remaining residue or water-insoluble
electrolytic solution is mixed with water or
brine (saturated NaCl aqueous solution), if
necessary, neutralization is performed and
the product is extracted with appropriate
organic solvents like diethyl ether. It should
be noted that some hydrophobic supporting
electrolytes like Bu4NBF4 are insoluble in
water, but soluble in organic solvents like
CH2Cl2.
Isolation
and
identification
techniques
are
similar to those in ordinary organic synthesis.
Product
isolation
is
carried
out
using
distillation, recrystallization or various types of
chromatography,
and
identification
is
99

performed using various spectroscopic analysis
methods such as 1H NMR, IR and MS.
3.9 Current Efficiency and Effect
of the Power Unit
Current efficiency is the most important factor
for
evaluating
the
results
of
electrolytic
reactions. For instance, consider the following
two-electron reduction of acetone:
(3.1)
Electricity of 2 × 96,480 C is required for the
formation of 1 mol of isopropyl alcohol. When n
mol of isopropyl alcohol is formed from 1 mol of
acetone after passing Q coulombs, the current
efficiency (%) is (96,480 × 2n/Q) × 100.
Current efficiency is usually below 100% since
the
solvent
and/or
supporting
salt
are
discharged
simultaneously
during
the
electrolytic reaction.
The energy consumption for electrosynthesis is
usually disregarded in basic research, but it is
the
most
important
factor
in
industrial
electrolytic processes. The energy consumption
for
the
production
of
the
desired
organic
compound is shown as kWh kg−1, which greatly
depends
on
cell
voltage,
therefore
it
is
100

recommended
that
the
distance
between
electrodes should be kept as small as possible to
decrease cell resistance.

Methods for Organic Electrosynthesis

Toshio Fuchigami
In
this
chapter,
the
general
features
of
electrolytic reactions and differences between
electrolytic reactions and ordinary chemical
ones will be explained. Typical characteristics
such as umpolung (polarity inversion) and
selectivity
control
together
with
electron
transfer control are discussed. Reaction types
and
various
electrochemically
generated
reactive species will also be explained [1–6].
4.1 General Characteristics of
Electrode Reactions
Organic electrode reactions have the following
features, many of which cannot be achieved by
other methods:
Electrode reactions are typically
heterogeneous reactions, and the reaction
fields are specific since oxidation and
reduction take place separately at different
fields.
Umpolung (polarity inversion) is readily
performed without the use of any reagents.
The selectivity of electrode reactions is often
different from that of ordinary organic
reactions.
104

Since electrons are used as a reagent, the
use of hazardous reagents can be avoided,
i.e. electrode reactions are low-emission
processes.
Electrode reactions proceed under mild
conditions such as room temperature and
normal pressure.
Electrode reactions can be started or
stopped readily by on-off switch of the
power supply, i.e. electrode reaction control
is easy.
The scale effect is generally small.
Electrode reactions are redox reactions through
electron transfer between a substrate molecule
and an electrode. The main reaction field is an
electrode surface (solid–liquid interface) or
near the electrode surface, and the surface has
an extremely large electrical field, which is quite
different from ordinary redox reactions on
heterogeneous
catalysts.
Electrode
reactions
therefore take place in highly unique fields.
Using a chemical redox reaction as an example,
the difference between an ordinary chemical
reaction and an electrode reaction will be
explained in detail. Figure 4.1a shows the
reduction of substrate B by reducing reagent A.
When an activated complex is formed or A and
B approach each other closely enough for
electron transfer, electron transfer from A to B
takes place. Next, reductant A is transformed to
105

oxidized C while substrate B is transformed to
reduced
product
D.
The
former
electron
transfer
through
the
complex
is
called
inner-sphere
electron
transfer
or
bonded
electron transfer, while the latter one without
any complex is called outer-sphere electron
transfer or non-bonded electron transfer. Thus,
both oxidation and reduction occur at the same
place in the case of an ordinary chemical
reaction, while oxidation and reduction occur at
different places, such as an anode and cathode,
respectively, in the case of an electrochemical
reaction (Figure 4.1b). In other words, electrode
electron transfer takes place separately due to
the existence of the electrode interfaces, which
is a significant characteristic feature that is
different from ordinary chemical reactions.

between
chemical
reaction (a) and electrochemical reaction (b)

4.2 Mechanism of Organic
Electrode Reactions
In the case of organic electrode reactions,
electron transfer generally does not take place
cleanly, and pre and/or post reactions usually
accompany the transfer. This is quite different
from inorganic electrode reactions. An organic
electrode
reaction
consists
of
an
electron
transfer step as well as several chemical and
physical steps.
Figure 4.2 illustrates each elementary reaction
step of substrate S forming product P via
intermediate I. In step (a), mass transport of S
from the bulk of an electrolytic solution to the
electrode surface takes place by diffusion or
migration. In step (b), pre-reactions such as
desolvation, dissociation and/or deprotonation
of
S
take
place
to
form
intermediate
I.
However, such pre-reactions do not always take
place. In step (c), the intermediate I adsorbs on
the
surface
of
the
electrode
to
form
intermediate Iad. In step (d), electron transfer
between
Iad
and
an
electrode
generates
intermediate I′ad. In step (e), desorption of I′ad
followed by subsequent chemical reaction (f)
proceeds to provide a product P that diffuses to
the bulk of the electrolytic solution, and then
the
sequential
reaction
is
completed.
Intermediate
I
may
undergo
an
electron
transfer reaction without an adsorption step (c)
and also the order of sequential steps (e) and (f)
107

may be reversed, i.e. I′ad undergoes subsequent
reaction and then desorption of the resulting
product occurs. Thus, the electrode reaction is
typical in a heterogeneous system, and mass
transfer steps (a) and (g) as well as adsorption
and desorption steps (c) and (e) are involved,
which is quite different from homogeneous
reactions.
Figure 4.2 Elementary processes of electrode
reactions
If
the
electrode
process
(electron
transfer
process) is abbreviated to E and the chemical
process
is
abbreviated
to
C,
the
organic
electrode reaction can be shown using these
abbreviations. For example, the electrochemical
108

reaction illustrated in Figure 4.2 can be shown
by the sequence CEC (pre-chemical reaction →
electrode
process
→
follow-up
chemical
reaction), and adsorption and desorption steps
are
usually
disregarded
unless
they
are
important.
In order to clarify the reaction mechanism,
electrochemical analyses such as coulometry
and
voltammetry
in
addition
to
ordinary
organic mechanistic studies are necessary to
obtain information such as the number of
electrons
transferred,
redox
potentials
and
detection of the reaction intermediates. The
details of the electrochemical analyses are
described in Chapters 2 and 3.
4.3 Characteristics of Organic
Electrolytic Reactions
4.3.1 Umpolung
The polarity inversion of chemical bonding can
be readily carried out in electrolytic reactions
[6].
In
other
words,
electrophiles
can
be
converted
electrochemically
to
nucleophiles
without use of any reagents, and vice versa.
Such polarity inversion is widely used for
organic synthesis. For example, alkyl halides
are inherently electrophilic reagents. In order to
convert them to nucleophilic reagents, they
have to be transformed to Grignard reagents or
lithium compounds using Mg or Li metal.
109

However, such polarity inversion (umpolung)
can be readily achieved in one step by cathodic
reduction of the alkyl halides, as shown in Eq.
4.1. When the basic products are isolated after
Grignard
reaction,
the
work
up
can
be
troublesome, and it may be rather difficult to
separate the product from aqueous alkaline
solution due to insoluble Mg(OH)2. In sharp
contrast, in the case of electrolytic reactions,
the product isolation is rather easy and the
severe waste problem does not occur because
there
is
no
use
of
metals.
In
addition,
electrolytic
reactions
do not
require
easily
flammable ethereal solvents, and alternative
solvents
like
acetonitrile
can
be
used
as
electrolytic solvents.
(4.1)
When alkyl substituents are introduced to
phosphine, silicon and stannum compounds,
their corresponding chloro compounds (R3ZCl,
R2PCl) and alkyl Grignard reagents are usually
used. However, electrochemical reduction of
these chloro compounds generates the anionic
intermediates, which can readily react with
alkyl
halides
(R′X)
to
provide
the
corresponding alkyl-substituted products (Eq.
4.2).
(4.2)
110

Allylsilanes usually react with electrophiles, but
their electrochemical oxidation generates allylic
cations, which react with nucleophiles as shown
in Eq. 4.3.
(4.3)
Electron-rich benzene derivatives usually react
with electrophiles, while they can react with
nucleophiles by electrochemical oxidation (Eq.
4.4).
(4.4)
Furthermore,
industrialized
electroreductive
hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile, shown in
Eq. 4.5, is also a typical example of umpolung
using cathodic reduction.
(4.5)
4.3.2 Selectivity
The selectivity of electrolytic reactions is rather
complicated since it is controlled by many
111

factors, such as electrode materials, applied
potential, current density, electrolytic solvents,
supporting
electrolytes,
electric
field,
adsorption
orientation
of
substrate
or
intermediate species at the electrode surface
and so on [4–7]. Heterogeneous electrolytic
reactions
therefore
often
exhibit
different
selectivity
from
ordinary
homogeneous
chemical reactions. In particular, when an
electrochemically generated reactive species or
intermediate reacts with reagents before it
diffuses from the electrode into the solution,
the stereo- and regioselectivities of the product
are often quite different from those of ordinary
chemical reactions. Typical examples of the
selectivity of electrode reactions are described
in the following sections.
4.3.2.1 Chemoselectivity
Chemoselectivity in ordinary chemical reactions
is controlled by the choice of reagents, but it is
quite difficult to achieve high chemoselectivity
when multiple similar functional groups exist in
a
single
molecule.
On
the
other
hand,
chemoselectivity can be achieved by the control
of applied potential based on the difference
between the redox potentials of functional
groups. Since the applied potential is adjusted
precisely using a potentiostat, high selectivity
can be readily achieved. For instance, even
though phenylimino and alkylimino groups
exist in the same molecule, as shown in Eq. 4.6,
112

the phenylimino group can be predominantly
reduced by constant potential electrolysis. This
is because the phenylimino group is more easily
reduced than the alkylimino group as a result of
the
electron-withdrawing
phenyl
group.
However, such selective reduction cannot be
achieved by ordinary reducing reagents.
(4.6)
Similarly, in the case of the molecule with three
halogen atoms shown in Eq. 4.7, the halogen
atom at the α-position to the carbonyl group is
most easily reducible, thereby this halogen can
be predominantly reduced at constant potential
electrolysis.
(4.7)
4.3.2.2 Reaction Pathway Selectivity
It is known that the reaction pathway is greatly
changed depending on applied potentials. As
shown
in
Eq.
4.8,
one-electron
and
two-electron reduction products are obtained
113

selectively depending on the applied cathode
potentials.
(4.8)
4.3.2.3 Regioselectivity
(a) Kinetically Controlled and
Thermodynamically Controlled
Regioselectivity
Regioselectivity is often controlled by either the
stability
of
a
reactive
intermediate
(thermodynamic control) or the reaction rate of
an intermediate with a reagent as well as the
elimination rate of a leaving group (kinetic
control). As a typical example of the former, it is
well known that anodic benzylic substitutions
easily take place and are attributable to a stable
benzylic cation intermediate.
On
the
other
hand,
when
N,N-dimethylbezylamine is anodically oxidized
in methanol, a methoxy group is selectively
introduced to the methyl group, as shown in
Figure 4.3 [8]. This regioselectivity is not
controlled
by
the
stability
of
the
cationic
intermediate,
i.e.
this
reaction
is
not
114

thermodynamically
controlled.
Since
the
anodically
generated
radical
cation
intermediate seems to be adsorbed on the
anode, deprotonation takes place preferentially
from
a
less
hindered
methyl
group.
Consequently,
this
reaction
is
kinetically
controlled.
Figure
4.3
Regioselective
anodic
methoxylation
In a similar manner, anodic methoxylation of
N-ethyl-N-methylaniline,
the
corresponding
carbamate, and amide derivatives also takes
place at the methyl group selectively (Eq. 4.9)
[9].
(4.9)
However,
the
regioselectivity
can
also
be
explained by the difference in deprotonation
rates of radical cation intermediates (so-called
kinetic acidity [10]). For example, in the case of
anodic methoxylation of an aniline derivative
115

having a N-fluoroalkyl (Rf) group and an
N-alkyl
group,
as
shown
in
Figure
4.4,
methoxylation
takes
place
at
the
adjacent
position to the Rf group preferentially. The
regioselectivity increases with an increase in the
electron-withdrawing ability of the Rf group,
i.e. the selectivity increases in the following
order: CH3 < CH2F < CHF2 < CF3 [9]. The
mechanism for this regioselectivity outcome is
called kinetic control.
Figure 4.4 Mechanism of regioselective anodic
methoxylation (kinetic control)
The regioselectivity of electrolytic fluorination
is
also
controlled
by
kinetic
acidity.
For
example,
in
the
case
of
electrochemical
fluorination
of
heterocyclic
compounds,
as
shown
in
Eq.
4.10,
fluorination
proceeds
predominantly
via
the
unstable
cation
intermediate adjacent to the carbonyl group
rather than via the stable benzylic cation. This
can be explained in terms of enhanced facile
deprotonation
of
the
anodically
generated
116

radical
cation
by
an
electron-withdrawing
carbonyl group [10–12].
(4.10)
(b) Regioselectivity Controlled by Selective
Adsorption of a Substrate to an Electrode
due to its Dipole Moment
As shown in Figure 4.5, tetrachloropicolinic
acid
is
regioselectively
dechlorinated
by
cathodic reduction. The high regioselectivity is
attributed to the controlled orientation of the
substrate at the cathode surface owing to the
dipole moment of the molecule [13].

dechlorination
117

4.3.2.4 Stereoselectivity
(a) Stereoselectivity Controlled by Selective
Adsorption of Reactive Intermediate to
Electrode
As shown in Figure 4.6, the lithium salt of an
unsaturated amine derivative adsorbs on the
anode
due
to
coulombic
interactions.
One-electron
transfer
then
takes
place
to
generate
the
corresponding
aminyl
radical
intermediate,
which
undergoes
subsequent
intramolecular
cyclization
in
an
adsorbed
manner
or
near
the
anode
to
result
in
predominant
formation
of
the
thermodynamically less stable cis-form product
[14].
Interestingly,
in
this
reaction
the
thermodynamically
favoured
trans-form
product is not generated at all.
Figure 4.6 Stereoselective anodic cyclization
On the other hand, a similar reaction using a
chemical
oxidant
such
as
HgCl2
provides
mainly the thermodynamically favourable trans
product.
Such
high
stereoselectivity
in
electrochemical reactions is mainly attributable
to the adsorption effect. Thus, it can be stated
that
the
electrode
contributes
greatly
to
118

stereocontrol.
In
the
cases
of
cathodic
hydrogenation and anodic addition of cyclic
olefins, cis-form products are preferentially
formed. This is also attributable to addition of
protons and nucleophiles to the anionic and
cationic
intermediates
adsorbed
on
the
electrode, respectively.
(b) Stereoselectivity Controlled by Steric
Hindrance between Substrate and Electrode
Simple
stereocontrol
is
achieved
by
steric
hindrance between substrate and electrode. As
we can easily see in Figure 4.7, the orientation
of bicyclic gem-dibromocyclopropane at the
cathode surface as shown in (a) is favoured over
that of the substrate shown in (b) owing to
steric repulsion between the cathode and the 6-
or 8-membered ring fused to cyclopropane.
Therefore, the exo-bromide near the cathode is
more easily reducible than the endo-bromide,
and consequently the endo-bromide product is
mainly formed [15].
119

Figure 4.7 Stereoselective reduction based on
orientation of substrate on the cathode
4.3.2.5 Selectivity Depending on Electrode
Materials
There are many examples of electrode materials
that
greatly
affect
product
selectivity
and
stereoselectivity.
(a) Product Selectivity
Acetone is reduced at a lead cathode in an
acidic
aqueous
solution
to
give
the
corresponding alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, while
the reduction with zinc and copper cathodes
provides the corresponding alkane, propane
[16].
120

(b) Anode Material Dependence of Kolbe
Electrolysis
It is well known that Kolbe electrolysis with a
platinum
anode
generates
a
radical
intermediate, while that with a carbon anode
generates a cationic intermediate [1].
(c) Stereoselectivity
The reduction of 2-methylcyclohexanone at zinc
and copper cathodes in aqueous NaOH solution
provides
mainly
the
corresponding
trans-alcohol, while that with a tin cathode
provides cis-alcohol as a major product [17].
4.4 Molecular Orbitals and
Electrons Related to Electron
Transfer
The electrons involved in electrode electron
transfer are not characteristic of electrolysis.
From the viewpoint of molecular orbitals, the
oxidation process can be explained by electron
transfer from the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) of a substrate molecule to the
anode, while the reduction process is explained
by electron transfer from the cathode to the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of
a substrate, as shown in Figure 4.8 [18].
121

Figure
4.8
Molecular-orbital
diagram
for
electron transfer
In the case of a hydrocarbon, electron transfer
takes
place
from
unsaturated
bonds
and
σ-bonds
of
strained
compounds
like
cyclopropane
or
ionic
species.
However,
ordinary
saturated
hydrocarbons
rarely
undergo redox reactions. On the other hand,
even in the cases of saturated heteroatom
compounds containing heteroatoms like N, S
and O atoms, their oxidation is rather easy
since
electron
transfer
from
lone
paired
electrons of a heteroatom readily takes place.
Furthermore, depending on the heteroatom (Z),
C–Z and Z–Z bonds can be reductively cleaved.
Isolated olefins are generally difficult to oxidize,
but olefins with a directly attached heteroatom,
for instance enamines, enol ethers and silyl enol
ethers (Figure 4.9), are electron-rich olefins,
therefore their oxidation potentials decrease
significantly
and
they
are
easily
oxidized.
Moreover, heteroatoms greatly contribute to
122

the
stability
of
electrochemically
generated
adjacent reactive intermediates, as shown in
Figure
4.10.
These
effects
are
important
characteristic
properties
of
heteroatom
compounds.

4.5 Electroauxiliaries
Electroauxiliaries are functional groups that
facilitate
electron
transfer
and
control
the
reaction pathways of electrogenerated reactive
species
to
provide
the
desired
products
selectively.
Synthetic
applications
of
electroauxiliaries
in
anodic
oxidation
are
widespread while those for cathodic reduction
are rare [18].
123

4.5.1 Electroauxiliaries Based on
Molecular Orbital Interactions
The orbital interaction is highly effective in
increasing the HOMO level. In principle, the
interaction of the HOMO with a high-energy
filled orbital increases its energy level. For
instance, the energy level of a C–Si σ orbital is
generally much higher than that of C–H and
C–C σ orbitals therefore the C–Si σ orbital
interacts
effectively
with
a
non-bonding
p
orbital of a heteroatom like N, O or S (σ–n
interaction) if two orbitals align in the same
plane (Figure 4.11) [18,19]. Accordingly, a silyl
group at the α position activates a heteroatom
compound
towards
anodic
oxidation.
One-electron oxidation gives the radical cation,
in which the C–Si σ orbital interacts with a
half-vacant p orbital of the heteroatom to
stabilize
the
system.
Such
interaction
also
weakens the C–Si bond, and hence the C–Si
bond is cleaved selectively. The resulting carbon
radical undergoes further oxidation to give the
carbocation, which is trapped by a nucleophile
to give the desired product (Eq. 4.11). Thus, the
silyl group not only activates substrates towards
oxidation
but
also
controls
the
reaction
pathway [18,19].
124

(4.11)
Figure 4.11 Interaction between the C–Si s
orbital and the non-bonding 2p orbital of an
oxygen atom to increase the HOMO level
In general, the electroauxiliary effect of a silyl
group increases S < N < O, and the oxidation
potential
of
a
silyl
compound
with
an
α
heteroatom decreases in the same order, as
shown in Figure 4.12. In other words, the
magnitude of the silicon effect for oxygen
compounds is much greater than that for
organo nitrogen and sulfur compounds. This is
125

in
accord
with
the
better
overlap
of
the
non-bonding p orbital of oxygen with the C–Si
σ orbital than that of the orbitals of nitrogen
and sulfur [18,20,21].
Figure 4.12 Example of decrease in oxidation
potentials
owing
to
molecular
orbital
interaction
The interaction of the C–Si σ orbital is also
effective for raising the energy level of the
adjacent π systems (σ–π interaction), and the
C–Si bond is cleaved selectively. The silyl group
therefore serves as an electroauxiliary for the
oxidation of π systems. A stannyl group also
serves
as
an
electroauxiliary
for
the
electrochemical
oxidation
of
heteroatom
compounds and π systems [18].
The anodic cyanation of N-benzyl-substituted
piperizines usually provides a mixture of two
126

regioisomeric
products.
However,
the
introduction
of
a
silyl
group
as
an
electroauxiliary directs the reaction pathway to
form a single product, as shown in Eq. 4.12
[22].
The
silyl
group
also
decreases
the
oxidation potential of the amine.
(4.12)
4.5.2 Electroauxiliaries Based on
Readily Electron-Transferable
Functional Groups
Easily oxidizable functional groups like the
arylthio
(ArS)
group
also
work
as
electroauxiliaries, i.e. the introduction of an ArS
group
at
the
α
position
of
ethers
and
carbamates
decreases
their
oxidation
potentials. Importantly, the oxidation of α-ArS
substituted heteroatom compounds results in
the selective cleavage of the C–S bond to
generate a cation intermediate stabilized by the
adjacent
heteroatom.
The
resulting
cation
intermediate
reacts
with
a
nucleophile
to
provide the product selectively. The use of an
ArS group as an electroauxiliary expands the
scope of nucleophiles, which enables in situ use
127

of carbon nucleophiles like allylsilane, as shown
in Eqs. 4.13 and 4.14, even if such nucleophiles
are easily oxidized [23]. In these cases, owing to
the ArS group, selective C–S bond cleavage
takes place and an allyl group is introduced to
the α or benzylic carbon selectively.
(4.13)
(4.14)
On the other hand, it is known that the
electroauxiliary moiety and reactive site are
different in the case of cathodic reduction. For
instance, as shown in Eq. 4.15, the first electron
transfer takes place at the easily electron
acceptable carbonyl group, and then adjacent
carbon–heteroatom bond cleavage takes place
selectively [24].
128

(4.15)
Based on this principle, selective C–O bond
cleavage at the benzylic and allylic positions can
be easily achieved, as shown in Eq. 4.16.
(4.16)
Although the C–F bond is not so easily cleaved
by reduction owing to its larger bond energy
compared to that of the C–H bond, fluorine
attached to a benzylic position or α to carbonyl
and
imino
groups
is
readily
removed
by
cathodic reduction. This is also quite similar to
the cases shown in Eqs. 4.15 and 4.16. As shown
in Eq. 4.17, electron transfer first takes place at
the aromatic ring or carbonyl and imino groups
followed by β-elimination of the fluoride ion
[25]. When the cathodic reaction shown in Eq.
4.17 is carried out in the absence of Me3SiCl,
further cathodic reduction takes place to result
in successive elimination of fluorine atoms,
providing complicated products.
129

(4.17)
4.5.3 Electroauxiliaries Based on
Intermolecular Coordination Effects
This effect is quite important from an electron
transfer aspect. The electron transfer reaction
in
solution
is
generally
facilitated
by
the
stabilization of the resulting radical ion and
ionic intermediates by the coordination of
solvent
molecules
or
counter
ions
in
the
solution. For instance, the reduction potential
of the metal cation usually becomes more
negative in solvents with large donor numbers
because the positive nature of the metal cation
is decreased by solvation in such solvents.
It is well known that the reduction potentials of
ketones, imines, cyano and nitro compounds
shift
in
the
positive
direction
by
proton
addition. The polarography of the reduction of
nitro compounds has been intensively studied.
When the pH value of the solution is made
more acidic by one pH unit, the reduction
potential becomes more positive by about 58
mV. The positive shift of the reduction potential
is
due
to
the
protonation
of
unsaturated
functional
groups
resulting
in
a
positively
charged form, as shown in Figure 4.13.
130

Figure 4.13 Anodic shift of reduction potential
owing to protonation
Furthermore,
the
reduction
potentials
of
ketones often shift to positive in the presence of
Lewis acids. This is due to the coordination of
the Lewis acid to the oxygen atom of the
carbonyl group resulting in a decrease in the
electron density of the carbonyl group or
coordination of the Lewis acid to the anion
radical intermediate generated by one-electron
reduction of the carbonyl group resulting in
stabilization of the intermediate, as shown in
Figure 4.14.
131

Figure 4.14 Anodic shift of reduction potential
owing to coordination with Lewis acid and
hydrogen bonding
It is also known that the second reduction
potentials of diketones like anthraquinone and
dinitrobenzenes shift greatly in the positive
direction in the presence of alcohols. This is due
to the formation of hydrogen bonds between
dianion
intermediates
generated
by
two-electron reduction and the alcohols.
4.5.4 Electroauxiliaries Based on
Intramolecular Coordination Effects
If
a
substrate
molecule
has
a
specific
coordinating site such as a functional group or
heteroatom to stabilize the electrogenerated
ionic intermediate, the electron transfer is
enhanced by intramolecular coordination, as
shown in Figure 4.15. As such a functional
group, pyridyl, carbonyl and ether groups are
effective,
and
they
decrease
the
oxidation
potential appreciably. Such coordination would
facilitate subsequent chemical steps like bond
fission.
When
bond
cleavage
accompanies
electron transfer, as shown in Figure 4.15, the
oxidation potential decreases significantly. This
is quite a new concept and methodology for
electron transfer control [26]. Furthermore, it
has been demonstrated that a combination of
the
orbital
interaction
and
intramolecular
coordination is highly effective for controlling
132

the oxidation potential as well as the reaction
pathway.

4.6 Reaction Pattern of Organic
Electrode Reactions
Although electrode reactions are limited to
oxidation
and
reduction,
various
follow-up
chemical
reactions
often
take
place
after
organic electron transfer. Organic electrode
reactions are therefore quite different from
those of inorganic compounds.
From a synthetic viewpoint, organic electrode
reactions are classified into various reaction
types, and examples of cathodic reduction and
anodic oxidation are given here.

facilitate the polymerization in a chain reaction
mechanism, while the following reaction is

solvents, chiral adsorbants and chiral modified
electrodes are used.
4.7 Electrochemically Generated
Reactive Species
Electrochemically generated reactive species
often
undergo
follow-up
reactions
in
an
adsorbed state or near the electrode surface to
provide products. Since these reactive species
are affected by the electrode itself and a strong
145

electric field (approximately 107–108 V cm−1),
their reactivity and behaviour are often quite
different
from
the
same
reactive
species
generated by other methods. Useful synthetic
reactions
can
be
developed
utilizing
such
unique
electrogenerated
reactive
species.
A
variety
of
ionic
and
radical
species
are
generated
by
electrolysis.
Electrochemically
generated reactive species are classified into
carbon species and heteroatom ones, and their
generation methods are explained below.
4.7.1 Carbon Species
4.7.1.1 Anodically Generated Carbon
Species
Oxidation
of
Carboxylic
Acid:
Anodic
oxidative decarboxylation of carboxylic acid
generates an alkyl radical and/or alkyl cation
[27]. A carboxylic acid with a straight alkyl
chain is oxidized at the Pt anode in weak acidic
solution to generate mainly the corresponding
alkyl
radical.
On
the
other
hand,
anodic
oxidation of carboxylic acid with an α-branched
alkyl chain at a carbon anode in neutral or
alkaline
solution
generates
mainly
the
corresponding alkyl cation.
(4.81)
Oxidation
of
Carbanion
and
Active
Hydrogen
Compounds:
The
oxidation
146

potentials of carbanions are extremely low and
their one-electron oxidation generates radicals.
(4.82)
(4.83)
Oxidation of Alkyl Halides: Alkyl iodides
are more easily reduced and oxidized compared
to
the
corresponding
bromides.
Their
one-electron
oxidation
generates
a
radical
cation intermediate followed by elimination of
the halogen molecule to generate the alkyl
cation.
(4.84)
Oxidation of Olefins, Ketones, Imines,
and Strain and Cage Compounds: The
oxidation potential of ketone is generally high,
but
even
aliphatic
ketone
is
oxidizable.
Although alkane is difficult to oxidize, strain
cyclopropanes and cage-type adamantanes are
relatively
easy
to
oxidize.
One-electron
oxidation of those compounds generates radical
cations.
(4.85)
147

(4.86)
Oxidation
of
Aromatic
Compounds:
Initially,
one-electron
transfer
from
the
aromatic ring occurs to generate a radical
cation on the ring. When an alkyl chain exists
on
the
aromatic
ring,
elimination
of
the
α-proton from the alkyl chain generates the
corresponding benzyl radical, which undergoes
further
one-electron
oxidation
to
generate
benzyl cation. On the other hand, in the case of
difficult
elimination
of
the
α-proton
or
aromatics devoid of α-proton, the aromatic
radical
cation
is
attacked
by
nucleophiles,
resulting
in
ring
substitution
with
the
nucleophiles. In the absence of nucleophiles,
homo-coupling of radical cations or radical
intermediates takes place.
(4.87)
(4.88)
4.7.1.2 Cathodically Generated Carbon
Species
Reduction of Alkyl Halides: The ease of
reduction of alkyl halides is related to the bond
energy of C–X, and hence iodide compounds
148

are the most easily reduced, while chloride
compounds are the most difficult to reduce.
One-electron and two-electron reduction of
alkyl halides generate alkyl radicals and alkyl
anions, respectively.
(4.89)
Reduction of Ketone and Imine: In the
case of cathodic reduction of ketone and imine
in aqueous solution, the generated reactive
species as well as the reaction mechanism are
changed by the pH of the solution. In an acidic
solution, the oxygen atom of the ketone and the
nitrogen atom of the imine are protonated,
therefore their reduction potentials shifts to the
positive side, and their one-electron reduction
generates neutral radicals. In contrast, in an
alkaline solution the protonation of ketone and
imine
does
not
occur
due
to
low
proton
concentration. In this case, the radical anion is
generated first, and then the dianion is formed.
(4.90)
Reduction
of
Activated
Olefin
and
Conjugated Olefin: Activated olefin is readily
reduced
because
the
electron-withdrawing
group attached to the double bond decreases
the
electron
density
of
the
double
bond.
149

Isolated olefin is not so easy to reduce, but
conjugated olefin is reducible. One-electron
reduction of the olefin generates a radical
anion.
(4.91)
Reduction
of
Active
Hydrogen
Compounds: One-electron reduction of an
active
hydrogen
compound
generates
the
corresponding anion, eliminating the active
hydrogen atom as hydrogen gas.
(4.92)
Reduction of gem- and vic-Dihalogeno
Compounds: Two-electron reduction of these
compounds generates carbene and benzyne.
(4.93)
150

(4.94)
4.7.2 Heteroatom Species
Different
from
hydrocarbons,
heteroatom
compounds are oxidizable since they have lone
paired electrons on the heteroatom, from which
electron transfer occurs. In general, ease of
oxidation has the order N > S > O, and a variety
of
nitrogen
active
species
are
generated
electrochemically [28].
4.7.2.1 Nitrogen Species
One-electron oxidation of amine generates a
radical cation at the nitrogen atom. The radical
cation of aromatic amine is relatively stable,
while that of aliphatic amine is so unstable that
the α-proton is immediately eliminated, and
then the active site shifts to the α-carbon. In the
case of ordinary aliphatic amines, iminium ions
are so unstable that cleavage of the C–N bond
occurs predominantly. On the other hand,
iminium ions of aromatic amines, carbamates
and amides are stable, therefore nucleophilic
substitution
reactions
like
methoxylation,
acetoxylation and cyanation occur efficiently at
the α-position to the nitrogen atom, as shown in
151

Eq. 4.95 [6]. These anodic substitutions are one
of the characteristic electrolytic reactions and
they are useful for construction of a C–C bond
at the adjacent position to the nitrogen atom.
Anodic substitution at the adjacent position to
the nitrogen atom of imines is also possible, as
shown in Eq. 4.96 [29].
(4.95)
(4.96)
Depending
on
the
molecular
structures
of
amines, the active site is retained at the original
nitrogen, resulting in the generation of various
reactive
nitrogen
species,
and
eventually
reactions occur at the nitrogen atom, as shown
in Figure 4.16 [28]. Two-electron reduction of
N,N-dihalo
compounds
generates
the
corresponding nitrenes [30], while two-electron
oxidation of aziridine and medium-sized cyclic
amines
followed
by
deprotonation
of
NH
moiety generates nitrenium ions [31]. Anodic
152

oxidation of hydrazine derivatives generates
amino
nirenes
[32].
In
particular,
anodic
oxidation of N-phthalimide in the presence of
olefin
provides
the
corresponding
aziridine
derivatives in high yields, as shown in Figure
4.16 [33]. The reaction proceeds via anodically
generated aminonitrene.
(4.97)
Figure
4.16
Electrochemically
generated
reactive nitrogen species
Furthermore,
anodic
oxidation
of
bicyclic
amines
and
aliphatic
amines
devoid
of
α-protons generates aminyl radicals efficiently.
153

In the former case, anodic elimination of
α-proton cannot occur due to Bredt's rule.
(4.98)
(4.99)
4.7.2.2 Oxygen Species
Oxidation
of
Alcohol
and
Carboxylic
Acid: Radical species are mainly generated
from these compounds, but cationic species
could also be generated.
(4.100)
(4.101)
Oxidation of Ether: Similarly to the case of
organonitrogen compounds, anodic oxidation
of ethers generates a cation α to the oxygen
atom,
which
undergoes
nucleophilic
substitution.
However,
the
scope
of
its
application is limited because of the high
oxidation potentials of ethers.
154

(4.102)
Reduction
of
Alcohol
and
Carboxylic
Acid:
One-electron
reduction
of
these
compounds
generates
the
corresponding
anions, eliminating a hydrogen molecule.
(4.103)
Reduction
of
Dioxygen:
One-electron
reduction of dioxygen generates superoxide ion,
which is called active oxygen and works as both
oxidant and reductant as well as base and
radical (see section 5.2).
(4.104)
4.7.2.3 Calcogeno (Sulfur, Selenium,
Tellurium) Species
Carcogen compounds are easily oxidized and
oxidation of the corresponding anion generates
radicals that are further oxidized to cations, as
shown in Eq. 4.105. These oxidation processes
are
usually
reversible
electron
transfers
although
the
reversibility
depends
on
the
electrolytic conditions.
(4.105)
In the case of sulfides, the anodically generated
radical cation at the sulfur atom is attacked by
155

nucleophiles (nucleophilic addition). However,
in the case of sulfide with a strongly acidic
α-hydrogen,
α-deprotonation
of the radical
cation occurs predominantly and eventually
α-nucleophilic
substitution
takes
place
selectively. Among the substitution reactions,
fluorination is of great importance in synthetic
organic chemistry. However, in the case of
selenides,
even
selenides
having
an
electron-withdrawing
group
do
not
always
undergo
nucleophilic
substitutions,
and
a
nucleophilic addition reaction also occurs at the
selenium atom. In contrast, anodic substitution
of
organotelluides
is
not
known
and
nucleophilic addition at the tellurium atom
predominantly occurs.
(4.106)
4.7.2.4 Halogen Species
Halogen is easily oxidized and also readily
reduced. Since the redox reaction of the halide
ion is reversible, it is widely used as a mediator
for
indirect
electrochemical
oxidation
(see
Chapters 3 and 5).
(4.107)
156

4.7.2.5 14-Family and 15-Family Element
Species
Reactive species are generated predominantly
at heteroatoms by electron transfer, as shown in
Eqs. 4.108–4.110.

Organic Electrode Reactions
162

Toshio Fuchigami and Shinsuke Inagi
Development of new methodology to achieve
highly selective reactions is one of the most
important areas in organic synthetic chemistry.
As already described, electrode reactions have
their
own
specific
factors
for
controlling
selectivity, therefore both electrochemical and
ordinary chemical factors make the control of
electrochemical reactions more complicated.
Electrodes are of great importance for both
electron transfer interfaces and reaction fields.
As described earlier, an electrode has a function
to control a chemical reaction pathway through
adsorption and orientation of the substrate
molecule to the electrode surface. Although
hydrogen and oxygen overpotentials could be
criteria for the selection of suitable electrode
materials to achieve the desired electrochemical
reaction
in
an
aqueous
solution,
these
overpotentials are not proper criteria in aprotic
solutions. Hence, it is not so easy to predict
suitable
electrode
materials
for
desired
electrochemical reaction in aprotic solvents.
However,
many
novel
electrolytic
methodologies have been developed in order to
achieve
high
selectivity
for
the
desired
reactions.
In
this
chapter,
relatively
new
electrolytic methodologies, which have already
been established and are widely used, will be
described in detail. Although there are many
163

applications of such electrochemical reactions
to organic syntheses, limited examples are
given in this chapter. It is recommended that
readers also study other more detailed books
[1].
5.1 Electrocatalysis
Although
indirect
electrochemical
reactions
using mediators, i.e. electrocatalytic reactions,
have already been explained in Chapter 2,
various examples of synthetic applications are
described in this chapter [2]. Some other
synthetic examples are also demonstrated in
Chapters 6 and 7.
5.1.1 Classification and Kinds of
Mediators
Mediators are classified into two groups, as
shown in Eqs. 5.1 and 5.2: outer sphere type
mediators involving electron transfer between
the mediator and a substrate molecule (Eq. 5.1),
and inner sphere type mediators involving
redox
reaction
through
ordinary
chemical
reactions (Eq. 5.2), as shown in Table 5.1.

Sulfide
Mediators are also classified into oxidative and
reductive mediators, and into organic and
inorganic mediators. Various redox mediators
are
known,
for
example
(i)
inorganic
compounds such as multivalent metal ions,
transition metal complexes and halide ions, (ii)
165

organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic
compounds,
triarylamines
and
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
nitroxyl
(TEMPO), (iii) anomalous valence compounds
and
(iv)
hypervalent
compounds.
Quite
recently, novel mediators such as carboranes,
which have the characteristics of boron atoms,
have
been
developed
for
highly
efficient
cathodic
reductive
dehalogenation
[3].
Triarylimidazole mediators have also recently
been developed for selective anodic oxidation

5.1.2 Organic Electrolytic Reactions
Using Mediators
5.1.2.1 Electrosynthesis Using Multivalent
Metal Ion Mediators
Polyvalent metal ions have been used for a long
time and some are still used for industrial
electrolysis.
Synthetic
examples
using
such
mediators are illustrated in Eq. 5.3. Direct
electrolysis of toluene derivatives provides a
mixture
of
aldehyde
and
carboxylic
acid
derivatives, while each product can be obtained
167

selectively
by
the
choice
of
appropriate
mediator.
(5.3)
5.1.2.2 Electrosynthesis Using Halogen
Mediators
Anodic oxidation of halide ions (X−) generates
various kinds of reactive cationic species, for
example X+, OX−, X2, X3−etc., which are
widely
utilized
as
mediators
for
various
oxidative molecular conversions, as shown in
Figure 5.1. Oxidative power increases in the
order I < Br < Cl, and positive Cl is too strong
oxidant to give good selectivity. Iodide and
bromide ions are therefore mainly employed as
mediators for selective indirect oxidation. The
synthetic applications of such electrogenerated
active halogen species as mediators have been
demonstrated
by
highly
selective
functionalization of olefins, e.g. epoxidation,
halohydroxylation,
1,2-dihalogenation
and
ene-type chlorination, heteroatom–heteroatom
168

bond formation and carbon–heteroatom bond
cleavage [5–8].

5.1.2.3 Electrosynthesis Using Triarylamine
Mediators
Triarylamines, which are well known as outer
sphere electron transfer reagents, were first
used
as
mediators
for
anodic
oxidative
deprotection
of
a
protective
group
like
dithiolane for a carbonyl group by Steckhan
(Eq. 5.4) [2]. The oxidation ability of this
mediator can be tuned by substitution with
electron-withdrawing
groups
such
as
the
bromine
atom,
as
shown
in
Table
5.3.
Triarylamine
mediators
can
be
applied
to
oxidation
of
alcohols,
amines
and
the
side-chain of aromatic compounds, together
with
fluorodesulfurization.
Thus,
they
are
highly useful and widely applicable mediators.

5.1.2.4 Electrosynthesis Using
Multi-Mediatory Systems
Various combinations of different kinds of
mediators have been developed to expand the
scope of electrosynthesis. As shown in Figure
5.2, a double mediator consisted of sulfide and
170

bromide ions enables the oxidation of alcohols
at much lower oxidation potential [9].

5.1.2.5 Electrosynthesis Using Hypervalent
Compounds as Mediators
Anodic oxidation of p-methoxyiodobenzene in
the presence of fluoride ions provides the
corresponding
hypervalent
difluoroiodo
derivative,
which
is
a
useful
fluorinating
reagent. Thus, p-methoxyiodobenzene has been
demonstrated to be a highly efficient mediator
for anodic fluorodesulfurization of dithioacetals
as shown in Figure 5.3 [10]. This is the first
successful example of the catalytic use of
hypervalent compounds for organic synthesis as
well as organic electrosynthesis.

Anodic
α-fluorination
of
α,γ-diketones
and

can
be
also
achieved
using
p-iodotoluene as a mediator [11].
5.1.2.6 Electrosynthesis Using Transition
Metal Complex Mediators
Transition
metal
complex
mediators
have
various reactivities and many advantages. Their
redox potentials and the selectivity of the
desired reaction can be controlled by changing
ligand. Their synthetic application is mainly
based on the reactivity of the low valent state
generated
by
cathodic
reduction
of
the
mediators
[2].
Typically,
Co(III)
complex
(vitamin B12) is readily reducible, optically
active, non-toxic and inexpensive. It is reduced
at −0.9 V vs. SCE to form Co(I) complex, which
undergoes oxidative addition to alkyl halide to
form alkyl Co(III) complex as an intermediate.
The resulting intermediate is reduced at more
172

negative potential, −1.5 V vs. SCE, to generate
an alkyl radical or anion, and Co(I) complex is
regenerated
simultaneously
(reductive
elimination). Since the resulting alkyl radical or
anion undergoes conjugate addition, efficient
Michael addition can be achieved under neutral
conditions, as shown in Figure 5.4 [12]. This
mediatory
reaction
is
widely
applicable
to
various halogeno compounds, such as allyl
halides, vinyl halides, α-halo ethers and so on.
Figure
5.4
Electrosynthesis
using
Co(III)
complex, vitamin B12 as mediator
As shown in Eq. 5.5, even halogeno compounds
with
non-protected
hydroxyl
and
carbonyl
groups can be used, which is one of the
advantages of this mediatory system [13].
(5.5)
On
the
other
hand,
β-bromodiester
and
ω-bromoalkyl
acrylate
undergo
1,2-rearrangement
and
intramolecular
173

cyclization, respectively, to form large cyclic
lactones
by
their
cathodic
reduction
using
hydrophobic vitamin B12 mediator under UV
irradiation [14].
Homo-coupling products are obtained from
aromatic halides using Pd(0) complex as well as
Ni(0) complex as a mediator [15]. The yields
and turnover of the Pd(0) complex are generally
superior to those using Ni(0) complex. The
mechanism proposed is shown in Figure 5.5.
Aromatic halide reacts with Pd(0) complex to
generate an aryl Pd intermediate, which is
reduced cathodically followed by reaction with
one more aryl halide molecule to form diaryl Pd
complex, resulting in reductive elimination to
give
a
homo-coupling
product.
When
this
reaction is performed in the presence of CO2,
aromatic carboxylic acids are obtained in high
yields [16].
174

Pd(0) complex
5.1.2.7 Electrosynthesis Using Mediator
Immobilzed on Solid
N-Oxyl
radicals
exemplified
by
2,2,3,3-tetramethylpiperidinyl-N-oxyl
(TEMPO) are useful mediators for efficient
oxidation
of
alcohols
and
amines.
The
mediators
have
never
been
recovered
and
reused
after
electrolysis,
but
recyclable
mediators have recently been developed from
an atom economical aspect. Mediators are
immobilized on the surface of silica gel through
silane coupler, and are readily recovered and
recycled
after
electrolysis.
Thus,
the
combination
of
halide
ions
and
TEMPO-immobilized
silica
gel
or
polymer
particles as a disperse phase enables a mediated
electrocatalytic
reaction
in
aqueous
NaBr-NaHCO3
as
a
disperse
media
[17].
Asymmetric
oxidation
of
alcohols
is
also
possible using a chiral N-oxyl mediator [18].
5.2 Electrogenerated Acids and
Bases
5.2.1 Electrogenerated Bases
Acids and bases play very important roles in
organic synthesis. It is well known that when
aqueous
solution
containing
a
neutral
175

supporting
electrolyte
is
electrolysed
in
a
divided cell, the anolyte becomes acidic while
the catholyte becomes alkaline. This is because
hydroxide ions are consumed at the anode
while protons are consumed at the cathode. In a
similar manner, some acid is generated in the
anolyte while some base is generated in the
catholyte
during
electrolysis
in
an
organic
solvent. Even in an undivided cell, the vicinity
of an anode becomes acidic while that of a
cathode becomes basic during electrolysis.
Anionic species generated cathodically act not
only as nucleophiles but also as bases, and have
interesting reactivities in organic synthesis. The
inventor
of the cathodic
hydrodimerization
process of acrylonitrile, Baizer, demonstrated
that the cathodically generated anion radical of
hindered azobenzene (Figure 5.6) could be a
useful base for various organic synthesis, and
he named such bases electrogenerated bases
(EGBs) [19].
Figure 5.6 Electrogenerated base of hindered
azobenzene
176

There are two main methods for the generation
of EGBs, as shown in Eq. 5.6. One method is
cathodic
reduction
of
compounds
with
an
unsaturated
moiety
in
aprotic
solvents
containing quaternary ammonium salt as a
supporting electrolyte to generate the radical
anions or dianions, and the other one is
cathodic
reductive
deprotonation
of
active
hydrogen
compounds
to
generate
the
corresponding anions.
(5.6)
Cathodic
reductive
deprotonation
of
2-pyrrolidone,
a
hindered
phenol
like
2,6-t-butyl-4-methylphenol,
and
triphenylmethane generates the corresponding
anions.
Since
EGBs
have
quaternary
ammoniumcations (Q+), the anions formed by
the treatment with EGB have high reactivity
(Figure 5.7) and hence this methodology is
highly useful for organic synthesis.
177

Figure
5.7
Reactive
anion
derived
from
electrogenerated base (Q+ = Et4N+)
In
particular,
the
EGB
derived
from
2-pyrrolidone is a versatile base and applicable
to
organic
synthesis
such
as
Stevens
rearrangement, selective α-monoalkylation of
α-(aryl)acetate esters and C-monoalkylation of
1,3-diketones [20,21]. This EGB has also been
demonstrated to be a highly efficient base for
the synthesis of organofluorine compounds. For
instance, it is known that trifluoromethyl anion
is so unstable that it undergoes α-elimination of
fluoride anion to generate fluorocarbene, but
stable trifluoromethyl anion can be generated
by the treatment of fluoroform with this EGB,
and
consequently
trifluoromethylation
of
aromatic aldehydes and ketones is realized to
give the trifluoromethylated alcohols, as shown
in Eq. 5.7 [22].
(5.7)
178

Generally, it is quite difficult to generate the
enolate anion with an α-CF3 group since the
enolate anion readily undergoes decomposition
such as β-elimination of fluoride ion. However,
pyrrolidone-derived
EGB
enables
the
generation of stable trifluoromethylated enolate
anion, and alkylation can be performed in good
yield without elimination of the fluorine atom,
as shown in Eq. 5.8 [23].
(5.8)
Furthermore, this EGB catalyzes ring-opening
polymerization
of
N-carboxyanhydrides
of
α-amino acid (NCA) to provide poly(amino
acids) in a short time in excellent yield, as
shown in Eq. 5.9. The yield is much higher and
the reaction time relatively short compared to
reactions using conventional base with a metal
cation such as Na+ [24].
179

(5.9)
EGB derived from hindered phenol catalyzes a
selective double aldol condensation reaction, as
shown in Eq. 5.10 [25].
(5.10)
It is well known that the substrate molecule
itself also serves as an EGB. For instance, as
shown in Eq. 5.11, a catalytic amount of EGB
efficiently catalyzes aldol condensation. In this
reaction, aldehyde itself is cathodically reduced
to generate a trace amount of its radical anion,
which acts as a base to abstract the α-proton
from
unreacted
aldehyde,
and
aldol
condensation
proceeds
successively
[26].
Finally, eliminating hydroxyl ion would act as
an EGB in a manner similar to a chain reaction.
180

(5.11)
Treatment
of
alcohols
with
sodium
metal
generates hydrogen gas and sodium alkoxide is
formed. This can be explained as follows. The
peripheral electron of sodium metal transfers to
the alcohol to generate a hydrogen radical,
forming hydrogen gas, and the alcohol is
transformed to the alkoxide, in other words
sodium metal acts as a reducing reagent for the
alcohol. When the alcohol is reduced at a
cathode with a low hydrogen overpotential, like
platinum,
hydrogen
gas
evolves
and
the
corresponding
alkoxide
is
readily
formed
without any reducing reagent. It can therefore
be considered that the cathode would act as
sodium metal. This is quite a safe method for
the preparation of alkoxide because harmful
sodium metal is not required. Moreover, the
cathodic reduction of carboxylic acid, phenol,
thiophenol and alcohol is performed in the
presence of quaternary ammonium salt as a
supporting
electrolyte
to
generate
the
corresponding
highly
reactive
anions
with
quaternary ammonium cation (Q+). By using
181

such
reactive
anions,
highly
selective
esterification, etherification and carbonylation
can be achieved at room temperature, as shown
in Eq. 5.12 [27,28].
(5.12)
Cathodic
reduction
of
dioxygen
generates
superoxide ion (O2−√). Superoxide ion acts as
nucleophile, oxidant, reductant, radical and
base (EGB), therefore this reactive species is
highly useful for organic synthesis. Although
superoxide ions are available from KO2 and
NaO2, these are insoluble in aprotic solvents. In
order to dissolve these salts in aprotic solvents,
costly crown ethers are required therefore their
synthetic applications are limited. On the other
hand, the electrolytic method can generate
superoxide ion in situ, which is better than the
conventional chemical method. As shown in Eq.
5.13, electrogenerated superoxide ion acts as an
EGB to eliminate the α-proton of malonic ester
derivative, followed by reaction with O2 to give
the α-hydroxy product in good yield [29]. High
current efficiency suggests that this reaction
may involve a chain reaction.
182

(5.13)
5.2.2 Electrogenerated Acids
In contrast to EGBs, the vicinity of an anode
becomes acidic during electrolysis. The acid
thus formed is called an electrogenerated acid
(EGA), which has unique reactivity compared to
conventional
chemical
acids.
For
instance,
electrolysis of a solution containing LiClO4 and
a trace amount of water generates acid, HClO4,
as shown in Figure 5.8 [30].
Figure 5.8 Principle of electrogenerated acid
EGA generated in this way is assumed to be
anhydrous HClO4, which is a stronger acid than
commercially available aq. HClO4. Such EGA
183

acts as a kind of Lewis acid and is widely
applicable to various organic reactions, for
instance
isomerization,
transformation
of
functional
groups,
carbon–carbon
bond
formation, including Diels–Alder reaction, and
so on [31]. As shown in Eq. 5.14, a combination
of supporting salts and solvents allows three
kinds of products to be obtained selectively
from the same starting material [30].
(5.14)
Furthermore, EGAs are also highly effective for
the molecular transformation of organofluorine
compounds. For instance, as shown in Eq. 5.15,
the α-cation attached to the CF3 group is
catalytically generated by the treatment of
trifluoromethylated O,S-acetal with an EGA,
and
subsequently
carbon
nucleophiles
are
readily
introduced
to
the
α-position
[32].
However, use of other conventional Lewis acids
results in no formation of the desired product.
184

(5.15)
5.3 Electrochemical Asymmetric
Synthesis
Asymmetric synthesis is a highly important
area in organic chemistry and a number of
asymmetric catalytic syntheses have recently
been
developed.
However,
electrochemical
asymmetric
synthesis
is
still
immature
compared
with
well-established
chemical,
catalytic
and
enzymatic
methods.
Various
methods
for
electrochemical
asymmetric
synthesis
have
been
proposed
[33,34]:
(i)
intramolecular
asymmetric
induction,
(ii)
utilization of chiral solvents, (iii) use of chiral
supporting salts, (iv) use of chiral electrode
adsorbance, (v) use of electrodes chemically
modified with chiral substances, (vi) use of
chiral polymer-modified electrodes, (vii) use of
chiral mediators. Among these, (i) and (ii) are
not
unique
methodology
characterized
by
electrochemistry. However, a number of papers
dealing with these methodologies have been
reported.
Although
(iii)
is
a
methodology
characterized by electrolysis, a large amount of
chiral supporting salt is required, therefore it is
185

not
useful.
Here,
methods
(iv)–(vi)
are
explained.
In
1967,
Grimshaw
first
reported
the
asymmetric
reduction
of
4-methylcumarine
using optically active alkaloids, and a maximum
asymmetric yield (17%) was obtained using a
small amount of sparteine (1 mM) as a chiral
electrode adsorbant [35]. After 10 years, Miller
obtained 48% asymmetric yield in the cathodic
reduction
of
2-acethylpyridine
to
the
corresponding alcohol in the presence of 0.5
mM
of
strychnine
salt
[36].
Asymmetric
induction seems to be attributable to the chiral
reaction fields constructed by the physical
adsorption of optically active alkaloids on the
cathode surface. However, such asymmetric
electrosynthesis is very sensitive to electrolytic
conditions
such
as
stirring,
concentration,
solvent, cathode potential and so on.
Miller and co-workers found that prochiral
carbonyl compounds like ethyl phenylglyoxylate
were
reduced
to
chiral
alcohols
in
10%
asymmetric
yield
on
a
cathode
chemically
modified with (S)-phenylglycine [37]. They also
reported
asymmetric
oxidation
of
p-tolyl
methyl sulfide to the sulfone with 2.5% ee by
using
a
similar
electrode
modified
with
(+)-camphoric
acid
[38].
These
are
also
pioneering
works
on
chemically
modified
electrodes. The low asymmetric yields seem to
be due to a low density of chiral compound on
186

the electrode surface, and other researchers
have pointed out that Miller's results are not
always reproducible. Later on, in order to solve
problems such as the instability of electrodes
modified with chiral adsorbance and the low
density of modified chiral compounds, chiral
polymer-modified electrodes were developed.
For
instance,
Nonaka,
Fuchigami
and
co-workers prepared various electrodes coated
with optically active poly(amino acid)s and
applied these to the asymmetric reduction of
olefins. They obtained 43% ee in the reduction
of 4-methylcumarin at a cathode coated with
poly(L-valine) as shown in Figure 5.9 [39].
Figure 5.9 Asymmetric reduction using chiral
polymer-modified electrode
Subsequently, a graphite felt electrode modified
with
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxyl
(TEMPO)
was
developed
and
applied
to
enantioselective
oxidative
coupling
of
2-naphthol,
2-methoxynaphthalene
and
10-hydroxyphenanthrene in the presence of
(−)-sparteine
as
a
chiral
base.
The
enantioselectivity of the coupling products was
very high (98%) [40,41]. It has been considered
that high asymmetric yield cannot be expected
187

since electrolytic reactions usually require polar
solvents. It should therefore be noted that such
excellent results of asymmetric electrosynthesis
were realized even in polar solvents.
The combination of enzymes such as lactic acid
dehydrogenase
and
mediators
or
chiral
mediators is also effective for electrochemical
asymmetric synthesis and kinetic resolution to
provide products with high asymmetric yields
[42–44].
5.4 Modified Electrodes
As described previously, electrode surfaces and
the vicinities of electrodes are the main reaction
fields for electrode reactions, therefore if the
electrode
surface
is
modified
with
desired
functional substances such as electrocatalyst,
and chiral compound, the efficiency, desired
selectivity,
asymmetric
synthesis,
and
etc.
would be realized. Such electrodes are called
modified electrodes and their use enables the
amount of functional materials required to be
reduced
and
the
work-up
for
electrolytic
solutions
to
be
simplified
[45].
Excellent
durability is needed for the modified electrodes
for
electrosynthesis
since
both
a
large
electrolytic current and long electrolysis time
are required, which is different from modified
electrodes for sensors. Modified electrodes are
classified as follows depending on modification
methods and modifiers.
188

5.4.1 Electrodes Modified with
Adsorbants
When the electrode is immersed in a solution
containing redox compounds like flavins and
phenazines,
and
then
pulled
up
from
the
solution, an electrode modified with the redox
compounds
is
readily
obtained.
The
modification is not very strong, the durability of
the modified electrode is not great and the
modification density is low. On the other hand,
an electrode modified with strongly adhering
and homogeneous films with redox catalysts
using
the
Langmuir–Blodgett
technique
is
superior to an adsorbant-modified electrode
since both the modification density (density of
redox
catalyst)
and
durability
of
the
Langmuir–Blodgett film modified electrode are
much
higher.
Based
on
hydrophilic/
hydrophobic control of the electrode surface
using
Langmuir–Blodgett
film
containing
quaternary ammonium salt, product selectivity
control
has
been
achieved
[46].
Langmuir–Blodgett film-coated electrodes also
allow electrocatalytic reactions to be achieved
[47].
5.4.2 Foreign Metal Adatom Modified
Electrodes
Base electrodes can be modified by deposition
of foreign metal adatoms at potentials several
hundred millivolts positive to the reversible
189

potential for metal deposition. A submonolayer
of adatoms covers the base electrode surface
uniformly, making it into an adatoms modified
electrode [48]. Such electrodes are highly useful
for electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction and
oxidation of methanol, therefore the electrodes
are
currently
of
great
importance
in
the
development of fuel cells.
These electrodes also allow interesting product
selectivity as follows. Cathodic reduction of
dinitrobenzenes at a silver cathode in an acidic
methanol
solution
mainly
provides
diaminobenzenes, while the use of a silver
cathode modified by deposition of lead adatoms
forms phenylene dihydroxyamines selectively,
as shown in Eq. 5.16 [49]. This is considered to
be due to the inhibition of adsorption of the
intermediate phenylene dihydroxyamines on
the electrode surface by deposited lead atoms,
which interfere with further reduction.
(5.16)
5.4.3 Chemically Modified Electrodes
As described above, Miller's work on chiral
compound modified electrodes has stimulated
190

intense and fruitful research in the field of
chemically
modified
electrodes.
Functional
substances are immobilized on base electrodes
through covalent bonds like ester, ether and
amide
with
desired
functional
substances.
When noble metal electrodes like gold and
platinum are immersed in a solution of thiol or
disulfide for a while, the electrode surface is
readily modified with a self-assembled thiol
monolayer. Since various functional groups can
be immobilized on the electrode surface and the
method of modification is versatile, this method
is widely used. However, only a few examples of
its application to electrosynthesis are known
[50].
Pinson, Saveant and co-workers developed an
efficient and general procedure for covalent
bonding of aryl groups to an electrode by
cathodic reduction of an aryldiazonium ion. The
aryl radicals thus generated bind efficiently to
the electrode surface. The resulting modified
electrode is highly stable. Thus, various aryl
groups can be attached to carbon, silicon and
metal electrode surfaces by this procedure
[51a]. Such modified electrodes are widely
applicable,
for
instance
in
sensors
and
electrocatalysts,
but
application
to
electrosynthesis has been limited so far [51b].
191

5.4.4 Polymer-Modified (Coated)
Electrodes
Polymer-modified (coated) electrodes have an
advantage that a large number of functional
substances, such as optically active compounds
and
electroactive
compounds
like
redox
catalysts, can be incorporated in the polymer
matrix coated on the electrode surface, as
shown in Figure 5.10 [45].
Figure 5.10 Polymer-modified electrode with
redox catalyst
The polymer used for coating must be soluble in
some solvent and insoluble in the solvent
containing the supporting electrolyte used for
electroanalytical
studies
and/or
electrolytic
reactions. Modification methods are shown
below: simple dip coating and subsequent
drying,
polymer
coating
directly
from
monomers
by
chemical
or
electrochemical
initiated polymerization, conducting polymer
coating and a confirmed chemical binding like
192

an amido bonding of the polymer layer using
electrode surface anchor groups.
The following polymer materials are used for
the modification of electrodes:
redox polymer (polyviologene,
polyvinylferrocene, etc.)
polymers (poly-4-vinylpyridine,
polyvinylsulfonic acid, polyacrylonitrile,
etc.) that can form metal complexes and
immobilize redox active species through
columbic interaction
polymers (polycarbonate, polyurethane,
etc.) that enable selective ion/gas
permeation
conducting polymers.
Although examples of inorganic polymer-coated
electrodes
are
limited,
Prussian
blue,
heteropolyacid, clay film etc. can be utilized as
modification substances. The polymer-modified
electrodes have wide applications for fuel cells,
capacitors, display materials, biosensors, ion/
gas sensors and asymmetric synthesis, and
therefore they are currently being intensively
studied.
5.5 Paired Electrosynthesis
Electrosynthesis
involves
the
simultaneous
occurrence of both reduction at a cathode and
oxidation at an anode. In a typical inorganic
193

electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride, sodium hydroxide is produced at the
cathode, while chlorine gas is formed at the
anode.
Thus,
both
electrode
reactions
are
efficiently utilized. In organic electrolysis, the
synthesis of desired products is performed by
either cathodic or anodic reaction. Hence, in
most cases, the reaction products at the counter
electrode
are
wasted,
therefore
the
simultaneously synchronous utilization of both
cathode
and
anode
reactions
for
efficient
synthesis of desired products is preferable from
a
practical
point
of
view.
Paired
electrosynthesis is based on this methodological
concept.
Baizer
first
formulated
and
demonstrated approaches to the above concept,
and
introduced
the
term
of
paired
electrosynthesis [19,52]. At most 200% current
efficiency could be expected in the ideal case of
paired
electrosynthesis
using
cathodic
and
anodic processes to provide the same product.
Recently, BASF Co. in Germany commercialized
paired
electrosynthesis
for
the
first
time.
Phthalide
and
t-butylbenzaldehyde
dimethylacetal are produced simultaneously in
an undivided cell. The details are described in
Chapter 8.
Paired
electrosynthesis
is
classified
in
the
following
ways
based
on
reaction
modes
[19,52].
Parallel paired electrosynthesis
(electrosynthesis of different
194

products from different starting
substrates): A typical example is
electrosynthesis of dihydrophthalic acid and
acetylene dicarboxylic acid from phthalic
acid and butynediol at a cathode and anode,
respectively [52]
Divergent paired electrosynthesis
(electrosynthesis of different
products from the same substrate):
Details and an example are described in
Chapter 7 (Figure 7.8).
Convergent paired electrosynthesis:
This is the electrosynthesis of a single
product from different starting substrates,
for instance electrosynthesis of propylene
oxide via chlorohydrine from propylene and
chloride ion as well as electrosynthesis of
sulfeneimines from amine and disulfide
using bromide ion mediator [53]. As shown
in Figure 5.11, aliphatic ester is reduced with
reactive Mg metal cathodically derived from
Mg ion and alkoxide ion is formed. On the
other hand, tetrahydrofuran as a solvent is
oxidized at the anode to generate the
corresponding cation intermediate, which
reacts with the cathodically formed alkoxide
ion to give α -alkoxytetrahydrofuran [54]. In
this reaction, both anodic and cathode
reactions participate to produce a single
product, thereby the total current
efficiencies do not exceed 100%. The
electrolytic reaction shown in Figure 5.12 is
195

another example [55]. The
trifluoromethylation of fumaronitrile
requires both anodic and cathodic reactions,
hence this reaction is a kind of paired
electrosynthesis.
Linear paired electrosynthesis
(electrosynthesis of single product
through anodic oxidation followed by
cathodic reduction or vice versa): As
shown in Eq. 5.17, oxidation of
2,3-butandiol provides acetoin, and
afterwards acetoin is reduced at an Hg/Zn
cathode to ethyl methyl ketone [56]. The use
of an undivided cell is essential in this case.
(5.17)
Paired electrosynthesis using EGB
regenerated at the anode and cathode
successively or vice versa: Figure 5.13
illustrates an example of this kind of paired
electrosynthesis. An azobenzene is reduced
to give the corresponding dianion (EGB),
which then reacts with a mixture of ethyl
acetate and butyl bromide as the starting
substrate to give the final product (ethyl
α-(acetyl)hexanoate) and EGBH2. The
EGBH2 is oxidized at the anode to
regenerate the EGB [57].
196

Paired electrosynthesis using
different mediators regenerated at
the anode and cathode: Dioxygen (O2) is
cathodically reduced in aqueous and
non-aqueous solutions to reactive oxygen
species such as H2O2 and O2−√,
respectively, which are oxidizing reagents
for organic compounds. Hence, cathodic
oxidation of organic substrates is realized
using such cathodically generated oxygen
species. However, the concentration of
cathodically generated H2O2 is so low that
the oxidation rate of organic compounds
with H2O2 is not enough for a practical
electrolytic process. Catalysts are therefore
necessary for the practical cathodic
oxidation to be paired with the anodic
oxidation. Nonaka and his co-workers
developed a unique cathodic oxidation
system using a tungstate/pertungstate redox
mediator and applied this to the paired
electrosynthesis, as shown in Figure 5.14
[58]. N-Hydroxyamine derivative as a single
starting substrate is indirectly oxidized to
the nitrone as a single product with HWO5−
derived from HWO4−and H2O2 in a
cathodic chamber, and with halogen (X2)
anodically formed from X−in an anodic
chamber. The total cathodic and anodic
current efficiencies for the nitrone were very
high (190%).
197

In addition, paired electrosynthesis was also
developed by the combination of anodic
oxidation and cathodic reduction using a
hydroxyl radical derived from H2O2 and
various metal ion redox mediatory catalysts,
such as Fe2+/Fe3+, V4+/V3+, Cu+/Cu2+ and
Ni2+/Ni3+.
Parallel paired electrochemical
polymer reaction: Quite recently, Inagi,
Fuchigami and co-workers achieved the first
paired electrochemical polymer reactions of
conducting polymers, such as alternating
copolymers of 9-fluorenol and
9,9-dioctylfluorene adsorbed on an anode
and cathode to form a 9-fluorenone moiety
at the anode and a fluorene moiety at the
cathode, respectively [59]. Since the
reactions are solid phase, product isolation
is very easy.

5.6 Reactive Electrodes
In order to avoid the decomposition of product
or intermediate once it has been formed at the
counter electrode, a divided cell is required.
However, the divided cell increases the cell
voltage
(the
voltage
between
anode
and
cathode) and maintenance is also troublesome.
When
the
desired
reaction
is
cathodic
reduction,
anodically
dissolving
metal
electrodes are used as anodes to avoid both the
decomposition of product or intermediate at the
anode and increase the cell voltage. Such
electrodes
are
called
sacrificial
electrodes,
sacrificial anodes or sacrificial metal anodes
[60]. For instance, as shown in Eq. 5.18,
cathodic carboxylation of organic halides using
a magnesium anode provides carboxylic acid
selectively in high yield [61]. In this case, the
carboxylate
anion
formed
is
trapped
with
magnesium ion to precipitate. Both the anodic
oxidation of the formed carboxylate ion and its
esterification with unreacted organic halide can
therefore
be
avoided.
In
such
cathodic
carboxylation, aluminium and zinc anodes, as
well as magnesium anodes, are often used.
200

(5.18)
Recently, a sacrificial metal anode was used in
electrosynthesis.
The
resulting
metal
ions
derived from the anode, e.g. Mg, Zn, Al and, Cu,
often play important roles in electrochemical
reactions. These metal ions and cathodically
generated reactive species form highly reactive
intermediates new reagents or trap halide ions
generated
by
cathodic
reduction
of
silyl
chlorides to polysilanes (see section 5.8.6) [62].
Moreover, such anodically dissolving metal ions
significantly
affect
regiochemistry,
stereochemistry and product selectivity by their
coordination and catalytic effects as well as
formation of a new reagents in situ [63]. For
instance, as shown in Figure 5.15, zinc ion
generated from the anode and trifluoromethyl
anion cathodically derived from CF3Br forms an
organometallic compound as an intermediate,
which undergoes a Reformatsky type reaction
201

with
aldehydes
and
ketones
to
provide
trifluoromethylated alcohols. In contrast, the
cathodic reduction of CF3Br in the presence of
zinc ions does not provide any desired product
[64]. Hence, anodically generated zinc ions are
very specific and quite different from ordinary
zinc ions.
Figure 5.15 Electrosynthesis using reactive
electrode
Other typical examples are the cross-coupling
reaction of activated halogenated compounds
and
carbonyl
compounds,
and
the
cross-coupling
reaction
between
non-halogenated compounds [65].
5.7 Electrochemical Fluorination
Organofluorine compounds are classified into
two groups: perfluoro compounds and partially
fluorinated compounds. The compounds in the
former class are widely utilized as functional
materials, while those in the latter family find
biological
uses
as
pharmaceuticals
and
agrochemicals.
Perfluoro
compounds
are
manufactured by converting all C–H bonds to
C–F bonds using electrochemical fluorination
202

in anhydrous liquid HF as a solvent with a
nickel
anode.
This
process
is
called
electrochemical perfluorination and has already
been commercialized (see Chapter 8) [66–69].
Electrochemical
perfluorination
in
KF-2HF
melts
at
a
carbon
anode
has
also
been
developed for the preparation of perfluorinated
low-molecular-weight organic compounds [69].
Electrochemical
partial
fluorination,
or
selective electrochemical fluorination, is a new
method [69–72]. Since the discharge potential
of the fluoride ion is extremely high (>+2.9 V
vs. SCE at Pt anode in MeCN), the fluorination
proceeds via a (radical) cation intermediate, as
shown in Eq. 5.19, which is the general pathway
for anodic nucleophilic substitutions.
(5.19)
In this method, fluorine gas is not generated
and
no
hazardous
reagents
are
required,
therefore this electrochemical fluorination is
much safer than the conventional chemical
method, which often requires hazardous and/or
difficult-to-handle reagents.
Selective
electrochemical
fluorination
can
commonly be achieved in aprotic solvents such
as
acetonitrile
(MeCN),
dichloromethane,
203

dimethoxyethane
(DME),
nitromethane
and
sulfolane containing fluoride ions to provide
mostly mono- and/or difluorinated products
[72]. Electrolyses are conducted at constant
potentials
slightly
higher
than
the
first
oxidation potential of the substrate by using a
platinum or graphite anode. Constant current
electrolysis
is
also
effective
for
selective
fluorination in many cases. The choice of the
combination of a supporting fluoride salt and
an
electrolytic
solvent
is
important
to
accomplish
efficient
selective
fluorination
because competitive anode passivation (the
formation of a non-conducting polymer film on
the anode surface that suppresses the Faradaic
current) takes place very often during the
electrolysis. Pulse electrolysis is in many cases
effective in order to avoid such passivation,
therefore
difficult-to-oxidize
fluoride
salts,
which do not cause the passivation of the anode
and have strongly nucleophilic F–, are generally
recommended as the supporting fluoride salts.
Thus, room temperature molten salts such as
R3N-nHF (n = 3–5), R4NF-nHF (n = 3–5) and
pyridine poly(hydrogen fluoride) salt (Py-nHF)
are most often used and even R4NBF4 and
R4NPF6
salts
are
effective
in
some
cases
[70–72]. Particularly when HF supporting salts
and low hydrogen overpotential cathodes such
as platinum are used, the reduction of protons
(hydrogen evolution) occurs predominantly at
the cathode during the electrolysis. A divided
204

cell
is
therefore
not
always
necessary
for
fluorination under such conditions.
In
aprotic
solvent,
F−
becomes
more
nucleophilic, but the reactivity of F−is quite
sensitive to the water content of the electrolysis
system because a hydrated F−is a weak
nucleophile. Drying of both the solvent and
electrolyte is therefore necessary to optimize
the formation of fluorinated products.
A few examples are given below, and more
examples have been reported in the literature.
5.7.1 Electrochemical Fluorination of
Aromatic Rings
Aromatic
compounds
such
as
benzene,
substituted
benzenes
and
naphthalene
are
selectively fluorinated by constant potential
anodic
oxidation
in
Et4N-3HF/MeCN
or
Et4NF-4HF without solvent (Eq. 5.20) [68,69].
Fluorination proceeds via addition with two
fluoride ions followed by elimination of HF to
provide monofluorinated aromatic compounds.
Notably, ipso-substitution with fluorine also
takes place in high yield, as shown in Eq. 5.21.
205

(5.20)
(5.21)
5.7.2 Electrochemical Fluorination of
Olefins
Electrochemical fluorination of olefins provides
mono-
and/or
difluorinated
products.
The
selectivity depends on the molecular structure
of the substrate and the electrolytic solvent, as
shown in Eq. 5.22 [72,73]. For α-acetoxystyrene
and
1-acetoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene,
the
corresponding α-fluoroketones are formed as
shown in Eq. 5.23 [72,74].
(5.22)
206

(5.23)
5.7.3 Benzylic Electrochemical
Fluorination
Although anodic benzylic substitution reactions
take place readily, anodic benzylic fluorination
does not always occur. The major competitive
reaction is acetamidation when MeCN is used
as a solvent. For example, electrochemical
benzylic
fluorination
in
MeCN
proceeded
selectively when the p-position of the phenyl
group was substituted by an electron-donating
group, as shown in Eq. 5.24 [75]. In contrast,
α-acetoamidation became the major reaction
when
the
phenyl
group
had
no
electron-donating substituent.
(5.24)
Mono- and difluorination can be performed
selectively depending on applied potential.
207

5.7.4 Electrochemical Fluorination of
Sulfides
Fuchigami and co-workers found that anodic
fluorination
of
sulfides
having
α-electron-withdrawing groups proceeded quite
well to provide the corresponding α-fluorinated
products in good yields, as shown in Eq. 5.25
[72,76]. The fluorination proceeds by way of a
Pummerer-type
mechanism
via
the
fluorosulfonium cation (A), as shown in Eq.
5.26
[77,78].
Thus,
when
R
is
an
electron-withdrawing group, the deprotonation
of
A
is
significantly
facilitated,
and
consequently
the
fluorination
proceeds
efficiently.
(5.25)
(5.26)
208

5.7.5 Electrochemical Fluorination of
Heterocyclic Compounds
Many heterocyclic compounds have specific
biological activities, while it is known that
introduction of fluorine atom(s) to organic
molecules dramatically changes or enhances
their biological activities. However, selective
fluorination of heterocyclic compounds using
conventional fluorinating reagents is not easy.
Many successful examples of selective anodic
fluorination of heterocycles containing sulfur,
nitrogen, oxygen and phosphine have been
reported to date [72,79]. Some examples are
shown in Table 5.4.

The selectivity of fluorination is also strongly
influenced by supporting fluoride salts, as
shown
in
Eq.
5.27
[80].
Since
Et3N-3HF
contains the free base Et3N, the difluorinated
product, once formed, is dehydrofluorinated to
the monofluoro product.
(5.27)
Furthermore,
anodic
difluorination
accompanied by C–C double bond cleavage is
also known, as shown in Eq. 5.28 [81].
(5.28)
Anodic fluorination of heterocyclic compounds
derived from optically active α-amino acids
proceeds
in
good
yields
and
with
high
diastereoselectivity, as shown in Eqs. 5.29 and
5.30. Notably, fluorination does not occur at the
benzylic
position
and
fluorination
predominantly takes place α to the carbonyl
group, as shown in Eq. 5.31 [82].
211

(5.29)
(5.30)
(5.31)
5.7.6 Electrochemical Fluorination of
Heterocyclic Compounds with PhS
Group as Electroauxiliary
Heterocyclic
compounds
having
a
phenylsulfenyl
group
are
also
anodically
fluorinated in good yields, as shown in Eqs.
5.32 and 5.33 [83,84].
212

(5.32)
(5.33)
It is noted that fluorination product selectivity
is
dramatically
changed
depending
on
electrolytic solvents, as shown in Eq. 5.34 [85].
(5.34)
As mentioned earlier, anode passivation takes
place often, resulting in poor yield and low
current efficiency. In order to avoid such
passivation, various mediators, such as halide
ions, triarylamines and iodoarenes, can be used,
as shown in Figure 5.16 [86].
213

Figure
5.16
Electrocatalytic
fluorodesulfurization of β-lactams
Moreover, ethereal solvents such as DME are
much more suitable than MeCN for the anodic
fluorination of various heterocyclic sulfides (Eq.
5.35) [87]. The pronounced solvent effect of
DME could be explained in terms of the
significantly
enhanced
nucleophilicity
of
fluoride ions as well as the suppression of
anode
passivation
and
overoxidation
of
fluorinated products.
(5.35)
214

5.7.7 Electrochemical Fluorination Using
Inorganic Fluoride Salts
Inorganic fluoride salts such as alkali-metal
fluorides (MFs) are stable, easy to handle and
inexpensive.
They
are
therefore
strong
candidates
for
reagents
in
nucleophilic
fluorination as well as supporting electrolytes in
chemical and electrochemical fluorination. The
challenge is to overcome problems such as poor
solubility and low nucleophilicity of MFs in
organic solvents. Phase-transfer catalysts such
as crown ethers and quaternary ammonium or
phosphonium salts are known to reduce the
coulombic
interactions
of
MFs
and
are
commonly used for this purpose. Fuchihgami
and
co-workers
reported
successful
anodic
fluorination
in
combination
with
an
electrochemical method using a poly(ethylene
glycol)/MF system where the MF is either KF or
CsF, as shown in Figure 5.17 [88].

groups

5.8 Electrochemical
Polymerization
Electrochemical
polymerization
uses
electrogenerated substrates for polymerization
as monomers or initiator. In the former case,
the
electrogenerated
aromatic
monomer
couples in a polycondensation process to give a
π-conjugated polymer, in which the p-orbitals
of
the
aromatics
overlap
throughout
the
polymer main chain. Such conjugated polymers
are intrinsically conductive and therefore are
called conducting polymers [89]. Generally they
are semi-conducting materials but chemical or
electrochemical
doping
imparts
electrical
conductivity to them. The conducting polymers
are obtained on the surface of the working
electrode as films because the electron transfer
of monomer and its coupling reaction proceeds
near the surface of the electrode and insoluble
polymeric product is deposited on it. Although
chemical electron transfer of monomers in
solution
is
also
available
to
produce
the
corresponding
conducting
polymers,
the
insoluble polymer powder obtained is difficult
to
process
for
application.
The
easy
film
formation
during
electrochemical
216

polymerization
is
useful
for
application
in
electrochemical devices such as sensors and
displays
[90].
This
chapter
deals
with
electro-oxidative
polymerization,
electro-reductive
polymerization
and
electrosynthesis of polysilane. Polymerization
of vinyl monomers using an electrogenerated
initiator system is summarized elsewhere [91],
although recent developments in this process
are included in this chapter.
5.8.1 Electro-oxidative Polymerization of
Aromatic Monomers
The electron-rich aromatic and hetero-aromatic
monomers listed in Figure 5.18 can be easily
oxidized on the anode surface to form their
radical cation states. The radical cations couple
to
form
C–C
bonds,
and
following
deprotonation this leads to a neutral dimer (Eq.
5.36). The generated conjugated dimer has a
lower oxidation potential than that of the
monomer, so further oxidation of the dimer
leads to oligomerization and polymerization.
The highly conjugated polymers are no longer
soluble in electrolytic medium and therefore are
deposited on the anode surface as a film. The
deposited polymer is oxidatively doped during
the application of potential for polymerization,
thus the film formed is not passive but still
conductive
to
carry
out
a
continuous
electrochemical reaction on the electrode. In
this
procedure,
the
coupling
position
of
217

monomer can be predicted by the spin-density
distribution on the aromatic ring [92]. The
introduction of electro-auxiliaries such as a silyl
group can enable dominant coupling at a
specific position [93].
(5.36)
Figure 5.18 Aromatic monomers for oxidative
polymerization
5.8.2 Electrochemical Polymerization
There are several methods of electrochemical
polymerization,
for
example
the
potential
sweep, potentiostatic (constant-potential) and
galvanostatic
(constant-current)
methods.
A
suitable method should be chosen depending
on the monomers and conditions used. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurement of a monomer
in a three-electrode setup gives information on
the
oxidation
potential
for
electrochemical
polymerization. To prevent overoxidation of a
product polymer, the application of a higher
218

potential to a working electrode for a long
period should be avoided since the product
polymer with extended π-conjugation is easily
oxidized
compared
to
the
corresponding
monomer.
The
potential
sweep
and
potentiostatic
methods
require
milder
polymerization
conditions
than
the
galvanostatic method.
In the potential sweep method, polymerization
is carried out with CV analyzer. A working
electrode, a counter electrode and a reference
electrode are put together in an electrolytic cell
containing
electrolyte
and
monomer.
The
repeating potential sweep across the potential
range
determined
from
the
advanced
CV
measurement produces product polymer film
on
the
working
electrode
and
this
electron-transfer process can be monitored by
CV, as shown in Figure 5.19, which shows
typical cyclic voltammograms of pyrrole during
electropolymerization. The first scan represents
the oxidation current of pyrrole monomer and
then polymerization proceeds at the surface of
the
working
electrode,
resulting
in
an
irreversible voltammogram. In the course of
deposition of the product polypyrrole during
repeated scans, anodic and cathodic currents
derived from redox of polypyrrole at a lower
potential range gradually increase.
219

Figure 5.19 Typical cyclic voltammograms of
pyrrole monomer
In the potentiostatic method a three-electrode
system is used and the applied potential to the
working
electrode
is
controlled
by
a
potentiostat with a monitoring charge. In the
galvanostatic method a two-electrode system
consisting of a working electrode and a counter
electrode is used, and constant current is
passed between them by a DC power source.
This process cannot control potential on the
220

working electrode, which may cause problems
such as overoxidation of the product polymers.
5.8.3 Conditions for Electrochemical
Polymerization
The
concentration
of
monomer
is
one
important
factor
in
electrochemical
polymerization. If the polymerization does not
proceed at the electrode surface, the use of a lot
of monomer may be effective to promote film
formation of the conducting polymers. The
choice of material for the working electrode is
also
important
in
terms
of
not
only
overpotential
but
also
compatibility
with
conducting polymer films.
In
addition
to
conventional
electrolytic
solutions such as the supporting salt/solvent,
room temperature ionic liquids are known to be
suitable as polymerization media [94]. There
are several advantages of electropolymerization
in
ionic
liquids:
(i)
electropolymerization
proceeds rapidly, (ii) the compatibility of the
product film with the electrode surface is good
and (iii) product polymers have a dense and
smooth surface, high electric conductivity, high
electrochemical
capacitance
and
good
reversibility of redox cycles.
Recently boron trifluoride–ether complex has
been shown to be attractive as a polymerization
medium [95]. Boron trifluoride acts as a Lewis
acid
to
form
a
complex
with
aromatic
221

monomer,
which
reduces
the
oxidation
potential of the monomer. This method is
therefore
effective
for
polymerization
of
aromatic
monomers
with
relatively
high
oxidation
potentials.
The
reduction
in
polymerization
potential
can
avoid
overoxidation of product polymers.
5.8.4 Electrochemical Doping
If a polymer film on a working electrode is
obtained by electropolymerization, it should be
put into electrolytic solution without monomer
(monomer-free electrolyte) in order to study
the redox behaviour of the conducting polymer.
Typically a pair of broad redox responses is
observed in the voltammogram. The injection
or removal of electrons to or from conducting
polymers results in the formation of polarons
and
bipolarons
in
the
repeating
structure
(commonly
known
as
doping),
producing
considerable
variations
in
the
physical
properties of the polymer itself and imparting
features such as drastic colour changes and
electrical conductivity [89]. The charges thus
generated
along
the
polymer
must
be
compensated
for
by
the
addition
of
neighbouring
ions
(or
dopants)
and
the
insertion and release of such dopants may
induce
volume
changes
in
the
conjugated
polymer. The doping ratio can be estimated
from the amount of charge generated in the
conducting polymers.
222

5.8.5 Electro-reductive Polymerization
of Aromatic Monomers
Aromatic
dihalides
are
representative
monomers for electroreductive polymerization.
Cathodic reduction of an aromatic dihalide
generates
a
radical
anion,
followed
by
polymerization accompanying elimination of
halide (Eq. 5.37). Bond formation takes place at
the specific position of the monomer where the
halogen atom is substituted.
(5.37)
On
electroreductive
polymerization
of
1,4-dibromopyridine, addition of a catalytic
amount of nickel(II) complex is effective and
the
complex
works
as
a
mediator.
Electrogenerated
nickel(0)
promotes
dehalogenation
of
the
dibromopyridine
followed
by
its
polymerization
[96].
Electro-oxidative polymerization of pyridine is
difficult because of its high oxidation potential,
but
this
reductive
polymerization
enables
polypyridines to be produced.
Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) is also synthesized
by electroreductive polymerization. As shown in
Eq.
5.38,
the
electrochemical
reduction
of
α,α,α′,α′-tetrabromo-p-xylene
generates
a
quinodimethane
intermediate
and
its
223

subsequent
polymerization
gives
a
poly(xylylene).
This
is
further
reduced
to
poly(p-phenylene vinylene) [97].
(5.38)
5.8.6 Applications of Conducting
Polymers
The physical properties of conducting polymers
are drastically changed by the doping process.
Table
5.5
summarizes
the
application
of
conducting polymers. The undoped (neutral)
state
of
conducting
polymers
is
generally
semi-conducting, and it can be applied to
material for transistor, photovoltaic cell and
electroluminescence
devices.
On
the
other
hand, electrical conductivity appears in the
doped state of conducting polymers, which is
useful in conducting materials, anti-statics and
capacitor
materials.
The
doping/dedoping
process of conducting polymers is also useful
for
electrochromic
devices,
sensors
and
actuator applications. Application of conducting
polymers for electronics will be described in
Chapter 7.

5.8.7 Electrochemical Synthesis of
Polysilanes
Polysilanes composed of linearly connected
Si–Si
bonds
are
a
class
of
σ-conjugated
polymers and show unique optical properties
[98].
The
Kipping
method,
a
well-known
synthetic method of obtaining polysilanes from
a dichlorosilane, is powerful but the use of Na
metal
is
indispensable.
Electrochemical
reduction
of
chlorotrimethylsilane
affords
hexamethyldisilane
without
the
use
of
a
reducing reagent. Although polymerization of
dichlorosilanes by electrochemical reduction is
rather difficult, the use of an Mg sacrificial
anode results in the effective formation of
polysilanes (Eq. 5.39) [99]. The mechanism
proposed
is
that
Mg2+,once
it
has
been
anodically dissolved from the anode, is reduced
at the cathode to give reactive Mg. This involves
Si–Si bond formation of monomers. Cu and Al
225

are also available as sacrificial anode materials
for reductive polymerization of polysilanes.
(5.39)
Reductive polymerization of dichlorosilanes has
led to a variety of copolymers, such as random
copolymers
of
silane
monomers,
poly(carbosilane)s, and random copolymers of
silane
monomer
and
germane
monomer
(Figure 5.20) [100].

on silane and germane prepared by reductive
polymerization
5.8.8 Chain Polymerization Initiated with
Electrogenerated Reactive Species
Electrogenerated
reactive
species
of
small
molecules can work as polymerization initiators
for ionic and radical polymerization of vinyl
monomers [91]. For example, a methyl radical
generated by Kolbe electrolysis of acetate can be
an initiator for radical polymerization of olefins.
The heterogeneity of initiator concentration in
226

the electrochemical setup makes it difficult to
obtain high molecular weight polymers.
Recent
progress
in
controlled
radical
polymerization using transition metal catalysts
is remarkable both in academia and industry
[101]. As shown in Eq. 5.40, the equilibrium
(ka/kda) between domant species (A) and active
species (B) controlled by redox of a transition
metal catalyst can control the rate of monomer
consumption, resulting in polymerization with
a controlled manner. The external stimuli by
electrochemical oxidation and reduction of the
metal catalyst change the equilibrium and
consequently
more
precise
control
of
polymerization is possible (Eq. 5.40) [102].

Organic Electrosynthesis
242

Toshio Fuchigami, Mahito Atobe and Shinsuke
Inagi
In the 21st century, environmentally friendly
processes are becoming much more important.
The
concept
and
significance
of
green
sustainable
chemistry
(GSC),
which
was
developed in the USA, has been recognized
throughout
the
world,
and
nowadays
new
processes
cannot
be
developed
without
consideration of GSC. Since the latter stages of
the last century, much attention has been paid
to
organic
electrosynthesis
as
a
typical
environmentally friendly process. Furthermore,
in this century, electrolytic reactions with much
lower emission processes and electrochemical
methodologies based on new concepts have
been developed. These related studies have
become an active research area [1].
In this chapter, new methodologies for organic
electrolysis are described. Even though some
methodologies are not very new, they are
mentioned because they are highly useful from
the viewpoint of GSC.
6.1 SPE Electrolysis and Its
Applications
In contrast to organic synthesis, electrolytic
reactions
require
supporting
salts.
It
is
243

troublesome and time-consuming to separate
the
desired
product
from
an
electrolytic
solution
containing
a
large
amount
of
supporting salts. Moreover, supporting salts are
usually not recovered and recycled, and become
waste after electrolysis. In general, supporting
salts are very soluble in polar solvents, but,
depending on the starting organic substrates,
some are not soluble in polar solvents, only in
non-polar solvents. As mentioned previously,
the
correct
choice
of
supporting
salt
and
electrolytic
solvent
is
not
easy.
In
sharp
contrast,
electrolysis
using
solid
polymer
electrolytes
(SPE)
does
not
require
an
electrolytic solution, therefore these problems
are readily solved [2,3].
6.1.1 Principle of SPE Electrolysis
By chemical plating, fine metal particles are
deposited
on
the
surface
of
ion-exchange
membranes like Nafion®, and then a wire
mesh electrode or porous electrode made of the
same metal is pressed on the opposite surface of
the membrane to provide an SPE composite
electrode, which has dual roles of electrode and
supporting salt.
The general advantages of the SPE electrolysis
system for organic synthesis can be described as
follows: (i) to economize the separation and
recycling of a supporting salt and (ii) to avoid
any contamination or side reaction with a
supporting electrolyte. There are two types of
244

SPE systems. In one an electrode is pressed
onto only one side of the surface of the
ion-exchange membrane and in the other two
electrodes are pressed on both surfaces. Figure
6.1 illustrates the latter SPE system. Substrate
AH2 is oxidized at the anode and the resulting
protons migrate through the cation exchange
membrane
to
the
cathode.
Thus,
ionic
conductivity, namely proton conductivity, is
available. The arriving protons are reduced at
the cathode to generate hydrogen gas solely in
the absence of substrate (Figure 6.1a), while
substrate B is reduced to BH2 in the presence of
substrate B (Figure 6.1b). In the latter case, two
products, A and BH2, are obtained from two
starting substrates, AH2 and B, respectively,
therefore this electrolysis can be considered to
be a kind of paired electrosynthesis.
Figure 6.1 Principle of electrolysis using an
SPE system with platinum electrodes
245

In the case of the SPE electrolysis system in
which an electrode is pressed onto only a single
side
of
the
surface
of
an
ion-exchange
membrane, the counter-electrode chamber is
filled with electrolytic solvent. In SPE systems,
even non-polar solvents like hexane can be used
as electrolytic solvents. Furthermore, when the
starting substrate is a liquid or gas, electrolysis
can
be
performed
without
any
solvents.
Moreover, the amount of redox mediator used
can be reduced by immobilizing it on the SPE
composite electrode.
Various organic electrosyntheses using SPE
systems
have
been
reported
to
date,
e.g.
hydrogenation
of
olefins,
reduction
of
nitrobenzene,
Kolbe
electrolysis,
dimethoxylation of furan and ketone synthesis
using a halogen mediator, etc. [2–4]. SPE
electrosynthesis
is
an
energy-efficient
electrolytic method since the cell voltage is low
owing to the small distance between electrodes.
However,
the
durability
of
SPE
composite
electrodes is not high and contamination of the
SPE membrane decreases the current efficiency
and yield. Those problems have not yet been
solved
and
a
commercialized
SPE
organic
electrosynthesis has not been established to
date. The original concept for SPE organic
electrosynthesis is a polymer electrolyte fuel cell
(PEFC).
Thus,
the
development
of
new
materials such as membranes and increased
246

knowledge of fuel cell research should stimulate
the progress of SPE electrosynthesis.
6.1.2 SPE Electrolysis with
Cogeneration (Chemicals Production
Using Fuel Cell Reactions)
The SPE electrolysis system has been applied to
commercialized
water
electrolysis
(water
splitting) and fuel cells. A fuel cell is a device to
convert Gibbs free energy in a chemical reaction
into
electricity
through
electrochemical
reactions. In an H2–O2 fuel cell, electricity is
obtained through the formation of water from
oxygen and hydrogen. This principle suggests
that
catalytic
oxidation
and
reduction
in
chemical synthesis can be converted to fuel cell
reactions
at
an
anode
and
cathode.
For
instance, the Wacker oxidation of ethylene is
catalyzed by redox species like Pd2+/Pd0 and
Cu2+/Cu+, as shown in Figure 6.2. Based on the
flows of protons and electrons in the reaction
scheme, it can be expected that the Wacker
oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde with
oxygen
would
be
possible
using
fuel
cell
reactions, as shown in Figure 6.3.
247

Figure 6.2 Reaction mechanism of the Wacker
oxidation reaction
Figure 6.3 Fuel cell reaction
In fact, ethylene together with water vapour
and oxygen are carried into the left and right
compartments, respectively, as shown in Figure
6.3, and then the circuit is closed. Under these
conditions, current flows and acetaldehyde is
formed highly selectively (95%) at 100°C. Thus,
in this system, both flow of electric current and
autoxidation
of
ethylene
take
place
spontaneously even if potential is not applied.
248

This fuel cell system enables cogeneration of
electricity and chemicals [5].
6.2 Electrolytic Systems Using
Solid Bases and Acids
Ordinary soluble bases are readily oxidized
anodically, but insoluble solid-supported bases
are not oxidized at the anode. Based on this
fact, new electrolytic systems have recently
been developed using recyclable and reusable
solid-supported bases and acids as supporting
electrolytes [5–8]. For instance, as shown in
Figure
6.4,
solid
(silica
gel
or
porous
polystyrene)-supported bases like piperidine
dissociate protic organic solvents like methanol
and acetic acid to protons and anions, and the
resulting protons act as the main carriers of
electronic charge.
Figure 6.4 Dissociation of protic solvents by
solid base
This system is widely applicable to various
anodic
nucleophilic
substitutions,
such
as
methoxylation and acetoxylation of various
compounds (Eq. 6.1). Moreover, it is notable
that after the electrolysis, solid-supported bases
249

are easily separated by only filtration and the
product is readily isolated from the filtrate. The
recovered solid-supported bases can be reused
many times, as shown in Figure 6.5.
(6.1)
Figure 6.5 Recovery and recycle system of
anodic methoxylation and acetoxylation using
solid base
250

6.3 Solid-Supported Mediators
Although mediators have many advantages as
explained in Chapter 2, 3, and 5, they have to be
removed from the electrolytic solution after
electrolysis. However, mediators have never
been recovered after electrolysis for a long time.
Quite recently, disposal-type mediators have
become a problem from GSC, particularly atom
economical aspect. In order to overcome such
problems,
easily
separable
and
recyclable
mediators have been developed.
At
an
early
stage
of
this
approach,
a
cross-linked
poly-4-vinylpyridine
hydrobromide as a solid-supported mediatory
system was developed [9]. As shown Eq. 6.2,
Br−derived from the solid base is anodically
oxidized in an aqueous electrolytic solution to
generate
hypobromide
ion,
BrO−,
which
oxidizes alcohols to give ketones, and then Br−
is regenerated. Thus, the mediator can be easily
recovered as the HBr salt of the solid base.
(6.2)
Since N-oxyl radicals as represented by TEMPO
generally show reversible redox properties, as
shown in Eq. 6.3, they are useful mediators for
251

the oxidation of alcohols. N-Oxyl adsorbed on
the surface of silica gel disperse mediatory
system has been developed (Figure 6.6) [10].
(6.3)
In
this
dispersive
system,
Br−
is
at
first
anodically oxidized to generate Br+, which
oxidizes N-oxyl on the silica gel to form
oxoammonium
ion
(N=O+)
followed
by
oxidation of alcohols to produce ketones. In this
case, the oxidation can be achieved without
organic solvent. One of advantages of the
dispersed
system
is
as
follows.
After
electrolysis, electrolytic solution is filtered and
the
remaining
silica
gel
is
washed
with
appropriate solvents like acetone to provide the
product.
However,
during
washing,
the
mediator also dissolves into the organic solvent.
In order to avoid dissolution of the mediator,
N-oxyl-immobilized silica gel was developed as
a
readily
recyclable
mediator
[11].
N-Oxyl-immobilized
polymer
particles
have
also
been
developed.
Furthermore,
the
combination
of
electrodes
modified
with
TEMPO-immobilized polymer and chiral bases
is known to be highly useful for asymmetric
synthesis [12] (see also section 5.3).
252

N-oxyl-immobilized silica gel
6.4 Biphasic Electrolytic Systems
In
general,
electrochemical
reactions
are
carried
out
in
homogeneous
electrolytic
solutions.
However,
the
electrochemical
reaction
can
be
conducted
even
in
heterogeneous electrolytic solutions unless both
electron transfer and mass transfer processes
are not inhibited by the reaction system. In this
section, we will discuss biphasic electrolytic
systems
such
as
emulsion
electrolysis,
suspension electrolysis, electrolysis using phase
transfer
catalysis
and
the
thermomorphilic
biphase electrolytic reaction system [13–15].
6.4.1 Emulsion Electrolysis
As shown in Figure 6.7, when the product is an
oxidizable and reducible compound such as an
aldehyde,
an
organic
phase
in
a
biphasic
253

electrolytic
system
(in
general,
a
system
composed of organic and water phases in which
organic droplets are finely dispersed into water
(aqueous electrolyte)) is often used to extract
the
product
in
order
to
prevent
its
overoxidation
or
over-reduction
at
the
electrode.
Figure 6.7 Emulsion electrolysis
On
the
other
hand,
immiscible
organic
compounds
are
often
electrolyzed
in
their
emulsion.
However,
in
these
cases,
the
emulsion contributes to maintain the saturated
concentration of immiscible organic substrate
in an aqueous electrolyte and the emulsified
droplet itself is not directly electrolyzed at the
electrode.
Unlike the above emulsion electrolytic systems,
the direct electrolysis of the emulsified droplets
can also take place at the electrode if the
droplets contain supporting electrolytes and
their presence allows the formation of an
254

electric bilayer inside the droplets. However, in
this case, droplets should be miniaturized to the
sub-micrometre range by the use of special
surfactants or ultrasonication in order to obtain
a practical reaction rate [13].
6.4.2 Suspension Electrolysis
The
direct
electrolysis
of
suspensions
of
non-electronconductive solid materials such as
most organic compounds cannot take place in
principle,
since
electrochemical
electron
transfer
between
a
solid
electrode
and
a
non-conductive solid particle hardly ever occurs
even when they contact with each other. On the
other
hand,
the
indirect
electrolysis
of
suspended solid particles using soluble redox
mediators may be able to take place, since this
consists of a series sequence of two possible
electrochemical and chemical electron-transfer
steps between solid and liquid phases (electrode
(solid)–dissolved mediator (liquid)–suspending
particle (solid)) (Figure 6.8) [14]. Similarly to
this case, the electrolysis of emulsified liquid
droplets
can
be
conducted
by
using
electron-transfer mediators.
255

Figure 6.8 Suspension electrolysis
6.4.3 Electrolysis Using Phase-Transfer
Catalysis
Anodic
aromatic
substitutions
have
been
carried out using dispersions of an organic
solvent (usually methylene chloride) in aqueous
media. Current flow takes place mainly through
the
relatively
conducting
aqueous
phase
(thereby
lowering
power
costs)
while
the
synthetic reactions have been assumed to be
confined to the organic phase; the function of
the phase-transfer catalyst is to transfer with
anions into the organic phase both to confer
adequate conductivity to this phase and to
provide
the
coupling
agent
(e.g.
CN−
or
CH3COO−) for the intermediates generated
from the aromatic substrates (Figure 6.9).

Electrochemical Reaction System

thermomorphic
biphasic

reaction systems composed of organic solvents
of
different
polarity
(e.g.
cyclohexane–nitroalkanes) [15]. As shown in
Figure
6.10,
in
the
thermally
immixed
homogeneous electrolyte solution, the anodic
desulfurization
proceeds
smoothly
to
give
o-quinone
methide,
and
then
reacts
with
terpene to give the cycloadduct as a final
product.
After
the
completion
of
the
electrolysis, the product as the cyclohexane
solution
can
be
separated
from
the
polar
electrolytic solution (nitroalkane phase) simply
by on-cooling phase separation. In addition, the
separated polar electrolytic solution can be
reused for the next cycle of the reaction.

6.5 Cation Pool Method
Electro-oxidatively generated carbocations can
react with nucleophiles to form covalent bonds.
Because of the short life-time of carbocations, it
is necessary to generate carbocations in the
presence
of
nucleophiles,
followed
by
immediate reaction. In the above system, the
nucleophiles used should have higher oxidation
potential
than
precursor
molecules
of
carbocation. Since the carbon nucleophile is
easily oxidized, the formation of carbon–carbon
bonds using carbocations generated by anodic
oxidation is generally difficult.
258

The
cation
pool
method
can
preserve
carbocations
stabilized
by
neighbouring
heteroatoms or aromatics at low temperature
(–78°C) without decomposition. Addition of
nucleophiles
to
the
cation
pool
results
in
desirable nucleophilic reaction (Figure 6.11)
[16,17].
Figure 6.11 Nucleophilic substitution reaction
by the cation pool method
At
low
temperature,
the
viscosity
of
the
electrolytic
solution
increases
and
this
decreases the ionic conductivity of the solution.
Dichloromethane is a suitable solvent for the
cation
pool
method
that
has
sufficient
conductivity for electrolysis. With a divided
electrolytic cell, the substrate is injected into
the
anode
chamber
and
trifluoromethane
sulfonic acid (the proton source) is injected into
the cathodic chamber to promote a sacrificial
cathodic reaction.
A
variety
of
cation
pools
are
successfully
generated, as shown in Figure 6.12. The cation
pool of alkoxycarbenium ions is obtained by
anodic
oxidation
of
α-silyl
ethers
at
low
temperature, and the addition of allylsilanes as
carbon nucleophiles yields the desired products
259

efficiently. Similarly, an N-acyliminium ion
pool
and
a
diarylcarbenium
ion
pool
are
available
for
the
resulting
chemical
transformations. Figure 6.13 shows examples of
nucleophilic
reactions
of
accumulated
N-acylcarbenium ion species.
Figure 6.12 Examples of cation pools
Figure
6.13
Various
reactions
of
the
N-acyliminium cation ion pool
The concept of the cation pool method can be
extended
to
a
cation
flow
method
in
combination with a micro-reactor system (see
260

section 6.8). This method makes it possible not
only
to
survey
short-life
intermediates
generated electrochemically but also to realize
the combinatorial synthesis of useful materials.
6.6 Template-Directed Methods
In
general,
a
regioselective
intermolecular
coupling reaction is difficult compared to an
intramolecular
one.
Template-directed
reactions via intramolecular reactions enable
selective coupling reactions that are otherwise
difficult to achieve. As shown in Figure 6.4,
regioselective anodic coupling of phenols can be
achieved using a boron template [18]. First, the
template, tetraphenoxyborate, is prepared in a
one-pot-procedure
and
then
its
anodic
oxidation followed by hydrolysis provides an
ortho-ortho coupled product selectively.
(6.4)
A silicon template is also known [19].
261

6.7 Electrolysis in Supercritical
Fluids
The
commercialization
of
electrosynthetic
processes has been restricted by the limited
solubility
of
substrates
and
products
in
conventional electrolytic solutions, the poor
interphase
mass
transport
characteristics
associated with the two-phase system in which
the reaction occurs at solid (electrode)–liquid
(electrolyte) interfaces, the low selectivity of the
desired reaction products and the complex
processing
schemes
often
used
to
recover
products.
Supercritical fluid solvents can overcome many
of the limitations associated with conventional
solvents such as water and organic solvents.
Supercritical
fluids
have
traditionally
been
applied to chromatography, extraction, cleaning
and so on [20]. Moreover, they are becoming
widely recognized as useful media for organic
and polymer syntheses in a range of laboratory
and industrial processes because of their low
toxicity, ease of solvent removal, potential for
recycling and variation of reaction rates [21,22].
A supercritical fluid can be defined as any
substance that is above its critical temperature
(Tc) and critical pressure (Pc), and exists as a
single
phase
(Figure
6.14).
The
physico-chemical properties of a supercritical
fluid are between those of liquids and gases,
262

and they can vary between those exhibited by
gases to liquid-like values by small changes in
pressure and temperature [20]. For example,
supercritical fluids exhibit larger diffusivility
and lower viscosity than conventional liquids.
Consequently,
interphase
mass
transfer
resistance is also lower relative to the liquid
solvent. On the other hand, substrates and
products that are sparingly soluble in the liquid
phase can become significantly more soluble in
supercritical fluids. Such unique and useful
properties of the fluids make them viable
solvent media for electrosynthesis.
Figure
6.14
Pressure–temperature
phase
diagram
263

Conventional supercritical solvents, such as
carbon dioxide and ethane, have mild critical
conditions, but they lack the ability to solvate
polar electrolytes. A reaction medium should
therefore generally be designed by mixing with
co-solvent such as methanol [23], ethanol [24],
acetone [24], acetonitrile [25] or DMF [26] to
produce a suitable electrolytic solution.
Dombro et al. reported that dimethyl carbonate
has
been
electrosynthesized
from
carbon
monoxide
and
methanol
in
a
supercritical
carbon dioxide–methanol medium (Eq. 6.5)
[27].
They
added
0.35
mole
fraction
of
methanol to supercritical carbon dioxide to
produce a mixture capable of dissolving an
ammonium salt. Such a mixture is capable of
ionic
conductivity
and
the
electrolysis
proceeded
smoothly
to
afford
dimethyl
carbonate in an excellent current efficiency
(near 100%).
(6.5)
In another example, Tokuda et al. reported
electrochemical
carboxylation
of
benzyl
chloride,
cinnamyl
chloride
and
2-chloronaphtalene
in
supercritical
carbon
dioxide–DMF media (Eqs. 6.6–6.8) [26]. A
mixture used in this work also exhibited the
ability
to
solvate
polar
electrolytes
like
ammonium salts. In these reactions, since
264

carbon dioxide plays the role of a reactant,
CO2-rich
conditions
such
as
supercritical
conditions are suitable for improving product
yields.
(6.6)
(6.7)
(6.8)
As mentioned above, conventional supercritical
fluids like supercritical carbon dioxide are the
low dielectric constant of the fluid. Hence,
many supporting electrolytes are usually hard
to dissolve in the fluid. A polar organic solvent
should therefore be added to the fluid to
produce
a
suitable
electrolytic
solution.
However, the inclusion of a co-solvent limits
the accessible potential range and introduces
complications.
The
use
of
supercritical
265

fluorinated
hydrocarbons
is
an
attractive
alternative which avoids these problems. For
example,
supercritical
fluoroform
exhibits
relatively
high
solubility
and
its
dielectric
constant can be controlled from 1 to 7 by
manipulating either the temperature or the
pressure of scCHF3 without any additives like
polar solvents [28]. Supercritical fluoroform
has therefore been used as the reaction medium
in electrochemical syntheses.
Atobe
et
al.
reported
the
electrochemical
synthesis of polypyrrole and polythiophene in
supercritical
fluoroform
[29].
Both
the
corresponding
monomers
(pyrrole
and
thiophene) can be electropolymerized faster in
supercritical fluoroform than in a conventional
organic media like acetonitrile solution, and the
films obtained have a highly uniform structure
(Figure 6.15).
Figure 6.15 SEM photographs of polypyrrole
films polymerized in (a) acetonitrile and (b)
supercritical fluoroform solutions
266

Moreover, Atobe et al. successfully prepared a
polythiophene
nano-brush
using
template
electrochemical polymerization in supercritical
fluoroform (Figure 6.16) [30]. In this work,
nanoporous alumina membranes (60 µm thick,
200 nm pore size) coated on one side with
evaporated Pt (about 500 nm thick) were
employed
as
a
template
electrode
for
polythiophene electrodeposition into pores. The
use of the special properties of the fluids such
as
higher
diffusivility
and
lower
viscosity
enabled effective monomer transport into the
porous template and nanoprecise filling with
the
polymers.
Consequently,
the
solid
polythiophene nano-brush was obtained after
removal of the alumina membrane.

6.8 Electrolysis in Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids consist of cations and anions
without any solvent, and they are in a liquid
267

state around room temperature. Since ionic
liquids
have
unique
properties
like
non-flammability,
thermal
stability,
non-volatility and reusability, they have been
intensively studied as a green solvent from
basic and applied aspects [31–35]. Since they
have
also
good
electroconductivity,
much
attention has been paid to their application in
organic
electrochemical
devices.
In
fact,
intensive
studies
on
applications
to
rechargeable
lithium
batteries,
electric
double-layer capacitors, wet solar cells and fuel
cells have recently been carried out.
In this section, the structures and physical
properties of ionic liquids are explained and
their application to electrolytic reactions is
described.
6.8.1 Structures of Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids are roughly classified into two
families based on kinds of cations. One consists
of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cations
and the other consists of aliphatic ammonium
cations. Aliphatic ionic liquids are subdivided
into open-chain and cyclic. Based on kinds of
anions, ionic liquids are divided into five
classes:
chloroalminate,
fluoroinorganic,
fluoroorganic,
poly(hydrogen
fluoride)
and
non-fluoroionic.
In
addition,
recently
phosphine-containing
ionic
liquids
like
phosphonium salts have been prepared, and
various novel types of ionic liquids with other
268

new anions have been continuously developed
(Figure 6.17).
Figure 6.17 Typical examples of the structures
of ionic liquids and their abbreviations
6.8.2 Hydrophilicity and Hydrophobicity
of Ionic Liquids
Ionic
liquids
can
also
be
classified
as
hydrophilic or hydrophobic, as shown in Table
6.1. Regardless of cation type, ionic liquids
having BF4−and CF3SO3−as an anion are
hydrophilic
while
those
with
PF6−
and
(CF3SO2)2N−
are
hydrophobic.
As
a
characteristic
property,
hydrophobic
ionic
liquids are miscible with neither water nor
ordinary organic solvents like ether and hexane,
and hence they make phase separation resulting
in formation of three phases. The products can
therefore
be
separated
by
liquid–liquid
269

extraction, which is one of the big advantages of
ionic liquids.

In the case of the widely used imidazolium ionic
liquids,
the
relationship
between
their
molecular structures and physical properties,
such
as
melting
point,
viscosity
and
electroconductivity, is as follows.
With increasing alkyl chain length the
viscosity increases while the melting point
and electroconductivity decrease. However,
the relationship between melting point and
alkyl chain length is not always observed, as
shown in Figure 6.18. In order to decrease
the melting point an unsymmetrical or bulky
270

cation should be used, which results in a
weak columbic interaction between cation
and anion.
Figure 6.18 Relationship between alkyl
chain length of imidazolinium salt ionic
liquids and physical properties (viscosity,
melting point and electroconductivity)
When a methyl group is introduced to the
2-position of the imidazolium ring,
hydrogen bonding at the 2-position cannot
occur. The melting point does not decrease
unexpectedly but increases. Thus, the
relationship between hydrogen bonding and
melting point has not yet been clarified.
When an alkyl group is introduced to the
2-position of the imidazolium ring, the
reduction of the ring becomes difficult but
oxidation becomes easier. Moreover, when
the imidazolium ion as cation is changed to
an aliphatic ammonium ion, the oxidative
resistance increases, and the viscosity and
melting point also increase. Regarding the
viscosity, imidazolium ionic liquids have the
lowest viscosity among various types of ionic
liquids at the present time (Figure 6.19).

6.8.3 Polarity of Ionic Liquids
The polarity of ionic liquids can be estimated by
the energy difference,
between the ground
state and the excited state of Reichrdt dye,
which
is
commonly
used
for
the
polarity
evaluation of ordinary solvents. The polarity of
imidazolium ionic liquids and pyridinium ionic
liquids is similar to that of ethanol, and is a
little lower than that of methanol. However,
their polarity is much higher than that of MeCN
and DMF, therefore it is equivalent to that of
protic solvents. The polarity of ionic liquids and
organic solvents can be illustrated as follows:

6.8.4 Electrochemical Properties of Ionic
Liquids
Although
the
electroconductivity
of
a
non-aqueous electrolyte is lower than that of an
aqueous
one,
as
shown
in
Table
6.2,
non-aqueous electrolytes have the advantage of
a wide usable potential window. Accordingly,
ionic
liquids
belong
to
non-aqueous
electrolytes.

As shown in Table 6.3, imidazolium ionic
liquids
generally
have
relatively
good
273

electroconductivity,
while
poly(hydrogen
fluoride) salt ionic liquids exhibit rather good
electroconductivity regardless of cation (Table
6.4). 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (emim) salts
show the highest electroconductivity at room
temperature among the series of ionic liquids.
Furthermore, since the electroconductivity of
ionic liquids is correlated with the mobility of
ions, it greatly depends on the viscosity of ionic
liquids. Accordingly, the molecular design of
ionic liquids with low viscosity is of great
importance. Aliphatic ammonium ionic liquids
exhibit lower conductivity since they generally
have
a
higher
viscosity
compared
to
imidazolium ionic liquids. In contrast, ionic
liquids with poly(hydrogen fluoride) as the
anion
have
extremely
low
viscosity,
and
therefore
have
good
low-temperature
properties.

In the relationship
between the molecular
structure and conductivity of imidazolium ionic
liquid,
viscosity
increases
with
increase
in
bulkiness of the N-alkyl group attached to the
imidazolium
ring,
resulting
in
a
drastic
decrease in electroconductivity. On the other
hand, even though the N-alkyl group is replaced
with a hydrogen atom, which is smaller than the
methyl group, the viscosity increases owing to
hydrogen bonding with the counter anion. The
conductivity is therefore not improved. The
Walden role, in which the product of mobility
and viscosity is constant, can be applied to ionic
liquids, and molar electroconductivity against
viscosity of ionic liquids obeys the following
equation:
Accordingly, the conductivity of ionic liquids
increases
with
decreasing
viscosity.
It
is
reasonable that the viscosity changes depending
on temperature, and the electroconductivity of
276

ionic liquids (emim salts) drastically decreases
as temperature is decreased, as shown in Figure
6.20. This is due to the rapid increase in their
viscosity with decreasing temperature. This
trend
causes
a
big
problem
when
electrochemical
devices
like
batteries
and
capacitors that use ionic liquids as electrolytes
are utilized during winter in a cold area. The
development of ionic liquids with excellent
conductivity is eagerly anticipated.

277

Ionic liquids are electrochemically stable and
their usable potential region, i.e. their potential
window where the ionic liquid itself can be
neither oxidized nor reduced, is very large. This
is one of the characteristics of ionic liquids. In
general, oxidative stability depends on the
anion while reductive stability depends on the
cation. However, although the imidazolium ion
has a positive charge, it is more easily oxidized
compared to BF4−owing to the unsaturated
bonds of the imidazole ring. Accordingly, the
oxidative stability of imidazolium ionic liquids
is not always attributable to the oxidative
decomposition
of
anions.
Among
organic
anions, trifluoroacetate ion is the most easily
decomposed oxidatively, while (CF3SO2)2N−
and (CF3SO2)3C−have oxidation resistivity and
are not easily decomposed oxidatively. The
order of oxidation resistivity is as follows, and
this
order
agrees
with
that
of
oxidation
potentials measured in a solution:
On the other hand, reductive stability generally
depends on the reductive decomposition of the
cation and the aliphatic ammonium ion is more
difficult to reduce compared to the imidazolium
ion. 2-Methylimidazolium ion is more difficult
to
reduce
by
0.3–0.5
V
compared
a
non-substituted imidazolium ion. As shown in
Figure 6.21, ionic liquids consisting of an
278

aliphatic ammonium ion and (CF3SO2)2N−
(TFSA) have wide potential window of about 6
V.
Figure 6.21 Linear sweep voltammograms in
various ionic liquids
Phosphonium ionic liquids are superior to
aliphatic ammonium ionic liquids in oxidation
resistance, and they have a wide potential
window (about 6.5 V) as well as thermal
stability.
Poly(hydrogen
fluoride)
salt
ionic
liquids,
however, have a narrow negative potential
window because of the reduction of acidic
proton, as shown in Figure 6.22, but such easy
proton
reduction
assists
electrochemical
fluorination preferentially (see sections 5.7 and
5.8.6). Et3N-3HF is easily oxidized because of
279

contaminated free amine, while Et4NF-4HF
and
Et3N-5HF
have
excellent
oxidation
resistance,
and
their
protons
are
readily
reduced at the cathode to generate hydrogen
gas.

6.8.5 Voltammetry in Ionic Liquids
When ionic liquids are used as a solvent for the
measurement of the cyclic voltammetry of
organic
compounds,
the
observed
redox
currents are generally extremely small. This is
due to the high viscosity of ionic liquids, which
decreases the diffusion coefficient. For instance,
280

the diffusion coefficient for Ni(II) salen in ionic
liquid [bmim]BF4 at room temperature is 1.8 ×
10−8 cm2 s−1, which is more than 500 times
smaller
than
that
in
a
typical
organic
solvent–electrolyte
system
like
0.1
M
Et4NClO4/DMF [36].
6.8.6 Organic Electrochemical
Reactions in Ionic Liquids
Although ionic liquids are considered to be an
ideal medium for organic electrolytic reactions
because of their non-flammability and sufficient
electroconductivity as well as wide potential
windows, there have not yet been many reports
of organic electrochemical reactions in ionic
liquids.
6.8.6.1 Organic Electrosynthesis
Cathodic reduction of carbonyl compounds like
benzaldehyde
and
acetophenone
has
been
investigated in ionic liquids, and notably their
dimerization proceeded predominantly [37,38].
For acetophenone, the corresponding pinacol
was formed as a diastereomeric mixture, and
the diastereoselectivity is greatly affected by the
ionic liquids used, as shown in Eq. 6.9 [37]. As a
solvent, aliphatic ionic liquids result in higher
diastereoselectivity compared to aromatic ionic
liquids.
281

(6.9)
Electrocatalytic
homocoupling
of
PhBr
and
PhCH2Br can be carried out in the presence of
NiCl(bpy) complex in [bmim]Tf2N, as shown in
Eq. 6.10 [39].
(6.10)
Interestingly,
Pd
nanoparticles
generated
cathodically in ionic liquid were shown to be a
highly effective ligand-free catalyst for the
coupling of aryl halides [40].
Electroreductive
dehalogenation
of
vic-dihalides using a Co(II)salen complex in
[bmim]BF4 has also been achieved, as shown in
Eq. 6.11 [41]. The product isolation is much
easier compared to the similar dehalogenation
282

in
ordinary
molecular
solvents
since
the
Co(II)salen complex remains in the ionic liquid
phase during product extraction with non-polar
organic
solvents
like
diethyl
ether.
Furthermore, the recyclability of the catalyst/
ionic liquid system was demonstrated.
(6.11)
Cyclic carbonates are prepared by the reduction
of CO2 at −2.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the presence of
epoxides
in
various
ionic
liquids
like
[emim]BF4,
[bmim]PF6
and
[BPy]BF4
(BPy=n-butylpyridinium) using a Cu cathode
and a Mg or Al anode [42].
Electrochemical synthesis of carbamates was
also achieved by the electrolysis of a solution of
CO2 and amine in [bmim]BF4 followed by the
addition of alkylating agent, as shown in Eq.
6.12 [43].
283

(6.12)
Furthermore, a kinetic study on the anodic
coupling of aromatic compounds has been
carried out in ionic liquids. Anodic oxidation of
1,2-dimethoxybenzene led to the corresponding
trimer, as shown in Eq. 6.13 [44]. In this
reaction, the dimerization rate in ionic liquid is
five
to
ten
times
smaller
than
that
in
acetonitrile because of the high viscosity of the
ionic liquid.
(6.13)
N-Heterocyclic carbenes can be generated by
cathodic
reduction
of
imidazolinium-based
ionic liquids [45–47]. The resulting carbenes
are stable bases that are able to catalyze the
Henry reaction as shown in Eq. 6.14 [47].
284

(6.14)
Since ionic liquids generally have much higher
viscosities, mass transport is quite slow, as
described before. This is a disadvantage for
electrosynthesis in ionic liquids. However, it
was
found
that
cathodic
reduction
of
N-methylphthalimide
was
promoted
under
ultrasonication,
resulting
higher
conversion
and current efficiency, as shown in Eq. 6.15
[48]. This is due to facilitated mass transport of
the substrate under ultrasonication.
(6.15)
6.8.6.2 Electrochemical Fluorination
Poly(hydrogen
fluoride)
salts
consisting
of
amine and ammonium fluoride and hydrogen
fluoride (Et3N-nHF, n = 3–5; Et4NF-nHF, n =
3–5)
are
ionic
liquids
that
have
good
285

conductivity because of their low viscosity
[49,50]. They become more anodically stable
with increasing HF content (increasing n). As
described
in
Chapter
5,
conventional
electrochemical fluorination has been carried
out in organic solvents containing fluoride salts,
such as Et3N-3HF and Et4NF-3HF [49–51].
However, anodic passivation (the formation of
a non-conducting polymer film on the electrode
surface that suppresses Faradaic current) takes
place often, resulting in poor yield and low
current efficiency. Moreover, acetoamidation
also occurs preferentially when MeCN is used
as an electrolytic solvent. In order to overcome
such
problems,
solvent-free
electrochemical
fluorination
is
an
alternative
method
of
preventing
anode
passivation
and
acetoamidation.
Solvent-free
selective
electrochemical
fluorination
of
benzenes,
naphthalene, olefins, furan, benzofuran and
phenanthroline was first achieved in less than
50% yield using the ionic liquid Et3N–3HF as
the reaction medium, supporting electrolyte
and a fluorine source [52].
Although Et3N-3HF and Et4NF-3HF are easily
oxidized (lower or around 2 V vs. Ag/Ag+),
anodically very stable poly(hydrogen fluoride)
salts, Et4NF-mHF (m > 3.5) and Et3N-5HF (3 V
vs. Ag/Ag+) have also been developed [50].
Using ionic liquid Et4NF-mHF (m > 3.5),
solvent-free
anodic
partial
fluorination
of
286

arenes such as various substituted benzenes,
toluene and quinolines was successfully carried
out at high current densities with good current
efficiencies (66–90%) [53,54]. As shown in Eq.
6.16, monofluorotoluene and difluorotoluene
are
formed
successively
with
increasing
electricity, however, even when the electricity is
increased further trifluorotoluene is not formed
and ring fluorination starts [54].
(6.16)
Selective
electrochemical
formyl
hydrogen-exchange
fluorination
of
aliphatic
aldehydes
affords
acyl
fluorides
using
Et3N–5HF [55]. Selective anodic fluorination of
cyclic unsaturated esters in Et3N–5HF is also
accomplished
to
provide
ring-expansion
fluorinated products, as shown in Eq. 6.17
[56,57].
(6.17)
287

Furthermore, anodic fluorination of various
phenol
derivatives
can
be
performed
in
Et3N-5HF using carbon fibre cloth as an anode
to
form
4,4-difluorocyclohexadienone
derivatives in good yields (Eq. 6.18) [58].
(6.18)
Electrochemical fluorination of adamantanes is
also possible in Et3N–5HF. Mono-, di-, tri- and
tetrafluoroadamantanes
were
selectively
prepared
from
adamantanes
by
controlling
oxidation potentials, and the fluorine atoms
were
introduced
selectively
at
the
tertiary
carbons, as shown in Eq. 6.19 [59].
(6.19)
Anodic fluorination of cyclic ethers, lactones
and open-chain and cyclic carbonates can be
achieved by anodic oxidation of a mixture of a
large amount of the liquid substrate and a small
288

amount of Et4NF–4HF (only 1.5–1.7 equiv. of
F−to the substrate) at a high current density
(150 mA cm−2) (Eqs. 6.20 and 6.21) [60]. In
this
method,
the
substrate
was
selectively
oxidized
to
provide
the
corresponding
monofluorinated product in good yield and with
good current efficiency. In sharp contrast, the
use of organic solvents or a large amount of
Et4NF-4HF resulted in no formation or low
yield (about 10%) of the desired fluorinated
product. Isolation of the fluorinated products is
easy: fluorinated lactone and carbonates can be
isolated
by
extraction
with
solvent,
while
fluorinated
tetrahydrofuran
can
be
easily
isolated by distillation of the reaction mixture
after electrolysis. In these cases, the substrates
are predominantly oxidized to result in efficient
fluorination because only a small amount of
supporting fluoride salt is used. Since platinum
with a low hydrogen overpotential is used as a
cathode, the acidic protons of the ionic fluoride
salt are predominantly reduced at the cathode
to generate hydrogen gas, hence a separator for
the electrolysis is not necessary. As explained, a
small amount of fluoride salt is enough for the
fluorination, therefore this fluorination method
is
desirable
from
an
atom
economical
perspective.
289

(6.20)
(6.21)
Since phthalide is hardly oxidized (
vs. SCE), anodic fluorination does not proceed
in either organic solvent or a solvent-free
system.
However,
fluorination
takes
place
highly efficiently in a double ionic liquid system
consisting of [emim]OTf and Et3N-5HF, as
290

shown in Eq. 6.22 [61]. In this double ionic
system, the cationic intermediate generated
from the phthalide was expected to have a TfO−
counter anion (activated cation A in Eq. 6.22),
which readily reacted with F−to provide the
fluorinated phthalide in good to excellent yield.
(6.22)
The viscosity of ionic liquid fluoride salts is
higher than that of ordinary organic solvents,
therefore the mass transport of substrates to
the anode surface from the bulk liquid is slower
than in organic solvents, which is unfavourable
for electrolytic reactions.
As mentioned in section 6.11, it is known that
ultrasonication
greatly
enhances
mass
transport from bulk to electrode surface. This
effect can also be applied to an ionic liquid
system as the efficiency of anodic fluorination
in
ionic
liquid
fluoride
salts
is
markedly
increased, as shown in Eq. 6.23 [62]. Notably,
anodic
difluorination
of
ethyl
α-(phenylthio)acetate proceeds efficiently even
in readily oxidizable ionic liquid, Et3N-3HF,
which is not suitable for difluorination.
291

(6.23)
In
neat
ionic
liquid
fluoride
salts,
the
nucleophilicity of fluoride ions is rather low,
resulting in poor fluorination yields. It has been
demonstrated that ether solvents like DME
enhance the nucleophilicity of fluoride ions, but
DME is rather easily decomposed [63]. In
contrast, PEG and even its oligomer are stable
against anodic oxidation, and it was found that
the addition of only about 3% PEG oligomer to
the reaction system greatly improved the yield
due to its ability to coordinate the counter
cations of fluoride ions, as shown Eq. 6.24 [64].
(6.24)
Severe passivation of the anode often occurs
even in ionic liquid HF salts. Use of mediators
292

is effective to solve the problem, but product
separation becomes complicated. Fuchigami
and co-workers have developed a novel indirect
anodic
fluorination
system
employing
a
task-specific ionic liquid with an iodoarene
moiety as the mediator in HF salts [65]. The
mediator improved the reaction efficiency for a
variety of electrochemical fluorinations (Figure
6.23) and remained intact in the ionic liquids
after the product extraction process for reuse in
subsequent runs.
Figure
6.23
Electrochemical
fluorination
using task-specific ionic liquid with mediator
In addition, a polymer-supported iodobenzene
(PSIB) mediator is also effective for indirect
anodic fluorination in HF salts [66]. In this
case, the iodobenzene moiety pendent from the
solid
polymer
support
cannot
be
directly
oxidized, therefore a double mediator system is
necessary. As shown in Figure 6.24, anodic
oxidation of Cl−gave Cl+, which reacted with
293

the iodobenzene moiety to form PhI+Cl. This
species then captures a fluoride ion to give the
hypervalent
[(chloro)(fluoro)iodo]
benzene
moiety. The hypervalent iodine moiety thus
generated
oxidizes
the
substrate
and
consequently the starting PSIB is recovered.
The recovered PSIB mediator is reused in
subsequent runs, maintaining a good yield
(about 90%) of the fluorinated product.

6.8.6.3 Electropolymerization
Mattes's
group
and
Fuchigami's
group
independently
achieved
the
electrooxidative
polymerization
of
pyrrole,
thiophene
and
aniline
in
different
ionic
liquids
[67–69].
Mattes's
group
used
1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
and
hexafluorophosphate
([bmim]BF4
and
[bmim]PF6)
for
electropolymerization
of
pyrrole
and
aniline.
They
found
that
the
π-conjugated polymers thus obtained are highly
stable and can be electrochemically cycled in
294

ionic liquids up to a million times [67]. In
addition,
because
the
polymers
have
cycle-switching speeds as fast as 100 ms, they
can be used as electrochromic windows and
numeric
displays.
Furthermore,
it
was
demonstrated that polyaniline prepared in this
way
is
highly
useful
for
electrochemical
actuators. A 10-mm length of 59-µm diameter
wet-spun polyaniline emeraldine base (EB)
fibre is treated with trifluoromethanesulfonic
(triflic)
acid
to
form
the
corresponding
emeraldine salt (ES) fibre, which has high
conductivity of 300 S cm−1. The fibre with ES
structure is reduced with two electrons at about
−0.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ionic liquid [bmim]BF4 to
form leucoemeraldine (LE), and LE is oxidized
at about +0.8 V vs. Ag/Ag+ to form original ES,
as shown in Figure 6.25. Thus, by oxidation and
reduction,
the
cation
of
the
ionic
liquid,
[bmim],
is
expelled
and
incorporated,
respectively. The strain is therefore contractile
when the polymer is oxidized from the fully
reduced LE state to ES, and expansive upon
reduction (Figure 6.25). In lifetime tests of the
fibre,
both
electroactivity
and
electromechanical actuation continue without
significant decrease (<1%) in either stress or
strain
for
10,000
redox
cycles
because
anhydrous ionic liquid is used as a solvent. The
π-conjugated
polymer
in
an
ionic
liquid
electrolyte system is therefore highly promising
for electrochemical mechanical actuators.
295

Figure 6.25 Principle of an electrochemical
actuator
Fuchigami's group employed [emim]OTf for
electrochemical polymerization [68,69]. They
found that the polymerization of pyrrole in
ionic liquid proceeds much faster than that in
conventional
media
like
aqueous
and
acetonitrile
solutions
containing
0.1
M
[emim]OTf
as
a
supporting
electrolyte.
Interestingly, as shown in Table 6.5, the surface
of
the
polypyrrole
film
prepared
in
neat
[emim]OTf is so smooth that no grains are
observed, and both the electrochemical capacity
and
the
electroconductivity
are
markedly
increased
when
the
polypyrrole
and
polythiophene films are prepared in the ionic
liquid.
This
may
be
attributable
to
the
extremely
high concentration
of anions
as
dopants, which results in a much higher doping
level.
As
described
above,
polymer
films
prepared in the ionic liquid have a higher
296

electrochemical density and highly regulated
morphological structures, and therefore they
have
possible
uses
as
high-performance
electrochemical capacitors, ion-sieving films,
ion-selective electrodes, matrices for hosting
catalyst particles and so on.

(PEDOT)
and polyphenylene in ionic liquids has been
reported [71,72].
297

An ionic liquid is a recyclable medium for
organic
synthesis,
which
is
one
of
the
pronounced characteristics of ionic liquids.
However, when an ionic liquid is used as
electrolytic medium, decomposition of the ionic
liquid itself often occurs at a counter electrode.
This is a big problem when the ionic liquid is
recycled.
In
the
case
of
electrochemical
polymerization, however, this problem can be
solved using cyclic potential-scanning oxidative
polymerization. In this polymerization method,
monomer is oxidized to form polymer film,
which deposits on the electrode. Additionally,
the deposited polymer itself is oxidized and
reduced repeatedly during alternately anodic
and cathodic scanning. During reduction at the
working
electrode,
anodic
oxidative
polymerization of monomer and oxidation of
the polymer itself (so-called doping) therefore
occur at the counter electrode, while during
oxidation at the working electrode, reduction of
the polymer (so-called dedoping) occurs at the
counter electrode, hence decomposition of the
ionic liquid does not occur. Ionic liquid is
therefore easily recovered simply by extracting
the
remaining
monomer
with
appropriate
solvents, and recovered ionic liquid can be used
many times [68,69].
6.8.6.4 Others
Although the following synthetic application of
ionic liquids is not for organic substances,
298

electrochemical deposition of various metals in
ionic liquids is possible. For instance, Zn, Ga
and In can be electrochemically deposited from
mixtures of [emim]Cl and ZnCl2, GaCl3 and
InCl3, respectively. A variety of typical elements
and transition metals can be deposited from
ionic liquids other than chloride ionic liquid.
Furthermore, it is known that one-electron
electrochemical reduction of oxygen molecules
in
ionic
liquids
generates
superoxide
ions
efficiently.
6.9 Thin-Layer Electrolytic Cells
Although electro-organic syntheses have been
established
as
a
powerful
tool
in
organic
syntheses, they still are in development to fulfil
their potential as a ‘green’ methodology. In
conventional electrosynthetic processes, a large
amount of supporting electrolyte has to be
added to the solvent to give sufficient electrical
conductivity, but the presence of a large amount
of
the
supporting
electrolyte
might
cause
separation problems in the reaction mixture
work-up and additional waste problems.
The capillary gap cell developed at BASF for the
commercial
electrosynthetic
process
(paired
electrosynthesis
of
phthalide
and
t-butylbenzaldehyde) allows the electrolysis to
be
conducted
even
in
a
dilute
electrolyte
solution. The cell consists of circular disk
electrodes with a small interelectrode gap (1–2
299

mm) to minimize the ohmic voltage drop in the
electrolyte (Figure 6.26) [73].

capillary gap electrochemical cell of BASF SE
On
the
other
hand,
in
laboratory-scale
experiments, the use of a simple thin-layer
flow-cell geometry with working and auxiliary
electrodes directly facing each other allows
electrosynthetic processes to be conducted in
flow-through
mode
in
the
absence
of
supporting electrolyte (Figure 6.27) [74]. For
example,
by
using
this
type
of
cell,
the
methoxylation of furan is conducted anodically
in methanolic solution even in the absence of
added supporting electrolyte [75].

6.10 Electrochemical Microflow
Systems
Recently,
microflow
systems
have
received
significant
research
interest
from
both
academia
and
industry.
The
fundamental
advantages and potential benefits of microflow
technology
are
(i)
an
extremely
large
surface-to-volume
ratio,
(ii)
precise
temperature control, (iii) precise residence time
control, (iv) strict laminar flow control, (v)
extremely fast molecular diffusion and (vi)
improvement of reaction process safety. As
introduced
above,
microflow
systems
have
many advantages that can be applied in a wide
301

range of organic synthesis and organic mass
production processes. Electron transfer is one
of the most common driving forces for organic
reactions, and organic electrosynthesis serves
as a straightforward and powerful method of
organic
electron-transfer
processes.
The
integrated use of microflow technology with
organic electrosynthesis is one of the most
sophisticated processes in organic chemistry. In
addition, novel systems that are realized only by
using electrochemical microflow reactors have
been developed.
Yoshida
et
al.
reported
that
a
microflow
electrochemical
system
serves
as
a
quite
effective method for oxidative generation of
unstable organic cations at low temperatures
[76]. This method is called the cation-flow
method. An electrochemical reactor for the
cation-flow method is equipped with a carbon
felt anode and a platinum wire cathode (Figure
6.28). The anodic chamber and the cathodic
chamber are separated by a diaphragm of PTFE
membrane. A solution of a cation precursor is
introduced
to
the
anodic
chamber
and
a
solution
of
trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid
(TfOH) as a proton source is introduced to the
cathodic chamber. The organic cation that is
generated is immediately transferred to a vessel
in which a nucleophilic reaction takes place to
give the desired coupling product.
302

Figure 6.28 Schematic representation of a
microflow electrochemical reactor
Atobe and co-workers reported that the use of
parallel
laminar
flow
in
a
microflow
electrochemical reactor enables the effective
generation of an N-acyliminium ion followed by
trapping
with
an
easily
oxidizable
carbon
nucleophile such as allyltrimethylsilane (Figure
6.29) [77]. A solution of a cation precursor and
a solution of allyltrimethylsilane are introduced
in a parallel manner. The laminar flow prevents
the oxidation of allyltrimethylsilane at the
anode.
Only
the
precursor
is
oxidized
to
generate
the
N-acyliminium
ion.
The
N–acyliminium ion that is generated diffuses
and reacts with allyltrimethylsilane. Although
the efficiency of the process is very low for the
Bu4NBF4/CH3CN
system,
use
of
the
Bu4NBF4/TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) system
(59% yield) or an ionic liquid (62–91% yield)
gave rise to the formation of the desired
product.
303

two-inlet microflow reactor system and (b)
parallel
laminar
flow

the
reactor.
The
illustrated model reaction is anodic substitution
reaction
of
N-(methoxycarbonyl)pyrrolidine
with allyltrimethylsilane
The use of parallel laminar flow in a microflow
electrochemical
reactor
also
enables
chemoselective cathodic reduction to control
product
regioselectivity
in
electrochemical
carbonyl
allylation
[78].
Electrochemical
carbonyl allylation can produce either γ- or
α-adducts depending on whether the aldehyde
or allylic halide is reduced by the cathode. If the
aldehyde has a higher reduction potential, the
allylic halide is predominantly reduced to give
the γ-adduct, but if the reduction potential of
the allylic halide is higher, the aldehyde is
reduced
preferentially
and
the
α-adduct
generation is favoured. Control of product
selectivity
(regioselectivity
in
this
reaction)
therefore requires that either the allylic halides
or
the
aldehydes
should
be
reduced
304

chemoselectively, regardless of their reduction
potentials
(Eq.
6.25).
To
perform
chemoselective cathodic reduction, the authors
employed a liquid–liquid parallel laminar flow
formed
in
an
electrochemical
microflow
reactor. As shown in Figure 6.30, when two
solutions (allylic chloride solution and aldehyde
solution) are introduced through inlets 1 and 2
of the microflow reactor, a stable liquid–liquid
interface is formed and mass transfer between
the input streams occurs only by means of
diffusion. The substrate introduced through
inlet 1 can therefore be predominantly reduced,
whereas the reduction of the inlet 2 substrate
(inflow
2)
can
be
avoided.
Consequently,
chemoselective
cathodic
reduction
proceeds
and an intentional cross-coupling product is
obtained
regioselectively.
In
other
words,
product selectivity control is realized by simply
switching the reagent flows.

6.11 Electrolysis Under
Ultrasonication
The many benefits of ultrasound in chemical
processes
are
well
known
and
have
been
investigated in a variety of chemical fields, but
perhaps
the
most
striking
influence
of
ultrasound concerns heterogeneous reaction
systems, particularly those with a solid–liquid
interface where particle size modification, the
modification
of
particle
dispersion,
the
enhancement of mass transport, the cleaning of
surfaces or the formation of fresh surfaces are
among the beneficial processes [79].
Since an electrochemical synthetic process is a
typical
heterogeneous
one
in
a
solid
(electrode)–liquid
(electrolytic
solution)
interface,
various
effects
of
ultrasound,
particularly
promotion
of
mass
transport,
would be induced by ultrasonication. A major
contribution to mass transport is the micro-jet
stream resulting from the asymmetric collapse
of a cavitation
bubble (Figure
6.31) [80].
Suslick et al. reported that the velocity of the
306

stream reaches in excess of 100 m s−1 in a
water–solid interface [81].
Figure 6.31 Collapse of cavitation bubble. (a)
Symmetrical collapse of a cavitation bubble in
bulk solution. (b) Asymmetrical collapse of a
cavitation bubble in a liquid–solid interface
Such
a
mass
transfer
promotion
by
ultrasonication provides an increase in the
current
efficiency
for
a
variety
of
electrosyntheses. For example, Atobe et al.
reported that a significant ultrasonic effect on
current
efficiency
was
found
in
the
electrochemical
reduction
of
p-methylbenzalaldehyde (Eq. 6.26) [82]. As
shown in Table 6.6, current efficiency for the
reduction
of
p-methylbenzalaldehyde
was
dramatically increased under ultrasonication.
Furthermore,
product
selectivity
for
the
hydrodimeric product (D1) was also increased
by ultrasonication, and the effects could be
rationalized experimentally and theoretically as
307

being
due
to
the
promotion
of
the
mass
transport of the substrate molecule to the
electrode surface from the electrolytic solution
by ultrasonic cavitation [83,84]. The product
selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of
dimethyl maleate (Eq. 6.27) and benzoic acid
(Eq.
6.28)
was
also
greatly
influenced
by
ultrasonication, as shown in Table 6.6.

As
mentioned
in
section
5.8,
conducting
polymers exhibit not only electroconductivity
but also unique optical and chemical properties
[85]. The diversity of properties exhibited by
conducting polymers offers these materials to
be used in numerous technological applications.
Generally, the properties of polymers originate
from their chemical (molecular) and physical
(morphological) structures. It therefore follows
that the structures of conducting polymers
should be able to be controlled in order to tailor
them to the purposes of their utilization. Their
chemical
structures
can
be
controlled
by
changing
the
molecular
structures
of
the
corresponding
monomers
and
by
selecting
conditions and procedures for polymerization
310

[85].
On
the
other
hand,
methods
for
controlling their physical structures have been
relatively limited, but recently many studies
have
focused
on
applying
ultrasound
to
polymerization
processes,
particularly
electropolymerization, for this purpose.
Osawa
et
al.
found
that
the
quality
of
polythiophene films electropolymerized on an
anode can be enhanced by ultrasound. By
conventional methodology the films become
brittle, but by using ultrasound from a 45-kHz
cleaning bath, flexible and tough films (tensile
modulus 3.2 GPa and strength 90 MPa) can be
obtained [86].
The
work
of
Atobe
and
co-workers
was
probably the first ‘modern’ study investigating
electropolymerization under sonication in a
complete series of papers at low frequencies.
Starting from electro-organic reactions under
ultrasonic fields [87], polymerization of aniline
was studied both in electrochemical [88] and
chemical routes [89,90] as well as synthesis of
nanoparticle synthesis [91,92].
The
behaviour
of
polypyrrole
films
electropolymerized under ultrasonication was
also investigated, and unique properties in the
doping–undoping processes were highlighted.
The authors attributed their results to the
elaboration
of
highly
dense
film
under
sonication, but also deplored the degradation of
the film due to high cavitation at 20 kHz
311

(Figure 6.32) [93]. The Besançon group also
studied the use of high-frequency ultrasound
(500 kHz, 25 W) for electropolymerization of
3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene
(EDOT)
or
polypyrrole in aqueous medium in order to
investigate its effects on conducting polymer
properties. They showed that (i) mass transfer
enhancement induced by sonication improves
electropolymerization and (ii) the mass transfer
effect is not the only phenomenon induced by
ultrasound during electrodeposition [94,95].

6.12 Electrosynthesis Using
Specific Electrode Materials
6.12.1 Electrochemical Synthesis Using
Hydrophobic Electrodes
6.12.1.1 Hydrophobic Composite-Plated
Electrodes
Most
electrodes
are
hydrophilic,
but
hydrophobic electrodes can be prepared by
composite-plating electrodes like Ni, Zn, Pb etc.
in
the
corresponding
metal
salt-poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE)
dispersion plating bath. Graphite fluoride and
fluorinated pitch other than PTFE are also used
as hydrophobic composite materials. During
plating, the fine hydrophobic particles are
incorporated
into
the
plated
layer.
The
electrodes
thus
prepared
have
good
electroconductivity
and
their
plated
layer
surface shows water-repellent properties as well
as
mechanical
and
chemical
stability.
In
general, hydrogen and oxygen evolution occur
competitively in electrolytic reactions of organic
compounds
in
an
aqueous
solution.
In
particular, hydrogen evolution readily occurs in
an
acidic
aqueous
solution
while
oxygen
evolution easily takes place in an alkaline
aqueous solution. Accordingly, it is not easy to
cathodically reduce carbonyl compounds in
aqueous acidic solution and anodically oxidize
alcohols in aqueous alkaline solution. High
313

hydrogen-overpotential
cathodes
and
oxygen-overpotential anodes therefore have to
be
used
for
electrochemical
reactions
in
aqueous
acidic
and
alkaline
solutions,
respectively.
However,
nickel/PTFE
composite-plated Ni electrodes are used for the
reduction and oxidation, as mentioned above,
to provide the corresponding alcohols and
carbonyl compounds, respectively, with much
higher current efficiency compared to unplated
Ni electrodes [96,97]. This is not because of the
higher hydrogen- and oxygen-overpotentials of
the
composite-plated
electrode
suppressing
hydrogen and oxygen evolution but because of
the substrate-collecting effect as a result of
strong hydrophobic interaction between the
hydrophobic electrode surface and hydrophobic
organic substrates [96,97].
(6.29)
6.12.1.2 PTFE-Fibre-Coated Electrodes
PTFE-fibre-coated
electrodes,
which
are
prepared by wrapping the electrode in PTFE
strings,
are
hydrophobic.
It
has
been
demonstrated
that
anodic
oxidation
of
hydroquinones at this electrode in the presence
314

of
dienes
in
NaClO4/MeNO2
generated
quinones,
which
underwent
Diels–Alder
reaction with the dienes to provide cyclic
products in excellent yields [98]. Use of an
uncoated glassy carbon anode also generates
quinones
from
hydroquinones,
but
the
coexisting
dienes
are
easily
oxidized
and
decompose prior to reaction with the quinones.
However,
when
a
PTFE-fibre-coated
glassy
carbon electrode is used, the easily oxidizable
diene is maintained on the PTFE-fibres and
only the polar hydroquinones can reach the
electrode through the hydrophobic fibres, as
shown in Figure 6.33. Next, the anodically
generated hydrophobic quinones immediately
react with the dienes adsorbed on the PTFE
fibres, and the resulting hydrophobic products
are also maintained on the fibres to avoid
further oxidation of the products. This novel
method is useful for the synthesis of various
terpenes [99].

generated quinone derivatives with diene on the

6.12.2 Electrolytic Reactions Using
Diamond Electrodes
Diamond is a solid crystal consisting of sp3
carbons
forming
covalent
bonds.
It
has
excellent transparency and thermoconductivity
as well as mechanical and chemical stability.
Although pure diamond is non-conductive, it
becomes electrically conductive by doping with
an
impurity
such
as
boron.
Boron-doped
diamond films can be used as electrodes, which
exhibit excellent and superior electrochemical
properties
compared
to
known
metal
and
carbon
electrode
materials.
Accordingly,
boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes are
promising novel electrode materials [100].
316

6.12.2.1 Electrochemical Features and
Application to Highly Sensitive
Electroanalysis
Wide
Potential
Window
in
Aqueous
Solution [101,102]: BDD electrodes have a
hydrogen overpotential at about −1 V vs. Ag/
AgCl, which is comparable to mercury, and an
oxygen overpotential at about +2.2 V vs. Ag/
AgCl, which is higher than other common
anode
materials.
Its
potential
window
is
therefore as wide as 3.2 V and this is a
pronounced feature of the BDD electrode. Even
in aprotic organic solvents like MeCN, the
cathodic window is about 500 mV wider than
that of a Pt electrode. Accordingly, such unique
properties could result in replacement of either
costly noble metals or toxic heavy metals.
Small
Background
Current
(Small
Residual Current Density) [101,102]: The
capacitance of the BDD electrode surface is a
few mF cm−2, which is two orders smaller
compared to glassy carbon, and its residual
current density is as small as a few hundred nA
cm−2. This is attributable to the fact that
neither dissolved gas nor ions of supporting salt
adsorb on the BDD surface, making redox
reactions difficult.
Large
Overpotential
of
Oxygen
Reduction [103]: Because of the difficult
cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen, the
317

desired reduction current can be observed even
without removal of dissolved oxygen.
Physical
and
Chemical
Stability
and
Excellent
Durability
[100,104]:
BDD
electrodes are basically degradation-free and
can be used even in a corrosive solution.
Electrolysis can be conducted at high current
density (10 A cm−2) and can also be carried out
at temperatures up to 600°C. The electrode
surface is stable and hardly contaminated by
adsorption of impurities.
Fast
Electron-Transfer
Rate
between
Redox
Species
and
BDD
Electrode
[101,104,105]: Outer-sphere one-electron redox
systems
like
Fe(CN)64−/3−,
IrCl62−/3−
and
Ru(NH3)62+/3+ show reversible waves in cyclic
voltammograms and their electron transfer at
the electrode interface is fast.
Unique Electrochemical Selectivity [106]:
Oxygen-terminated BDD electrodes prepared
by treatment with oxygen plasma or anodic
oxidation show selective responses to specific
chemical species.
Since BDD electrodes have a wide potential
window
and
extremely
small
background
current in addition to the above features, highly
sensitive sensors for detection of biological
materials have been developed using BDD
electrodes.
For
example,
when
an
oxygen-terminated BDD electrode is used, a
318

trace amount of dopamine and uric acid can be
detected and quantitatively analyzed even in the
presence of a large amount of ascorbic acid
[106].
Moreover,
since
the
BDD
electrode
surface
is
resistant
to
contamination
with
adsorbed impurities, it can be used as an
electroanalytical detector [107].
Quite
recently
BDD
microelectrodes
were
developed, which enable in vivo pH monitoring
for stomach disorder diagnoses as well as in
vivo assessment of cancerous tumours [108].
6.12.2.2 Application to Organic
Electrosynthesis
Various anodic substitutions like fluorination,
methoxylation, acetoxylation and cyanation of
aromatic compounds, heterocycles and sulfides
have been achieved so far.
Kolbe electrolysis was also investigated using a
BDD
anode
[109].
Quite
recently
it
was
demonstrated that a BDD anode is highly
effective for regioselective homocoupling of
substituted phenols to provide biphenols, as
shown in Eq. 6.30 [110]. BDD electrodes are
also superior anodes for the generation of
alkoxy
radicals
from
alcohols.
Accordingly,
anodic 1,2-dimethoxylation of isoeugenol has
been realized under microflow conditions [111].
Inagi and co-workers have achieved parallel
electrochemical
reactions
of
an
alternating
copolymer
of
9-fluorenol
and
319

9,9-dioctylfluorenone
on
a
BDD
bipolar
electrode
in
Et4NOTs/iPrOH,
giving
a
multi-coloured gradient film [112]. This is an
excellent
application
of
the
wide
potential
window of BDD electrodes.
(6.30)
6.12.2.3 Application to Inorganic
Electrosynthesis
The BDD electrode is a superior anode for the
generation of ozone and hydrogen peroxide
from water compared to platinum and iridium
oxide anodes [113]. Chlorine gas is readily
generated by BDD electrodes and the efficiency
for hypochloric acid formation is high, therefore
applications
in
disinfection
treatments
are
expected. The preparation of persulfuric acid
from sulfuric acid can be performed using BDD
anodes with 70% current efficiency, while the
production of ammonia from nitric acid is
possible
using
BDD
cathodes
[114,115].
Graphite reacts with fluorine gas and graphite
320

fluoride is formed in the bulk of the graphite,
resulting
in
suppression
of
the
Faradaic
current. In sharp contrast, only the surface of
the BDD electrode is fluorinated, therefore it
maintains its electroconductivity [116]. Since it
is stable to hydrogen fluoride, this electrode is
expected to be useful for the preparation of
fluorine gas.
6.13 Photoelectrolysis and
Photocatalysis
6.13.1 Photoelectrolysis
When a semiconductor electrode is irradiated,
charge separation occurs to generate electron
(e)–hole (h+) pairs. The generated electron
works as a reductant, while the hole works as an
oxidant. Honda and Fujishima demonstrated
for
the
first
time
the
possibility
of
such
photosensitized electrolysis using the n-type
semiconductor
TiO2
and
Pt
electrodes,
as
shown in Figure 6.34 [117]. When the surface of
the
TiO2
electrode
is
irradiated
with
a
wavelength shorter than 410 nm, current flows
to
generate
oxygen
and
hydrogen
at
the
surfaces
of
the
TiO2
and
Pt
electrodes,
respectively. TiO2 is excited under irradiation
to generate electron–hole pairs, and the holes
in the valence band move to the surface,
resulting
in
oxidation
of
water,
while
the
electrons in the conduction band move into the
321

bulk
and
then
further
move
through
the
external circuit to the counter Pt electrode to
reduce protons. This suggests that water is
decomposed by visible light into oxygen and
hydrogen,
without
the
application
of
any
external voltage, according to Eq. 6.31. This is
an innovative breakthrough and is referred to
as the Honda–Fujishima effect [117].
(6.31)
Photoelectrochemical cells have the advantage
of producing oxygen and hydrogen in addition
to electrical energy. However, there have been
few
examples
of
applications
of
such
photoelectrolysis to organic reactions to date.
322

Figure 6.34 Photochemical cell with TiO2
electrode
6.13.2 Photocatalysts
When
the
circuit
between
TiO2
and
Pt
electrodes
is
shortened,
Pt
is
eventually
deposited on the surface of TiO2. Accordingly, a
particle of TiO2 with some Pt deposited on it
(Figure 6.35) can be considered as a short
circuit photoelectrochemical cell. In the case of
such a photocatalyst, oxidation and reduction
occur simultaneously at two sites on the small
particle. Since the oxidation and reduction sites
are very close to each other, various unique
organic
synthetic
reactions
have
been
323

developed [118]. For instance, anodic oxidation
of a primary amine generally forms an aldehyde
via an imine intermediate, while the same
oxidation
using
a
TiO2
catalyst
with
Pt
deposited on it affords a secondary amine, as
shown in Figure 6.35 [119]. In this case, the
primary
amine
is
oxidized
with
the
hole
generated
by
photo-excitation
to
form
an
aldehyde, which reacts with the unreacted
starting amine to form an imine intermediate.
The imine is immediately reduced at a Pt site,
resulting in the formation of the secondary
amine. This is due to both oxidation and
reduction occurring at active sites close to each
other. By using this principle, the synthesis of
optically active pipecolinic acid from optically
active lysine was achieved by photocatalytic
reaction using platinized semiconductor TiO2
powder particles, as shown in Eq. 6.32 [120].
Thus,
photocatalytic
reactions
can
be
considered to be wireless electrolytic reactions.

6.14 Electrochemical Polymer
Reactions
As described in Chapter 5, conducting polymers
are redox active, especially in the film state, on
the
electrode
surface.
In
a
number
of
applications, the doping and dedoping process
of conducting polymers needs to be reversible
to avoid over-oxidation and over-reduction,
which may cause undesirable reactions in the
polymer structure. Because of this, a conducting
polymer in its doped state can be regarded as a
reactive
species
capable
of
undergoing
subsequent reactions. The design of specific
electrogenerated
species
generated
from
specific polymers and the subsequent chemical
reactions
represents
a
powerful
means
of
325

introducing
versatile
functionalities
into
polymers.
This
electrochemical
polymer
reaction
is
a
kind
of
post-polymerization
functionalization
(or
simply
post-functionalization) (Figure 6.36) [121]. The
reaction
ratio
(or
the
degree
of
functionalization) of the repeating reaction sites
influences various properties of the resulting
conducting polymer, including its absorption,
photoluminescence and electrochemistry. As
anodic
reactions,
oxidative
halogenations,
cyanations and pyridinations of conducting
polymers are known to proceed when using the
corresponding nucleophilic dopants. Cathodic
reaction such as reductive hydrogenation of the
9-fluorenone moiety in a conducting polymer is
also possible, so that paired electrochemical
polymer reactions in a single cell can be
designed and give good current efficiency.

Electrochemical
polymer
reactions
The
main
advantage
of
electro-organic
synthesis is the ability to rapidly switch the
application of electrical potential to the working
electrode either on or off. By applying this
advantage
to
electrochemical
polymer
326

reactions, the reaction ratio can be finely tuned
by precisely controlling the amount of charge
passed between the anode and cathode of the
electrode. As a result, the physical properties of
the conjugated polymer can be tailored by
adjusting the reaction ratio.
To
progress
this
solid-phase
reaction,
the
choice
of
electrolyte
is
critical.
In
the
electrochemical fluorination of a polyfluorene
derivative, ionic liquid hydrogen fluoride salts
play the roles of supporting salt, reaction
medium and fluorine source, preventing film
detachment during electrolysis (Eq. 6.33) [122].

New Methodology of Organic Electrochemical
Synthesis
344

Shinsuke Inagi and Toshio Fuchigami
The world is facing severe problems such as
environmental
problems,
exhaustion
of
resources
and
energy-relevant
problems.
Organic
electrochemistry,
including
electrosynthesis, has the potential to solve these
problems.
This
chapter
describes
the
contribution
of
organic
electrochemistry
to
organic
electronics,
the
reuse
of
biomass,
C1-chemistry and environmental clean-up.
7.1 Application in Organic
Electronic Devices
Organic molecules and polymers with unique
electronic
properties
have
many
device
applications
in
luminescent
materials,
conductive materials and energy storage. These
organic-based
materials
are
superior
to
inorganic
materials
in
terms
of
lightness,
flexibility and cost. Furthermore, the millions of
molecular designs for organic materials make it
easy to tailor their optoelectronic properties.
The basic principles of organic electronics
devices are described below from the point of
view of organic electrochemistry.
345

7.1.1 Organic Electroluminescence [1,2]
Organic photoluminescent materials generally
emit through the relaxation process of once
photoexcited electrons to their ground state
(Figure 7.1). The excited state can also be
formed
electrochemically.
When
enough
voltage is applied to the anode and cathode
sandwiching the organic emitting layer (thin
film), an injection of holes at the anode and an
injection of electrons at the cathode occur. The
charges migrate inside the layer and recombine
to emit light (Figure 7.2). In order to promote
smooth electron injection from the electrode
surface to the LUMO of the emission layer, an
additional thin layer, i.e. the electron-transport
layer, is introduced between the interfaces. In a
similar manner, the hole-transport layer is used
for hole injection from the electrode to the
HOMO of the emission layer. Although these
transport layers are important for injecting
charge carriers into the emission layer, they
should
not
interrupt
the
emission
of
the
emission layer. Each organic layer is formed by
chemical
vapour
desorption
(CVD)
of
crystalline
molecules
or
a
wet-process
of
polymer solution.
346

Figure 7.1 Mechanism of photoluminescence
Figure 7.2 Mechanism of electroluminescence
7.1.2 Organic Photovoltaic Cells [3,4]
The principle of photoelectric conversion in an
organic photovoltaic cell (OPVC) is the inverse
process of organic electroluminescence (OEL).
347

OPVC generates electric energy through the
charge
separation
state
obtained
by
photo-excitation,
whereas
electric
energy
causes electron injection and hole injection, and
the subsequent charge recombination results in
emission in the OEL process.
To
induce
a
charge
separation
state,
electron-donating and electron-accepting layers
are necessary in the thin film of the OPVC
(Figure 7.3). When the photo-excited state
(exciton) is generated in the donor layer by
solar energy at the near interface of the donor
layer
and
the
acceptor
layer,
the
excited
electron may migrate spontaneously to the
LUMO of the acceptor layer, resulting in the
formation of a charge-separated state. The
charge
carriers
then
migrate
by
hopping
through each layer to the electrode terminals
and this process drives the photovoltaic cell.
Figure
7.3
Photo-electronic
conversion
process
348

The design of the junction of the layers is
important
to
induce
charge
separation
efficiently before deactivation of the exciton.
The construction of a path to the electrode
surface of the generated charge carriers is also
important for high photo-electron conversion
efficiency.
7.1.3 Dye-sensitized Solar Cells [5,6]
Semi-conductor electrode like metal oxide can
generate electric energy based on the principle
of photocatalysts. A photo-excited electron in a
semi-conductor electrode reaches the electric
circuit
and
the
remaining
hole
receives
electrons from a redox system in the electrolyte,
followed by electron transfer from the counter
electrode to the redox system. Because of the
relatively wide band gap of semi-conductor
electrodes, UV light is usually employed to
drive
this
type
of
photovoltaic
cell.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) work in the
visible region of solar light using organic dye on
a
semi-conductor
electrode
as
the
photo-sensitizer. The organic dye should have a
higher LUMO level than the semi-conductor
electrode and a lower HOMO level than the
redox system in the electrolyte. A typical DSSC
system, known as the Grätzel cell, is composed
of a transparent anode, titanium oxide (TiO2)
coated with ruthenium complex, an I−/I3−
redox system in electrolyte and a Pt cathode
(Figure 7.4). The voltage generated in the DSSC
349

corresponds to the difference in energy levels
between
the
Fermi-level
of
TiO2
and
the
standard electrode potential of the I−/I3−redox
system.
Figure 7.4 Structure of Grätzel cell
7.1.4 Organic Transistors [7,8]
Organic transistors, in which organic material
is used for the semi-conductor layer, have been
widely explored. A model of an organic field
effect transistor (OFET) is shown in Figure 7.5.
The mechanism of the OFET is as follows: a
gate voltage induces charge carriers at the
interface of the organic and insulating layers,
resulting in decreasing resistance between the
source electrode and the drain electrode.
350

Figure 7.5 Illustration of top-contact OFET
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other
conjugated
molecules
are
suitable
for
this
purpose.
Intermolecular
carrier
mobility
through the organic layer is an important
factor, therefore orientation control of the
molecules
and
the
design
of
the
junction
between the organic layer and the electrodes
are important. A number of polymer-based
materials (conjugated polymers) for OFET have
been developed. A wet-process is available and
is useful for fabricating large area devices at low
cost, although carrier mobility is generally
lower than for highly oriented small molecules.
7.1.5 Electrochromic Devices [9]
Electrochemical reaction of organic molecules
sometimes accompanies drastic colour change.
Reversible redox behaviour with colour change
is applicable to electrochromic devices. This
colour developing and reducing property, which
is different to luminescence phenomena, is
suitable for electronic paper applications. Once
351

coloured by the electrochemical reaction, the
given image and information remain even after
a power cut.
Figure
7.6
shows
a
typical
electrochromic
device consisting of a sandwiched structure of
electrolyte containing a chromic compound
with anode and cathode plates. To visualize
colour changes, a transparent electrode should
be used for the electrochemical reaction. The
chromic
compounds
used
need
to
have
reversible redox properties, i.e. their radical
anion or radical cation state should be stable.
They may be fixed on a transparent electrode to
avoid colour reducing once a coloured state is
generated at a counter electrode. As described
in section 5.8.6, the use of a stable doping state
and the reversible colour changes of conducting
polymers for electrochromic applications is very
convenient. In addition, film-forming property
of electropolymerized conducting polymers is
advantageous.
Multicoloured
electrochromic
devices are obtained by stacking each cell,
showing their individual colours.

7.1.6 Conducting Polymer-based
Capacitors
Conventional aluminium electrolytic capacitors
are
composed
of
an
aluminium
anode,
aluminium oxide film, electrolytic solution and
an aluminium cathode (Figure 7.7). Aluminium
solid capacitors replace the electrolytic solution
with
solid
conductive
materials
such
as
β-MnO2, organic conductors and conducting
polymers. In contrast to the ionic-conducting
mechanism
of
electrolytic
solutions,
solid
capacitors are driven by an electron-conducting
mechanism, and thus conductivity is greatly
improved. Furthermore, the thermal properties
of solid capacitors are superior to those of
conventional ones.
353

7.2 Electrochemical Conversion
of Biomass to Valuable Materials
Biomass is a renewable organic resource and
therefore it does not cause a depletion problem,
unlike fossil resources such as petroleum and
coal. In the 21st century, the social demands of
the effective utilization of biomass, which can
be transformed to high-performance chemicals
and fuels, have rapidly increased. Chemical
transformation of biomass has to be performed
using energy conservation technology and with
low emissions, and accordingly various trials to
achieve such goals have been carried out using
catalytic
and
enzymatic
reactions.
As
mentioned earlier, electrochemical reactions
have the advantage of both energy conservation
and low emissions. Intensive study of the
electrochemical
processes
applied
to
the
chemical transformation of biomass started
more than 30 years ago, and the transformation
of biomass to high-performance chemicals was
investigated as a national project in the USA
[10].
Today,
the
study
of
biomass
transformation is increasingly important.
The main components of plant-based biomass
are cellulose and lignin, which are polymers.
Since
neither
of
these
are
suitable
for
electrolysis because of their insolubility in
solvents like water, biomass transformation to
354

useful chemicals has been attempted through
either hydrolysis followed by electrolysis or
indirect
electrolysis
with
appropriate
mediators.
Since water-soluble glucose is available by
hydrolysis of cellulose, its transformation to
gluconic acid and sorbitol has been achieved
with
90%
and
50%
current
efficiency,
respectively, by electrochemical oxidation and
reduction of glucose using an undivided cell, as
shown
in
Figure
7.8.
Each
of
these
electrochemical processes has been practiced
separately on a commercial scale.
Figure 7.8 Paired electrosynthesis of gluconic
acid and sorbitol from glucose
Baizer and his co-workers realized the paired
electrosynthesis of gluconic acid and sorbitol
from glucose using both electrode reactions
[11].
Synthesis of dialdehyde starch was achieved by
oxidation of starch with IO3−mediator using
the Ex-cell indirect electrolysis method (100%
current
efficiency).
Other
various
355

electrochemical
transformation
processes
of
biomass have also been developed, for example
paired electrosynthesis of furfuryl alcohol and
2-furancarboxylic acid from furfural derived
from hemicellulose, and electrosynthesis of
acetone, 2-butene and methylethyl ketone from
2,3-butanediol,
which
is
readily
available
through fermentation of glucose and xylose
[12].
Furthermore, anodic oxidative conversion of
lignin to small molecules has been attempted,
and aromatic compounds like vanillin obtained
[13]. Waldvogel and BASF developed a process
for the electrochemical degradation of lignin at
a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode in an
aqueous
solution
to
produce
hydroxybenzaldehyde derivatives like vanillin
and/or phenol derivatives in higher than 5%
yield by weight [14]. Quite recently, oxidation of
lignosulfonic acid at silver or nickel anode in an
aqueous alkaline solution using a flow-type cell
has been investigated in order to increase the
selectivity and yields of useful compounds like
vanillin, vanillic acid and guaiacol (Schmitt and
Waldvogel, unpublished).
Efficient use of biomass should be increasingly
important in the world, and electrolysis is
expected to be a powerful tool to achieve this
beneficial utilization of natural resources.
356

7.3 Application to C1 Chemistry
The concept of C1 chemistry is the synthesis of
various useful organic compounds through the
formation of carbon–carbon bonds using C1
compounds as a starting substrate or by the
introduction of various atoms to C1 compounds.
In the 1980s, related studies were carried out as
a national project, and recently C1 chemistry
has again attracted much attention in relation
to green sustainable chemistry.
A typical example of C1 chemistry, the fixation
of CO2, is a highly important subject. Since CO2
is a final product of the combustion processes,
the reverse conversion and use of CO2 are
highly important research subjects. However,
the reduction potential of CO2 is very negative,
and hence the cathodic evolution of hydrogen
takes place as a competitive reaction, reducing
the current efficiency and product yield. The
cathodic
reduction
has
therefore
been
intensively
studied
using
various
cathode
materials. Among these materials, copper was
found to be most effective for the reduction of
CO2
[15].
In
order
to
increase
efficiency,
cathodic reduction of CO2 was carried out
under high pressure. Cathodic reduction of CO2
provides formic acid, oxalic acid, methane and
so on (Eq. 7.1).
357

(7.1)
Quite recently, Nakata, Einaga and co-workers
achieved the electrochemical reduction of CO2
in seawater using a BDD electrode under
ambient conditions to provide formaldehyde
selectively with high current efficiency (74%), as
shown
in
Eq.
7.2
[16].
The
high
current
efficiency is attributable to the wide potential
window and the sp3-bonded carbon of the BDD.
(7.2)
Cathodic reduction of CO has also been carried
out to form squaric (quadratic) acid, as shown
in Eq. 7.3 [17].
(7.3)
7.4 Environmental Cleanup
Electrochemical
treatment
involving
anodic
decomposition is a highly promising method for
the reduction of toxic pollutants dissolved in
waste water. It is important to select the proper
358

anode materials to optimize this technique
because
the
electrolytic
products
strongly
depend on these materials as well as the
operating
conditions
such
as
the
current
density and temperature [18]. Various materials
have been developed to date as anodes. They
are classified as follows: carbon (amorphous
carbon, graphite), noble metal or metal oxides
(Pt, IrO2, RuO2) and non-noble metal oxides
(PbO2,
SnO2,
TiOx).
Since
early
times,
electrolysis has been used for the treatment of
dye waste water by anodic oxidation of saline to
generate sodium hypochlorite solution, which is
used for decolouration of dye waste water.
Effluent
water
treatment
has
also
been
performed using ozone generated by oxidation
of water with PbO2. In recent years, BDD
electrodes have been developed, and they have
proved to be effective for detoxifying treatment
of waste water containing dye, organic acids,
phenols, soluble polymers and so on [19–21]. It
has also been shown that diamond-like carbon,
is effective for the degradation of persistent
organic fluoro compounds [22]. The efficient
degradation is attributable to hydroxyl radicals
electrogenerated at the BDD anode, resulting in
complete
degradation
to
CO2
[18].
Interestingly, this decomposition mechanism is
quite similar to that with TiO2 photocatalyst.
BDD
electrodes
are
also
effective
in
the
degradation of organic additives in plating
359

baths, and hence a possibility of recycle use of
plating bath is also demonstrated.
It
has
also
been
demonstrated
that
decomposition of harmful organic chlorides like
DDT can be achieved by electrolysis using
cobalt
complex
mediator
like
hydrophobic
vitamin B12 under photo irradiation [23].
Furthermore,
a
novel
flow
and
circulating
system using a Pd tube as a cathode has been
developed for electrocatalytic hydrogenation,
and
this
system
was
shown
to be highly
effective for the dechlorination of polychloro
aromatics, as shown in Figure 7.9 [24,25].
Figure

Conversion
of
chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC)
to
useful substances using gas diffusion electrodes
such as Au, Cu, Pd and In has been attempted,
as shown in Eq. 7.4.

Organic
electrosynthesis
can
be
performed
under
mild
conditions
such
as
room
temperature and normal pressure, and does not
require hazardous oxidants or reductants, such
as heavy metals. Moreover, it produces less
waste compared to ordinary chemical synthesis.
In spite of such advantages, commercialized
organic electrode processes are limited, in
contrast to inorganic industrial processes [1–3].
8.1 Avenue to Industrialization
Organic synthesis usually requires heating. The
starting
materials
and
products
are
easily
decomposed to decrease yields and selectivity at
high reaction temperatures. In contrast, organic
electrosynthesis is a synthetic chemical process
that can be operated under mild conditions
such
as
room
temperature
and
normal
pressure, which avoids heat deterioration of
organic compounds. If optimum electrolytic
conditions
are
established,
organic
electrosynthesis could be a superior synthetic
procedure with excellent yield and selectivity.
In order to decrease activation energy, various
catalysts are commonly employed in chemical
reactions, but many catalysts are expensive
hence recovery and recycling of catalysts is very
important.
366

In
electrolytic
reactions,
electrodes
are
electroconductive interfaces where electrons are
transferred to and from substrates, as well as
acting as the catalyst (electrocatalyst), therefore
a costly catalyst is not necessary. Furthermore,
the
applied
potential
and
current
for
the
electrochemical reaction can be inexpensively
and
precisely
controlled.
Thus,
organic
electrosyntheses
have
many
technical
advantages
over
ordinary
organic
synthetic
processes.
However,
organic
electrosynthesis
also
has
some
disadvantages.
Ordinary
chemical
reactions are homogeneous, while the reaction
field of electrolysis is a heterogeneous interface,
therefore
electrosynthesis
has
a
productive
drawback. Moreover, quite differently from
inorganic
electrode
processes
like
salt
electrolysis,
in
organic
electrosynthesis
the
working electrode providing products is usually
either the anode or the cathode. The counter
electrode is usually not used for the formation
of valuable products except for the paired
synthesis developed by BASF, as explained
below. Although the main role of the counter
electrode is for current flow to the working
electrode, the maintenance of the electrode is
necessary, resulting in an increase in running
cost. When the cathode is a working electrode,
the lifetime of the anode as a counter electrode
becomes
a
barrier
to
industrialization.
In
general, the anode is readily corrosive and
367

therefore expensive electrode materials have to
be used for it. As a result the maintenance cost
of the counter anode is often much higher than
that of the working cathode. These problems
make
industrialization
of
organic
electrosynthesis difficult and, as mentioned
earlier, it must be recognized that organic
electrosynthesis has severe limitations. In spite
of this, cathodic hydrocoupling of acrylonitrile
has
been
used
for
more
than
40
years
worldwide.
This
is
because
the
product,
adiponitrile,
is
profitable
because
of
its
versatility and in high demand because of its
excellent
physical
properties.
The
cathodic
hydrocoupling method is also superior to other
synthetic
procedures
from
an
energy
cost
aspect. Initially, the process was operated using
a divided cell, but later electrolysis without a
diaphragm was developed in order to decrease
the electric power cost of the process.
8.2 Examples
8.2.1 Electrosynthesis of Adiponitrile
6,6-Nylon
is
produced
by
catalytic
hydrogenation
of
adiponitrile
to
form
hexamethylenediamine,
followed
by
dehydration-condensation with adipic acid, as
shown in Eq. 8.1. Since 6,6-nylon has excellent
strength and durability, it is widely used in tyre
cord, synthetic clothes, engineering plastics etc.
Hexamethylenediisocyanate
as
a
starting
368

material for polyurethane is also produced from
hexamethylenediamine. Because of the benefits
of
nylon
and
polyurethane,
cathodic
hydrocoupling of acrylonitrile is an essential
technology for daily life.
(8.1)
Cathodic hydrocoupling of acrylonitrile has
been known since the 1940s, but the yield of
adiponitrile was not high initially. In 1960,
Baizer at Monsanto improved both the yield
and current efficiency of the hydrocoupling by
using
quaternary
ammonium
salts
as
the
supporting electrolyte [2]. In 1963 and 1965,
Monsanto
developed
and
commercialized,
respectively, the electrohydrodimerization of
acrylonitrile, which was produced at low cost on
a
large
scale
using
the
SOHIO
method
established at that time (Eq. 8.2). An aqueous
solution
containing
a
large
amount
of
quaternary ammonium salts (about 40%) was
used to dissolve hardly-soluble acrylonitrile at
high
concentration.
Thus,
the
Monsanto
process adopted a homogeneous electrolytic
system.
369

(8.2)
On
the
other
hand,
the
Asahi
Chemical
Company (now the Asahi Kasei Corporation) in
Japan
developed
emulsion
cathodic
hydrocoupling
of
acrylonitrile
using
the
thermomorphicity of acrylonitrile and water
containing 10% quaternary ammonium salt,
and started operation of the process in 1971 [4].
Both processes were operated in a divided cell
equipped with a separator-like cation exchange
membrane at the early stage of the processes.
Later
on,
both
companies
improved
their
processes,
and
in
the
mid-1980s
they
established processes with undivided cells in
order to reduce the higher cell voltage caused
by
separator
resistance.
To
develop
the
undivided cell process, they focused on (i) high
selectivity
as
well
as
less
corrosion,
(ii)
establishment of electrolytic conditions with
stable long-term operation and systems for
recovery
of
quaternary
ammonium
salt/
purification of products, and (iii) development
of a facility in which the explosive gas mixture
of acrylonitrile and oxygen can be treated
safely.
The cathodes used in this process are Hg, Pb or
Cd, which have higher hydrogen overpotential
because hydrogen generation as a side reaction
370

decreases
the
current
efficiency
for
the
hydrocoupling. On the other hand, Fe, Ni or Pb
is used for the anode, and these have lower
oxygen overpotentials to prevent the anodic
oxidation
of
organic
compounds.
The
supporting
electrolyte
is
a
mixture
of
quaternary ammonium salts and inorganic salt.
Quaternary
ammonium
salts
such
as
ethyltributylammonium salt are effective not
only for increasing the selectivity of adiponitrile
formation but also for protection of the cathode
from
corrosion.
Inorganic
salts
such
as
potassium phosphate and alkali metal borate
increase the conductivity of the electrolyte and
prevent corrosion of the anode.
The
detailed
operation
conditions
and
performances of this coupling process have
been reported by several workers [1–4] and an
example of operation conditions is as follows:
Cathode: Pb
Anode: Fe (Ni 9%)
Supporting electrolyte: (EtBu3N)2HPO4 +
K2HPO4 + K2B4O7
Current density: 2 kA m−2
Temperature: 55 °C
Current efficiency: 90.7%
At the present time more than 300,000 tonnes
per year of adiponitrile is manufactured by
cathodic
hydrocoupling
of
acrylonitrile
371

worldwide, and in 2010 24% of this adiponitrile
was manufactured by cathodic hydrocoupling
by whole production.
8.2.2 Electrosynthesis of Aromatic
Aldehydes
The electrochemical production of acetals of
aromatic
aldehydes
like
anisaldehyde
and
p-tolualdehyde has been running for more than
30 years at BASF, as shown in Eq. 8.3 [2].
Oxidation of the methyl group on aromatic
rings provides aromatic aldehydes, but ordinary
chemical methods using oxidants often cause
overoxidation, resulting in the formation of
carboxylic
acids
as
a
by-product.
The
electrochemical oxidation of toluene derivatives
in
methanol
provides
anodically
stable
dimethylacetals, which are readily hydrolyzed
to form aldehydes and methanol. The recovered
methanol
can
be
recycled
for
anodic
acetalization. This process is operated in the
capillary gap cell developed by BASF, as shown
in Figure 6.26 [5].
(8.3)
372

8.2.3 Paired Electrosynthesis of
Phthalide and t-Butylbenzaldehyde
Recently,
BASF
commercialized
the
paired
electrosynthesis
of
phthalide
and
t-butylbenzaldehyde dimethylacetal, as shown
in Eq. 8.4 [2]. The products are useful as plant
protectors,
additives
for
plating
baths,
ultraviolet
absorbers,
aroma
chemicals,
fungicides and so on. Phthalide has been
prepared by classical catalytic hydrogenation of
phthalic
acid
anhydride,
but
this
method
requires pure hydrogen gas and high pressure.
On
the
other
hand,
during
anodic
dimethoxylation of t-butyltoluene, protons are
predominantly
reduced
at
the
cathode
to
generate hydrogen gas. BASF made great efforts
to find a compatible reduction process that can
be used instead of proton reduction. Eventually,
the combination of anodic dimethoxylation of
t-butyltoluene
and
cathodic
reduction
of
phthalic acid diester was found to establish the
paired electrosynthesis, as shown in Eq. 8.4.
Cathodic
reduction
of
phthalic
acid
dimethylester
produces
phthalide
and
methanol, while the resulting methanol is used
for anodic dimethoxylation of t-butyltoluene to
provide dimethylacetal in good yield. In this
paired
electrosynthesis,
the
balance
of
methanol, proton and electron is remarkable.
373

(8.4)
This process runs in an undivided capillary cell
with
a
stack
of
bipolar
round
graphite
electrodes (Figure 6.26) [5]. The electrodes
have a centre hole, and are separated by spacers
and
connected
in
series.
Since
quaternary
ammonium salt is used as the supporting
electrolyte, cathodic reduction of methanol is
suppressed and reduction of o-phthalic acid
dimethyl
ester
proceeds
highly
efficiently
without
formation
of
by-product.
Since
efficiency at both electrode reactions is high,
the energy efficiency of the paired synthesis is
much
better
than
that
of
conventional
processes.
374

8.2.4 Electrochemical Perfluorination
Electrochemical perfluorination is a process in
which all the hydrogen atoms in a starting
organic molecule are substituted with fluorine
atoms without elementary fluorine generation
during electrolysis. J.H. Simons at 3M achieved
the electrochemical perfluorination of organic
compounds
in
anhydrous
liquid
HF
using
nickel
electrodes
to
provide
perfluorinated
products for the first time in 1941 [6,7]. He is a
pioneer of electrochemical perfluorination and
this method is called Simons' process. The
process
uses
an
undivided
cell
at
low
temperature to keep HF as a liquid (the boiling
point
of
HF
is
19.5
°C).
Electrochemical
perfluorination
of
organic
compounds
containing oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms
forms salts with anhydrous HF, which provide
good conductivity for the anhydrous liquid HF
solution. On the other hand, in the case of
hydrocarbon, salts such as KF and NaF must be
added to impart conductivity and allow the
electrochemical perfluorination process. From
carboxylic acids (its chlorides), sulfonic acids
(its
chlorides)
and
trialkylamines,
the
perfluorinated products are obtained in good
yields, as shown in Eqs. 8.5–8.7 [8]. However,
in many cases the yield for electrochemical
perfluorination
is
rather
low
because
of
carbon–carbon
bond
cleavage
during
electrolysis [8]. The products, perfluoroalkyl
375

carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, are useful as
detergents and lubricants.
(8.5)
(8.6)
(8.7)
The reaction mechanism has been discussed for
many years [8–11]. One mechanism involves
anodically generated fluorine radical as the vital
reagent
for
perfluorination
and
another
involves electrogenerated highly oxidized nickel
fluorides such as Ni2F5, NiF3 and NiF4 on a
nickel anode surface. These act as fluorinating
reagents and are electrochemically regenerated
at the nickel anode. During the electrolysis,
partially fluorinated products have polarity and
they stay in the electrolyte to be subjected to
further electrolysis.
The final perfluorinated products are non-polar
and their specific density is very high, therefore
they precipitate from liquid HF onto the cell
bottom as a liquid.
The
electrochemical
perfluorination
process
now runs on a large scale at 3M in the USA and
at
the
Central
Glass
Company
and
the
Mitsubishi
Materials
Electronic
Chemicals
376

Company in Japan. Mitsui Chemicals in Japan
also
produces
NF3
by
electrochemical
perfluorination of NH3 [12]. NF3 is used as an
etchant and cleaning gas for apparatus used in
the
chemical
vapour
deposition
(CVD)
technique.
8.2.5 Other Examples
8.2.5.1 3,6-Dichloropicolic Acid
The
Daw
Chemical
Company
have
commercialized the electrochemical reduction
of 3,4,5,6-tetrachloropicolic acid in aqueous
solution to 3,4-dichloropicolic acid, which is
useful as a precursor to agrochemicals (Eq. 8.8)
[13]. As explained in Chapter 4 (Fig. 4.5), the
high
regioselectivity
is
attributed
to
the
controlled orientation of the substrate at the
cathode surface owing to the dipole moment of
the molecule.
(8.8)
8.2.5.2 β-Lactam Derivative
The
Otsuka
Chemical
Company
have
commercialized
the
electrosynthesis
of
the
antibiotic
substance
β-lactam
derivative
(GCLE), as shown in Eq. 8.9. The electrolysis is
377

operated
in
a
two-phase
system
of
dichloromethane and water, and the reaction
proceeds through anodic oxidation of chloride
ions.
(8.9)
8.2.5.3 Cysteine
Electrochemical reduction of cystin to cysteine
is used in many countries, including the USA,
Japan, China and some European countries
(Eq. 8.10). Since separation of cysteine from
cystin is quite difficult, the electrolysis has to be
continued until all the starting cysteine has
been completely consumed. This means that at
the final stage of the electrolysis electricity is
consumed mainly for the reduction of protons
to evolve hydrogen gas, resulting in a decrease
in current efficiency, which is a problem that
has still to be overcome.
(8.10)
8.2.5.4 Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide
Electrochemical
dialysis
of
tetramethylammonium chloride uses a cationic
ion
exchange
membrane
to
produce
378

chlorine-free
and
highly
pure
tetramethylammonium hydroxide in Japan (Eq.
8.11).
In
order
to
avoid
contamination
of
chlorine in the product, anodically generated
chlorine gas is removed completely from the
dialysis system.
(8.11)
8.2.5.5 Other Examples
BASF
manufactures
2,5-dimethoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran
and
dihydrophthalic acid from furan and o-phthalic
acid, respectively (Eq. 8.12). They also produce
acetoin by anodic oxidation of cyclohexanone
with an iodine mediator.
(8.12)
Furthermore,
SNPF
in
France
produces
anti-inflammatory phenoprofen by the cathodic
reduction
of
m-(α-chloroethyl)phenyl
phenylether in the presence of carbon dioxide
(Eq. 8.13) [14].
379

(8.13)
Electrosynthesis
of
the
artificial
sweetener
maltol and m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol used to be
commercialized in Japan, but this process had
to be stopped because of its high cost compared
to alternative chemical processes and the lower
price of products made in other countries.
As explained above, organic electrochemical
processes often compete with chemical ones
therefore the development of electrochemical
processes that are superior to chemical ones is
necessary. It should be emphasized that organic
electrosynthetic processes that address the need
for low emissions are highly promising [2].

Examples of Commercialized Organic Electrode
Processes
383

A.1 Electrochemical Fluorination
Anodic fluorination and anodic methoxylation
of ethyl phenylthioacetate [1,2]
Anodic
partial
fluorination
of
organic
compounds
usually
uses
a
poly(hydrogen
fluoride) complex of amine or ammonium salt
as
the
fluorine
source
and
supporting
electrolyte. In an undivided cell, hydrogen
evolution by cathodic reduction of proton takes
place as well as the desired anodic fluorination
of a substrate. In an acetonitrile solution,
fluorination
proceeds
via
an
anodically
generated
cation
intermediate,
whereas
methoxylation occurs selectively in a methanol
solution
(Eq.
A.1).
Optimal
conditions
for
anodic fluorination depend on the substrates
used.
It
is
necessary
to
optimize
the
combination of reaction media and supporting
electrolytes.
Anodic fluorination of ethyl phenylthioacetate
proceeds via oxidation of the sulfur atom
followed by deprotonation of its α-position. The
deprotonation step is promoted by the effect of
an electron-withdrawing group substituted at
the α-carbon to the phenylthio group. The
monofluorinated product at the α-position of
the ester group has to be relatively stable if it is
to be used as a building block for further
transformation.
384

(A.1)
Figure A.1 shows a typical electrolytic cell for
anodic fluorination, equipped with a platinum
plate anode and cathode (2 cm × 2 cm). The cell
is filled with an electrolytic solution containing
ethyl phenylthioacetate (196 mg, 1 mmol),
Et3N-3HF (1.6 ml, 10 mmol) and acetonitrile
(8.4 ml). Constant current electrolysis (20 mA,
current density 5 mA cm−2) for 2 h 41 min (2 F
mol−1) is conducted with stirring. The solution
is then neutralized by saturated NaHCO3 and
extracted with ethyl acetate (30 ml × 3). The
organic phase is washed with brine (100 ml)
and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent is removed
under reduced pressure and the crude product
is purified by silica gel column chromatography
to give the desired fluorinated product in
50–70% yield. If methanol is used instead of
acetonitrile,
the
methoxylated
product
is
obtained selectively.
385

fluorination by the constant current method
A.2 Electrosynthesis Using a
Hydrophobic Electrode
Synthesis
of
chromane
from
terpene
and
electrogenerated quinomethane [3]
A hetero Diels–Alder reaction of quinomethane
and terpene is regarded as a biogenetic pathway
for
euglobal
derivatives.
Electrochemical
generation of quinomethane and subsequent
cycloaddition with terpene is possible to obtain
chromane, a basic structure of euglobal (Figure
A.2).
386

Figure A.2 Illustration of electrolytic set up
with a hydrophobic electrode and euglobal
synthesis
Sulfide 1 (0.1 mmol) and α-phellandrene 2 (0.4
mmol) are dissolved in 1.0 M LiClO4/CH3NO2
(15 ml). Constant potential electrolysis (1.2 V
vs. Ag/AgCl) is performed using a glassy carbon
anode covered with poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) and a platinum plate cathode. After the
passage of 1.2 F mol−1 of charge, the product is
extracted with hexane (10 ml) several times.
The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 and
product 3 is confirmed by TLC.
A.3 Natural Product Synthesis
Using Anodic Oxidation
Synthesis
of
Aniba
neolignan
by
anodic
oxidation of phenol derivatives [4]
387

Although anodic oxidation of phenol derivatives
is very useful for obtaining alicyclic compounds
from aromatic compounds, its versatile reaction
paths make it difficult to produce the desired
product selectively. If reaction conditions are
optimized, anodic oxidation of phenols can be a
powerful
tool
for
obtaining
the
desired
products, which are difficult to prepare by
conventional organic synthesis.
According to Eq. A.2, cation A, which is
generated by anodic oxidation of phenol 1,
undergoes cycloaddition with isosafrole to give
a natural product, Aniba neolignan.
(A.2)
Phenol 1 (100 mg), isosafrole 2 (500 mg) and
LiClO4 (200 mg) are dissolved in methanol/
acetic acid (2:1, 30 ml) and used as the
electrolytic solution. In a glassy carbon beaker
as anode, constant current electrolysis (10 mA,
current density 0.19 mA cm−2) is carried out for
130 min using a platinum wire cathode. The
388

solvent is removed and the product is purified
by silica gel column chromatography.
A.4 Kolbe Electrolysis
Diester synthesis from monoester of adipic
acid [5]
The Kolbe reaction, which involves one-electron
oxidation
of
carboxylate
and
subsequent
decarboxylation to form its dimer, is very
effective
in
producing
higher
alkanes.
For
example, the monoester of adipic acid can be
converted to its dimeric compound (Eq. A.3).
(A.3)
An electrolytic cell equipped with a platinum
anode and a cathode (25 mm × 30 mm,
distance 5 mm) is filled with a methanol
solution
(250
ml)
containing
adipic
acid
monomethyl ester (120 g, 0.75 mol), sodium
methoxide (4.1 g, 0.075 mol) and pyridine (10
ml, 0.12 mol). Constant current electrolysis (1.1
A, current density 0.13 mA cm−2) is performed
for
23
h.
During
electrolysis
under
these
conditions heat generates to induce reflux of the
reaction
mixture.
After
cooling
to
room
temperature, acetic acid (20 ml) is added to the
mixture to acidify it. The solvent is removed
under reduced pressure and the residual solid is
389

dissolved in ether (500 ml). The filtrate is
washed with aqueous NaHCO3 and water, and
dried over CaSO4. The product is obtained by
distillation under reduced pressure.
A.5 Indirect Electrosynthesis
Using a Mediator
Ketone synthesis by indirect anodic oxidation
of alcohol using iodine mediator [6]
The cation species of iodine is generated by
anodic oxidation of iodide ions and is used for
the oxidation of alcohol to give a ketone product
and recovery of iodide ions. The reaction can be
mediated
by a catalytic
amount
of iodide
without metal oxide (Eq. A.4).
In an electrolytic cell, an aqueous solution (15
ml) of potassium iodide (2.49 g, 0.015 mol) and
alcohol
(0.06
mol)
is
produced.
Constant
current electrolysis using platinum or carbon
anode
is
conducted
for
4–15
F
mol−1
of
electricity. The organic layer is separated and
the water layer is extracted with diethyl ether.
The combined organic phase is washed with
aqueous Na2S2O3. The product is purified by
distillation.
390

(A.4)
A.6 Electrosynthesis of
Conducting Polymers
Electropolymerization of pyrrole
Electropolymerization of aromatic compounds
proceeds at the electrode surface and a thin film
is obtained. These conducting polymers are
used for conductive materials, electrochromic
devices and catalysts. A typical mechanism of
oxidative polymerization of pyrrole is shown in
Eq. A.5.
(A.5)
In a beaker-type cell, platinum plate electrodes
(1 cm × 1 cm) and a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) as a reference are set up. An aqueous
391

solution (50 ml) of pyrrole (0.1 M) and NaClO4
(0.1 M) is added to the cell. A potential sweep
from −0.6 V vs. SCE to +0.8 V vs. SCE at a scan
rate of 100 mV s−1 involves polymerization on
the working electrode, which is monitored as
shown in Figure A.3. The working electrode
covered with polypyrrole is purified by washing
with water.
