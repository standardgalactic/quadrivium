The  rapid  advancement  of  artiﬁcial   intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning  (ML)  
technologies  has  had  a  signiﬁcant   impact  on  cloud  security,  as  it  has  in  many  
other  sectors.  This  abstract  examines  how  AI  and  ML  are  aﬀecting   cloud  security,  
highlighting  their  major  contributions,  diﬃculties,   and  potential.  Traditional  
approaches  to  cloud  security  provide  improved  threat  detection,  real-time  monitoring,  
and  adaptive  defense  mechanisms.  These  technologies  are  adept  at  processing  
enormous  volumes  of  data,  allowing  them  to  spot  trends,  anomalies,  and  potential  
dangers  that  more  traditional  security  measures  would  miss.  In  order  to  quickly  
identify  and  take  appropriate  action  in  response  to  unauthorised  access,  data  
breaches,  and  other  malicious  activities,  AI-driven  systems  can  quickly  analyse  
user  behaviour,  network  behaviour,  and  system  logs.  It  introduces  complexity  in  
the  form  of  adversarial  assaults,  model  interpretability,  and  data  privacy  issues.  For  
users  to  trust  AI-driven  security  systems  and  to  comprehend  their  decision-making  
processes,  openness  of  these  systems  is  essential.

Data  refers  to  raw  facts  and  ﬁgures.   After  processing  data,  the  information  is  created.  
Information  like  facts  or  statistics  that  can  be  recorded,  stored,  and  analysed  can  be  
in  various  forms  such  as  text,  numbers,  images,  audio,  or  video.  The  amount  of  data  
generated  every  day  in  the  data-driven  world  of  today  makes  it  nearly  diﬃcult   to  
keep  it  all  locally.  Cloud  services  are  being  used  by  so  many  people  and  businesses  
to  store  these  massive  and  hefty  volumes  of  data  on  cloud  servers.  Additionally,  as  
the  need  for  cloud  computing  grows,  so  does  the  need  for  data  recovery  methods  and  
services.  The  ability  to  recover  data  and  information  from  the  backup  server  when  
the  primary  server  is  down  is  the  primary  goal  of  recovery  services  and  technologies.  
A  secondary  server  to  hold  backups  for  the  primary  cloud  server  will  be  more  

﻿
expensive  to  add  than  the  primary  server  itself,  which  is  already  quite  expensive  
and  time-consuming  to  build.  The  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to  provide  realistic,  cost-
eﬀective   solutions  to  this  urgent  problem.

Cloud  computing  has  revolutionized  the  way  organizations  store,  process,  and  manage  
data,  oﬀering   ﬂexibility   and  scalability.  However,  the  rise  in  cyber  threats  poses  
signiﬁcant   challenges  to  maintaining  robust  cloud  security.  This  chapter  delves  into  
the  pivotal  role  that  Artiﬁcial   Intelligence  (AI)  and  Machine  Learning  (ML)  play  in  
enhancing  cloud  security.  By  harnessing  the  capabilities  of  AI  and  ML,  organizations  
can  proactively  detect,  mitigate,  and  respond  to  evolving  cyber  threats,  ultimately  
fortifying  their  cloud  infrastructure.AI-driven  techniques  empower  security  systems  
to  recognize  patterns,  anomalies,  and  potential  threats  within  vast  datasets.  ML  
algorithms  can  learn  from  historical  attack  data,  enabling  the  prediction  of  future  
threats  and  the  development  of  more  eﬀective   defense  mechanisms.  Moreover,  AI-
enhanced  authentication  and  access  control  mechanisms  bolster  identity  management,  
reducing  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  and  data  breaches.

Cybersecurity  is  the  knowledge  and  practice  of  defending  computers,  mobile  
devices,  servers,  electronic  devices,  networks,  and  precious  data  from  malicious  
attacks.  Traditional  security  methods  have  advantages  in  various  ways,  but  they  
may  sometimes  seem  to  be  ineﬀective   due  to  lack  of  intelligence  and  vitality  to  
meet  the  current  diverse  needs  of  the  network  industry  thus  latest  techniques  need  
to  be  developed  to  handle  these  threats.  The  developments  in  Artiﬁcial   intelligent  
(AI)  techniques  have  simpliﬁed   life  by  providing  eﬃcient   solutions  in  diﬀerent   
domains  including  cyber  security.  This  chapter  has  reviewed  existing  tools  of  
cyber  security,  highlighting  diﬀerent   ways  artiﬁcial   intelligence  can  be  applied  in  
providing  Cybersecurity  solutions.  AI-based  security  systems  make  decisions  for  
helping  people,  it  is  particularly  worrying  that  these  systems  do  not  currently  have  
any  moral  code  thus  current  chapter  also  highlights  the  need  to  ethical  code  in  
providing  AI  solution  for  cyber  security.

Recently  data  sharing  through  the  cloud  is  widely  used  and  becoming  a  trend.  But  
protecting  data  conﬁdentiality   and  integrity  is  essential.  Data  conﬁdentiality   and  
integrity  are  maintained  using  cryptography.  However,  since  it  cannot  ensure  that  
the  data  hasn’t  been  altered,  there  is  still  a  trust  issue.  The  proxy  re-encryption  
(PRE)  technique  was  presented  as  a  solution  to  this.  It  includes  encrypting  the  data  
twice,  allowing  one  to  determine  whether  or  not  it  has  been  altered.  The  PRE  system  
is  also  prone  to  attacks  that  forge  re-encryption  keys.  Here  the  data  is  encrypted  
twice  so  that  the  data  can  be  checked  whether  it  is  modiﬁed   or  not.  But  the  PRE  
system  is  prone  to  the  abuse  of  re-encryption  keys.  Therefore,  accountable  proxy  
re-encryption  (APRE)  is  proposed.  Here,  if  the  data  is  altered  by  proxy,  the  system  
will  detect  whether  proxy  is  malicious  or  the  delegator  is  trying  to  frame  proxy  as  
malicious.  Also,  the  authors  extend  the  algorithm  and  implemented  base64  encoding  
and  decoding.  This  prevents  many  passive  cyber  attacks.

Cloud  computing  has  profoundly  changed  the  face  of  data  management  for  enterprises,  
providing  increased  scalability,  ease  of  access,  and  cost  savings.  Nonetheless,  this  
change  has  highlighted  the  crucial  need  for  strengthened  security  measures  to  protect  
sensitive  data  from  the  ever-changing  spectrum  of  cyber  threats.  Following  the  
cloud’s  rise  as  a  storehouse  for  large  datasets,  the  quest  for  sophisticated  security  
solutions  has  gained  traction.  This  motivation  has  resulted  in  the  incorporation  of  
artiﬁcial   intelligence  (AI)  into  the  cloud  security  architecture.  As  cloud  storage  
becomes  increasingly  popular,  organizations  are  becoming  more  concerned  about  
data  security.  Sensitive  data  is  transmitted,  ranging  from  messages  and  images  to  
ﬁnancial   and  health  information.  As  technology  advances,  there  is  a  growing  threat  
to  customer  data  in  the  cloud,  making  greater  cloud  security  more  important  than  
ever.  This  study  aims  to  give  a  comprehensive  insight  into  the  role  of  AI  in  data  
storage  and  transmission  security  in  the  cloud.

﻿
With  a  majority  of  the  human  population  on  the  internet,  online  activity  has  become  
the  order  of  the  day.  And  that  is  why  the  internet  is  where  criminals  of  every  hue  
and  color  join  forces  and  innovate  in  innovative  ways.  Not  all  “lands”  have  laws  
to  deal  with  cybersecurity  and  privacy.  Criminals  across  the  globe  have  exploited  
the  gap  between  technology  and  laws.  The  Indian  Constitution  recognizes  privacy  
as  a  fundamental  right,  albeit  with  certain  restrictions.  Governments,  in  the  name  
of  providing  secure  cyberspace,  infringe  upon  the  privacy  rights  of  citizens.  And  
surveillance  in  India  is  chieﬂy   governed  by  the  Indian  Telegraph  Act  u/s  5,  which  
permits  the  government  and  its  agencies  to  surveil  provided  a  qualifying  prerequisite  
preexists.  Various  surveillance  apparatuses  have  been  established  by  the  GoI.  
Allegedly,  the  surveillance  regime  poses  a  grave  threat  and  a  chilling  eﬀect   on  
privacy  and  freedom  of  expression  rights  as  enshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution.  
This  chapter  discusses  cybersecurity,  privacy,  and  surveillance  regimes  in  Indian  
cyberspace.

Cloud  computing  has  emerged  as  a  powerful  paradigm  for  delivering  web  services,  
and  includes  scalability,  ﬂexibility,   and  cost  eﬃciency.   Due  to  functional  overlap  
and  diversity,  web  services  form  a  major  challenge  for  selecting  adequate  services  
to  develop  user-provider  trust.  To  address  the  issue,  this  study  presented  a  machine  
learning  based  trusted  model  to  assist  users  in  selecting  trustworthy  web  services.  In  
the  initial  stage,  using  K-Means  clustering  method  the  services  are  selected  based  on  
three  clusters  such  as  high,  medium,  and  low  trust.  Next,  the  trust  score  is  generated  
by  evaluating  performance  parameters  to  identify  the  best  services.  Experiments  
conducted  with  QWS  datasets  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  approach  eﬃciently   
predicts  adequate  services  with  a  minimum  error  rate  and  high  accuracy  gain.  This  
technique  achieves  a  99.32%,  99.36%  and  99.48%  accuracy  rates  for  the  low,  medium,  
and  high  trust  prediction,  respectively.  The  result  shows  that  it  is  more  eﬀective   than  
existing  approaches  and  builds  a  strong  trust  relation  between  users  and  providers.

environment, while also enforcing security policies and compliance requirements 
to ensure appropriate access to resources, data, and services(Agrawal et al., 2024; 
Satav et al., 2024). The Information and Analytics Management (IAM) in cloud 
environments are explained below:
•	
User Identity Management: This involves creating, managing, and deleting 
user accounts. It includes assigning unique identifiers (usernames or email 
addresses) and maintaining user profiles. Often, IAM systems integrate with 
external directories such as Active Directory or LDAP for user management.
•	
Authentication: Ensuring that users and systems are who they claim to be 
is a core IAM function. This typically involves using various authentication 

12
Securing Cloud Infrastructure in IaaS and PaaS Environments
methods, including passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and 
biometrics.
•	
Authorization: Once authenticated, IAM systems control what resources and 
services users or systems can access. This is where access control policies, 
permissions, and roles come into play.
•	
Access Control: IAM tools provide mechanisms to grant or deny access to 
resources and services. This includes fine-grained control over permissions, 
specifying who can read, write, update, or delete data, and under what 
conditions.
•	
Audit and Compliance: IAM systems often maintain logs and records of 
access and authentication activities. These logs are essential for security 
audits, compliance reporting, and investigating security incidents.
•	
Single Sign-On (SSO): IAM can implement SSO solutions that enable users 
to access multiple services and applications with a single set of credentials, 
enhancing user convenience and security.
5.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used method in Information Access 
Management (IAM) systems to control access permissions. It assigns users or entities 
roles based on their job functions or responsibilities, defining their actions within 
the system(Rahamathunnisa, Sudhakar, et al., 2023; Srinivas et al., 2023).
•	
Roles: Roles are defined based on job functions or responsibilities, and each 
role is associated with a set of permissions. For example, an organization 
might have roles like “System Administrator,” “Developer,” or “Marketing 
Manager.”
•	
Permissions: Permissions are specific actions or operations that a user 
or entity can perform. These may include reading, writing, deleting, or 
configuring resources and data.
•	
Role Assignment: Users or entities are assigned to roles based on their job 
requirements. For example, a system administrator would be assigned the 
“System Administrator” role, which grants permissions to manage system-
level resources.
•	
Least Privilege: RBAC adheres to the principle of “least privilege,” meaning 
that users or entities are given the minimum access necessary to perform 
their job tasks. This minimizes the potential for unauthorized or unintended 
actions.

13
Securing Cloud Infrastructure in IaaS and PaaS Environments
•	
Scalability: RBAC is scalable and flexible. As organizational roles evolve 
or new roles are introduced, IAM administrators can adjust role assignments 
and permissions accordingly.
•	
Access Revocation: When a user’s role or job function changes, IAM 
administrators can easily modify their role assignments to ensure access 
privileges align with their new responsibilities.
RBAC streamlines access control in complex environments, enhancing security 
by minimizing over-privileged accounts, and is a crucial part of IAM in cloud 
environments, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and security.
5.3 Implementing Strong Authentication
Strong authentication is crucial for enhancing security in cloud and other computing 
environments, providing an extra layer of security beyond traditional passwords, 
making it harder for unauthorized individuals or entities to access sensitive systems 
and data(Dhanya et al., 2023; Pramila et al., 2023; Ramudu et al., 2023).
•	
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA is a fundamental component 
of strong authentication. It requires users to provide two or more factors for 
verification. Factors include something you know (e.g., a password or PIN), 
something you have (e.g., a smartphone or smart card), and something you 
are (e.g., biometric data like fingerprints or retina scans). Implement MFA for 
all user accounts in your cloud environment, requiring at least two different 
factors for authentication.
•	
Use Strong Password Policies: Encourage users to create strong and unique 
passwords. Strong passwords should be lengthy, include a combination of 
upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, and should 
not be easily guessable. Enforce regular password changes and educate users 
about password security best practices.
•	
Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO solutions can enhance security by allowing 
users to authenticate once and then access multiple services or applications 
with a single set of credentials. Implement an SSO system that supports MFA 
for even stronger authentication.
•	
Biometric Authentication: Where possible, leverage biometric authentication 
methods like fingerprint or facial recognition. Biometrics provide a high level 
of security and user convenience.
•	
Certificate-Based Authentication: Certificate-based authentication involves 
issuing digital certificates to users or devices. Users and devices must present 

14
Securing Cloud Infrastructure in IaaS and PaaS Environments
a valid certificate to access resources. This method is highly secure and is 
often used for machine-to-machine communication.
•	
Hardware Tokens and Smart Cards: Implement hardware tokens or smart 
cards as one of the authentication factors. Users must possess the physical 
token or card to gain access.
•	
Contextual Authentication: Implement contextual authentication, where 
the authentication process takes into account the user’s context, such as their 
location, device, and behavior patterns. If the context appears suspicious, 
additional authentication factors can be required.
•	
Session Management: Implement session management controls to ensure 
that authenticated sessions are not hijacked. Implement session timeouts and 
provide the ability for users to log out.
•	
Secure Communication: Ensure that all authentication processes and the 
exchange of authentication data occur over secure channels using encryption.
•	
Regular Auditing and Monitoring: Regularly audit and monitor 
authentication logs and activities. Be vigilant for any suspicious activities 
and take immediate action in the event of unauthorized access attempts.
•	
User Education: Educate users on the importance of strong authentication 
and the risks associated with weak authentication practices. Provide guidance 
on creating and managing strong passwords.
•	
Compliance: Ensure that your strong authentication implementation aligns 
with industry-specific compliance regulations and requirements, such as 
HIPAA, GDPR, or PCI DSS, as applicable.
•	
Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess your authentication mechanisms 
and consider adopting the latest security technologies and methods as they 
evolve.
Strong authentication methods significantly reduce unauthorized access to your 
cloud environment and protect sensitive data from potential breaches, making them 
a crucial part of a comprehensive cloud security strategy.
6. DATA SECURITY IN THE CLOUD

6.1 Data Encryption
•	
Data at Rest Encryption: Implement encryption for data stored in the cloud, 
ensuring that data is protected even when it is not actively being accessed. 
Most cloud providers offer encryption features for data at rest. Use encryption 
keys and manage them securely(Agrawal et al., 2023; Rahamathunnisa, 
Subhashini, et al., 2023; Srinivas et al., 2023).
•	
Data in Transit Encryption: Ensure that data transmitted to and from the 
cloud is encrypted using secure protocols such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS. 
Encryption during transit safeguards data as it traverses the internet or 
internal networks.
•	
End-to-End Encryption: When appropriate, use end-to-end encryption to 
protect data from the point of creation to the point of consumption. This 
ensures that data remains encrypted and confidential throughout its lifecycle.
•	
Key Management: Proper key management is crucial for data encryption. 
Securely manage encryption keys to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted 
data. Utilize hardware security modules (HSMs) for added protection.

Categories may include public, internal, confidential, and restricted. Assign 
clear labels to data to indicate its classification level(P. R. Kumar et al., 2023; 
Maguluri et al., 2023; Venkateswaran, Kumar, et al., 2023).
•	
Access Controls: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and assign 
permissions based on data classification. Ensure that only authorized users 
can access, modify, or delete data based on their roles and the sensitivity of 
the data.
•	
Data Retention and Disposal Policies: Establish policies for data retention 
and disposal. Regularly review and purge data that is no longer needed, 
especially sensitive data that poses a security risk if retained.
•	
Data Access Auditing: Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms 
to track who accesses and modifies data. Regularly review access logs and 
investigate any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
•	
Data Leakage Prevention: Implement controls to prevent unintentional 
data leakage. This includes preventing data from being sent outside the 
organization by email, cloud storage, or other means.
6.3 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
•	
DLP Solutions: Deploy DLP solutions that can monitor, detect, and prevent 
the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data. These solutions use content 
inspection and contextual analysis to enforce security policies(Agrawal et al., 
2023; Rahamathunnisa, Subhashini, et al., 2023).
•	
Policy-Based Controls: Define and enforce DLP policies that specify what 
types of data are sensitive and how they should be handled. Policies can be 
configured to block, quarantine, or alert on data leakage incidents.
•	
User Training and Awareness: Educate users about DLP policies, 
data handling best practices, and the importance of protecting sensitive 
information. Make them aware of the risks of data leakage.
•	
Cloud DLP Integration: If using cloud services, consider integrating DLP 
solutions that can monitor and protect data within the cloud environment. 
This is especially important if sensitive data is stored or processed in the 
cloud.

17
Securing Cloud Infrastructure in IaaS and PaaS Environments
•	
Incident Response: Develop an incident response plan for DLP incidents. 
This plan should outline steps to take when a data leakage incident occurs, 
including notification, containment, investigation, and remediation.
Implementing a comprehensive approach to cloud data protection, including 
encryption, data classification, and Data Logging (DLP), can help organizations 
reduce data breaches and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of their sensitive 
information.
7. CLOUD NETWORK SECURITY

level to control traffic that enters and exits the VPC. NACLs provide an 
additional layer of security beyond security groups.
•	
Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls: Understand the difference between stateful 
and stateless firewalls. Security groups in the cloud are stateful, meaning 
they automatically allow return traffic for outbound connections. NACLs are 
stateless and require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.
•	
Application Layer Firewalls (WAF): For web applications, consider using a 
Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web application 
attacks and to inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

(IDPS) to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activities or security 
threats. These systems analyze network packets and can take automated 
actions to block or contain threats.
•	
Signature-Based and Anomaly-Based Detection: IDPS solutions often 
use signature-based detection (identifying known patterns of attacks) 
and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from normal network 
behavior) to identify threats.
•	
Custom Rules: Create custom rules within the IDPS to detect specific threats 
or vulnerabilities relevant to your environment.
•	
Alerting and Incident Response: Configure alerting mechanisms so that 
security incidents are promptly reported to your incident response team.

ABSTRACT
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
technologies has had a significant impact on cloud security, as it has in many 
other sectors. This abstract examines how AI and ML are affecting cloud security, 
highlighting their major contributions, difficulties, and potential. Traditional 
approaches to cloud security provide improved threat detection, real-time monitoring, 
and adaptive defense mechanisms. These technologies are adept at processing 
enormous volumes of data, allowing them to spot trends, anomalies, and potential 
dangers that more traditional security measures would miss. In order to quickly 
identify and take appropriate action in response to unauthorised access, data

Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
1. INTRODUCTION
An innovative tool called artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to provide 
analytics and intelligence to defend against continuously evolving cyberattacks by 
quickly scanning millions of events and keeping an eye on a variety of cyberthreats 
in order to foresee issues and take appropriate action. As a result (K, 2023), there 
are numerous applications of AI that either assist human security personnel or 
completely automate them. There is an increasing trend towards using AI in cyber 
defence. Increased interest among academics in cybersecurity and AI has led to a 
plethora of studies addressing topics related to cyberidentification, cyberprotection, 
cyberdetection, cyberreaction, and cyberrecovery (Saini et al., 2023; Sudha & 
Akiladevi, 2022).
Cybersecurity policies, procedures, and technical measures are implemented to 
protect information and communication systems and the data they contain against 
compromise, unauthorised use or modification, and exploitation. Accelerating 
technical development and innovation, as well as the ever-evolving nature of cyber 
threats (K, 2023; Nassif et al., 2021), compound the difficulty of the challenge. In 
light of this hitherto unseen difficulty, AI-based cybersecurity tools have emerged 
to provide valuable assistance to security teams in efficiently mitigating threats and 
bolstering security. Due to the diversity of AI and cybersecurity, a standardised 
taxonomy is necessary for reviewing research on using AI to cybersecurity. Researchers 
and practitioners will benefit from having a shared knowledge of the technological 
processes and services that need to be enhanced using AI thanks to this standardised 
taxonomy shown in Figure 1.a.
Before AI and ML reach unfathomable levels of accuracy and efficiency, this 
special issue (Sarirete et al., 2022) is devoted to the study of them as aspects of 
data-driven innovation and digital transformation.An agenda and multidisciplinary 
research on AI and ML are required because of rising user expectations for technology 
and the benefits it provides to society (Lytras et al., 2021; Visvizi et al., 2020; Chui 
et al., 2020). The five main issues listed above should form the basis of any study 
proposal of this kind (Figure 1.b).
By DominikSowinsk state that, Cloud computing has been transformed by AI 
and machine learning (ML), which has improved performance, scalability, and 
breaches, and other malicious activities, AI-driven systems can quickly analyse 
user behaviour, network behaviour, and system logs. It introduces complexity in the 
form of adversarial assaults, model interpretability, and data privacy issues. For 
users to trust AI-driven security systems and to comprehend their decision-making 
processes, openness of these systems is essential.

efficiency. Through automation, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, they 
help to optimise operations. However, a wider spectrum of security threats is now 
associated with cloud computing because to the increasing accessibility and ubiquity 
of AI. The threat of adversarial assaults utilising AI has increased as access to 
AI tools has expanded. Aware adversaries are able to generate false or inaccurate

information by using ML models for evasion, poisoning, or model inversion assaults. 
The number of possible enemies who are able to exploit these models and cloud 
settings grows as AI technologies become more commonplace.
1.1 New Tools, New Threats
One of the most concerning advances, though, is the use of AI by adversaries to find 
cloud weaknesses and produce malware. AI is a powerful weapon for cybercriminals 
because it can automate and expedite the discovery of vulnerabilities. They can use 
AI to analyse patterns, spot vulnerabilities, and take advantage of them more quickly 
than security professionals can react. AI may also produce sophisticated malware 
that evolves and learns to avoid detection, making it more challenging to stop.
These security issues are made more difficult by AI’s lack of openness. The 
interpretation of AI systems, particularly deep learning models, is difficult, making 
it difficult to diagnose and address security concerns. Such occurrences are more 
likely now that a larger user base has access to AI. The benefit of AI’s automation 
also brings with it a serious security risk: reliance. The effect of an AI system failure 
or security breach increases as more services rely on it. It is more difficult to pinpoint 
and fix this problem in the distributed cloud system without affecting service.
2. CLOUDCOMPUTING
Internet connectivity is used to access a variety of services using cloud computing. 
Included in this are server systems, database systems, networking infrastructure, 
and application infrastructure (Gutierrez & Lee, 2020; Halabi & Bellaiche, 2017; 
Kumar & Alphonse, 2018; Linguistics, 2017). By utilising cloud computing, it is no 
longer necessary to save data on an individual’s computer or other device (Asharaf 
et al., 2023). Apps and information are accessible to digital users whenever they 
have Internet access.
2.1 Threat to Cloud Security
Figure 2 illustrates the serious problem of data security in the cloud, which is 
especially problematic given the sensitive nature of the data stored and processed 
there.1.a. Individuals and organisations should be aware of the various threats to 
cloud security and take precautions to counter them (Halabi & Bellaiche, 2018). 
These dangers include, among others:
Unauthorised access to private data kept in the cloud constitutes a data breach. 
Attackers may get unauthorised access to important data by taking advantage of 

38
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
flaws in the cloud architecture, lax authentication, or improperly configured access 
controls. Inadequate Identity, Credential, and Access Management: Unauthorised 
access may result from improper management of user identities, credentials, and 
access rights (Dilek et al., 2015). Unauthorised users have a higher chance of 
accessing cloud resources if there are lax password regulations, shared credentials, 
and no multi-factor authentication.
CC will experience tremendous and widespread development. There are a number 
of risks that could cause protection and security issues. The analysis is based on the 
CIA feature and cloud hazards.
To protect the Cloud against potential threats and prevent harm, it is necessary 
to recognise and understand the types of assaults that can be launched. The assaults 
in cloud computing that get the most discussion The following are in Grusho et al. 
(2017), Gutierrez & Lee (2020), and Kumar et al. (2016):
a. 	
Attacks on denial of service (DoS) aim to reduce the users’ access to services. 
Distributed denial of service allows multiple computers to perform a single 
attack (DDoS).
Figure 3. Threats to cloud security

39
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
b. 	
When an attacker uses legitimate hosts on the network to hammer a victim 
with requests, this is known as a zombieattack. Such an attack prevents Cloud 
from acting as it is expected to, which affects Cloud services’ availability.
c. 	
Phishing attack: involves tricking individuals into clicking on a fake link in 
order to get their personal information.
d. 	
The “Man in the Middle” attack happens when a third party intercepts or 
modifies the data being transmitted between two users. Cloud-based information 
exchanges are vulnerable to espionage.
3. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ANALYSIS
Figure 3.a depicts in full the study’s selection approach. After selecting and employing 
a search keyword in Scopus, 2395 studies were retrieved; these were then narrowed 
down using the inclusion and exclusion criteria (K, 2023). After excluding works not 
written in English, posters, reviews, surveys, editorials, books, chapters, workshop 
and symposium abstracts, duplicates, guidelines, and comparative studies, a total 
of 2029 publications remained. Twenty-two hundred and nine papers were read for 
their abstracts and titles. The review made it clear in the title and abstract if the 
study was irrelevant since it fell outside the scope of the review.

3.1 Automated Evaluation and Detection of Vulnerabilities
An automated vulnerability assessment is a methodical investigation into the state 
of a system’s security using automated tools for locating, categorising, investigating, 
and ranking vulnerabilities. Automated solutions detect, categorise, and rank 
vulnerabilities using asset management systems, threat intelligence feeds, vendor 
vulnerability bulletins, and vulnerability repositories.
Automated vulnerability identification is a crucial step in locating weaknesses 
in servers, applications, and other assets of a company. Deep learning and transfer 
learning have been used by researchers to check the source code in order to detect 
software vulnerabilities (K, 2023; Leo et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2012). In order to 
aid developers in creating more secure code, researchers in these projects mine text 
for vulnerabilities using machine learning.
Researchers employ AI-based fuzzing to find security flaws in programmes and 
interfaces. One method is to inject malicious data into a programme or interface with 
the purpose of triggering errors like crashes, failed code assertions, illegal jumps or 
debug methods, and even memory leaks. An automated system for detecting attack 
possibilities, generating input, producing plausible test cases, and assessing crashes 
can be built using AI approaches, as shown in Figure 3.1.a. The clever fuzzing system 
uses techniques from logic and natural language processing to generate seeds, which 
it then uses to enhance code coverage via novel execution paths (Nassif et al., 2021; 
Sarirete et al., 2022).

4. CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES AND MODELS
The ability to provide services independently on demand, access to a vast network, 
sharing of resources, rapid scalability, and individualised support are all crucial. 
SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are the three most common ways in which cloud services 
are made available to customers, and all three are included in NIST’s definition of 
cloud computing (Halabi & Bellaiche, 2017). The NIST study also discusses the 
four cloud deployment models, each of which is characterised in terms of who has 
access to the cloud’s resources. Figure 4.a depicts the four different types of clouds: 
public, private, community, and hybrid.

computing

5. DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DoS) ATTACKS
Low-rate traffic that appears to be genuine traffic and high-rate traffic that simulates 
the simultaneous access of many users to a system without malicious intent (flash 
crowd) may both be seen throughout a distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack 
(Fang et al., 2012). Based on the protocol layer at which they are launched, DoS 
attacks are often categorised as follows:
a. 	
Network/transport-level DoS assault: The attacker uses network and transport 
layer protocols to exert control over the targeted system. Protocols like TCP, 
UDP, ICMP, and DNS are frequently used for these tasks.
b. 	
Application-level DoS attacks: Attacks at the application level are harder 
to detect since they have no distinguishing features and look like normal 
traffic rather than network or transport level attacks, despite using much less 
bandwidth. Application protocols including HTTP, DNS, and SIP are being 
used in these attacks due to their specific features.
In addition to application-level assaults, we need also mention HTTP flooding 
attacks, which fall into the following four categories.
a. 	
The Slow Header attack is also known as the Slowworms attack, after the tool 
used in the attack. In this scenario, the number of incomplete HTTP requests 
(missing headers) sent to the target server grows indefinitely. All of the available 
connections to the web server have been used, rendering the service unavailable 
(Nassif et al., 2021).
b. 	
In an HTTP fragmentation attack, the attacker first connects to the target 
web server through HTTP, then splits a benign packet into smaller pieces and 
patiently steers each one in the direction of the intended victim. This allows the 
attacker to keep a large number of connections active for an extended period 
of time.
c. 	
Attack from the slow post is similar to the one before, but in this instance, 
the attacker sends the first packet with the content-length value and then 
progressively transmits HTTP post commands with little data.
d. 	
It takes time for the attacker to read the answer from the victim web server 
because d) the attacker’s receive window is smaller than the victim’s transmit 
buffer. With TCP, the attacker can force the victim to maintain a high number 
of connections even if no data is being transmitted between them.
As depicted in Figure 5.a, during an HTTP DoS attack, packet data is collected 
and filtered so that only packets associated with request flooding or slow request/

Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
response attacks are examined. Attackers may use reflectors or botnets to mimic the 
effects of earlier strikes in order to boost the effectiveness of these Slow Rate DoS 
attacks (Kumar & Alphonse, 2018). It is crucial to note that the suggested solution 
can detect the onset of these attacks, allowing for quick detection and assisting 
the cloud administrator in taking action to mitigate the attack. In this instance, the 
implementation also permits, which is another crucial element.
6. ECONOMIC DENIAL OF SUSTAINABILITY 
ATTACK DETECTION SYSTEMS
DDoS attacks are prevalent, whereas EDoS attacks are relatively recent. But an EDoS 
assault might ruin a cloud service provider’s reputation with their customers and 
perhaps lead to bankruptcy (Aldhyani & Alkahtani, 2022; Gutierrez & Lee, 2020). 
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, on the other hand, can temporarily 
block access to a service for its intended audience. They are more advanced and 
Figure 7. Enhancing cloud computing analysis

Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
modern than DDoS attacks, making it harder to detect them. Figure 6.a illustrates 
the indirect and direct manner in which EDoS threatens cloud computing. EDoS 
attacks take advantage of the cloud’s capacity to automatically launch more virtual 
machines in order to overwhelm its targets. The cost of this unauthorised malicious 
use falls on the cloud service provider.
The difficulty of EDoS detection has been addressed using a variety of ways. 
SVM and self-organizing maps (SOM), two machine learning approaches, have 
been successful in identifying DDoS attacks (Halabi & Bellaiche, 2017; Kumar 
& Alphonse, 2018). Traditional machine learning methods, however, struggle to 
interpret massive EDoS data in network applications due to their reliance on feature 
engineering and selection. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML that makes use 
of neural layers, can be utilised to address ML’s shortcomings and increase data 
extraction, detection accuracy, and robustness. In order to solve difficult issues, DL 
algorithms make use of many nonlinear processing units and a wide range of neural 
network models inspired by the human brain.

7. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTRUSION DETECTION
Artificial intelligence (AI) can be thought of as (i) the study of how humans think 
in order to design similarly intelligent machines, or (ii) the study of how to solve 
difficult problems that necessitate intelligence (such as making good decisions 
based on a large amount of data). The second definition is the one most relevant to 
the use of AI in cyber protection. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) seeks to 
create computer programmes that can simulate human intelligence by performing 
tasks like learning, reasoning, planning, etc. in an automated fashion (Chinnaiah & 
Niranjan, 2018; Fang et al., 2012; Leo et al., 2023).
The fundamental issue of mimicking intelligence has been subdivided into 
more narrowly focused subproblems, each of which has certain characteristics or 
abilities that an intelligent system ought to possess. The qualities listed below have 
received the greatest attention (Dilek et al., 2015; Halabi & Bellaiche, 2017; Kumar 
& Alphonse, 2018):

Learning (machine learning), planning (multi-agent planning and cooperation), 
and knowledge representation (ontologies), information retrieval (text mining, 
machine translation), natural language processing (navigation, localization, 
mapping, motion planning), motion and manipulation (localization, speech 
recognition, facial recognition), and perception (speech recognition, facial 
recognition) are just a few of the topics covered.
Although established procedures for protecting information while in transit over 
networks and the Internet, such as antivirus software, firewalls, encryption, and 
secure protocols, hackers can constantly come up with new ways to target network 
systems. An IDPS is a piece of hardware or software that is deployed within a 
network and has the ability to both identify possible intrusions and try to prevent 
them. Monitoring, detecting, analysing, and respondingto unauthorised actions are 
the four key security functions thatIDPSs serve shown in Figure 7.a.
8. AI APPLICATIONS TO THE DEFENCE OF CYBERCRIME
In the fight against cybercrime, AI methods have been widely deployed. “Denial of 
Service (DoS) detection,” “computer worm detection,” “spam detection,” “zombie 
detection,” “malware classification,” and “forensic investigations” are all examples 
of applications for neural networks. (Leo et al., 2023). Neural networks, for instance, 
can be used to detect and stop intrusions. Modern anti-virus solutions now integrate 
a number of AI techniques, including heuristics, data mining, neural networks, and 
AISs (Fang et al., 2012). Intelligent agent technology is used by many IDSs, and it 
is often paired with mobile agent technology. To investigate potentially malicious 
internet activity, intelligent mobile agents are allowed to move around between 
data collection nodes (Sarirete et al., 2022). Heuristic technology, defined as “the 
knowledge and abilities that app several techniques for figuring out and intelligently 
analysing codes to find the unidentified virus during scanning” (Fang et al., 2012) 
is the future of anti-virus detection technology, according to Wang et al. (2008).
8.1 Artificial Neural Network Applications
ANNs are computer algorithms that attempt to simulate the structure and activity 
of biological neural networks. They excel in very complex and ever-changing 
computer environments where predictions, classifications, and controls are required. 
a neural network system that coordinates the collection and analysis of data from

multiple sources, as well as the detection and reporting of abnormalities, alarms, 
and corrective measures. Experiments show that Neuro Net can successfully defend 
against distributed denial-of-service attacks that focus on TCP at low rates.
8.2 Agent Applications
Cooperatively responding to novel conditions, artificially intelligent agents are 
computer-generated teams that are both self-aware and computer-generated. They 
communicate with one another to share data. Intelligent agent technology is ideally 
suited for thwarting cyberattacks due to their adaptability to their deployment 
surroundings, mobility, and cooperative nature.
8.3 Artificial Immune System Applications
The purpose of AISs, like that of biological immune systems they ape, is to maintain 
stability in the face of disruption. In immune-based intrusion detection (), immunocytes 
undergo evolution (self-tolerance, cloning, variation, etc.) while antigens are detected 
simultaneously. To combat pathogens, the immune system creates antibodies, and 
changes in antibody concentration can be used to gauge how intense the infiltration 
is. As a result, AISs are crucial to the study of cyber security.
8.4 Advantages of AI Applications to IDPSs
There are many benefits that AI approaches bring to intrusion detection and 
prevention (see Table 1).
9. ATTRIBUTE BASED ENCRYPTION
According to Kamara and Lauter (2010), attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a 
type of public key cryptography that gives authorised users discrete and safe access 
to shared data. The user’s secret key needs to be connected to an access policy in 
order for data encrypted using ABE features to be decrypted (Halabi & Bellaiche, 
2017). Decryption is only feasible if the user’s credentials are valid and adhere to the 
access rules. It offers revocation, collusion resistance, and scalability. It is helpful to 
divide ABE into “Key Policy Attribute Based Encryption” (KPABE) and “Cypher 
Policy Attribute Based Encryption” (CPABE), which are its constituent pieces. The 
access rules of KPABE are depicted in Figure 9.a and serve to safeguard both the 
ciphertext and the user’s private keys. CPABE generates user ciphertext and secret 
keys based on the methods shown in Figure 9.b.

Certain parameters must be established before any data may be encrypted. The 
Authority, the data owner, and the data user are the three parties involved in data use. 
The authority generates a master secret key for data encryption and then provides it

50
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
with the data owner, as shown in Figure 9.c. Additionally, the authority constructs 
the user’s secret key using the master secret key and the characteristics given in 
Table 9.1. A public key is delivered to the owner of data or metadata saved in the 
cloud prior to storage (Chinnaiah & Niranjan, 2018; Gutierrez & Lee, 2020; Kumar 
et al., 2016). Access to the sender’s private key is required in order to decrypt the 
message. For the encrypted data to be deciphered, it must match the secret key.
Setup: The bilinear map will be denoted as: G1 X G1 G2. The authority generates 
the Public Key (PK) and Master Secret Key (MSK) using non-zero random numbers 
x1, x2,...,xn, and y obtained from the prime integer Zp.

10. AI SECURITY CHALLENGES IN CLOUD
AI brings complicated security problems to cloud systems, which necessitates 
proactive measures and strategic planning. Best practises must be adopted as part 
of a company’s digital transformation journey in order to guarantee the security of 
cloud services (Sowinski, 2023).
10.1 Privacy and Security Concerns
As artificial intelligence (AI) develops further, there are worries about how these 
new technologies may affect our security and privacy. For instance, if AI is used 
to track our online behaviour, it might be used to gather private information about 
our lives. Additionally, if AI is employed to develop self-driving automobiles, there 
may be dangers if these systems are compromised.
AI systems are also susceptible to sophisticated attacks. Some individuals 
mistakenly believe that AI solutions are impenetrable, but this is just untrue. Good 
attackers can fool and circumvent AI, but by assuming perfect security, businesses 
run the risk of becoming complacent and becoming exposed.
10.2 Data Is Very Siloed, Incomplete, or Unstructured
Both the deployment of artificial intelligence and its adaption are expanding quickly. 
Unstructured data is still a problem for AI, though. Unstructured data is data that is 

52
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
difficult to organise and interpret because it lacks a specified data model or structure. 
This can be in the form of text, pictures, or videos.
Unstructured data might be more challenging to deal with, but it can also hold a 
wealth of important information. When it comes to making decisions, unstructured 
data can frequently be more significant than organised data. This is due to the fact that 
unstructured data frequently offers more context and specificity than organised data.
The requirement to protect cloud services from malicious actors grows in 
importance as cloud services become more widely used. And while there are many 
techniques available to assist safeguard cloud environments, artificial intelligence 
(AI) is among the most promising (Sowinski, 2023). Threats that would otherwise 
go unnoticed can be recognised and countered with AI assistance. However, there 
are several difficulties with employing AI for security.
a. 	
Implement effective access control: The security of your cloud environment 
depends on this. Follow the principle of least privilege by giving each user 
or programme only the minimal amount of access. For all users, multi-factor 
authentication ought to be required. To further limit access, think about utilising 
role-based access controls.
b. 	
Make use of encryption: Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and 
at rest to prevent unauthorised access. Additionally, strong key management 
procedures should be used to guarantee that keys are changed frequently and 
kept in a safe place.
c. 	
Install intrusion detection and security monitoring systems: Your cloud 
environment should be continuously monitored in order to spot potential risks 
and unusual behaviour. Implementing intrusion detection systems with AI-
powered threat analysis can improve this monitoring. Particular advantages 
over agentless solutions are provided by agent-based technologies, which take 
use of the ability to interface directly with your environment and automate 
incident response.
d. 	
Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments: Vulnerability 
assessments that are performed on a regular basis can reveal potential flaws 
in your cloud infrastructure. Combine them with penetration testing to mimic 
actual attacks and gauge your organization’s resistance against them.
e. 	
Adopt a security plan that is cloud-native: Accept the special security 
features and resources provided by your cloud service provider. Make sure you 
are adhering to your portion of the security requirement by understanding the 
shared responsibility paradigm. Use native cloud security tools from providers 
like Google Cloud Security Command Centre, AWS Security Hub, and Azure 
Security Centre.

53

10.3 AI’s Advantages for Cloud Security
In terms of cloud security, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more 
significant (). AI can assist companies in better protecting this sensitive information 
when they shift their data and applications to the cloud.
a. 	
Less Need for Human Intervention
The use of AI in cloud security has numerous advantages. AI has the potential to 
uncover hazards that people would overlook and to shed light on the tactics used by 
attackers. AI can also be used to proactively respond to problems and automatically 
thwart attacks. Azure Sentinel, part of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, is one 
illustration of this. Based on the kind of alert that sentinel issues, this solution allows 
incident responses to automatically start security remediation. This indicates that 
problems can be found and fixed by the system without the need for human interaction.
b. 	
Processing of Big Data
Big data is a term used to describe the enormous amount of data that businesses 
produce every day. Various sources of this information include clickstream data, 
transactions, and social media. Organisations have a number of difficulties when 
processing big data since it can be challenging to store and manage such vast amounts 
of data. Big data, however, also offers a number of benefits for businesses that can 
efficiently manage and make use of it. Big data can be utilised to enhance decision-
making, find fresh business prospects, and streamline operational procedures.
c. 	
Using automated technologies to delegate
As automated technologies advance, artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly 
hand off duties to them. This is done to give the AI more time to concentrate on 
more difficult jobs or those that call for human judgement. This trend has several 
advantages, including improved precision and efficiency. The possibility of losing 
a job as more and more jobs are transferred to automated technology is one of the 
concerns, though. Overall, there are both advantages and concerns associated with 
AI delegating to automated systems. We will be better equipped to control these 
risks and realise the full promise of this technology as we gain greater insight into 
the possibilities of AI.
d. 	
Event Recognition and Prevention:

54
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
The power of artificial intelligence to identify and prevent potential events 
increases in sophistication. A method called artificial intelligence (AI) event detection 
and blocking is used to keep an eye out for future events and stop them before they 
happen. There are numerous potentials uses for I event detection and blocking. It 
can be used to stop terrorist attacks, stop crime, and generally keep people secure. 
Additionally, it can be utilised to avoid accidents, safeguard confidential data, and 
stand up to natural calamities. The forecasting of hurricanes is a typical instance 
of this.
11. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
11.1 Cloud Security Areas
These include data confidentiality, data privacy, DoS, and DDoS as well as 
vulnerability detection, intrusion detection, malware detection, privacy preservation, 
anomaly detection, and attack detection. The percentage, frequency, and quantity 
Table 3. Field of cloud security discovered from gathered research articles
Table 4. Cited works used in this research project

55
Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cloud Security
of research articles in each subfield of cloud security are shown in Table 11.1.1. In 
Table 11.1.2, a few of the Reference papers are included.
Searching finding deviations from the norm in data is what anomaly detection is 
all about. Anomaly detection is essential because data outliers represent important 
and often key information that may be put to use in numerous contexts. A total of 
six papers address the topic of anomaly detection. However, we found that three 
of these studies specifically address the problem of identifying anomalous user 
conduct. The first three papers in Table 11.1.3 discuss cloud-based anomaly detection 
frameworks and systems. papers A4 and A5 also investigate anomalies, but their 
focus is on behavioural ones.
12. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have had a 
profound impact on cloud security, bringing with them both advancements and 
concerns. Positively, AI and ML have considerably improved cloud security by 
making threat detection and response methods more effective. These tools can 
instantly analyse enormous volumes of data to spot patterns and anomalies that 
human operators might overlook. As a result (Dilek et al., 2015), possible security 
breaches are identified more quickly, false positives are decreased, and total incident 
response times are improved. The growth of predictive analytics in cloud security 
has also been aided by AI and ML. These solutions estimate security threats and

vulnerabilities based on past data, enabling organisations to proactively correct 
flaws before unscrupulous parties may take advantage of them.
Furthermore, regular security processes like log analysis, authentication, and 
authorization can greatly benefit from automation thanks to AI and ML. This lessens 
the workload for security staff while also lowering the chance of human error in 
security operations. These improvements do, however, also present difficulties. A 
serious threat comes from adversarial attacks, in which perpetrators manipulate AI 
systems to make bad choices. Additionally, the intricacy of AI and ML models can 
make them vulnerable to flaws, which could make them a target for cybercriminals. 
Concerns exist regarding the ethical ramifications of AI and ML in cloud security 
as well. Important difficulties that must be addressed include privacy concerns, 
decision-making that is biased, and the lack of transparency in AI systems.

ABSTRACT
Data refers to raw facts and figures. After processing data, the information is created. 
Information like facts or statistics that can be recorded, stored, and analysed can be 
in various forms such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video. The amount of data 
generated every day in the data-driven world of today makes it nearly difficult to 
keep it all locally. Cloud services are being used by so many people and businesses 
to store these massive and hefty volumes of data on cloud servers. Additionally, as 
the need for cloud computing grows, so does the need for data recovery methods 
and services. The ability to recover data and information from the backup server 
when the primary server is down is the primary goal of recovery services and 
technologies. A secondary server to hold backups for the primary cloud server 
will be more expensive to add than the primary server itself, which is already 
quite expensive and time-consuming to build. The goal of this chapter is to provide 
realistic, cost-effective solutions to this urgent problem.

Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
1. INTRODUCTION
Data refers to any information, facts, or statistics that can be recorded, stored, and 
analysed. It can be in various forms such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video. 
In the context of computing and technology, data often refers to digital information 
that is stored and processed by computer systems. This data can be structured or 
unstructured, and can be generated from a variety of sources such as sensors, software 
applications, or user input. Data is an essential component of many fields such as 
business, science, medicine, and engineering. It can be used to make informed 
decisions, discover patterns or trends, and gain insights into various phenomena. 
However, data alone is not useful until it is processed, analysed, and interpreted.
Electronic data production has reached an unprecedented scale, leading to a 
significant challenge for companies to store it. The traditional solution of using 
hard disk drives (HDDs) with terabytes of storage capacity is no longer sufficient to 
meet the data storage demands of IT companies. Even constructing an entire storage 
facility may not solve the problem, as the volume of data generated by companies 
continues to grow at an exponential rate.
To address this challenge, cloud computing was introduced. This innovative 
technology enables users to store their data on a remote cloud server rather than 
on their personal computers, freeing up valuable physical storage space. Accessing 
the data is as easy as logging into the cloud account, and cloud services are often 
more cost-effective than building a large-scale storage facility.
The widespread adoption of cloud computing has not been limited to businesses 
alone, as individuals also seek to leverage its benefits for data storage. However, 
this increased demand has also led to the risk of data loss. To mitigate this risk, 
cloud-based data recovery and backup procedures have been developed, providing 
additional layers of protection to ensure that valuable data is not lost due to unforeseen 
events such as hardware failure, cyber-attacks, or human error.
One significant advantage of cloud computing is its scalability. Businesses and 
organizations can easily scale their storage and computing resources up or down based 
on their changing needs, without having to invest in new hardware or infrastructure. 
This is especially useful for businesses with fluctuating demand, such as those in 
the retail or hospitality industry, where demand can vary based on seasonality or 
market trends. With cloud computing, businesses can quickly and easily adjust their 
storage and computing capacity, allowing them to be more agile and responsive to 
changing market conditions.
Another benefit of cloud computing is its accessibility. Cloud-based storage and 
computing resources can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, 
allowing businesses and individuals to work remotely or collaborate with others 
in different locations. This has become increasingly important in the wake of the 

61
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
COVID-19 pandemic, as more businesses and organizations have shifted to remote 
work arrangements. With cloud computing, employees can access the same data 
and resources from their home offices as they would in the physical office, making 
remote work more seamless and efficient.
2. CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing as a concept has its roots in the early days of computing. The idea 
of accessing remote computing resources was first proposed by J.C.R. Licklider, a 
computer scientist who worked on early developments in time-sharing and networking 
in the 1960s (“Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia”, 2023). He envisioned a 
future in which people could access computer power and applications from anywhere 
in the world, over a network of interconnected machines.
However, it was not until the 1990s that cloud computing started to take shape as 
we know it today. At that time, the internet was gaining widespread adoption, and 
companies began to realize the potential of hosting their applications and data online. 
This led to the development of Application Service Providers (ASPs), which offered 
businesses the ability to rent access to their software applications over the internet.

Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
The term “cloud computing” was first used in 1996 by Compaq Computer, which 
used it to describe the delivery of computing services over the internet (“Solved 
Magazine. The history of cloud computing”, 2023). In 2002, Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) launched its cloud computing platform, which offered on-demand access 
to computing resources such as storage, computing power, and database services.
The development of virtualization technology was a significant factor in the 
growth of cloud computing. Virtualization enables multiple virtual machines to 
run on a single physical machine, allowing for greater efficiency and utilization of 
computing resources. This technology paved the way for cloud providers to offer 
scalable and flexible computing services to their customers (Greeshmanth, R. C., 
et al., 2023).
Today, cloud computing has become an integral part of modern computing 
infrastructure, powering everything from online applications to scientific research 
projects (Daabseha, T. K. I. K., et al., 2023). With the rise of the internet of things 
(IoT) and the increasing volume of data being generated, cloud computing is expected 
to continue to play a critical role in enabling businesses and individuals to store, 
process, and analyse data (Ajeh, D. E., et, al., 2014). One of the most common and 
frequently used technologies in use today is cloud computing (Koley, S., et al., 2014). 
In essence, it gives customers access to a virtual machine or platform online where 
they can host or store their data and other documents. In addition to offering users 
and businesses with insufficient storage space a cheaper alternative to purchasing 
a storage device, one of the main reasons cloud computing (Koley, S., et, al., 2014) 
gained such rapid popularity was due to how simple it was to use. Its ease of use was 
a secondary factor. The only things a user really needs are an internet connection 
and a way to connect to the cloud server (Alarifi, A., et al., 2020).
Data processing is distributed among numerous machines that are connected 
through a network in cloud computing (Alzoubi, K., et al., 2020). This cloud 
architecture’s systems are intimately linked together. Through virtualized pools, 
cloud computing (Koley, S., et al., 2014) power is maximised. It provides its services 
digitally in order to protect the privacy of its customers. Data management and 
access are made possible by virtualization’s secure environment (Suganya, M., et 
al., 2023). Users’ ability to use the computing environment is improved (Brezany, 
P., et al. 2017). To prevent other users from accessing the data of one user, the cloud 
service provider regularly refreshes its resources, including its servers, networks, 
storage, servers, and apps (El Haloui, M., et al., 2017). These components work 
together to create the complex technology known as “cloud computing.”

3. NEED FOR CLOUD BACKUP
As was mentioned earlier in the introduction, an increasing number of people and 
businesses are adopting cloud services these days to host and store data, making 
the cloud server a top choice for data storage (Dang, L. M., et al., 2019). A serious 
fear of data loss also comes along with that obligation. Cloud servers now house 
a variety of sensitive data for numerous businesses and individuals (Hai, T., et al., 
2023). What if a cloud server leaks data? What if a server in the cloud is breached? 
What if a cloud server malfunctions? What if a leak occurs while the data is being 
sent to the cloud server?
What would happen if an earthquake, tsunami, or other natural disaster caused 
a cloud server to be destroyed? A cloud server’s data loss can happen in a number 
of different ways. Now, it is the duty of the cloud provider to reassure its clients 
regarding data security and protection (Hassan, H., et al., 2017). As a result, it 
becomes necessary to have a recovery strategy and backup to guarantee that, even 
in the event of a data breach or loss from the primary cloud server, the data can still 
be safely restored (Khan, N., et al., 2016). The resource pool architecture (Koley, S., 
et al., 2015) used in cloud server (Koley, S., et al., 2015) can store data efficiently.
In a nutshell the benefits of cloud computing can be summarised as
Figure 2. Need for cloud backup

64
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
3.1 Scalability
One of the key advantages of cloud computing is its scalability. Cloud providers offer 
access to a vast pool of computing resources that can be scaled up or down based 
on the user’s needs. This enables businesses to handle sudden spikes in demand 
without having to invest in additional hardware or infrastructure (Li, K. (2017).
3.2 Flexibility
Cloud computing offers the flexibility to access their data and applications from 
anywhere in the world, as long as they have an internet connection. This makes it 
ideal for remote working, collaboration, and access to critical data (Mahan, F., et 
al., 2021).
3.3 Cost-Effectiveness
Cloud computing is often more cost-effective than traditional computing models, as it 
eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure. 
Additionally, cloud providers often offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, which 
enable businesses to pay only for the resources they use (Jaatun, M.G., et al., 2017).
3.4 Security
Cloud providers often have robust security measures in place to protect their users’ 
data. This includes features such as encryption, access controls, and regular security 
audits (Wu, Y., et al., 2023).
3.5 Disaster Recovery
Cloud computing offers users the ability to back up their data and applications to 
remote servers, providing a robust disaster recovery solution in the event of a hardware 
failure, natural disaster, or other unforeseen events (Selvarajan, S., et al., 2023).
3.6 Minimize Risk
Cloud computing also minimizes the risk of data loss (Hewa, T., et al., 2022)..
Overall, cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses and individual 
access and store data, enabling greater efficiency, flexibility, and scalability in 
computing infrastructure (|Jena, M., et al., 2022).

4. EXISTING METHODS AND TECHNIQUES 
FOR CLOUD BACKUP
4.1 High Security Distribution and Rake Technology (HS-DRT)
The HS-DRT is a backup idea that makes use of high-speed encryption technology 
with a widely dispersed data transport method (Mittal, H., et al., 2022). It shows 
promise as an effective method for mobile clients like laptops, cell phones, and other 
devices, but it is unable to manage data duplication or the cheap cost of recovery 
implementation (Rawai, N. M., et al., 2013). It is made up of three parts: The 
datacentre, the supervisory server, and the various client nodes that the administrator 
has specified are the first three main functions (Rigdon, E. E., et al., 2017).
PCs, cell phones, network-attached storage, and storage services make up the 
client nodes. They also have a secure network connection to the data centre and 
a supervisory server (Shakeabubakor, A. A., et al., 2015). The backup sequence 
and the recovery sequence are the two steps that this proposed system takes. In the 
backup sequence, it receives the data that needs to be backed up, and in the recovery 
sequence, the supervisory server (one of the HSDRT’s components), which can 
happen often or in the event of a disaster, receives the data that needs to be recovered 
(Teh, S. et al., 2016). It initiates the recuperation process.
Like the rake reception operation, it gathers the encrypted fragmentations 
from various suitable clients (Williams, D. R., et al., 2013). At the second stage, 
the decryption will be finished once the fragmentations have been merged and 
descrambled in reverse order (Heilig, L., et al., 2014). By following these steps, the 
original data that needs to be backed up can be obtained by the supervisory server.
This model, however, has some drawbacks, making it difficult to be hailed as a 
perfect backup and recovery solution. Those limitations are:
•	
In order to make full use of the HS-DRT processor, it is essential to ensure that 
the web applications are configured correctly to utilize the engine (Hwang, 
K., et al., 2014).
•	
Second, when more duplicate copies of file data are present, the web 
application’s performance will suffer on the related processor as a result 
(Khan, S., et al., 2015).
Advantages of using HS-DRT: HS-DRT is a scalable solution that can easily grow 
as your backup needs increase. User can add more servers and storage locations as 
needed, without affecting performance or reliability (Lal, P., et al., 2015).

66
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
•	
HS-DRT provides advanced security features that protect data from 
unauthorized access and potential threats such as hacking, malware, and 
ransomware. HS-DRT uses multiple layers of encryption and authentication 
to ensure that data is secure (Mueller, H., et al., 2017).
•	
HS-DRT uses a distributed architecture to speed up backup and restore times. 
This means that backup data is split into smaller chunks and distributed across 
multiple servers, which allows for faster backup and restore times (Burda, D., 
et al., 2015).
Disadvantages of using HS-DRT: The cost of implementing HS-DRT can be 
high, especially for small businesses or individuals. The cost of specialized hardware, 
software, and maintenance can add up quickly.
•	
Needed high-speed as well as reliable internet connection to access the data 
and perform backups or recoveries.
•	
In HS-DRT we may face some security risks such as data breaches, 
unauthorized access, malware attacks, or compliance violations if the cloud 
provider doesn’t have adequate security measures or policies.
Figure 3. High security distribution and rake technology
(Cloud, I., et al., 2014).

67
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
•	
In HS-DRT the user may not have much visibility or control over how their 
data is stored and managed by the cloud provider.
•	
It increases the redundancy.
4.2 Parity Cloud Service (PCS)
The Parity Cloud Service (PCS) is a highly straightforward, user-friendly, and 
practical parity-based data recovery method. In PCS, the original data is divided 
into multiple fragments or data block, and additional parity blocks are generated 
based on these data blocks. Each parity blocks contain information about the original 
data blocks and are used to reconstruct the data if any of the data blocks are lost or 
corrupted. The parity blocks are stored in different locations than the data blocks, 
providing additional protection against data loss due to hardware failures, natural 
disasters, or other events.
Data can be recovered from a PCS with an extremely high probability and 
at a reasonable cost. To gain public trust in a personal data recovery service, 
it’s vital to prioritize customer privacy and implement strong security measures 
such as encryption, multi-factor authentication, and secure data storage solutions. 
This approach can encourage users to confidently use the service without fear of 
compromising their sensitive data.
PCS can be used for a variety of applications, including backup and recovery, 
archiving, and disaster recovery. It can also be integrated with other cloud services, 
such as object storage or file systems, to provide a complete cloud backup solution.
A modern platform for privacy-protecting personal data recovery services is 
the Parity Cloud Service (PCS) (Adhikari, M., et al., 2017). Personal data recovery 
services should take four factors into account.
•	
Reliability.
•	
Efficiency in the economy.
•	
Convenience.
•	
Protection of privacy.
For data backup, PCS employs a novel method that creates virtual discs on the 
user’s computer, creates parity groups across those virtual discs, and stores the parity 
data of the parity group in the cloud (Koley, S. et al., 2022; Koley, S. et al., 2022). 
The exclusive OR is employed by the PCS algorithms to generate parity information.
Advantages of using PCS: When compared to other techniques, it is extremely 
dependable.

68
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
•	
PCS, uses parity recovery service to protect personal data from unauthorized 
access or disclosure.
•	
PCS requires a small storage space in the cloud for storing parity data, thus 
reducing cloud storage costs.
Disadvantages of using PCS: PCS is very complex to implement.
•	
It requires high internet connectivity for users to access user data.
•	
It stores user data on a third-party server which may pose security risks.
4.3 Cold and Hot Backup Service 
Replacement Strategy (CBSRS)
Copies of the actual database files make up physical backups. For instance, a physical 
backup might transfer database data from a local disc drive to a different safe place. 
Both hot and cold physical backups are possible.
Hot Backup: A hot backup is aback up performed on data while the database is 
actively online and accessible to users. It is a popular backup solution for multi-user 
Figure 4. Parity cloud service
(Hyungsoo, J., et al., 2017)

69
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
system s as no downtime is required. Though it may not capture all the changes 
made by users during the backup process.
During a hot backup, users can make changes to the database. The database and 
the backup copy are synchronised using the changes that were logged in the log 
files created during the backup. When a full backup is required but a cold backup 
would require system downtime due to the service level, a hot backup is employed.
Cold Backup: The database and the backup copy are always synced since users 
cannot make changes to the database while it is being cold backed up. Only when 
the service level permits the necessary system downtime is a cold backup employed.
Physical backups can be made in a full or incremental fashion. It is advised to 
do regular cold complete physical backups. It generates a duplicate of the data, 
which may include the control file, transaction files (redo logs), archive files, and 
data files from a database. By offering a mechanism to retrieve original data, this 
backup type defends against loss and protects data from application error. Depending 
on how frequently user’s data changes, perform this backup every week or every 
two weeks. It is advised to create cold complete backups so that users cannot make 
modifications while the backups are being made. Only modifications made since the 
last complete physical backup are captured. The premise is that only transaction log 
files produced after the last backup are stored, even though the files for databases 
vary. While the database is being used, incremental backup can be performed hot, 
but it decreases database performance.
Both cold backup and hot backup have distinctive qualities that make them 
particularly customized to satisfy consumers’ requirements. In contrast to hot backup, 
which is frequently accessed through Oracle, the primary provider, and is highly 
expensive to maintain, cold backup for data is easily accessible at a reasonable cost. 
To ensure data integrity, which might be compromised if the backup happens while 
data and files are in flux, cold backup only works when the database is shut down and 
inaccessible to users. On the other hand, hot backup is a technique for accelerating 
work processes in multiuser systems and is intended to execute concurrently with 
the database actively online and visible to users. Data security is increased with 
cold backups, and the likelihood of data corruption is decreased. On the other hand, 
Hot backup is meant to save and restore practically all database entities and delivers 
quick data recovery.
When utilized separately, cold backups can only offer access to a particular 
timeframe when needed for data recovery. The database enters shutdown status and 
is unreachable during the backup process. Given that the database must be offline 
while the backup is taking place, this interferes with regular work schedules. Hot 
backups are expensive to maintain, thus operators must exercise particular caution 
while deploying them. The backed-up data cannot be used for point-level recovery 
if the hot backup in the process fails.

70
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
Advantages of using CBSRS: The advantages of using CBSRS are as follows.
•	
CBSRS ensures that data remains available even in the event of a service 
failure.
•	
CBSRS can help minimize downtime in the event of a service failure by 
quickly replacing it with backup service.
•	
CBSRS provides flexibility as it can be used with both cold and hot backup 
services, providing different levels of data availability and recovery time.
Disadvantage of using CBSRS: The disadvantages of using CBSRS are as follows.
•	
As data volume grows, so does the cost of implementation.
•	
CBSRS can be easily scaled up or down as business needs change. Additional 
backup services can be added as needed to meet growing demand or scaled 
back during periods of lower demand.
•	
CBSRS can be more cost-effective than other backup strategies, particularly 
for business with limited budgets. Cold backups require less storage and 
compute resources, while hot backups can be more efficient in terms of 
storage usage.

4.4 Linux Box
A Linux server is one that utilizes the free and open-source Linux operating system. It 
offers businesses a low-cost method of giving their customers information, apps, and 
services. Due to Linux’s open-source nature, users have access to a vast community 
of supporters and resources. Linux (Ostroukh, A. V., et al., 2015) is used as the 
embedded operating system in a variety of devices, including network file systems, 
home appliances, and automobile entertainment systems. For routers, switches, DNS 
servers, home networking devices, and more, there are network operating systems. 
A crucial company concern is data backup.
Due to an increase in cyber threats, user error, and system flaws, user data is not 
secure. Backing up data ensures that important files and folders are not lost in the 
event of a security breach, an accidental deletion, or a system failure. Data backup 
is easy for individuals and small to medium-sized enterprises to perform, at least in 
part, using some kind of cloud architecture. However, data backup is complicated 
and frequently done, at least in part, on backup servers or external hard drives for 
large businesses where the amount of data is enormous (on the petabyte scale).
Linux Box generates a volume and ties it to an instance when the user needs to 
back up one. A volume is a virtual hard disc that is connected to a virtual machine 
(VM), which enhances performance and reduces latency. When a backup of the 
data in the VM is needed, volumes are typically attached. Data can be frequently 
backed up in the cloud using a Linux Box, lowering the possibility of data loss during 
emergencies. For small data sets, recovery time is slashed. It entails spending money 
on hardware and infrastructure. Uptime and recovery times are not guaranteed.
Figure 6. Linux box

72
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
Advantages of using Linux Box: The advantages of using Linux Box are as follows.
•	
Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that it is freely 
available and can be customized to meet the needs of businesses. This can 
result in lower costs and greater flexibility when compared to proprietary 
software.
•	
Linux is known for its stability and reliability, which can be important in 
backup and disaster recovery scenarios. It also has a reputation for being less 
vulnerable to viruses and malware than other operating systems.
•	
Linux is compatible with a wide range of backup solutions, including both 
proprietary and open-source options. This can provide businesses with 
greater flexibility when choosing a backup solution.
•	
In comparison to other options, the implementation cost is very low.
Disadvantages of using Linux Box: The disadvantages of using Linux Box are 
as follows.
•	
Linux box requires higher bandwidth than any other model.
•	
While Linux has a large and active community, it may not have the same level 
of commercial support as other operating systems. This can make it more 
difficult for businesses to find help if they encounter issues with their backup 
solution.
•	
Linux can be more complex and difficult to learn for users who are used 
to other operating systems, such as Windows or MacOS. This can result in 
a steeper learning curve for IT staff responsible for managing the backup 
solution.
•	
Data privacy is an issue with this model.
4.5 Efficient Routing Grounded on Taxonomy (ERGOT)
Giuseppe Pirro, Paolo Trunfio, Domenico Talia, Paolo Missierand Carole Goble’s 
Efficient Routing Grounded on Taxonomy (ERGOT) (Pirro, G., et al., 2008) is 
entirely focused on semantic analysis and does not prioritise time or implementation 
complexity. The core of this system is the semantics that makes service discovery 
in cloud computing possible. This method doesn’t function as a backup mechanism 
and, in addition, it offers a successful data retrieval that is entirely dependent on the 
semantic similarity between service descriptions and service requests. Additionally, 
it makes use of both fine- and coarse-grained service functionality definitions.
ERGOT works by first classifying data based on its importance, sensitivity, or 
other criteria. The data is then routed to the appropriate storage location based on its 

73
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
classification. For example, critical data may be routed to multiple geographically 
diverse locations, while less critical data may be stored in a single location or in a 
less expensive storage tier. The taxonomy used in ERGOT can be customized to meet 
the specific needs of the organization. For example, the taxonomy may be based 
on the type of data, such as customer data, financial data, or employee data. The 
taxonomy may also be based on the level of sensitivity, such as public, confidential, 
or highly confidential.
ERGOT is a technique used in cloud backup that involves organizing data based 
on a taxonomy and routing the data to the appropriate storage location. ERGOT can 
improve the efficiency, security, and disaster recovery capabilities of cloud backup, 
making it an attractive option for organizations looking to enhance their backup 
and storage capabilities.
There are three components to this concept. Those are:
i) 	
The utilization of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) protocol facilitates the 
propagation of semantic service descriptions that are annotated with individual 
ontology concepts.
ii) 	 With the help of a Semantic Overlay Network (SON), peers with similar 
semantically annotated service descriptions can be clustered together, and this 
network is built up gradually through service advertising via DHT.
iii) 	 A metric to determine the degree of semantic similarity between various service 
descriptions.
Unlike traditional backup solutions, the ERGOT strategy offers efficient data 
retrieval that depends on the semantic resemblance among service requests and 
descriptions, and it combines two network paradigms to provide semantically-driven 
query replies in DHT-based systems. Although ERGOT faces challenges with 
semantic similarity search models, it overcomes these limitations by generating 
a SON over a DHT. The system’s effectiveness in terms of search accuracy and 
network traffic was demonstrated after a thorough investigation of it under various 
network conditions. However, semantic similarity search models do not integrate 
well with DHT-based systems. They only run logarithmic performance-constrained 
exact-match searches.
Advantage of this approach: The advantages of using Efficient Routing Grounded 
on Taxonomy (ERGOT) are as follows.
•	
ERGOT reduces the amount of data that needs to be backed up by organizing 
it into taxonomy. This allows for more efficient use of storage resources and 
faster backup times.

74
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
•	
ERGOT is highly scalable and can be used to protect large amounts of data 
in the cloud. It can easily handle growing data volumes and provide high 
availability of data across different geographical locations.
•	
This technique utilizes both high-level descriptions of service functionality 
as well as more detailed descriptions.
•	
ERGOT can provide better data privacy in cloud storage backup by encrypting 
the data fragments before they are stored in the cloud. This ensures that even 
if the data is accessed by unauthorized users, they cannot read or use it.
Disadvantage of this approach: The disadvantages of using Efficient Routing 
Grounded on Taxonomy (ERGOT) are as follows.
•	
However, the semantic similarity search paradigm does not work well 
with DHT-based systems’ exact-match searches, which have logarithmic 
performance constraints.
•	
ERGOT requires a high degree of technical expertise and infrastructure to 
implement. The process of encoding and decoding data requires significant 
computational resources, which can be costly for small businesses or 
individuals.
•	
SONs must be connected to a limited number of peers since query efficiency 
improves with fewer peers that must be searched.
Figure 7. Efficient routing grounded on taxonomy

75
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
•	
ERGOT may not be compatible with all cloud storage platforms. This can 
limit the flexibility of businesses and individuals in choosing a suitable cloud 
storage solution.
5. PROPOSED TECHNIQUES FOR CLOUD BACKUP
We are proposing a novel method for cloud data backup that utilizes the tokenization 
and encryption capabilities of cloud service providers to enhance the security and 
privacy of user data. This approach involves converting data into digital tokens, 
which can be securely transferred and stored. The tokens can then be encrypted 
using advanced techniques such as AES or RSA encryption, adding an extra layer 
of protection to the backup process. This innovative solution has the potential to 
revolutionize the field of cloud data backup by providing users with greater confidence 
in the security of their data.
Once data is tokenized and encrypted, it can be securely stored on external 
devices such as hard disks or secure digital cards, which are often underutilized. To 
facilitate this storage process, members of the general public can contribute these 
devices and receive cryptocurrency as a token of appreciation for their valuable 
contribution. This innovative approach not only provides an extra layer of security 
for cloud data backup but also incentivizes individuals to participate in the storage 
process, ultimately reducing costs for cloud service providers. With this system, 
users can have peace of mind knowing that their data is being stored in a secure and 
cost-effective manner, while also contributing to the growth of the cryptocurrency 
market.
In order to be eligible for the cryptocurrency reward, users must store their 
data on their local machines and keep it available for retrieval by the cloud server. 
In the event that the cloud server experiences difficulties accessing its data, it can 
notify the file keeper and request their encrypted files. This innovative system not 
only provides users with a financial incentive to securely store their data, but it also 
offers an additional layer of protection for cloud servers in the event of data loss. By 
incentivizing secure data storage, this approach has the potential to revolutionize the 
field of cloud data backup and enhance the overall security of cloud storage systems.
With the increasing number of contributors joining the network, the usefulness of 
the cryptocurrency token is set to surge, thereby boosting the value of the currency. 
As a result, more people will be incentivized to contribute their underused storage 
resources, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both the cloud company and 
its users. This innovative approach provides a secure and cost-effective way to store 
and access data in the cloud, which is a win-win situation for all parties involved.

76
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
5.1 Model Description
The proposed model for cloud data backup involves several key features.
•	
Firstly, the data is tokenized and distributed in a decentralized manner. This 
distribution is closely monitored and regulated by the central authority of the 
cloud service provider. By distributing the tokenized data in a decentralized 
manner, the likelihood of data breaches and theft is significantly reduced.
•	
Secondly, cloud companies can control the distribution of the tokenized data 
based on various factors, such as an individual’s reputation, political and 
financial stability, internet connectivity, and government laws. Additionally, 
cloud companies can create a cryptographic currency token, which can be 
used to facilitate the exchange of data.
•	
To implement this model, cloud companies need to create an algorithm that 
can break user data into the smallest tokens and merge them using a powerful 
compression algorithm. The resulting file is then encrypted and sent to the 
contributor. To validate the transaction of data and distribute tokens, cloud 
companies can use the proof of work method.
•	
Moreover, cloud companies can store an encrypted ledger of the distribution 
of data within the contributor’s memory. Every user of this cloud would be 
given a unique hash number that identifies the ledger holder. From there, 
cloud companies can retrieve the user’s data.
•	
Finally, In the event of any unforeseen issues with a user’s data on the 
server, our proposed model provides a robust and effective solution. Cloud 
companies can simply request the data collector to provide their file with 
the encrypted ledger, which facilitates the exchange of our cryptographic 
currency and enables the stored data to be made available online once again. 
This streamlined process ensures that any issues with user data can be resolved 
quickly and efficiently, with minimal disruption to the user’s operations.
Overall, our proposed model offers a comprehensive and innovative solution 
to the challenges of cloud data backup. By leveraging the latest advancements in 
encryption and decentralization, we believe that our model represents a significant 
step forward in ensuring the privacy and security of user data in the cloud. Cloud 
companies that implement this model can offer their users a more reliable and 
secure backup process, which in turn can help to enhance their reputation and 
competitiveness in the marketplace.

77
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
5.2 Tracking the Data Distribution
Each time a cloud computing company rents data to a user, the company will also 
store an encrypted ledger of the distribution, indicating how and where one’s data 
has been distributed, within the contributor’s memory. Each user of this cloud service 
will be given a hash number that identifies the ledger holder, enabling retrieval of 
the user’s data. The system will be decentralized and immutable, like the crypto 
public ledger. The use of hashing and encryption will prevent data theft, and it will 
enable us to shortlist the file keepers to retrieve a specific individual user’s data.
5.3 Retrieving User’s Data
In the event that a cloud computing company experiences any issues with its users’ 
data on the server, the company may request that the data collector provide the 
stored files along with the ledger to restore the user’s data online. The request to 
share the data with the data collector will be sent 24 hours prior to the designated 
time for data retrieval. At that specific time, the company will initiate a process to 
retrieve the data. As an administrator, the data collector must grant permission to 
run the process. Once the process is complete, the system will return to its original 
state and the user’s data will be restored online.
Figure 8. Block diagram of proposed technique

78
Intelligent Data Retrieving Technique for Sustainable Cloud Computing
5.4 The Digital Transactions
Crypto transactions will be facilitated through the cloud company’s wallet. Users 
must create an account in the cloud company wallet to receive the crypto they earn. 
To exchange crypto for desired currency, third-party exchange services will be 
available. These exchange services will be directly linked to the cloud company’s 
wallet for seamless transactions, and users can receive the funds in their bank 
accounts through this process.
5.5 Advantage of this Technique
The advantages of using this technique are as follows:
•	
In this strategy, cloud service providers are spared the expense of purchasing 
additional servers to store the backup of the primary cloud server.
•	
Due to the near impossibility of finding all system nodes, even after decrypting 
the encrypted ledger, cloud computing companies need not worry about data 
breaches.
•	
This model is very cost efficient and almost self-financing.
•	
As this method is totally crowdsourced this model doesn’t need regular 
employee.
•	
As in this model the data is totally decentralized, it’ll not be affected by any 
natural or human-caused calamities.
•	
It is accurate to predict that an increase in the value of the crypto currency 
(reward) will exponentially increase the storage contributors and vice versa 
because the storage rental system is crypto-based.
5.6 Issues
•	
Though in this process data can easily be tampered with by the contributor, 
this model protects against data breach or theft. To prevent this, cloud 
companies must tokenize the data and then use the appropriate encryption.
•	
Cloud back up companies have to compress the tokens into a single file in that 
such a way by which user can decrypt and retrieve the data with ease and with 
proper information of parent of the tokens.
•	
This process is kind of time consuming as whenever the server needed to back 
up its data by these tokens, cloud companies have to wait for the contributor 
to upload their files to the server. (For solving this issue, cloud companies can 
encourage the contributor with giving them rewards on basis of how fast they 
upload the files to the server)

•	
As it is a crypto based rental system a drop in the crypto currency’s (reward) 
value can make the company lose the trust of its storage contributors.
•	
To make the reward consistent cloud companies might have to invest in the 
currency.
The proposed idea of using a crowdsourced, decentralized model for cloud backup 
has several advantages, such as being cost-efficient, self-financing, and resilient to 
natural disasters. However, there are also potential issues to consider, such as the 
need for tokenization and encryption to prevent data tampering, the time-consuming 
process of waiting for contributors to upload files, and the risk of losing the trust of 
storage contributors due to fluctuations in the value of the reward currency. These 
issues can be addressed through careful planning and investments, making this 
model a promising option for cloud backup.
6. CONCLUSION
All of these options for cloud data backup demonstrate that none of the current models 
can solve the aforementioned issues. Each alternative method has advantages and 
disadvantages that vary based on the circumstance. All of these methods attempted 
to address various problems while keeping the implementation costs as low as 
feasible. However, there are certain methods where the price rises gradually as the 
amount of data increases. As an illustration, take the Cold and Hot back-up method, 
which executes backup and recovery based on the detection of failure triggers. The 
model we have outlined, addresses the bulk of the issue in the most efficient and 
cost-effective manner, something no other model has been able to achieve. Not only 
that, but our model is self-financing, which means that cloud companies do not 
need to invest frequently in them in order to keep them operating; rather, after some 
time, our model will start to create its own revenue and will no longer require their 
support of cloud company. Only thing that Cloud Company will need to ensure is 
that our model is implemented properly and because of this, we think that among the 
alternatives, our data backup solution is the best. Even if our data backup strategy 
addresses the majority of the problems in this area, there is still a tonne of room for 
innovation and development. We are sure that the work we put into this initiative 
will open up new opportunities for the academic community to work on this model.

Enhancing Cloud Security
INTRODUCTION
In an era defined by the relentless growth of digital data and the pervasive adoption 
of cloud computing, the paramount concern of organizations is ensuring the security 
and integrity of their data and systems. The allure of cloud technology, with its 
promises of scalability, accessibility, and cost-efficiency, has revolutionized the 
way businesses operate and manage their information. However, this convenience 
is not without its perils. The ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats poses a 
continuous challenge, demanding innovative solutions that can adapt and fortify 
the defences guarding the cloud.Traditional security mechanisms, though effective 
to a certain extent, have been rendered insufficient in the face of increasingly 
sophisticated threats. The solution, it appears, lies at the intersection of technology 
and intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), driven 
by their capacity to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and make real-time 
decisions, have emerged as the vanguards of cloud security.From the evolution of 
cyber threats to the limitations of conventional security measures, we embark on a 
journey to unravel the transformative potential of AI and ML in safeguarding cloud 
environments. By scrutinizing real-world applications and addressing the challenges 
that lie ahead, we aim to equip both cybersecurity professionals and business leaders 
with the knowledge and insights needed to fortify their digital assets in an era where 
data is the most valuable currency. Join us as we navigate the complex terrain of 
cloud security and unveil the future, where intelligence meets technology to guard 
the gateways of the cloud.
THE EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE
In the realm of cyberspace, the threat landscape is in a perpetual state of evolution. This 
dynamic and ever-changing environment poses substantial challenges to organizations 
that rely on cloud computing to store and manage their data. Understanding the 
nature of this evolving threat landscape is crucial for comprehending the necessity 
of advanced security measures, particularly those driven by Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
1. 	
Increasingly Sophisticated Attack Techniques: Attackers in the digital realm 
have not only grown in numbers but have also upped their game in terms of 
sophistication. Gone are the days when simple viruses and malware were the 
primary concerns. Today, cybercriminals employ intricate and multifaceted 
techniques to infiltrate cloud environments. These methods are designed to 

87
Enhancing Cloud Security
circumvent traditional security measures, making them increasingly difficult 
to detect and prevent.
2. 	
Ransomware Attacks: Ransomware attacks have garnered significant attention 
in recent years due to their devastating impact. In a typical ransomware attack, 
malicious actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand a ransom for the 
decryption key. Such attacks not only result in immediate financial losses 
but can also lead to substantial downtime and data loss, severely affecting an 
organization’s operations and reputation.
3. 	
Data Breaches: Data breaches involve unauthorized access to sensitive 
information, which is then exfiltrated or exposed to unauthorized parties. The 
fallout from a data breach can be catastrophic, including financial penalties, loss 
of customer trust, and legal ramifications. The theft of personal and financial 
data has become a lucrative business for cybercriminals.
4. 	
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: DDoS attacks involve 
overwhelming a target system or network with a flood of traffic, rendering 
it inaccessible to legitimate users. These attacks have become not only more 
common but also more powerful and sophisticated, often involving the 
coordination of thousands of compromised devices. The motivation behind 
DDoS attacks varies, from financial extortion to ideological or political agendas.
5. 	
Reputation Damage: Beyond the immediate financial implications, these 
cyber threats can tarnish an organization’s reputation. News of a data breach 
or a successful ransomware attack can erode trust among customers, partners, 
and stakeholders. Rebuilding a damaged reputation can be a costly and time-
consuming endeavour.
6. 	
IoT Devices and Interconnectivity: The proliferation of Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices has further amplified the threat landscape. IoT devices, often 
with limited built-in security, can serve as entry points for attackers. Moreover, 
the increasing interconnectivity of systems means that vulnerabilities in one 
area of an organization’s infrastructure can potentially impact the security of 
the entire network. This expanded attack surface makes it more challenging 
for security professionals to identify and mitigate potential risks.
The evolving threat landscape in cyberspace is characterized by the increasing 
sophistication of attack techniques, the prevalence of ransomware and data 
breaches, the persistence of DDoS attacks, and the potential for significant financial 
and reputational damage. Additionally, the proliferation of IoT devices and the 
interconnected nature of systems have expanded the scope of security concerns. 
To combat these evolving threats effectively, organizations must adopt advanced 
security measures, including those harnessing the power of AI and ML, to stay one 
step ahead of cyber adversaries.

THE SYNERGY OF AI AND ML IN CLOUD SECURITY
The synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in cloud 
security represents a powerful and transformative approach to addressing the complex 
challenges posed by the modern threat landscape. These technologies offer a range 
of advantages that collectively enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of cloud 
security measures:
1. 	
Real-time Threat Detection:
◦◦
AI-driven systems have the capacity to process and analyze massive 
volumes of data in real-time. In cloud security, this capability is 
invaluable because it allows for the continuous monitoring of activities 
and events occurring within cloud environments.
◦◦
ML models, being data-driven, continuously learn and adapt to new 
information. This means that they can identify anomalies and potential 
threats as they emerge, often before they are formally recognized and 
documented as threats by security experts or databases.
◦◦
For example, if an AI system notices an unusual surge in login attempts 
from an unexpected location or device for a particular user account, it 
can flag this as a potential threat and take immediate action.
2. 	
Pattern Recognition:
◦◦
ML algorithms are adept at identifying patterns and trends within data. 
In the context of cloud security, this capability can be harnessed to 
detect deviations from normal behavior.
◦◦
Unusual user behavior, such as a sudden increase in data access or an 
unusual data transfer pattern, can be flagged as potentially suspicious 
by ML models.
◦◦
Unauthorized access attempts, even if they do not trigger traditional 
security rules, can be detected by AI systems that recognize patterns of 
behavior consistent with past attacks.
3. 	
Predictive Analysis:
◦◦
AI and ML can leverage historical data and ongoing observations to 
predict potential security breaches. By identifying patterns and trends 

91
Enhancing Cloud Security
that indicate an imminent threat, these technologies allow organizations 
to take preemptive action.
◦◦
For instance, if an AI system notices a series of unsuccessful login 
attempts followed by successful ones, it may predict that a brute-force 
attack is in progress and respond accordingly by increasing security 
measures.
4. 	
Behavioral Analysis:
◦◦
ML models can create detailed user and entity profiles based on historical 
data and ongoing behavior. These profiles allow for the detection of 
anomalous actions or deviations from established behavioral patterns.
◦◦
For instance, if a user typically accesses specific resources and suddenly 
attempts to access sensitive data outside their typical scope, an AI-
driven system can flag this as a potential insider threat or a compromised 
account.
5. 	
Adaptive Response:
◦◦
AI systems are not limited to detection; they can also take automated 
actions in response to security incidents. This capability is crucial for 
rapid threat mitigation.
◦◦
When a potential threat is identified, an AI system can isolate 
compromised resources, revoke access, or apply other remediation 
measures in real-time. This reduces the reliance on human intervention, 
saving critical time and reducing the window of opportunity for 
attackers.
The synergy of AI and ML in cloud security provides organizations with a 
dynamic and proactive defense mechanism against the evolving threat landscape. 
These technologies excel at real-time monitoring, pattern recognition, predictive 
analysis, behavioral profiling, and automated incident response. By leveraging these 
capabilities, organizations can significantly enhance their ability to detect, respond 
to, and mitigate security threats in cloud environments, ultimately strengthening 
their overall security posture.
THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES
Traditional security measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion 
detection systems, have played a crucial role in protecting cloud environments. 
However, they have their limitations:

security

93
Enhancing Cloud Security
1. 	
Signature-Based Detection: Signature-based detection is a cornerstone of 
many traditional security tools. This method involves identifying threats by 
comparing them to a database of known signatures or patterns of malicious 
code or behaviour. While effective in detecting known threats, it suffers from 
several limitations:
◦◦
Inability to Detect Zero-Day Attacks: Signature-based systems cannot 
identify threats that have never been encountered before, commonly 
referred to as zero-day attacks. Since they rely on historical data, they 
can’t recognize new and evolving threats.
◦◦
Signature Updates Delay: Even when new threats are discovered,

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
As computer networks are evolved with Internet of Things (IoT), which is the 
linkage of smart devices and home appliances with the internet, cybersecurity 
has become more essential because such systems are susceptible to many threats. 
Along with usefulness of internet it has also increased number of online treats, 
which can be credited to cybercriminals, hackers and even terrorist organization. 
Cyber-attacks have been ranked among the top five sources of global risk by the 
Global Risks Report of the World Economic Forum in 2019 (Taddeo et al., 2019). 
Figure 1 illustrates top Cybersecurity Threats,some forms of cybercrimes include 
cyber stalking, intellectual property theft, phishing, identity theft, email bombing, 
unauthorized access to data, system hack, server damage, spreading malware and 
computer viruses. Figure 1 illustrates top Cybersecurity threats.
According to reports and estimations, the damage from cyber attacks will add up 
to around $10.5 trillion yearly by 2025, which is a 300% rise if we compare it from 
2015 data (Morgan, 2022). Damage costs include data damage and destruction, theft 
of monetary assets, intellectual property loss of productivity, personal and financial 
data, as well as disruption of supply chains, business affairs and reputational damage. 
It has been causing unprecedented damage to private and public businesses, increasing 
the IT budgets of enterprises of all sizes, as well as governments and educational 
institutions on a global scale. It is therefore imperative to have defences against 
such threats, making Cybersecurity a top priority to ensure a secure digital space. 
Cybersecurity mechanisms should be able to process large quantities data, be fast, 
robust and intelligent enough to learn and adapt to the variety of malware being 
generated. This is the prime reason why organizations of both public and private 
sector are resolving to integrating AI based techniques to efficiently monitor and 

130

counter threats (Ansari et al., 2022). Artificial Intelligence help in defining patterns 
of any anomalous behaviour of any system or network. It can assist in internal 
threats such as unauthorized access or misuse of data. Estimates indicate that the 
market for AI in Cybersecurity will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 
billion net worth. Table 2 illustrates market size trends and predictions for AI in 
Cybersecurity to give an idea of the amount of money invested in it. The compound 
annual growth rate is estimated to be around 27.8% during 2022-2023 due to vast 
increase Cybersecurity threats. The compound annual growth rate is estimated to 
be around 27.8% during 2022-2023 due to vast increase Cybersecurity threats.

3. CONVENTIONAL TOOLS IN CYBERSECURITY 
AND THEIR LIMITATIONS
When coming to development and application of AI ways in Cyber Security, we 
first need to understand the traditional tools in Cybersecurity, which are as follows:
3.1 Cyber Kill Chain and ISA
A cyber kill chain refers to the various phases that a cyber-attack follows. The first 
phase is the reconnaissance phase in which the attacker will try to detect the flaws 
or vulnerabilities throughout the system where an attack can be launched. As a gap 
is detected a malicious code is prepared which is transferred to the identified target 
in the delivery phase. Upon a successful deployment of the malware to the target, 
it installs the malicious code in the system to corrupt either the entire system or 
parts of it. This is the exploit phase. As the host system is now corrupted, it is under 
the directive of the attacker who then uses the new developed directives to carry 
out malicious activities. Usually, Cybersecurity experts deploy countermeasures 
depending upon the cyber kill chain (Yadav & Rao, 2015; Wirkuttis & Klein, 2017). 
A comprehensive approach in Cybersecurity to handle such grouping is Integrated 
Security Approach (ISA). This approach locates the section where the attack was 
targeted upon and gathers relevant information about the threat to generate an alarm 
or a warning usually before the exploit phase so that the threat can be dealt with using 
countermeasures to prevent further escalation or at least understand the nature and 
extent of damage if the breach has already taken place. Cybersecurity experts try 
to include remedial actions to revert back the system to its original state (Wirkuttis 
& Klein, 2017). To ensure proper handling of threats, the ISA needs to consider 
every phase of the cyber kill chain and act accordingly-prevention by giving out 
early warnings and alerts, detection by looking out for attacked sites and quick and 
suitable response to the attack.
3.2 Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS)
A common tool for Cybersecurity is Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) 
which can be a software or hardware that responsible for working on a given data 
while processing and analysing it. It uses the two main methodologies: - i) Misuse 
detection that can scan patterns of an irregular system behaviour and detect some 
kind of malicious activity. ii) Anomaly detection that finds out any behaviour that can 
be characterized as an anomaly with respect to the normal system where the model 
was trained. These patterns are characterized based upon knowledge of previous 
threats that were experienced (Patel et al., 2012).

132

3.3 Limitations of Traditional Approaches in Cybersecurity
Rise of Sophisticated Attacks: In the recent years, security threats have become 
more variant and ever changing and even adapted to be able to bypass the safeguards 
kept place. While traditional methods to Cybersecurity problems are equipped to 
protect consumers against certain type of attacks, rise of sophisticated cyber attacks, 
such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) (Li, 2018) has challenged traditional 
security approaches. Such an attack does not have previous records and act as soon 
as a flaw in the system is detected. In a survey of about 4000 midsized companies, 
it was found that amount of threats have increased about twice from the year 2021 
to 2022 and that more than forty percent of the malware detected were never seen 
previously. Targeted and customized attacks have increased drastically ever since the 
covid-19 pandemic (Coro, 2022). The traditional approaches are thus shorthanded 
against such advanced threats. The prime objective of cyber security is to identify the 
indicators generated from a compromised system during the entirety of an ongoing 
attack. However this becomes a very difficult task as the system has to deal with bulk 
data being generated frequently in the expanding cyber world with so many devices 
getting connected. This also creates shortfall of Cybersecurity experts and subsequent 
high demand for the use of AI in Cybersecurity to facilitate the automation in a 
number of repetitive threat detection lessen the strain on Cybersecurity employees. 
Artificial intelligence is also capable enough to address these more proficiently as 
compared to other software-driven approaches.
Inferior Detection Rate and Reliability: Nature of cyber space is such that there 
is a lot of variation in the patterns of the network, thus patterns are identified and 
characterized inaccurately, this results in a low detection rate of the IDPS (Wirkuttis 
& Klein, 2017). The IDPS is also susceptible of wrongly identifying normal system 
behaviour as an anomaly and thus generating a false alarm. This causes much 
interruption in the usual proceedings and thus a security expert gets nvolved in 
finding the false detections instead of doing something more productive, leading 
to loss of time and resources. iii) Weak Processing Power and Low Automation: 
As the amount of data to be scanned is huge the IDPS are bounded to be slow is 
analysing the data (Apruzzese et al., 2023). This also makes them inefficient and 
unable to cope up with the variant nature of the digital canvas that is constantly 
expanding (Wirkuttis & Klein, 2017). Moreover, traditional measures also requires 
automation as there are cumbersome tasks like analysing large quantities of log data 
individually, readjustment of the system properties to cater to the changing network 
environment and resolving every individual warning messages.

4. AI APPROACHES TO CYBERSECURITY
4.1 Intelligent Agent Based Cybersecurity
These systems have Intelligent Agents that uses intelligent behaviours like sharing 
the knowledge gained among the entities, pro-activeness, and ability to categorize, 
quantify and respond so as to together find solutions to complex problems. The agents 
can be assumed as objects spread across the systems that are farsighted and able to 
communicate among themselves. Furthermore these agents are proactive and can 
notice any fluctuations or changes in the environment during any kind of Denial-of-
Service (DoS) attack which is a cyber attack interferes in the normal functioning of 
the services by disabling certain resources. In this way these decentralized agents 
come together to safeguard the system from DoS attacks, while cooperating and 
exchanging information among each other (Yadav & Rao, 2015). The two main 
advantages of such agents are: i) The agents are decentralized and spread across 
the system, they are able to gather complete data from various parts of the system 
to properly analyse and identify the threats. ii) As these agents are ‘intelligent’ 
they can gather experiences from the past attacks and adapt accordingly so as to 
be better prepared for future attacks. Thus these agents are capable enough in the 
surveillance and assist in various stages of the cyber kill chain. In the recent years, 
cyber security experts have been grouping the intelligent agents to form a ‘Cyber 
Police’ to effectively combat against security threats in a decentralized fashion. 
Such police has shown promise to be able identify the potential target system as 
well as attacks as early as possible. Although it should be noted that prior legal and 
industrial permissions must be attained before defining such police force in the 
cyber environment as well as partnership with the ISPs and other different tools 
available to ensure efficient working (Guarino, 2013). Experts are also employing 
different kinds of agents, mainly detection and counterattack agents. The first group 
scouts the system for potential abnormal behaviours and the second group pursues 
countermeasures based on the decentralized data it was shared by the detection agents. 
If you notice, this approach sort of models the human immune system (Patil, 2016).
Expert systems based are computer programs having refines hybrid tools that 
are assembled to assist in decision making in complex problems from various fields 
such as healthcare, business, research, technology sciences, etc. An expert system 
has two main components- the knowledge base and the inference engine. The former 
can be said to be a database in which information belonging to a particular domain 
is the stored and the inference engine is from which answers can be derived(Patil, 
2016) (Padron & Ojeda-Castro, 2017). In cyber security domain expert system can 
be applied with two approaches: i) Cased based reasoning (CBR) approach that 
considers the solutions of past experiences to tackle a new similar problem. The 

134
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
solutions are of course worked upon and enhanced as we encounter new problems in 
the system. ii) Rule based reasoning (RBR) that adheres to the guidelines declared 
by the expert system to first analyse then act according to the rules defined. This 
way they can help access in making decision regarding the threats in underlying 
system or whether they are infected in the first place. These AI based expert system 
have shown to be capable enough to be able to monitor large amounts of data across 
the different heterogeneous cyber landscapes on real time. Thus helping out the 
Cyber experts with the tedious task as well as generating early warning an alerts 
with accurate information about the nature o the threat (Patil, 2016; Tyugu, 2011).
4.2 Machine Learning in Cybersecurity
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that is heavily associated with computational 
statistics and therefore is centred on prediction making. It involves using mathematical 
optimization and procedures to define methods, theory and applications for a 
particular field. It focuses on interpreting, categorizing, regression and decision 
making as per the data it was trained on (Patil, 2016). One of the ML approach is 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which are primarily used to prevent malicious 
intrusion by integrating with all the stages of the ISAs and is capable of working 
under every phase of the cyber kill chain. They monitor the system and act upon 
detecting any intrusion right before the delivery phase, thus accomplishing the 
intended purpose of Cyber. Not only this, just like a human brain, they are able 
to add to their arsenal knowledge from previous attacks which is a big advantage 
over traditional Cybersecurity techniques (Tyugu, 2011). ANNs are first trained 
with the data of normal network properties to recognize and formulate patterns. 
As it monitors the existing network any new data packet introduced to the system 
is quickly analysed and compared with the pre learned patterns to determine if it 
is malicious or not, mismatches will be deemed malicious and thus rejected by the 
IDPS. This way ANN facilitates anomaly based IDPS approach as well as address a 
major concern in IDPS system which is false alarm. As the datasets are meticulously 
handled and compared, the chances of a false detection of a threat or intrusion are 
decreased greatly, while traditional IDPS approaches are only successful against 
intrusions that are already known, the ANNs integrated approach is also able to 
defend against unknown attacks (Buczak & Guven, 2015). The special feature of 
ANNs is its high speed helping security professionals with automatic defining of 
the patterns into infected or not, using its past lessons. Today ANNs are integrated 
across several system such as firewall, network hubs, etc to combat against threats 
like DoS, intrusion, computer worms, spam, viruses and malwares and monitoring 
network traffic (Bitter et al., 2010).

135
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
Another ML technique is Support Vector Machines (SVM),which employs 
‘boundary concept’ to segregate elements according to different class (Ghanem et 
al., 2017).In Cybersecurity, SVMs are primarily applied in intrusion detection system 
using four steps- The first one is Data Pre-processing where raw data is analysed 
and all trivial data found is taken out without any human assistance. SVMs can 
work on linearly, non linearly separable datasets by segregating the input vectors 
using a separation hyper plane. In case the datasets are not separable, it will use 
appropriate functions to map them in higher dimensional spaces so that they can be 
easily separated (Martínez Torres et al., 2019). The model mainly uses the concept 
of vectors and distances to train SVM model, performance of model is optimized 
so as to increase the accuracy of the model with the last stage being classification 
of the data according to the several attributes to determine the potential target class. 
SVMs have shown promise in determine potential threats and vulnerabilities for an 
intrusion using these steps, it can analyse Internet traffic patterns and separate them 
into their component classes thus help regulate traffic flow on internet (Abdiansah 
& Wardoyo, 2015).
A decision tree is also ML model which has a tree like structure with class labels 
such as leaves or nodes represent the object value which can be derived by the path 
from the root node to the leaf node (Raheja & Munjal, 2021). Decision tress is 
widely applied in achieving cybersecurity in number of ways including intrusion 
detection, where it is trained on past intrusions and learns to classify the incoming 
network traffic as ordinary or malicious form to cause an intrusion. As depicted in 
Figure 2 at each node, the attributes of the data that categorize the data elements into 
subsets as per the normalized information gain are selected. Decisions are made by 
the attribute with the highest normalized information (Xin et al., 2018). Decision 
tress is capable of automatically generating responsive safeguards which are trained 
to during its development (Abubakar et al., 2015). It also aids in anomaly detection 
because by constructing a decision tree from normal behaviour data, the model can 
detect deviations from the learned patterns to determine an anomalous behaviour 
of the system. It is also useful in classification of malware by understanding the 
file attributes and patterns of sample malicious files. Another application is misuse 
detection in which it compares the alleged misuse to the prescribed rules set before. 
The biggest advantage of this approach is its ability to implicitly extract attributes 
and their simpler interpretation. There are a few disadvantages of decision trees, 
which includes its limited capability to combat unknown intrusions, thus this 
approach requires regular updates with the newest intrusion and frequent training 
to combat against advanced treats. Another disadvantage is that while experts can 
effectively extract knowledge and rules from small trees by simply examining them, 
the process is much complicated when it comes to bigger trees. The deeper and 
wider a tree is, the less intuitive it becomes in extracting rules, hence decision tress 

136
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
are mostlyapplied in smaller sections of larger security systems (Buczak & Guven, 
2015; Raheja et al., 2021).
k- Nearest Neighbour k-NN is another ML method widely used to detect anomalies, 
the data is fed in to kNN model then it calculates the distance between elements 
across data points in the dataset and looks for the “k” closest data points (neighbours) 
in the feature space (Xin et al., 2018). This way the algorithms maps out the dataset 
and uses the distances to define patterns within it to train itself (Raheja & Munjal, 
2021). Different studies show that this method can provide promising results, with 
good detection rate and low false alarm rate. The special feature of this algorithm is 
the use of a general formula for distance calculation that makes it a very convenient 
approach. KNN techniques have immensely aided intrusion detection systems due to 
the ability of fast understanding of new traffic patterns. They are thus equipped to 
combat against Zero day attacks which can infect the system before countermeasures 
are prepared (Pallaprolu et al., 2017). KNN models have been implemented to combat 
against Botnets which are networks of compromised computers or devices controlled 
by a malicious entity, used for various illicit activities like DDoS (Distributed Denial 
of Service) attacks, spam distribution, and data theft without owners’ knowledge 
(Hoang & Nguyen, 2018). Security experts are also using this model for real-time 
threat detection and false-data injection. Since kNN calculates the distances among 
the instances of a dataset, thus its not very convenient to use it for larger datasets 
as they contains lots of different classes with numerous instances, hence they are 
Figure 2. Structure of decision tree

137
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
used in smaller sections in Cybersecurity systems (Abubakar et al., 2015; Raheja 
et al., 2021).
In Cybersecurity, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to detect anomalies in IDPS 
systems, GA studies existing patterns to gain more insight and predictability on 
future patterns it will encounter. This way an IDPS integrated with GA can ensure 
quick identification for of new anomaly (Calderon, 2019). GA is also used to 
improve firewalls to aid network defence using network traffic pattern. GA can also 
aid in cryptography as it can decipher encryptions (Pallaprolu et al., 2017). This 
also helps generating numerous configurations to aid in vulnerability assessment 
for network and systems. The special trait of GA is its adaptive nature, it can adapt 
to the evolving and dynamic nature of cyber environment and thus combat against 
new emerging threats without an extensive human supervision. This model suffers 
from high computational complexity thus demand more time and resources also it 
requires extensive experimentation may not always adequate and are influenced by 
a number of factors (Padron & Ojeda-Castro, 2017; Kang & Kang, 2016).
4.3 Deep Learning in Cybersecurity
Deep learning (DL) uses more advanced algorithms that make use of only relevant 
data or the progress in the system while linking old and new data to form and 
identify patterns. DL is different from ML as it can handle large amounts of data 
(both supervised and unsupervised. DL methods are also able to interpret an image 
by using the vector of every pixel intensity value, edges, various shapes present in 
an image for which requires better hardware and more expertise (Calderon, 2019).
Deep Belief Network (DBN) is an unsupervised DL approach that comprises 
of a interrelated covert layers, arranged in a hierarchical fashion. In Cybersecurity, 
DBN are integrated with the IDPS where it analyses the data, estimates the number 
of hidden layers required during computation. During training the layers are treated 
individually, as the model starts training on the dataset of that layer to identify 
patterns and performs calculations to determine the future conditions. After training, 
the output of one layer is treated as the input to the next layer. DBN can determine 
possible intrusions with high degree of accuracy as well as detect any false positive 
warnings generated in the IDPS. Another characteristic feature of this model is its 
ability to ‘self learn’ because of which minimal human assistance is required and the 
model has room to improve upon itself (Calderon, 2019). Owing to its self-learning 
nature, DBN have also been effective against novel and advanced security treats 
thus they can be employed to identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications, 
by analysing user input patterns and web server logs (Kang & Kang, 2016). The 
Cybersecurity systems and networks are of dynamic nature involving large datasets 
thus DBN models are adapted to give better results (Berman et al., 2019).

138
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
Another DL model is CNN that deals with data in the form of arrays so as to be 
able to handle structured grid like data and can represent its result in the form of two 
dimensional arrays (Calderon, 2019). It comprises of three layers, i) Convolution layer 
that is responsible in defining relationships among the data sets as per the weights 
(learnable parameters) of the input to produce a feature map, ii) pooling layer that 
interprets the feature map to extract relevant information and iii) Classification layer 
that is responsible for high level representation and classification of processed data. 
Detailed architecture is depicted in fig, where input is given in form of image and 
output attained inform of class label of that image.CNN are used for phishing attack 
by learning from features of a phishing mail or site and analyse the structure and 
visual elements to prevent potential phishing threats. Another application of CNN is 
in biometric authentication as it can deal with data in the form of 2D or 3D elements 
(Xin et al., 2018). CNNs are employed to break visual CAPTCHAs, which are used 
to prevent automated bots from accessing online services. CNNs process network 
traffic data and analyse packet headers or payload content to detect anomalies and 
signs of unauthorized access, intrusions, and cyber attacks (). The model is trained 
for dataset of known individuals to identify the vital patterns and carry out accurate 
authentication (Berman et al., 2019). Figure 3 illustrates the basic CNN architecture.
RNNs are advanced deep neural networks that use output of the hidden unit as 
input for the next additional input for next element, while processing one input at 
a time. It is best suited for tasks where the order and context of the data elements 
are essential for understanding and making predictions (Xin et al., 2018). RNN 
are capable of handling speech recognition, language translation and time series 
problems. RNNs are used widely in network traffic analysis by identifying unusual 
patterns or detect specific types of network attacks, such as DDoS attack. It provides 
Figure 3. Basic CNN architecture

139
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
real time analysis of network traffic data and log files to detect anomalies and 
potential cyber intrusions (Kim et al., 2016). RNNs being capable for time series 
analysis thus they are suitable for event logs and system metrics to study trends and 
anomalies. RNNs analyze system logs to identify sequences of events that could 
indicate security breaches or unauthorized activities. It can also help against phishing 
by analysing email content and detect phishing attempts based on the sequence of 
words or patterns used in phishing emails. RNNs also have the capability to study 
existing patterns and predict future patterns, thus being effective in dealing against 
new emerging intrusion with little or no past knowledge. RNN has thus proven to 
be an effective approach to address modern security challenges (Berman et al., 
2019; Gasmi et al., 2018).
Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) is a type of deep learning model 
in which two neural networks, one called the generator and the other called the 
discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator 
takes the input data and produces the output with same attributes of the original real 
data. The discriminator takes the output generated by the generator and real data 
and compares the two datasets. GANs are used in data augmentation by generating 
synthetic samples that closely resemble real data. Such augmentation of the dataset 
helps to improve the performance and robustness of machine learning models used in 
intrusion detection, malware classification, and other Cybersecurity tasks (Berman 
et al., 2019). GAN can generate a new and realistic data that resembles given training 
dataset. GANs have shown widely applicability in dealing with images and can be 
used in tasks like image generation and enhancement, hence it is useful in dealing 
with new Cybersecurity issues like deep fake video generation (Goodfellow et al., 
2014). GANs can create visual representations of complex Cybersecurity data thus 
aiding analysts in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in large datasets. GANs 
can analyse email content or web pages to identify phishing attempts or suspicious 
social engineering tactics based on patterns in text and images, thus helping in 
phishing detection (Tasneem et al., 2022).
5. ROLE OF NLP IN CYBERSECURITY
Natural Language Processing or NLP is an amalgamation of mathematical algorithms, 
statistics and linguistics within the sphere of AI. It helps machines contextualize 
nuances and sentimental analysis of the text, instead of just blindly following the 
rules of a language so that the machine can learn and adapt to new commands and 
protocols automatically. It also helps machine in text classification and extracting 
useful pieces of information gained from learning. NLP is used in speech recognition, 
user behaviour monitoring, threat analysis, phishing detection and identifies software 

140
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
vulnerabilities.NLP greatly helps in automating the task of detection of possible 
targets by developing a language model in accordance with the existing code and 
performing a rundown of the entire code to scan and pluck out the bugs or flaws in 
the system. The operational time is also much faster as NLP breaks down the codes 
and understands the relationship of the various elements with help of machine and 
deep learning models. They are useful in dealing with attacks that are identified but 
not no remedy has been found and referred to as Zero-Day attacks since it does not 
require the execution of code and can automatically remove the malicious entities 
present (Tyugu, 2011).
6. LIMITATIONS OF AI IN CYBERSECURITY
Like every piece of technology developed, there are few limitations of using AI in 
Cybersecurity.
Piracy Risk: The biggest concern of incorporating AI is the potential piracy 
risk. Big corporations and governments are concerned that the AI tools handling 
Cybersecurity have complete accesses to a large amount of data that may also contain 
sensitive or confidential data. There is a big lack of trust between them and the third 
party AI tools that they have borrowed (Ansari et al., 2022).
Requirement of human supervision: Despite their accuracy, AI tools are also 
susceptible of making errors and generative false alarms themselves. This cause 
time wastage of security professions who need to analyse the entire system. As AI 
models are complex, this cause much more difficulty in finding what the error is 
or where the error actually took place. AI systems may automate Cybersecurity but 
they still are not completely autonomous themselves and need human supervision.
Lack of morals: There are also moral issues regarding AI as they replace 
humans in various fields. These systems do not have any moral code of conduct. 
There is also a lack of legal laws and regulations surrounding AI which can be 
taken unlawful advantage of by notorious entities of the society. Hence standard 
certification procedures must be developed and carried out.
High Cost: As we have seen earlier the research and development of AI is very 
large and requires large investments from organization without any certainty of 
success. It also requires expert professionals. Both of these are not affordable for 
developing or poor countries.
Inability to detect threats: Cyber environment is a dynamic space which is 
constantly evolving. In the recent years cyber threats have grown more sophisticated 
and customized than ever. As such even with several advantages of AI in Cybersecurity, 
many a times they are unable to detect and defend against attacks which can result in 

141
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
severe losses. Furthermore, if AI models are fed even a miniscule amount of wrong 
input, they will result in drastic errors (Ansari et al., 2022; Apruzzese et al., 2023).
7. ETHICAL ISSUES OF AI USAGE IN CYBER SECURITY
7.1 Cyber Criminals Are Using AI to Disrupt Cybersecurity
A growing concern is that hackers and malicious groups may use AI itself to disrupt 
Cybersecurity. They may develop tools that evade all defection and swiftly attacks 
their targets. Hackers are able to deceive AI based systems and may even target the 
AI powered safeguards, thus corrupting them. They can manipulate the data AI model 
has to train on thus making them defective. Attacks on AI are also hard to detect 
as they have complex internal processes. Criminals can also reverse engineer he 
internal processes to understand why exactly he attacks could be determined (Taddeo 
et al., 2019). A system may show normal behaviour with certain manipulations to 
the neural network and the bug will only be activated with a trigger, this way AI 
is tricked into believing everything is alright. And the system will be corrupted in 
such a manner that it will show only miniscule changes even after the trigger until 
a fatal attack is carried out when it is already too late. Criminals are using AI to 
coordinate launch automated attacks, develop malware viruses, automated phishing 
and money laundering, formulate methods to breach safeguard as well as carry out 
new threats like deep fakes and password hacking.
The complicated structure of Cybersecurity measures makes it very difficult to 
spot the small differences which end up being decisive and enough of the attackers 
to do their malicious activities. For example, wearing an AI image recognition 
system can be tricked to wrongly categorize its subjects by wearing specially crafted 
eyeglasses (Taddeo et al., 2019). It is therefore is very important to make a robust 
and well versed AI system to defend against such growing concerns.
7.2 Human-AI Interfaces
With the growing challenges to Cybersecurity, and AI system being integrate in 
it, there is immense need for coordination between and trust between human-AI 
interfaces. At any level problems arise when individual system components maximize 
their own goals without considering the system level objectives. Moreover, in an 
era where misinformation and manipulation is rampant, good decision making 
requires hybrid approaches that leverage and orchestrate the unique human and AI 
capabilities and perspectives. The important areas to consider and work upon are 
good human machine teaming, trust building and assistance.

142
Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
The team up of human and machine needs to be such that humans are thorough 
and can easily explain the outcomes. The people working on such system should be 
able to identify goals, be active in decision making process and provide feedback 
that is worked upon with priority. Research is needed on how to minimize latency 
and negative consequences while providing stable output. In a diverse human-AI 
system environment, interactions must be managed with a goal to reduce human 
error, increase safety, and provide accountability (McDaniel et al., 2020).
8. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE THOUGHTS
This paper discussed how artificial intelligence is becoming an indispensable tool in 
Cybersecurity as the number of threats and their severity continue to grow. Traditional 
methods are not enough in this dynamic and fast changing cyber environment and 
how AI frameworks are being integrated in Cybersecurity. A lot of investment is 
done in this field and new techniques are being regularly formulated. Some of the 
approaches ML and DL approaches are discussed that act as tools to protect against 
threats. While AI is growing fast with a lot of potential, there still are a number of 
concerns surrounding their use in Cybersecurity which need to be addressed. The 
rapid advances in technology, new application domains, and the interplay between 
AI and Cybersecurity will continue to introduce new opportunities and challenges. 
As the IT sector is growing fast, so are cyber threats and thus more research and 
developments to be carried out to ensure a secure digital world.
Attention should also be given in fostering a reliable AI Cybersecurity System 
by investing in test beds and datasets to establish the AI community standards and 
metrics required to safely deploy future AI systems. Threat detection mechanisms must 
be tested and evaluated regularly. Possibilities include the creation and maintenance 
of realistic simulation environments and domain specific datasets. Test beds and 
datasets need to designed in such a way that the evaluation is in a in a structure, 
principled and sustainable manner. They should also have ground or reproducibility 
and be regularly revaluated across various domains. Ample educational opportunities 
should be provided to include fresh minds in this domain. The pros and cons of 
AI should be educated to the young minds at the institution level where disciplines 
of computer science, data science, engineering, and statistics intersect. AI based 
courses should be included as part of the accreditation process.
Priority should be given to defining standards of AI implementation and that 
the suppliers must develop and train their models in house. The testing data and 
knowledge gained must be evaluated the system owners who will use the tools. 
This will foster good connections between the concerned parties as well as access 
data and models. In addition to the actual system working to detect threats, a clone

system should run parallel as a control centre. The cone is not an exact duplicate 
of the original system neither an AI virtual simulation, rather a benchmark against 
which the behaviour of original system is evaluated. The divergence of actual and 
expected system behaviours help to address flaws and deficiencies early on, hence 
such parallel monitoring is encouraged.

ABSTRACT
Recently data sharing through the cloud is widely used and becoming a trend. But 
protecting data confidentiality and integrity is essential. Data confidentiality and 
integrity are maintained using cryptography. However, since it cannot ensure that 
the data hasn’t been altered, there is still a trust issue. The proxy re-encryption 
(PRE) technique was presented as a solution to this. It includes encrypting the data 
twice, allowing one to determine whether or not it has been altered. The PRE system 
is also prone to attacks that forge re-encryption keys. Here the data is encrypted 
twice so that the data can be checked whether it is modified or not. But the PRE 
system is prone to the abuse of re-encryption keys. Therefore, accountable proxy 
re-encryption (APRE) is proposed. Here, if the data is altered by proxy, the system 
will detect whether proxy is malicious or the delegator is trying to frame proxy as 
malicious. Also, the authors extend the algorithm and implemented base64 encoding 
and decoding. This prevents many passive cyber attacks.

Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
1. INTRODUCTION
IN today’s digital world, Data is a critical resource, and it is increasingly becoming 
more important in all aspects of our lives.Data sharing is also crucial in today’s 
interconnected world. By sharing data, we can collaborate and work together to solve 
complex problems and make better decisions. Cloud storage is the greatest choice any 
time a user wishes to share a data.The confidentiality of the data is the fundamental 
worry while sharing data on the cloud. The confidentiality and integrity of the data 
cannot be ensured by the content owner. Encryption of data is a crucial fix for this 
problem. For this reason, a variety of encryption techniques are available. The data 
is encrypted by the content owner (or delegator), who also distributes the decryption 
key to data consumers. For this to work, the content owner must be connected online 
at all times. To tackle this issue (Blaze et al., 1998) proposed Proxy Re-Encryption 
(PRE). Applying PRE in cloud, initially the delegator, proxy, and delegatee share 
all their public key certificates for authentication. The data is encrypted by the 
content owner (or delegator) and uploaded to the cloud. Using a re-encryption key, 
the proxy re-encrypts the ciphertext. The shared data is first encrypted, and then 
the ciphertext is sent to the proxy. The content owner produces a re-encryption key 
in response to a content receiver’s request and provides it to the proxy, who then 
re-encrypts the ciphertext and forwards it to the receiver.
But the proxy and content owner together has the ability to find the decryption 
key and can abuse the data. Also the data owner can frame a proxy as malicious.
So to ensure data security and to check if the delegator or proxy is malicious, 
(Guo et al., 2021) proposed Accountable Proxy Re-encryption(APRE). Here there 
will be a court module. Anyone can approach the court to verify it. The proxy with a 
delegatee can modify the data or the delegator can accuse the proxy is accountable. 
To identify it, the court module is used. The court module uses a judge algorithm. 
The algorithm gets the initial ciphertext and then it asks the proxy and the delegator 
to decrypt it. By observing the plaintext the court module will find whether the 
proxy or delegator is accountable.
The APRE scheme does not capture all the attacks. There will be many attacks 
over network, which will lead to Chosen Plain Text (CPA)/Chosen Cyber CCA. This 
can result in serious loss to the data owner. Hence, to extend the security further, 
our system used base64 encoding and decoding.
2. RELATED WORKS
Other than proxy re-encryption techniques (Sun et al., 2018) presented a revocable 
identity-based encryption scheme with cloud-aided ciphertext evolution. In order 

149
Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
to protect against chosen ciphertext attacks and avoid the fabrication of genuine 
ciphertexts or signatures, they devised a method revocable identity-based encryption 
(RIBE) scheme utilising ciphertext evolution.
As a security paradigm, to overcome the fact that in a traditional PRE scheme, 
a semi-trusted proxy can convert all ciphertexts for a delegator to ciphertexts for a 
delegatee once the proxy obtains the relevant re-encryption key from the delegator 
(Zeng and Choo, 2018) suggested sender-specified Proxy Re-encryption (SS-PRE) 
technique, which permits the assignment of decryption privileges for particular 
ciphertexts. The scheme is mainly for access methods tools. With improved computing 
efficiency, SS-PRE is protected from many attacks.
In order to prevent the misuse of proxy re-encryption keys, (Liu et al., 2019) 
suggested an accountable proxy re-encryption technique for transferring encrypted 
content among various users. Performance testing has demonstrated the usefulness 
of this approach. Here, the keys are safely encrypted while transferring for safety.
Cloud computing Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) method proposed by (Li et 
al., 2019) for lowering storage and processing costs for users and the Proxy Cloud 
Service Provider (PCSP). Under the presumption of decision q-parallel bilinear 
Diffie-Hellman exponent, the scheme is secured (BDHE).
The Variable and Multi-Keyword Searchable Attribute-Based Encryption 
(VMKS-ABE) technique for cloud storage was introduced by (Wang et al., 2019). 
It is resistant to adaptive keyword and selective plaintext assaults. It handles number 
of computational functions and it can reduce work load for end-users side.
The content is safely transferred. In a set of broadcast re-encrypted 
ciphertexts,(Wang et al., 2019) suggested a method for receivers privacy. When 
compared to previous broadcasting systems and current privacy-preserving schemes, 
our scheme takes less time to decrypt.
With the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, (Li et al., 2019) 
suggested an effective Proxy Re-encryption (PRE) technique, lowering user-side 
overhead and providing flexible data exchange. The method is effective in terms of 
computational cost and complexity and safe against the adaptive replay able selected 
ciphertext attack (RCCA) in complete ICN encryption.
In order to secure communication between fog-to-things computing, (Khashan, 
2020) presented a system that combines lightweight symmetric and asymmetric 
algorithms, with very efficient computational cost for re-encryption procedures 
carried out by fog nodes. Revocable Identity-Based Broadcast Proxy Re-encryption 
(RIB-BPRE), a security concept developed by (Ge et al., 2021) addresses the 
problem of key revocation. A proxy in RIB-BPRE has the ability to remove a group 
of delegates from the re-encryption key that have been chosen by the delegator. 
Performance analysis shows that the suggested plan is effective and workable. It 
analayses the security for the model. Accountability Proxy Re-encryption (APRE), 

150
Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
which employs a judge algorithm to identify potential misuse of decryption keys, 
was developed by (Guo et al., 2021). Data integrity for data shared on proxy servers 
is guaranteed by the APRE scheme. It ensures integrity of data. To allow authorised 
users access to data, (Agyekum et al., 2022) devised proxy encryption using identity-
based encryption. Using this technique, cached content is effectively delivered to 
Internet of Things devices.
3. PROPOSED MODEL
Data is the most valuable resource in our daily lives, and it is crucial to ensure its 
confidentiality and integrity. However, when data owners share their data through 
the cloud, there is often a trust issue, as they cannot determine whether the shared 
data has been altered. To address this concern, Guo et al. proposed the Accountable 
Proxy Re-Encryption (APRE) scheme [1]. A fresh approach was introduced by 
the APRE plan to address the trust problem, in which a judge can determine guilt 
based on a convincing piece of evidence presented. Therefore, if a proxy distributes 
a decryption device while conspiring with any delegatee, the judge algorithm can 
identify the malicious proxy, and the proxy runs the risk of being discovered and 
held liable. Nevertheless, this existing system is vulnerable to many network attacks 
that may capture ciphertext passed over the internet and attempt to decrypt it by 
collecting multiple ciphertexts. Thus, we propose a new system that can tackle such 
network attacks.
A public key is initially generated for the proxy, data owner, and consumer, and 
is subsequently shared to all parties for authentication. Following the creation of the 
content owner’s secret key, the plaintext is then encrypted by the delegator using 
the consumer’s public key to generate the first-level ciphertext. The content owner 
then creates a re-encryption key using their secret key, the proxy’s public key, and 
their own public key. To avoid obtaining the secret key and to stop harmful proxy 
behavior, the re-encryption key must be designed properly.
During the data sharing stage, as shown in Figure 1, the delegator encrypts the 
plaintext with the public key of the consumer, resulting in the first-level ciphertext. 
Both the first-level ciphertext and the re-encryption key are transmitted to the proxy. 
The proxy then utilizes the re-encryption key and its secret key to re-encrypt the 
first-level ciphertext. When the consumer requests access to the file, the proxy 
provides the content receiver with the re-encrypted cipher. The receiver decrypts 
the re-encrypted cipher using their secret key and obtains the original plaintext.
The content owner creates the second-level ciphertext by encrypting the plaintext 
with their own public key during the accountability phase, as depicted in Figure 2. 
The owner then performs a second-level decryption of the second-level ciphertext.

153

Following that, the judge algorithm creates a ciphertext that is once more decrypted 
at the secondary level. When the two second-level decrypted communications are 
compared, it can be inferred that the proxy is acting maliciously if they are similar.
The flowchart of the proposed model is in Figure 3.
Re-encryption key abuse attacks are not prevented by an APRE scheme, but it 
does create a deterrent to the malicious party. In terms of the structure, our basic 
concept is to give the delegator and proxy various “decryption capabilities.” That 
is, only one of them can achieve the desired decryption outcomes for specific 
erratic ciphertexts. We can identify if the proxy or the delegator is acting with bad 
intentions by using a decryption device to analyze specific ciphertexts. To make 
this work, we need to design the re-encryption key and the ciphertexts with a lot 
of attention to detail.
Nowadays there is lot of attacks happening over the network. Many passive attacks 
like sniffing are now possible. This will listen to the traffic silently and observe all 
the packets. This is very crucial in cryptography. When large numbers of ciphertexts 
are obtained by a attacker, then using many cryptanalysis tools the attacker can obtain 
the secret key. Once the secret is obtained by the attacker then there will be a huge 
loss. To prevent this many algorithms are used. One of the algorithms is base64 
encoding and decoding. The base64 encoding and decoding is mainly used while 
the data is transferred over network or some communication channels. Base64 can 
be used to encode sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, before 
sending it over the network. This can prevent attackers from intercepting and stealing 
the data in transit. Base64 can be used to obfuscate code, making it more difficult 
for attackers to understand. While transmitting the re-encryption key and ciphertext 
to the cloud, attackers might steal it use it for obtaining secret key. This method 
will prevent this from attackers. Our scheme also gives protection against passive 
attacks that happen over network. Some of the attacks are man-in-the-middle attack, 
Eavesdropping, Spying, Packet sniffing, Footprinting, Traffic analysis.
4. PRELIMINARIES
Given that r is the generator of the group P, and that R and RT are two cyclic groups 
with prime orders of P higher than or equal to 2, where P denotes the degree of 
security, a mapping function named e: R×R→RT is said to be bilinear when it meets 
the requirements listed below :
The first requirement, e: R×R→RT to be a bilinear map is that for any values of 
u, v, a, and b that belong to certain groups, e(ua,vb) must be equal to e(u,v)ab.
Another condition is that e must be non-degenerate, which means that if R is 
generated by r, then RT must be generated by e(r,r).

154
Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
Lastly, e must be able to be computed efficiently, which is another condition for 
it to be considered a bilinear map.
5. DEFINITIONS AND SECURITY MODEL
We define a security parameter𝜆 in our work to signify the degree of security. We 
present a PRE scheme made up of several algorithms, such as:
Initialize (𝜆): The public parameter value, which is choosen as random, is 
produced by this procedure after the security parameter is supplied.
ProxySet (value): The public and secret key pair for the proxy are created by 
this process and are designated as pkp and skp, respectively.
KeyGeneration (value): The secret and public key pair for a user, represented 
as skx and pkx, respectively, are generated by this process.
ReKeyGeneration (skx,pky,pkp): Using the secret key skx, of the content owner, 
the public key pky of the consumer, and the public key pkp of the proxy, this procedure 
creates a re-encryption key, denoted as rkx→y.
Encryption1 (pky,m): Using a content owner’s public key pky and a message, this 
algorithm generates a ciphertext, designated as Zy. This must not be re-encrypted
Encryption2 (pkx,m): Using a content receiver’s public key pkx and a message, 
this algorithm generates another ciphertext, designated as Zx. This ciphertext must 
be re-encrypted.
ReEncryption (rkx→y,skpZx): Using a re-encryption key rkx→y, the cloud server’s 
secret key skp, and a ciphertext Zx, this technique creates a re-encrypted ciphertext, 
indicated as Zy.
Decryption1 (sky,Zy): From a secret key sky and either a ciphertext Zy or a 
ciphertext that has been re-encrypted Zy as inputs, this technique generates a message.
Decryption2 (skx,Zx): This procedure takes a secret key skx, ciphertext Zx and 
creates a message.

Base64 Encoding (Zx): This algorithm encodes a ciphertext Zx passed for re-
encryption using Base64 encoding, converting it into binary and repeating 24-bit 
groups until the entire sequence of original data bytes is encoded.
Base 64 Decoding (Dx): This algorithm decodes an encoded ciphertext passed 
for re-encryption, discarding any extra padding characters used in the encoder.
The condition of correctness is that given any values of the proxy key pair 
(pkp,skp) obtained from ProxySet(value), any user key pairs (pkx,skx) and (pky,sky) 

155
Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
obtained from KeyGeneration(value), any re-encryption key rkx→y obtained from 
ReKeyGeneration(skx,pky,pkp), and any content from the plaintext space, the following 
conditions are satisfied:
Decryption1(sky), Encryption1(pky,m)=m; 
Decryption2(skx), Encryption2(pkx,m)=m; 
Decryption1(sky), ReEncryption(rkx→y,skp, Encryption2(pkx,m)=m
6. CONSTRUCTION
An overview of the system and its underlying presumption is given in this section. 
Re-encryption keys are used in the system, and it’s crucial to closely link them to 
the proxy in order to spot malicious activity. The judging algorithm will not be able 
to identify the proxy if it can generate an encryption key that is unrelated to itself. 
The re-encryption key must also stay private to prevent malicious delegations from 
framing the proxy. To act as a part of the cloud server’s public key, the re-encryption 
key was developed. Only certain access to the decryption device can the creator of 
the device be identified and the guilty party ascertained. The ciphertext should be 
designed to reach different conclusions for the content owner and the proxy with 
a content receiver so that the judge can identify the author of the ciphertext by 
carefully examining the output of the decryption device.
Setup(𝝀): Assume λ is the parameter based on security and we have two groups 
R and RT of prime order p, where p is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power 
of λ. We also have a bilinear map e:R×R→RT. To initialize the system, we randomly 
select four elements from group R: g1, g2, h1, and h2. We then calculate L as the 
result of evaluating e on h1 and h2. These values represent the system parameters.
value= (g1, g2, h1, h2, L) 	
ProxySet(value): To generate the proxy key pair, select a random value z from 
the set of integers {0,1,2,...,p-1} and calculate K=g2. Assign K as the public key 
pkp and z as the secret key skp.
KeyGeneration(value):To generate the key pair, select two random values xi 
and yi from the set of integers {0,1,2,...,p-1}. Compute Xi= hxx
1  and Yi= g yx
1 . Set 
(Xi,Yi) as the public key pki and (xi,yi) as the secret key ski.

8. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The outputs from the decryption1 and decryption2 are obtained. The decryption1 
gives the plain text to the data consumer. And the decryption2 produces an output 
when the cipher text from the encryption1 is given as input. The judge algorithm 
produces a cipher text which will be sent to decryption2 for several number of times. 
The output will be matched with the output of decryption2 obtained by the input 
of encryption1 cipher text.
This output shows the encryption module. The plain text to cipher text conversion 
is shown. The first encryption takes plaintext and data owner’s public key as input 
and generates za, zb, zc. Together za, zb, zc combined to form the first level cipher 
text. The second encryption takes plaintext and data consumer’s public key as input 
and generates za, zb, zc, zd. Together the four values combined to form second level 
ciphertext. The output values generated is shown in Figure 4.
This output shows the decryption module. The decryption1 produces the plaintext 
for the data owner and the decryption2 value produces a value which will be used 
in judge algorithm.
Figure 6. Shows the scenario where the proxy is malicious. The judge algorithm 
will run for several times. After a certain number of times if the output matches, 
then the judge algorithm shows that proxy is malicious.
Figure 7. Shows the scenario where the delegator is trying to frame proxy is 
malicious. The judge algorithm will run for several times. After a certain number 
of times if the output not matches then the judge algorithm shows that delegator is 
framing proxy. It proves the proxy is innocent and the delegate is malicious.

Accountable Malicious Entity Detection Using Re-Encryption Mechanism 
We originally formalised the idea of Accountable PRE (APRE), where the judge 
algorithm can identify the proxy that misuses its re-encryption key. Then, to stop 
cyber risks, we added base64 encoding/decoding. Additionally, it is decisional 
Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) secure and responsible under the premise of the Chosen 
Plaintext Attack (CPA). When compared to earlier analogous systems, ours provides 
superior performances.

ABSTRACT
Cloud computing has profoundly changed the face of data management for enterprises, 
providing increased scalability, ease of access, and cost savings. Nonetheless, this 
change has highlighted the crucial need for strengthened security measures to protect 
sensitive data from the ever-changing spectrum of cyber threats. Following the 
cloud’s rise as a storehouse for large datasets, the quest for sophisticated security 
solutions has gained traction. This motivation has resulted in the incorporation 
of artificial intelligence (AI) into the cloud security architecture. As cloud storage 
becomes increasingly popular, organizations are becoming more concerned about 
data security. Sensitive data is transmitted, ranging from messages and images to 
financial and health information. As technology advances, there is a growing threat 
to customer data in the cloud, making greater cloud security more important than 
ever. This study aims to give a comprehensive insight into the role of AI in data 
storage and transmission security in the cloud.

Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
1. INTRODUCTION
We live in the big data age, with organizations producing, collecting, and storing 
huge amounts of data on a daily basis, ranging from extremely sensitive business or 
personal customer data is being replaced with less sensitive data, such as behavioral 
and analytics for marketing. Aside from the growing amount of data that businesses 
must be able to collect, handle, and analyze, organizations are embracing cloud 
services. The traditional network barrier is fast eroding, and security teams are 
realizing that enterprises must reevaluate existing and past methods of cloud data 
security. With data and apps no longer living in your data center and more workers 
working far away from a physical office than ever before, Organizations must figure 
out how to safeguard data and control access to it as it moves across and through 
various contexts (Ganne, 2022). The three main pillars of data are Data confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability. These three broad pillars, sometimes known as the CIA 
triad, define the basic ideas that constitute the foundation of a robust, successful 
security infrastructure—or any organization’s security program. Any type of attack, 
vulnerability, or other security issue will almost certainly break one (or more) of 
these principles. This is why security experts employ this approach to assess possible 
threats to an organization’s data assets. Cloud data security safeguards data stored 
in the cloud (at rest) or going in and out of the cloud (in motion) from security 
risks such as unauthorized use, fraud, and manipulation. There is usage of physical 
security, technical instruments, access management and controls, and organizational 
regulations. Securing cloud data entails developing ways to safeguard important 
digital assets and information from potential security breaches, inadvertent errors, and 
hazards posed by personnel inside an organization. This entails using technological 
tools, established standards, and operational approaches to protect data confidentiality 
while allowing authorized access in cloud-based environments. The benefits of cloud 
computing include a variety of benefits such as the ability to retrieve data from any 
internet-connected device, lowering the risk of data loss during outages or events, 
and boosting scalability and agility. At the same time, many organizations are still 
hesitant to shift sensitive data to the cloud because they are unsure of their security 
alternatives and how to fulfill legal requirements. (Kumar,2019; Wagh,2020). 
Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a collection of security 
precautions designed to protect cloud-based apps, infrastructure, and data. User and 
device identification, data and resource access control, and data privacy are among 
the precautions. They also help with regulatory data accuracy. Cloud security is 
applied in cloud settings to protect a company’s data against DDoS attacks, viruses, 
hackers, and unauthorized access or consumption. There are three main types of 
cloud environments as mentioned in figure 1 below (Agarwal,2019);

196
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
•	
Public Cloud - Third-party cloud providers that host public cloud services. 
These services handle full backend administration, removing the need for 
businesses to build their own cloud infrastructure. Clients often use web 
browsers to access to these providers’ web-based solutions. Maintaining 
security in public cloud settings requires ensuring safe entrance, maintaining 
user identities, and validating accesss.
•	
Private Cloud - Private clouds frequently have stronger security standards than 
public clouds. This increased security is related to their exclusive attention to 
certain user groups or people, leveraging the organization’s or user’s security 
procedures. The intrinsic isolation of these cloud configurations functions as 
a precaution against external attacks due to accessibility that is restricted to 
a single entity.
•	
Hybrid Cloud - The expanding scalability of public clouds is combined with 
the better resource management of private clouds in hybrid clouds. These 
cloud setups connect many settings, including both private and public clouds, 
allowing for smooth expansion as requirements arise. A well-executed 
hybrid cloud configuration enables users to browse all of their environments 
effortlessly via a unified content management system.
The need of strong cloud security cannot be stressed as cloud computing becomes 
more incorporated into the operations of multiple enterprises. Gartner’s forecast of a 
23.1% increase in the worldwide public cloud services market during 2021 exemplifies 
this trend, underlining the growing acceptance of these solutions. While cloud usage 
is increasing, some IT professionals are still hesitant to fully migrate their data and 
apps to the cloud. This reluctance stems from worries about security, governance, 
and compliance, all of which are exacerbated when sensitive data is housed in cloud 
settings. The concern is about the possible vulnerability of important company

information and intellectual property as a result of unintentional disclosures or more 
sophisticated cyberattacks. To avoid breaches and unauthorized access, critical assets 
such as client orders, private design blueprints, and financial information require 
strict cloud protection. Protecting against data breaches and theft is critical not just for 
maintaining consumer confidence, but also for preserving the intellectual advantages 
that drive competitiveness. The ability of cloud security measures to strengthen data 
and precious assets appears as a vital aspect in the route toward cloud integration. It 
is a critical concern for any organization moving to cloud-based operations. (Tahir et 
al.,2021). Artificial intelligence (AI) has lately become a hot issue in the news and 
social media, as technical advances have made AI more powerful and accessible than 
ever before. AI experts think that unified solutions will substantially influence the 
cloud security sector. Given the importance of data security, AI may be utilized to 
alter cloud security and protect data stored in the cloud. MarketsandMarkets predicts 
that the global AI in cybersecurity market will expand at a CAGR of 23.3% from 
$8.8 billion in 2020 to $38.2 billion by 2026 (Siriwardhana et al.,2021). According 
to Statista, the average global expense for a data breach in 2022 will be $4.35 million 
USD. In terms of cloud breaches, public cloud breaches are more expensive than 
hybrid cloud breaches. Enterprises with advanced cloud security solutions paid less 
for data breaches than enterprises with early-stage maturity. This is most likely due 
to the fact that more advanced security detects and prevents breaches considerably 
faster than less advanced protection. A well-known German mobile communications 
subsidiary experienced its second data breach of 2023 in May 2023, when a breach 
disclosed the PINs, complete names, and phone numbers of over 800 clients, marking 
the company’s ninth data breach since 2018 (Zolfaghari,2022). Organizations are 
often searching for methods to simplify processes, create more accurate forecasts 
and insights, and make more informed choices in order to increase income. That is 
exactly what artificial intelligence claims to achieve. The capacity of AI to replicate 
the behavior of actual people, preferably a large number of them, is frequently used 
to streamline corporate decisions and procedures. This simulation is what makes AI 
“intelligent,” and it adds to the numerous ways in which AI is employed in business, 
notably in data utilization, customer management, and marketing AI is rapidly 
being used in cloud security because it may help organizations avoid cyberattacks, 
enhance incident response, and secure sensitive data from unauthorized access. 
Many organizations and security professionals are looking to AI to help them 
defend against cyberattacks since AI can analyze data in the cloud and discover 
trends to detect possible threats, as well as automate security operations like identity 
verification, access control, and data encryption (Alhayani,2021). AI may also secure 
data in transit by identifying malicious activity and acting quickly, automating the 
response process to security issues, and designing stronger security rules. AI may 
also analyze cloud data to identify possible vulnerabilities, follow down harmful

activity, and take relevant action. AI is gaining traction in cloud security due to its 
enormous potential to transform the cloud security business (Salih,2021). A recent 
study in Forbes revealed that AI’s promise in cloud technology throws a long and 
fascinating shadow. AI has matured into a faithful companion for those immersed in 
the cloud world, ushering in a domain of greater efficiency and scalability. It adeptly 
addresses repetitive or easily categorized chores, increasing our present capacities and 
promoting improved skills and deliberate choices. Businesses can access a practically 
endless pool of resources to train AI models, analyze massive datasets, and extract 
meaningful insights by utilizing the cloud. The scalability of the cloud means that 
AI applications can manage a wide range of workloads, from small-scale testing 
to large-scale production deployments, without incurring prohibitive infrastructure 
expenses. Furthermore, AI is becoming democratized, since it is now available in 
a variety of organization-ready services. This enables organizations of all sizes to 
grasp the potential of AI while also leveling the playing field for innovation. For 
example, accessibility and flexibility enable teams to interact seamlessly across 
countries, allowing developers to swiftly deploy AI applications without having to 
worry about underlying infrastructure maintenance (Sayegh,2023). There are several 
advantages of employing AI in cloud security. AI may assist in identifying risks that 
people may overlook, as well as providing insights into attacker behaviors. AI may 
also be used to detect and respond to issues automatically. Azure Sentinel, which 
is part of the Microsoft Azure cloud suite, is one example of this. This technology 
enables incident responders to execute security remediation automatically based 
on the kind of alarm given by a sentinel. This means that the system can detect and 
correct problems without the need for human interaction. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
is progressively outsourcing duties to automated technologies as it evolves. This is 
done to free up the AI’s time for more difficult activities or jobs requiring human 
judgment. This trend has various advantages, including enhanced efficiency and 
precision. There are, however, certain hazards, such as the possibility of job loss 
when more and more jobs are transferred to automated systems (Brathwaite,2019).
1.1 The Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in the Cloud
Data is the lifeblood of every organization. The adoption of cloud-based Software as a 
Service (SaaS) platforms, such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce, 
has skyrocketed in recent years. This growth is mostly driven by the need for increased 
productivity among remote employees and greater team cooperation. As a result, a 
significant amount of data is stored in the cloud on a regular basis. However, like 
with traditional hardware-based storage spaces, it is critical to remember that the 
cloud is not immune to data loss issues. According to HIPAA Journal research, 70% 

199
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
of firms had data breaches in the public cloud in the previous year. With growing 
worries about data breaches, cyberattacks, industrial espionage, and the introduction 
of severe data privacy rules, the use of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technology has 
become a critical requirement for modern enterprises. (Hillmann,2019). Data loss 
may be disastrous for enterprises of any size. Unfortunately, no business is immune 
to data loss. Every 11 seconds, a company will be the victim of a cyberattack in 
2021. Businesses are concerned about more than just external threats. As per to 
the Verizon 2021 Data Breach Reports Report, insiders were engaged in more than 
20% of security breaches. Data loss may have an influence on your company’s 
financial health. The global average cost of a data breach grew from $3.86 million 
to $4.24 million in 2021, according to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021. 
In addition to financial fines, data loss can result in lost productivity, money, and 
clients. One of the long-term effects of data loss is that it might ruin your company’s 
brand. As a result, implementing a data loss prevention plan is crucial for protecting 
corporate data, protecting intellectual property, and remaining in compliance with 
regulations. DLP solutions ensure that confidential/classified data in your organization 
is not lost, mistreated, or accessed by unauthorized personnel (Sarker et al.,2021). 
Data loss prevention (DLP) implies the process of protecting organizations from 
both data loss and data leakage. Data loss is described as the loss of critical firm 
data, such as that caused by a ransomware attack. Data loss prevention has to do 
with protecting data from being transmitted outside the bounds of an organization 
(Grispos,2019). DLP is an essential tool for companies of all sizes. DLP may help 
organizations protect their data from a variety of threats and ensure compliance 
with data security regulations. DLP may be used to secure data in cloud-based apps, 
databases, and storage systems. DLP is widely used in organizations to safeguard 
personally identifiable data (PII) and to ensure compliance with every pertinent 
requirement, in large organizations while achieving visualization of data in Bring 
Your Own Device (BYOD) environments, secure mobile workforces, and enforcing 
security and data security on distant cloud systems. The three most common reasons 
for data leaks are discussed below.;
•	
Insider threats: A hostile insider or attacker possessing access to a secured 
user account tries to transport data outside the organization by abusing their 
privileges.
•	
Extrusion by attackers: Numerous cyber-attacks target sensitive data. To 
get access to sensitive data, attackers penetrate the security perimeter using 
strategies such as phishing, malware, and code injection.
•	
Unintentional Data Exposure: A lot of data breaches occur as a consequence 
of employees leaving sensitive data exposed, giving data with open Internet 
access, or failing to limit access in compliance with organizational standards.

200
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
DLP integrated with AI and ML finds business-critical data better and quicker 
than older systems. Because this DLP is also self-learning, it requires significantly 
less involvement from IT Teams, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities 
rather than continually responding to false alarms produced by their DLP solution. 
DLP systems may use ML to locate and safeguard sensitive data, such as customer 
PII or PHI, across your cloud apps, APIs, and broader infrastructure. It will start by 
configuring the DLP system with a few rules so it understands what to look for and 
how to respond. The DLP’s machine learning component then allows the system to 
learn and probe fresh data, resulting in the automated redaction of sensitive material. 
Furthermore, machine learning may be applied to user behavior, allowing your 
DLP system to respond to unsafe or anomalous user behavior by redacting or even 
preventing users from submitting specific bits of information (Adithya,2022). DLP 
becomes self-learning with AI. Even when no hard and fast policy has been adopted, 
it uses past logs, rules, and pattern recognition to detect sensitive data. Furthermore, 
in the case of an insider attack, AI-driven DLP’s user behavior analysis capabilities 
imply that DLP may prevent a leak or breach in real time while simultaneously 
assisting end-users in improving their data security understanding (Ge,2022). As 
data becomes more scattered and hosted in the cloud, data management, and security 
practices are rapidly developing. AI can analyze regular user behavior and data 
access patterns to find abnormalities that might signal a data breach or unauthorized 
access. It may detect atypical login times, locations, and access patterns, assisting 
in the prevention of data loss due to unauthorized users. DLP systems driven by AI 
can scan and monitor data at rest, in transit, and in use inside the cloud environment. 
These systems can identify and block behaviors such as unauthorized data sharing, 
copying, or downloading. (Laurent,2023). Cloud-based data includes Software as 
a Service (SaaS) solutions, application hosting, data storage via platforms such as 
S3, GCP, or Azure, collaboration tools such as Slack, Trello, and Asana, webmail 
services such as Office 365 and G Suite, and video conferencing tools such as Zoom, 
Google Meet, and Teams. The difficulty stems from the fact that these cloud services 
handle large amounts of sensitive data. Employees access this data from a variety 
of places and devices, both personal and work-related, and it is also shared for the 
purposes of productivity and cooperation. When attempting to trace the disposition 
of data and its access by numerous parties, the complexity grows. Consider the 
following scenario: a single contract exists in 30 duplicates dispersed over 5 unique 
data sources in 15 locations. This case highlights the need for Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP) observations and suggestions. These include identifying data sources, detecting 
possible risks and vulnerabilities, resolving security gaps, prioritizing essential actions, 
and providing correction alternatives. As the system absorbs insights from inputs 
and results, the efficacy and precision of these measurements may improve over 
time. (Stone,2023). The synergy between encryption and AI-driven key management

Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
emerges as a strong guardian of sensitive information in the field of data protection, 
particularly within the complicated landscapes of cloud environments. Encryption, 
a dependable approach, protects data integrity and secrecy with complex algorithms 
and encryption keys. However, AI provides a harmonizing conductor for the 
orchestration of these keys, a delicate endeavor made more difficult by the dynamic 
nature of cloud data. Within these virtual corridors, AI demonstrates its expertise by 
assisting in various critical aspects of encryption and key management. Under AI’s 
watchful scrutiny, the cryptic process of key creation transforms into a skill of art 
and science. AI algorithms, equipped with a grasp of several parameters, generate 
encryption keys that are naturally resistant to brute-force attacks. Furthermore, AI 
orchestrates the secure distribution of these keys, ensuring that only those with legal 
ownership participate in the cryptographic symphony. The concept of key rotation, 
a paragon of proactive security, finds its beat in the attentive rhythm of AI. AI’s 
automatic hands flawlessly arrange the choreography of timely key movements, an 
effort to mitigate any breaches. This ensures that the ever-changing symphony of 
encryption keys stays elusive to malicious attackers (Fowers et al.,2018). AI examines 
user trends and their ventures into the encrypted domain. If the AI sentry detects 
an unusual overture - an unauthorized attempt to enter the encrypted realms - it 
sounds the alert, stopping the would-be intruder in their tracks. The threat of lost or 
compromised keys looms large in the fabric of data security. In this case, AI serves 
as a restorer, a digital maestro who uses complex algorithms to revive lost keys 
from the ashes of forgetfulness or malice. To emphasize its relevance, AI’s domain 
includes compliance and auditing. A scrupulously preserved record of encryption 
key-related actions is a symbol of commitment to security standards and defence 
against regulatory audit skepticism.Data can be examined at super-fast rates using 
AI and machine learning while remaining as accurate as if done by a person. Not to 
mention error-free results as a result. Managing dispersed and unstructured data is 
a natural specialization. They need to evaluate as much data as possible to enhance 
AI. The more information they gather, the more precise and efficient the solution 
will be. The security staff is frequently required to revise policies and guidelines 
on a weekly basis, which keeps them on edge and their data at danger. DLP, on 
the other hand, becomes self-learning thanks to AI. This program detects sensitive 
data by analysing prior logs, rules, and trends, even when no rigid standards are in 
place. Furthermore, AI-driven DLP can detect and prevent insider threats in real-
time, while simultaneously raising end-user awareness about data security through 
comprehensive user behaviour analysis (Srikanth,2022).

1.2 AI-Enhanced Behavioral Analysis for Robust Data 
Storage and Transmission Security in Cloud Environments
Malicious strikes all have one trait: they all behave differently from typical everyday 
behavior within a system or network. Companies can frequently detect malicious 
behavior by using signatures that are closely tied to specific sorts of well-known 
attacks. However, as attackers get more adept, they create new tactics, methods, and 
procedures (TTPs) that allow them to not only infiltrate weak settings but also move 
laterally unnoticed. This is where behavioral analysis comes into play. Security 
experts may now employ behavioral-based tools, algorithms, and AI to establish 
what the typical behavior of daily users is - and what it is not - with the support of 
enormous amounts of unfiltered endpoint data. Behavioral analysis may discover 
current and historical occurrences, trends, and patterns that are outside the bounds 
of common norms (Zhao,2013). The fast expansion of software and information 
technology over the last two decades has had a huge impact on the environment we 
live in and how we interact with it. Engineers have discovered a way to preserve 
data on how users interact with software, down to how the user moves their mouse. 
These facts would be useless on their own. However, advancements in analytics 
capabilities, especially with respect to, have allowed large amounts of user data to 
be analyzed for findings in recent years. Behavioral analytics is the process of 
analyzing massive amounts of user data in this manner (Kumari,2020). The basic 
mechanism in which AI turns out to be a true friend to the cloud is that AI systems 
commence by learning the typical behaviours of a given cloud environment. They 
examine data transmission, user interaction, application use, and network traffic 
trends over time. By doing so, they set a “normal” behaviour baseline for diverse 
organizations in the cloud ecosystem. After establishing a baseline, AI-powered 
systems continually monitor ongoing activity. They compare real-time behaviours 
to the previously learned baseline and mark any departures as anomalies. These 
anomalies might indicate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, malware activity, 
or other types of cyber risks. Artificial intelligence-powered behaviour analysis 
transcends simple rule-based techniques. It uses advanced pattern recognition 
techniques, such as machine learning algorithms and neural networks, to detect 
complex and subtle abnormalities that might elude standard security measures. AI 
systems function in real-time, giving businesses quick insight into possible dangers. 
Because of this proactive monitoring, attackers have a smaller window of possibility 
to exploit vulnerabilities. Cloud environments may be extremely dynamic, with 
fluctuating workloads and infrastructure. AI-powered systems can easily grow to 
manage massive volumes of data while also adapting to the changing cloud landscape. 
This versatility is essential for providing constant security coverage (Zhang,2016). 
Behavioral data is mostly collected through interactions between humans and software 

203
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
or computers. Uploading data to a website or choosing a product on a website are 
two examples of interactions. These events are kept in databases on a device or, 
more typically, on corporate servers with date and time stamps in a readily accessible 
format. The global datasphere will contain approximately 160 zettabytes by 2025 
(Hammoud,2020). By analyzing past data connected to data transmission and access 
in the cloud, AI systems can build baseline behavior patterns. These benchmarks 
define what constitutes “normal” behavior. As data travels across the cloud 
environment, AI compares current behavior to these baselines in real-time. When 
deviations occur, such as odd surges in data transfers or unauthorized access attempts, 
AI may immediately raise alarms to investigate further (Alipour,2015). As data 
traverses the complex environment of the cloud, AI compares the current behavior 
to the set baselines in real time. This attentive monitoring of real-time behaviors 
versus past standards enables AI to detect departures from expected patterns quickly. 
These aberrations might appear as odd spikes in data transfers, erratic access attempts, 
or any other activity that deviates dramatically from the established norms 
(Pacheco,2018). When such abnormalities are detected, the AI system plays a critical 
role in generating quick alarms. These alerts are an important technique for alerting 
security staff to potential dangers or security breaches that require further investigation. 
AI aids in the timely discovery of security concerns by rapidly raising these alarms, 
allowing organizations to take proactive actions to control and neutralize possible 
threats before they grow into severe crises (Rani et.al.,2021). AI can identify 
irregularities in user behavior that may suggest a security compromise. For example, 
if a person suddenly begins accessing files that they do not normally access or logs 
in from an unexpected place, this might indicate a compromised account. AI can 
detect these irregularities and warn the security team to further probe. Also, we can 
understand the concept of AI in behavior analysis through an example as in assuming 
a cloud-based e-commerce platform using AI-powered behavior analysis for security. 
The system has discovered that the web server receives a continuous stream of HTTP 
requests from diverse areas during regular operation. It suddenly observes a big rise 
in requests from a certain IP address in a short period of time, greatly above the 
normal pace. The AI system might identify this as a potential Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) assault and take mitigation steps, such as rerouting traffic or applying 
rate limitation.AI may also assist in more complex circumstances, such as identifying 
insider threats, in which a legitimate user may be operating maliciously by accessing 
sensitive data or undertaking unauthorized actions (Muralidhara,2017). As 
organizations use AI to strengthen their security procedures, it’s critical to strike a 
careful balance between protecting sensitive data and utilizing advanced analytical 
approaches. The beauty of these systems is their ability to protect user privacy 
through a sophisticated approach: instead of focusing on individual activities, they 
emphasize the study of aggregated trends. As a result, AI-powered security systems 

204
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
may detect irregularities and possible risks without interfering with individual users’ 
actions. This method not only reduces the possibility of privacy violations but also 
conforms to legal frameworks and compliance norms. As a result, organizations 
may capitalize on AI’s capabilities while adhering to their commitment to data 
privacy and regulatory mandates, ensuring their stakeholders that security is enhanced 
without jeopardizing individual privacy rights (Turjman,2021). Machine learning 
algorithms are used by AI-based phishing detection solutions to analyse the content 
and structure of emails in order to identify probable phishing attempts. These 
algorithms may recognize trends and abnormalities that suggest a phishing assault 
by learning from massive volumes of data. AI-based systems may also analyse user 
behaviour while engaging with emails in order to detect possible phishing assaults. 
For example, if a user clicks on a suspicious link or inputs personal information in 
response to a phishing email, AI-based solutions may detect this behaviour and 
notify security professionals (Moisset,2023). Darktrace, a major cybersecurity 
startup, uses AI and machine learning to analyse cloud behaviour. Their “Enterprise 
Immune System” uses artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the typical 
behaviour of a network, user, or device. It then detects deviations from this baseline, 
which might indicate possible dangers. Darktrace’s AI engine assisted a multinational 
insurance business in the early detection of a ransomware assault in its cloud 
infrastructure. Because the AI system detected anomalous patterns of data access 
and transfer, the security team was able to act before the assault could completely 
unfold, averting a significant data breach. Another befitting example is Azure 
Sentinel, Microsoft’s cloud-native security information and event management 
(SIEM) system, which uses AI to identify and respond to attacks. It scans cloud 
environments for unusual behaviour and patterns across several data sources. A 
retail firm using Azure Sentinel saw anomalous surges in network traffic emanating 
from a single IP address in one prominent occurrence. The artificial intelligence-
powered system recognized this as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assault 
and automatically deployed countermeasures to minimize the danger, maintaining 
uninterrupted service. (Armitage,2022; Ceponis,2021).
1.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Enabled User Authentication Data 
Transmission and Security: Protecting Cloud Environment
User authentication validates an individual’s identity while attempting to access a 
network or computer resource. It entails approving credentials transferred during 
network connections, so certifying the authenticity of the user’s contact with the 
system. The authentication procedure guarantees that only authorized users may 
enter a system, thereby prohibiting unauthorized users from inflicting harm, stealing 
information, or causing other types of disturbance. Almost all human-to-computer 

205
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
interactions need user authentication, with the exception of circumstances requiring 
guest or automated logins. It gives users access to networked and internet-connected 
technologies and services via wired and wireless networks. The three essential 
factors for user authentication are described below (Chang,2011; Choudhury,2011);
•	
Knowledge Factor - The knowledge components include all of the information 
that users must be aware of in order to commence a login procedure and get 
access to a system. This category includes usernames, IDs, passwords, and 
personal identification numbers (PINs).
•	
Possession Factor - All of the items required for users to complete a login 
are included in the possession criteria. This category includes products such 
as one-time password tokens, key fobs, mobile apps, and employee identity 
cards.

Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
•	
Inherence Factor - Individuals’ intrinsic characteristics that demonstrate their 
identity are known as heredity factors. Biometrics in this area include retina 
scans, fingerprint scans, facial recognition, and voice security.
SFA is the process of confirming a user using only one piece of information, 
generally a password. Because SFA relies on a single element, such as password 
knowledge, it is unable to prevent unauthorized access if an attacker obtains the 
user’s password. Multifactor authentication (MFA), on the other hand, makes 
use of various authentication techniques to authenticate a user’s identity. A user, 
for instance, it may be asked to provide a password as well as correctly answer a 
security question. Two-factor authentication (2FA) combines components from 
two types of authentications, whereas four-factor authentication (4FA) combines 
elements from all four types of authentications. The latter technique is substantially 
stronger in terms of defending against unauthorized access because to the higher 
levels of protection given by increasing factors (Dasgupta,2017; Lal,2016). Large 
volumes of sensitive and confidential data belonging to persons, organizations, and 
consumers are stored in noisy surroundings. Proper user authentication guarantees 
that only authorized users have access to this information, lowering the risk of data 
breaches and unauthorized access. The primary approach for restricting access to 
cloud resources is user authentication. It guarantees that users only have access to 
the data and services to which they are entitled, preventing either inadvertent or 
purposeful misuse. Data protection legislation and compliance requirements are 
strict in many businesses and areas. Adherence to these requirements is aided by 
proper authentication procedures, which ensure that data access is allowed only 
to authorized personnel (Alizadeh,2016). AI is becoming increasingly important 
in information security since such technologies are capable of swiftly analysing 
millions of data sets and identifying a wide range of cyber risks, from virus threats 
to suspicious behaviour that might lead to a phishing attack. One of the numerous 
advantages and applications of artificial intelligence is cybersecurity. With the fast 
growth of cyberattacks and the increasing number of gadgets, artificial intelligence 
and machine learning can help stay up with cyber criminals by automating threat 
assessment and response more quickly than traditional software-driven or manual 
operations (Ciolacu,2018). Behavioral biometrics is one way AI is revolutionizing 
authentication. To establish a unique user profile, behavioral biometrics analyze 
trends in human behavior such as typing speed, mouse movement, and touchscreen 
interactions. To authenticate the user’s identity, AI systems may analyze this data 
in real-time and compare it to the user’s known behavior. This method offers an 
extra degree of protection since it is difficult for attackers to effectively duplicate an 
individual’s distinctive behavior. A further field where AI is making considerable 
progress in authentication is facial recognition. Deep learning algorithms are used in 

207
Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
AI-powered facial recognition systems to analyze facial traits and produce a biometric 
template. To authenticate the user’s identity, these templates are matched to their 
recorded face data. Facial recognition is a non-intrusive and convenient verification 
method that may be used for a variety of purposes, including unlocking cell phones 
and gaining access to protected facilities (Sharma,2022). Adaptive authentication 
uses artificial intelligence to continually analyze the risk associated with a user’s 
login attempt based on a variety of criteria such as location, device, time of day, 
and behavior. The system then modifies the amount of authentication necessary. 
If a user attempts to log in from an unknown area, for example, the system may 
request additional authentication procedures. Adaptive authentication is a flexible 
and adaptive method of authenticating users based on the context of their login 
attempt, improving security while reducing user friction (Akram,2022). Multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) Optimization entails employing artificial intelligence (AI) to 
intelligently adapt the authentication procedure based on the perceived risk of the 
circumstance. In practice, this implies that when a user tries to access the cloud from 
a known and trusted device or location, the authentication process may be reduced to 
only one factor - often a password. This simplified procedure guarantees a pleasant 
user experience while ensuring security. This optimization contributes to achieving 
a balance between security and usability. When utilizing trusted devices, users may 
enjoy a seamless experience while being prompted for further authentication when 
the system detects possible risks. This dynamic modification improves security while 
simultaneously adapting to the changing threat landscape. As AI systems learn from 
patterns and anomalies, their ability to effectively assess risk and alter authentication 
methods improves over time, resulting in a more intelligent and responsive security 
solution. (Kavitha,2021). NLP-driven authentication approaches make use of AI’s 
ability to analyze and interpret human language, enabling more complex and context-
aware verification procedures. NLP allows systems to comprehend the context of 
a communication. For example, if a user attempts to access private financial data, 
the system may request extra authentication elements to validate the user’s identity 
before giving access. It can modify their replies in response to the user’s reactions. 
If the user is hesitant or confused, the system may require additional authentication 
procedures for verification. (Baclic,2020; Sun,2020).AI is playing a critical role in 
the development of more secure authentication systems. AI is adding additional 
levels of security to existing authentication systems through behavioral biometrics, 
facial recognition, voice recognition, anomaly detection, continuous authentication, 
and adaptive authentication. These artificial intelligence-powered authentication 
solutions enable more accuracy, simplicity, and flexibility to new security risks, 
making them a crucial component of current authentication systems.

Data Storage and Transmission Security in the Cloud
CONCLUSION
The future of artificial intelligence in cloud computing is quite intriguing. We are 
on the cusp of making some significant advances in this field, owing to the rapid 
advancement of ML technologies and the growing affordability of computer power 
in cloud computing, which will allow us to handle data quicker and more effectively 
than ever before. It also assists us in detecting patterns and linkages that might 
otherwise go undetected. This will have a significant influence on industries such as 
medical, banking, and logistics. In the realm of medicine, for example, AI is frequently 
employed in medication research and development to aid in the discovery of novel 
medicines that will also assist us in better understanding and forecasting human 
behavior. AI will also help us better understand and predict human behavior. This 
will help with website and app accessibility, as well as marketing and advertising. 
Overall, the prospect of AI in cloud computing appears to be bright.

ABSTRACT
With a majority of the human population on the internet, online activity has become 
the order of the day. And that is why the internet is where criminals of every hue 
and color join forces and innovate in innovative ways. Not all “lands” have laws 
to deal with cybersecurity and privacy. Criminals across the globe have exploited 
the gap between technology and laws. The Indian Constitution recognizes privacy 
as a fundamental right, albeit with certain restrictions. Governments, in the name 
of providing secure cyberspace, infringe upon the privacy rights of citizens. And 
surveillance in India is chiefly governed by the Indian Telegraph Act u/s 5, which 
permits the government and its agencies to surveil provided a qualifying prerequisite 
preexists. Various surveillance apparatuses have been established by the GoI. 
Allegedly, the surveillance regime poses a grave threat and a chilling effect on 
privacy and freedom of expression rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution. 
This chapter discusses cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance regimes in Indian 
cyberspace.

Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
1. INTRODUCTION
As of July 2023, 5.19 billion people (64.6 percent of the world’s population) were 
active internet users, making up more than half of the global population, according to 
a Statista report. A whopping 4.88 billion of these Internet users make use of social 
media platforms (Petrosyan, 2023). These numbers suggest that social, political, and 
economic activities are bound to occur in the cyberspace. With an overwhelming 
majority of the world’s population regularly using the Internet, cyberspace exhibits 
all the characteristics of Homo sapiens, including participation in unlawful and 
unethical practices like breach of privacy.
Experts believe that the abrupt withdrawal of ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes from 
circulation on November 8, 2016, at midnight, prompted an increase in electronic 
transactions, which is why cybercrimes have skyrocketed in post-demonetization India 
(Table 4). Many residents who lacked computer literacy were forced to use electronic 
means of payment, which exposed cyberquacks (NCRB, 2019). The media began 
to pay attention to news about cybercrimes and related concerns about invasions of 
privacy and the electronic surveillance regime in mid-July 2021. This was due to 
an investigative story on Pegasus Project published by The Wire, which was based 
on the findings of a global consortium of 17 media groups. The Wire published an 
investigative story on Pegasus Project based on the findings of a consortium of 17 
media groups spread across the globe (Varadarajan, 2021).
Understanding the cyberspace ecosystem is necessary for securing it. 
This ecosystem consists of following main components: (1) the internet and 
telecommunications infrastructure, which is measured by the number of phone 
and mobile connections, the number of internet users, the amount of e-commerce, 
and social media users in the nation; (2) the regulatory framework that governs 
the operations of the cyberspace, such as electronic communications, digital 
signature certificates, and e-commerce transactions; (3) guaranteeing the safety of 
cyber-citizens while they carry out their everyday tasks in cyberspace, fostering 
confidence in the country’s cyberinfrastructure, and putting in place an emergency 
response system to handle cyber-threats; (4) offering a thriving, robust, and resilient 
cyberspace ecosystem for conducting economic activities; (5) creation of a strong 
and technologically advanced cyber-legal environment for the purpose of making 
citizens feel safe, criminals feel scared and uneasy, and governments feel honest and 
reluctant to spy on their innocent citizens; (6) a well-prepared society and armed 
forces to defend its territory in any conflict-like situation in the fifth dimension, 
or cyberwarfare; and (7) most importantly, preparing its society and citizenry for 
living a peaceful and contented life in the cyberspace by raising digital literacy levels 
to the point where a sizable portion of the population can work, understand, and 
produce content for the consumption of others in the cyberspace (Chhibbar, 2020).

215
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
The laws and regulations and directives issued (under the laws) by the government 
to regulate cyberspace comprise the regulatory framework for cyberspace. The 
twin matters of cyberspace security and digital privacy in India is governed by the 
Information Technology Act of 2000 and Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 
2023. Right to privacy, in general, is protected by Constitution of India as well. The 
Indian Supreme Court has interpreted the Indian Constitution in a way that makes 
the right to privacy for citizens fundamental, even though it is subject to certain 
restrictions. Cyberspace privacy violations are getting more frequent, simpler to 
carry out, and can have catastrophic consequences. Cyber-surveillance of targeted 
individuals and large groups by public and corporate organisations is another facet 
of cyberspace. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, u/s. 5(2) and Rule 419(A), notified 
under this act, govern surveillance in India.
This chapter covers these two closely related aspects of cyberspace, namely, 
cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance in the Indian cyberspace. Next section 
and its subsections are devoted to security concerning Indian cyberspace. Privacy 
aspects of citizen’s rights in cyberspace and relevant law has been discussed Section 
3 and cyber-surveillance regime in India has been discussed in Section 4, wherein 
subsection 4.3 has covered various aspects of Pegasus Project.
2. CYBERSPACE ECOSYSTEM IN INDIA
Looking back, we can see that India’s cyberspace began to take shape in 1976 
when the National Informatics Centre (NIC) began offering information technology 
solutions to the government. With the establishment of the NICNET, a wide area 
network (WAN) by NIC with nodes at each district head office nationwide, in 1987, 
the Indian cyberspace saw even more growth. NIC used to leverage very small 
aperture terminal (VSAT) technology to offer email and Internet services during 
the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1986, the Department of Electronics launched the 
Education and Research NETwork (ERNET) with funding from the United Nations 
Development Programme. ERNET supplied University Libraries with Internet and 
domain services based on both TCP/IP and OSI protocol stacks for approximately 
ten years. Later, TCP/IP was used for all internet traffic, and OSI was no longer 
used or supported. After the US government withdrew control over ARPANET 
in 1989–1990, the Internet quickly expanded outside of the US. Fueled further by 
the advent of smartphones, availability of cellular mobile phone technology in the 
latter half of the 20th century, and the sharp decline in Internet data prices in the 
latter half of the 21st century, the number of Internet users and traffic volumes in 
India saw an exponential rise. These developments have given rise to the creation 
of huge Indian cyberspace with the globally largest number of social media users 

216
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
and a very big e-Commerce marketplace (Chhibbar, 2020). Following subsection 
discusses the key components comprising Indian cyberspace ecosystem:
2.1 Cyberspace Infrastructure
The cyberspace infrastructure includes internet penetration in the society in terms 
of mobile subscribers, internet users, social media users, e-commerce users; and 
bandwidth, quality, and cost-to-user of the Internet. Table 1 shows the teledensity 
in rural and urban India in terms of absolute numbers and percentage subscribers.
India has 692 million Internet users, 467 million social media users, and 1170.75 
billion (more than 117 crores) mobile subscriber customers as of January 2023 - 
see Table 2 (DataReportal, 2023). The primary cause of the rise in Internet and 
social media users may be traced to the shift in enterprises, education, consulting, 
and socialisation activities—such as alumni meetups, weddings, and consolation 
meetings—to online platforms following the Covid-19 pandemic’s travel limitations.
2.1.1 Cyberspace Regulatory Framework
It consists of legislative artifacts such as cyberlaws and privacy laws, and statutes 
and regulatory guidelines issued by government for controlling cyberspace. It also 
encompass the initiatives and strategies adopted by the government to encourage

public and private investment for development of safe, seamless, and ubiquitous 
cyber-infrastructure; unbiased and open policies for the distribution of spectrum; 
opening cyberspace to emerging technologies; creating a system for controlling fake 
news and illicit cyber-activity; and signing bilateral and multilateral cooperation 
treaties with other nations.
The extent of security of its cybercitizens and cyber-infrastructure, and readiness 
and quickness of its cyber-emergency response system define an amicable cyberspace. 
The creation of cybersecurity strategies, the establishment of a reliable emergency 
response system, and the provision of cybersecurity training to those in charge of 
managing, upkeep, and security of vital information infrastructures in the public and 
commercial sectors—namely, finance, telecommunications, transportation, power, 
defence, and nuclear—are all necessary to provide a secure ecosystem.
As many as thirty six central organisations are in place in India to protect its 
cyberspace paraphernalia. In addition, India was one of the first few nations to 
establish a National Cyber Security Policy, but not much has changed in the field of 
digital security since the policy’s introduction in 2013. The Ministry of Home Affairs, 
Government of India, outlined the steps to strengthen the nation’s cybersecurity in 
December 2018 in light of the fact that more and more common Indian citizens—read 
non-techies—are using electronic services for financial transactions since the country 
saw a demonetization in November 2016. Sensing a little success of 2013 policy 
and ascension of new challenges like cloud services, use of artificial intelligence 
in foiling the security measures, and general data protection requirements as per 
global standards, a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2023 (Draft) has been drafted 
and circulated to replace the 2013 Cyber Security Policy (Singh & Malik, 2021). 
Indian cybersecurity comprises the following elements:
•	
National Security Council of India
•	
National Information Board
•	
The Information Technology Act, 2000 amended in 2008
•	
National Cyber Security Policy, 2013

2.1.2 Cyber-Economy
The cyber-ecosystem of a country also comprises the economic activities in the 
related sectors like design, development, manufacturing, export, and import of ICT 
artifacts and e-commerce infrastructure to name a few. Unsafe cyberspace hinders the 
growth of economic activities in general (The Centre for Internet and Society, n.d.)
According to (Keelery, 2020), value of the internet economy across India has 
increased from 125b in FY 2017 to 250b FY 2020 (in billion U.S. dollars). In 
2015-16, as much as 5.6 percent of India’s gross domestic product was contributed 
by the Internet economy. In absolute terms, in the year 2020, $537.4 billion was 
contributed by the Internet economy in the gross domestic product of India. This 
makes a 16 percent share of the Internet economy in the national GDP-2020. The 
report in (Sikdar, 2021) further says that half of the Internet economy share came 
from smartphone apps ($270.9 billion). Phone users working with mobile apps 
contributed 70% to mobile traffic (Sikdar, 2021).
In the Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 (Table 3), India is placed at 15th position 
with a score of 97.5 out of 100 and is ranked at position 10.
2.1.3 Cybercrime and Relevant Laws
Like any walk of public life, cyberspace is also marred by the ecosystem of crime and 
criminals operating in cyberspace. For cyberspace worth being a space, it must have 
a matching and dynamic legal framework to deal with commercial transactions and 
crime committed in cyberspace. Bringing the cybercriminals to book is a nightmare 
for the bricks-and-mortar model of justice delivery (NCRB, 2019; Mehta & Singh, 
2012; Mehta & Singh, 2012a).

2.1.4 Cyber-Literacy
Cyber-literacy involves imparting cognitive and technical skills for effective use of 
internet resources through cyber-infrastructure and computer & internet education. 
In 2021, India had a rank of 73 out of 120 countries for internet literacy (Basuroy, 
2022). It is thus essential to focus on digital awareness and education. For a cyber-
ecosystem to thrive it must relate itself to the masses. It requires that a common citizen 
is literate in cyberspace activities. Further, for self-sustaining cyberspace, a country 
also needs to invest in higher education and research funding in cyber-technologies. 
Mass cyber-awareness programmes and large-scale training programmes for service 
staff, law enforcement workforce, and judiciary are also required (Mehta & Singh, 
2013; Shah, 2016). The main components of cyber-literacy include the following:
Working in cyberspace: It requires basic technical knowledge for accessing 
cyberspace through tools like web browsers, emails clients, social networking apps,

In India, around 30m (3 crores) people were trained under Pradhan Mantri Gramin 
Digital Saksharta Abhiyan – a GoI digital literacy programme over a period of three 
years (2018-2020). Of this, 12.6m people were trained in basic digital literacy in 
the FY 2020-21 alone (Statista Research Department, 2021).
Understanding cyberspace: Understanding the modus operandi of cyberspace 
helps appreciate the appropriate online behaviour, net etiquettes, honey traps, and 
common dos and don’ts while surfing and working in various domains of cyberspace. 
It also helps an individual in understanding the terms of use of internet & services 
and verification of genuineness of the internet content.
Creating cyberspace content: This comprises using tools to design, develop and 
distribute/upload the text, hypertext, images, videos, RSS feeds, and blogs on the 
Internet. Creating and uploading the active Internet content transforms an Internet 
consumer into participating netizen.
2.1.5 Cyberwarfare
For many, cyberwarfare is no longer restricted to fiction books and sci-fi movies. 
In the future, wars shall be fought in the fifth dimension namely cyberspace, apart 
from four traditional warfare dimensions – land, sea, air, and space. A sound and 
safe cyber-ecosystem require vibrant cyber diplomacy and foreign policy and 
preemption capabilities in the cyber warfare domain. Further, it is implicit that all 
the components comprising the cyberspace ecosystem grow harmoniously thereby 
meaning that technological developments in cyberspace; awareness, education, 
and research in cyberspace technologies; economic and commercial activities in 
cyberspace; cyber laws and cybersecurity policies and infrastructure; etc. all keep 
pace with each other, lest skewed cyberspace may result.
2.2 Regulatory Mechanisms in Indian Cyberspace
Primarily, the Indian cyberspace is regulated by the Information Technology Act, 
2000 with its latest amendments affected in 2008 – almost thirteen years back at the 
time of writing of this chapter. Thirteen years is quite a long time when developments 
in the information technology field are considered. Quite a few technologies like 
cloud computing and storage, social computing, big data analytics, and blockchain 
technologies have sprung up in the meantime. New technologies have provided several 
new avenues and modi-operandi to cybercriminals. Various players in cyberspace 
are resorting to highly sophisticated ways to snoop on targets for varied purposes 
(Sarmah et al., 2017; Shailesh et al., 2015).

Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
Although the IT Act 2000 and its subsequent amendment in 2008, are attempted 
at bridging the gap of proper national cyber laws in India, it could not come up to the 
expectations of the dynamically changing turf of Indian cyberspace. With the world 
of cybercrime becoming murkier by the day exponential growth of social media in 
the second decade of the 21st Century, the present provisions of Indian cyber law 
seem wanting in teeth and expanse (Sawaneh et al., 2021). Further, the false sense of 
anonymity in cyberspace lends quite a good number of unsuspecting and innocuous 
internet users to the net of cybercriminals. Major punitive provisions provided in 
the ITA Act 2008 to administer and govern cyberspace are presented in Table 6:
In relation to the corporate operations, techno-legal directives including cyber 
forensics and cybersecurity diligence of the Companies Act of 2013 also are applied 
in addition to IT Act. The Companies (Management and Administration) Rules, 2014 
drafted and notified under the ambit of the Companies Act 2013 have prescribed 
the guidelines regarding companies’ cybersecurity obligations, lest the onus lies on 
upon the company top-level management (Kaur & Ramkumar, 2022).
3. PRIVACY IN INDIAN CYBERSPACE
Information and communication technologies in cyberspace affect human privacy in 
very different ways that were previously not even possible. An individual’s privacy 
may be encroached upon in more ways than one and digital devices have only added 
teeth and expanse to such incursions upon personal privacy (Schwartz, 1999). Modern 
smartphone devices are all potential surveillance devices with several apps having 
user permissions to access phonebooks, microphones, cameras, location, images, 
audio, and videos files stored on the device (Lindsay, 2014; Ardhapurkar et al., 2010).
Further, with ever-increasing social and economic interactions taking place online, 
individuals share their personal information while using various internet services 
and particularly so while surfing social media networks. The personal information 
so shared include name, email, birthday, vocation, hometown, workplace and home 
addresses, real-time locations, interests, status, relationships, photos, videos, etc. 
Millions of smartphone users of free mobile apps run at a risk of their personal 
information being sold and misused by the promoters of free apps. In lands with no 
Data Protection Laws/Rules, there is no legal remedy in case of misuse of personal 
information by these apps. In the situation elucidated above, the importance of data 
and privacy protection gains importance (Khan, 2013).

223
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
3.1 Privacy Laws in India
In India, two cases, decided by its Supreme Court, have cast doubts on its citizens’ 
Right to Privacy. In both the cases, namely, M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra of 1954 
and Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh of 1962, the apex court had held that 
privacy was not a fundamental right. These two decisions were pronounced by eight-
judge and six-judge benches, respectively. But, in 2017, a nine-judge constitutional 
bench of the Supreme Court of India, in Puttaswamy v. Union of India, has ruled 
that the right to privacy is a fundamental right, albeit, it is not absolute.
Thereafter, independent analysts have held informational privacy as one of the 
facets of privacy rights. Threats to the breach of information privacy may come from 
state as well as non-state actors. This warrants that Union Govt. place a personal 
information protection regime to safeguard the informational privacy of its citizens.
3.2 Privacy Invasion in Digital Age
The incursion on someone’s privacy could happen in one of the following two ways 
(DeVries, 2003):
(a) 	 Intruding the personal privacy (breech of autonomy): This involves intrusion 
upon an individual’s seclusion by way of snooping, recording, or listening to 
her/his private activities; or trespassing into an individual’s private property. 
Concrete instances of this kind of intrusion include photographing someone 
in a try-room, call recording, hacking someone’s account on a bank server or 
an email server.
(b) 	 Misuse of private information: This kind of breach involves disclosing an 
individual’s private information, such as medical history or sexual orientation, 
without permission. Very often, there is an overlap in two types of privacy 
invasion, and sometimes occurrence of one kind of privacy breach leads to 
another kind of breach as well.

Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
Breach of personal information may have far-reaching repercussions on an 
individual’s life. For instance, our personal information like customer names, Aadhaar 
number (India’s national personal id), addresses, income and expenditure details, 
call details, internet access details, travel details, purchase preferences, music and 
entertainment choices, credit score, and credit history, study loans, driving records, 
educational certificates, marital status, etc. are not stored on devices within our 
confines and control (DeVries, 2003).
Another dimension of informational privacy is someone’s medical and health-
related information, wherein its breach might lead to life-shattering experiences, for 
example, disclosure of someone being HIV positive can ruin her/his social life and 
can even affect the professional life and workplace. Personal information databases 
maintained by banks, NBFCs, Govt. agencies like UIDAI/Aadhaar pose problems 
in the realm of digital information privacy (Singh & Malik, 2021).
Search, watch, and seizure of someone’s digital property and personal information 
is quite different from that of physical property. Digital information may be 
searched, copied, and (mis)used even without the owners being aware of it. Once the 
unauthorized control of digital resources is taken, existing digital information may 
be changed/manipulated and new incriminating material may be planted. Further, 
searching and removing a “banned” book or a copy of a periodical from circulation 
is difficult in comparison to tracking (and taking down) the digital content on the 
Internet (Schwartz, 1999; (Schwartz, 1999a)).
In the Bhima-Koregaon case of 2018, the digital forensic report by a US-based 
cyber- forensic lab “Arsenal Consulting” has claimed that the computer of one of 
the co-accused Ms. Rona Wilson was hacked, and as many as 22 computer files 
were planted days after the January 2018 violence. These files have been cited as 
evidence by Maharashtra police and the National Investigating Agency (NIA) of 
India (Schwartz, 1999b).
Data mining and big data analytics can be used by state authorities to profile 
marginalized sections of society to draft welfare schemes or to snoop them to 
preempt any impending uprising. China is using its “Police Cloud” to keep track 
of its religious and ethnic minorities. Social media companies have more access to 
users’ personal information than the user herself/himself (Benwal, 2021).
3.3 Privacy in Digital India
Privacy concerns in the digital age could be attributed to state and non-state actors, 
both. In the name of all-important national security, security agencies of the state 
profile their citizens based on their digital life. Profiling a whole lot of public segments 
through a bricks-and-mortar model may be impractical, whereas, digital profiling 
techniques are faster and less resource-intensive. Accordingly, states indulge in citizen 

225
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
profiling in the name of (and for the purpose of) national security. Of lately, the 
capabilities of non-state actors to process and (mis)use has increased dramatically. 
For instance, Uber knows where we visit frequently. In case, we use Google online 
maps, then Google knows we stopped for a roadside tea or a breakfast (Network of 
Chinese Human Rights Defenders, 2018).
Although, specific personal data and information protection law has not been 
promulgated in India as yet (July 31, 2021), yet sections 43, 66(E) and 72 specify the 
penalty and punishment for violation of privacy. Section 43 of the IT Act, although 
not directly addressing the privacy issue, provides for payments of compensation up 
to ₹1 crore for downloading, copying, extracting, destroying, deleting, or altering 
any data or information that may cause a wrongful loss or wrongful gain to a person.
Section 66E addresses, albeit limited to images of the private area of a person, 
the issue of punishment for violation of privacy in the digital space. Anybody 
who intentionally, and without her/his consent, captures, publishes, or transmits 
the images of her/his private area is liable to be punished with a jail term of up to 
three years or a fine up to ₹2 lac, or both. Section 72 also specifies the “penalty for 
breach of confidentiality and privacy”. A person who discloses to other person(s) 
“any electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document 
or other material without the consent of the person concerned” in a manner not 
otherwise allowed in IT Act, shall invite punishment of a jail term up to two years, 
or a fine up to ₹1 lac or both. Next subsection (3.4) discusses the Digital Personal 
Data Protection Act 2023 - another stepping stone in the privacy debate in Indian 
cyberspace in somewhat more details.
3.4 Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023
Both, to protect the right of individuals to protect their personal data and recognise 
the need to process such personal data for governance purposes, on August 11, 2023, 
the Indian government announced the passage of the Digital Personal Data Protection 
Act, 2023, which, in contrast to the European GDPR, places a strong emphasis on 
consent as the main legal justification for processing personal data. The following 
requirements must be met: consent must be “freely given,” “specific,” “informed,” 
“unconditional,” and shown by a “clear affirmative action.” However, the Act gives 
the federal government the authority to inform specific Data Fiduciaries—any 
organisation or person that chooses the objectives and methods for processing 
personal data—of certain exemptions from specific requirements. One such need is 
“notice for consent.” In the case of these entities, the duty to obtain free and informed 
permission will still be in effect. However, it may be claimed that a Data Principal 
(a person whose data is being processed) will not be able to grant informed consent 
if there is no requirement to provide notification for consent (Mathias, 2023).

226
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
However, questions are raised regarding the government’s exemptions, which 
would undermine the act’s intended purpose. In certain circumstances, the rights 
of the data principal and the duties of the data fiduciaries (apart from data security) 
do not apply. These consist of (i) crime prevention and investigation, and (ii) the 
upholding of legal rights or claims. Certain activities may be exempted by the 
central government from the Bill’s application through notification. These consist 
of (i) processing by government organisations for the sake of state security and 
public order, and (ii) gathering data for research, archiving, or statistical purposes 
(Nagrajan et al., 2023).
The Act also leaves open the possibility of harm from the handling of personal 
data. Financial losses, identity theft, reputational damage, prejudice, and illogical 
surveillance and profiling could all occur as a result of processing personal data. 
The Data Principal also lacks the ability to receive data in an interoperable format 
or the right to restrict the release of personal data via the internet, in contrast to 
entities of a similar nature in several jurisdictions (Nagrajan et al., 2023).
The passing of DPDP Act 2023 has had two effects on RTI Act 2005. The 
RTI Act is explicitly prohibited from allowing a third party to get an individual’s 
personal information, even though it has improved an individual’s access to personal 
information kept by the controllers and data fiduciaries. The DPDP Act requires 
reporting of specific misuses of personally identifiable information about individuals 
that has been digitally stored, but it makes no mention of potential harm to Data 
Principal. However, it does provide for the imposition of penalties in the event 
that its prohibitions are violated. The legislation does not address compensation or 
insurance coverage for injury caused to Data Principal. Additionally, this Act offers 
no safeguards against state overreach for people’s private information (Nagrajan et 
al., 2023).
4. CYBER-SURVEILLANCE IN INDIA
Beginning in the second decade of the 21st century, the government agencies in India 
have introduced a wide array of cyber-surveillance measures, marking a shift from 
targeted surveillance through traditional means to mass surveillance through digital 
means. Surveillance, for the purpose of the present discussion, may be classified in 
the following two ways: (i) government and private surveillance, and (ii) targeted and 
mass surveillance. In this section, governments’ targeted and mass cyber-surveillance 
apparatus in general and the Indian Union in particular, have been discussed (The 
Centre for Internet and Society, n.d.).
Reasonable expectation of privacy to protect human dignity has been acknowledged 
and incorporated to varying extents in the constitutional frameworks of democracies 

227
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
across the globe. But, since the writing of constitutions and the digital revolution are 
not temporally synchronized, states’ security agencies don’t apply the same standard 
to cyberspace searches as are usually applied to the search of physical evidence. In 
the hyped national security environment all over the world, efforts of digital tuning 
of legislative frameworks are not paying due attention to digital privacy concerns 
(DeVries, 2003).
In India, the vast powers of the Union and Provincial governments to snoop on its 
citizens stem from the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Information Technology 
Act, 2000. While the former law was promulgated in the colonial era itself, the latter 
too has reflections of pre-independence laws. To add to brawl are the state acts like 
MCOCA, permitting the state government to intercept communications.
4.1 Targeted and Mass Surveillance
Targeted surveillance is a form of scrutiny aimed at a specific individual or an 
organization of interest upon the existence of a prior suspicion. In most jurisdictions 
including India, there is a concept of lawful interception under certain circumstances. 
Lawful targeted surveillance is allowed in Indian jurisdiction under Telegraph Act, 
MCOCA1, and UAPA2.
Mass surveillance encompasses an entire or a major part of a population or an 
ethnic group to monitor their social, economic, political, or even religious interactions. 
This kind of surveillance is often carried out by agencies on the part of provincial and 
federal governments. United States’ NSA’s project PRISM belonged to this category. 
The legality of mass surveillance projects is decided by the law of the land, but as 
a rule of thumb, mass surveillance is an indicator of a totalitarian regime. Mass 
surveillance is often linked to compromised dignity and privacy of citizens, limited 
political and civil rights, as also to national security, terrorism, and social unrest. 
The remainder of this section discusses the various surveillance regimes in India.
U/s 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the governments – Union as well as State 
- are empowered to take possession of any telegraph3 or intercept any telegraphic 
communication4 in the matters of public emergency, public safety, national security, 
sovereignty and integrity, friendly relations with foreign states, and to pre-empt 
an offence. The law, however, pre-requires the Officials of the Ministry of Home 
Affairs to follow the procedure laid down in the law5. In India, although telephone 
tapping is considered a serious invasion of an individual’s privacy and the right to 
privacy has been upheld as a fundamental right6. All in all, citizens’ privacy right in 
India is not absolute but is subject to certain restrictions laid down by its apex court.
Under section 14 of MCOCA, interception of wire, electronic, or oral 
communications are permitted by the prior approval of competent authority, and the 
intercepted artifacts are admissible evidence in the court of law. Such permissions 

228
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
are allowed only to investigating officers of the rank of Superintendent of Police 
and further subject to rigorous prerequisites.
Also, UAPA has been alleged to interfere with a person’s privacy in an arbitrary 
and unlawful manner. “Personal Knowledge” of the investigating officer without 
any written validation whatsoever from the judiciary suffices for searches, seizures, 
and arrests. UAPA also empowers the officers to intercept the accused person’s 
communications without any independent prior approval or monitoring.
4.1.1 Lawful Interception and Monitoring
Installation of Lawful Interception mechanism is a prerequisite for every licensed 
telecommunication network and internet service provider. LIM is a secret mass 
cyber- surveillance system deployed and operated by the Centre for Development 
of Telematics (C- DOT). This mechanism allows the GoI agencies to intercept 
voice and video calls, text and multimedia messages, internet traffic, subscriber’s 
particulars, call history, recharge and payment history, emails, browsing history, 
and other such user activities of Indian users. The LIM mechanism is deployed 
at the gateways of desired ISP(s) and its capabilities bypass the ISPs. Of late, as a 
licensing requirement, telcos in India have to deploy LIM on their own to enable 
the GoI to “lawfully intercept” the user traffic (The Centre for Internet and Society, 
n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.).
LIM is carried out u/s 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, read with rule 
419(A) of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules of 2007, notified under this Act. 
Further, on January 2, 2014, the Department of Telecommunication, GoI has issued 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for lawful interception of communications 
in the country (The Centre for Internet and Society, n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.).
4.1.2 National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)
NATGRID was established in 2009 in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks of 
2008. NATGRID has access to real-time data collected by 21 different organizations 
including banks, insurance companies, railways, immigration, telcos, and income 
tax department. NATGRID shares its information with 11 central agencies which 
include the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), National 
Investigation Agency (NIA), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Narcotics 
Control Bureau (NCB), and Enforcement Directorate (ED) among others. NATGRID 
is a tool, and not an agency, that helps security agencies to find and locate terror 
suspects by using data sets pooled by 21 organizations mentioned above. NATGRID 
has been criticized on the two charges – usurping of privacy in the name of national 
security and efficacy in achieving its stated goal of preempting terror, for it does 

229
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
not share information with states’ agencies (The Centre for Internet and Society, 
n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.).
4.1.3 Centralised Monitoring System (CMS)
CMS is a centralized mechanism of intercepting telecommunications bypassing the 
telecom operators to screen all kinds of traffic including messages, voice calls, and 
internet usage. Software running at CMS server(s) is supposed to sniff the telecom 
signals to classify them into genuine communication and otherwise. Intricacies of 
traffic analysis algorithms have become very sophisticated with the incorporation 
of classification techniques empowered by data mining, big data analytics, machine 
learning, and deep learning. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below show monitoring mechanisms in 
the pre-CMS and post- CMS era, respectively (The Centre for Internet and Society, 
n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.; Litton, 2015).
Figure 1. Indian surveillance regime in pre-CMS era
(Nagrajan et al., 2023)

230
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
4.1.4 Network Traffic Analysis (NETRA)
NETRA is an Indian Government software system developed for interception and 
analysis of internet traffic filtered using a pre-defined but dynamic logic. The 
system has been designed and developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence 
and Robotics (CAIR), a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
laboratory, and is used by the IB and RAW, India’s internal and external security 
outfits, respectively. Modus operandi wise, NETRA is different from the CMS. 
NETRA watches everything the target users do online, whereas the CMS taps the 
communication network. NETRA can monitor the text contents of your emails, 
Facebook chats, and blogs using keyword-based filters (The Centre for Internet and 
Society, n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.; Joshi & Das, 2015).
4.1.5 National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC)
The National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC), an MHA entity, is a multiagency 
entity capable of performing assessing the cyber-threats in real-time. This Centre 
generates reports whereupon law enforcement agencies can take proactive and 
pre-emptive actions. Singh & Malik (2021) mentions the multiplicity of central 
and state agencies that take care of Indian cyberspace. NCCC defends the country 
from cyberattacks by coordinating between multiple security agencies. According to 
industry standards, the Centre may be classified as a mass surveillance system with 
its modus operandi exempted from the Right to Information Act – the transparency 
law of the land. According to Govt. sources, NCCC shall be the first line of defense 
against cyber threats against the state’s sensitive digital infrastructure.
4.1.6 National Technical Research Organization (NTRO)
NTRO has been established in the aftermath of Kargil War – a limited armed conflict 
between the armed forces of India and Pakistan around the mid of 1999. As per the 
NTRO charter, the organization was assigned to plan, design, set up, and operate 
new technical intelligence facilities as also establish secure networks to connect 
various intelligence agencies and develop advanced cyber-intelligence techniques 
like cryptanalysis within India for cyber-defensive and cyber- offensive capabilities. 
The Organization has a classified budgetary allocation and operates under NSA and 
PMO (The Centre for Internet and Society, n.d.; Xynou & Hickok, n.d.).

4.2 The Pegasus Row
The world got to know of iOS exploitation by Pegasus7 in August 2016 when 
Ahmed Mansoor, an Arab human rights activist received a text message having a 
hyperlink to secretive information about torture in UAE prisons. Investigation of 
the hyperlink by the Canada-based Citizen Lab confirmed it as social engineering 
spyware. The investigation attributed the spyware to the NSO Group and the spyware 
code contained entries relevant to Apple’s iOS7 released in 2013.
In India, people heard the name of Pegasus in 2019 when Whatsapp notified that 
its communications might have been compromised by the Pegasus spyware during 
a 12-day time window stretching from April 29, 2019 to May 10, 2019). Another 
controversy involving Pegasus started on July 18, 2021 when The Wire broke a 
story on The Pegasus Project - a collaborative investigation involving more than 80 
journalists belonging to 17 media groups based in 10 countries spread over Europe, 
the Americas, Middle-East and South Asia. The project has been coordinated by 
the Forbidden Stories of France. Cyber-forensics tech-support was lent by Amnesty 
International’s Security Lab and the results were peer- reviewed by Canada-based 
Citizen Labs (Varadarajan, 2021).
Figure 2. Indian surveillance regime in post-CMS era
(Xynou & Hickok, n.d.)

232
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
The data (about 50000 phone numbers) were accessed by the Forbidden Stories 
and Amnesty International, who then shared it with partner media groups for 
attributing the phone numbers to individuals for further investigation. Based on 
the analysis of these phone numbers the NSO potential clients were segregated into 
11 countries, namely, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, 
Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the UAE – in alphabetic order. However, 
just being on the list does not imply that the mobile number has been successfully 
targeted or even a hack has been attempted (Varadarajan, 2021).
The Wire, the Indian partner in the project could attribute credible links of more 
than 300 (less than one-third of the total numbers with India code) India numbers 
to individuals who have used those phone numbers. The Wire team approached 
some 40-50 of about 300 identified persons and could manage to get the devices 
of only 21-22 of them for digital forensic analysis ate Amnesty Security Labs. Of 
the forensically examined India-number phones, 7 retained evidence(s) of actual 
infection by Pegasus, and 3 had evidence(s) of attempted infection Varadarajan, 2021).
5. CONCLUSION
Security was a primary consideration in the conception, design, and evolution of 
the Internet. It began as a communication network and developed into a platform for 
exchanging resources and data. Back then, the main goal was to build a strong and 
resilient communication network that would not collapse completely in the event of 
partial damage. And, with the global cyberspace almost half the size of the global 
human population (and ever-increasing), cyberspace inherits all the traits of human 
society – crime inclusive. India is rapidly turning into a digital nation in all spheres 
of public life, including banking, education, entertainment, military, and NBFCs. 
As a result, privacy breaches, surveillance, and cybercrimes are increasing in both 
terms - absolute and relative numbers. Moreover, the security of Indian cyberspace 
has become a topic of public discussion, as most people use digital technologies 
for daily chores and they have to part with their personal details (Aadhaar card) for 
almost all govt. schemes.
In absence of any specific cybersecurity law in India, the Information Technology 
Act, 2000, a dismally inadequate legislation in this respect, has to be invoked among 
other traditional provisions. The principal aim of the Information Technology Act and 
its 2008 amendment, which added digital signatures, was to facilitate e-commerce 
and related payment concerns. Furthermore, in the meantime, a number of novel 
information technologies have advanced from research to implementation, including 
big data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, internet of things, cloud 
computing, and cloud storage. The IT Act is not simply aware of these developments. 

233
Privacy and Surveillance in Digital Era
Accordingly, to come at par with technological developments and to bridge the gaps 
between technology adoption and the corresponding legal framework, and reassure 
the individuals and organisations operating in the cyberspace, the Information 
Technology Act needs to be amended and a separate special cybersecurity law 
dealing with different facets of the Indian cyberspace also needs to be promulgated.
With the IoT becoming mainline, internet-enabled devices have become ubiquitous, 
in homes and at workplaces. Internet-enabled appliances and other devices are 
assigned IP addresses so that they could be operated and controlled remotely, for 
example, while driving home you can issue voice commands to your car to switch 
on the air conditioner(s) of your home so that you will find your home cool when 
you arrive, or you can open the main entrance to the house without alighting your 
car. An individual’s privacy may be encroached upon in more ways than one. But, 
at the same time, these capabilities add to cyber-threats and possibly incursions in 
your at-home privacy.
Promulgation of the Indian DPDP Act, 2023 is an effort towards addressing the 
issue of safeguarding individuals’ digital privacy and personal data. It gives people 
more control over their data by introducing strict data protection regulations. The 
act requires data localization for sensitive personal information and places onus on 
data controllers and processors to guarantee data privacy and security. Along with 
strong penalties for non-compliance, it also creates a Data Protection Authority to 
monitor adherence to the act and enforce it. In India, where the digital landscape is 
expanding rapidly, the DPDP Act is a major step towards preserving digital privacy. 
However, to what extent does the Act achieves its objectives, will become evident 
in the times to come.
IoT and digital devices like smart phones have the potential to act as lethal 
surveillance devices, and particularly so, with several apps having user permissions 
to access the content of the devices and I/O devices to receive and transmit the 
data using the smartphone. And, with the focus shifted to government surveillance 
in wake of Pegasus Project telephone data leaks, it is high time the government’s 
projects with the potential to surveil its masses are debated and questioned. Pegasus 
leaks themselves need to be probed at an appropriate level and truth must prevail so 
that the citizenry is reassured about their right to privacy, the robustness of India 
cyber-infrastructure, and the security and safety of their digital assets including 
devices, data, and software.

ABSTRACT
Cloud computing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for delivering web services, 
and includes scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. Due to functional overlap 
and diversity, web services form a major challenge for selecting adequate services 
to develop user-provider trust. To address the issue, this study presented a machine 
learning based trusted model to assist users in selecting trustworthy web services. 
In the initial stage, using K-Means clustering method the services are selected 
based on three clusters such as high, medium, and low trust. Next, the trust score 
is generated by evaluating performance parameters to identify the best services. 
Experiments conducted with QWS datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach 
efficiently predicts adequate services with a minimum error rate and high accuracy 
gain. This technique achieves a 99.32%, 99.36% and 99.48% accuracy rates for 
the low, medium, and high trust prediction, respectively. The result shows that it is 
more effective than existing approaches and builds a strong trust relation between 
users and providers.

A Model for Trust Decision, Data Analysis, and Evaluation to Identify Quality Web Services
1. INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing has sparked a great deal of interest from both industry and academia 
since it was proposed (Z. Li et al., 2017). The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) (Mell & Grance, 2011) says that, this computing provides lots of 
services to the users, including PlatformAsAService (PaaS), InfrastructureAsAService 
(IaaS), and SoftwareAsAService (SaaS) (G. Kaur & Bala, 2021; Sahi, 2015). 
Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) (Hormozi et al., 2012; Shyam & 
Manvi, 2016), Microsoft Azure (Nawrocki et al., 2021), Google Cloud Platform 
(GCP) (Liu et al., 2017; Mehmood et al., 2018), and many more. These services 
offer on-demand access to computing resources, such as databases, storage, and 
virtual machines (VMs), as well as higher-level services such as analytics, machine 
learning, and software applications (Abdullah et al., 2020; G. Kaur & Bala, 2021; 
O. Sharma & Saini, 2016). There are several options for selecting a single service 
to complete a specific task. For example, if an individual wants to store their data 
and asks for a storage service, there are multiple options available. Choosing one of 
the best storage services among many is, however, a time-consuming and tedious 
task (Rahimi et al., 2021).
One of the services in cloud computing is web service (WS), which refers to 
a cloud-based service that can be accessed over the internet using standard web 
protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (Padhy et al., 2011). The 
selection of the best cloud service is an important factor in establishing trust between 
the user and the provider (Whaiduzzaman et al., 2014). It also has a massive impact 
on the success and productivity of the business. Trust in the cloud refers to the belief 
and confidence that a cloud user (CU) has in the ability of a cloud service provider 
(CSP) to securely and effectively store, process, and manages sensitive data and 
applications. It covers various aspects, including data privacy, security, reliability, 
and compliance with regulatory standards.
A high level of trust is essential for customers to adopt cloud services and for CSPs 
to build and maintain a loyal customer base (Gupta et al., 2013). It is a key element 
in the achievement of cloud computing and can affect the adoption, utilization, and 
overall satisfaction of customers with cloud services (W. Li et al., 2021). According 
to research (Hasnain et al., 2022), a trustworthy WS has low response time (RT) 
instance values and high throughput (TP) instance values. In contrast to this, the 
disparity between the promised instance values and the original values acquired by 
users indicates untrusted services (Hasnain et al., 2020). But the previous studies 
found that high TP and low RT values can be indicators of a trusted WS, but they 
do not guarantee trustworthiness. A service may have high TP and low RT values 
but still have vulnerabilities or lack adequate security measures, making it untrusted. 
Additionally, even if a service provides guaranteed instance values, these values 

241
A Model for Trust Decision, Data Analysis, and Evaluation to Identify Quality Web Services
may not match the original values achieved by users due to various factors such as 
network conditions, server capacity, and the complexity of the requested operation.
Classifying cloud services as trusted or untrusted depends on several factors, 
including the security measures used by the service provider, the reputation of 
the provider, and the level of control the user has over their data and applications. 
Trustworthiness in WSs is a complex issue that involves a combination of factors, 
including security measures, reputation, compliance, user control, and performance. 
The values for RT and TP should be considered along with other factors when 
evaluating the trustworthiness of a WS.
When examining past research, it was observed that the preponderance of studies 
paying attention only on web service selection (WSS) without addressing customer-
provider trust. In addition, classifying services based on QWS traits and determining 
whether services fall under the categories of trustworthy or untrusted is a challenging 
experience. The precise prediction of possible system performance-enhancing services 
is also a research hurdle. These are the gaps that motivate us to propose a solution 
to these issues. The current research solves the problem of selecting the optimal 
service. The first approach makes the group of different categories of trust based 
on quality attributes. A new set of data is generated, and a novel predictive model is 
then proposed. To check the performance of the model, the research compares the 
novel technique with the existing one. A trust score formula is applied to give rank 
to the most optimal service. This trusted model helps to select efficient services.
The following contributions are made in this paper:
•	
The paper addresses the challenge of categorizing services as trusted or 
untrusted by employing a clustering method that evaluates the value of each 
instance.
•	
The paper provides an extensive analysis of the quality metrics attained by 
users and providers in the area of web services.
•	
A hybrid approach called Supervised Ensemble-Based Prediction (SupEbP) 
that empowers users in selecting trustworthy web services.
•	
The innovative predictive method introduced in this study is thoroughly 
compared with existing methods, allowing for the identification of superior 
performance measure classifiers.
•	
By employing a trust score mechanism, this study successfully resolves 
the selection of the best Web Service Subset (WSS), ensuring optimal 
decision-making.
The remainder of the work is discussed as follows: the relevant literature about 
the existing trust is included in Section 2 of this research. Section 3 outlines the 
paper’s organization. Section 3 describes the problem statement and formulation of

the research. Section 4 is a detailed description of the proposed methodology; Section 
5 describes the experimental findings and discussion; and Section 6 summarizes 
the proposed study and discusses its implications for future research. Fig. 1 depicts 
the general organization of the paper.
2. LITERATURE SURVEY
This section discusses the importance of trust in selecting WSs in cloud environments. 
Based on the discussions, the requirements for a qualified belief assessment approach 
are given; these standards are used to evaluate all existing technologies using a 
standard set of criteria.
Numerous businesses are currently shifting to the cloud due to its extensive 
range of services. And CUs are growing more reliant on these services, while cloud 
suppliers are doing their best to provide the finest service possible to their clients, 
which is a vital job. Previous research has shown the importance of trust for both 
CUs and CSP. This is one method for improving both sides’ performances. As a 
result, trust evaluation and prediction are viable answers to this problem. Many 
service life cycle stages, including service selection (Ding et al., 2014; Somu et 
al., 2018)service composition (Somu, Gauthama, et al., 2020; Yasmina, 2022), and 
service recommendation (Gao et al., 2020; Su et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a) play 
a crucial role in establishing trust between the provider and the recipient. In the 
preponderance of these studies, it is considered that the attributes of service values 
are known. Even so, user, time, location, etc. all affect a service’s QoS value. Hence, 
QoS prediction is crucial to service lifecycles.

Reviewing the literature has shown that there are several distinct attempts to 
encourage the automation of a few aspects of the WSS process. The majority of 
researchers agree that some parts of this process can be taken over by software agents. 
The most important difference is in the criteria that the agents use to choose who 
to appoint. Some researchers use semantics to determine whether a WS is relevant 
to the current task (De Moor & Van Den Heuvel, 2004), while others focus on the 
quality of the WSs [4]. But a lot of researchers have come to realize that trust and 
reputation are important for the success of a system built with the chosen WSs [6].
The study (Hasnain et al., 2020) presents a method to rank WSs based on TP and 
RT using a trust prediction and confusion matrix. According to (S. K. Sharma et 
al., 2016) job opportunities and trust are the two most essential variables affecting 
cloud computing adoption. The research (Saoud et al., 2016) conducted a trust 
evaluation of online services using fuzzy-based credibility, and they highlighted 
the limits of those trust-based WSS methodologies to facilitate utilized end-user 
ratings. Researchers are also concerned about ambiguity and discrimination, which 
influenced end-user evaluations for online services. To address the ambiguity and 
distortions in end-user evaluations of online services, a fuzzy-based methodology was 
presented. Several tests were conducted to assess the recommended trust approach. 
The projected approach enhanced trust feature and resilience, according to the

results. The study (Sherchan et al., 2011) offers a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
based trust prediction model for WSs. Using a dynamic training pool, the proposed 
model employs a dynamic training approach that integrates temporal sensitivity. 
The idea of a continually updated training pool allows the system to assimilate the 
most recent data-based knowledge. The study also covers the development of the 
suggested model and algorithm, as well as its application to real-world data and 
assessment. The study (Su et al., 2017)suggests a trust-aware technique for accurate 
customized QoS prediction. Researchers discover a group of comparable services by 
aggregating them and estimate the QoS of active users by combining the QoS data 
of credible similar consumers with that of similar services. The current research is 
focused on the selection process therefore, Table 1 represents the comparison among 
the previous and proposed research for WSS to build trust.
3. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cloud computing is capable to provide multiple services for a single application. 
The most difficult aspect of this computing is picking the appropriate service 
depending on the user’s needs. This process helps to resolve the trust issues while 
user chooses the services for their system. This section discusses the existing system 
to determine the problem formulation and Fig. 2 depicts the general architecture of 
cloud computing trusted model.
3.1 Problem Formulation
The optimal selection of cloud WSs for building trust whenever it takes input data from 
the services offered by CSPs. The research considers a single CU denoted by {U1} 
and multiple CSPs’ named as {S1, S2, S3,…, Sn}.There are various questionnaires 
originated from the user side to service provider regarding service selection. Can a 
user Trust their service? Which service is efficient, reliable, and optimal for their 
organization? Multiple servers who provide services denoted by {WS1, WS2, WS3, 
. . .,WSn} each of them assures the user about their services. It is challenging for the 
user to choose the best one based on the trust factor. Therefore, the current research 
introduced a reliable model that returns the solution to the problem.

4. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
This section describes the proposed technique along with the process that involves 
trust prediction of WS clients. The subsections define the proposed strategy which 
will be discussed in further detail.
4.1 Dataset Collection
The experiment performed on two WSs datasets collected from the zenodo website, 
generated by (Al-Masri & Mahmoud, 2008), and whose URL links are presented in 
Table 2. The QWS1 dataset comprises 365 WSs, while the QWS2 dataset has 2,507 
WSs with their QWS measures using the WSB architecture.
Each instance in this record shows a WS and the nine QWS measures that relate to 
it. The first nine components are QWS measurements that have been evaluated over 
six days using several WS benchmarking tools. The QWS values are the arithmetic

mean of the values measured during the specified time period. The last two options 
provide the service name and WSDL document reference. The description of the 
dataset can be shown in Table 3.
4.2 Data Preprocessing
The data collection phase is followed by data preparation for data analysis or 
machine learning efforts. It refers to the processes and procedures used to cleanse, 
modify, and prepare raw data for further analysis. Typically, the preparation of data 
comprises the following steps. Data cleaning entails finding and addressing missing 
or inaccurate numbers, outliers, and discrepancies in the data. The transformation of 
the data includes transforming data from one format to another, such as translating 
category variables to numeric variables or scaling variables to a common range. 
Data reduction is the process of lowering the data’s complexity by deleting duplicate 
or superfluous elements or through sampling. The data integration process involves 
merging data from numerous sources and addressing any inconsistencies or disputes. 
Data discretization is the process of categorizing continuous variables into discrete 
groups. Normalization of data entails scaling the data to a common range to avoid 
some variables from overwhelming the analysis across all variables.
For data preparation, the current study employs the data normalization approach, 
the formula for which is presented in Equation 1. The primary objective of data 
normalization is to bring all of the features or variables to the same scale and limit

the impact of characteristics with big values, which can sometimes control the 
learning algorithm or analysis. Normalizing the data guarantees that each feature 
contributes an equal amount to the analysis or machine learning model. The method 
guarantees that the data are of high quality, consistent, and appropriate for further 
analysis, simulation, or visualization. There are many normalization strategies 
used in data preprocessing, however, min-max normalization is employed in this 
research. This method normalizes the data from 0 to 1 and equation 1 is presented 
for min-max normalization.

4.3 Categorization of Trust Value
The experimental data consist of two distinct datasets. In the first sample group, 
the rankings of the services are classified as platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. It 
is absolutely uncomplicated to forecast the online service’s ranking. The second 
data contains simply WS quality characteristics. Hence, it is difficult to forecast 
the classes of WSs based on trust, which complicates the selection process. This 
research employs clustering as a solution to the challenge of ranking WSs.
K-means clustering learning technique is used to group data points into a 
predetermined number of clusters based on their similarity. It is a common approach 
for grouping data, and its implementation is quite straightforward. Below is the 
K-means clustering algorithm’s step for categorizing types of services (High Trust, 
Medium Trust, and Low Trust) are discussed.

STEP 4 Find each cluster’s mean
then
Upgrade cluster centroid.
STEP 5 Reiterate steps 3 and 4 until convergence is reached:
Rebind data points to the closest centroid
and
Update the centroids until the assignment of data points to clusters does not 
change or the centroids stop moving.
STEP 6 Analyze the findings and decide the best number of clusters depending 
on the data and the issue domain.

4.4 Classification Approaches
In this section the classification approaches that are using for experimental work are 
discussed. First this study used existing methods then a novel technique is developed. 
Accurate prediction of trusted and untrusted services is a big challenge (Hasnain et 
al., 2022; Sherchan et al., 2011; Su et al., 2017). Thus, efficient machine learning 
models are needed for a particular dataset; the Table 4 discussed and compared 
different machine learning techniques with their pros and cons.

4.5 Cross Validation
Cross-validation (CV) is an important machine-learning approach to assess the 
accuracy and consistency of a model. It is a useful approach for choosing the best 
machine learning model. Researchers in the field of ML often use k-fold CVs rather 
than other types. But picking the k value selection at random reduces the performance 
of algorithms and is difficult to use. Previous literature shows that many learning 
methods vary in k and model validation performance. So, it is essential to the ideal 
value of k in the k-fold CV.
The study reveals how the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms changes 
when the validation values ​of k = 5, k = 10, and k = 15 are varied. The dataset is 
trained with various classifiers and uses each k number to predict whether a user 
selects a trustworthy service or not. Further it also concludes that a well-selected 
value for k results in more precision.

4.6 Performance Measures
In general, data cleansing and preprocessing serve to generate new data. This 
information is then used in predictive models to generate probabilities as outputs. 
But the issue is how the effectiveness of the model is measured. To solve this 
problem there are some performance parameters available like confusion matrix, 
accuracy, precision, recall etc. The section discusses these parameters that are used 
for checking the effectiveness of the algorithm.
Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to assess the performance 
of an algorithm for machine learning. In supervised learning, it is often used to 
assess the accuracy of a classification model. This matrix summarizes the number of 
accurate and inaccurate predictions produced by the model. It is built by comparing 
the anticipated labels of a model to the actual labels of the data. Typically, the 
confusion matrix is shown as a four-column table, with each cell representing a 
potential combination of expected and actual labels. The following are the four 
cells of the confusion matrix:
True positives (TP): A positive (or target) class was successfully predicted by the 
model.
False positives (FP): The model predicted a positive class wrongly.
True negatives (TN): The model accurately predicted a non-target class (or negative 
class).
False negatives (FN): The model predicted a negative class wrongly.
These are used to evaluate the efficacy of a machine-learning model.
Accuracy: From all the classes (positive and negative), how many of them we 
have predicted correctly. Accuracy should be high as possible. To compute accuracy 
from this confusion matrix, the total of true positives and true negatives must be 
divided by the sum of all four values.

how many of them are accurately predicted. Maximum recall should be preserved.

F-Measure/F1-Score: Comparing two models with poor precision but high recall 
or vice versa are complicated. As a result, researchers employ F-Score to compare 
them. F-score measures both Recall and Precision simultaneously. It substitutes 
Harmonic Mean for Arithmetic Mean by treating extreme values more strongly.

4.8 Trust Score Estimation
The objective of designing the model is to build a relationship between user and 
provider. Therefore, in the next stage of proposed method trust score is calculated. 
Highest value of the trust score indicates the reliability and optimality of the services 
whereas lowest score give the less reliable services. Previous investigation shows that 
there is no single method for quantifying WS quality because different indicators can 
have different values for multiple services. A potential approach for evaluating the 
Quality of Web Services (QWS) involves calculating a weighted score by considering 
a set of relevant criteria. For example, one can create a weighted average of the 
following measures: RT, availability, reliability, TP, security, performance, etc. Next, 
the weighting of each statistic is based on its relative value, with a larger weighting 
indicating greater importance. Then, a score is calculated for each measure based on 
its performance, with higher scores indicating better performance. Multiplying each 
metric score by its weight, adding up the results, then dividing by the total weight 
yields a weighted average score that measures online service quality as a whole.
The current work use Trust Score prediction given in the equation 6 below 
indicated the correct categorization of trustworthy instances originating from WS 
invocations, and then we compute the rank of each WS based on the classification 
results:

5. EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS
This section discusses WS categorization and experimental findings of the proposed 
method. In QWS dataset 1, a variety of services have previously been ranked in 
terms of quality attributes. Therefore, getting an accurate assessment of trust in this 
scenario was not challenging. However, with the second dataset, the ranking was not 
done before. Thus, the KNN clustering algorithm was employed to classify the trust 
level. It divided trust into three categories, of which the first category includes high 
trust which holds services that provide good quality attributes and values. The second 

257
A Model for Trust Decision, Data Analysis, and Evaluation to Identify Quality Web Services
category, named medium trust, includes services that partially satisfy user needs. 
And the third category is Low Trust which holds services with poor metric values.
When this method is employed to evaluate qws1, 246 cases of high trust, 113 of 
medium trust and 5 of low trust are analysed. Similar method evaluated on qws2 and 
finds 1411 high trust, 596 medium trusts, and 500 low trust instances are examined. 
These two newly generated data are applied as inputs to various classification 
algorithms. According to the paper’s findings, the following nine algorithms selected 
for the evaluation named as Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Bayesians 
Network (BN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost 
(AB), Neural Network (NN), Deep Learning (DL), and Proposed Method (PM). The 
outcomes of several machine-learning methods and their corresponding parameter 
values ​are shown in Table 5. It also includes other parameters such as precision, 
recall, and f-score for the various methods.
Afterward, k-fold cross-validation is used in order to identify the best model. 
Different values ​of k = {5, 10, 15} are used for model building and assigned for 
model validation. For qws1, both BN and NB algorithms achieved a maximum 
accuracy value of 94.78% when k=15 and k= {5, 10} respectively. Compared with 
both of these algorithms LR attains a low value i.e. 91.48% when k=10. But RF 
obtains highest value i.e. 96.43% when k = {5, 10}. Next SVM and AB both reached 
highest accuracy of 98.35% when k=15 and k=10 respectively. Compared with both 
NN gets 1% less value i.e. 97.53% when k= {5, 10}. Next, DL accomplish value of 
95.88% which is highest than BN, NB, and LR but lower than RF, SVM, AB, and NN.
In case of qws2, both BN and NB algorithms achieved a maximum accuracy 
value of 95.33% and 93.70% respectively when k= 10. Compared with both of 
these algorithms LR attains 94.85% when k= {5, 10} which is lower than BN and 
highest than NB. But AB and SVM both obtains highest value i.e. 98.17% and 
98.01% respectively when k = 10. RF obtained lowest accuracy value i.e. 92.60% 
when k=15. NN gets 96.93% when k= 15. Next, DL accomplish value of 92.85% 
when k=10.From the Table 5, the study conclude that in both datasets the proposed 
technique achieved highest value among all existing algorithms.
Fig. 3 shows the accuracy plot of different classification algorithms. The diagram 
conclude that proposed method achieves the maximum values ​of 98.99% at 10-fold, 
98.78% at 5-fold, and 98.32% at 15-fold for QWS dataset 1. From Fig. 4 depicts that 
QWS dataset 2 achieves the highest accuracy percentile values ​at 98.60% 15-fold, 
98.56% 10-fold, and 98.48% 5-fold in case of proposed method.
The previous literature study provided valuable suggestions for choosing 
trustworthy providers. However, there are some drawbacks highlighted by the 
researcher and the research gaps are discussed below. When choosing a WS, it’s 
important to consider quality web attributes of the application to ensure that user can 
trust the provider. To make decision for CU the calculation of trust using prediction 

258
A Model for Trust Decision, Data Analysis, and Evaluation to Identify Quality Web Services
and ranking mechanism are considered. But still there are other factors such as 
security, reputation etc are available.
•	
Reviews related to product where user should read customer reviews and 
check ratings to get an idea of the service provider’s reputation.
•	
The information includes provider’s security measures, such as SSL 
encryption and data backups. It is necessary for provider having a clear 
privacy policy that explains how they will use and protect your data.
•	
The transparency of the company required for open and honest about their 
practices.
•	
Consider the provider’s experience and track record in the industry. Look for 
information on the provider’s support services, such as customer service and 
technical support.
These factors help a user to find a WS provider that provides trust based on 
reliable and secure services.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE
In cloud computing, quality features play an essential role for selection of WSs 
to maximize the performance. Designing a trust model for predicting reliable 
services without assigning any rank is a very complex task. For selection of WS, 
it’s important to consider quality web attributes of the application to ensure that 
user can trust the provider. To solve these challenges, a novel technique for WSS is 
proposed using the feedback for quality attributes instances from WSs users. In the 
initial step, the dataset is partitioned into different classes of trust using K-means 
method. The partition enhances the scoring factors in the prediction of WSs. Next, 
the result evaluation is based on a comparison of various classifications with the 
proposed methods. Hence, the proposed technique outperforms the existing technique 
based on the performance measures. Apart from calculating trust from prediction 
and ranking mechanisms, there are other factors to help a CU make an informed 
decision. Future advancements in the field involve incorporating security factors 
such as encrypted data and privacy policies to support trust mechanism between 
consumers and suppliers. Implementing these advanced technologies will be essential 
in enhancing trust-building efforts.
