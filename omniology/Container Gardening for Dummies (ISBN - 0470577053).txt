About the Authors
Suzanne DeJohn loves plants, botany, and nature. She’s worn a variety of hats 
in her 13 years at the National Gardening Association (NGA), including working 
in the education, editorial, and IT departments. She coordinated NGA’s online 
question-and-answer service and has answered thousands of gardening ques-
tions, giving her insight into just what information people are looking for. She’s 
also written more than 200 columns on environmentally friendly food and 
fl ower gardening for NGA’s Regional Reports, a biweekly online publication 
and eNewsletter. Convinced that gardeners are curious and love to learn, she 
created the Exploring the Garden series of in-depth, online courses that teach 
the principles of botany in the context of the garden.
Suzanne’s varied background also includes a BS in geology from Tufts; 
university courses in botany, soils, and plant pathology; a stint as a research 
technician in plant pathology; and several years as a self-employed artist and 
graphic designer. She’s worked on a landscape crew, an organic farm, and spent 
several years as a cook at a natural foods store. The common themes running 
through these seemingly disparate vocations are plants, beauty, nature, and 
healthy food. In addition to her writing and other work at NGA, she and her 
husband recently opened a small, pet-friendly B&B in Cambridge, Vermont.
Bill Marken is an editor and writer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. 
He served as editor in chief of Sunset, the Magazine of Western Living, for 15 
years. In his career with Sunset, he also worked as a writer for the magazine’s 
garden section, pitched in on several editions of the best-selling Western 
Garden Book, and generally nurtured his interest in subjects related to 
gardening, landscaping, travel, and other aspects of the good life in the 
western United States. He is also the founding editor of Rebecca’s Garden 
magazine and has served on the board of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, the 
major watchdog of the threatened lake.
The National Gardening Association (NGA) is committed to sustaining 
and renewing the fundamental links between people, plants, and the earth. 
Founded in 1972 as “Gardens for All” to spearhead the community garden 
movement, today’s NGA promotes environmental responsibility, advances 
multidisciplinary learning and scientifi c literacy, and creates partnerships 
that restore and enhance communities.
NGA is best known for its garden-based curricula, educational journals, 
international initiatives, and several youth garden grant programs. Together, 
these reach more than 300,000 children nationwide each year. NGA’s Web 
sites, one for home gardeners and another for those who garden with kids, 
build community and offer a wealth of custom content.

Dedication
Suzanne dedicates this book to her husband, Dale Lane. “Your energy,

Introduction
I
n this book, we want to share with you the many pleasures of growing 
plants in containers. While it’s fun and rewarding to grow plants in the 
ground, growing in containers offers even greater options and opportunities. 
You’ll discover an amazing number of plant possibilities and an equally amaz-
ing variety of pots, both purchased and improvised.
Containers make it possible for those without outdoor garden space to create 
beautiful gardens and grow some of their own food — on the front stoop, 
on an apartment balcony, or in a sunny windowsill. And even if you do have 
a yard, you’ll find good reasons to consider growing some of your plants in 
containers.
About This Book
Growing plants in containers is a lot like growing plants in the ground. Except 
when it’s not. This book takes you step by step through the process of grow-
ing plants in pots, from choosing soil mixes and containers, to deciding what to 
grow, to taking care of plants using environmentally friendly techniques. The 
information is organized in a logical way that’s easy to access — you can read 
the book cover to cover, flip through pages to see what catches your eye, or use 
the detailed table of contents and index to hone in on just the information you 
need. If you’re new to container gardening, or new to gardening altogether, this 
book introduces you to what we’re sure will become a most rewarding pastime. 
And if you’re an experienced gardener, you can find enough in-depth information 
and creative ideas to help you take your container gardens to the next level.
Conventions Used in This Book
When we refer to a plant’s hardiness — its ability to survive cold winter 
temperatures — we use the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Plant Hardiness 
Zone map, which you can check out in Chapter 2, and all temperatures are 
given in degrees Fahrenheit.
We also use the following conventions throughout the text to make things 
consistent and easy to understand:

2
Container Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
✓ New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition. Italics are also used for the two-part botanical 
names of plants.
 
✓ Bold is used to highlight keywords in bulleted lists and the action parts 
of numbered steps.
Foolish Assumptions
We don’t expect you to know much at all about gardening. This book is useful 
for both novice and experienced gardeners. We expect that you enjoy grow-
ing plants and will do the work that’s necessary to plant and maintain them.
How This Book Is Organized
The book is divided into six major parts that are intended to lead you 
through all stages of container gardening. The parts are grouped according 
to topic to make it easier for you to find related information.
Part I: Getting Started with 
Container Gardening
Why bother growing plants in pots? By the end of the first chapter you’ll be 
convinced to give container gardening a try. The next chapter describes the 
climate and garden conditions important to container growing. Based on this 
information, you can decide whether you want to stick with plants that you 
discard at the end of the growing season or try your hand at perennial plants. 
Then we get down to the nitty-gritty: How to choose containers and soil 
mixes, followed by step-by-step planting instructions.
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling 
with Single-Season Containers
Most gardeners opt for plants that grow for a single growing season and are 
replaced with fresh plants each spring. This eliminates the challenge of figur-
ing out how to get plants to survive during cold winter weather and lets you 
redesign your container plantings every year. We describe the best annual

 Introduction
flowers, vegetables, and bulbs for container growing. If you’re a beginner 
gardener, single-season containers are a great place to start — they offer the 
most bang for the buck when it comes to beautiful flowers and a nutritious 
harvest.
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: 
Permanent Plantings
Ready to step up to the next challenge? In this section you find a wealth of 
information on climate considerations and overwintering techniques for 
permanent plantings. These are the plants that give year-round impact — 
especially woody plants like trees and shrubs. We look at hardiness ratings 
and how they relate to plants growing in pots. When it’s time to choose 
plants, check out the chapters on perennials; trees, shrubs, and vines; and 
fruits and berries for suggestions on the best plants for specific garden situ-
ations. You also find ideas and techniques for growing plants indoors.
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy
This part is all about taking care of your container plants to keep them 
healthy and growing strong. Like plants growing out in the garden, plants 
growing in pots need watering, fertilizing, and occasional pruning. But 
container-grown plants also require some specialized care, which we 
describe in detail here. To help prepare you for troublesome situations, you 
find details on managing diseases, insects, and animal pests.
Part V: Designing and Decorating
If you need some ideas and inspiration for your container gardens, look no 
further. In this part you find help in determining your garden style, a primer 
on color theory, and some thoughts on texture and form, as well as a hand-
ful of “recipes” for sure-fire container combinations. We finish off the section 
with special container plant opportunities, including cactuses and succu-
lents, bonsai, and water gardens.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you think you can’t garden, not because you have a black thumb, but 
because you’re physically limited in some way, Chapter 21 dispels those 
thoughts. It offers ten ideas to make playing in the dirt possible. And if you 

4
Container Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
think you do have a black thumb, Chapter 22 can help. This chapter has 
handy lists of the easiest plants, the most beautiful edibles, deer-resistant 
options, and more. It’s a handy reference to turn to when you’re choosing 
plants. And if after reading Container Gardening For Dummies your interest in 
plants has mushroomed, check out the appendix where we list some of our 
favorite resources for plants and information.
Icons Used in This Book
We’ve sprinkled icons in the margins of this book to draw your attention to 
important ideas. Here’s what each one means:
 
This icon flags information that you ought to read carefully so that you retain it.
 
When we provide a tidbit of advice that will save you time, save you trouble, 
or help keep your plants healthy, we use this icon.
 
We use this icon to indicate that what we’re about to say will save your life, or 
at least the life of your plant.
Where to Go from Here
Whatever level your gardening skill happens to be, feel free to skip around 
and look for ideas that match your needs and interests. If you’re new to gar-
dening, start with Part I to get a sense of what’s involved in growing container 
plants and the ways your climate affects how, what, and when you grow.
If you want ideas on plants to try, check out Parts II and III. If you’re unsure 
of what soil mix to use, flip to Chapter 4. If you’ve grown flowers in contain-
ers but want to try your hand at vegetables, jump to Chapter 8. You can wait 
until you see signs of pests and diseases before looking at Chapter 18 or read 
it ahead of time so you’re prepared.
Finally, if you need some real-life inspiration, turn to the color section in the 
middle of the book to get an idea of how much you can do with container 
plants.

Gardening

In this part . . .
S
o, how does your garden grow? If your response is a 
slightly wry, “In the ground, of course,” you may want 
to hold that thought until we dig a little deeper into the 
possibilities. Your favorite plants — whether they prom-
ise you the pleasures of blooms, herbs, fruit, flowers, or 
other sensory delights — can take on fresh charm when 
displayed in containers. And better yet, your plants’ new 
digs don’t have to stay put; you can pick up and move 
your mobile gardens, for their benefit or yours.
This part opens the doors to exploration beyond the gar-
den path and provides some of the nuts-and-bolts infor-
mation you need to be a successful container gardener.

In This Chapter
▶ Making the case for container plants
▶ Designing a good look
▶ Putting it all together
E
veryone has the time and the space to have a garden. No matter how 
busy you are or how small your yard — or even if you don’t have a yard 
at all — you surely have room for a plant-filled container or two.
Container gardening is quickly becoming one of the most popular growing 
techniques. And it’s not just for apartment dwellers with limited space. Even 
gardeners with room for an in-ground garden opt to grow some or all of their 
plants in pots.
If you’re new to gardening, growing plants in containers is one of the easiest 
ways to get started. Place a potted geranium or two on the front stoop, grow 
some herbs in a pot by the kitchen door, or sow a few salad greens in a barrel 
planter — before you know it you’ll be bitten by the container gardening bug.
Are you an experienced gardener? Growing plants in containers allows you to 
cultivate a larger selection of plants than you could in your garden. You can 
push hardiness limits, build a water garden in a pot, or, if you’re ready for a 
real challenge, try your hand at bonsai.
Whatever your skill level and garden situation, we’re here to help you grow 
terrific plants in containers. We show you how to match the right plants with 
the right pots and give them the kind of care that produces beautiful results. 
It’s time to get growing!

Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Getting a Closer Look at 
Container Gardening
Containers bring plants up close and personal. You can choose the plant, 
the container, and the location. And when you put them all together, you can 
stand back and marvel at what you’ve created. But container gardening is 
more than just a pretty planter. Here are some of our favorite reasons to sur-
round yourself with container gardens.
Expressing your creative side
Combining plants and pots brings the art of gardening to a whole new level. 
Need convincing? Check out the color photos in the center of this book and 
observe how the size, shape, color, and material of the containers comple-
ment the artful arrangements of plants within them. Containers can enhance 
plants by echoing colors, providing contrast, and drawing the eye to a focal 
point. Now, multiply that effect by combining several containers, and you 
have the makings of true horticultural art.
 
Containers are an easy and inexpensive way to dress up a drab house exterior — 
think window boxes, hanging baskets, and stately urns flanking the front door 
(see the color photos in the center of the book for an example of this). They 
can make your outdoor living spaces more inviting, decorate your deck for a 
party, and provide privacy.
Getting the ultimate in 
gardening convenience
More and more people are growing edibles (vegetables and herbs; see 
Chapter 8) in addition to flowers, and containers make it easy and conve-
nient. Step over to your windowsill to snip a sprig or two of rosemary, basil, 
sage, or any other herb to liven up meals. Hang a basket filled with cherry 
tomatoes on the back porch for a quick, nutritious snack. Even if you have 
a full garden out back, consider adding planters filled with your favorite 
edibles or mixing in veggies and herbs with your ornamentals. Find out more 
about mixing plants in containers in Part V.

 Chapter 1: Why Grow Plants in Containers?
Extending the vegetable gardening season
Because containers sit above ground level and are exposed to the spring sun-
shine, the soil mix in them warms up faster than garden soil, letting you start 
planting earlier. There’s no need to wait until garden soil dries out enough to 
rototill — you can sow cool-season crops like spinach and lettuce in contain-
ers weeks before you could plant them in the ground.
Containers also let you grow crops later into autumn. If an early light frost 
threatens, you can easily cover containers with old sheets or blankets. If a hard 
freeze or prolonged cold spell is predicted, you simply move containers to a 
protected location. When it warms up again, move the containers back into the 
sunshine. Early cold snaps are often followed by weeks of mild weather, so you 
can continue harvesting even after in-ground plants have succumbed to the 
cold. Chapter 2 has more details on climate considerations.
Taking your garden with you
If you’ve ever planted gardens at a rental property and then had to move 
away, you know how disappointing it can be to leave your favorite plants 
behind. In this era of high mobility and frequent moves, container gardening 
lets you bring your plants with you wherever you go. New, lightweight con-
tainers and wheeled dollies make moving plants easy. (In Chapter 17 you find 
techniques for moving large planters.)
Making gardening more accessible
Does the mere thought of spending an hour on your knees weeding make 
your back ache? Well, put those aches and pains behind you. Plants in con-
tainers are easier to reach and need little weeding and no tilling, raking, or 
hoeing.
Containers allow people with physical challenges to continue (or start) to 
enjoy all the benefits of gardening, including fresh air, exercise, healthy food, 
and beautiful flowers, plus the intangibles, like connecting with nature and 
nurturing the soul. Growing plants in containers is a great idea for all garden-
ers, but it’s a must for gardeners with limited mobility. You can locate con-
tainers in convenient places, such as near doorways and water spigots or on 
porches and decks. Turn to Chapter 21 for more ways to use containers to 
make gardening more accessible.

Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
So Many Choices! Knowing 
What to Grow
If you look around your neighborhood, you may think that you’re limited to 
planting the same things your neighbors are growing in their gardens. But 
when you plant in containers, your plant options expand so much that you 
may be overwhelmed by the available choices.
Fortunately, there’s an easy way to begin narrowing down your choices. Your 
first step is to consider what kind of commitment you want to make. Is a 
short-term relationship more your style, or do you want to devote your atten-
tion to a plant for several years?
Testing the waters with annual 
flowers and vegetables
Most people fill their containers with plants that grow for a single season; at 
the end of the season they toss the plants and start with fresh plants for the 
next round of growing. This is the easiest way to grow plants in containers 
because you don’t have to worry about the temperature extremes that chal-
lenge many plants, especially in regions with cold winters. Fear not: Choosing 
this option doesn’t mean you sacrifice anything. Some of the biggest, bright-
est, and longest-blooming flowers are ideal for single-season containers, as 
are most vegetables. For example, petunias, impatiens, beans, and tomatoes 
are grown as annuals and enjoyed for a single growing season. They require 
just a few months of commitment from you.
Promising to nurture and protect 
in summer and in winter
Permanent container plantings — those that last for a few years or longer — 
require more commitment from you, but they also reward you in ways single-
season plants can’t. If you want to pick peonies for bouquets or harvest 
peaches for pie, you need to think long-term. Plants for permanent plantings 
include perennials, trees, shrubs, fruits, and berries. Most plants in these cat-
egories adapt readily to growing in containers; the biggest challenge lies in 
helping them survive cold winter weather. Container-grown plants are more 
vulnerable to temperature extremes than plants growing in the ground, so 
you need to take steps to protect them. However, with some careful planning 
and diligence on your part, you can have that vase filled with peonies and 
plenty of peaches for pie.

 Chapter 1: Why Grow Plants in Containers?
Helping Your Container Plants Thrive
Caring for plants in containers has its ups and downs. On one hand, con-
tainer gardening is easier than traditional gardening — you don’t have to 
do any weeding; you can leave the heavy tools in the garage; you can pluck 
the plant out of the container and toss it in the compost pile at the end of its 
growing season.
But the catch is that plants in containers need a little more ongoing attention 
than plants in the ground. Container plants depend on you for their water 
and nutrients. They can’t send their roots out beyond the container to find 
what they need to survive. The following sections take a closer look at some 
of the pros and cons of caring for plants in containers.
Meeting a plant’s exacting requirements
Containers let you grow plants with very different requirements side by side 
because you can give individual plants the exact conditions that they need — 
conditions that may be impossible to achieve in your garden.
Consider azaleas and cactuses, for example. With containers, you can plant 
azaleas in acid soil and cactuses in sandy soil (see Chapter 4 for the dirt on 
soil). You can water azaleas abundantly and cactuses sparingly (see Chapter 15 
when you’re ready to wet your plant’s whistle). You can relocate plants as nec-
essary to provide optimum sunlight levels — part shade for azaleas, full sun for 
cactuses.
Container growing also improves the productivity of some vegetable crops. 
For example, northern gardeners often get a larger, earlier harvest of egg-
plants and peppers when they grow them in containers because the sun 
warms the soil, speeding the growth of these heat-loving plants.
Minimizing pesky pest problems
Garden soil often harbors microbes that cause plant diseases. For example, 
fusarium wilt and early blight are two soil-borne diseases that can infect 
tomato plants when raindrops splash soil onto plant foliage. By growing 
plants in sterile potting mix, you eliminate the source of these diseases 
(Chapter 4 talks about soil mixes).
Insects that pass from plant to plant in the garden are less likely to find 
potted plants up on a deck or porch. And when you discover a pest problem, 
you can isolate affected plants by moving their pots away from those of other 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
plants until the problem is under control. Chapter 18 covers prevention and 
treatment of pests and diseases.
Facing the challenges of 
growing in containers
Something that we can’t stress enough is that a container is not a natural 
place for a plant to grow. Because of this, container plants usually involve 
more of a time commitment than the same plants in the ground.
A plant growing in the ground develops an extensive network of roots to 
take in water and nutrients, and the ground insulates the roots from wide 
temperature swings. In a container, on the other hand, roots are confined, 
so the plants need a constant supply of water and nutrients. Plus, the soil 
mass in a container is small, so it heats up faster in the sun, chills down more 
quickly during cold spells, and dries out much sooner on a sunny day. (Flip 
to Chapter 2 for more insights on how climate influences container growing.)
A container garden may need daily tending, depending on the size and type 
of container, what’s growing in it, and the weather. Plus, you may need to 
tackle a few chores that don’t apply to in-ground plants — repotting plants 
and cleaning and preserving containers, for example. (Part IV is all about how 
to care for container plants.)
But overall, we think the extra effort is worth it, or we wouldn’t be writing 
this book!
Matching Plant to Location
Some plants need full sun to thrive, but any place that has sufficient light to 
read by is a suitable location for some type of potted plant. The key is choos-
ing the right plant for the spot. An open, sunny area on your patio calls for 
something dramatic, such as a fruit tree or big pot of petunias; indoors, the 
corner of your desk may be a perfect spot for a small philodendron or spider 
plant. The great thing about growing plants in containers is that you’re not 
limited by climate, how much space you have, or the plants commonly avail-
able at most garden centers. Read on for details.

13
 Chapter 1: Why Grow Plants in Containers?
Growing plants in impossible places
Don’t have yard space for a garden? Use containers, and you can grow plants 
anywhere — on a rooftop, a small condominium patio, the porch of a mobile 
home, or the deck of a houseboat.
Perhaps you want to grow tomatoes, but your entire yard is shaded except 
for one spot by the front porch. Pot up a few plants and you’ll have your 
tomatoes and eat them, too.
Maybe you have acres of space for a garden, but the soil is rocky, or hard 
clay, or otherwise uninviting to plants. When you grow in containers, you 
choose the soil mix that best suits your plants’ needs. (Find out more about 
soil in Chapter 4.)
Expanding your gardening palette with 
plants outside your hardiness zone
Containers let you grow a greater variety of plants than you ever thought 
possible. You can push the limits dictated by your hardiness zone because 
you can move plants to a protected area during winter, letting you grow 
oranges in Minneapolis and avocados in Vermont.
Fabulous figs, beautiful bougainvillea, luscious lemons and limes — the pos-
sibilities are endless, even in frosty climates, once you know how to protect 
plants from the cold. (In Chapter 2 you can read more about the challenges of 
climate and techniques to overwinter plants.)
Inviting nature into your indoor 
and outdoor living spaces
Shopping malls, office buildings, and urban parks are filled with plants for a 
reason: Plants make people happy! They’re beautiful, they’re fragrant, and 
they provide a subliminal connection with nature that both inspires and 
calms. (The color green is considered soothing — one explanation for the 
term green room, where actors wait before going on stage.)

14
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Indoors, not only are houseplants decorative, but many also cleanse the air 
of toxins. Be bold! In addition to a few window plants, use a line of tall plants, 
such as bamboo or palms, as living screens between rooms. Use containers 
to reinforce your decorating style — minimalist, baroque, or country-casual. 
(Explore more possibilities in Chapter 14.)
Use container plants in the landscape to define outdoor “rooms” by creating 
a visual separation between areas with different uses (the grilling and eating 
areas, for example). Use containers to control traffic flow, to temporarily 
block unsightly views, or to define a private reading nook.
Designing with Container Plants
To whet your appetite for what’s to come in this book, imagine a few of the 
following containers in your landscape. We give you the “recipes” for these 
and others in Chapter 19:
 
✓ Nature’s bounty: Grow the tastiest and most nutritious fruits right on 
your deck or patio. Start by planting a dwarf peach tree in a wooden 
half barrel. Add three strawberry plants, and then dress it all up with 
a border of annual flowers. Sit back and enjoy luscious strawberries in 
spring, peaches in summer, and flowers all season long.
 
✓ Shade-lover’s delight: Forget trying to get grass to grow under that big 
maple tree. Instead, plant a rustic planter box with shade-loving fuchsia, 
ferns, and impatiens. Then sit back in a comfy chair with a glass of lem-
onade and watch your neighbors mow their lawns.
 
✓ Suspended animation: Does your porch lack pizzazz? Fill a moss-lined 
wire basket to overflowing with trailing ivy, bright-faced pansies, sap-
phire lobelias, and wine-red geraniums. In just a few weeks, the basket 
will be blanketed with blooms, enticing passersby to stop and admire 
your creativity.
When you’re ready for something different or more challenging, we offer 
ideas for specialty plants, like cactuses, holiday plants, water gardens, and 
bonsai, in Chapter 20. You can delight yourself and your friends with your 
newfound green thumb.

15
 Chapter 1: Why Grow Plants in Containers?
One Last Thing: Plant Names
Every plant has a two-part botanical name, identifying its genus and species. 
The botanical name always appears in italics with the genus name (which 
appears first) capitalized. For example, Tagetes erecta is the botanical name 
for American marigold. The genus name (Tagetes) refers to a group of closely 
related plants found in nature — all the marigolds. The species name (erecta) 
refers to a specific member of the genus — such as the tall, orange-flowered 
American marigold. (The term species is shorthand for specific epithet, which 
may help you remember that it refers to a specific plant within a genus, or 
general group.)
Of course, most plants also have common names. But common names can 
vary from place to place and from time to time. Nemophila menziesii will 
always be the botanical name for the same plant, no matter where in the 
world you find it. But when it comes to this plant’s common name, some 
people call it California bluebell, while others know it as baby blue eyes. To 
add to this confusion, different plants may share the same common name. 
For example, various kinds of butterfly flowers exist, in addition to butterfly 
bush and butterfly weed. Sometimes, the common name is the genus name. 
For example, the botanical name for the petunia is Petunia hybrida.
Some specialized plants have an additional name tacked on to their botanical 
names, which indicates that it is a variety or cultivar (cultivated variety) of 
that species. A variety or cultivar differs from the species in some particular 
way, such as flower color. For example, Tagetes erecta Snowbird is a white-
flowered variety of the tall American marigold.
Once a genus name has been mentioned, it is sometimes abbreviated to its 
first letter. For example, if you see the names Tagetes erecta and T. patula, it’s 
implied that the T. stands for Tagetes.
You can see why people who want to be precise stick to botanical names, but 
for most of us and for most of the time, common names work fine. However, 
there are times when it pays to double-check — such as when you’re talking 
about salvias and sages (see the sidebar on salvia for more info).

16
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Salvia: One genus, many species
The genus Salvia includes a remarkable 
number of plants with very different character-
istics, although all have similar flower spikes 
topped with asymmetrical flowers, and many 
have fragrant foliage.
Annual salvia (Salvia splendens) is widely grown 
in beds and containers and produces abundant 
spikes of large, colorful flowers in shades of red, 
purple, and white. Although perennial in tropical 
regions, it’s most often sold as an annual.
Common sage, the herb essential to 
Thanksgiving stuffing, is Salvia officinalis.
Meadow sage (Salvia nemorosa) is a popular 
perennial that is hardy to zone 4.
Pineapple sage (Salvia elegans) is a tender 
perennial with fragrant foliage that really does 
smell like fresh pineapple when you rub it. 
Although it has striking, brilliant red flowers, 
they’re not as abundant as those of S. splen-
dens; instead, S. elegans is grown for its fra-
grant foliage.
Autumn sage (Salvia greggii), scarlet sage (S. 
coccinea), Mexican sage (S. mexicana and 
S. leucantha), mealycup sage (S. farinacea), 
anise-scented sage (S. guaranitica), and clary 
sage (S. scalerea) are other relatively common 
salvias with varying degrees of hardiness.

M
ost gardeners grow single-season container plants, and if you’re new 
to container growing, this is a good place to start. You plant them in 
the spring, enjoy them all summer (a single growing season), and discard 
them in the fall. Then you start with fresh plants the following spring — 
eliminating the need to overwinter plants. Annual flowers and most vegeta-
bles and herbs are ideal for single-season planting.
Permanent plantings, on the other hand, are those that keep growing year 
after year. Perennials, shrubs, and trees fall into this category. While many 
adapt to growing in containers, they can pose challenges in cold-climate 
regions. You need to be aware of each plant’s tolerance to cold temperatures.
Whether you’re growing single-season or permanent plantings, it’s important 
to match the plants to your garden’s microclimate — conditions that are 
unique to your container’s precise location in your yard. The degree of sun 
or shade, the amount of wind, the slope of the terrain, and reflected heat 
all affect plant growth. Take the time to evaluate your landscape’s microcli-
mates before choosing plants.
This chapter explains how your region’s climate influences what plants you 
can grow and helps you understand how your yard’s microclimates may 
affect your container plants.
Cluing In to Climate
The degree that climate plays a role in container gardening depends on what 
you’re growing and when you’re growing it. If you’re growing single-season 
containers to enjoy in summer and discard in the fall, you don’t need to 

18
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
worry about winter’s chill. However, you still need to know when the weather 
has warmed up enough in spring so it’s safe to set out tender plants that 
can’t tolerate frost.
If your containers are filled with permanent plants — perennials, trees, and 
shrubs — then you need to tune in more carefully to your region’s climate. In 
most cases, winter temperatures are the deciding factor in what will survive 
in your climate. Intense summer heat can also play a role in your plants’ abil-
ity to thrive.
 
Growing plants in containers allows you to grow plants that otherwise may not 
survive in your climate, as long as you’re willing to take steps to protect them 
from temperature extremes — like moving containers to protected spots.
The following sections won’t turn you into an amateur meteorologist, but 
after reading them, you’ll have a better understanding of how climate — 
specifically, hot and cold temps — affects plants, and you’ll know where to 
turn for more information about the climate in your neck of the woods.
Caring about climate’s effect 
on container plants
Container plants are more vulnerable to extreme temperatures (especially the 
cold) than the same type of plant growing in the ground. Even plants that most 
of us think of as hardy — pine trees, for example, because they thrive when 
planted in the ground — may not survive really cold winters in containers.
In many cases, plant roots aren’t as hardy as the upper growth, and they 
don’t need to be. Although the ground may freeze down a few inches or 
even a few feet, it doesn’t reach the extreme cold of the air temperature. 
A few inches down, the soil temperature may drop into the 20s (degrees 
Fahrenheit), but it rarely gets colder than that because of the soil’s residual 
heat, its insulating qualities, and its sheer mass — even if the air temperature 
is below zero for an extended time.
The soil in containers, on the other hand, freezes solid when exposed to 
prolonged freezing temperatures and, because of its limited mass, it may 
get nearly as cold as the air temperature. Plant roots that can withstand the 
20-degree temperature of garden soil may be killed in containers where the 
soil gets colder than that. And in most of the country, winter temperatures 
regularly drop below 20 degrees.
Temperatures that alternate between freezing and thawing pose another 
challenge. On sunny, mild winter days the soil in containers may thaw. Then, 
during the next cold snap the soil freezes again, and, as it expands, it can 

19
 Chapter 2: Considering Climate
push plants up out of the soil. Gardeners refer to this as heaving. Soil thawing 
during a warm spell can also entice roots to break dormancy too early. The 
new roots and tender top growth freeze when the weather chills again.
Plants in containers are also more vulnerable to extreme heat than plants 
growing in the ground. The soil in containers heats up more, and this heat can 
damage roots. Black plastic and metal containers absorb heat and provide 
little insulation; they’re fine for use in shady spots but avoid them in sites with 
full sun, especially in regions with very hot summers. Wood, terra-cotta, and 
resin containers offer more protection from heat, especially if they’re white 
or a light color. Containers placed on surfaces that reflect heat, such as pave-
ment, are also more prone to overheating. You may need to move containers 
out of full sun during spells of extreme heat, and you’ll definitely want to keep 
an extra close eye on soil moisture so plants don’t dry out.
Factoring frost dates into 
your growing season
Knowing the frost dates for your region is kind of like peering into a horticul-
tural crystal ball. The term frost dates is shorthand for the average last spring 
frost date and average first fall frost date for your locale. These dates are 
based on decades of weather data, but keep in mind they’re just averages. 
Your actual last spring frost or first fall frost may occur days (or even weeks) 
before or after the average.
When you’re growing frost-tender plants, including many annual flowers and 
vegetables, it’s important to know your region’s average last spring frost date 
because it dictates when you can set out most plants. In a place like North 
Dakota, the average last spring frost may be as late as June; in Georgia, it 
could be as early as February.
Knowing your region’s frost dates is helpful even if you’re growing hardy 
plants (more on hardiness in the next section). For example, if you move 
your containers to a sheltered place for the winter, the plants may begin 
sprouting earlier in spring than they would have had they wintered outdoors. 
Then, if you bring the plants outdoors before the last spring frost date the 
chances are good that the new growth will be nipped by frost. To be on the 
safe side, if overwintering plants have begun to sprout in their sheltered loca-
tion, wait until after the last frost date to bring them outdoors.
Knowing the date of the average first fall frost is helpful, too, so you can be 
ready if you plan to move tender plants to a sheltered place. A gardening 
neighbor or your Cooperative Extension service can provide this information, 
or you can consult the maps on this National Climatic Data Web page: www.
ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/freezefrost/frostfreemaps.html.

20
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
Growing plants in containers allows you to take some liberties. You can plant 
before the last frost date in the spring (or keep them out for a few more nice 
days in the fall) if you can move them under cover when you expect cold nights.
Getting a handle on hardiness
If you’re growing annual flowers and other single-season plants, you don’t 
need to worry about winter hardiness because the plants won’t be overwin-
tering. However, if you’re growing perennials, trees, and shrubs in permanent 
plantings, you’ll want to choose plants that are adapted to your climate. 
Although all kinds of conditions determine what plants can grow in a certain 
region’s climate, how cold it gets — rather than the heat or humidity — is 
usually the key consideration.
All plants are able to tolerate cold to a certain degree. Below that minimum 
temperature, a plant’s tissues are damaged or destroyed; if cold tempera-
tures are prolonged, the plant may die. A plant’s ability to withstand a certain 
minimum temperature is called its hardiness (a fuchsia, for instance, is said 
to be hardy to 28 degrees Fahrenheit). Most seed packets and plant tags pro-
vide hardiness information.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes maps show-
ing plant hardiness zones. The zone boundaries are based on one factor: the 
average winter minimum temperatures collected from 125,000 weather sta-
tions. North America is divided into 11 zones, the warmest (zone 11) having 
an average winter minimum temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Each 
succeeding zone, from zone 10 to zone 1, averages 10 degrees colder. Zones 
1 through 10 are further divided into a and b in order to distinguish zones 
where average winter minimum temperatures differ by 5 degrees. Check out 
the map in Figure 2-1.
Protecting plants from a chill
Experienced gardeners keep a close eye on 
the weather, especially in spring and fall when 
cold snaps can threaten warm-season plants. If 
temperatures are predicted to drop into the 40s, 
take measures to protect your plants.
Move small containers into a garage or 
enclosed porch, where temperatures stay a 
few degrees warmer than outdoors. Move them 
back out when the threat has passed.
Cover large planters with old sheets, row 
covers, cardboard boxes, or anything else that 
will hold in the heat. Use stakes to prop up the 
covers to avoid breaking stems on delicate 
plants. If frost is predicted, cover plants in 
late afternoon before the temperature drops. 
Extend the covering all the way to the ground, 
and secure it around the base of the container 
to help hold in the heat. Remove covers the next 
morning once temperatures warm up to the 50s.

You can view a color version of the USDA Hardiness map online at www.usna.
usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html, as well as get a closer look at the 
hardiness zone that covers your region of the country.
Any attempt to divide all of North America into zones is bound to have limi-
tations, and the hardiness map is no exception. Individual plant hardiness 
can vary depending on growing conditions and climate factors in addition 
to winter cold. But the hardiness map is a good starting point. Zone systems 
based on average minimum temperatures are also available for western 
Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China.
Plants mentioned in this book are identified by climate zone according to the 
lowest winter temperatures that they can withstand — when growing in the 
ground, that is. For example, a tree recommended as hardy for USDA zone 
5 can reliably grow in that zone and milder ones (higher numbers) — areas 
where temperatures do not fall below –20 degrees Fahrenheit. As you read 
elsewhere and often in this book, these hardiness zone recommendations 
need to be interpreted differently for plants in containers because they’re 
more affected by temperature extremes. See the previous section “Caring 
about climate’s effect on container plants” for details on why this is so.
 
When it comes to cold hardiness, a rule of thumb is to subtract one or two 
hardiness zones for plants growing in containers. For example, figure that if 
you live in zone 6, you should choose plants that are hardy to zones 4 or 5. 
If you live in zone 8, look for plants hardy to zones 6 or 7. Of course, this 
advice changes if you’re willing and able to move container plants into a 
sheltered spot or otherwise provide protection during cold weather.
When the heat is on: Heat tolerance
The USDA hardiness zone recommendations 
are handy, but in regions with long, hot sum-
mers, heat tolerance is often just as important 
in determining whether plants will thrive. The 
American Horticultural Society developed the 
AHS Heat Zone Map to help gardeners in warm 
climates choose plants. The map divides the 
United States into 12 zones based on the aver-
age number of heat days each year, which they 
define as days that reach 86 degrees Fahrenheit 
or higher. The lower the zone number, the fewer 
the heat days — zone 1 averages less than 1 
heat day per year, while zone 12 gets more than 
210. If you live in a hot climate you may want to 
research the heat tolerance of the plants you 
plan to grow. To be on the safe side, choose 
plants that are somewhat more heat tolerant 
than your climate dictates.
You can download the AHS Heat Zone Map at 
www.ahs.org/publications/heat_
zone_map.htm.

23
 Chapter 2: Considering Climate
 
Gardeners in zones 4 and colder should plan to provide winter protection for 
all of their container plants because even the most cold-hardy plants may not 
survive extreme winters if left unprotected. Chapter 10 has more details on 
how to protect container plants over the winter.
In regions with mild winters, like Southern California and Florida, gardeners 
can plant cool-season annual flowers and vegetables in fall and enjoy them 
into winter — more on that in Chapters 7 and 8.
Determining Your Garden’s Microclimate
In addition to the overall climate, your own outdoor spaces have particular 
conditions that you need to take into account when planning to grow container 
plants. Factors like the amount of sun and wind, the location on a slope, and 
whether there’s reflected heat combine to create conditions at a particular 
spot that differ from those in the rest of your landscape. These localized condi-
tions are called microclimates. We cover factors that influence microclimate in 
the following sections.
 
Portability expands the climate tolerance of container plants. You can bring 
them indoors for protection from the cold, move them into more sun if 
they’re not getting enough, or move them into a shadier spot if they’re get-
ting sunburned.
Shedding a little light on sun and shade
Plants have natural attributes that cause them to perform better in different 
amounts of sunlight. Think about a plant’s native habitat. What’s the best 
garden location for a vine that’s native to the jungle? One that provides some 
protection from the sun, like the shade it gets in nature from a high canopy 
of trees. Give the plant too much sun and it burns like a fair-skinned redhead 
on the beach in Cancun. Conversely, think about a plant with a sunny habitat. 
Zinnias, originally from Mexico, thrive in full sun. In too much shade, they 
grow spindly and develop mildew on their leaves.
Light conditions are classified as shade, part sun, or sun. Plants growing in 
different locations are exposed to different amounts of sunlight, depending 
on their orientation with respect to houses, hillsides, and other man-made 
and natural structures. The exposure of the plant’s location generally deter-
mines its light conditions:

24
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
✓ A northern exposure probably is blocked from the sun all day. This is 
full shade.
 
✓ An eastern exposure, unless it’s blocked by trees or buildings, receives 
sun in the morning and shade for the rest of the day. This is a typi-
cal part sun (or part shade) exposure. The same goes for an area that 
receives dappled shade, such as the space under a tree with a high or 
thin canopy.
 
✓ A southern exposure gets the most hours of sun. This is full sun, and it’s 
usually defined as at least six hours of sunlight during the middle of a 
summer day. Most annuals and vegetables do best in full sun.
 
✓ A western exposure may get shade in the morning and full sun in the 
afternoon — this is usually considered a sunny location because of the 
intensity of the light. Shade plants will probably cook in this location.
Definitions of sun and shade also depend on your climate. Near the coast, 
where it’s cool and often overcast, plants described as preferring part sun 
may do better in a full sun location, and plants that normally love shade may 
flourish in full sun. The converse is true, too. Plants growing in hot, sunny 
climates may need more shade than those same types of plants growing in 
cool climates.
 
Note how the shadows change throughout the growing season. An area that 
was full sun in June may be in part shade by August because the sun is lower 
in the sky and nearby trees, buildings, or structures may block it. However, 
one of the great things about containers is their portability. Move a full-sun-
loving container into a brighter location whenever you notice shadows block-
ing the light.
 
Pay attention to the sun/shade requirements specified for each plant, and 
watch plants for responses after planting. A sign of too much sun is white or 
light brown, burned spots on the leaves. Giveaways for too much shade are 
spindly foliage growth and weak blooming. If you notice those signs, move the 
container or experiment with different plants next time.
Watching out for wind
What about wind exposure? Wind can dry out the soil quickly and rob plants 
of moisture. Stiff breezes can topple tall plants and break brittle ones.
 
If you’re placing containers in a windy spot, be sure they’re made from a 
heavy material like clay, use a soil-based planting mix to add even more 
weight, and choose short plants that are less likely to be blown over. (See 
Chapter 3 for advice on choosing containers and Chapter 4 for information on 
soil mixes.)

25
 Chapter 2: Considering Climate
Surveying slope
Hilly terrain can affect weather conditions. You may find that a sunny hillside 
garden is several degrees warmer than a neighbor’s garden at the bottom of 
the hill. Low spots collect cold air and can be decidedly chillier than nearby 
sloping spots. Hilltops, on the other hand, are often windy. If you live on a 
slope, put frost-tender annuals and marginally hardy perennials midslope, 
rather than at the top or bottom of a hill.
Recognizing reflected heat
Paving, house walls, and other reflective surfaces can warm up a garden. 
These warming effects may be positive if you’re growing marginally hardy 
plants or you’re growing full sun plants in a part shade location. However, 
they can cause problems when reflected heat burns up plants, as can happen 
to plants placed around a swimming pool. Even sun lovers like cactuses can 
be burned by reflected light.

Choosing a Pot to Plant In
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding what your pot will be made of
▶ Picking the perfect size, shape, and style
▶ Selecting pots for off-the-ground spots
▶ Accessorizing to your advantage
A
mong the joys of gardening is the opportunity to express your creativ-
ity, and container gardening doubles the pleasure because you get 
to choose both plants and pots. As container gardening has increased in 
popularity, so has the variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and materials available 
among containers. Add to that the abundant opportunities for homemade 
and improvised pots, and the possibilities are endless.
However, keeping in mind the needs of the plants is vital. In this chapter you 
find lots of info about the benefits and challenges of growing plants in differ-
ent types of containers.
Selecting from All Sorts of Materials
Containers are available in a wide variety of materials, and you can add to 
your options by making your own pots or repurposing other household items 
for use as containers. As you consider pots, keep three key factors in mind: 
drainage, porosity, and weight:
 
✓ Drainage: For healthy plant growth, roots need oxygen, and that means 
that excess water in the soil must be able to drain properly. No matter 
what container you choose, be sure it has drainage holes. And keep in 
mind when you’re displaying plants that the drainage holes can’t be 
blocked. (Flip to Chapter 15 for more on water and drainage.)

28
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
✓ Porosity: Porous materials allow moisture and air to pass through them. 
Pots made of unglazed terra cotta, wood, peat, and paper pulp are rela-
tively porous. Plants in these containers dry out faster than those in 
nonporous containers, which means you have to water them more often. 
The upside is that porous containers “breathe,” allowing air to reach 
plant roots. Plus, as soil moisture evaporates through the sides, it cools 
the soil and helps draw away any excess water.
 
✓ Weight: It’s easy to forget just how heavy moist soil can be. Combine that 
with a heavy container, and you may find yourself with a potted plant 
that’s impossible to move. Container materials vary widely in weight, so if 
mobility is important to you, choose lightweight materials or plan to place 
containers on casters before planting. On the other hand, a heavy pot is 
desirable for top-heavy plants or windy sites, to keep plants from toppling.
In the following sections, we discuss materials that are commonly used for 
containers, along with their strengths and weaknesses.
Your basic clay pot
Clay pots are probably what you think of when someone says “flower pot.” 
Clay pots range in size from teeny-tiny to huge. The bigger they are, the 
heavier they are, and all clay pots are breakable. They come in two varieties: 
unglazed and glazed. (You can find color photos of both in the color pages in 
the middle of this book.)
 
Remember that in cold climates, terra-cotta and glazed clay pots can crack 
when moist soil freezes and expands inside them. Empty containers before 
storing them for the winter.
Terra cotta or unglazed clay
Picture a flower pot, and you probably see a plain clay container — the kind 
Peter Rabbit tipped over while he was sneaking into Mr. McGregor’s garden. 
Terra-cotta (“baked earth” in Italian) pots are usually reddish-orange in 
color but are available in other colors as well, including tan, cream, black, 
and chocolate brown. The pots lack a decorative, waterproof glaze. If you’re 
unsure whether a pot is glazed, moisten the surface — if the pot is unglazed, 
it will absorb water and the surface will darken.
Terra-cotta pots generally offer good value for the money. Their earthy 
colors and natural surface make them look comfortable in almost any garden 
situation, from rustic to formal. Unglazed clay’s porosity allows plant roots to 
breathe and excess moisture to evaporate — desirable traits for many plants. 
However, porosity also means that the soil dries out quickly.

29
 Chapter 3: Choosing a Pot to Plant In
 
If you like the look of aged, moss-covered, terra-cotta pots, here’s a trick to 
accelerate the aging process. Take a handful of moss from your yard (or some-
one else’s, with permission), remove as much soil as possible, tear it into 
small pieces, and mix it with some buttermilk. Use a paintbrush to apply the 
resulting slurry to the sides of an unglazed terra-cotta pot. Place moist soil in 
it (with a plant if you like) and place it in a shady spot, watering as often as 
necessary to keep the soil damp. Moisture will seep through the sides of the 
pot, encouraging the moss in the slurry to colonize the damp clay surface.
Glazed clay
Glazed clay pots are fired with a glass-like coating that makes them water-
proof. They’re available in just about every color and shape imaginable, so 
they offer endless opportunities for creatively mixing and matching plants 
and containers. Glazed pots are waterproof, so they hold moisture better 
than unglazed ones.
Wouldn’t a wood container be wonderful?
Recycled oak whiskey half-barrels are popular planters, although wooden 
containers made specifically for garden purposes are becoming more 
common. Most are made of rot-resistant redwood and cedar. Their appear-
ance is usually rustic, making them at home on decks and in other informal 
places, although fancier designs are available. Wood containers provide good 
soil insulation, helping to keep roots cool. How well they hold water depends 
on the type and thickness of the wood, as well as how tight the joints are. 
Thicker lumber — at least 7⁄8 inch — is better. Container bottoms may rot if 
they stay too moist, so these pots need to be raised at least an inch off the 
ground with stands or saucers, as we describe later in this chapter.
Wood containers are heavy, relatively unbreakable, and stand up well 
to cold weather (though emptying them each winter in cold climates is 
still a good idea). If the sides leak water and cause the soil to dry out too 
quickly, you can line the pots by stapling heavy plastic on the inside. 
Just be sure to punch drainage holes in the bottom to match the ones in 
the container.
 
Avoid growing edibles in containers made from pressure-treated wood. The 
old chromated copper arsenate (CCA) type contains arsenic, a poison which 
has been shown to leach into soil. This type is no longer sold, but it’s still 
around. The new pressure-treated wood uses copper compounds as a preser-
vative, which is considered safe. But I recommend erring on the side of cau-
tion and avoiding pressure-treated wood altogether.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Picking from a plethora of plastic pots
In addition to the plain-looking, green and black nursery pots, plastic contain-
ers are now available in a wide range of styles and colors. Some are made 
to resemble clay pots and do a good job of this, at least from a distance. 
However, plastic won’t develop the attractive patina of weathered clay.
Plastic is easier to clean and lighter in weight than clay. It’s also nonporous 
and doesn’t dry out as quickly. Avoid cheap, poor-quality plastic pots, which 
can fade in the sun and become brittle.
 
Some plastic pots, like the one shown in Figure 3-1, can help you with your 
watering chores. These self-watering containers contain a hidden reservoir 
that you fill with water, and a delivery system makes it available to plants. 
Most often, there’s a wick that draws moisture up into dry soil. The self-watering 
feature is most helpful for smaller pots that might otherwise need daily or 
twice-daily watering. Self-watering containers can be made out of other materi-
als as well, but be careful if yours is lightweight plastic: If the reservoir in the 
bottom of the pot gets too low, plants can become top-heavy and tip over. You 
can also purchase inserts that turn a regular pot into a self-watering one, or 
you can create your own self-watering system, as we explain in Chapter 15.
Cachepots: Gardening’s quick-change artists
Hide an ordinary-looking container in a fancy 
outer pot, and — voilà — you’ve got a cache-
pot. A fancy word for a simple idea, cachepots 
can save you money and let you display your 
best-looking plants. Here’s how: Grow a variety 
of flowers in inexpensive plastic pots. As each 
plant comes into peak bloom, display it in your 
fancy cachepot. When it begins to flag, swap 
in another plant. Just be sure the plastic pots 
fit comfortably in the decorative pot so you can 
easily swap them in and out.
Cachepots also let you display plants in less-
than-ideal settings. For example, say you have 
a beautiful container in a shady spot and you 
want to grow sun-loving petunias in it. Have 
two or three individually potted petunia plants 
and keep one in the cachepot for a week or two 
before moving it back into the sun and swap-
ping in another plant.
Some cachepots lack drainage holes, so they 
can be used on surfaces that may be damaged 
by water. In this case, add a layer of pebbles in 
the bottom to catch excess water as it drains 
from the plant, and empty any water that accu-
mulates in the cachepot frequently.
Decorative containers such as woven baskets 
that can’t withstand constant moisture or aren’t 
tight enough to hold soil are also good candi-
dates for using as cachepots.

The imposters: Fiberglass, 
polypropylene, and resin
Fiberglass, polypropylene, and resin are synthetic materials that are usually 
made to look like terra cotta, clay, or wood. They’re long-lasting, lightweight, 
and waterproof. Some types feel like heavy-duty Styrofoam and are easily 
dinged and dented. Others have a harder shell and stand up to reasonable 
abuse. If you pick up a container and it weighs much less than you expected, 
it’s probably made of one of these materials.
Fabulous fabric pots
Some of the newest and most ingenious containers on the market are made of 
fabric. Offering the ultimate in portability, these small fabric containers have 
handles for easy carrying and fold flat when not in use. They’re constructed 
from heavy-duty fabric, usually rot-proof polypropylene, and have drainage 
holes in the sides and bottom. You can also get long, compost-filled tubes that 
you can arrange in different shapes in your garden. You simply cut holes in the 
top where you want to plant. Check out the color photos in the middle of this 
book for a look at a fabric planting bag and a compost-filled fabric tube.

Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Containing plants in cast concrete
Whether you purchase concrete planters or make your own, you’ll find them 
to be durable, heavy, and cold-resistant. They can be simple troughs or ornate 
urns, and you can dye the mix before molding them or paint them when they’re 
done. Ready-made concrete containers may closely resemble natural stone.
Making a statement with metal
Metal is a favorite choice for antique and Asian planters. Look for brass, copper, 
iron, aluminum, and other metal containers at boutiques and antique shops. 
Metal containers can get very hot in full sun, so you may want to consider using 
them as decorative cachepots to prevent the soil from touching the hot metal. 
Metal containers that don’t have drainage holes also function well as cachepots.
Making your own planter from scratch
Use hypertufa to make your own lightweight, 
faux stone trough planter. Hypertufa is a mix-
ture of cement, sand, and peat moss that you 
can mold into various shapes. It’s commonly 
used to create shallow planters that resemble 
old, weathered stone troughs. Here’s what you 
need and instructions for constructing this 
easy-to-make container:
1 bag of Portland cement
1 bag of coarse sand
1 bag of peat moss
2 rectangular cardboard boxes (The boxes will 
make up the mold. One box should fit inside the 
other with a 2-inch or larger gap in dimension — 
you’ll be filling the gap between the two boxes 
with the hypertufa mixture.)
Note: Wear gloves and a dust mask when work-
ing with dry Portland cement.
 1. Place equal parts cement and sand in a 
wheelbarrow. (For a small planter, start with 
a half-gallon of each, using a half-gallon 
milk jug with the top cut off to measure.) 
Then add two parts peat moss. Mix these 
materials, and then add water until you get 
a stiff “dough.”
 2. Place 2 inches of the mix in the bottom of 
the larger box. Then place the smaller box 
inside the larger box, centering it so the 
gap is even all around. Begin filling in the 
space between the sides of the boxes with 
the mix, packing firmly as you go. Fill it as 
high as you want your planter to end up. (If 
this is your first effort you may want to start 
with a planter that’s no more than 8 inches 
deep.) When you’re done, place the box in 
a dry spot.
 3. After two weeks, pull a corner of the inner 
box away to determine whether the trough 
is hard and dry. If so, fold the box inward 
and pull it out.
 4. Cut or peel away the outer box carefully, 
taking care to avoid damaging the walls. 
Moisten stubborn pieces and then remove 
them. Smooth sharp corners with a wire 
brush. If you like, add texture to the sides 
by brushing the surface so that it mimics 
weathered stone.

 Chapter 3: Choosing a Pot to Plant In
Sowing seeds in biodegradable pots
Many gardeners use purchased plastic six-packs or flats made just for start-
ing seeds, but biodegradable pots are even better, especially for plants with 
sensitive roots, like lupines. Biodegradable pots made from peat, coconut 
fiber, and compressed paper pulp are designed to be planted, pot and all, in 
the ground or in a larger container. The roots grow through the sides, the pot 
decomposes, and root disturbance is minimized.
Reaping the benefits of raised beds
Elevated planting beds made with lumber, brick, or other materials may be 
considered a form of container. Gardeners use raised beds for a variety of 
reasons. Made from attractive materials, raised beds can be decorative and 
add height and interest to a flat landscape. Raised beds also dry out and 
warm up faster in spring, allowing for earlier planting. And if garden soil is 
rocky, thin, or of poor quality, raised beds can be filled with purchased top-
soil. Although raised beds aren’t the focus of this book, much of the informa-
tion applies. (Flip to the middle of this book to see a photo of a raised bed.)
Using a Container with the 
Right Size and Shape
When choosing containers, keep two things in mind: what’s good for the 
plant and what looks good. A pot that’s too small for a plant crowds its roots, 
cutting off moisture, oxygen, and nutrients that are vital for healthy growth. 
If a pot is too big, the superfluous soil may stay too wet and can smother the 
roots. Very shallow containers inhibit root growth; containers in odd shapes 
may make repotting a challenge.
Rules regarding what constitutes the ideal container size differ a bit for single-
season and permanent plants. Single-season, ornamental plants like annuals 
and bulbs can be crowded together more closely than plants you grow in the 
ground, providing much more impact quickly. They can’t thrive in crowded 
conditions forever, but you can satisfy their tight-quarters demands for extra 
water and food for the short duration of a single season.
 
As a rule for spacing plants, figure that if the recommended spacing for ground 
planting is 10 to 12 inches, container planting translates to 6 to 8 inches apart. 
(You can find more advice on spacing in the sections on single-season plants in 
Part II.) As a general rule of scale, if the annuals normally grow 10 or 12 inches 
tall, provide a pot with a diameter of at least 8 inches for each plant. If the 
plants grow 2 or 3 feet tall, better go for a diameter of 24 inches.

34
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
For permanent plants like fruit trees, conifers, and perennial flowers, think 
longer term and choose a pot that looks in scale with the plant when you buy 
it and allows room for a year or two of root growth. As a rule, when buying a 
nursery plant, transplant it to a container that is 2 inches deeper and wider 
than its nursery container. Refer to Part III for more detailed guidelines.
If you live in a region with cold winters, take that into consideration when 
choosing containers because you may need to move plants into a protected 
place. Refer to Chapter 10 for more on overwintering plants.
The following sections explain the features of common styles of pots.
Standard pots: The old standby
Most standard pots — the familiar terra-cotta pots with rims or plastic ver-
sions of the same — are taller than they are wide, allowing the roots to grow 
deep. The tapered shape allows plants to slip out more readily for repotting.
Shorter versions of this standard pot shape, sometimes called azalea or fern 
pots, are wider than they are tall and may be used for shallow-rooted plants — 
such as azaleas and ferns (go figure!).
Pots made specially for forcing bulbs may be even shallower — not much 
deeper than a saucer. You can get away with planting bulbs in such a small 
amount of soil because they have shallow roots, need little soil, and are 
grown for only one season. Succulents and other drought-tolerant plants are 
also good candidates for shallow containers. Check out the sidebar “The tall 
and short of it” for more information about how container depth affects soil 
drainage.
The tall and short of it
It may be counterintuitive, but technically 
speaking, for a given diameter, the taller the pot, 
the better the drainage. To some extent, water 
drains through soil in relation to the height of 
the soil column. In effect, the weight of the soil 
pushes the water through the soil. Practically 
speaking, however, a shallow container has 
more of its surface area exposed to sunlight 
and therefore dries faster than a deeper one of 
the same volume.

 Chapter 3: Choosing a Pot to Plant In
Strawberry jars (also known 
as pocket planters)
Strawberry jars, sometimes called pocket planters, can be spotted at many 
nurseries and garden centers. They’re tall pots with “pockets” scooped out 
of the sides all the way around at different levels. Originally designed to hold 
strawberry plants, they work for other types of plants, too. Traditionally 
made from terra cotta, these planters are now available in other materials.
 
Create a striking display by planting the top and each pocket with annual 
flowers — when the growth fills in, the entire planter will be covered with 
foliage and blooms. Plant each pocket with a different herb, and you’ll be 
ready for any culinary creation. For details on how to plant these pots, turn 
to Chapter 5.
Perhaps you yearn for an urn
Urns are typically made of solid, one-piece construction with a base, ped-
estal, and decorated bowl. You’ll find them made from various materials. 
Urns are available with lots of decorative touches and finishes in all kinds of 
styles. Sizes range from table-top miniatures to massive estate planters. For 
the best results, choose a deep urn that offers ample space for roots. You can 
check out a photo of two urns flanking a front door in the color section in the 
middle of this book.
 
Urns are usually tall and potentially top-heavy, which makes them prone to 
toppling. Choose heavy ones or plan to carefully secure them to prevent a 
mishap.
Improvised containers: 
Choosing the unusual
All kinds of things can be and have been made into containers for plants: 
retired wooden and metal wheelbarrows, old canisters, watering cans, bath-
tubs, well-loved but retired garden boots. The sky’s the limit: Just make sure 
that the improvised container has proper drainage holes and room for roots 
to grow.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Where to find potential containers? Try thrift stores, farm supply stores, barn 
sales, garage sales, antique shops, your grandmother’s toolshed, or estate 
sales. The key is to keep your eyes open and get the word out among friends 
and fellow gardeners who may run into exactly what you’re looking for. 
Figure 3-2 shows some interesting improvisations.

Choosing a Container for a Specific Spot
Plants don’t have to be ground-bound. You can also think vertically when it 
comes to container gardening. You can create a delightful display by planting 
a trailing plant in a container that’s placed a few feet off the ground. The fol-
lowing sections give you some options for containers that are suited to these 
higher-up locations.
Keeping plants in suspense: 
Hanging baskets
Among the most popular and versatile types of containers, hanging baskets 
liven up porches, bring plants to eye level, and in some cases make use of the 
only available gardening space. For the sake of lightness, hanging baskets are 
usually made of plastic or moss-lined wire. Before choosing baskets, evaluate 

37
 Chapter 3: Choosing a Pot to Plant In
where you’ll be hanging them to ensure that the site can accommodate them. 
Can you attach strong, screw-in hooks? Is the wood solid and in good shape?
You can choose from the following types of baskets:
 
✓ Plastic baskets: The most common type, plastic pots are lightweight. 
The pots have drainage holes and may or may not include an attached 
saucer. Small baskets dry out quickly in full sun, so choose the largest 
basket your situation permits.
 
✓ Self-watering baskets: These pots are usually plastic with a built-in res-
ervoir. Water drains into the reservoir and is drawn up into the soil as it 
dries out — great for baskets that you can’t water daily.
 
✓ Traditional wire baskets: Typically made of galvanized or plastic-coated 
metal, these baskets are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
They’re typically lined with sphagnum moss or coconut fiber; some 
may include a plastic liner to keep them from drying out so quickly. The 
open-frame style enables you to plant through the sides so that plants 
can cover the entire basket.
Refer to Chapter 5 for details on how to plant hanging baskets.
The latest twist on hanging baskets is the upside-down planter. The subject 
of countless late-night infomercials, upside-down planters boast all sorts of 
miraculous benefits, some of which are actually true. Usually sold for growing 
tomatoes, they’re really just modified hanging baskets (most are wire cages 
lined with heavy plastic sheeting) with a hole in the bottom. You set the plant 
in from the bottom, fill the container with soil, and hang it up. Tomato plants 
grown upside-down don’t need staking, caging, or weeding, and because 
they’re growing in midair, they’re less likely to contract soil-borne diseases. 
Flip to the middle of this book for a photo of an upside-down planter.
Taking a look-see: Window boxes
Picture a traditional farmhouse with window boxes overflowing with petunias 
and geraniums, and you can see the appeal of these containers. Like hanging 
baskets, window boxes like the one pictured in Figure 3-3 provide additional 
garden space and dress up living spaces both indoors and out. Plant your 
window boxes with fragrant flowers and as the breeze wafts in through the 
open window, it’ll perfume the room. Window boxes also add curb appeal 
and break up visually drab home exteriors. In addition to installing them 
beneath windows, you can attach the boxes to porch and deck rails.
Because the planters are narrow and have limited space for soil, window 
boxes tend to dry out quickly. Traditional wooden boxes look beautiful but 
tend to leak water, so line them with plastic, poking a few drainage holes 
before planting. Or, look for self-watering types to help with watering chores.

Figure 3-3:

boxes can

exterior of 
any home.
 
 
It’s easiest to attach window boxes before planting them, because they’re 
lighter and more easily maneuvered into place.
Trailing over a railing
Designed with flanges that fit securely over standard deck rails, these plant-
ers make it even easier to dress up your home’s exterior. Simply drop them 
in place over the rail and plant away! There’s no need for drilling holes or 
using screws, so there’s no damage to deck rails. These planters are also 
easy to remove to a sheltered location if bad weather threatens, and easy to 
take down at the end of the season. Most railing planters are made from plas-
tic; look for self-watering types because these planters can dry out quickly, 
especially if they’re on a sunny, breezy deck. (Flip to the middle of this book 
for a photo of a railing planter in action.)
Well, hang it! Wall-mounted pots
Perfect for flanking a doorway or dressing up a fence, most wall-mounted 
pots are flat on one side. Planted with colorful annual flowers, they bring 
beauty and scent right up to eye level. The most common types are plastic 
and moss-lined wire.

39
 Chapter 3: Choosing a Pot to Plant In
Another variation on this theme are portable, plastic pocket planters (say 
that three times fast!). Essentially, this type of planter is a tall bag made from 
heavy plastic sheeting, with holes for planting and a handle for carrying and 
hanging on the wall. Plants quickly grow to hide the plastic and create an 
easy, inexpensive, and eye-catching display.
A variation on the wall-mounted pot, living walls are shallow, gridded panels 
you plant with succulents or other small, easy-care plants, then hang on 
a wall or privacy fence as you would a picture. You can create your own 
living art by planting different plants in different grids. (For a photo of a wall-
mounted pot, check out the photo insert in the middle of this book.)
Accessories, at Your Service
To take full advantage of the benefits of growing in containers, you’ll proba-
bly want a few handy accessories. They help you prevent damage to surfaces, 
keep plants healthy, and move heavy containers with ease. The following sec-
tions give an overview of the most useful accessories.
Saucers: Shallow, but necessary
Placed under containers, these shallow dishes help keep water from 
going where you don’t want it — onto a deck, table, or patio, for instance. 
Unwanted water can damage surfaces, cause staining, and just be a general 
nuisance.
A saucer looks better if it matches the container. You can find shallow dishes 
in terra cotta or plastic. Clear plastic saucers are inexpensive and fairly 
inconspicuous. Select a saucer that’s at least an inch wider in diameter than 
the bottom of the pot so there’s enough room for draining water.
Green roofs
Picture dozens of living walls mounted on a roof, 
and you’ll get a good image of what a green roof 
looks like. Sometimes called living roofs, green 
roofs are becoming popular in urban areas to 
capture rainwater and to insulate buildings 
to reduce heating and cooling costs. Most 
green roofs start with a watertight membrane 
topped with a soil-less planting medium. Small, 
drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants like 
sedum are planted to cover all or most of the 
roof’s surface. Although more commonly used 
on commercial buildings, green roofs are gain-
ing popularity for use on private homes.

40
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
Water left standing in saucers means that water can’t drain from the soil in the 
container — a recipe for root rot. Plus, standing water also provides ideal 
breeding ground for mosquitoes. Be sure to empty saucers once water has fin-
ished draining.
Elevation: Giving pots a raise
Lifting containers off the ground has several advantages. A tall stand, either 
purchased or made, can lift plants up for eye-level viewing and nose-high fra-
grance. (Turn to Part V for ideas on designing and decorating with container 
plants.) Raising containers — even just a few inches off the ground — has 
practical advantages, too. Propping up containers allows water to flow more 
freely from drainage holes and promotes better air circulation underneath. 
It allows moisture to evaporate, reducing damage to surfaces. And it reduces 
damage to wood containers and eliminates insect hiding places.
So how do you raise containers? You can buy decorative pot feet, sold in 
many catalogs. You can use bricks or wood blocks (use at least three so 
that your pot is stable). Or, for just a little lift, you can use hose washers on 
masonry surfaces.
Free-wheelin’ it
If you anticipate needing to move large, heavy containers, invest in some 
sturdy plant dollies and put the containers on them before you fill them with 
soil and plants. (After planting they may be too heavy to lift.) Also called 
plant caddies and plant trolleys, these low platforms roll on heavy-duty cast-
ers, making it a snap to move containers, both indoors and out.
Raising containers for accessibility
Containers allow gardeners of all ages and 
abilities to enjoy the wonders of growing plants. 
Raised containers — either large containers or 
smaller ones placed on stands — reduce the 
need to reach and bend and make it possible 
to perform all gardening chores from a sitting 
position or from a wheelchair. Placing contain-
ers on a smooth surface with plenty of room for 
maneuvering makes them even more acces-
sible. For more information on accessible gar-
dening, turn to Chapter 21.

I
n the garden, plants depend on soil to provide them with a means of 
support — a place for roots to anchor — and a storehouse for nutrients, 
oxygen, and moisture. Plants growing in containers need the same things, but 
because their roots are growing in a confined space, their needs are more 
exacting.
If you want to do all your container planting with bags of soil mix bought at 
the garden center — without having any idea what’s in the blend — you can 
count on reasonably good results. You really don’t need to read this chapter.
But if you want to understand what plants need and why, the place to start 
is at ground level. The more you understand about soil and how it influences 
plant growth, the better equipped you are to choose and maintain the ideal 
soil mix for plants. Are you curious now? If so, keep reading.
Why Soil Matters
Growing healthy plants starts with building healthy soil. Although it may 
look inert (except for the occasional earthworm), garden soil is teeming with 
life. In this complex, underground ecosystem, microorganisms like bacteria 
and fungi are constantly breaking down organic matter, releasing nutrients 
that plants need in the process. Critters large and small are tunneling, open-
ing up pathways that allow air and water to move. Building healthy soil in 
the garden usually involves adding organic matter like compost to feed soil 
microbes and adjusting soil pH to its optimal level (more on those later in 
this chapter).

42
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Why is soil so critical? Because of roots. While we sit back and applaud the 
flowers and foliage that grow above the rim of the pot, it’s the roots that are 
really supporting the show and that deserve our accolades. Roots work con-
stantly to find the right amount of air, moisture, and nutrients in the soil to 
fuel the flowers and foliage above.
 
In the ground, a plant’s roots may extend dozens or even hundreds of feet to 
find what they need. In contrast, the roots of a plant in a container must find 
everything within the confines of the pot. That’s why providing the right soil 
mix is the most important thing you can do to ensure the success of your con-
tainer plants.
A Quick Primer on Soil
Your local garden center may have half a dozen or more types of soil mixes 
labeled for container growing. They go by different names — seed-starting mix, 
soil-less mix, potting soil, topsoil. To make sense of all the different soil mixes, 
called growing media by horticulturists, it helps to understand some of the 
lingo used to describe soil. We give you the basics in the following sections.
Getting a feel for soil texture
Healthy garden soils contain a mixture of water, air, and solids (mineral par-
ticles and organic matter, or humus). The relative percentages of the mineral 
particles — sand, silt, or clay — determine the soil’s texture. Here’s a closer 
look at all three components:
 
✓ Sand: This gritty stuff is larger in size than the other two soil particles. 
Sandy soils drain well and dry out quickly, but they’re unable to hold 
nutrients. When you try to form sand into a ball, it crumbles and won’t 
hold its shape.
 
✓ Clay: These particles are so fine that they can be seen individually only 
with an electron microscope. Clay soils are sticky to the touch and drain 
slowly. They’re high in nutrients, but the nutrients often occur in forms 
that are unsuitable for plants. Clay feels slippery to the touch and holds 
its shape when you roll it into a ball.
 
✓ Silt: Silt is similar to clay, but the individual particles are much larger, mod-
erating its characteristics. It holds water and nutrients longer than sand, 
but not as tightly as clay. Dry silt feels like flour. Moist silt feels smooth but 
not sticky and holds its shape fairly well when rolled into a ball.
Most garden soils are composed of a combination of all three particles, in 
varying proportions.

43
 Chapter 4: Getting the Dirt on Soil Mixes
Making sense of soil structure
The way in which a soil’s mineral particles group together determines the 
soil structure. Healthy soil with good soil structure looks a little like crumbled 
chocolate cake. It’s moist and airy at the same time and contains different-
sized clumps. Compare this with a powdery cake mix, representing soil with 
poor structure, and you get a sense of what soil structure is all about. Soil 
scientists call the little clumps aggregates, and they’re one of the keys to a 
healthy soil.
Organic matter that’s in the process of decomposition and humus, the end 
product of that decomposition, are the “glue” that helps hold soil particles 
together into aggregates. Organic matter also acts as a reservoir of nutri-
ents and feeds soil organisms that, in turn, slowly release nutrients in forms 
plants can use. Organic matter performs magic in the soil: It helps sandy soils 
hold moisture and it helps clay soils drain better.
 
When a soil has good structure, it has plenty of spaces for air and water, and 
lots of room for plant roots to grow in the spaces between the soil aggregates. 
A soil with good structure retains water without becoming waterlogged and 
contains a balance of the nutrients necessary for plant growth — exactly what 
you want when choosing a container soil mix.
 
Although it seems to make sense that a good soil in the garden has all the right 
stuff to make it a good soil in a pot or planter, it just isn’t so. Soils that are ter-
rific in the field are not so great when put in containers. When the soil is lifted, it 
loses its structure. And as garden soil settles in a shallow container (much differ-
ent from the natural depth of the soil in a field), it forms a dense, poorly draining 
mass. Plus, garden soil may harbor disease-causing organisms that can devas-
tate container plantings and it often contains unwelcome weed seeds.
Choosing sweet or sour 
soil: A word about pH
No discussion of soil science can be complete without a mention of pH, or 
the relative sweetness (alkalinity) or sourness (acidity) of the soil. The pH is 
measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A soil pH below 7 is con-
sidered acidic, while one above 7 is alkaline.
The pH scale is logarithmic. That means that each unit represents a power of 
ten. Soil with a pH of 5 is ten times more acidic than soil with a pH of 6.
The reason a soil’s pH is important for plants is that some nutrients are avail-
able for uptake by a plant’s roots only when the pH is within a specific range. 

44
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
The ideal pH for most plants is 6 to 7, though a few plants (such as acid-
loving rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, and some perennials) prefer a 
slightly lower pH.
Kits for determining pH are readily available in most garden centers, and 
they’re probably all you need for testing soil or your own potting mixes. For 
the definitive word on a soil’s chemistry and makeup, you can order a profes-
sional test. Check with your local Cooperative Extension office for more infor-
mation or for addresses of reputable soil-testing labs.
 
When buying commercial soil mixes for container plants, you don’t have to 
worry about pH. Mixes in bags are formulated to the correct pH for most 
plants. Special mixtures are available for ferns, azaleas, or woodland plants 
that prefer a more acidic soil. If you decide to prepare your own mix, be sure 
to bring the pH to the right level for the plants you’re growing.
Old soil mixes — Don’t use them!
Soil mixes get worn out when they’re exposed to the elements and when plants 
are grown in them. The organic matter degrades, the mix becomes compacted, 
and the nutrients get used up. Disease spores and insects find their way in, 
too. Plants growing in containers need a top-notch soil mix to grow their best. 
When it’s time to replant a container, dump old mix into the garden or com-
post bin and start with fresh soil mix. Your plants will thank you!
What to Look for in a Container Soil Mix
Whether they’re growing in the ground or in containers, plants need the 
same things — air, water, and nutrients. But because the nature of garden 
soil changes when you confine it in a pot, it’s important to use a soil mix spe-
cifically formulated for containers. If you take a look at the ingredients on a 
bag of soil mix, you may notice that there’s very little, if any, real soil listed. 
The following sections give you a rundown of the characteristics of a good 
soil mix for containers.
Good water flow, optimal drainage, 
and moisture retention
In garden soil, water is pulled down to the roots by gravity, capillary action, 
and the attraction of small clay particles. The water keeps moving down 
through the soil in a continuous column. Because the soil in a container is 

45
 Chapter 4: Getting the Dirt on Soil Mixes
so confined and the soil column (depth of soil) is relatively shallow, this flow 
is impeded. The soil mix needs to have a looser structure to encourage this 
flow of water.
Good water flow helps excess water drain from the soil. Remember, plant 
roots need both water and oxygen. If the soil they’re growing in is saturated, 
there’s no room for oxygen. If it remains too wet for too long, the roots will 
begin to drown and rot, and if enough roots die the entire plant will die, too. 
For healthy plant growth water must move through the soil, moistening it 
without leaving it waterlogged.
On the other hand, you don’t want all the water to run right through the soil 
and out the drainage hole. Plant roots need a consistent supply of both water 
and oxygen. They can’t go without one or the other for very long. A soil mix 
that dries out too quickly multiplies your watering chores. Like we do in so 
many other facets of life, we’re looking for a balance — in this case between 
drainage and water retention. In a nutshell: The ideal soil mix drains freely 
but also retains some moisture.
 
You may have been told to put a layer of pea gravel or pot shards in the 
bottom of your container to improve drainage. Don’t do it! Although it may 
sound logical, using pea gravel in the bottom of a pot actually results in less 
air for the plant’s roots because it shortens the soil column. Instead, fill the 
entire container with the same soil mix, covering the drainage holes at the 
bottom with screening to hold in the soil as needed.
Plenty of pore space
One of the ways a soil mix can both drain freely and also retain moisture is 
by having both large and small pores (macropores and micropores). When the 
mix is watered, the water drains quickly through the macropores but is held 
in the micropores. The pores are in between individual soil particles, and also 
between the soil aggregates — those little clumps of particles described earlier 
in the chapter. Picture a water glass filled with ping pong balls. There are big 
spaces in between the balls — those represent macropores. Now imagine a 
glass filled with small marbles. The spaces between the marbles — representing 
micropores — are smaller than the spaces between the ping pong balls. Mix 
the ping pong balls and marbles in a single glass, and you see that the spaces 
around them vary in size. In a soil mix, the larger the pores the more quickly 
water will drain through and the less water will remain behind.
Don’t worry; you don’t need to know the specific pore spaces of different 
soil mixes. Just know that a mix formulated for plants that need excellent 
drainage and tolerate dry soil, like cactuses, will have plenty of macropores. 
That means this soil mix will also be a good choice for other plants that need 
excellent drainage — succulents like agave and sempervivum (“hens and 

46
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
chicks”), for example. If you’re growing plants like rosemary and lavender 
that need very good drainage but more moisture than cactuses, you may 
combine a cactus mix 50:50 with a regular soil mix. Now that you understand 
the principles you can mix and match soil mixes to suit the plants you’re 
growing.
Lack of contamination
Container mixes need to be free of diseases, insects, and weed seeds. Garden 
soil loses out on all counts for container planting. In the garden ecosystem, 
beneficial microbes help keep harmful ones in check. Placing garden soil in a 
container disrupts this balance. You can pasteurize the soil with heat to kill 
disease organisms, but this is not an easy task and the odor produced by the 
process is not pleasant.
With garden soil, you’re also getting insects in various stages of development 
as well as weed seeds, both of which can flourish in the environment of many 
container plantings. Rather than use backyard garden soil, commercial nurs-
ery growers (and most gardeners) now turn to soil-less mixes as a basis for 
their container potting mixtures. The concepts — drainage, moisture reten-
tion, and so on — are the same, only the ingredients differ. Read on for more 
information about this concept.
Bring On the Soil Mixes 
(For Peat’s Sake)
The movement away from real soil in potting mixes in this country began 
more than 60 years ago, in an attempt to eliminate the soil diseases that were 
plaguing the nursery industry and to find an alternative to topsoil, which 
was being lost to urbanization and herbicide contamination. Today, you can 
find dozens of variations of soil-less “soil mixes” for sale in your local plant 
nursery or big-box store, as well as some that list soil as an ingredient. The 
term soil mix is used as a catch-all term to describe the brown stuff you put 
in your containers and plant your plants in — whether or not it contains any 
actual soil.
In the following sections, you find out what ingredients go into soil mixes. We 
also give you some pointers on matching soils, plants, and containers, as well 
as tips on buying and storing soil mixes, modifying a store-bought soil, and 
mixing your own.

 Chapter 4: Getting the Dirt on Soil Mixes
Unearthing the contents of soil mixes
The soil mixes that you find on the shelves of your local nursery, garden 
center, or superstore today are based on a combination of organic and min-
eral components.
The following list gives a sampling of what you may find in different mixes:
 
✓ Charcoal: Charcoal is used to absorb toxic agents in the mix.
 
✓ Coir fiber: A by-product of the coconut industry, coir is typically 
shipped in compressed bricks, which expand when wetted. Coir is some-
times used as an eco-friendly alternative to sphagnum peat moss (see 
the bullet “Sphagnum peat moss” later in this list for more info).
 
✓ Dolomitic limestone: Added to peat-based mixes, it corrects the acidity 
of the peat. It also supplies some calcium and magnesium to plants.
 
✓ Organic matter: Organic matter consists of decomposed vegetative 
matter, such as composted wood products (pine bark or wood shav-
ings) and aged manure. It adds nutrients, beneficial microorganisms, 
and weight. It also holds moisture and may have disease-suppressive 
qualities. The quality of organic matter varies widely.
 
✓ Perlite: The roundish, whitish bits you see in soil mixes are perlite. 
Perlite is a granite-like volcanic rock that pops like popcorn and expands 
to 20 times its original volume when heat treated at 1500 to 2000 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Unlike vermiculite (see the “Vermiculite” bullet later in this 
list), perlite doesn’t absorb water. It improves drainage and aerates and 
lightens soil mixes.
 
✓ Rock powders: Greensand and crushed granite provide slowly released 
nutrients and may be a useful addition to permanent plantings.
 
✓ Sand: Washed, screened sand (often called builders’ sand) primarily 
adds weight to the mix and aids water flow.
 
✓ Sphagnum peat moss: A high-quality peat, sphagnum peat moss acts 
like a sponge when moistened, retaining water while also aerating the 
mix and improving drainage. It’s a basic component of soil-less mixes.
 
 Some people worry that sphagnum peat moss is being harvested at 
an unsustainable pace. It’s true that vast expanses of peat-rich land in 
Europe have already been harvested, much of it for use as fuel. Most 
sphagnum peat moss now comes from bogs in Canada using sustainable 
practices, according to the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association. 
Coir (see the “Coir fiber” bullet earlier in this list) is sometimes used as 
a more environmentally friendly ingredient in soil-less mixes because it’s 
a by-product of coconut production.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
✓ Topsoil: Topsoil may be found in soil-based potting mixes. It adds 
weight to the mix and provides nutrients.
 
✓ Vermiculite: Vermiculite is composed of processed mineral flakes that 
expand to 20 times their original volume under heat treatment. It retains 
water and aerates the mix. Vermiculite breaks down more quickly than 
perlite (see the earlier bullet for more on perlite).
 
✓ Water-absorbing polymer: These crystals absorb many times their 
weight in water, slowly releasing it back to plants as the soil mix dries. 
They help maintain even soil moisture and reduce watering chores. See 
Chapter 15 for more on these polymers.
 
✓ Wetting agents: Wetting agents are used to help wet peat moss, which is 
naturally water-resistant when dry. Note that some wetting agents aren’t 
approved for use in organic growing.
Some container mixes also contain synthetic or organic fertilizers to give 
plants an initial boost. Turn to Chapter 16 for more on fertilizers.
Look on the label of a potting mix described as organic, and you may find a 
fascinating array of ingredients, such as shrimp meal, bat guano, earthworm 
castings, crushed oyster shells, kelp (seaweed), feather, fish, and bone meal, 
and even beneficial microbes. These materials are added to improve the 
structure of the mix as well as add sources of nutrients. However, even if you 
start off with a mix containing lots of organic matter, you may need to apply 
additional nutrients throughout the growing season. You can find out more 
about plant nutrients in Chapter 16.
Choosing the right soil mix
Picking the most appropriate mix for your planting needs depends on know-
ing what you want to grow. For starting your own plants from seed or grow-
ing in very small (under 4-inch) pots, for example, you’re best off buying 
seed-starting mix or germinating mix. These mixes are screened to be very 
fine, which makes them ideal for starting small seeds. But they’re not a good 
choice for growing plants in larger containers through the season because 
they hold too much water and eventually compact, providing too little air for 
good long-term root growth.
For container gardening in hanging baskets or medium-size containers, you 
need a coarser mix that has better porosity, sometimes labeled general-purpose 
mix. These formulations often include composted bark for better drainage.
Larger containers that hold large shrubs or small trees require an even 
heavier mix (to anchor the pot and keep it from blowing over), but one with 
adequate drainage and air space for root growth. Such mixtures, sometimes 

49
 Chapter 4: Getting the Dirt on Soil Mixes
labeled nursery mix, often have sand and composted bark added to the peat 
mix. Some also include high-quality topsoil.
Also look for soil mixes formulated for plants that require specific conditions: 
African violets, bulbs, cactus, orchids, and others.
Buying and storing soil mixes
You can find soil mixes at most places that sell potted plants, including nurs-
eries, garden centers, and big-box stores. Soil mixes for container growing 
are sold in plastic bags, either loose (in a size range from 1 quart up to 40 
pounds) or in compressed bales (weighing about 70 pounds). Compressed 
bales yield almost twice the volume on the label when you dig out the mix 
and fluff it up. If you have a large number of plants to pot, buying the bales 
can be more economical than purchasing individual smaller bags of mix.
Whatever you buy, keep the bag tightly closed (so it doesn’t dry out or 
become infected with disease organisms) and protected from rain. The plas-
tic covering on commercial-size bags and bales is usually treated with ultra-
violet light inhibitors, giving the material about a one-year shelf life when 
stored out in the open. You can store the mix in an enclosed shed or in a dry, 
well-aired basement, though, if you want to keep it for more than one season.
Doctoring up a mix
Professional nurseries often buy wholesale mixtures of a general peat-based 
growing mix and then customize it to meet their needs. You can do the same 
thing. For example, you can save money by purchasing a large bale of com-
pressed seed-starting mix at the beginning of the season. Use as much as you 
need to start seeds; then, when it’s time to grow plants in larger pots, mix in 
some sterilized compost (or composted manure or composted bark mulch) 
to add nutrients and lighten the mix. If you’re growing trees and shrubs 
in containers, mix in some builder’s sand or purchased topsoil for added 
weight.
You can also add fertilizers to a mix. Slow-release formulas, such as 
Osmocote, that break down and release nutrients when they’re exposed to 
water are a common choice. Organic options include kelp, alfalfa, and fish 
meals, which break down slowly, releasing their nutrients to plant roots. You 
can find out more about slow-release fertilizers in Chapter 16.
 
If you add garden soil to your potting mixture, you run the risk of introducing 
disease-causing organisms to your container mixture. For best results, use 
only bagged, commercial topsoil, not the backyard garden fare.

Getting into the nitty-gritty: 
Mixing your own
With a little knowledge of what to look for, you can’t really go wrong with 
buying a commercial mix. If you can’t find a growing mix that suits your 
needs, however, and you really want to get down and dirty, you can mix your 
own blend. If you decide to take this route, be aware that you may need to 
experiment to achieve just the right mix.
Here’s a recipe that creates one cubic yard of mix. A cubic yard is a pile mea-
suring 3' by 3' by 3'. That’s a lot of mix! You can make a smaller amount as 
long as you maintain the proportions.
First combine the following:
1⁄2 cubic yard of sphagnum peat moss
1⁄2 cubic yard of vermiculite
Dump the ingredients in a pile on a smooth, clean surface like a concrete 
patio or driveway, or on a plastic tarp where you won’t contaminate the mix 
(for smaller proportions, use a wheelbarrow or garden cart). Break up the 
peat moss as needed so it isn’t clumped. Mix, adding warm water as neces-
sary to lightly moisten the material, and continue mixing until thoroughly 
combined.
Now add:
10 pounds bone meal
5 pounds dolomitic limestone
5 pounds blood meal
Mix thoroughly. If you don’t plan to use the mix immediately, store it tightly 
closed in plastic garbage bags or in a clean plastic garbage can.

pes,” visit the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service’s Web page

Y
ou have your container (see Chapter 3) and your soil mix (Chapter 4). 
What’s next? Planting, of course.
In this chapter we tell you how to identify a healthy plant at your local nurs-
ery. We also cover the essential tools you need when potting plants, and 
finally, we give you basic planting techniques that work for most plants and 
pots. For more specialized information, refer to Parts II and III.
What You Need to Know Before Planting
If you’re new to gardening, a trip to the garden center can be overwhelming. 
There are so many types of plants sold in so many different ways! This sec-
tion helps you navigate your way through the aisles so you can feel confident 
you’re choosing the best plant. If you’re an experienced in-ground gardener, 
you can probably skip this section and jump down to our step-by-step guide 
to planting. However, read on and you may just find some nuggets of wisdom! 
In the following sections, we explain the plant types you’ll find when you go 
shopping for your container plants, and then we give you advice on what to 
look for in a plant so you’re sure to bring home a healthy one.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Seeing how plants are sold
Transplants are the most popular choice for containers. These seedlings of 
annual flowers, vegetables, and, occasionally, perennial flowers are usually 
grown by large wholesalers and sold at local garden centers in cell-packs and 
small pots (up to 3 or 4 inches or so). They’ve been growing for six weeks 
or more, giving you a jump on the growing season. Although transplants are 
the most sought-after plants for containers, you can buy plants several other 
ways as well:
 
✓ Seeds: Mail-order catalogs and nursery racks offer seeds of countless 
varieties of annuals and perennials, and even some trees and shrubs. 
Growing plants from seeds takes time, but offers one of the most reward-
ing ways to garden. Not only is it fun to watch a tiny seed sprout into a 
beautiful plant, but you also find a much larger variety of plants sold as 
seeds as compared with transplants. Some plants are easier and faster 
to grow from seed than others; look to “If at First You Want to Seed” 
later in this chapter to find out more and get seed-starting advice.
 
✓ Bulbs: Most bulbs grow well in containers, especially if you’re growing 
them for a single season. You can order from catalogs or check your 
local nursery in fall and spring. See Chapter 9 for details.
 
✓ Container-grown plants: Shrubs and trees, along with some larger annu-
als and perennials, are offered in familiar quart, 1-gallon, 5-gallon, and 
15-gallon plastic pots or, occasionally, paper pulp pots. Their large size 
and advanced stage of growth provide instant gratification.
 
✓ Bare-root: Deciduous trees and shrubs, especially fruit-bearing types 
and roses, are typically sold bare-root when they’re dormant and leaf-
less. (Many perennials also are sold bare-root, particularly by mail-
order companies.) The plants are dug from growing fields, and their 
roots are washed of soil, then packed in moist newspaper or peat moss. 
Although they may look dead upon arrival, don’t worry: Their survival 
rate is high as long as the roots don’t dry out. If you can’t plant them 
right away, store bare-root plants in a cool, dark place and keep the 
packing material moist.
 
 Bare-root is one of the more economical ways to buy good-sized plants, 
and it’s a sure way to start plants off right: You can ensure that roots are 
properly spread out in the right growing medium.
 
✓ Balled and burlapped: Evergreen shrubs and trees, along with decidu-
ous types that can’t be successfully handled bare-root, are dug from 
growing fields with a ball of soil around the roots. Then they’re wrapped 
with burlap and sometimes an outer wire basket. Because field soil is 
so heavy, balled and burlapped plants can be difficult to transport and 
plant but usually offer good results.

53
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
Choosing healthy plants
The longer you garden, the better you become at recognizing healthy plants 
that are ready to take off for a long and productive life in a container. Here 
are some general signs to keep in mind:
 
✓ Younger is often better than older, smaller better than bigger. The 
longer plants stay in nursery containers, the more likely they are to 
become root-bound, where roots become overcrowded and begin to 
circle around the sides of the container.
 
 Don’t hesitate to gently slip plants out of their containers and look for 
white roots woven through dark soil, rather than a tight tangle of dark 
roots and little loose soil.
 
✓ Deep green is better than yellow or a dull color — realizing, of course, 
that we’re not talking about plants that naturally have yellow foliage or 
dull leaves.
 
✓ Look for plenty of young, healthy new growth rather than lots of woody 
branches.
The following sections provide specific pointers for the different categories 
of plants to help you select healthy specimens.
Annual flowers
Look for short, stocky plants with healthy green foliage. Bare lower stems, 
floppy growth, and yellowing leaves indicate the plant may not have been 
watered or fertilized properly. The size of the plant should be in proportion 
to the pot. Large plants in small cell packs are almost certainly root-bound 
and probably have been kept alive on a diet of constant watering and fertil-
izing. They’ll adapt poorly, if at all, to a new container.
What about annuals in bloom? To make seedlings as appealing as possible for 
sale at the nursery, plant breeders tinker with genes and growers use special 
techniques to create plants that pop into bloom at an early age, sometimes 
before the plant is strong enough to support the energy-intensive bloom-
ing process. The result is a plant that blooms for a few days when you get 
it home, and then goes into foliage- and root-growing mode for a few weeks 
until it’s strong enough to bloom again. Look for plants with healthy green 
foliage and perhaps a few buds, rather than annuals in full flower.
Vegetables and herbs
Much of the advice on annual flowers holds true for vegetables and herbs. 
Avoid plants in small containers that sport flowers or developing fruit (toma-
toes, peppers, squash, and so on), because premature flowering and fruiting 

54
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
are signs that the plant has been stressed. Plants in gallon-sized or larger 
containers may be further along in development; however, transplanting 
them may cause enough stress that they drop their flowers and fruit anyway.
Bulbs
Look for firm bulbs that show no signs of rot. A loose tunic — the papery 
outer covering — is usually fine, but soft spots are definitely trouble. Bulbs 
that haven’t yet sprouted are preferable to those with growing shoots.
Perennials
Most perennial plants are sold in quart- and gallon-sized containers. At this 
size, they’ve probably been growing for at least a year, if not longer. If you’re 
buying plants in early spring, the top growth may still be small. Pop the 
plants out of their pots and look for healthy white roots coursing through 
the soil mix. A dense, tangled mass of roots often indicates the plants have 
been growing too long in the same pot and should have been transplanted 
to a larger container. Few or no visible roots in a container-grown plant may 
indicate that the plant has just been repotted in a larger container and hasn’t 
developed a healthy root system yet. Unfortunately, if you can’t see the roots 
you can’t tell if the plant is adapting well to its new pot so it’s best to avoid 
plants that have no signs of roots in the soil. Some perennials are sold bare-
root in early spring (see more on bare-root plants in the next two sections).
Shrubs and trees
When buying shrubs and trees, avoid the temptation to buy the largest size. 
Instead, look for thick branching and sturdy, well-shaped plants (as opposed 
to one-sided growth). Inspect for vigorous new growth at the branch tips and 
healthy bark with no wounds, deep scars, or splits. In general, small trees 
and shrubs adapt more readily to their new growing conditions than larger 
ones, often catching up to or outpacing larger trees planted at the same time.
 
Most importantly, avoid a root-bound plant. If the roots fill the container and 
are circling the sides, the plant is seriously root-bound and may never settle 
properly into its new home.
When shopping for bare-root trees and shrubs, look for plump, firm, moist 
roots. Avoid plants with shriveled, dry, and brittle roots. Likewise, avoid 
plants with mushy, moldy roots or those that smell foul, indicating decay. 
Ideally, bare-root plants should be kept in a cool, moist place; plants that 
have been out in a store display may prematurely sprout — this isn’t ideal, 
but it’s not necessarily a cause for rejection.
With balled and burlapped plants, check for splits in the ball of soil, which 
can cause roots to dry out. Make sure that the soil ball hasn’t dried out 
because remoistening it thoroughly can be difficult.

55
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
Fruits and berries
Often sold bare-root in early spring, fruit and berry plants should be fully 
dormant, with no sprouts or developing leaves. If you can’t plant them right 
away, store them in a cool, dark place and keep packing material moist.
Houseplants
The same overall rules apply when choosing houseplants. Look for healthy 
new growth, an attractive shape, healthy roots, and a plant that is in propor-
tion to its pot.
 
Examine plants carefully for signs of insects or disease before purchasing 
them. Some gardeners go so far as to quarantine new plants, keeping them 
separate from other plants for a week or two to be sure they’re pest-free.
Your Well-Stocked Planting Tool Kit
Here’s a quick checklist to make sure that you have all the tools you need 
before you start planting:
Hardening off
Plants purchased straight from a greenhouse 
benefit from a short period of hardening off, 
which simply means gradually acclimating 
them to their new surroundings. Plants grown 
in greenhouses are accustomed to warmth, 
high humidity, and protection from direct sun 
and wind. You can harden off plants before 
or after planting them in their new containers. 
Here’s how:
 1. As soon as you get seedlings home, place 
them in a bright, protected place in part 
shade, and water them well. Keep them 
there for a few days, moving them indoors 
at night if temperatures drop to below 50 
degrees Fahrenheit.
 2. After a day or two, move them to full sun 
for a few hours, gradually increasing their 
exposure to sun, wind, and cool tempera-
tures over the course of a week to 10 days.
 3. Place plants in their new home, keeping 
an eye out for signs of sunburn (which 
looks like bleached areas) or chill damage 
(which often appears as blackened areas), 
both of which usually show up on the 
upper, exposed leaves. If inner leaves are 
also affected, the plants may have another 
problem — turn to Chapter 18.
Hardening off also gives you a chance to keep 
an eye on plants for pest problems.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
✓ Container: Double-check to make sure it’s the right size (see Chapter 3 
and Parts II and III).
 
✓ Potting mix: Choose a potting mix appropriate for the plants (see 
Chapter 4).
 
✓ Drain hole cover: Cut a piece of window screen large enough to cover 
the drainage hole(s).
 
✓ Shears and knife: You may need to cut up root-bound roots or trim top 
growth a bit.
 
✓ Scoop or trowel: Use this to move soil mix. You may want a shovel for 
big jobs.
 
✓ Gloves: Handling soil dries out your hands, and you may want leather, 
cloth, or rubber gloves to protect them.
 
✓ Water: Your plant needs it as soon as you plant it. Use a watering can or 
hose (a bubbler attachment helps soften the flow). Room-temperature 
water is best.
 
✓ Miscellaneous: Stakes, plant ties, trellis — anything else you may need 
right after planting.
A Step-by-Step Guide to Planting 
a Basic Container
Follow these steps to plant most shrubs, trees, annuals, and perennials in 
most of your standard containers. Later in this chapter we give you planting 
tips for different types of containers. Refer to Parts II and III for details on 
specific types of plants.
1. Getting the container ready
Make sure that the container is the right size for your plants (see Chapter 3 
for specifics). For permanent plants, choose a container that’s 2 inches 
wider and deeper than the nursery container, as shown in Figure 5-1. Bare-
root plants need a container that’s several inches wider and deeper than the 
stretched-out, trimmed-up roots. Annuals and perennials can be crowded 
together more closely in containers than in the ground. Refer to Parts II and 
III for more details.
 
Some containers need a bit of preparation. Soak new terra-cotta pots in water 
for 10 or 15 minutes before planting to prevent clay from drawing moisture 
out of the soil mix.

57
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
If you’re using old pots, you may want to clean them as we describe in 
Chapter 17 to remove salt deposits and reduce chances of disease. And, as 
logic dictates, applying preservative to wood containers before you plant is 
easier than doing so afterwards (see Chapter 17 for how-tos).

Most commercially made pots have drain holes to allow water to flow out of 
the container. Often these holes are so large that they allow soil to flow out 
with the water. To prevent this, use a piece of window screen large enough to 
cover the hole, as shown in Figure 5-2.

If your container lacks a drain hole, you need to make one. Drilling holes in the 
base of a wooden box is easy: Drill one ½-inch hole for a box up to 12 square 
inches; two to four ½-inch holes for larger boxes or a half barrel. For clay pots, 
use an electric drill with a masonry bit. Support the pot on a block of wood, 
and start drilling with a smaller bit, eventually reaching the final size of ½ inch. 
Adding water to the drill hole may help.
2. Preparing the soil mix
Many peat-based soil mixes are bone dry in the bag, and moistening them 
before planting is vital. Pour enough mix to fill your container into a pail. (If 
you’re using the whole bag, you can moisten it right in the bag.) Now’s the 
time to mix in a slow-release fertilizer; see Chapter 16 for details. Pour warm 
water over the mix, stirring as you go. Let the water soak in for at least a half-
hour, stirring the mix occasionally and adding more water as needed so the 
moisture is evenly distributed. (You may be surprised at how much water 
you have to add to moisten dry peat moss.)
 
Strive for the moisture level of a wrung-out sponge — damp, but not sopping 
wet. The soil mix should be moist enough that you can form it into a loose ball 
in your hand. If your soil mix comes out of the bag this moist, you can skip 
this step.
3. Prepping the plant
Whatever the plant’s original residence — nursery pot, cell-pack, or paper 
pulp pot — you need to pay attention to a few key matters before you start 
the actual planting.
First, make sure that the nursery plant’s soil is moist enough to hold the 
roots together when you plant. If the soil is dry, give it a good soaking and let 
it drain for at least an hour. Place bare-root plants in a bucket of water for an 
hour or so before planting.
Next, you need to remove the plant from the nursery container. Here are 
some tips for getting plants out of their pots:
 
✓ Plastic cell-packs: Turn the pack upside down and wiggle and squeeze 
the base of each cell. Gently tug on the plant, holding it by the leaves 
rather than the stem. (If a leaf breaks, others will grow; if the stem 
breaks, the plant’s a goner.) If the plant resists coming out of the cell, 
use scissors to cut the plastic off.

59
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
 
✓ Small pots: Support the root ball by placing your hand over the soil sur-
face with the stem between your fingers, as shown in Figure 5-3. Turn the 
plant over and tap on the pot to loosen the root ball. If it sticks, squeeze 
or gently shake it, or, if necessary, use scissors to cut away the pot.
 
✓ Larger containers, such as 1- and 5-gallon pots: Tip a plastic container 
on its side or upside down, taking care not to break branches, and let 
the root ball slip out, catching it with one hand. If the root ball doesn’t 
slip out easily, tap the rim of the upside-down container on a hard sur-
face. If the root ball really resists, cut off the pot with shears, taking care 
not to damage the roots. Paper pulp pots can be treated like plastic — 
they’re easy to cut apart if plants resist slipping out.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Getting a 
plant out 
of a plastic 
container.
 
After the plant is free from its original pot, inspect the root ball. Is it root-
bound? Do roots protrude from the drain hole? Or are roots twined around 
into a dense mass that repels water? For small plants, such as annuals, that 
may be a bit root-bound, gently loosen the mat of roots with your fingertips. 
For larger plants, such as 1- or 5-gallon shrubs, use a knife to score some ver-
tical scratches in a tight root ball.
4. Planting
Start adding some moist soil mix to your container. Your goal is to end up 
with the soil about an inch below the rim of the container for small plants (2 
inches or more for large containers), so there’s enough space to hold plenty 
of water as you apply it. The amount of soil and planting technique varies for 
different types of plants:

60
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
✓ For small plants in cell packs or little pots: Fill the container almost 
to the level that you want to end up with. With your hands or trowel, 
scoop out a little hole for each root ball, slip in the plant, and firm down 
around its edges with your fingers. If the soil level starts to rise too high, 
remove some soil. Match the soil level to your plants’ previous growing 
conditions — don’t bury plants too deep or allow their root balls to rise 
above the soil level. Figure 5-4 shows the ideal position.
 
Figure 5-4: 
This one’s 
planted just 
right.
 
 
✓ For plants in gallon pots and larger: Place an inch or two of soil mix 
in the bottom of the container. Then place the plant in the container to 
see how much, if any, more soil you need to add to raise the plant to the 
desired height. Add enough soil mix to raise the top of the root ball to 
the desired level in the pot, usually 2 to 4 inches below the rim. Then 
set the root ball on top of the soil mix and begin filling in with more soil 
mix, tamping it down with your hands, a trowel, or a shovel handle for 
large containers. Tamping down is important to establish firm contact 
between the root ball and the new soil mix and to remove air pockets. 
Keep adding soil mix until it levels up with the top of the root ball.
 
✓ For balled and burlapped plants: Place the root ball on soil mix at the 
bottom of the container, just as you would for plants grown in 1- or 
5-gallon nursery pots (see the preceding bullet). Cut away the twine 
holding the burlap in place at the top of the root ball. Fold back and 
trim away the top several inches of burlap with heavy scissors or a 
knife. Then slash the remaining burlap down the sides to allow for 
root growth. The buried part gradually decomposes. (Make sure all 
the burlap is buried in the soil mix; any exposed burlap will wick water 
away from plant roots.) Fill with soil mix around the root ball, tamping 
it down as you go to remove air pockets, until it is level with the top of 
the root ball.

 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
 
 In the old days all burlap was biodegradable. Now, sometimes it’s made 
with plastic fibers or treated with chemicals to keep it from degrading. If 
this is the case or you’re unsure, gently cut away as much of the burlap 
as possible and remove it from the container.
 
✓ For bare-root plants: Remove the plant from the bucket where it has 
been soaking, and trim off any broken or damaged roots. Check the 
instructions that come with the plant for more specific pruning advice. 
Examine the plant to find the former soil line (usually indicated by 
a faint, discolored ring around the trunk). Mound the soil mix at the 
bottom of the container, spreading the roots evenly over the mound. 
Adjust the level of the mound until the plant’s soil line matches up with 
the desired soil level in the container. Fill around the roots and up to the 
soil line, tamping gently as you go.
5. Watering
Even though you’ve planted a well-watered plant into moist soil, you still 
need to water after planting to help soil settle around plant roots and elimi-
nate any remaining air pockets. Watering a just-planted container is trickier 
than you may imagine. Water tends to follow the path of least resistance, and 
drains quickly through the loose soil mix, bypassing the denser root ball. You 
walk away thinking that your watering job is done. Days later, you realize that 
the root ball never really got wet, and the plant is desiccated. Protect against 
this by watering thoroughly the first time.
 
The secret to successful watering is a slow and gentle stream. Drip irrigation 
or gently trickling hoses are ideal. Or, if you’re patient, apply water slowly 
using a watering can or a hose, taking care not to wash soil out of the con-
tainer. Slowly fill the pot to the rim, and repeat several times. Probe with your 
fingers to find out whether the root ball has absorbed water — if you don’t 
detect moisture, try soaking it again.
6. Finishing up
Just a few more steps and you’re done! The first two steps are universal; the 
last two apply only to certain types of plants:
 
✓ Apply mulch to improve the appearance, keep soil from washing away 
during watering, help conserve water, and keep weed seeds from sprout-
ing. Bark chips are decorative and help insulate the roots from hot sun. 
Some gardeners prefer the look of stone mulch, and it’s a fine choice, too.
 
✓ Hose off the container if it got muddy during the planting process.
 
✓ Stake and tie trees or tall annuals or perennials.
 
✓ Add a trellis to the container for vines that need support.

Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
Potting Plants in Specialized Containers
Special containers need special planting techniques, either because of their 
shape or the way they’ll be displayed. For example, you want lightweight soil 
and strategically placed plants in a container that you’ll mount on a wall or 
hang from a porch roof. Here’s a rundown of some of the more commonly 
available options.
Planting hanging baskets
Plastic baskets are the easiest to plant; wire baskets involve a few extra 
steps. (Refer to Chapter 3 for an explanation of different types of baskets.) 
Start by gathering all your materials together in a comfortable place to work.
Choosing a soil mix
A successful soil mix for hanging baskets has two characteristics. First, the 
mix needs to be lightweight. Second, the soil must retain moisture, because 
hanging baskets dry out faster than most other containers.
One way to achieve a suitable mix is to start with a bag of high-quality potting 
mix and add perlite or vermiculite at the ratio of three parts soil mix to one part 
additive. Perlite and vermiculite both lighten the mix; vermiculite also absorbs 
and retains water. Both are available at garden supply stores. Mixing in timed-
release fertilizer granules is a good idea, too. If hangers will be displayed in full 
sun, consider adding water-absorbing crystals, which absorb water and turn gel-
like, releasing moisture slowly as the soil dries. Add to the soil mix according to 
package directions. Refer to Chapter 4 for more on soil mixes and additives.
Planting a solid basket
The steps for planting a solid basket are similar to those for planting any 
small container:
 
1. Place a piece of window screen over the drain holes in the bottom of 
the basket.
 
2. Fill the container with potting mixture.
 
3. Plant the upright plants toward the center, firming the soil around them.
 
4. Add the fillers, if you have room for them, near the plants in the 
center, and finish with the spillers along the rim.
 
5. Hang and water the basket immediately.
 
6. Water daily for the first few days, and then ease off if the soil is stay-
ing moist.
 
 Step up watering if the weather turns hot and as the plant roots fill the 
basket.

63
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
Planting a wire basket lined with sphagnum moss
These popular baskets dry out quickly and require extra care, but will reward 
you with remarkable displays for your efforts. Baskets lined with flexible plas-
tic in place of the moss are planted using a similar technique.
 
1. Start by soaking sphagnum moss in water for at least 10 minutes.
 
 Support a round-bottomed basket on a large pot or bucket to keep it 
upright.
 
2. Begin to line your basket by laying sheets of dampened moss — about 
1 inch thick — along the bottom and halfway up the sides.
 
3. Loosely fill the basket with soil to just below the moss level, and then 
resume lining the sides with moss.
 
 Continue right up to the top until the moss covers the rim area, as 
shown in Figure 5-5. Use plenty of moss so you don’t have any gaps, and 
fill loosely with more soil until you reach the top.
 
4. Begin planting the sides by starting near the bottom, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
 
 Carefully open a space between the wires and through the moss. Loosen 
any tangled roots, and insert the roots through the hole and into the 
moist soil. Use more wads of moss to tuck the plant in securely, and 
gently bend the wires together above and below the plant.
 
5. Continue planting the sides.
 
 Allow at least 3 inches between plants as you stagger them evenly 
around the sides. The more plants you place here, the quicker things 
can grow together and the less basket you’ll see later on.

Figure 5-6:

planting 
from the 
bottom.
 
 
6. Plant in the top of the basket, as shown in Figure 5-7.
 
 Space plants evenly with the tallest in the center, allowing at least 3 
inches between plants. Set them so that the soil level is slightly below 
the rim. Again, the fuller you plant the top, the quicker your basket can 
become a mass of color and texture. Be careful not to plant right over 
the roots of side plants near the rim. Firm the top plants in, adding more 
soil as needed but keeping the level below the top of the moss.
 
7. Attach the supports and hang the basket.
 
8. Water gently and thoroughly until water drains freely.

After you’ve 
planted 
along the 
sides, you

65
 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
 
9. Replace any moss that may have fallen out, tucking new moss securely 
around the plants.
 
10. Water daily as plants become established.
Planting a strawberry 
pot or pocket planter
Strawberry jars and pocket planters have holes cut into the sides as well as an 
open top. They come in a range of sizes, but most jars have between 8 and 15 
pockets sized for small plants like herbs or annuals — or strawberries. Follow 
these easy steps for designing and planting an impressive strawberry jar:
 
1. Decide what you want to grow in the jar.
 
 You can plant herbs, strawberries, or small flowers. Or, you can mix 
sunny annuals with tasty herbs and have the best of two worlds.
 
2. Buy enough plants for all the pockets, including one to four plants for 
the mouth at the top.
 
 Six-pack plants are the ideal size for the side openings.
 
3. Decide where you want each plant to go.
 
 Alternating themes or repeating patterns work well if you don’t want a 
different plant in each slot.
 
4. Place a piece of window screen over the bottom drain hole, and add 
potting mix to the level of the lowest openings (see Figure 5-8).
 
Figure 5-8:

5. Carefully slip the roots through the opening, pulling from inside 
the jar.
 
6. Fill in with soil up to the level of each pocket as you plant, as shown 
in Figure 5-9.
 
 Firm soil around the roots, and pack it down around the plant in the 
mouth of each pocket. Repeat for all pockets.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Add soil 
to each 
pocket.
 
 
7. Plant the top of the jar with the remaining plants.
 
8. Immediately water the top and each pocket, and replace any soil that 
washes away (see Figure 5-10).

 Chapter 5: Putting It All Together: Planting Your Container Garden
Planting a window box or railing planter
You have three options for planting your window box or railing planter:
 
✓ You can plant directly in the container.
 
✓ You can drop in plants, pots and all, and fill around them with moss, 
bark, or another lightweight material.
 
✓ You can put plants in a plastic or metal liner that fits inside the box. With 
this method, you can rotate liners, removing a liner when the plants in it are 
past their prime and swapping in a liner with fresh plants. This technique 
is especially good if the planters are located in less-than-ideal conditions — 
too much shade, for example. You can swap liners in and out, rotating them 
to a sunnier spot every few weeks to rejuvenate the plants.
Basically, you plant the same way you do in any container. Cover the drain 
holes, fill with soil mixture, and firm soil around plants, leaving at least 1 inch 
at the top for watering.
If at First You Want to Seed
Very few types of plants do well if started from seeds sown directly in the 
containers where you want them to grow. Often, they just grow too slowly 
and are better off started indoors a month or two before being planted in the 
container. Some seedlings grow better if they’re started in small containers 
and then “moved up” — transplanted into gradually larger containers. They 
just don’t perform well if grown in an excessive amount of soil mix.
 
The following annual flower and vegetable seeds are good choices for direct 
sowing into large containers: beans, lettuce, marigolds, nasturtiums, sunflow-
ers, and zinnias. Follow seed packet directions for sowing in the ground.
You can easily start many types of seeds indoors and gradually transplant 
up to your final containers. Seed-starting kits and equipment are available at 
garden centers and in catalogs. Mainly, you need trays or flats, cell-packs, or 
other small containers, along with special seed-starting soil mix. Then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Fill containers to the top with moist, sterile, soil-less mix (see Chapter 4).
 
 Level the top by sweeping across it with your hand or a table knife.
 
2. Use your fingertip or a pencil to make small depressions for seeds.
 
 Seeding depth need not be exact, but try to plant your seeds at the 
depth recommended on the seed packet — usually about three times as 
deep as the seeds are wide.

68
Part I: Getting Started with Container Gardening 
 
3. Drop one or two seeds into each depression, cover with pinches of 
seed-starting mixture, and dampen thoroughly with plain water.
 
 To keep from flooding out the planted seeds, either use a pump spray 
bottle to mist the containers repeatedly, or place the containers in small 
pans or trays and fill the pans with 1 inch of water. The containers will 
absorb the water from the pans in about an hour.
 
4. To keep the surface of the planted containers from drying out, cover 
them lightly with plastic wrap or enclose the whole tray in a large 
plastic bag.
 
 Place the containers in a warm place.
 
5. Start checking for germination after three days.
 
 As soon as the first sprouts emerge, remove the plastic and move the 
seedlings to good light.
 
6. Thin your seedlings.
 
 Most of the time, you end up with way too many seedlings. If left alone, 
they become so crowded that they can’t grow well. Retain only one or 
two seedlings in a container that’s 2 inches across.
 
 To thin to the proper number, keep the strongest-looking ones, and 
use scissors to snip the others off at the soil line. (You can pull out the 
extra seedlings with your fingers or tweezers and gingerly transplant 
them to individual containers, but you risk damaging the roots of the 
remaining ones.)
 
7. When seedlings are about two weeks old, they’re ready for a little 
fertilizer.
 
 Use a fertilizer that can be mixed with water, and mix it at half the 
strength recommended on the package. Fertilize seedlings about once a 
week, or every other time you water them.
 
8. After four to six weeks, your seedlings are big enough to move 
outside.
 
 To help them get ready for the big move, spend a week or two hardening 
them off — refer to the sidebar earlier in this chapter for details.

of brilliant geraniums and petunias overflowing their 
containers, or if you have your heart set on harvesting 
your own sun-warmed, vine-ripened tomatoes, you’ve

W
hat’s the first thing that you think of when you picture container 
plants? Probably a hanging basket overflowing with annual flowers 
and maybe a tomato plant on the deck. If you’re new to container gardening, 
single-season plants like these are definitely the way to go.
In this chapter you find an overview of the types of plants suitable for single-
season containers, a rundown of the benefits of growing annuals in containers, 
information about making the most of seasonal weather, and some general 
information on mixing different types of plants in containers. The next three 
chapters go into details on growing annual flowers, vegetables and herbs, and 
bulbs in containers.
Evaluating Your Options
The plants used in single-season containers are often, but not always, annual 
plants. That’s because they tend to grow quickly and produce the desired 
result — flowers or edible parts — within months of planting.
Some perennial plants can be grown as annuals — they’ll just have a shorter 
lifespan than what nature originally intended. In the following sections, we 
explain the three categories of plants typically grown in single-season containers.

72
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Sizing up annuals
Botanically speaking, an annual (from the Latin annus, meaning year) is a 
plant that undergoes its life cycle in one growing season. For example, a mari-
gold or bean seed sprouts in the spring, grows quickly, blooms in summer, 
sets and disperses its seeds, and dies when frost hits in fall. The seeds sprout 
the next year to repeat the process. Contrast this with a perennial, which 
lives for at least a few years.
The nursery definition of annual is different, and in some ways more practi-
cal: Annuals are plants that gardeners purchase or sow in spring and enjoy 
for one growing season, with the expectation that they’ll need to replace 
them with fresh plants the following spring. (In mild climates, you can plant 
annuals in fall and winter — more on this later.)
What’s the difference in the definitions? Some plants that nurseries label as 
annuals are, botanically speaking, perennials that, in a suitable climate, will 
live for more than one year.
 
For your single-season containers, look for flowers labeled as annuals or bed-
ding plants. Most vegetables and herbs are suitable for container growing, too.
Perusing perennials that 
pretend to be annuals
If left in the ground in regions with mild winters, some plants that are sold as 
annuals will overwinter and resprout the following spring (meaning they’re 
actually perennials). The petunia is a classic example. Surprisingly, many of 
the most common so-called annuals are really perennials, including alyssum, 
bacopa, calibrachoa (also known as million bells), cleome, lantana, snap-
dragon, twinspur, and verbena. However, these plants won’t survive the cold 
winter temperatures that affect much of the country, so for most of us it’s 
perfectly reasonable to consider them annuals.
To further confuse the matter, some plants are biennials: They produce foli-
age their first season, then flowers and seeds the second season, after which 
they die. Several familiar vegetables and herbs are biennials, including car-
rots and parsley. However, gardeners usually harvest them during their first 
growing season, before they flower. Biennial flowers include foxglove, sweet 
William, and hollyhock; however, plant breeders have developed varieties of 
these that bloom their first growing season, blurring the distinction.

73
 Chapter 6: A Short but Sweet Relationship with Annuals
 
You can plant perennials in single-season containers; however, they may take 
longer to flower. If a perennial is already blooming when you buy it, it’s fine for 
a single-season planting.
Tending toward the tropical
Truly tropical plants won’t survive temperatures below freezing, and some 
may be damaged if temperatures dip into the 50s Fahrenheit. Begonia, coleus, 
impatiens, sweet potato vines, zonal and ivy geraniums — even peppers and 
tomatoes — are perennial in their native tropical to subtropical regions. 
They’ll overwinter in only the mildest climates, so for all practical purposes 
you can consider them annuals — unless you live in the tropics or want to 
overwinter them indoors.
Why Grow Single-Season Containers?
Why, you might wonder, would someone grow annuals — plants that must 
be replaced each year — instead of long-lived perennials? One reason is that 
some of the most beautiful and easiest to grow flowers are annuals. Plus, 
most vegetables and many herbs grow quickly and produce their harvest 
in one growing season. Then, at the end of the season you can discard the 
plants and start fresh next spring with the same old favorites or experiment 
with something new.
Contrast this with permanent plantings — perennials, trees, and shrubs — 
that need extra care if they’re to survive cold winter temperatures, even if 
those same plants are hardy when they’re growing in the ground. That means 
moving them to a sheltered spot or protecting them with a thick mulch and 
crossing your fingers that the plants survive.
The only downside to growing single-season containers is that you must 
replant each year, and that involves some effort and expense.
Matching Plants to the Season
For the most part, the plants your local nursery sells each season should 
withstand all but the most extreme seasonal conditions in your region of the 
country. But that doesn’t mean you can buy them the first week they’re for 
sale, plant them, set them outside, and expect them to thrive. Nurseries often 

74
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
display plants for sale weeks before the plants can tolerate the up-and-down 
temperatures of changing seasons.
So you have to know a little bit about the frost dates in your area and the 
plants’ preferred temperatures. The following sections help you out in both 
regards. (And if you want even more information about climate and container 
plantings, flip to Chapter 2.) We also introduce the idea of planting a con-
tainer so it looks good season after season.
Planting by the calendar
Before you plant, you need to know when your average last spring frost 
occurs (see Chapter 2 for more on frost dates). Ask a gardening neighbor, 
inquire at a local nursery, consult with your Cooperative Extension office, 
or take a look at the climate maps at www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/
freezefrost/frostfreemaps.html.
 
Keep in mind that this is only an average — if your average last spring frost 
is May 1, half the time the actual date is earlier than this and the other half 
it’s later.
Although the average last frost date isn’t exact, it does provide a good guide-
line for determining when you can set out frost-sensitive plants — just be 
prepared to protect them if a late cold spell threatens. You can set out frost-
tolerant plants a few weeks before your average last frost date. (See Chapter 2 
for ways to protect plants.)
 
Plants that have been raised in a greenhouse should be hardened off — slowly 
acclimated to outdoor conditions over the course of a week or 10 days. Flip to 
Chapter 5 for details.
Cool-season or heat lover?
Plants vary in their temperature preferences. Some, like larkspur and spin-
ach, are described as cool-season plants: They grow well in cool temperatures 
and tolerate light frosts, but begin to languish when summer heats up. At the 
other extreme are warm-season plants, like celosia and basil: They may suffer 
chill damage and stunted growth if temperatures drop below 45 degrees, but 
they love the sun and heat of midsummer.
Seed packets and plant tags usually provide information about a plant’s tem-
perature preferences, and we also include it in the plant descriptions in the 

75
 Chapter 6: A Short but Sweet Relationship with Annuals
next few chapters. When in doubt, assume a plant is vulnerable and don’t 
expose it to freezing temperatures.
Cool-season and warm-season are, of course, relative terms. Where summers 
are cool, like along the foggy California coast or in other overcast climates, 
you can grow cool-season plants all summer. Where winters are warm and 
nearly frost-free (as in low-elevation Arizona and much of California), fall 
through spring is an ideal stretch for growing cool-season plants like Iceland 
poppies and lettuce.
 
Truly tropical climates like those found in Hawaii and southern Florida are in 
a separate category and have their own special rules for growing annuals. We 
recommend checking with local nurseries for exact timing.
Success(ion) in planting
You can make the most of plants’ different temperature preferences with suc-
cession planting. Start out in spring with frost-tolerant, cool-season plants. By 
early summer when they begin to fade, replace them with heat-lovers. Come 
fall, as temperatures cool, go back to cool-season plants.
For example, sow spinach in early spring — it prefers cool temperatures and 
can tolerate frost. As the weather heats up in early summer, the spinach will 
begin to bolt (send up flower stalks) and get bitter tasting. Pull it out and 
plant a heat-loving crop, like beans. As the weather begins to cool in fall the 
bean harvest will slow; then it’s time to pull out the bean plants and go back 
to a cool-season crop.
The same concept holds true for flowers. Pansies are a classic early spring 
flower but will begin to flag in early summer. Replace the pansies with heat-
lovers, like zinnias. Come fall, it’s time to go back to pansies or another cool-
season flower.
This method is familiar to gardeners in regions with very hot summers, 
where fall planting is as common as spring planting and cool-season plants 
will grow all through the winter. However, gardeners everywhere can take 
advantage of different plants’ preferences. This is especially true for con-
tainer gardening, where environmental conditions have a magnified effect 
on plants.
Look to individual chapters for examples of succession planting options.

76
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Mixing Edibles and Ornamentals
Edibles traditionally are relegated to a separate, backyard garden. And this 
still makes sense if you use pesticides on your ornamental plants that aren’t 
appropriate for use on plants you’ll be eating. But as more and more garden-
ers move toward the least-toxic and organic pest controls, they’re also begin-
ning to mix and match ornamentals and edibles in the same garden. This is 
sometimes referred to as edible landscaping, and the concept is ideal for con-
tainer growing, too. Here are a few reasons to consider mixed plantings:
 
✓ Beauty: Adding a few flowering plants to a veggie planter makes it 
prettier.
 
✓ Pest-repellent properties: Some flowers, notably marigolds, are reputed 
to repel insect pests.
 
✓ Convenience: Add a few herb plants to the flower planter on your front 
stoop, and you can harvest a few sprigs just steps from the kitchen.
 
✓ Space conservation: If your garden space is limited to a deck or balcony, 
you can still grow lots of beautiful and tasty plants.
The Nature’s Bounty container design in Chapter 19 includes both flowers 
and edibles.
 
When you’re mixing plants in a container, be sure they’re compatible — they 
should have similar requirements for sunlight and soil moisture. And make 
sure the container is large enough to accommodate the plants’ mature sizes.

P
opular, fun, easy to grow, and universally loved, annual flowers are just 
the right plants to start with when talking about container gardening. 
They’re apt to be the first plants that you grow in containers, yet annual flow-
ers are so varied and abundant that even the most experienced gardeners 
never tire of growing them.
Nothing’s simpler than planting annuals in pots: Go to the nursery, put what-
ever looks good in the shopping cart, buy a pot and a bag of potting mix, take 
it all home, and put it together. That’s often plenty good enough. But that 
doesn’t have to be all there is to it. There are endless ways to combine plants 
and pots to create unique designs. You may be surprised at how much you 
enjoy the process and the results.
In this chapter, we point out the many reasons to grow annual flowers in con-
tainers, describe the special care needed that’s a bit different from growing 
the same plants in the ground, and then look at annuals that are particularly 
well-suited to container life.
Defining Annual Flowers
Annual flowers are one-season plants, typically sold in six-packs and small 
pots. Although many vegetables and herbs are annuals, the term annuals 
usually refers to purely decorative plants — those grown for their flowers 

78
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
or attractive foliage. If you ask for annuals at a nursery, they’ll direct you 
to annual flowers. Sometimes, they’re also called bedding plants because 
they’re traditionally used to add color to planting beds.
In addition to the familiar geraniums and petunias, plant breeders have intro-
duced a remarkable number of new annuals over the last few years, as well 
as new varieties of old favorites. Endless combinations of colors, sizes, and 
forms are possible!
Seeing What Makes Annuals So Popular
People grow annual flowers in containers for a variety of reasons, and not 
just because they don’t have a place to grow them in the ground. First and 
foremost, annuals are just plain fun to grow. They have some of the brightest, 
most appealing flowers, which attract children, butterflies, and just about 
anyone who wanders past. Here are some other reasons to give them a try:
 
✓ Annuals are movers. They grow fast and bloom when young, even while 
they’re still in the nursery packs, which is not always such a good thing 
(more on this later).
 
✓ Annuals give you the longest season of abundant bloom of any plants.
 
✓ Annuals are relatively inexpensive, especially if you buy small plants. If 
you make mistakes, you can pull out the plants, and you may even have 
enough time to replant.
 
✓ With containers, you can put your favorite annuals where they can be 
best appreciated: sweet peas on your deck where you can smell their 
fragrance; Johnny-jump-ups in an eye-level pot where you can view their 
tiny splotched faces.
 
✓ With containers, you can display plants at their peak. Then you can 
move them out of site for some R and R and replace them with others 
that are reaching their peak.
 
✓ You can rotate blooming containers of flowers by the season. Start with 
spring bloomers like pansies, follow with summer petunias, and then try 
fall asters.
 
✓ Nothing dresses up a deck or patio faster for a party than blooming 
annuals brimming from decorative pots.

 Chapter 7: Adding Pizzazz with Colorful Annual Flowers
Understanding Annuals’ 
Ideal Growing Seasons
In typical cold-winter climates, annuals are grown from spring to fall. In mild-
winter climates, annuals can thrive year-round. So when do you shop for 
annuals and plant them? That depends on your climate and the plants’ tem-
perature preferences.
 
The terms hardy, half-hardy, and tender describe different types of annuals. 
They don’t refer to the plants’ ability to withstand the coldest winter tempera-
tures; rather, they’re an indication of the plants’ temperature preferences 
during the growing season.
The term hardy annuals describes plants that can withstand some frost. 
They perform best when temperatures are mild, days are short, and soil is 
cool, typically in early spring and early fall. Their enemies are hot weather 
and long days, which cause a decline in performance and the onset of 
seed setting — ending the bloom season. Examples of hardy annuals are 
calendulas, pansies, and snapdragons. Plant these cool-season favorites a 
few weeks before the average last spring frost date in your area. (Refer to 
Chapter 2 for tips on determining your frost date.)
Freezing temperature damages or downright destroys tender annuals. Many of 
these tender types thrive in hot summer weather and are considered warm-
season annuals; examples are celosia, marigolds, vinca rosea, and zinnias. 
Plant them after the date of your last frost — and when soil and air tempera-
tures are warming up. Count on them to reach their peak in midsummer.
The term half-hardy describes plants that fall between hardy and tender. 
They can tolerate cool soils, chilly weather, and possibly a light frost, but 
will continue to grow through the summer in all but the hottest places. Many 
of the most common annual flowers fall into this category, including cosmos 
and petunias.
 
In regions with prolonged sub-freezing temperatures in winter, plant annuals 
in spring, enjoy them all summer into fall, and plan to replace them with fresh 
plants next spring. You can plant hardy and half-hardy annuals a few weeks 
before your last frost date, but wait until after that date to set out tender annu-
als. Garden centers usually sell the various types of annual flowers when the 
weather is right for planting them. If in doubt, ask the staff for advice.

In mild-winter regions where temperatures rarely or never drop below freez-
ing, you can plant cool-season annuals like pansies and Iceland poppies when 
temperatures begin to cool down in late summer or early fall. Blooms may 
appear before Christmas and peak in late winter and early spring. The plants 
will likely begin to fade as temperatures heat up in spring; replace them with 
warm-season plants.
Shopping for Annuals
When you’re ready to plant your container with annuals, you’ll probably 
decide to plant containers with nursery transplants (ranging in size from 
seedlings in six-packs to plants in 6-inch pots) rather than seeds. Transplants 
make it easier for you, and they’re not expensive when used in the quantities 
that most people buy for containers.
 
Look for plants that have a good green color and are relatively short and 
stocky. Start with small plants — their root systems adapt quickest to growing 
in new conditions. If you want color right away, buy larger, blooming plants in 
pots, gallon cans, or even larger containers. Just be sure that the roots haven’t 
filled the nursery container to the point of shedding water. At the nursery, 
don’t hesitate to tip the plant out of its pot or pack so that you can inspect the 
roots. Avoid plants with a thick tangle of roots.
Many small transplants sold these days already come with flowers — thanks 
to clever plant breeders successfully developing annuals to bloom preco-
ciously and tempt you into buying them rather than the more laggardly 
all-green seedlings. However, blooming as a youngster may actually impede 
future blooming. As painful as it may be, snipping off the flowers and flower 
buds will help the plant get established because it can focus on growing 
roots rather than energy-intensive flowers.
Some annuals are easy to start from seeds sown right in containers if you’re 
so inclined; good choices for seed sowing are cosmos, marigolds, nastur-
tiums, sunflowers, and zinnias.
Planting Annuals in Containers
What kind of containers are recommended for annuals? Almost anything goes, 
as long as it has drainage holes. There are so many kinds of annuals, so many 
colors, shapes, and sizes, and so many different kinds of looks that your con-
tainer choices are truly wide open. In the following sections, we give you the 
basic features to keep in mind when picking a container for annual flowers.

81
 Chapter 7: Adding Pizzazz with Colorful Annual Flowers
Pot size matters
Keep in mind that the smaller the pot, the faster the soil will dry out and the 
more often you’ll need to water. Following are some guidelines for container 
sizes:
To grow healthy annuals, the container needs to be at least 6 inches deep.
As a general rule of scale, if the annuals normally grow 10 or 12 inches tall, 
provide a pot with a diameter of at least 8 inches. If the plants grow 2 or 3 
feet tall, go for a diameter of 24 inches or a large container like a half barrel. 
See Chapter 3 for more information on containers.
Transplanting annuals to their new home
Starting with a good potting soil mix — not dirt dug up from your garden — 
goes a long way toward helping plants thrive. Look for soil mixes formulated 
for container growing. They have a good balance of water-holding capacity 
and drainage. (Look to Chapter 4 for details on choosing a soil mix.)
Set plants so that they’re at the same height in their new container as they 
were in their nursery pots. In other words, don’t bury plant stems, and don’t 
leave roots exposed above the soil line. (See Chapter 5 for step-by-step 
instructions on planting in containers.)
Flowers from above
The rewards of growing annual flowers in 
hanging baskets are pretty obvious — you get 
beautiful flowers or greenery at eye level or 
overhead where you can really appreciate the 
spectacular view. They’re ideal for dressing up 
places where you otherwise have no color. And 
remember that they can be viewed from indoors 
as well.
Before deciding on a location, make sure that 
you’ll have easy access for daily watering. 
(Even the reservoirs of self-watering baskets 
need frequent replenishing.) Keep in mind that 
most baskets drain water freely — right on your 
head if you happen to be sitting under one.
When it comes to size, you need to weigh two 
factors. Larger baskets hold more plants and 
generally require less frequent watering, but 
they’re heavy and require strong hooks or other 
hanging hardware. Smaller baskets limit the 
number and size of plants you can use and need 
to be watered frequently, but they’re easier 
to hang.

82
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Seasonal plants like annuals can be crowded together in a container more 
closely than is suggested for ground planting. Cramped conditions can return 
a much greater impact quickly. Annuals can’t grow in crowded conditions 
for long, but their season is short, and you can satisfy the demand for extra 
water and food that the tight quarters create (see the next section for tips on 
this). If the recommended spacing for ground planting is 10 to 12 inches, in a 
container you may space the plants 6 to 8 inches apart. In fact, as a general 
rule, you can safely plant most annuals 6 inches apart.
Care and feeding
An annual grown in a container needs the same things that a plant in the 
ground does — mainly water, air, and nutrients. Remember, though, that 
roots in a container are confined and can’t forage for what they need, so 
careful watering and feeding are essential.
 
More than anything else, remember that annuals like to set a fast pace with 
no pit stops: Running out of water or food can set them back for weeks or 
abruptly end their seasons.
Watering is much more critical for annuals grown in the confined spaces of 
containers than for those growing in the ground. Never let the soil dry out. 
You may want to install a drip system (discussed in Chapter 15) if you have 
many containers. Feeding container-grown annuals is also more critical than 
nourishing the same plants grown in the ground. Start feeding a few weeks 
after planting. Chapter 16 gives you the details.
Pinching and deadheading
Pinching and deadheading are important chores. Pinching is simply removing 
the growing tips on young plants, using your fingers or small pruners. This 
encourages the buds along the stem to sprout and grow. Plants that form 
shrubby mounds, such as chrysanthemums and petunias, benefit from this 
because it encourages lots of side branches.
Deadheading is removing spent flowers (see Figure 7-1). When you’re dead-
heading, don’t just pick off the petals; rather, pinch or snip off the whole 
spent flower head, which usually includes a developing seed pod. Doing this 
not only gets rid of unattractive fading blooms, it also removes the seeds 
that are developing within the flower head. The goal of flowering plants is to 
reproduce by making seeds. If you keep removing flower heads before the 
seeds mature, the plants will continue to produce flowers in an attempt to 
produce seeds. Keep deadheading, and they’ll keep producing flowers.

Top Annuals for Containers
When choosing plants for containers, pay special attention to their eventual 
sizes and growth habits. In general, compact varieties perform better in con-
tainers (sunflowers are perhaps the most extreme example, with the 10-foot 
Russian Giant out of the question and the 24-inch Teddy Bear perfect for con-
tainers). Look for dwarf varieties or those specially developed for containers. 
Names often provide a clue to container performance. Cascade petunias, for 
example, are designed to spill from pots.
Garden designers have coined three terms to help you choose plants for 
containers:
 
✓ Thrillers are tall, eye-catching plants for the center or back of the pot.
 
✓ Fillers are shrubby plants good for surrounding the taller center plant.
 
✓ Spillers tumble over the sides, softening the transition between plant 
and pot.

84
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
 
You can’t really go wrong if you plant a large container with a thriller in the 
center, surround it with a few fillers, and add some spillers around the edges. 
Flip to Part V for ideas and inspiration on mixing and matching annual flowers 
in containers, as well as specific “recipes.” And in the plant descriptions in the 
following sections, we indicate which category the annual fits in.
Figure 7-2 shows a planter filled with a combination of both upright and trail-
ing varieties of fuchsia plus shrubby impatiens, creating a lush planter that is 
suitable for a shady area of your yard. (The upright fuchsias are the thrillers; 
the impatiens, the fillers; the trailing fuchsia, the spillers.)

We group flowering annuals by hardiness and light requirements in the fol-
lowing sections. Use these lists to help you design your containers and create 
a planting calendar. If your region has a long spring and hot summer weather, 
you can plan on swapping out plants as the seasons change. Choose all cool-
season plants for a spring planting, and replace them with tender heat-lovers 
when summer hits. Then go back to cool-season plants in fall. Or you may 
decide to do a single planting, choosing all half-hardy plants and enjoying 
them spring to fall. Or, you can wait until after your last frost date and plant 
only heat-lovers, or a combination of half-hardy plants and heat-lovers. Lots 
of options! We also include sections on vines and foliage plants and ornamen-
tal grasses.

Hardy, cool-season plants for sunny spots
These plants like cool weather and can tolerate light frosts, but they begin 
to flag as summer heats up. They’re perfect for spring and fall planters, and 
grow right through the winter in mild climates. Plan to replace them with 
heat-lovers in summer.
 
✓ Calendula: Here’s a great choice for containers early in the year. 
Sturdy plants and bright orange or yellow blooms stand up well to cool 
weather. Thriller or filler, depending on variety/height.
 
✓ Iceland poppy: A cool-season stalwart, its crinkly flowers in bright 
oranges, pinks, yellows, and other shades stand tall on long slender 
stems, but the plants are low and unprepossessing — best mixed with 
spreading plants that can provide some camouflage. Pansies are good 
container companions. Thriller.
 
✓ Lobelia: Call on the compact edging types to tuck into mixed plantings. 
Use the trailing types to spill from hanging baskets or pots. Flowers in 
light to deep blue, as well as white and lavender, lend themselves to color-
combining with many other annuals. Filler or spiller, depending on variety.
 
✓ Ornamental kale: Grow it for striking, multicolored foliage — not 
flowers — early in the season and in fall, when colorful flowers are 
hard to come by. Show off a single plant in an 8-inch pot, or put 
several in a larger container. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Pansy and viola: Hardy and carefree, these are often the first annuals 
you notice in containers each spring. Pansies have big, blotchy flow-
ers. Violas are usually solid colors — yellow, blue, purple, and more. 
Combine pansies or violas with bulbs or fill pots with single or mixed 
colors. Filler.
 
✓ Salvia: There are many types of salvia, so read plant labels. Salvia farina-
cea sports 2-foot spikes of deep blue flowers, adding height and cooling 
color to containers. Thriller.
 
✓ Snapdragon: Height varies, so read plant labels. Tall varieties add 
drama to large containers; dwarf types are shrubbier. Cut a few spikes 
for indoor bouquets, too. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Sweet pea: The familiar tall, climbing sweet pea quickly grows out of 
bounds in a container. Bush types make a fairly restrained container 
plant, growing only 12 to 30 inches tall. Flowers have a heavenly fra-
grance. Filler.

86
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Half-hardy plants for sunny spots
These plants like the cool weather of spring and fall, and some may tolerate 
a light frost. However, they also continue to grow through the summer in 
all but the hottest regions, making them some of the best choices for single-
season containers.
 
✓ Bacopa: Clouds of tiny white, blue, or pink flowers cover these trailing 
plants. They can be temperamental and will drop their flowers and buds 
if the soil dries out. Give them part shade in hot, sunny weather. Spiller.
 
✓ Bidens: Heat- and drought-tolerant, these plants are covered with small 
yellow flowers all season long. Spiller.
 
✓ Calibrachoa: A relatively new petunia relative, this plant is sometimes 
called million bells for its profusion of small, richly colored, petunia-like 
flowers. Tolerant and adaptable, this is one forgiving plant. If it starts to 
look ragged, cut it back and it will rebound quickly. Spiller.
 
✓ Cleome: With a height of 2 to 4 feet, depending on variety, cleome 
belongs in the center of the container where it can attract attention with 
its airy pink, purple, or white blooms. Thriller.
 
✓ Diascia: Also called twinspur, this plant’s soft spikes of brightly colored 
flowers are ideal for informal containers, where they’ll tumble every 
which way for a rambling, cottage-garden look. Filler.
 
✓ Gaura: With slender flower stems topped by delicate blooms, gaura 
adds a delicate note to plantings. Height varies, from 10 inches to 3 feet 
or more, so check plant labels. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Geraniums: We can’t think of any geranium that isn’t a candidate for 
good, healthy living in a container. Put a few zonal geraniums in terra-
cotta pots on your front stoop. Ivy geraniums are a favorite choice for 
hanging baskets. Scented geraniums have less-showy flowers but very 
fragrant foliage. (Note that these “annual geraniums” are in the genus 
Pelargonium and are different from hardy, perennial “true geraniums” in 
the genus Geranium.) Filler.
 
✓ Lantana: This adaptable, shrubby plant bears showy flower clusters 
from spring to fall. On many varieties the flower color changes with age, 
so the older, outer flowers of each cluster are a different color than the 
younger, inner ones. Filler.
 
✓ Nemesia: These plants like cool temperatures; move them to part shade 
when summer heats up. Flowers are richly and vividly colored in red, 
yellow, white, pink, and blue. Plants grow 8 to 18 inches tall — great 
near the rims of containers where they can spill over the sides. Filler or 
spiller.
 
✓ Petunias: On their own or in mixed plantings, petunias are standouts for 
containers with their abundant, crayon-colored flowers. They vary in 

87
 Chapter 7: Adding Pizzazz with Colorful Annual Flowers
height, shape, and habit depending on the variety, so check plant labels. 
If plants get too rangy in containers, cut stems back by about a third. 
Filler or spiller.
 
✓ Scaevola: Called fan flower for its unusual, fan-shaped blooms, scaevola 
can be kept shrubby with regular pruning or be allowed to sprawl and 
drape in hanging baskets. Give it part shade in hot, sunny weather. Filler 
or spiller.
 
✓ Sweet alyssum: Low and spreading with a profusion of tiny flowers, this 
is a dependable choice for filling in among mixed annuals or spilling over 
edges of a pot. Sweet alyssum is easy to grow from seeds or transplants. 
Familiar white is a great complement in mixed plantings, but rose and 
purple varieties are also available. Filler or spiller.
Tender plants for sunny spots
These plants love the heat. Wait until after the last spring frost to plant 
these flowers, and be prepared to cover them if temperatures drop below 50 
degrees Fahrenheit. They’re good candidates for replacing cool-season plants 
when they begin to wane as summer heats up.
 
✓ African daisy (Arctotis and Osteospermum spp.): These shrubby 
plants with colorful, daisylike flowers bloom profusely from spring to 
fall. Filler.
 
✓ Ageratum: These puffy little flowers most typically are blue, but white 
and pink also are available. Tall varieties reach 2 feet, but the most 
common varieties are dwarf, growing just 8 to 10 inches tall. Filler.
 
✓ Angelonia (sometimes called summer snapdragon): The tall flower 
spikes are a good warm-season replacement for cool-season snapdrag-
ons. They tolerate heat and drought. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Celosia: Dramatic, fluffy plumes in the brightest yellow, orange, red, and 
pink adorn these plants all summer. Height ranges from 8 inches to 2 
feet, depending on variety. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Cosmos: Lacy and elegant, tall cosmos (up to 4 feet) stand out in bor-
ders and can also perform in large containers (half barrels, for example). 
For smaller containers, look for more compact or dwarf varieties. The 
daisylike flowers come in a range of magentas, pinks, yellows, oranges, 
and whites. Thriller or filler.
 
✓ Dahlia: You want compact bedding dahlias, not the tall, pot-toppling 
varieties (unless you grow them in a huge container). Dwarf dahlias 
grow about 12 to 15 inches tall, with flowers in bright, clear colors: 
orange, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow. Thriller or filler.

88
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
 
✓ Euphorbia: A recent introduction named Diamond Frost has become 
popular for its tiny white blooms atop wiry stems. A good filler, this 
plant is heat- and drought-tolerant. Filler.
 
✓ Gerbera: Look for this elegant, deeply colored daisy sold blooming in 
pots. Transplant a few into a larger container, and enjoy the striking 
flowers. They can be fussy, however, so don’t take it personally if the 
plants are short-lived. Filler.
 
✓ Marigold: Compact French marigolds and signet marigolds (12 to 20 
inches tall) are indispensable container classics. Fill a pot with a single 
variety or combine marigolds with other annuals. Colors include yellow 
and orange, plus mixes of orange, yellow, maroon, dark red, and more. 
These aromatic plants may help deter insect pests. Filler.
 
✓ Pentas: These mounding plants are topped with flower clusters that are 
absolute magnets for butterflies. They flower best in full sun but will tol-
erate and continue to flower in part shade. Filler.
 
✓ Portulaca: Also called moss rose, this low-growing plant has succulent 
leaves and abundant flowers in brilliant colors. This heat-lover needs 
very well-drained soil and is a good choice for sunny window boxes. 
Spiller.
 
✓ Salvia (S. splendens): Usually called annual salvia to distinguish it from 
its perennial cousins, this mounding plant is topped by bright spikes 
of red, white, or purple flowers and is an attention-getter in containers. 
Filler.
 
✓ Strawflower: The petals (technically, bracts) of these daisylike flowers 
are dry and papery, making them popular for drying. Look for dwarf vari-
eties that grow 12 to 15 inches tall. Filler.
 
✓ Sunflowers: Bushy dwarf varieties grow only 1 or 2 feet tall and are ter-
rific in containers. Two top choices are Dwarf Sungold and Teddy Bear. 
Sunflowers are easy to grow from seeds started directly in containers. 
Thriller.
 
✓ Verbena: With clusters of red, purple, yellow, pink, or white flowers, 
verbenas can take the heat and are reliable performers. Some varieties 
are more upright; others are trailing. Filler or spiller.
 
✓ Vinca rosea: Take a lesson from shopping centers and other public 
spaces where you see vinca rosea in the hottest spots. This is one 
tough, heat-loving annual for containers that must face hot sun. Its foli-
age always looks sharp and glossy. White and pink flowers bloom over a 
very long season. Filler.
 
✓ Zinnias: Mix the colors or use single colors for bright containers in full 
sun. Compact dwarfs, notably the Profusion series, work best in contain-
ers. Zinnias come in hot colors and do well in hot weather. Filler.

89
 Chapter 7: Adding Pizzazz with Colorful Annual Flowers
Annuals for shady locations
Color is harder to come by in shady spots, but a handful of annuals thrive in 
containers and will bloom well in light to medium shade.
 
✓ Bedding begonia: Tuberous, rex, angelwing, and rieger begonias offer 
some of the most dramatic flowers around, not to mention the unusual 
and often variegated foliage. The plants are somewhat fragile, so place 
them where they won’t be buffeted by wind or inadvertently damaged 
by passersby. Some varieties are more upright; others trailing. Wax 
begonias are smaller and more tolerant of sun. Filler or spiller.
 
✓ Browallia: This is a beautiful trailing plant with white or blue flowers. A 
number of new varieties are available specifically for hanging baskets. 
Spiller.
 
✓ Fuchsia: Impossibly bright, bell-shaped flowers attract hummingbirds, 
making cascading varieties ideal for eye-level hanging baskets. Some 
varieties are shrubbier and more upright. Thriller, filler, or spiller.
 
✓ Impatiens: Impatiens perform brilliantly in containers, including hang-
ing baskets. Flower colors include red, pink, rose, violet, orange, white, 
and bicolors. Double-flowered varieties are especially nice in containers 
where you can admire the blooms up close. New Guinea impatiens have 
larger, glossier leaves and tolerate more sun. Filler.
 
✓ Torenia: Also called wishbone flower, torenia tolerates heat and humid-
ity and flowers all summer long in part to full shade. Read plant labels — 
some torenias are shrubby; others trail. Filler or spiller.
Flowering vines
Grow these vines on a trellis or other vertical support for a traffic-stopping dis-
play. Place them in front of a fence or lattice to hide an eyesore or add a little 
privacy to your outdoor living areas. If you have a large container, you can set 
a trellis right in it. Or set the container in front of a wall-mounted support.
 
✓ Black-eyed Susan vine: Also called thunbergia, this vine bears striking 
orange or white flowers with black centers and grows up to 8 feet tall, a 
manageable height for container growing. Plant in full sun.
 
✓ Mandevilla: This pretty, tropical vine sports large, trumpet-shaped 
blossoms on glossy leaves. Plant it in full sun. At the end of the growing 
season, trim it back and bring it indoors over the winter. Set it outside 
again the following spring.
 
✓ Morning glory, cypress vine, and cardinal climber: All plants in the 
genus Ipomoea, these are rambling vines that can reach 15 feet or more 
in height and need strong supports. All need full sun.

90
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Foliage plants and ornamental grasses
Grown for their attractive leaves rather than their flowers, foliage plants can 
provide unusual forms and textures on their own or be used to complement 
flowers.
 
✓ Alternanthera: The common names Joseph’s coat and calico plant refer 
to the colorful foliage, which may be any combination of green, yellow, 
orange, red, or purple, depending on the variety. Plant in part to full 
shade.
 
✓ Coleus: Colorful foliage brightens shady spots and adds a tropical look. 
Recent introductions boast an astounding range of foliage colors, from 
chartreuse to purple-black, with variegated varieties combining colors 
to rival the boldest flowers. Most coleus prefer part to full shade; some 
of the newer varieties tolerate full sun.
 
✓ Dracaena: These tall, strappy-leaved plants are commonly used in the 
center of large containers to add height. Most varieties prefer part 
shade.
 
✓ Dusty miller: Traditionally used as a filler and accent for bright flow-
ers, this plant’s silvery gray foliage beautifully sets off purple petunias, 
red impatiens, or many other annuals and colors. Plants grow 12 to 15 
inches tall. Plant in full sun.
 
✓ Fountain grass: The strappy leaves and tall flower stalks topped with 
feathery plumes add a gentle, graceful movement as they sway in the 
slightest breeze. Plant in full sun to part shade.
 
✓ Helichrysum: Called licorice plant for the aroma released by its leaves, 
this trailing plant has velvety leaves in a range of hues from chartreuse 
to gray-green. Plant in full sun to part shade.
 
✓ Plectranthus: Also called Swedish ivy, this plant has fuzzy leaves and 
can be kept to a mounding habit or allowed to trail over the sides of the 
container. Plant in full sun to part shade.
 
✓ Sweet potato vine: With richly colored foliage in hues of bright yellow-
green to bronze to burgundy, these plants start out shrubby but will 
eventually trail gracefully over the sides of containers. Plant in full sun 
to part shade.
 
✓ Vinca vine: Not to be confused with flowering Vinca rosea, the green or 
green-and-white foliage trails down the sides of pots. Plant in full sun.

magine deep red, vine-ripened tomatoes, aromatic basil, cooling cucum-
bers, and lettuce so fresh it’s practically still growing — all harvested 
from your patio. Achieving this vision isn’t as daunting a task as you may 
expect. Growing vegetables in containers — on a patio, deck, balcony, or 
even out in the garden — is not that difficult. And the tasty payoff makes it 
especially rewarding.
With some planning, you can eat your own produce all summer long. 
Apartment dwellers and homeowners alike find container vegetables appeal-
ing. First, the convenience is tough to match: Just walk out on the deck and 
snip some lettuce for a salad or swipe a few peas for a stir-fry. And second, 
the flexibility yields some fresh ideas: Plant cherry tomatoes in hanging 
baskets or lettuce among your petunias. Move containers as necessary to 
give them the sunniest spot on the deck or to get them out of the way when 
company arrives and you need the space. With vegetables in containers, you 
truly have a movable feast.
And don’t overlook culinary herbs for containers. Many are attractive and 
fit right in with ornamental plants. Usually less demanding than vegetables, 
many herbs are of Mediterranean origin and like it on the hot and dry side. 
Brush by a pot of thyme, rosemary, or sage on the way to the door, and you 
may imagine you’re in the south of France.
In this chapter you find general information on growing vegetables and herbs 
in containers, as well as crop-by-crop tips. Bon appétit!

Giving Container Vegetables and 
Herbs What They Really Need
If you grow vegetables in the ground, you know that the number-one rule is 
to keep them growing vigorously — with plenty of water, nutrients, sunlight, 
and whatever else the specific crops require. Vegetables and herbs in con-
tainers need no less care. In fact, providing the essentials to vegetables and 
herbs growing in containers can be more challenging because their growing 
space is limited.
 
To ease the caretaking task, place container plants in a convenient spot where 
you can dote on them. Your portable garden is likely to reward your attention 
with tasty returns! Following is some general information; look to the sections 
on individual crops for specifics.
Plenty of sunlight
Sunshine is a common limiting factor in vegetable and herb gardening, 
especially for apartment dwellers and gardeners with small yards. Most 
edibles need a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight, at least some of it 
during midday when the sun’s rays are strongest. The sunniest spot in your 
yard may be your front stoop or the corner of your back deck. Wherever it 
is, dedicate it to your veggies and herbs.
Exceptions to the full-sun rule include lettuce and spinach, which actually ben-
efit from some shade in the heat of midsummer to keep them from bolting — 
sending up flower heads that end your salad-picking days. Root vegetables like 
carrots and beets can tolerate some light shade, too. So even if you don’t have 
a spot in full sun, you can grow something for the dinner table!
The right container
First question: Can vegetables and herbs be beautiful as well as productive? 
Of course, if you choose attractive pots and keep your plants well tended.
If all you want is to pick the produce and you don’t care what the container 
looks like, the requirements are pretty basic:

93
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
 
✓ The container must be big enough. As a rule of thumb, containers 
should be at least 8 inches wide and 12 inches deep for most vegetables 
and herbs, but a diameter of 12 to 18 inches and a depth of 15 inches is 
preferable — the larger size can accommodate the necessary volume of 
soil and water.
 
✓ The container must have drainage holes at the bottom. Plastic mop 
buckets, small garbage cans, 5-gallon buckets from delicatessens, and 
even plastic milk jugs are all possibilities if you poke some holes for 
drainage, even if they miss the boat in the beauty department.
If the containers are going to be part of your garden scene, you probably 
want something more presentable (but with the recommended dimensions 
and drainage holes). Remember that terra cotta, no matter how attractive, 
tends to dry out quickly — a major problem for vegetables and herbs racing 
full steam ahead. You may be better off planting in plastic. If you want a big 
container to hold a number of vegetables and herbs or a whole salad’s fix-
ings, an oak half-barrel is hard to beat. (See Chapter 3 for more details about 
containers.)
A good soil mix
Commercial soil mixes, as we describe in Chapter 4, can be used straight 
from the bag. But many vegetables and herbs benefit from additional organic 
matter like bagged compost or ground bark: Add one part of organic matter 
to each three parts of soil mix.
The benefits of growing your own veggies
There’s renewed interest in home-grown foods 
as more and more people discover the rewards 
of food gardening. Here are a few:
 ✓ Getting the freshest vegetables: Hands 
down, the freshest, best-tasting vegetables 
and herbs are those you grow yourself and 
harvest at their peak.
 ✓ Saving money: Growing your own food 
saves money, especially when it comes 
to “gourmet” vegetables like fancy lettuce 
mixes and Oriental eggplant.
 ✓ Using fewer pesticides: You know exactly 
what’s been sprayed, and you may opt 
for organic fertilizing and pest control 
techniques.
 ✓ Becoming a locavore: Eating locally pro-
duced, in-season foods is a growing trend, 
and nothing is more local than your own 
backyard!
 ✓ Trying new vegetables: Want to try the 
latest variety of squash or lettuce, but can’t 
get it at your local grocery store? That’s not 
a problem if you have the right conditions 
for growing it in your yard.

Water, water, water
Watering is always important with container plants, and even more so with 
vegetables and herbs — let them wilt once and they may never really get 
back on track. Containers can dry out in a day or in a few hours depending on 
the planter’s size and the intensity of the summer heat, and even if you rewet 
it right away, the plants may be permanently stunted.
 
To avoid letting your plants get too thirsty, check pots and planters often and 
don’t allow the soil to dry out more than an inch or two below the surface. 
Self-watering planters and drip irrigation can help ease your watering chores: 
Chapter 15 delves into these and other watering options.
Fertilizer
In general, vegetables and herbs are heavy feeders — especially when grown 
in containers. The need for nutrients varies according to what you’re grow-
ing. Lettuce and other leafy crops need a consistent supply of nitrogen to 
produce those leaves, whereas tomatoes need some nitrogen to grow, but 
too much can inhibit flowering — no flowers, no tomatoes.
 
One option is to mix an all-purpose, slow-release, granular fertilizer — 
organic or synthetic — into the soil mix before planting. Or, plan to fertilize 
religiously during the growing season. Find out more about fertilizer options 
in Chapter 16.
Choosing Vegetables for Containers
Theoretically, you can grow just about any vegetable in a container. 
Questions do come up, though, about the appropriate pot for those 600-
pound pumpkins — maybe the right container is the back of the pickup that 
hauls the monster to the county contest weigh-in. We suggest that you grow 
crops that can provide you with at least a few fresh meals and that don’t 
monopolize your whole patio or life. Although some vegetables are techni-
cally perennials, the most common crops are typically grown as annuals and 
produce their edible harvest the first season.
Try to choose container-friendly varieties: vegetables that are naturally 
small-statured and bred specifically for growing in pots. When you read seed 
catalogs, look for varieties described with words like “compact,” “good for 
containers,” “bush-type,” “baby vegetable,” “midget,” “dwarf,” and “tiny.” 
Think twice before choosing varieties with words like “jumbo,” “gargantua,” 
“mammoth,” and “whopper” in their names.

95
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
 
Like annual flowers, vegetables and herbs have temperature preferences. 
Some grow best in the cool of spring and fall (or winter in mild climates). 
Others need heat to thrive. For the biggest and tastiest harvest, time your 
planting to coincide with the best weather for individual crops. To help you 
know what to plant when, we group veggies by their growing season in the 
following sections.
Cool-season vegetables
In cold-winter regions, sow seeds or set out transplants in early spring, a 
few weeks before your average last-frost date (see Chapter 2) so the plants 
mature while the weather is cool. In mild-winter climates, plant in fall for a 
winter harvest.
Broccoli, cabbage, and kinfolk
Collectively called brassicas or cole crops, plants in this group are in the 
Cruciferae or mustard family and include the familiar broccoli, Brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, and mustard. Less common kin include 
broccoflower (a cross between broccoli and cauliflower), Chinese cabbage, 
kohlrabi, and romanesco broccoli. All need similar care and cool weather.
We recommend these varieties:
 
✓ Broccoli: Arcadia, DeCicco, Marathon, Munchkin, Small Miracle
 
✓ Cabbage: Danish Ballhead, Melissa Savoy
 
✓ Cauliflower: Cheddar, Snowball
Lettuce and spinach
Leafy greens grow quickly: You can begin harvesting your own gourmet baby 
spinach and lettuce in just four weeks. Plant seeds every few weeks in spring 
for a constant supply into early summer. (Most salad greens turn bitter and 
bolt, producing flowers and seed, once the weather heats up.) Start planting 
again in late summer for a fall harvest. In warm-winter areas, you can grow 
salad greens all winter.
Spinach and loose-leaf lettuces are the easiest to grow. For an extended har-
vest and to keep plants attractive, cut individual leaves as you need them, 
rather than cutting the whole plant off at the base. (The plants resprout, but 
they look unattractive for a few weeks.) Buttercrunch varieties (also called 
butterhead and Boston lettuce) make small, loose heads. They’re also easy to 
grow and are more tolerant of hot weather than loose-leaf lettuces. Sow seeds 
for some unusual greens, too, like arugula (rocket), mache, radicchio, and 
watercress. Or sow a mesclun mix (a combination of various greens, often 
including some spicy ones) for harvesting when they’re just a few inches tall.

96
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
The following varieties of lettuce and spinach are good ones to try:
 
✓ Lettuce: Buttercrunch, Tom Thumb, Salad Bowl, Romaine, Dark Green 
Boston, Ruby, Bibb
 
✓ Spinach: Bloomsdale, Matador
Onions and their relatives
Onions, scallions, chives, and leeks are collectively called alliums, and they’re 
kitchen essentials. Plant scallions every few weeks from early spring to fall 
for a constant supply. Sow leek seed in early spring. Leeks are slow growers, 
but worth waiting for when you can impress your friends with homegrown, 
gourmet, grilled leeks. Chives are perennials that are hardy to zone 3. Snip off 
leaves as you need them.
 
Chive blossoms are edible, and their lavender color gives a nice tint to herb 
vinegars.
We suggest the following varieties of scallions and leeks:
 
✓ Leeks: Imperial Summer, Tornado
 
✓ Scallions: Beltsville Bunching, Long White Bunching
Peas
Cool temperatures produce the sweetest, most tender peas. Plant seeds of 
edible-podded pea varieties, including snow peas and sugar snap peas, and 
shelling types (which you remove from the pod before eating) in early spring 
for an early summer harvest. Plant them again in late summer for a fall har-
vest. (In mild-winter regions they make a good winter crop.) Some varieties 
are climbers and need support; others are lower-growing bush types.
We recommend the following varieties:
 
✓ Shelling peas: Garden Sweet, Half Pint
 
✓ Snap peas: Super Sugar Snap
 
✓ Snow peas: Oregon Sugar Pod II, Tom Thumb
Root crops
Beets, radishes, and turnips are good candidates for containers at least 8 
inches deep. Short, stubby carrot varieties like Thumbelina are also fine. For 
full-size carrots and parsnips, choose containers that are at least 12 inches 
deep. Sow seeds in early spring, in soil that is lightweight and drains freely. 
Harvest them while they’re young and tender (with the exception of parsnips, 
which taste best when they’ve been exposed to a few fall frosts).

97
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
Potatoes are large plants, each requiring a 5-gallon pot or larger. Plant seed 
potatoes — small potatoes sold specially for planting — in early spring for a 
summer harvest.
Try planting any of the following varieties of root vegetables in your containers:
 
✓ Beets: Baby Ball, Chicago Red, Detroit Dark Red
 
✓ Carrots: Little Finger, Red-Cored Chantenay, Thumbelina, Short ’n’ Sweet
 
✓ Parsnips: Hamburg, Harris Model
 
✓ Potatoes: Red Gold, French Fingerling, All Blue
 
✓ Radishes: Cherry Belle, Easter Egg, French Breakfast
 
✓ Turnips: Purple Top, Tokyo Cross
Warm-season vegetables
These crops need warm soil to sprout and warm air temperatures to grow. 
Wait until after the last frost date to plant them. Some fast-growing, warm-
season crops are best started directly from seed; others require a longer 
growing season, so you’re better off setting them in as transplants that 
you’ve grown indoors or purchased.
Beans
Beans are easy to grow and provide a nutritious, protein-rich harvest. Bush 
varieties stay compact, have high yields, and mature over a period of a few 
weeks, usually earlier than pole beans. Pole varieties can do fine in pots, as 
long as you provide stakes or taut strings for them to run up. The effect can 
be attractive, especially for a balcony. Look for yellow- and purple-podded 
varieties in addition to the usual green.
 
Plant bean seeds in spring when temperatures are reliably warm. (Bean seed 
will rot in the ground if planted in cool, wet soil.) After seeds sprout, thin seed-
lings by removing any extras so that the remaining ones stand 6 inches apart. 
Water and fertilize regularly, and harvest beans continually, or they’ll stop 
producing.
We suggest the following varieties:
 
✓ Bush: Masai, Topcrop, Greencrop, Purple Queen, Gold Mine
 
✓ Pole: Kentucky Blue, Romano, Blue Lake, Purple King

98

Corn
Surely not! But yes, you can grow corn in containers. It’s one of those crops 
that take a lot of room and extra care, so think twice about whether it might 
be easier to buy corn from a local farm and save your containers for some-
thing more manageable.
If you’re determined to give it a try, provide soil mix with lots of organic 
matter and a deep, large container like a half-barrel. Sow seeds in spring 
when the weather — and the soil — warms up. (Like bean seed, corn seed 
sown in cold, wet soil will rot.) Plan on watering and fertilizing abundantly.
Varieties with a shorter stature are more likely to produce mature ears and 
less likely to topple in the wind than taller ones. Because the plants are wind-
pollinated, the ears may not fill out completely as they would if you planted 
a large block in your garden. But if you have your heart set on homegrown 
sweet corn, by all means plant a big container or two.
Choose from these recommended varieties:
 
✓ Sweet corn: Golden Midget, Sugar Buns, Precocious
 
✓ Popping corn: Tom Thumb
Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash
There are bush and vining varieties of these closely related crops, collec-
tively referred to as cucurbits. For containers, look for varieties described 
as compact. Full-sized plants, especially winter squash and pumpkins, grow 
quickly and will overtake your containers . . . your deck . . . maybe even your 
house. If you choose vining types, provide space and a trellis for climbing. All 
cucurbits need warm soil to germinate and hot weather to produce a good 
crop. Sow seeds in spring after the weather warms up, or plant transplants to 
get a head start.
Plant a “three sisters garden” in a pot
Native Americans planted three warm-season 
crops together: corn, beans, and squash. Called 
the three sisters, these plants help each other 
grow: The beans add nitrogen to the soil, corn 
(which needs lots of nitrogen) gives the beans 
something to climb, and the broad leaves of the 
squash plants keep weeds at bay.
Make your own “three sisters garden” by plant-
ing a dozen corn seeds in the middle of a large 
planter — at least a half barrel. When the corn 
is a few inches tall, plant eight bean seeds in a 
circle around it. After another week or so, plant 
four squash seeds around the perimeter. Keep 
the soil moist and fertilize regularly, and you’ll 
be harvesting your own three sisters. Flip to the 
color section in the middle of this book for a pic-
ture of a “three sisters garden.”

99
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
Here are some good varieties to get you started on the right track:
 
✓ Cucumbers: Bush Pickle, Salad Bush, Patio Pick, Spacemaster
 
✓ Melons: Honey Bun cantaloupe, Sugar Baby watermelon
 
✓ Pumpkins: Summer Ball
 
✓ Squash: Greyzini and Space Miser zucchini, Sunburst and Scallopini 
Pattypan, Table Queen Acorn
Eggplant and peppers
Warm, rich soil mix and hot sun are the ingredients for successful eggplants 
and peppers. They’re particularly well-suited to container growing. The 
plants are compact, and they’re beautiful when laden with colorful fruit. They 
require a long growing season, so start seeds indoors in spring or purchase 
transplants. Set plants out when the weather turns warm for the season.
 
Hot peppers are sometimes rated using Scoville heat units (SHUs) based on 
the amount of capsaicin they contain, because capsaicin gives peppers their 
heat. Sweet peppers contain none, so their rating is 0. Jalapeños run hotter, 
with a rating of around 4,000. Habaneros, on the high end of the scale, come in 
at a fiery 200,000 or more. Many of the pepper varieties sold as ornamental 
plants are of the hottest variety. Use care when handling these and other hot 
peppers because capsaicin can cause a painful burning sensation.
We recommend the following varieties:
 
✓ Eggplant: Fairy Tale, Bambino, Morden Midget, Long Tom
 
✓ Hot peppers: Apache, Birdseye, Cubanelle, Cheyenne
 
✓ Sweet peppers: Red Popper, Golden Baby Belle, Mohawk, Jingle Bells
Okra
A mainstay in Southern cooking, okra is a member of the hibiscus family and 
has beautiful blossoms in ivory, yellow, or red. It likes sun and heat and is 
an ideal crop for containers, because the soil in the pot heats up in the sun. 
Sow seeds when the weather has warmed up, or start with transplants for an 
earlier harvest.
We recommend Baby Bubba Hybrid and Little Lucy.
Summer greens
Most greens, like lettuce and spinach, grow best in cool weather, but a few 
types thrive in the heat and will provide a nutritious harvest all summer long. 
Swiss chard, Malabar spinach, New Zealand spinach, and vegetable amaranth 
love hot weather and are easy to grow. They’re attractive plants, too, so mix 
them in with heat-loving annual flowers.

100
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
Try the Bright Lights or Rhubarb variety of Swiss chard.
Tomatoes
Close relatives of eggplants and peppers, tomatoes are so popular in home 
gardens they deserve a category of their own. A sun-warmed, vine-ripened 
tomato defines summer for many gardeners. Although full-sized plants can 
grow in 5-gallon or larger containers, new compact varieties make it easy to 
grow tomatoes anywhere you have a spot of sunshine.
Tomato plants are classified as either determinate (those that grow to a point 
and stop) or indeterminate (those that keep on growing . . . and growing). 
Both types need some sort of support — you can use tomato cages or tie 
plant stems to trellises or stakes — but determinate tomatoes are more man-
ageable for containers.
Tomatoes need a deep container. Plant nursery seedlings in spring after 
the weather has warmed up. Unlike most plants, you can bury the stems of 
tomato seedlings — they’ll develop roots along the buried portion. At plant-
ing time, prune off the lowest set of leaves and set the plant deeply in the 
container so the next set of leaves is just above the soil line. This technique 
encourages the plant to develop an extensive root system that will help it 
take up the abundant water and nutrients it needs.
 
Upside-down planters are usually advertised as ideal for growing tomatoes, 
and they do offer some benefits, the most important being that because the 
plants aren’t in contact with garden soil, they’re less susceptible to soil-borne 
diseases. You can achieve a similar effect by planting tomatoes in sterile soil 
mix in any hanging basket or pot raised off the ground.
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of tomato varieties, so experiment to 
see what varieties you like best and grow well in your climate. (Some farmer’s 
markets offer tomato taste testings — they’re a good way to try new varieties 
before growing them in your garden.) The following varieties are particu-
larly good for growing in containers: Patio Princess, Celebrity, BushSteak, 
Tumbler, Windowbox Roma, Sugary, and Super Bush.
Trying your hand at something different
Growing your own crops means you can try vegetables and herbs not avail-
able in your supermarket. You can try out different varieties of your old 
favorites, like Asian eggplants and Armenian cucumbers. And you can experi-
ment with crops you’ve never tasted, or even seen — perhaps tatsoi (a leafy 
member of the cabbage family) or jicama (a crispy, sweet root vegetable).

101
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
Other vegetables you may want to experiment with include
 
✓ Broccoli raab: A more pungent type of broccoli, sometimes called 
rapini.
 
✓ Edamame: Soybeans that are eaten green rather than dried.
 
✓ Florence fennel: The lower leaves form a bulb with a refreshing anise 
flavor.
The best way to find out about new and unusual crops is to browse seed 
catalogs, especially those that specialize in heirloom varieties and those 
that include crops associated with different cuisines — Asian and Indian, for 
example. Nichols Garden Nursery (www.nicholsgardennursery.com) is 
one good source of information — and seeds.
Selecting Herbs for Containers
Herbs make perfect sense for containers. Most herbs are easy to grow, and 
they look good, too. Many form compact, attractive plants that look at home 
in their own pots or tucked among flowers.
 
Place your herb pots where they’re handy from the kitchen or patio. Who’s in 
favor of jogging out past the pump house to the back 40 when you desperately 
need rosemary for the chicken you’re barbecuing on your back patio?
Like vegetables, herbs vary in their temperature preferences — some like it 
cool; others need the heat. Their flavor and aroma is due to the essential oils 
they contain: Many herbs have the best flavor when they’re watered and fer-
tilized sparingly, which increases the concentration of these oils. The follow-
ing sections group herbs by the weather conditions they prefer.
Herbs that like it hot and dry
Many of the most popular herbs are native to Mediterranean climates where 
they thrive in hot sun with little rainfall. In regions with lots of summer rain, 
containers may be your only option for growing them, because you can move 
them under cover to keep them from getting too much water. Plant them 
in very well-drained soil and fertilize sparingly. These herbs are good can-
didates for combining in a planter, because they like the same conditions. 
Herbs in this category include

102
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
 
✓ Marjoram and oregano: Aromatic, sweet marjoram is an annual that’s 
easy to grow from seed and tolerates light frost. Oregano is similar, but 
is a perennial and has a more pungent aroma and taste.
 
✓ Rosemary: A shrub in its native habitat, rosemary requires a large 
container with a well-drained soil mix and hot sun. Rosemary is not reli-
ably hardy below zone 8, but small plants may overwinter indoors with 
bright sunlight.
 
✓ Sage: More cold-hardy than rosemary, sage can survive outside to zone 4. 
Sage is available in many varieties: tricolor, purple, golden, and dwarf — a 
good bet for a container.
 
✓ Savory: With a strong peppery aroma, winter savory is a wonderful addi-
tion to a pot of beans. It’s hardy to zone 6. Summer savory is an annual 
with a more delicate aroma.
 
✓ Tarragon: An ungainly plant, tarragon belongs in a pot with more 
orderly herbs (such as sage). Look for French tarragon, which can only 
be propagated from cuttings. If you see tarragon seeds, they’re the less 
desirable Russian tarragon. It’s hardy to zone 4, but the plant can be 
short-lived and may not overwinter.
 
✓ Thyme: Varieties abound, but don’t pass up common thyme for any 
kind of cooking. Hardy to zone 5, thyme likes dry conditions and lots of 
sun. Have fun with unusual varieties like lemon thyme, mint thyme, and 
nutmeg thyme.
Herbs that like cool temperatures
These plants prefer the cool weather of spring and fall and will bolt (produce 
flowers and seed) during hot weather. Once the plant bolts, the flavor of the 
leaves gets bitter. If you’re growing the plants for the leaves, grow them in 
spring and fall. If you’re interested in the seeds, grow the plants in spring so 
they can produce seeds in summer.
 
✓ Cilantro and coriander: These two come from the same plant — the 
fresh leaves are called cilantro; the dried seed is called coriander. For 
a continuous supply of tender, succulent leaves, sow a small bed of 
seed every three weeks starting in early spring and again in fall when 
the weather cools down. Cilantro will bolt when temperatures heat up. 
If you want coriander, let the seeds mature, collect and dry them, and 
you’ll have it.
 
✓ Dill and fennel: Sow seed in early spring and harvest the foliage (“dill 
weed”) at any time. In summer the plant produces flowers and finally dill 
seed — an essential in pickling. The same goes for fennel, a close rela-
tive of dill.

103
 Chapter 8: Plant, Pick, Eat: Vegetables and Herbs
 
✓ Parsley: Choose between curly-leafed and flat-leafed (sometimes called 
Italian) — both are pretty, bright green plants. Parsley grown in cool 
weather has a fresher, brighter flavor; it gets more bitter in hot weather. 
Parsley is biennial, growing one year, and then flowering and setting 
seed the next. Sow seeds every spring (even though sprouting is slow) 
or start with nursery transplants. Parsley has a long taproot, so be sure 
to use a container at least 12 inches deep. Part shade is best.
Heat- and moisture-loving herbs
These plants like the heat of summer; wait a week or two after the average 
last frost date to plant them outdoors so they won’t be stunted by cool tem-
peratures. Unlike Mediterranean herbs like rosemary and thyme, described 
above, the following plants require consistently moist soil (similar to that 
required by most vegetables). Don’t plant them alongside herbs that like soil 
on the dry side or one or the other will suffer; use separate containers so you 
can cater to each plant’s needs.
 
✓ Basil: Basil is an annual that needs hot weather to grow. Plant seed or 
transplants when you’re sure that the overnight temperatures won’t 
drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and expect to be rewarded with fast-
growing plants and lots of pesto by summer. Fertilize moderately with 
nitrogen. Many types are available (cinnamon, Thai, lemon, globe); all 
do well in pots.
 
✓ Stevia: All the rage now, stevia is called “the sweet herb,” and if you’ve 
ever tasted it, you know why. In its native Paraguay, it has been used 
as a sweetener for hundreds of years. Grow your own stevia plants so 
you can drop a leaf or two in your tea, and enjoy watching your friends’ 
faces when you give them a leaf to chew and they’re hit with that super 
sweetness. Stevia likes warm temperatures, so wait to plant until warm 
weather arrives in earnest. Plants grown from seed vary in sweetness, 
so if you’re looking for the sweetest of the sweet, start with purchased 
plants.

Bulbs to Brighten Your Space
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a quick course in bulb botany
▶ Planting bulbs in containers
▶ Choosing bulbs for every season
Just imagine a 2-foot-diameter bowl of bright red tulips all abloom against 
a backdrop of dark green conifers. Or what about a single, intensely 
fragrant hyacinth perfuming your whole kitchen . . . in February! The most 
spectacular container gardening that you ever do may involve bulbs. Bulbs 
require us to play by a different set of rules than other plants, and they take 
extra patience and careful timing. But the rewards are worth it!
Bulbs are perennials: They store food underground that allows them to sur-
vive a dormant period and resprout months later. So why are we grouping 
them with annual plants for single-season containers? Because most garden-
ers treat them as annuals. Many bulbs take a while to reach the bloom stage 
after planting, and then have relatively short bloom seasons. Tulips, for 
example, need months to grow roots and leaves, but then bloom for just a 
few weeks. When they’re in bloom, they’re spectacular. But after that they’re 
just leaves that begin to yellow and wither after a month or so. When that 
happens, most gardeners opt to replace them with annual flowers, instead of 
treating them as perennials to be kept year to year.
In this chapter you find a short botany lesson on bulbs and bulblike plants, 
planting tips, and a rundown of some of the most popular bulbs for every 
season.
Brushing Up on Bulb Basics
The discussion of bulbs in this chapter (and elsewhere in this book) includes 
types of plants that are not, botanically speaking, true bulbs, but that per-
form pretty much the same. Corms, rhizomes, tubers, and tuberous roots, 
like true bulbs, are underground food storage systems with dormant buds 

106
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
that, when environmental conditions are right, sprout foliage and produce 
flowers. Then they die back to the ground, go through a dormant or resting 
period, and then resprout.
The most familiar bulbs, like tulips and daffodils, are planted in fall and bloom 
in spring. Some less-typical bulbs bloom at other times of the year, but are 
plenty worthwhile in their own right. For example, you can plant summer-
blooming bulbs (including calla lily, canna, and tuberous begonia) in spring for 
summer or early fall bloom. Plant fall-blooming bulbs, such as colchicum and 
autumn crocus, in late August or September; flowers appear just weeks later.
Like other plants that have evolved to overwinter or endure a dormant 
period, bulbs vary in hardiness. The spring bloomers tend to be the hardi-
est; most will survive in regions as cold as zones 4 or 5 when planted in the 
garden (although they’re less hardy in containers; more on that in a minute). 
Many summer bloomers are tropical in origin, so they must be protected 
from winter’s cold. Fall bloomers tend to be relatively cold hardy. Because 
they require different care, it makes sense to categorize them according to 
when they’re planted and when they bloom. The sections later in the chapter 
list bulbs grouped by season. But first, we give you some general advice that 
applies to all bulbs.
Containers and Bulbs: 
A Great Partnership
Most bulbs bloom for just a few weeks. Then, when the plants are finished 
blooming and the foliage begins to yellow, bulb plants start to look ragged. 
You can’t cut off the foliage until it has fully died back or you reduce the food 
reserves in the bulbs. So most gardeners plant early-sprouting, fast-growing 
shrubby perennials like daylilies to hide the unsightly bulb foliage as it ripens.
Planting bulbs in containers solves this problem. After planting, you can 
store the containers out of sight during the first several months as the bulbs 
grow roots and begin to sprout. Then, when the flowers are at their peak, you 
can place the containers nearby for close-up viewing (and smelling, in the 
case of the beautifully scented types such as hyacinths and narcissus). After 
the blooms have faded, you can pull out the bulbs and replant the container 
with other flowers.
 
Planting just one bulb variety per pot ensures that all the bulbs in the pot will 
bloom at the same time. Mixing varieties in a container, on the other hand, 
results in flowers coming at different times, which has much less impact. If 
you want different flower colors and bloom times, grow different varieties in 
separate containers.

107
 Chapter 9: Bulbs to Brighten Your Space
The following sections give you the lowdown on making bulbs feel and look 
at home in a container.
Choosing the container
Bulbs look fine in a wide variety of container shapes and styles. As a general 
rule, spring bulbs are planted in the ground at a depth three times their diam-
eter, but that rule doesn’t have to apply to short-term container growing. 
Choose containers that allow at least 2 inches of soil beneath the bulbs.
The traditional container in which to grow spring-blooming bulbs like hya-
cinths is a clay or plastic bulb pan, a shallow pot l0 inches or larger in diam-
eter and only 5 or so inches deep. These pots don’t hold much soil, so they 
aren’t candidates for replanting with other flowers.
Shopping for bulbs
You can buy bulbs at a local nursery or garden center or by mail order. The 
nursery bins and bags give you a chance to personally inspect the bulbs for 
quality — always important! But perhaps more than any other plant, durable 
and compact bulbs lend themselves to mail-order delivery.
 
When you order from reputable suppliers, you can rest assured that you’ll 
receive high-quality bulbs. And you know that they’ve been stored in the 
proper conditions, usually a cool warehouse, rather than sitting out in an 
overheated store display. Plus, mail order generally offers the widest selection 
of varieties.
The bulbs that you see for sale at nurseries have been dug up at their most 
dormant stage — with no root or top growth. Spring bulbs are dug in summer 
for fall planting. Garden centers begin displaying different types of bulbs 
right before their proper planting time. Mail-order companies encourage you 
to order months ahead — often with significant discounts — and then they 
ship the bulbs to you at the proper planting time.
 
The bloom season for most bulbs can be short, two or three weeks at best for 
daffodils and tulips. (But isn’t that why we love bulbs — for their fleeting burst 
of beauty in the spring garden?) If you want a longer bloom season, check out 
the bloom dates of the bulbs you buy. Daffodil and tulip varieties, for example, 
are described as early-, mid-, and late-season, relative to the average bloom 
time for that plant. (Because daffodils bloom before tulips, even late-season 
daffodils may be finished blooming before early-season tulips get started.) For 
an extended bloom season, choose varieties with staggered bloom dates, 
planting each type in its own container so you can display them at peak bloom.

Keep these tips in mind as you shop for bulbs:
 
✓ Buying earlier is better than waiting. When you pick out your bulbs as 
soon as they hit the nurseries or catalogs, you get a much better selec-
tion of varieties. And at this time, the bulbs aren’t picked over, with just 
the runts remaining. If you’re not yet ready to plant, keep your bulbs 
in a cool dark place, with good air circulation and temperatures ideally 
between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 Don’t store bulbs and fruits together in an enclosed place. For example, 
if you store your bulbs in the refrigerator, don’t put them in the vegeta-
ble crisper alongside a bag of apples. Ripening fruits emit ethylene gas 
which can damage the bulbs.
 
✓ Bigger is better than smaller. The size of the bulb indicates the amount 
of food stored to provide energy for later regrowth. Bigger bulbs (graded 
number 1 or called topsize or topgrade) usually produce bigger flowers, 
more flowers, and taller, thicker stems than smaller bulbs, which are 
sometimes called landscape grade or field grade. Smaller bulbs at a good 
price may make sense if you plant them in the ground where they can 
develop over several years, but they aren’t a good choice for containers, 
where the bulbs usually can thrive only for one season.
 
✓ Plump is better than scrawny. Follow the same rule for choosing a bulb 
as you do for choosing a good grapefruit: The bulb should feel heavy for 
its size. A bulb that feels light may have lost moisture.
 
✓ Firm is better than squishy. To what in the world does this rule not 
apply? You don’t want to buy rotting bulbs.
 
✓ Two noses are better than one. This rule applies primarily to daffodils 
and perhaps some Picasso paintings. Daffodil bulbs develop noses, or 
little bulbs attached to the main bulb, each of which can produce leaves 
and flowers. Try to buy big fat bulbs with two or three noses.
Preparing the soil
For container-grown bulbs, you want a mix that’s well drained but that holds 
adequate moisture. Most commercial potting mixes work well, as we describe 
in Chapter 4. Because the bulb itself is a food storage structure, bulbs that 
grow only one season need little or no fertilizer. A soil mix that contains 
starter fertilizer is adequate, or you can mix in a small amount of bulb fertil-
izer at planting time. (See Chapter 16 for more on fertilizers.)

Planting the bulbs — step by step
The following steps describe the typical way to plant bulbs. Expect the 
results to be containers dense with flowers. (Some bulbs require different 
techniques — see individual bulb descriptions for details.)
 
1. Figure out which end is up.
 
 If you plant bulbs upside down or sideways, you’re asking them to waste 
time and energy taking a circuitous run to daylight. Examine your bulbs 
for root remnants at the base — that end goes down.
 
2. Fill your pot partway full of soil mix — enough so that bulbs placed 
upright on this layer end up with their tops 1 inch below the rim of 
the pot.
 
3. As shown in Figure 9-1, space bulbs so that they’re gently touching or 
no more than 1⁄2 inch apart, and press the base of the bulbs into the 
soil to keep them standing straight.
 
 Place any larger bulbs at the center of the group.
 
Figure 9-1: 
In general, 
bulbs should 
be no more 
than 1⁄2 inch 
apart and 
about 1 inch 
below the 
rim of the 
pot.
 
 
4. Fill in around the bulbs, and barely cover the tops of the bulbs with 
soil mix.
 
5. Water gently with a watering can or hose set at a trickle until the soil 
mix is fully moistened.

Some spring-blooming bulbs require a special chilling period before they’ll 
grow and bloom; you find details in the next section.
Bulbs Through the Seasons
Bulbs aren’t just for spring anymore. Although spring bloomers provide 
extravagant color when little else is in bloom, don’t overlook bulbs that 
bloom in other seasons. Here’s a rundown of bulbs for all seasons.
Spring-blooming bulbs
The bulbs that you’re most likely to be familiar with are the classic spring 
bloomers, such as tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, and crocuses. They create a 
blaze of color just when it’s most welcome — late winter and early spring. 
Nothing else announces spring more emphatically and lyrically.
Here’s their routine, whether they’re growing in the ground or in containers:
 
1. You plant the bulbs in fall.
 
2. Using stored food for energy, the bulbs grow roots through the winter.
 
3. Top growth emerges in late winter or early spring.
 
4. Flowers burst into bloom in spring for a couple of weeks, and then dry up.
 
5. Foliage continues to grow, replenishing the underground bulb’s food 
supply. If you dig up a bulb at bloom time, you find it scrawny compared 
with the plump one you planted.
 
6. When the foliage is done growing and replenishing the underground 
food supply, the leaves turn brown and die back. The bulb is plump 
again with stored food. It sits dormant underground, ready to sprout 
and bloom again the next spring.
The cold stage in Step 2 is critical for these bulbs to produce nice blooms 
come spring. The following section explains how you can reproduce a big 
chill for your container garden of spring bulbs. Then we list some spring-
blooming bulbs.
Creating a bulb-chilling experience
Most spring-blooming bulbs are very hardy and will overwinter in the ground 
in all but the most frigid climates. In fact, they need this chill period to induce 
blooming. However, like other plants, when they’re grown in containers they 

111
 Chapter 9: Bulbs to Brighten Your Space
more readily succumb to extreme chill because soil in a container gets much 
colder than the soil in the garden. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on climate 
and containers.) So gardeners in very cold climates need to take special 
steps to give their container bulbs just the right amount of chill.
After you plant the bulbs as outlined in the “Planting the bulbs — step by 
step” section, you need to follow the steps given here to ensure your spring 
bulbs will produce beautiful blooms:
 
1. Place the containers where the temperature remains cool, ideally 
between 35 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit, to mimic the soil temperature 
if they were planted in the garden.
 
 Where you put them depends on your climate. Where late fall and early 
winter temperatures stay in this 35- to 45-degree range, just move the 
planted containers into a cool, shady spot and leave them alone. In 
places where fall and winter temperatures fluctuate, rising above and 
falling below this range, you need to take an extra step: Wait for a spell 
of 40-degree weather so the soil and bulbs are at just the right tem-
perature for proper chilling, and then mulch the containers on all sides 
and on top with a thick layer of straw. This will insulate the containers 
against temperature fluctuations and hold in the right amount of chill.
 
 In colder climates, providing the proper amount of chill is more chal-
lenging. You need to find a place where the containers won’t freeze but 
will remain in that 35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit range. This may be in 
an unheated garage, under a heated porch, or in a cold basement. You 
need to monitor the temperature and move the containers to a warmer 
or cooler spot if necessary. See the sidebar “Chilling out in warm-winter 
climates” for tips on growing spring-blooming bulbs in regions where 
temperatures remain above 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 Most spring bulbs need between 8 and 15 weeks of chilling for best 
blooms.
 
2. Inspect containers every week, watering if necessary to keep soil 
slightly moist.
 
 You’ll start to see green shoots emerging from the soil in two or three 
months, depending upon the type of bulb and its chilling requirements.
 
3. If you live in a climate with moderate winters, the appearance of the 
shoots in the container may coincide with the emergence of bulbs in 
outdoor beds. If so, you can move the containers outdoors.
 
 If you live in a cold-winter region, keep the containers in their cool place 
for a few more weeks — the extra chilling won’t hurt them. Bring them 
outdoors once bulbs in outdoor beds are beginning to emerge.

112
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
 
4. When flower buds start to show color, move containers into their dis-
play positions.
 
5. Water bulbs as needed to keep soil moist throughout the whole depth 
of the container.
After the bulbs are finished blooming, you have a few options.
 
✓ You can discard them.
 
✓ You can move the pots to an out-of-the-way area and keep them watered 
and fertilized so the foliage can replenish the bulbs. When the leaves 
have died back cut them off an inch above the soil line. Then remove the 
bulbs from the pots, let them air dry, shake or brush off the loose soil, 
and store them in a cool, dark place for the rest of the summer. Plant 
them out in the garden in fall.
 
 Use fresh bulbs in your containers every year. Bulbs that have been 
growing in a container typically don’t do as well if you plant them in a 
container for a second time. If you want to keep the bulbs, plant them in 
the garden and use new bulbs for your container.
 
✓ You can carefully transplant the bulbs into the garden and let the foliage 
die back naturally.
Selecting spring-blooming bulbs
Here’s a rundown of some popular bulbs, with specific planting instructions 
and suggestions for postbloom uses.
 
✓ Crocus: Welcome as the first sign of spring in many places, the small, 
goblet-like flowers come in many colors, including blue, purple, white, 
and bicolors. The look is most effective when you pack several crocus 
bulbs into a small container. Plant 2 inches deep, with the small corms 
touching. Chill requirement: 12 to 14 weeks.
 
✓ Daffodils/narcissus: Daffodils are the most popular spring bulbs, and 
for good reason. They’re easy to grow and look smashing when crowded 
into a container. Hundreds of species and varieties are available, in a 
range of colors including bi-colors, but how can you pass up tried-and-
true yellows? King Alfred, big-flowered and bright yellow, is an all-time 
hero and still a great choice. Smaller types are sometimes referred to as 
narcissus.
 
 A dozen daffodil bulbs in a 12-inch-diameter clay pot make an impressive 
showing. Place the bulbs with their sides touching and tips level with 
the soil’s surface. Chill requirement: 12 to 14 weeks.

113
 Chapter 9: Bulbs to Brighten Your Space
 
✓ Grape hyacinth (Muscari): Neither hyacinths nor grapes, grape hya-
cinths nonetheless herald early spring with spikes topped with clusters 
of little blue or white flowers. The delicate flowers and foliage show off 
best in a small, shallow (5 or 6 inches in diameter and depth) pot. Plant 
the bulbs close together, and cover them lightly with soil mix. Chill 
requirement: 15 weeks.
 
✓ Hyacinth: Famously fragrant spikes of blue, white, or pink flowers can 
grow so large that they can tip over a small pot. Buy the biggest bulbs 
available. Plant them in a heavy clay pot that’s at least 10 inches wide 
and about 5 inches deep. Arrange them so the sides of bulbs are almost 
touching; cover lightly with soil mix. Don’t expect much from the bulbs 
in subsequent years, even if you move them into the garden. Chill 
requirement: 12 weeks.
 
✓ Iris: Bulbous iris (not the familiar bearded iris) are good in contain-
ers. These include Dutch, English, and Spanish types, with flowers in 
many colors. Wedgwood is a favorite Dutch iris with big blue and yellow 
blooms. Plant bulbs 1 to 2 inches deep, six or eight to an 8-inch pot. Chill 
requirement: 14 weeks.
 
✓ Tulip: Tulips are probably the most impressive bulbs that you can grow 
in your containers. They’re always classy, if a bit regimental when the 
whole pot full blooms all at once, with the same height and color. Many, 
many colors and flower forms are available. Follow the directions for 
typical spring bulbs, and you’ll find that tulips grow and bloom almost 
automatically in containers. But expect little from them in following 
years, in the ground or in containers. Tulips look best when bulbs are 
packed tight. Plant with sides nearly touching and tips just below soil 
surface. Chill requirement: 15 weeks.
Chilling out in warm-winter climates
In mild-winter climates (in much of California 
and Florida, for example), you have to simulate 
the conditions that spring-blooming bulbs need 
and naturally enjoy in cold climates. Without a 
certain amount of chilling, bulbs (particularly 
tulips and hyacinths) produce small and insub-
stantial flowers.
If chilling is necessary where you live, in mid-
September put the unplanted bulbs in a paper 
bag and place it in your refrigerator, keeping 
the bulbs away from ripening fruit. Leave them 
there for about eight weeks, and then take them 
out of the refrigerator and plant them in your 
containers. After planting, water the contain-
ers and place them outdoors in a cool, shady 
spot so the bulbs can grow roots and finish their 
chilling. You should start seeing green shoots 
by late winter. Sometimes you can find pre-
chilled bulbs for sale.

114
Part II: Enjoying a Summer Fling with Single-Season Containers 
The bulbs of summer
Summer bulbs originate in tropical to subtropical regions and won’t tolerate 
the cold winter weather experienced by most regions. Plant them in spring 
for bloom during the summer. Either discard them at the end of the season 
or dig up and store the bulbs in a cool-but-not-freezing place over the winter 
to replant the next spring.
 
✓ Caladium: With its big, jungly-looking leaves splotched with pink, white, 
and red, this bulb adds a tropical feeling to a garden. Plant tubers, one 
per pot, even with the top of the soil.
 
✓ Calla (Zantedeschia): Choose the common white or any of the many 
bright hybrids in yellow, pink, and red. All have the familiar cup-shaped 
flowers. Plant rhizomes 2 inches deep, 1 per 6-inch pot.
 
✓ Canna: Expect bright, flashy flowers and big, tropical-looking leaves. 
Most cannas grow tall, but for container gardening, look for dwarf variet-
ies. Plant rhizomes 2 to 4 inches deep in containers at least 12 inches 
wide, 14 or 15 inches deep.
Force the issue with your spring-blooming bulbs
To brighten the dreariest winter days with 
sweet fragrance and spring colors, you can 
force (or trick) bulbs into blooming early 
indoors. Your best bets for forcing early blooms 
are crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths, grape hya-
cinths, and tulips.
Because you have to move containers indoors 
when you force a bloom, you probably want 
smaller pots than for outdoor use. For example, 
try half a dozen tulips or daffodils in a 6- to 
10-inch pot; one daffodil or tulip or three small 
bulbs (such as crocus) in a 4-inch pot.
Follow the preceding steps for planting these 
bulbs in containers. Plant them at the usual time 
in fall and set them somewhere appropriate for 
their chilling period. After two or three months 
(usually after New Year’s Day) you should see 
signs of growth. When they show 2- to 6-inch 
sprouts, bring the pots indoors to a cool room 
(60 degrees or so) to fool bulbs into “thinking” 
that spring is here! A week or two later, when 
sprouts have buds that show a little color, 
move the bulbs into normal room temperature 
in a spot that gets as much sunlight as possible. 
Flowers should appear within the next week or 
so. Continue to keep the soil moist. The cooler 
the room, the longer the blooms will last.
When the plant finishes blooming, discard the 
bulbs. Getting bulbs that have been forced into 
early bloom to grow and rebloom in the garden 
is difficult.

115
 Chapter 9: Bulbs to Brighten Your Space
 
✓ Dahlia: This is a huge group of plants, from foot-tall dwarfs to strap-
ping 6-footers, from quarter-sized flowers to dinner-plate dimensions 
for entering in the county fair. Dwarfs and intermediate types are best 
for containers; bigger plants require stakes. Plant tuberous roots 3 to 5 
inches deep, 1 root to a 10- to 12-inch pot, 3 roots to a 14- to 16-inch pot.
 
✓ Gladiolus: Producing tall spikes of vibrantly colored flowers, gladioluses 
are usually grown for use as cut flowers, but the shorter “border gladi-
oluses” are attractive in containers. Plant the corms about 6 inches deep 
and 4 inches apart.
 
✓ Glory lily (Gloriosa rothschildsiana): Beautiful red and yellow flowers 
bloom on a distinctive climbing plant. Provide a trellis to support this 
very tender bulb. Plant tubers 4 inches deep, 1 to each container at least 
8 inches in diameter.
 
✓ Tiger flower (Tigridia): This flamboyant heat-lover comes from Mexico. 
Plant the bulbs 2 to 4 inches deep and 4 inches apart in a container at 
least 8 inches in diameter.
 
✓ Tuberous begonia: Great for containers (especially hanging baskets) in 
part shade, this plant is a favorite among hobbyist growers. Its richly 
colored flowers come in a variety of forms and sizes. For best results, 
plant begonias indoors about 8 weeks before the last spring frost date, 
setting the tubers concave side up about an inch deep in the soil. Keep 
the pot in a warm place and water sparingly, just enough to keep the soil 
slightly moist.
Fall bulbs
When you think about fall and bulbs, you usually think about planting daffo-
dils and tulips, not enjoying blossoms. But there are two bulbs you can plant 
in early fall and enjoy their flowers just a few weeks later. Transplant them 
into the garden after they’re done blooming.
 
✓ Fall crocus: Several species of crocus bloom in fall rather than spring. 
The foliage emerges soon after planting, followed by the familiar goblet-
shaped flowers. Plant them in July and August, setting them about 6 
inches deep in well-drained potting mix.
 
✓ Colchicum: These beautiful, vase-shaped flowers resemble crocuses but 
are larger. The blooms emerge just weeks after planting. Foliage appears 
in spring, grows for a few months, then dies back. Plant them 4 inches 
deep in August and September.

116

Winter wonders
For many gardeners, the winter holidays wouldn’t seem right without regal 
amaryllis and fragrant paper whites. Plant these tropical bulbs indoors in fall 
for winter bloom. Neither requires a chilling period.
 
✓ Amaryllis (Hippeastrum): Monster-size flowers, up to 8 inches across, 
sit atop tall stems. Plant a single bulb in a heavy clay (less chance for 
toppling), 8-inch pot, setting it so that about a quarter of the bulb sticks 
out of soil. Keep it at room temperature and keep the soil moist, and 
expect flowers in seven to ten weeks. After the flowers fade, cut off the 
flower stalk and place the plant in a bright window. Keep it watered and 
fertilized. After all danger of frost is past, move the plant outdoors to 
a spot in part sun and continue to let the foliage grow. In late summer, 
stop watering and fertilizing to allow the plant to go dormant for a few 
months. Bring it indoors before the first fall frost, and in early October 
begin watering and fertilizing again. It should bloom again in a few 
months.
 
✓ Paper white narcissus: Unlike other narcissus (daffodils), paper whites 
need no prechilling, making them easy to force into bloom indoors. 
The flowers are fragrant, with a strong, sweet-musky scent. Plant them 
so that their tips are exposed above the soil line, setting them close so 
they’re almost touching each other. Keep them in a bright, cool room; 
they grow quickly and will bloom in as little as four weeks. Discard after 
bloom.

Haul: Permanent 
Plantings

In this part . . .
N
ow it’s time to expand your garden palette to 
include plants that come back year after year. We’re 
talking perennial plants here — hostas and hellebores, 
coneflowers and coreopsis. In these permanent plantings, 
woody plants can take center stage — azaleas, hollies, 
Japanese maples, even dwarf fruit trees. Most indoor 
plants also live for several years (some for decades!) so 
we’ve included them here, too. Plants like these represent 
a significant investment, so you’ll want to choose plants 
carefully and give them the care they need. Read on for 
details.

Chapter 10
Pondering Permanent Plantings
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out all about perennials
▶ Working with Mother Nature
▶ Protecting your plants in cold-winter climates
W
hy bother with permanent plantings — perennials, trees, and 
shrubs — when annuals bloom so abundantly and don’t require 
overwintering? When vegetables grow so easily and provide a healthy 
harvest? The main reason is that permanent plantings expand your plant 
palette exponentially.
As much as we hate to resort to such a vague and overused word, we have to 
say that the plants you can grow in permanent plantings are interesting. And 
that’s the main reason to grow them. They’re interesting in the range of flow-
ers they provide — from tiny, fragrance-packed lavender to towering blue del-
phiniums. They’re interesting in their sheer numbers and variety — thousands 
of kinds are available, including grasses, shade plants, foliage plants, shrubs, 
trees, and vines. And they’re interesting in the challenges that they present: 
from pruning and dividing to figuring out what to do with them in the winter — 
you don’t just relegate them to the compost pile at the end of the season as 
you do annuals.
This chapter gives you an overview of the different types of perennial plants 
you can grow. We also point out some problems that microclimates can pres-
ent when it comes to keeping plants in containers year-round, but, of course, 
we help you with some solutions too. Finally, we offer ways to protect your 
permanent plantings from harsh winter weather.
Getting Acquainted with Perennials
What kind of plants go into a permanent planting? In a word, perennial 
plants — plants that grow for more than one season. In this book we 
describe four groups of permanent plants:

120
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Herbaceous perennials: These are plants with more or less soft, suc-
culent growth. They die back to the ground in winter and resprout in 
spring. Primroses, penstemons, and peonies are examples of herbaceous 
perennials. When people use the term perennials, they’re usually refer-
ring to herbaceous perennials. (Chapter 11 covers these in more detail.)
 
✓ Woody plants: Technically speaking, trees, shrubs, and woody vines 
are perennial plants, too, in that they grow for more than one season, 
but most people call them . . . well . . . trees, shrubs, and vines. These 
plants have hardened woody parts that persist above-ground in winter. 
(Woody plants are the stars of Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Fruits and berries: Although these fall into one of the preceding cat-
egories, they merit a special mention because they’re so popular and 
rewarding to grow, and because they have special requirements. (Get 
your fill of specifics on fruits and berries in Chapter 13. Sweet!)
 
✓ Indoor plants: We include houseplants in the permanent plantings sec-
tion of this book because they generally grow for more than one season, 
too. Most houseplants are tropical perennials that need warm tempera-
tures to thrive. (Check out Chapter 14 for what you need to know to suc-
cessfully grow houseplants.)
So, you have lots of choices when it comes to potting up perennials. In the 
following sections, we list some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
making a commitment to perennials.
Good reasons to grow perennials
Ask gardeners why they love permanent plantings, and here’s what you can 
expect to hear (in addition to how interesting they are):
 
✓ They last longer. Many gardeners prefer to fill their pots with perennial 
plants simply because the plants can last a long time. There’s no need to 
replant your containers each year, as you must do with annuals.
 
✓ Bigger can be better. Herbaceous perennials tend to grow larger than 
annuals and bulbs, so they can fill large spaces if that’s what you want. 
And trees and shrubs grow even bigger. If you really want to make a 
splash with your container plantings, you’ll probably want to include a 
few big specimens.
 
✓ They provide year-round interest. Annuals offer bright, short-lived flow-
ers, but if you want something that adds interest season after season, 
year after year, you’ll want to include something perennial.
 
 Evergreens and woody plants with intriguing shapes and colorful bark 
are especially useful in these situations, because they offer something to 
look at year-round.

121
 Chapter 10: Pondering Permanent Plantings
Challenges perennials pose
Alas, there are a few downsides to permanent plantings:
 
✓ They have down times. Just as we all look a little ratty from time-to-
time, permanent plantings often do, too — like when perennial flowers 
aren’t blooming or when the leaves fall off deciduous plants.
 
 For year-round interest in perennial plantings, include at least one plant 
that has something pleasing to the eye in winter. This may be an ever-
green plant, a woody shrub with colorful bark, an ornamental grass with 
attractive seed heads, or a tree with an interesting branch structure. 
That way, when other plants have finished flowering or have died back 
for the winter, you’ll have something nice to look at.
 
✓ They require a bit more care. Unlike annuals, permanent plantings 
require some year-round care. In addition to watering and fertilizing, 
you’ll be pruning them, moving them to protected spots for winter in 
cold-climate areas, and periodically dividing or repotting them.
 
✓ They’re more expensive upfront. Herbaceous perennials often compare 
in price to annuals, but you’ll spend considerably more on trees and 
shrubs. And larger plants mean larger containers, too, which also jacks 
up the final bill. Remember, though, that you won’t need to replant each 
spring as you would with annuals, so factor in that long-term cost savings.
Taking Mother Nature into Account
Annuals are easy. When a hard freeze or other extreme weather indicates 
that the growing season is over, you just say goodbye to the plants and toss 
them into the compost pile. You’re done until next spring. Perennial plant-
ings, on the other hand, need your attention to protect them from Mother 
Nature’s whims and cycles. After all, you’ve probably invested a fair bit of 
time and money in these plants and containers.
In the following sections, we explain how microclimates can work for or 
against your permanent container plants, and we offer some suggestions for 
helping your permanent plants survive winter weather.
Taking advantage of microclimates
One way to fool Mother Nature — or work with her instead of against her — 
is to make the best use of your landscape’s microclimates. You may have 
noticed spots in your landscape that are warmer in winter, cooler in summer, 
or especially windy. These are microclimates — areas where the conditions 

122
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
are a little different than those in the rest of the yard. Flip back to Chapter 2 
for general information on microclimates. Here we take a look at why they’re 
particularly important for permanent plantings.
Microclimates can spell the difference between a planter that thrives during 
the growing season, overwinters, and comes back in full force in spring and 
one that succumbs to extreme heat, cold winter temperatures, or wind.
 
All plants have preferences for sun and shade, temperature and humidity, and 
other weather and climate factors. Knowing the preferences of the plants in 
your permanent plantings is especially important. The following sections pro-
vide a few explanations for why this is so.
Dormancy
Herbaceous perennials and woody plants take cues from nature as to when 
it’s time to start winding down and entering dormancy at the end of the grow-
ing season. As the weather cools and daylight lessens, plants begin withdraw-
ing food reserves from their leaves and stems and storing these reserves in 
their roots. Plants need enough stored energy in their roots to survive winter 
and begin growing next spring. Some plants also concentrate sugars in their 
buds to keep them from freezing solid.
Container plants placed against a sun-drenched wall receive lots of reflected 
light and heat. This can fool plants into “thinking” that it’s still summer even 
when winter is fast approaching. They may continue to grow at full tilt — 
until they’re blasted by the first hard freeze. The solution? In late summer, 
help plants know it’s time to slow down by moving containers to a spot 
where they don’t receive so much reflected light and heat.
Freeze/thaw cycles
Even plants in the ground are subject to alternating freeze/thaw cycles, when 
temperatures are very warm one day and very cold the next. Weather like 
this can confuse plants and prevent them from entering dormancy. And when 
soil repeatedly freezes and thaws, it also expands and contracts, which can 
heave plants, pushing them right up and out of the soil where their roots can 
freeze or dry out.
Because the soil in container plants is more exposed to the elements, it’s 
more likely to be subject to these freeze/thaw cycles. The solution? Add a 
thick layer of insulating mulch to the soil of container plantings, and consider 
moving plants to a shadier spot that doesn’t heat up so much on warm days.
Early bloom
Flowering trees and shrubs, especially some fruit trees, may bloom earlier 
when they’re growing in containers because the soil in containers warms 
up faster than the soil in the ground. If a container is placed in a spot that 
receives reflected sun and heat, the plants may be fooled into blooming 

123
 Chapter 10: Pondering Permanent Plantings
even earlier. If that happens, the buds and flowers may be damaged when 
nighttime temperatures drop, even without an unusual cold spell. This is 
especially true of plants that are marginally hardy in your area. The solution? 
Move these plants to a spot where they’ll stay cooler, rather than warmer, 
until spring has really arrived.
Overwintering containers in cold areas
In cold-winter climate areas, many container-grown perennials, trees, and 
shrubs can’t be left out in the elements — even if the same plants growing in 
the ground are perfectly hardy. When you choose perennials for containers, 
you need to consider their climate adaptability.
Check locally to find out exactly which plants survive outdoors all year 
where you live (you may also learn by trial and error). Review Chapter 2, and 
remember that plants that are hardy in the ground in a certain climate may 
not be hardy in a container. (Add roughly two climate zones. For example, 
if a plant is hardy to zone 5 in the ground, it may be hardy only to zone 7 in 
a container.) A fair prediction is that container plants in cold climates can’t 
survive the winter outdoors without some sort of protection.
 
The hardiness zones for the plants we list in Chapters 11 through 13 refer to 
their hardiness when planted in the ground. There is no firm data for con-
tainer plants that we know of.
Gardeners in cold climates take steps to overwinter their container plants 
(keep them in a protected spot) to shelter them until the milder tempera-
tures of spring arrive. Tropical plants need to be brought indoors into room 
temperatures; treat these as houseplants over the winter. Plants from tem-
perate regions (where the plants normally go dormant in winter), on the 
other hand, need the down time induced by cold weather. For these plants, 
the goal of overwintering isn’t to keep plants warm but rather to keep them 
from getting too cold.
Individual gardeners have their own favorite method of overwintering con-
tainer plants that need a cold-induced dormant period. You can try the fol-
lowing techniques to overwinter cold-sensitive plants that aren’t hardy to 
your region. But we’ll be honest: Not all of these suggestions are simple, and 
none of them are foolproof.
 
✓ After plants are dormant (after herbaceous plants have died back and 
woody deciduous plants have dropped their leaves), water them one 
last time and place the pots in an insulated garage or cool basement. 
Look for a spot that will stay in the range of 32 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Check the plants occasionally, and water them if the soil dries out. Move 
the plants back outdoors in spring.

 If the storage area is likely to drop below freezing, place the containers 
in a large cardboard box and fill it with hay, packing peanuts, or any-
thing else that will provide insulation.
 
✓ For small shrubs and herbaceous perennials, wait until the first hard 
frost. Then bury each plant, still in its pot, in the middle of your mulch 
pile, tilting the pot to make sure water from rain and melting snow will 
drain off. When the weather warms in spring, move the plants back to 
their regular spots.
 
✓ For small to medium-sized plants, wait until they’ve entered dormancy, 
and then create a tall cylinder around the container and plant (using 
chicken wire, wire fencing, or hardware cloth; see Figure 10-1). Fill it 
with chopped leaves, straw, or bark mulch. This will prevent the soil and 
plant from freezing and thawing in winter.
 
✓ In colder zones, you can use the “tip and bury” method on a deciduous 
tree that is normally hardy only to zone 7 (such as a fig tree): Tie the 
branches of the plant together after it loses its leaves, lay it on its side 
in a trench that is 14 inches deep and wide enough to hold the entire 
plant (including the pot). Cover it with burlap, and then cover the 
plant — container and all — with soil. When the soil starts to thaw out 
in April or later, dig out the plant, stand it up, start watering, and see 
whether it responds.

 Chapter 10: Pondering Permanent Plantings
 
Even in regions where winters are chilly but not severe, hardy plants benefit 
from some protection. Group container plants together in a protected area out 
of strong winds and bright sunshine. They’ll shield each other from the ele-
ments and create their own slightly warmer microclimate. Or, after plants 
have entered dormancy, wrap pots with bubble wrap to help insulate soil 
against freeze/thaw cycles.
 
If you live in a cold climate, remember that winter temperatures can affect 
your containers as well as your plants. If left outside, terra-cotta, concrete, 
and ceramic pots with soil in them can crack when moist soil expands as it 
freezes; move these pots into protected areas for the winter. Refer to Chapter 
3 for more details.

W
hy bother with perennial flowers when annuals bloom so abundantly 
and don’t require overwintering? That’s a good question. After 
all, most perennials die back in winter, have a comparatively short bloom 
season, and take a while to get growing in spring. With annuals, you get 
instant color in spring that lasts all summer long.
The short answer to the “why bother” question is that perennials offer a 
huge range of colors, forms, and textures not available in annuals. The longer 
answer is that perennials are fun to grow. In spring, you watch your pots 
with anticipation and rejoice at that first green shoot, knowing your plants 
made it through the winter. And when you grow perennials, you get to be, 
well, different. Potted annual flowers are everywhere — even at the gas sta-
tion. Perennials broaden your plant palette and challenge you as a gardener. 
If you’re still not convinced perennials are worth the trouble, read on. This 
chapter covers the basics of growing perennials and then offers some plants 
for your consideration.
Defining Perennials
In this chapter we’re talking about a specific type of perennial: herbaceous 
flowering perennials. These perennials have soft fleshy stems (as opposed to 
a sturdy, woody trunk like an oak tree) and live for several years under the 
right conditions. Perennials represent a huge and storied population of plants, 
and you can find information about them everywhere from magazine racks 
and library shelves to Web sites, discussion groups, and online retailers.

128
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Some of these perennials are deciduous. They lose their leaves at some point 
in the year, usually in winter, or they die back completely to the ground.
Other perennials are evergreen, especially in mild climates. In cold climates, 
the above-ground parts may die back. In mild places, such as Southern 
California, “annuals” like the popular red-flowered geranium thrive as perma-
nent shrubs. So is the geranium an annual or a perennial? Technically, it’s a 
perennial, but because it isn’t winter-hardy in most of the country, we treat it 
as an annual in this book — refer to Chapter 7. Here we focus on plants that 
are perennial in cooler parts of the country, too.
Perennials generally have one main bloom season, usually in spring or 
summer, that can be as brief as a few weeks or as long as a couple months. 
Plant breeders continue to develop varieties with especially long bloom 
times, but even so, expect perennials to have shorter bloom seasons than 
annuals.
So, what can you do with perennials?
 
✓ Grow the unusual: Everyone and his brother grow petunias and impa-
tiens in their containers. Be the talk of the town by planting something 
different, say, Green Envy echinacea or Caramel coral bells.
 
✓ Grow the temperamental: If your garden beds are too sunny for hostas 
or your soil is too cold and wet for lavender, try growing them in con-
tainers so that you can customize their environments.
 
✓ Mix and match: Want the best of both worlds? Combine unique perenni-
als with favorite annuals.
Putting Perennials and Pots Together
Because of perennials’ longevity, you need to put some thought into the con-
tainers you want to display them in. You may need to plan for a succession of 
containers, and, of course, you have to make sure the perennials are planted 
properly. We give you the lowdown in the following sections.
Matching plants with pots
Imagine those daylilies brightening up your front porch, their silky trumpets 
heralding a soft summer breeze — but what kind of pot shows off their mul-
ticolor magic? And how about that gorgeous Asian urn you discovered at a 
garage sale — what can you grow in it? Sometimes we start with the plant, 
and sometimes we start with the pot — either way can work.

129
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
Along with the aesthetics of matching plants to pots, perennials demand that 
you consider another factor: the plant’s size now and its size at maturity. For 
example, a 4-inch daylily may ultimately spread out to a diameter of 2 feet — 
eventually, you’ll need a very wide pot. But right now, introducing the 4-inch 
plant to a 24-inch pot doesn’t make much sense — especially because you 
risk making your plant very unhappy when all that extra soil creates inhospi-
tably soggy conditions. Remember that in a pot, a perennial may not get quite 
as big as a ground-grown plant, but it may come close.
 
So how do you choose the right size pot for now and later? You have two 
choices: Put that little plant in a 6-inch (or 10-inch) pot and repot it to larger-
size pots as it grows (we give you tips on repotting in the “Dividing and 
Repotting” section later in this chapter), or put it in a pot that can accommo-
date its ultimate size, and add annuals to fill the empty space for now. Make 
sure that the pot you decide to use is large enough to accommodate the ongo-
ing root growth, and heavy and stable enough to remain topple-free as the 
plant matures.
Planting perennials in containers
At nurseries and garden centers, perennials are sold mostly in 4-inch and 
larger nursery pots. To plant these, follow the basic steps outlined in 
Chapter 5. Choose a potting mix that matches the perennial’s normal soil 
requirements (if your plant’s fussy about such things as acidity and alkalin-
ity), and make sure that the mix contains plenty of sand or perlite to ensure 
that it drains quickly.
 
If you buy perennials by mail order, they may arrive as bare-root plants. The 
roots are exposed and devoid of any potting soil — a handy, lightweight 
way to ship perennials and a healthy way to start new plants. Again, refer to 
Chapter 5 for planting instructions.
Caring for Perennials in Containers
Perennials, like all good plants, expect their owners to satisfy their special 
requirements — but these guys, in truth, aren’t terribly demanding. Keep in 
mind that the only plants that don’t require some care are dead plants. The 
following sections cover some special care requirements that are specific to 
perennials.

130
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Deadheading to keep the blooms coming
Flowering perennials share a common goal with all other plants — they live to 
make more plants. When you see a perennial whose flowers are fading, remem-
ber that you’re seeing a natural process — after it flowers, the plant produces 
seeds. Your goal, on the other hand, is probably to enjoy the flowers.
 
When the blooms fade, if the plant is still growing strong, you can encourage a 
new flush of flowers by deadheading. To deadhead, pinch or cut off the fading 
flowers right where the flowers attach to the stems (Figure 7-1 in Chapter 7 
shows you where to pinch). After you deadhead, the plant doesn’t have to 
put its energy into setting seed; instead, the plant can concentrate on making 
more flowers — just what you want. When you’re removing spent flowers, take 
care not to damage nearby buds. On plants with multiple flowers on a single 
stem, like daylilies, it’s easiest to wait until all the flowers on a stem have fin-
ished blooming before cutting the stem off at the base.
 
Not all perennials require deadheading to continue blooming. And some 
plants stop blooming after a certain period no matter how religiously you 
deadhead; that’s just the nature of perennials.
Cutting back for more growth
Some plants grow stronger and bloom better after you cut them back. If you 
cut back leggy stems as much as halfway, they usually come back fuller and 
bushier with more blooms. Some plants are best cut back in fall, others in 
spring. Recommendations for cutting back perennials in pots are the same as 
for perennials in the ground. Because there are many types of perennials and 
pruning techniques may vary by region, we don’t have enough room to cover 
them all here. Check with a local nursery for advice on timing and how much 
to cut a particular plant back in your area.
Fertilizing for slow, steady growth
Because perennials and annuals grow differently, you need to fertilize them 
differently. Annuals grow quickly and bloom continually the entire grow-
ing season — they need a fertilizer that’s available quickly and continually. 
Perennials grow more slowly and over a far longer period of time. Hence, 
they need a fertilizer that lasts longer. Starting with a potting mix that has 
been fortified with compost provides a good soil environment and some long-
lasting nutrients. Mixing in some slow-release fertilizers before planting may 
provide enough nutrients for the first growing season.

131
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
In subsequent seasons, an annual application of a slow-release fertilizer in 
spring may be enough. Some gardeners like to feed weekly with a dilute solu-
tion. Aim for slow, steady growth. Too much fertilizer stimulates rapid but 
weak growth that can be susceptible to pest attack (see Chapter 18).
 
As a general rule for fertilizing perennials in containers, find out what specific 
varieties need in your area, and feed just a bit more than you’d deliver to the 
same plants in the ground. The extra food accounts for the loss of nutrients 
washed out during watering of container plants. For more details on fertilizing 
in general, see Chapter 16.
 
Whatever fertilizing method you choose, stop fertilizing by late summer to 
help signal plants to slow growth and begin entering dormancy.
Dividing and Repotting
Because perennials tend to grow larger — in some cases much larger — than 
annuals, you may find your plants outgrowing their pots. (A sure sign is roots 
that fill all available soil space or bulge out at the top. An even surer sign: 
roots bursting the sides of the container.) At times like these, you need to 
make some choices. You can repot them into larger containers, you can root-
prune them and replant them in the same container, or you can divide them. 
Repotting and root pruning are covered in Chapter 17. Dividing is unique to 
herbaceous perennials, so we cover it here.
Some perennials, like coral bells and hostas, spread by underground roots. 
In pots, they can eventually grow so crowded that they no longer look good 
or grow well. When your plants enlarge to this size, think about dividing the 
clump. The ideal time to divide a plant depends on the type of plant and your 
locale. In general, in regions with mild to moderate winters you can divide 
plants in early spring or fall. In regions with very cold winters, most plants 
are best divided in early spring. In regions with very hot summers, divide 
plants in fall. Exceptions to these guidelines exist, so if you’re unsure, do 
some research before digging in.
To divide a perennial:
 
1. Ease the plant from the pot.
 
2. Wash off as much soil as possible — you need to be able to see the 
roots.
 
3. Using a trowel, garden knife, or whatever tool seems to work for you, 
gently tease apart the root mass into two or more clumps.
 
 These clumps are called divisions. Be sure that each division has a 
healthy set of roots to support it.

132
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Repot each clump into a new pot using the bare-root potting procedure 
described in Chapter 5. You can also plant some or all the clumps in the 
ground if you have the space and the right conditions. Or, share or swap divi-
sions with your friends and neighbors.
 
The roots of some plants are such a tangled mass that it’s impossible to tease 
them apart. In these cases, use a sharp knife or, for large plants, a sharpened 
spade to slice the plant in half, from top to bottom, so that the two remaining 
sections contain both top growth (or where the top growth was if the plant is 
dormant) and roots. Replant as you would a regular potted plant.
Choosing Perennials for Containers
The following popular perennials qualify as good candidates for container 
gardening. Everything on the list blooms for a fairly long season and is rela-
tively easy to grow. Most of these plants can work alone in containers or can 
be combined with annuals or other perennials (as long as their sun/shade 
and soil moisture requirements are similar). Hardiness zones are noted for 
each plant (read more about hardiness zones in Chapter 2); however, keep in 
mind that the hardiness ratings are for plants growing in the ground and that 
plants growing in containers may need winter protection. (Tender perennials 
that are grown as annuals in most parts of the country are not listed here — 
we include them in Chapter 7.)
 
Don’t be limited by the upcoming lists. Nearly any perennial can grow in a 
container if you’re willing to work with it. If you’re new to gardening, start 
with something easy. When you’re ready to expand your plant horizons, visit 
garden centers and botanical gardens, talk to fellow gardeners, and consult 
regional gardening books and magazines for ideas.
Hardy perennials for sun
The following plants prefer full sun — at least 6 hours of direct sun each day. 
(In hot, sunny climates, some of these plants will thrive in part shade, too.) 
Most of these plants are hardy in zones 4 to 8; some are hardy even beyond 
that range.
 
✓ Aster: Wild asters grow as much as 6 feet tall, but cultivated varieties 
are much more compact, usually reaching about 18 inches tall. The 
plants grow unassumingly all summer, with attractive dark green foliage, 
then burst into bloom in late summer, with purple, pink, or white flow-
ers blanketing the whole plant. Combine asters with spring and summer 
bloomers for a three-season flower show.

133
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
 
 Most asters are hardy in zones 4 to 8 or 9 and thrive in areas with cool, 
moist summers. Plant in rich, moist soil in full sun. Pinch back shoots 
in spring and again in early summer to encourage bushiness and more 
flowers.
 
✓ Blanketflower (Gaillardia): These tough plants have a ruggedly hand-
some look with daisylike flowers in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, 
red, and burgundy in different patterns and combinations. Plants grow 2 
to 4 feet tall, and spread into a dense mound of blooms.
 
 Blanketflower is hardy in zones 3 to 9. Provide full sun, a fast-draining 
soil mix, and minimal water. When mature, plants can fill a container 
completely on their own — don’t combine them with other plants in the 
same container. Cluster pots of blanketflower with other low-growing 
perennials, separate pots of annuals, or tall grasses.
 
✓ Catmint (Nepeta): Vigorous, drought-tolerant, and hardy, catmints are 
ideal for containers. If space is limited, look for compact varieties like 
Little Trudy and Kit Kat that grow just 12 to 18 inches tall. Walker’s Low, 
the 2007 Perennial Plant of the Year, is larger, growing about 3 feet tall 
and wide. Most catmints, including these three varieties, have purple-
blue flowers but there are a few varieties with pink or white blooms. 
Catmints provide a flush of spiky blooms in spring, followed by repeat 
blooming all summer long. The shrubby, gray-green, fragrant foliage is 
attractive on its own and is ideal for hiding yellowing bulb foliage.
 
 Catmint is hardy in zones 4 to 8. Avoid overly wet soil and go lightly on 
the fertilizer, or you’ll get more foliage than blooms.
 
✓ Chrysanthemums: Familiar autumn flowers make chrysanthemums a 
garden favorite. So-called florist’s chrysanthemums are sold year-round 
at supermarkets and everywhere else — they’re typically used for 
instant color and subsequently thrown away. But look beyond the florist 
version to hundreds of other varieties, typically in shades of yellow, 
white, bronze, and red, in sizes ranging from 6 inches to 4 feet tall. 
Choose compact varieties for containers. Use taller, more upright types 
in the center of large container plantings. Combine with spring- and 
summer-flowering plants for a long season of color.
 
 Hardiness depends on variety. Provide full sun and regular water. Pinch 
back shoots in spring and again in early summer to encourage bushi-
ness. Pick fading flowers to prolong the blooms. Divide clumps every 
few years.
 
✓ Coreopsis: A container of blooming coreopsis can look like a pot of 
golden sunshine on your patio. Coreopsis grandiflora grows to 2 feet 
high and 3 feet wide with 2- to 3-inch bright yellow flowers. Coreopsis 
verticillata has smaller flowers and delicate foliage (the common name 
is threadleaf coreposis) and can stand on its own or complement any 
other plant.

134
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
 Coreopsis is hardy in zones 3 to 9. Provide full sun and a fast-draining 
soil mix. Keep blooms coming by cutting off fading flowers. If a plant has 
too many faded blooms to cut individually, shear back all the stems at 
once — expect your reward to be another round of flowers.
 
✓ Daylilies (Hemerocallis): Choose from numerous varieties with flow-
ers in yellow, orange, red, rust, burgundy, lilac, or purple — plus every 
imaginable color combination. Blooms rise regally above the leaves and 
face north, east, south, and west. Better yet, the daylily is an easy plant 
to grow almost everywhere. Varieties can be either deciduous (better for 
cold climates) or evergreen. The plants have long, strappy leaves that 
can grow 2 feet or taller. Dwarf daylilies — a nice choice for containers —
typically grow to only 6 or 10 inches tall.
 
 Daylilies are tough — they’re hardy in zones 3 to 9. Provide full sun with 
a bit of shade in very hot summer areas. Make sure that you keep their 
soil moist during bloom time. To prolong the flowering season, snap off 
spent flowers. The plants spread by underground rhizomes and need to 
be divided every few years — dividing is easy. If you have a friend who 
grows daylilies that you admire, ask for a division next time he or she 
divides plants.
 
✓ Delphinium: Thumb through a gardening magazine, and you’ll prob-
ably come across a picket-fence-enclosed garden planted with elegant, 
blue-flowering delphiniums — the classic, photogenic perennials. 
Delphiniums grow as tall as 6 feet with stalks of blue, lavender, white, 
pink, or yellow flowers, mostly in summer. More compact varieties — 
only 2 to 3 feet tall — work best in containers: Try to find Connecticut 
Yankee or Blue Fountains.
 
 Delphiniums grow in zones 3 to 7 (up to zone 9 where night tempera-
tures are cool). Plant in a rich, well-draining soil mix that’s not too 
acidic. Provide full sun and fertilize regularly. You may need to stake 
tall flowers.
 
✓ Echinacea: Once limited to purplish-pink flowers, the last few years 
have seen dozens of new echinacea varieties in a rainbow of flower 
colors, making the common name, purple coneflower, obsolete. These 
tough, drought-tolerant, adaptable plants bloom from midsummer into 
fall and are magnets for butterflies. Flower colors now include yellow, 
orange, salmon, deep rose-red, and even green. Look for the Big Sky 
series, as well as Green Envy, Coral Reef, Pink Poodle, and Tiki Torch.
 
 Echinacea is hardy in zones 3 to 8. Plant in full sun and well-drained soil, 
and go easy on the fertilizer. These prairie plants are adapted to lean 
conditions.
 
✓ Hardy geranium: Distinct from the large-flowered annual geranium 
(which is technically not a geranium at all but rather a pelargonium), 
hardy geraniums form low mounds of attractive, lobed leaves topped by 
delicate-looking, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of pink, blue, white, 
and purple. New varieties bloom all summer, including Rozanne, which 
was the 2008 Perennial Plant of the Year.

135
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
 
 Geraniums are hardy in zones 5 to 8. Plant in full sun and moist but well-
drained soil. Remove spent flowers to encourage reblooming.
 
✓ Lavender (Lavandula): English, French, and Spanish lavender are just 
a few types of this fragrant, favorite perennial. Shrublike plants grow 1 
to 3 feet tall with slender stalks of purplish flowers at the tips. Lavender 
is an outstanding container plant — mostly because portability lets you 
move your lavender plants where you can easily snatch a few leaves or 
flowers and appreciate the fragrance. Dwarf varieties — Compacta and 
others — work especially well in containers.
 
 Lavender is hardy in zones 5 to 8, but varies by species. Lavender is 
evergreen in mild climates and dies back in cold places. If you live in a 
cold climate, you can overwinter your lavender plants or start with new 
ones each year. Provide full sun and well-drained, sandy soil. Let the soil 
dry out between waterings. Lavender works well by itself in pots — the 
perennial’s preference for dry conditions makes it incompatible with 
most other plants. Cut plants way back (halfway or so) after the first 
bloom period.
 
✓ Penstemon, or beard tongue: Penstemons abound in all parts of 
the country. They’re shrublike plants, 2 to 5 feet tall, with spikes of 
tubular flowers in shades of white to coral, pink to red, and purple. 
Hummingbirds love the flowers. Best bets for containers are P. gloxinoi-
des hybrids, which sport bushy, compact growth. Combine them with 
lower-growing, broad-leafed perennials like lamb’s ear.
 
 Hardiness depends on variety. P. gloxinoides can grow year-round only 
in mild climates; elsewhere, treat it like an annual. Penstemon digitalis 
is hardy in zones 3 to 8; the variety Husker Red has unusual deep 
maroon foliage topped with white or pale pink flowers and was the 1996 
Perennial Plant of the Year.
 
 Provide full sun, unless you live in a very hot climate where plants may 
need a bit of shade in summer. Keep the soil mix very well-drained — 
too much water and soil that’s too rich can be deadly. For a strong 
second bloom, cut off all dead flower spikes.
 
✓ Pinks and carnations (Dianthus): This is a huge family, most of them 
carrying a familiar, wonderfully spicy fragrance — boutonniere-type car-
nations are the most familiar. For containers, consider compact types: 
cottage pinks, border carnations, and China pinks. Plants grow 8 to 16 
inches tall and are covered with a profusion of fragrant flowers in white 
to pink to magenta.
 
 Hardiness depends on variety; many are hardy in zones 3 or 4 to 9. Plant 
in light, well-drained soil. Provide part shade if summers are very hot in 
your area. Water well, but don’t overwater. Cut or pinch fading flowers 
to prolong blooming.
 
✓ Primroses: Their long, crinkly leaves and clusters of flowers in bright 
shades of blue, yellow, magenta, lavender, and white make them the per-
fect cottage garden accent. At least 500 different species and varieties 

136
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
exist, but you can’t go wrong with English primrose (Primula polyantha); 
it’s easy to grow, and is one of the first plants to bloom in spring. In the 
garden, primroses are usually planted at the edge of borders to draw 
attention to their beautiful flowers. Use that same principle in mixed 
flower pots — plant primroses at the perimeter of large pots or fill con-
tainers with single colors.
 
 English primroses are hardy in zones 3 to 7. Where winters are mild and 
summers long and hot (such as in California), primroses bloom from fall 
through early spring. Provide full sun in cool climates (or if grown to 
bloom in winter), part shade in warm climates. Make sure the soil mix is 
high in peat moss, and keep the soil moist.
 
✓ Rudbeckia: Commonly known as black-eyed Susans, rudbeckias, like 
echinaceas, are durable plants that thrive in a wide range of conditions. 
Most have yellow, daisylike flowers with dark centers. Rudbeckia fulgida 
Prairie Sun flowers have green centers. Goldsturm is a popular compact 
variety that grows up to 30 inches tall and is blanketed with blooms in 
late summer. It was the Perennial Plant of the Year in 1999.
 
 Most Rudbeckia fulgida varieties are hardy in zones 3 to 9. R. hirta vari-
eties, sometimes called gloriosa daisies, tend to be short-lived and are 
often grown as annuals. Plant rudbeckias in full sun and well-drained 
soil. Once established, they are relatively drought tolerant and need 
minimal supplemental fertilizer.
 
✓ Sage (Salvia): You may think of sage as a culinary herb, but the 900-
plus types of ornamental sages are plants of tremendous beauty and 
usefulness in the garden. Perennial salvias tend to be shrublike, ranging 
from 12 inches to 6 feet tall. Flowers grow on spikes, in shades of pink, 
red, white, coral, blue, and purple. Some salvias stand tall and upright; 
others cascade.
 
 Good choices for containers are mealy blue sage (S. farinacea), with 
foot-long spikes of blue flowers, and cherry sage (S. greggii), a low, 
bushy type. Both bloom from summer through fall and are hardy in 
zones 8 to 10. Salvia nemorosa is hardy in zones 4 to 8 and also blooms 
from summer to fall. One variety, May Night, has masses of deep blue 
flowers, and was the 1997 Perennial Plant of the Year.
 
 Salvias like full sun. Pinch frequently, starting when plants are young, to 
produce bushy growth. Cut plants way back in spring.
 
✓ Tall sedum: This succulent plant’s gray-green foliage provides a nice 
backdrop for spring- and summer-blooming plants. Come fall, it takes 
center stage with mounds of tiny flowers in shades of white, pink, red, 
and purple. Popular varieties include Autumn Joy and Brilliant. Black 
Jack has purple-black foliage and bright pink flowers.
 
 Sedum is hardy in zones 3 to 9. Plant in full sun; good drainage is a must. 
Combine with other drought-tolerant plants in containers, and water 
and fertilize sparingly.

137
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
 
✓ Yarrow (Achillea): Available in many varieties, yarrows produce feath-
ery leaves and tall stalks topped with flat clusters of flowers in various 
shades of yellow, pink, white, lavender, and red. Handsome foliage is 
green or gray-green, depending upon the variety. Yarrows’ roots spread 
easily — a single plant quickly fills a 4-inch pot. Use low-growing, creep-
ing varieties to fill blank spaces and spill over the edges of containers 
that include taller and bushier perennials. Use a taller variety (up to 3 
feet) as the centerpiece of a mixed pot.
 
 Yarrow is hardy in zones 3 to 8. Provide full sun and minimal water. 
Divide in spring when the clumps grow too large or too raggedy. Keep 
overwintering dormant plants on the dry side.
Hardy perennials for part shade and shade
The following plants thrive in part to full shade. Part shade includes areas that 
get morning sun or late afternoon sun, as well as areas under thin-canopied 
trees that provide dappled shade all day. In regions with hot summers, lean 
toward full shade locations; in regions with cool summers, go for part shade.
 
✓ Astilbe: Attractive mounds of glossy, fernlike foliage are topped with 
plumes of colorful flowers, making astilbes perfect for brightening up 
shady spots. Flower colors include pink, red, lavender, and white. The 
plant grows between 6 inches and 5 feet tall, depending on the variety.
 
 Astilbe is hardy in zones 4 to 8. It does best in regions with cool sum-
mers, and it likes rich, moist soil. It thrives in dappled shade and is 
generally pest-free. The plant flowers in late spring and early summer, so 
combine it with summer- and fall-blooming plants that prefer part shade 
and moist soil.
 
✓ Coral bells (Heuchera): Flower clusters on stems as tall as 3 feet feature 
drooping, bell-shaped blooms in shades of red, deep pink, coral, and 
white. But the real star is the foliage. Plant breeders have introduced 
dozens of new varieties with foliage in every combination of silver, green, 
gold, orange, chartreuse, red, and purple, many with variegated leaves. 
Look for names like Caramel, Ginger Ale, Plum Pudding, Lime Rickey, and 
Marmalade — these describe the foliage color. Coral bells combine beau-
tifully with annuals like pansies and other perennials such as hostas.
 
 Coral bells are hardy in zones 4 to 8. Provide full sun in cool climates 
and part shade where it’s hot. Plant groups of coral bells toward the rim 
of a large pot, next to taller and bushier plants that also require regular 
watering. Plants need to be divided every few years when they start to 
look woody.
 
✓ Hellebore: Valued for their glossy, evergreen foliage and nodding flow-
ers, hellebores have seen a resurgence in popularity now that breed-
ers have introduced varieties with larger, more colorful blooms. Use 

138
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
in planters set near windows and walkways so you can enjoy the early 
spring flowers. Helleborus x hybridus (a group of hybrids that includes 
many of the recent introductions) won the 2005 Perennial Plant of the 
Year award.
 
 Hellebores are hardy in zones 4 to 9. They require fertile, moist soil and 
part to full shade. In zones 6 and warmer, the plants retain their evergreen 
foliage all winter. They have no serious insect or disease problems.
 
✓ Foxglove (Digitalis): Usually thought of as a towering background 
plant, consider the compact varieties for containers: Foxy, Excelsior, 
and Gloxiniiflora are in the 2- to 3-foot range. Flowers from late spring to 
early fall are tubular, in shades of purple, white, and yellow, with striped 
and speckled throats.
 
 Foxglove is hardy in zones 4 to 8. Provide full sun or light shade and reg-
ular water. A single foxglove can fill a pot 18 inches in diameter. When 
the flower stalk fades, cut it at the base — you may get a second bloom. 
Most foxgloves are biennials and bloom only in their second growing 
season; however, one variety, Foxy, will bloom in its first growing season 
if planted early enough. A few foxglove species are perennial and will 
return year after year.
 
✓ Hosta, or plantain lily: This is a great plant for containers in the shade. 
Grow hosta for its big oval or heart-shaped leaves in deep green, char-
treuse, and many other shades. The plants form mounds from 6 inches 
to 5 feet tall, depending upon species.
 
 Hostas are hardy in zones 3 to 8. They prefer rich, moist soil and dap-
pled shade. They’re a favorite target for slugs and snails so keep an eye 
out for these pests; turn to Chapter 18 for techniques to deter them. 
Divide plants when they outgrow their containers.
Not-so-hardy perennials
This list includes plants that are hardy only to zones 8 or 9. They need care-
ful overwintering in all but the warmest parts of the country.
 
✓ Asparagus fern (Asparagus densiflorus syn Protasparagus densi-
florus): The overall effect of this plant is long, billowy clouds of green, 
sometimes studded with red berries. Arching stems 18 to 24 inches long 
have 1-inch long, flattened leaves that look a bit like needles. It’s easy 
and fast-growing in containers — a great choice for baskets, either alone 
or with shade-loving companions.
 
 Asparagus fern is hardy in zones 9 to 11. Provide full sun or part shade. 
Keep well-drained soil just barely moist. Overwinter in colder areas of 
the country. Trim out old dead branches, and repot overcrowded plants 
or divide old clumps. Asparagus fern is considered an invasive plant in 
parts of Florida.

139
 Chapter 11: Picking and Potting Perennials
 
✓ Blue marguerite (Felicia): Blue daisies with yellow centers are tiny but 
profuse. The plant’s main bloom season is summer, but in frost-free 
areas, you can expect flowers in winter and early spring — especially if 
you remove faded flowers. Plants grow up to 2 feet tall, and are shrubby 
and a bit sprawly. This is a tender plant that’s grown as an evergreen 
perennial in mild climates, but as an annual where winters are cold.
 
 Blue marguerite is hardy in zones 9 to 11. Provide full sun. Constantly 
pinch, prune, and groom flowers to contain vigorous growth and control 
its tendency to become a bit raggedy.
 
✓ Euryops: This is a landscape and container mainstay in mild climates 
because it’s long-blooming and very easy to grow. A shrubby daisy, it 
grows from 2 to 6 feet tall. It blooms heavily in late winter and early 
spring, then off and on throughout the rest of the year. Euryops pectina-
tus has gray-green leaves. E. p. Viridis has deep green leaves.
 
 Euryops is hardy to zones 9 to 11. Provide full sun. Allow the soil to dry 
out a bit between waterings. After the main bloom period, cut the plant 
back by about one-third.
 
✓ Ferns: Many ferns do well in containers in shady spots — as striking 
single plants or combined with shade-loving annuals in mixed plant-
ings. Most are not hardy and must be brought indoors in cold climates. 
Plant in a lightweight soil mix with plenty of organic matter. Keep the 
soil moist. Give foliage a misting whenever possible — especially when 
indoors. Here are a few among many great ferns for containers:
 
• Big statuesque ferns: Give these a good-sized container, up to 
16 inches wide, and a prominent spot in the landscape. When 
the roots fill the container, transplant the fern into the garden. 
Tasmanian tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica) produces arching 
fronds as long as 6 feet and is hardy in zones 9 to 11. Australian 
tree fern (Cyathea cooperi) grows even larger but is dramatic in a 
container while young. It’s hardy in zones 9 to 11.
 
• Small ferns: These combine nicely with other plants. Some are 
standouts in hanging baskets — alone or with other plants. All 
are on the tender side (zones 8 or 9 at best). Maidenhair ferns 
(Adiantum) are delicate, with wiry little stems and lacy fronds. 
Tuck maidenhair into a mixed hanging basket. Squirrel’s foot fern 
(Davallia) gracefully fills a hanging basket by itself, creeping and 
clinging to the moss lining the basket. Sword ferns and Boston 
ferns (Nephrolepis) are classics indoors and out with dark green, 
feathery fronds.
 
✓ Lily of the Nile (Agapanthus): This South African native has long, 
strappy leaves that grow from 1 to 3 feet long. In spring and summer, the 
plants send out tall clusters of flowers in shades of blue-purple or white. 
A single plant easily fills a 24-inch pot and doesn’t need to be divided for 
5 or 6 years. The dwarf variety, Peter Pan, grows only to 12 inches tall, 
an ideal size for smaller containers.

140
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
 Lily of the Nile is hardy in zones 8 to 11. Provide full sun or part shade. 
Keep the soil moist, but not wet. Divide when roots fill up the container.
 
✓ Marguerite (Chrysanthemum frutescens): If you’re like many people, 
this may be the first perennial that you grow in a container — it’s very 
easy, fast-growing, long-blooming, and abundant. White, yellow, cream, 
or pink daisies bloom continuously over the summer. Shrubby plants 
grow into a dense mass 4 feet tall.
 
 Marguerite is hardy in zones 8 or 9 to 10 and can be grown as a summer 
annual everywhere else. Provide full sun. To control size and force more 
blooms, pinch the tips right from the beginning. In mild climates, cut 
back plants by at least one-fourth in early spring.
 
✓ New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax): Swordlike leaves form dramatic 
fans ranging in size from 18 inches to 6 feet or more. Leaves are bronze, 
red, purple, or green, often striped with another color. Plant this one 
alone in a large pot (18 inches or wider), or combine it with mounding 
perennials and annuals.
 
 New Zealand flax is hardy in zones 8 or 9 to 10. Provide full sun or part 
shade. Let the soil dry out between waterings. This is not a fussy plant.
 
✓ Peruvian lily (Alstroemeria): Although not a true lily, it’s just as beauti-
ful and graceful. Intense hybridization has created a myriad of lilylike 
multicolored flowers in shades of white with pink, pink with white and 
yellow, lilac and purple, orange-yellow, and many more color combina-
tions. Leafy stems range from 2 to 5 feet tall.
 
 Alstroemeria is hardy in zones 8 to 10. In mild-winter areas, Peruvian 
lilies bloom much of the year. In colder-winter areas, bloom season may 
be May through summer. Provide full sun or part shade, depending 
upon variety, a high-quality soil mix, and moderate amounts of water. 
Roots are rather brittle; when you plant, set the root cluster fairly deep, 
with only the top showing. Roots prefer not to be disturbed, so plant in 
a container with plenty of room to grow.
 
✓ Purple fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum Rubrum): Grasses are 
strikingly beautiful in pots. This is one of the more striking, forming 
graceful mounds of purplish-brown leaves up to 2 or even 4 feet tall. In 
summer, fuzzy pink or purplish flower spikes form. If you prefer to con-
trol the spread of grasses throughout your garden, cut off seed heads 
before they mature.
 
 Purple fountain grass is hardy in zones 8 to 11, but you can grow foun-
tain grass as an annual in colder climates. Provide full sun and almost 
any soil mix. Combine with other perennials that require little water.

Sprucing Up Your Space with 
Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
In This Chapter
▶ Using shrubs and trees creatively in your landscape
▶ Caring for your rich array
▶ Perusing the many planting possibilities
Y
ou’re most likely to appreciate growing shrubs, trees, and vines in con-
tainers if you have little or no ground space to grow them. These gener-
ously sized container plants can instantly transform a small, open space into 
an inviting, landscaped garden.
But any garden — old or new, large or small — can benefit from a handsome 
shrub or tree in a container. A container has a way of highlighting a plant that 
is otherwise pretty mundane. Mugho pine in a rugged terra-cotta pot evokes 
the sturdy dignity of the forest, while the same plant in the ground looks kind 
of like a green blob.
In this chapter, we lay out some benefits of growing trees and shrubs in con-
tainers, give you some reminders about planting and caring for them, and 
then give you all sorts of suggestions for what to plant.
 
Reading a plant’s description is one thing; seeing what a plant looks like is 
another thing. The best way to check out plants is in person: Visit your local 
public garden or arboretum, as well as nurseries and garden centers, to see 
what grows well in your region. Online nursery catalogs often have good 
photos, too, but you’ll need to read plant descriptions carefully to find out 
what will thrive in your climate, as well as in the confines of a container.

142
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Seeing What Shrubs and 
Trees Can Do for You
Shrubs, trees, and vines can perform big-time in containers. Here are just a 
few things they can do for you:
 
✓ Create a sense of scale in a garden: They can make a small terrace or 
balcony seem like a garden.
 
✓ Produce seasonal displays: They can provide spring blossoms, fall 
color, or winter berries. Woody plants with unusual branch structure or 
attractive bark provide year-round interest.
 
✓ Look handsome or dramatic in their own right: This is especially so if 
you prune them to emphasize their structure. When we refer to a speci-
men plant or accent, that’s what we’re talking about — a container plant 
that’s attractive enough to stand alone and be admired.
 
✓ Work hard in a landscape: They can create a privacy screen, a divider, 
or shade. They can provide a dependable green background for seasonal 
container plants like annuals and bulbs.
 
✓ Let you experiment: Try plants that are dicey in your area because of 
cold weather or bad soil. For example, try growing hibiscus outdoors 
during the summer and indoors in the winter.
 
✓ Attract wildlife: Birds, especially, appreciate trees and shrubs for shel-
ter. You’ll probably get more birds at your feeder if you have a tree or 
shrub nearby.
Planting and Caring for Shrubs 
and Trees: The Basics
Permanent plants, including trees and shrubs, generally need less care than 
annuals or perennials, but they’re not maintenance-free. You may not feel 
that bummed if you lose a pot of pansies that you forget to water, but it’s a 
different matter when the casualty is a 7-year-old wisteria you just coaxed 
into bloom for the first time.
We describe special care requirements for different shrubs and trees in the 
later plant descriptions. Here are a few reminders that apply to most woody 
plants:

143
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
 
✓ Planting: The planting schedules for shrubs and trees in containers 
are the same as those for their in-ground counterparts. Generally, you 
plant in spring in cold climates, and in spring or fall in mild areas. The 
plants discussed here typically are available in gallon (or larger) cans, 
bare-root, or balled and burlapped. For more details about planting, see 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Soil: Use soil mixes described in Chapter 4 or the special mixes we rec-
ommend for specific plants in the list that follows.
 
✓ Container: Pay special attention to container selection, because a per-
manent plant can live in the same container for a number of years. The 
basic rule applies: Start with a container that’s 2 or 3 inches wider and 
deeper than the one in which the plant was grown. (Need some con-
tainer ideas? Flip to Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Feeding: Permanent plants don’t need the constant feeding that annuals 
do, but plan to feed them at least several times during the growing season. 
See Chapter 16 for details on fertilizing. For best results, incorporate com-
post and/or a slow-release fertilizer into the soil mix at planting time.
 
✓ Watering: No way around it, you have to water. Consider a drip irriga-
tion system if you have a lot of containers. (Head to Chapter 15 for the 
specifics on watering.)
 
✓ Pruning: However flip it may seem, if you grow a lot of different shrubs 
and trees, the best advice may be to buy a pruning book. Pruning is a 
big subject, and you need to prune your container plants just as you do 
garden plants. Our plant descriptions later in this chapter give you some 
tips, and you can also check with the nursery where you buy your plants.
 
✓ Repotting: If you keep plants in the same containers for a few years, you 
can count on a round of repotting. Look for clues that it’s time to replace 
your plant’s happy home: when roots fill the pot or start to show at soil 
level, or the plant always seems dry. See the section on repotting in 
Chapter 17.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Unfortunately, container shrubs and trees are 
susceptible to the same problems as their cousins in the ground. See 
Chapter 18 for some pointers.
Identifying Candidates for Containers
Shrubs and trees are lumped together because so many of them overlap in size 
and function, especially when grown in containers. To help you filter through 
the selections, we split them into two unscientific but useful categories:

144
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Hardy: Generally rated hardy to zones 5, 6, or 7, these plants will grow 
in most regions of the country and may or may not need winter protec-
tion, depending upon your winter climate.
 
 If you’re not sure of your hardiness zone, check out the USDA’s 
Hardiness Zone Map in Chapter 2, or ask at your local nursery.
 
✓ Not-so-hardy: Rated to zones 8, 9, or 10, these plants will grow outdoors 
in summer everywhere but need careful winter protection in all but the 
mildest climates.
Within each of the two preceding categories, you’ll see two subcategories: 
deciduous (plants that drop leaves in the dormant season) and evergreen.
Hardy trees and shrubs
Below is a sampling from among the many hardy trees and shrubs suitable for 
container growing. Remember that the hardiness zones given are for plants 
growing in the ground, and that plants growing in containers may need protec-
tion from extreme cold. (Review Chapter 10 for overwintering techniques.)
Deciduous
These plants drop their leaves in fall, go dormant in the winter, and begin 
growing again in spring.
 
✓ Cotoneaster: Among the many kinds of cotoneaster, several are con-
tainer standouts. Creeping cotoneaster (C. adpressus) and bearberry 
(C. dammeri) can spill from pots and hanging baskets, producing bright 
berries. They’re small (less than a foot tall) and easy to grow. Provide 
full sun. Most are hardy in zones 6 to 9.
 
✓ Crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica): Take your pick — crape myrtle 
can serve as a handsome small tree or a hanging basket trailer. Not 
many plants can fill both these roles. Plant full-size varieties in large con-
tainers to grow as single-trunk or multitrunk trees, 8 or 10 feet tall. The 
bark develops an interesting combination of scaliness and smoothness, 
and summer flowers come in rich pinks, reds, and purples. A favorite 
tree for shopping centers and business parks, crape myrtle is always 
handsome. Miniature varieties really can go into hanging baskets: They 
bloom nicely and have trailing branches.
 
 Provide full sun. Watch for mildew, which probably means your climate 
is too cool. Crape myrtle is hardy in zones 7 to 9.
 
✓ Flowering cherry, crabapple, or plum trees: These trees aren’t for 
beginners, but their beautiful spring blossoms may tempt you to give 
growing them a try. Some produce fruit, and some don’t. Our advice in a 
nutshell: Get a big container (like a half barrel), choose small varieties, 

145
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
and prune after spring bloom to keep the trees small. Hardiness varies. 
Flip to Chapter 13 for information on growing other fruit trees.
 
✓ Harry Lauder’s walking stick (Corylus avellana Contorta): This plant 
is a genuine conversation piece in a container (you may have suspected 
as much from the name). Its contorted branches and shiny brown bark 
are shown off best when the plant is leafless in winter. In a container, 
expect a height of about 4 to 6 feet. Put it where you can enjoy its fasci-
nating shape and bark up close.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. Make sure the soil mix drains quickly. In 
spring, prune branches that interfere with the shape you want. Harry 
Lauder’s walking stick is hardy in zones 4 to 9.
 
✓ Hydrangea: Huge flowers and bold foliage make Hydrangea macrophylla 
a summer show-off in 18-inch or bigger containers. Flowers in clusters 
a foot or more wide come in blue, pink, red, or white. Plants grow 4 feet 
tall and larger.
 
 Hydrangea macrophylla is hardy in zones 6 to 9 (some other hydrangea 
species are hardier). Overwinter plants in cold climates, or look for new 
varieties, like Endless Summer, that bloom reliably and repeatedly in 
cold climates. Provide sun or part shade, and protect plants from hot 
summer sun. Use a soil mix with plenty of organic matter. Hydrangeas 
are water hogs, but they’re good about drooping and telling you when 
they need water.
 
 Apply aluminum sulfate to the soil before the bloom season to make 
pink-flowering varieties turn blue.
 
✓ Japanese maple (Acer palmatum): You may want to put Japanese 
maples at the top of your container plantings list (provided you live in 
an appropriate climate). Why? Japanese maple is just plain beautiful — 
in both form and leaf color, whether spring green or fall red. Some say 
its bare branches in winter are so handsome that they don’t need leaves 
to look great. And they’re the right scale for patio container plants. A 
typical Japanese maple can grow 15 feet or more in the ground, but it’s 
much shorter in a container. Compact varieties work best in contain-
ers: Dissectum and Crimson Queen are just two. Look for varieties with 
bright fall colors or even colorful bark (Sango Kaku has coral bark).
 
 Japanese maples are hardy in zones 5 to 9. They don’t do well in hot, 
dry climates. Provide afternoon shade in most climates. Plant in a soil 
mix containing lots of organic matter, and keep the soil most (Japanese 
maples are sensitive to alkaline soil and too little water, causing the 
leaves to turn brown at the tips). Shelter from dry winds. In spring, 
prune lightly to remove dead wood or to shape growth.
 
 Japanese maple grows fairly quickly: Plan to repot it in progressively 
larger containers or to root-prune frequently to keep it in the same con-
tainer. Start with a gallon-size plant in a 12-inch pot; put a 5-gallon-size in 
a 16-inch pot or tub.

146
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Rose: There are thousands of roses, and theoretically you can grow all 
of them in containers. But some varieties are much better suited to con-
tainer life than others. If you want to grow a particular rose just because 
you like the flower (most likely, it’s a hybrid tea type — that’s what flo-
rists sell), feel free, but be aware that the plant may not produce many 
flowers, it may not look that great, and it may quickly outgrow its con-
tainer. We suggest the smaller, more compact roses that are categorized 
as miniatures, polyanthas, floribundas, and some shrub roses. They 
grow from less than 2 to 5 feet, and their bloom season is long (from 
spring through early fall) and prolific (especially for floribundas and 
polyanthas). Here are our favorites for containers:
 
• Betty Prior: Pink floribunda
 
• Bonica: Pink shrub
 
• Brass Band: Apricot-yellow floribunda
 
• Carefree Delight: Pink shrub
 
• Carefree Wonder: Pink and white shrub
 
• China Doll: Pink polyantha
 
• Europeana: Red floribunda
 
• The Fairy: Pink polyantha
 
• Flower Carpet: Several colors, shrub
 
• Iceberg: White floribunda
 
• Knockout: A series of long-blooming, disease-resistant varieties
 
• Margaret Merrill: White floribunda
 
• Margo Koster: Coral floribunda
 
• Regensberg: White and pink floribunda
 
• Sarabande: Orange-red floribunda
 
• Sun Flare: Yellow floribunda
 
• Watermelon Ice: Pink shrub
 
 Provide full sun and typical soil mix (nothing special). Give miniatures 
and other small roses at least a 12-inch-diameter container. For larger 
varieties, use a 14-inch pot or a half barrel (especially if you combine a 
rose with annuals or perennials). Select containers that are at least 16 
inches deep to provide room for vigorous root growth. Make sure the 
soil never dries out.
 
 Rose hardiness depends on variety. The best advice we can give you is 
to check locally for climate adaptability. Much is involved in growing 
first-rate roses, and some people take extreme measures to create spe-
cial conditions for roses. That’s why whole books have been written on 

147
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
the subject. We recommend Roses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Lance 
Walheim and the editors of the National Gardening Association (Wiley) for 
more advice on pruning, feeding, pest control, and choosing varieties.
Evergreen
These hardy trees and shrubs hang onto their foliage year-round, making 
them good candidates for background plantings, for privacy screens, or to 
shield an unsightly view. Some make striking specimen plants — worth show-
ing off individually — especially as they grow older and are pruned to expose 
more of the trunks and branches.
 
Prune evergreens — especially needle-bearing types — with care. Some take 
well to shearing; others don’t, leaving you with lots of dead stubs.
 
✓ Aucuba: Aucuba japonica is grown for its bright red berries in fall and 
big, shiny leaves (dark green or splotched with yellow variegation). 
Aucuba also gets big enough — up to 6 feet tall — to create a privacy 
screen or a backdrop for smaller container plants. Oh, one more thing: 
Aucuba does well in shady spots where few other plants can thrive.
 
 Provide part or full shade and ordinary soil mix. Soil can stay on the dry 
side. Prune back tips of new growth to encourage bushiness. Aucuba is 
hardy in zones 7 to 10.
 
✓ Azaleas and rhododendrons: Consider yourself lucky if you live in an 
area where you can grow these magnificent, spring-flowering shrubs — 
happily, containers can improve your odds. Rhododendrons and azaleas 
are closely related, and literally thousands of varieties exist: Check with 
local nurseries for varieties that do well in your area. Following are a 
couple recommendations:
 
• Evergreen azaleas: Usually grown as small shrubs, these are the 
most reliable for containers. Read plant tags carefully because 
some are hardy only to zones 8 or 9. Also, keep in mind that some 
types of azaleas are deciduous — another reason to read the tags 
carefully! Plant gallon-size azaleas in 14-inch pots.
 
• Rhododendrons: Try to find small, compact types, which grow 4 
to 6 feet tall in containers. Ironclads do well in containers and are 
hardier than most (to zone 5). Rhododendrons are usually sold in 
larger sizes than azaleas, and eventually they require a big con-
tainer, usually a redwood box 16 to 24 inches in diameter.
 
 Rhododendrons and azaleas share some rather demanding needs — an 
acid-type soil mix and just the right amount of sunlight. Containers allow 
you to move the plants around and experiment a bit. These plants are 
difficult to grow in hot, dry climates, especially where water is alkaline. 
In cool, overcast climates, grow the plants in full or nearly full sun. 
Elsewhere, plant them in part shade.

148
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
 Make sure the soil mix is on the acidic side and fast draining (see 
Chapter 4): Nurseries sell mixes specifically for rhododendrons and aza-
leas. Don’t plant too deep — level the top of the root ball with the top 
of the soil mix or even a fraction of an inch higher. Start fertilizing when 
the blooming season ends: Use an acid-type food (choose one labeled 
for rhododendrons and azaleas) at the frequency recommended on the 
label or monthly through the growing season. After bloom, cut off dead 
flowers right away. Watch for brown leaf tips that indicate salt burn. 
Flush salts every few months with a couple of extra heavy waterings. 
Never let the soil dry out.
 
 Rhododendrons and azaleas need a lot of pampering, but you’ll be 
rewarded with gorgeous blooms (and lots of compliments!). Move them 
out of the way when not in bloom, and put them in your most prominent 
spot when they’re flowering.
 
✓ Boxwood: The first word in formality, boxwood is a shiny, dark green 
evergreen that lends itself to shearing in geometric shapes: globes, rect-
angles, and so on. Grow in urns, glazed pots, or other formal containers. 
Picture boxwood sheared into round balls, growing in matching contain-
ers, flanking a front entry. Provide full sun or part shade. Roots are shal-
low. Don’t let soil dry out. Boxwood is hardy in zones 6 to 8.
 
✓ Camellia: Here’s a wonderful choice for containers if you live in a favor-
able climate, primarily the southern and western United States. Grow 
camellias for their glossy, evergreen leaves and their beautiful flowers — 
white, pink, and red — in late winter and early spring. Plants are hand-
some year-round, and in containers can grow slowly to 5 or 6 — or even 
12 — feet.
 
 Thousands of varieties exist — check out nurseries and choose plants 
with appealing flowers. Camellia japonica, the most familiar species, 
makes a fine container plant. Also consider C. reticulata varieties with 
spectacular flowers on rangy plants. C. sasanqua varieties can spill from 
containers or stand upright, and the flowers come at a most welcome 
time — early fall.
 
 Pay special attention to planting and care. Camellias aren’t fussy, but 
they do need special conditions for best growth. Put gallon-size plants 
in 12-inch tubs and larger plants in 16-inch containers. Plant on the high 
side, with the top of the root ball above soil level. Provide part shade 
or full sun in cool climates, and move plants to a protected spot during 
cold weather in marginal climates. Use a soil mix that’s fast-draining and 
acidic — if you want, just choose a mix labeled for camellias and other 
acid-loving plants — and make sure the soil is constantly moist. Pick 
up dead flowers to stop spread of petal blight. Start feeding after bloom 
with camellia or acid food.
 
 Camellias are hardy in zones 7 to 9; some new varieties are hardy in 
zone 6.

149
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
 
✓ Conifers: Conifers are some of the most beautiful and striking plants 
for growing in containers, and they’re available in a remarkable array of 
colors, forms, and sizes. Foliage may be green, blue-green, gray-green, 
chartreuse, gold, or silvery blue, depending on the species and variety. 
Some conifers have sharp, spiky needles; the needles on others are soft 
and draping. Size and shape vary widely, too. Some grow in tall columns; 
others are low and spreading. A grouping of different conifers in similar 
pots makes an elegant display. Look for dwarf or small-statured varieties 
and check hardiness ratings.
 
 Some needle-bearing conifers, like spruces and firs, can make nice living 
Christmas trees — indoors for a few weeks and outdoors the rest of the 
year.
 
✓ Daphne (Daphne burkwoodii): This evergreen shrub is a garden 
workhorse, easy to grow and reliable. Growing 3- or 4-feet tall, it pro-
duces sweet flowers in spring. Place containers where you can enjoy 
the fragrance — near a door or walk.
 
 Provide part shade in most climates, full sun in cool areas. Take care not 
to disturb roots when planting. This plant can stay in the same container 
for a long time without repotting. Daphne is hardy in zones 5 to 8.
 
✓ English laurel (Prunus laurocerasus): Often used in hedges, English 
laurel in a container makes a dense, glossy evergreen screen or back-
drop for shady spots. Plants typically grow up to 6 feet tall, but compact 
types, such as Zabeliana, stay lower.
 
 Provide sun or shade. This plant is easy to grow. Shape by pruning 
rather than shearing. Move to a protected spot in cold areas. English 
laurel is hardy in zones 6 or 7 to 9.
 
✓ Heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica): Not a real bamboo, nandina 
is a graceful, erect-growing evergreen shrub that performs solidly in all 
seasons. It’s easy to grow in a container. Clusters of small, white flowers 
bloom in spring and summer; red berries and crimson foliage follow in 
fall and winter. Expect mature plants to grow 5 feet tall or more in a con-
tainer. Dwarfs are much more compact (Nana is only about a foot tall, 
and lacks the grace of the taller types).
 
 Provide sun or part shade. This plant can live in the same container for 
several years without repotting. In cold climates, you can move heav-
enly bamboo indoors for the winter. It’s hardy in zones 6 or 7 to 9.
 
✓ Holly: Picture a pair of glossy, spiny-leafed hollies covered with red ber-
ries in matching containers flanking your front door for the Christmas 
holidays. How possible is it? Well, hollies can grow well in containers — if 
they’re suited to your climate, you satisfy their rather demanding needs, 
and have enough patience to grow the plants for at least several years. 
Also, for berry development, you have to grow both a male and female 
plant (they’re sold labeled by sex). If you want two berry-bearing (female) 
plants by your front door, you’ll need a third male plant nearby.

 English holly (Ilex aquifolium) is the traditional type; it grows to 6 to 
10 feet in a large container. Chinese holly (I. cornuta) is easier to grow, 
especially in hot climates. Yaupon holly is native to the southeast United 
States and is the most reliable choice for that region.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade in hot climates. The soil mix must be high 
in organic matter and drain quickly. Shear young plants to encourage 
bushiness, and prune as needed to keep the spiny leaves from scratch-
ing passersby. Hardiness varies. In the United States, English holly is 
really reliable only in the Pacific Northwest and northern California.
 
✓ India hawthorn (Rhaphiolepis): This dependable, versatile landscape 
plant also is — surprise — a dependable, versatile container plant. It 
provides glossy leaves year-round and bright pink flowers in spring. 
Plants form rounded mounds up to 4 feet tall. Nurseries sell India haw-
thorn trained as small trees (standards) with globelike tops on 3- or 
4-foot trunks.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. Don’t worry about providing any special 
care. Plant in a 12-inch pot, and keep plants small and bushy by regular 
pinching starting when they’re young. India hawthorn is hardy in zones 
7 or 8 to 10.
 
✓ Lily of the valley shrub (Pieris japonica): This shrub is so understated 
that you may not guess that it’s a rhododendron relative. Lily of the 
valley shrubs always look nice. Their foliage is handsome year-round, 
tinged with red in spring. Little bell-shaped, white flowers are charming 
in spring. Expect a height of 8 feet in the ground, lower in a container.
 
 Provide part shade or full sun in cool, overcast climates. Use an acid 
soil mix suggested for azaleas and rhododendrons. Lilly of the valley is 
hardy in zones 6 to 8.
Not-so-hardy trees and shrubs
The plants in this list are less hardy than the ones above; most are hardy 
only to zones 7 or 8. They’re good options for warm climates and for garden-
ers in cold-winter climates that are willing to provide winter protection.
Deciduous
These plants drop their leaves, leaving the branches bare for anywhere 
from a few weeks to a few months depending on the species and locale, then 
resprout.
 
✓ Chinese paperbush (Edgeworthia chrysantha): This multistemmed 
shrub or small tree grows to a height of about 6 feet with attractive bark 
and oblong, bluish green leaves. In early winter, it drops its leaves to 

151
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
reveal silvery flower buds. A month or two later, the fragrant, tubular 
flowers begin opening, before the new leaves emerge. Chinese paper-
bush is hardy in zones 7 or 8 to 10.
 
✓ Fuchsia: If you’re climate-blessed, you can grow fuchsias as permanent 
plants. They’re terrific in baskets (trailing types) or pots (upright types 
up to 6 feet tall). Their flowers are spectacular: intricately flared and 
dangling, richly colored in white, pink, purple, and many other colors.
 
 Fuchsias are demanding, but worth the effort. Provide part shade. Use 
containers from 6 to 12 inches in diameter. Make sure the soil mix is 
high in organic matter and drains quickly. Keep the soil moist, and 
increase humidity in dry climates by misting daily. Start pinching new 
growth early in spring. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing 
season. Keep an eye out for mites.
 
 Fuchsias are hardy to zone 9 or 10 to 11 — frost will do them in. Grow 
them as annuals in cold climates.
 
✓ Lantana: This shrubby plant’s bright flower colors suggest sunny, tropi-
cal places — clusters of flowers bloom over a long season in white, gold, 
pink, orange, red, and white. Use trailing lantana (L. montevidensis) in 
hanging baskets for sunny, dry spots; expect it to sprawl gracefully over 
the sides of the basket. Common lantana (L. camara) is good in a big 
container, growing to 4 feet tall and spreading about as wide. It’s also 
available trained as a small tree (standard).
 
 Provide full sun. Keep the soil on the dry side. Prune off dead wood in 
spring. Lantana is hardy in zones 7 or 8 to 11.
Evergreen
These plants stay green year-round, making them ideal for adding winter 
interest in warm climates. In regions with cold winters, be prepared to pro-
tect them during the winter.
 
✓ Fatsia, or Japanese aralia (Fatsia japonica): This plant’s bold leaves 
add drama to shady spots. An evergreen shrub, it can grow to 6 feet tall 
or more, making it suitable for use as a specimen plant in an entry or 
dark corner. This is a favorite plant to bring indoors for the winter; it 
can also serve as a permanent houseplant.
 
 Provide part shade or full shade. Plant in a large container. Don’t let 
soil dry out. And don’t be afraid to prune back stems, which otherwise 
become leggy. Fatsia is hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Gardenia: A prima donna — but at least you stand a better chance of 
giving gardenia the conditions it needs when you plant it in a container. 
No other plant can match the romance of its legendary fragrance. While 
they’re alive, the plants are handsome too, with glossy, deep green 
leaves. Mystery (what a perfect name for a plant you may never figure 
out!) grows 4 or 5 feet tall. Veitchii is a compact 3 feet.

152
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
 Provide part shade in hot climates and full sun in cool places. Use a 
fast-draining, acid-type soil mix. Plant so that the top of the root ball is 
just above soil level. Make sure the soil stays moist. Fertilize frequently 
with acid food (azalea fertilizer) during the growing season. Good luck! 
Gardenia is hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Hawaiian hibiscus: The symbol of Hawaii, of course this shrub is tender. 
But cold-climate gardeners are tempted every year by nursery plants 
sporting huge (up to 6-inch) blossoms in bright reds, yellows, and other 
vivid shades. The solution is easy: Transplant hibiscus into a 12-inch or 
so container, put it in a warm spot, grow it for the summer, and then get 
rid of it — in other words, treat it like a petunia or other annual. You can 
also bring it indoors for the winter in cold regions, but you’ll probably 
already have gotten your money’s worth with summer blooms. In con-
tainers, plants grow quickly to as tall as 6 feet; leaves are bright green 
and glossy.
 
 Provide full sun (reflected light, too, if you have it). Make sure the soil 
stays damp. Feed at least once a month during warm weather. Pinch 
young shoots for bushy growth. Hawaiian hibiscus is hardy to zones 9 or 
10 in protected spots.
 
✓ Myrtle: Shear these little evergreens into topiaries or other formal 
shapes. For containers, look for dwarf myrtle varieties like Compacta 
and Microphylla, which reach 2 or 3 feet tall.
 
 Provide full sun, and make sure the soil stays moist. Myrtle is hardy in 
zones 8 to 11.
 
✓ Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla): You may not know it 
by name, but this is a popular and highly recognizable tree for contain-
ers. Its unusual growth habit displays feathery foliage in horizontal tiers. 
Slender and tall, it grows up to 10 or 12 feet. Another outstanding qual-
ity: Norfolk Island pine can live indoors for the winter (it has to in cold 
climates) — or even all the time. Use it as a living Christmas tree.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. No special care is necessary. This is not 
a true pine — it comes from the South Pacific. Norfolk pine is hardy to 
zone 9.
 
✓ Oleander: Resiliant and easy to grow, oleander is another one of those 
basic landscape plants that takes on a whole new personality in a con-
tainer. Use it as a specimen in a big pot, or create a privacy screen with 
a row of plants in containers. Oleander can also be trained as a small 
tree. Its summer flowers are white, pink, red, or yellow. Plants grow to 6 
feet or more. Best choices for containers are dwarf varieties (“Petite” in 
the name is a good clue).

153
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
 
 Provide full sun. You can keep soil on the dry side, but oleander can also 
take frequent watering. Give the plant a big enough container: at least 14 
inches for best growth. Prune hard in spring to control size. Oleander is 
hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
 All parts of the oleander are poisonous.
 
✓ Pineapple guava (Feijoa): This subtropical can produce edible green 
fruit while in a container, and it makes a handsome specimen plant for 
a patio or deck. Expect it to grow 5 or 6 feet tall; pruning keeps it more 
compact.
 
 Provide full sun. A large container (14 inches and up) encourages the 
best growth. Don’t let the soil dry out. Pineapple guava is hardy in zones 
8 to 10.
 
✓ Pittosporum: Several kinds of pittosporum that are used as evergreen 
landscape plants also excel in containers. Not particularly showy, 
they’re just solid-citizen types, with dense, shiny foliage that can be 
sheared into formal shapes. Use several to create a portable hedge or 
privacy screen. P. tobira Wheeler’s Dwarf is very compact; Variegata has 
cream and light green foliage that lights up in shade. Cape pittosporum 
(P. viridiflorum) can make a multitrunk small tree in a large container.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. No special care is needed. Pittosporum is 
hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Podocarpus: Dependable and evergreen, podocarpus grows slowly and 
can live in a container for a long time. It’s useful where you want some-
thing tall and slender — to block a view or accent a corner. Podocarpus 
lends itself to growing along an eave, or you can train it to grow flat 
against a support like a wall. Fern pine (P. gracilior) has thin, gray-green 
leaves. Yew pine (P. macrophyllus) has broader, dark green leaves. 
Neither is a true pine.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. Podocarpus is hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Pomegranate: An unlikely choice for a container, pomegranate has 
much to offer. The orange-red flowers are pretty, and the fruit is fun (and 
tasty). The full-sized variety can turn into a rambunctious handful (that 
means a tangled, oversized mess) in a container. Try Nana, a more com-
pact type growing to 3 feet. Its flowers are abundant, but the fruit is small 
and not worth eating. Deciduous foliage turns a nice yellow in the fall.
 
 Pomegranate thrives in hot climates. Provide full sun, and keep the soil 
on the dry side. Prune in spring by cutting back long shoots and remov-
ing tangled branches. Pomegranate is hardy in zones 8 to 11.
 
✓ Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo): This can make a handsome minia-
ture tree or shrub in a container. It has attractive bark, small white flow-
ers, and beautiful red berries (the “strawberry” in the name). Compact 
varieties like Compacta work best in containers: Expect a maximum 
height of 5 or 6 feet.

154
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. The strawberry tree is a favorite West 
Coast landscape plant. It can stay in a 12-inch container for a number of 
years. It’s hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Sweet bay (Laurus nobilis): A cook’s dream is to have sweet bay in a 
container right outside the back door. This evergreen is the source of 
bay leaves used in the kitchen and in wreaths for the home and head 
(in ancient Greece). This plant grows to 6 feet tall but can be sheared to 
stay smaller and to create more formal shapes like cones and globes.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. The container needs to be 12 to 14 inches 
or larger. In cold climates, bring sweet bay indoors for the winter. It’s 
hardy in zones 8 to 10.
 
✓ Sweet olive (Osmanthus fragrans): This nondescript evergreen shrub 
shows the value of container planting: Keep it in the background most 
of the year and then move it near the front porch in fall when its barely 
noticeable flowers produce a truly delicious fragrance. This plant gener-
ally grows 5 or 6 feet tall in containers.
 
 Provide full sun or part shade. No special care is needed. Prune to shape 
growth. Sweet olive is hardy in zones 8 or 9 to 10.
Selecting Six Vines for Containers
Growing vines on trellises and other supports is a good way to add height to 
container plantings. A vine-covered arbor makes a lovely garden entryway, 
and vines growing on lattice can shield a porch from hot summer sun — and 
from your neighbors. Many perennial vines get too big too quickly to make 
them practical for containers; below we list a few that are more manageable.
 
If you want to grow climbing vines that you know will need winter protection, 
you have a few options for overwintering:
 
✓ You can place the trellis right in the pot, so you can move the whole 
thing into a sheltered spot.
 
✓ Depending on the climate and type of plant, you may be able to leave the 
plant where it is and insulate the pot with a thick layer of straw or other 
mulch.
 
✓ You can cut the plant off the trellis at the end of the growing season 
and move the pot to its sheltered spot. Most vines will resume vigorous 
growth in spring.
For colorful blooms or year-round greenery, the following vines are well 
worth a try.

155

Bougainvillea
The sight of bougainvillea sprawling along a lush roadside in Hawaii or 
engulfing a building in Puerto Vallarta hardly suggests that the plant can 
thrive in a container. Actually, bougainvillea’s a great choice — if you select 
the right variety and put it in the right place. It seems perfectly at home in 
a terra-cotta pot near a swimming pool. The papery flowers have a tropical 
vividness in shades of red, orange, purple, white, and other colors. Look for 
dwarf varieties (La Jolla is a good one) for containers — they spill nicely over 
the sides. Trailing types (Crimson Jewel) are best for hanging baskets. Tall 
varieties can be tied up as a vine.
Provide full sun except in the hottest climates. Keep the soil on the dry side; 
drainage must be perfect. When planting, take pains not to disturb the roots 
at all. In spring, prune off any cold-damaged wood or crossing branches. 
During the growing season, prune off branches growing where you don’t want 
them to go.
Bougainvillea is hardy in zones 9 to 11 (some varieties are hardier than 
others). Yes, bougainvillea is tender and can be grown outdoors in only the 
mildest climates. But in cold places, you can grow it as a summer-only con-
tainer plant, and bring it indoors for the winter; give it your sunniest spot 
near a window.
Clematis
Fortunately, the most spectacular clematis are also the best suited to con-
tainers. These are the deciduous hybrids with the beautiful, huge, six-petaled 
flowers in blue, purple, red, and many other shades. The vines can climb as 
high as 20 feet. Use one in a container with a trellis or train the vine up and 
over an entryway. Choose from many varieties at your local nursery or in 
mail-order catalogs.
Provide full sun or part shade. Conventional wisdom says to put the plant in 
a place where the container is in shade and the uppermost growth is in the 
sun if you can find such a location: The idea is to keep the roots cool and the 
flower buds exposed to light. The roots need plenty of room; make sure the 
container’s at least 16 inches deep. The soil mix must drain quickly; don’t let 
it dry out. For top flower production, proper pruning is critical and depends 
on variety; consult with local experts.
Most are hardy in zones 4 to 9. You may need to move clematis into a pro-
tected spot for the winter. Sweet autumn clematis (C. terniflora) is classified 
as an invasive plant in some parts of the country.

156

English ivy (Hedera helix)
English ivy is easy to train and, in a container, easy to bring indoors. Let 
English ivy drape from a hanging basket filled with shade-loving annual flow-
ers. Train it into topiary shapes. Use it in a container where it can climb up a 
trellis or wall, like in an entry or on a patio. Choose from among hundreds of 
varieties: with leaves of different shapes, sizes, variegations, and so on.
Provide part or full shade, or even full sun in cool climates. Keep the soil 
moist. Pinch young plants to encourage bushy growth. English ivy is hardy 
in zones 5 or 6 to 9. Bring plants indoors during the winter in cold regions. 
English ivy is considered an invasive plant in some parts of the country.
Mandevilla
You can find this tropical vine sold almost everywhere during the warm 
months. Buy it in bloom, move it into a 12-inch-wide container or hanging 
basket, and enjoy it for the summer. Flowers of Mandevilla amabilis Alice du 
Pont are big pink trumpets, up to 4 inches wide.
Provide full sun or part shade. Keep the soil moist. Feed at least monthly.
Mandevilla is hardy in zones 10 and 11. Frost kills the plant. Try bringing it 
indoors and growing it in a sunny window for the winter.
Star jasmine (Trachelospermum 
jasminoides)
With its glossy evergreen foliage and wonderfully sweet white flowers in 
summer, star jasmine deserves a spot in any garden where it can grow. In 
a container, train star jasmine up a trellis or espalier and tie it to a nearby 
wall — wherever you can appreciate its fragrance.
Provide full sun or part shade in hot climates. The soil should be kept moist 
for best growth, although plants can withstand dry conditions. Pinch branch 
tips of young plants to encourage bushy growth. Shear older plants after 
bloom to shape growth. This plant is easy to grow, and is hardy in zones 8 to 
10. Star jasmine can be moved indoors for the winter in colder climates.

157
 Chapter 12: Sprucing Up Your Space with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines
Wisteria
Chinese wisteria (W. sinensis) and Japanese wisteria (W. floribunda) are prob-
ably the ones that come to mind with their thick, woody vines dripping with 
fragrant blossoms. Both grow into enormous plants and are classified as 
invasive in many regions. Instead, consider the more manageable and well-
behaved native species, American wisteria (W. frutescens). Train it on a trellis 
or frame, or prune it into a small, single-trunk tree over a number of years. 
The plant produces the familiar clusters of purple-blue or white blossoms.
Provide full sun and a strong support. Wisteria is hardy in zones 6 to 9.
Checking Out a Few Hard-
to-Classify Plants
The following plants don’t fall neatly into any of the above categories — at 
least not to a botanist. Although they can be used in similar garden situations 
(to add height and provide privacy, for example) they aren’t true woody 
plants. So in the spirit of botanical correctness we’ve created a separate cat-
egory for them.
Bamboo
Statuesque in a container, bamboo actually is a giant grass. One reason to 
grow it in containers is to confine the running types that can take over a 
garden if let loose in the ground. Bamboo looks great as a single plant or 
combined with small pines or azaleas. Or plant several to create a privacy 
screen.
Many kinds are available. Golden bamboo, a notorious spreader, is easy; 
black bamboo is striking. Both grow to 8 feet tall. Provide full sun or part 
shade. Plant bamboo in a container at least 15 inches in diameter. Treat it 
like a grass — don’t let it dry out. You can bring bamboo indoors for the 
winter — just make sure to provide lots of light. Hardiness varies by species.

158
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Palms
Indoors and outdoors, palms are proven winners as traditional potted plants. 
Actually, most kinds benefit from an arrangement that keeps them outdoors 
for the warm months and indoors when frost threatens. (Flip to Chapter 14 
for details on indoor container gardening.) In the mildest climates, palms 
can live outdoors all the time. They make striking container plants for decks, 
patios, and doorways. Consider the following varieties:
 
✓ Kentia palm (Howea belmoreana) is up to 7 feet, with a pretty, feathery 
look. Lady palm (Rhapis excelsa) reaches 10 or 12 feet. This is a terrific 
indoor plant, tolerating low light. Slender stems grow in clusters like 
bamboo.
 
✓ Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis) can take a few degrees 
of frost. It’s great in containers when young and small. Growth is 
clumpy, with fan-shaped leaves.
 
✓ Parlor palm (Chamaedorea elegans) is a classic. It grows just 3 or 4 feet 
tall, with a single trunk and feathery leaves. Fit three or four plants in 
one container to create a grove effect.
 
✓ Pygmy date palm (Phoenix roebelenii) reaches 6 feet — very slowly. It 
develops a single trunk and a dense, feathery-leafed top.
Outdoors, grow palms in part shade or even full shade, protected from wind, 
which can tatter fronds. Indoors, palms get along on average light conditions. 
Plant in a container just a bit larger than the nursery container. Keep the soil 
moist. Fertilize as often as once a month during growing season. Watch for 
spider mites (see Chapter 18), and hose off palms every few weeks to wash 
away dust and insects.
Sago palm (Cycas revoluta)
Botanists tell us that this is not a true palm, but rather a cycad. It may fool 
you, too. Regardless, it’s a bold container plant, with slow-growing, spiky 
fronds arising from a central core that take years to grow taller than 2 or 3 
feet. Provide part or full shade. Water and fertilize lightly. Sago palm is hardy 
in zones 9 or 10 to 11. Bring it indoors during cold weather.

▶ Discovering the characteristics of winning candidates for containers
▶ Finding out what fruit producers need
▶ Looking at the plants you have to pick from
W
hile growing flowers and vegetables in containers can be a snap, 
growing fruit trees and berries takes a little more forethought. You 
need to become familiar with such things as rootstocks, pollination, and cli-
mate adaptation. You may need to prune and thin. We get to all those details 
in this chapter, but first, the good news.
Growing your own fruit is tremendously rewarding. Nothing, and we mean 
nothing, tastes better than homegrown fruit harvested at peak ripeness. 
Imagine the pleasure of adding a handful of blueberries or strawberries to 
your cereal in the morning or serving an apple pie made with home-grown 
fruit from the tree on your deck. And fruiting plants can also be quite good-
looking — many have colorful, fragrant flowers, attractive foliage, and, of 
course, beautiful fruit.
Many types of fruits and berries adapt nicely to growing in containers. And 
plant breeders continue to develop compact varieties especially suited to 
container growing. Growing fruit in containers has advantages, as well. Most 
noteworthy is the mobility that containers provide. If frost threatens, you can 
move your fruit trees under cover for protection. So although container fruit 
growing takes a little more effort than growing flowers or vegetables, the pay-
offs are well worth it. In the second half of this chapter, we list berry plants 
and fruit trees that are easy to grow in containers, and we give you some tips 
for each one to help make your efforts fruitful (pun intended!).

A Bowl of Fruit Facts
Before you can set off on your growing adventure, you need to pack in a few 
fruit-gardening terms and concepts that come up again and again in this chap-
ter. We concentrate on deciduous fruit trees (apples, peaches, and so on) 
because they’re the most complex and also the most rewarding. The following 
sections explain the biology of how trees come to bear fruit and how normally 
large fruit trees are cultivated to be suitable for container gardening.
Pollinating: It’s the bee’s knees
You probably remember from Biology 101 all about how pollen moves from 
the male part of the flower to the female part, fertilizing it, and causing a fruit 
to grow. Some fruit trees, like peaches, have compatible male and female 
flower parts on the same plant — this kind of plant is called self-fruitful. You 
can grow one peach tree — or other self-fruitful plant — by itself, and it will 
produce fruit.
Other fruits, including some apples and blueberries, produce more and 
better quality fruit if they’re cross-pollinated, which means that they receive 
pollen from another variety. You can grow one apple or one blueberry plant 
and probably get some fruit, but you’ll get much better production if you 
have a second, different variety growing nearby. For example, if you plant 
one or two Bluecrop blueberries, you’ll get some fruit, but if you plant one 
each of Bluecrop and Earliblue varieties of blueberry, you’ll get a bigger, 
better harvest.
For some fruits, such as plums, you need a specific variety (usually one that 
blooms at the same time) for proper cross-pollination.
So now that you know about pollen, what about pollinators? Pollinators carry 
pollen from flower to flower, or even from one part of a flower to another 
part. Pollinators are usually bees, flies, or other insects, and you probably 
have plenty of those in your garden. Even city dwellers will have bees and 
flies buzzing around, especially if they plant flowers nearby.
 
Planting a combination of flowers, veggies, and fruits makes your container 
garden a one-stop shopping place for our pollinating friends.

 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
Downsizing fruit trees for containers
Most fruit trees have two parts: the rootstock and the scion. The rootstock is 
the below-ground portion of the plant. The scion is the above-ground, fruiting 
part of the plant. The point at which a scion joins the rootstock is called the 
graft union or bud union. The graft union (as we choose to call it) is usually 
indicated by a swollen or curved part of the trunk a few inches above the soil 
level. Below the graft union is the rootstock; above is the scion.
Why are there two parts? We figured you’d ask. In simple terms, when nurser-
ies grow fruit trees, they bud or graft (methods of fusing or joining two closely 
related plants) the scion variety onto the rootstock to take advantage of the 
best attributes of each plant.
Obviously, the scion produces great tasting fruit — that’s a considerable 
attribute. But a good rootstock can contribute qualities like adaptation to 
specific soil types, hardiness, or size control. Size control? Yes, size control. 
And that’s why we brought up this whole rootstock-scion business in the first 
place.
If grown on their own roots, most fruit trees get huge — way too big to grow 
in containers. But if grown on rootstocks that keep them smaller, called 
dwarfing rootstocks, these same fruit trees become ideal for containers. 
Apples perfectly demonstrate the value of dwarfing rootstocks. A normal 
apple tree can grow up to 40 feet high. But the same variety grown on a 
dwarfing apple rootstock can be reduced in size by over 75 percent, reaching 
just 10 feet tall.
Not every type of fruit is available as a dwarfing rootstock. But luckily, 
another type of elfish fruit tree exists — a genetic dwarf. The genetic dwarf 
fruit tree is naturally smaller. For example, a standard (normal size) peach 
tree may reach 25 feet high. A genetic dwarf peach rarely gets over 6 feet 
high — perfect for containers. The number of genetic dwarf fruit tree variet-
ies available is growing. Unfortunately, their fruit isn’t always as good as that 
of standard varieties, but it’s certainly better than store-bought fruit!
 
If you have a favorite variety of fruit, look for it on a dwarfing rootstock first. If 
you can’t find one, check to see whether it’s available as a genetic dwarf.
Semi-dwarfing rootstocks dwarf the trees about 25 to 50 percent. Depending 
upon the type of fruit tree and variety, these may also be good choices for 
large containers.

Selecting Plants for Their 
Container-Friendly Traits
Certain characteristics make some fruits better than others for growing in 
containers. But first and foremost, grow what you like to eat! If you love fresh 
strawberries on your cereal, by all means give them a go. If blueberries are 
your morning fruit of choice, plant those. And if you live in Minnesota but 
still dream of having a lemon tree, containers make it possible.
 
One of the great things about growing in containers is that you can modify 
soil mixes and move plants as necessary to provide the best conditions, so 
don’t be afraid to experiment. Fruits that wouldn’t thrive out in your garden 
may adapt well to growing in containers. The following sections indicate some 
other considerations when choosing fruit plants for containers.
Small size
Some fruiting plants are just smaller than others and, consequently, make 
easy container subjects. Strawberries, for example, grow on tiny, clumpy 
plants that are perfect for pots.
Even within fruit types, some varieties can be better for containers than 
others. Meyer lemons, for instance, are compact plants that easily stay below 
6 feet in a large container. Eureka lemons, on the other hand, get huge — 
upward of 20 feet — not a good container choice.
 
You can keep some fruit trees smaller with vigorous pruning, but the roots 
still eventually outgrow the container. In that case, you may want to try root 
pruning (see Chapter 17).
Climate adaptation
Not all fruits can be grown everywhere. Fruit trees have varying degrees of 
hardiness to winter cold temperatures. Many also need a certain amount of 
winter cold (called chilling hours) before they bloom and set fruit; types that 
set fruit in mild winters are called low-chill. Some, like peaches, grow best 
where summers are hot and dry. Others, like raspberries, prefer cool sum-
mers. Remarkable differences in adaptation even exist among different variet-
ies of the same fruit type. The point is, if you want to grow quality fruit, select 
types and varieties that are well adapted to your area. To find out for sure, 
ask your local nursery person or Cooperative Extension agent.

163
 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
 
Fruits grown in containers are less winter-hardy than those grown in the 
ground. Even hardy trees and shrubs, such as apples and blueberries, need 
winter protection in cold climates. Move evergreen citrus and other semitropi-
cals into a greenhouse or indoors in winter. Chapter 10 provides details on 
overwintering container-grown plants.
Basic Planting and Maintenance
Most good potting soils work fine for growing fruit and berries (see Chapter 4). 
Blueberries are an exception — they require a very acidic soil, which can be 
created by mixing any good potting mix with 50 percent peat moss.
In general, the bigger the container the better, as demonstrated in Figure 
13-1. For most fruit, you need at least a 15-gallon size container or one with at 
least an 18- to 24-inch-wide diameter. Half barrels work well. Strawberries and 
some dwarf blueberries can be grown in smaller pots. (For more on contain-
ers, see Chapter 3.)

164
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Fruit and berries can be purchased bare-root (without any soil around their 
roots) during the dormant season or already growing in containers at other 
times of year. We cover planting techniques in Chapter 5.
Fruits and berries need full sun and regular water and fertilizer. Skimp on any 
of these, and you’ll get reduced yields and poorer fruit quality. For more spe-
cific cultural requirements, see the fruit descriptions in the upcoming sections.
Pruning techniques vary for each type of fruit. To get the full scoop, you’d 
need a book dedicated to growing fruit. However, some basic techniques 
apply to most types:
 
✓ Remove criss-crossing, diseased, or dead branches.
 
✓ Prune out some of the inward-facing branches to allow light to penetrate 
the canopy and to increase air circulation.
 
✓ Try to keep branches evenly spaced around the plant so it doesn’t 
become lopsided.
 
✓ Remove old or unproductive branches. Allow young, vigorous branches 
to take their places.
 
✓ In general, prune peaches and nectarines more severely than other fruit 
trees.
Some fruit trees produce so much fruit that, if you don’t remove some, you 
end up with nothing but small fruit at harvest time. Removing fruit before 
they reach maturity is called thinning. Apples, peaches, nectarines, and 
plums all have to be thinned by hand, or the fruit will turn out small. The 
best time to thin is in early spring, when the fruit is about the size of a quar-
ter. Simply pinch off the small fruit so that you have one remaining fruit per 
cluster and about 6 to 8 inches between fruit. Thinning can be a bit painful, 
especially with genetic dwarf trees, where you may have to remove more 
than 75 percent of the young fruit to achieve the proper spacing. But if you 
don’t do it, you’ll later regret your restraint.
 
The day will come when you want to move your plant from one side of the 
deck to the other, or you’ll need to move it indoors for the winter. If you need 
some pointers on how to best move a heavy, soil-filled pot and plant without 
doing too much harm to the plant, pot, or yourself, flip to Chapter 17 where 
we offer some useful moving strategies.

165
 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
Cherry-Picking Fruits and 
Berries for Containers
With persistence and constant care, almost any fruit or berry can be grown in a 
container, but some are much easier than others. In the following sections, we 
describe the less-demanding possibilities and give you tips for growing each 
type. We also tell you about some of the different varieties that are available, 
and offer insights into which ones are best adapted to various climates.
Small fruits
These are perfect for first-time fruit-growers. Blueberries and strawberries are 
easy to grow, produce fruit relatively quickly, and are forgiving if you make a 
minor mistake. Also, they don’t take up too much space. And they’re yummy!
Blueberries
Blueberries adapt well to growing in containers as long as you give them the 
acidic soil they require. You can choose from low, half-high, and high bush 
varieties. The plants are very attractive, with pretty spring flowers and hand-
some foliage that turns bright red before dropping in fall.
 
✓ Growing tips: Purchase a special potting mix formulated for blueberries 
and other acid-loving plants, or create your own by mixing equal parts 
standard potting soil and peat moss. Plant at least two different varieties 
to ensure cross-pollination (you can plant three in one large container). 
Mix early-, mid-, and late-season varieties for a long harvest season. 
Prune regularly to renew fruiting wood. In hot summer areas, grow in 
part shade. Don’t let plants dry out. Fertilize with an acidic plant food 
like one formulated for azaleas and rhododendrons.
 
✓ Adaptation: Most blueberries prefer areas with cool summers and cold 
winters, but different types demonstrate varying adaptation. Lowbush 
blueberries, such as Tophat, reach about 2 feet high and are grown 
mostly in northern climates. Half-high blueberries, such as North 
Country and Northsky, are very hardy and grow only 18 to 24 inches 
high. They can be grown in smaller pots. Highbush blueberries are the 
familiar supermarket type. They reach up to 6 feet high and need a 
large container to produce their best crop. There are varieties adapted 
to southern regions (for example Misty and Sharpblue) and northern 
regions (Earliblue and Blueray). Rabbiteye blueberries, such as Tifblue, 
grow better in hot-summer climates, like the southeastern United States.

166
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Strawberries
Few edible plants are as well adapted to container life as strawberries. Their 
neat, compact habit fits perfectly into even small containers. Strawberries can 
also be grown in hanging baskets and even have a pot named after them — see 
Chapter 5 for information about planting a strawberry jar. In larger containers, 
like a half barrel, you can put in enough strawberry plants to provide a pretty 
substantial harvest — a large raised bed of strawberries can feed the neigh-
borhood. And the plants are really attractive — they exhibit dark green, lobed 
leaves; lovely white flowers; and pure poetry in the way the fruit dangles over 
the edge of a pot.
There are three types of strawberries. June-bearing varieties, such as 
Earliglow and Jewel, produce one big crop in late spring or early summer. 
Everbearing varieties, such as Tribute and Tristar, produce a more prolonged 
harvest over the entire summer — you don’t get as much fruit all at once, but 
you get fruit for a longer period. Alpine strawberries, such as Mignonette, 
produce small, sweet fruit all summer long. They don’t produce runners 
(stringlike arms that set out roots), so they’re great for smaller containers.
 
✓ Growing tips: You can start with bare-root plants in winter or plant from 
six-packs any time. Strawberries are self-fruitful, and the fruit doesn’t 
need to be thinned. However, if you pinch off the first flowers that form 
on newly planted strawberries, the plants have a better chance to get 
established and give you more fruit later. Strawberry plants reproduce 
themselves by sending out new plants (babies) at the end of runners. 
Wherever the runners land, they set roots and grow. If you let all the 
babies take hold, your container will become overcrowded and start to 
decline in production. To prevent this, thin out the plants occasionally, 
removing the oldest ones.
 
 Strawberry plants begin producing poorly when they’re about 3 years 
old, so plan to get rid of them then. You can clip off the runners and 
replant the babies, or purchase new plants and start over.
Feed the birds . . . not!
Most gardeners welcome birds into their 
landscapes — except when fruit is ripening. A 
few birds can devour or damage every straw-
berry or blueberry in short order, sometimes 
just minutes before you head out to harvest. If 
you’re growing fruits, assume that birds will find 
the plants and protect them before they start 
ripening. Cover plantings with chicken wire or 
bird netting, securing it to the container so birds 
can’t find their way underneath, and propping 
up the covering so birds can’t reach through the 
holes to get at the fruit.

167
 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
 
✓ Adaptation: Strawberries can be grown almost anywhere as long as you 
choose locally adapted varieties, and you can find many of these. Check 
with your local nursery for the best varieties for your area. Everbearing 
varieties can be grown as annuals: Plant in early spring for a late 
summer harvest.
Brambles
The term brambles refers to plants in the genus Rubus. The plants produce 
long, usually thorny stems called canes and small, juicy aggregate fruit (made 
up of individual little drupelets, in case you want to know). Brambles are 
some of the easiest fruits to grow in the garden, but can be challenging in 
containers because of their rampant growth.
Blackberries
Most blackberries are too vigorous, thorny, and rangy to grow in containers 
easily. They really need more room and a trellis to do the job right. But a few 
varieties of thornless blackberries, like Arapaho and Navaho, are easier to 
handle and can be grown without a trellis in a large container.
 
✓ Growing tips: Plant three to five plants in a half barrel or similar-size 
container. Let the canes grow about 4 feet tall during the first summer; 
then pinch the tips to force lateral branches. The following spring, pinch 
the laterals back to 2 feet long; fruit will appear soon after. The following 
winter, remove the canes that have borne fruit, and repeat the process 
with the new canes that grow from the base of the old ones.
 
✓ Adaptation: Blackberries are one of the more widely adapted berries, 
growing well almost anywhere they’re planted.
Raspberries
Unlike their close cousins, the blackberries, raspberries can be grown rela-
tively easily in containers if you choose the right varieties and handle them 
properly — and if you live in the right area (see the following “Adaptation” 
bullet).
 
✓ Growing tips: Raspberries are self-fruitful and don’t require fruit thin-
ning. Plant three to five plants per half barrel or similar size container.
 
 Try everbearing varieties like Heritage, Fall Gold, or Fall Red, all of which 
normally produce two crops when grown in the ground (one in early 
summer and one in fall). Prune the summer-bearing canes after they 
finish fruiting. The new growth will produce a crop in fall and again the 
next summer. If you want to focus on just a fall crop, cut all the canes 

168
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
to the ground in late fall or winter. The new growth that emerges the 
following spring will produce a crop in fall only. You’ll sacrifice the 
summer crop, but get a larger fall crop.
 
✓ Adaptation: Raspberries grow best where summers are relatively cool 
and winters are cold. Bababerry is one variety that grows better in mild-
winter, hot-summer areas.
Tree fruits
Apples, peaches, and other tree fruits are ideal candidates for containers. 
Beautiful spring flowers followed by luscious fruit — what’s not to love? Fruit 
trees do require a bit more care than other fruits, especially when it comes to 
managing insects and diseases. (Chapter 18 provides lots of tips to help you 
out.) The results are well worth the extra effort.
 
If you want full-sized fruit on your apple, peach, plum, or nectarine tree you 
have to remove some of the fruit by hand, called thinning, which lets the tree 
focus its energy on the remaining fruit. When the fruit is about the size of a 
quarter, pinch off all but one fruit per cluster, leaving the remaining fruit are 
6 to 8 inches apart. Don’t feel bad about removing so many developing fruit; 
you’ll be rewarded come harvest time.
Apples
Most apple varieties are available grown on a nice selection of dwarfing root-
stocks that allow you to choose almost any size tree. The rootstocks are usu-
ally labeled Mark, EMLA, or MM plus a number. One of many good rootstocks 
for containers is EMLA 27, which usually gives you a 5- to 7-foot-high tree.
To find the best selection of apple trees grown on dwarfing rootstocks, 
browse the mail-order catalogs listed in the appendix. Some genetic dwarfs 
are also available (sometimes called spur varieties, like spur Gold Delicious) 
which are smaller than standard varieties. If space is really at a premium, 
look for colonnade apple trees, which grow just 8 feet high and 2 feet wide. 
Northpole and Golden Sentinel are two good varieties to try.
 
✓ Growing tips: Most apples need cross-pollination to produce a good 
crop, so you may need to plant more than one variety. Trees need regu-
lar pruning to remain productive. The fruit must be thinned if you want 
large apples.
 
✓ Adaptation: If you choose the right varieties, apples can be grown 
almost anywhere temperatures don’t fall below –20 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Varieties like Red Astrachan, Haralson, and Honeycrisp are particularly 
hardy. In mild-winter areas, choose low-chill varieties like Anna and 
Dorsett Golden.

169
 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
Apricots
Apricot trees generally get too big (about 15 feet) to grow in containers for 
any prolonged period. However, some catalogs sell varieties on dwarfing 
rootstocks, which may reduce their size by 25 to 50 percent. The smaller 
trees, such as Moorpark, are the best choice for containers.
 
✓ Growing tips: Some varieties need cross-pollination to produce fruit; 
others are self-fruitful. Trees require annual pruning to remain healthy 
and fruitful. The fruit must be thinned to reach full size.
 
✓ Adaptation: Apricots have a rather limited range of adaptation, pre-
ferring areas with long, dry summers. In other areas, they’re prone to 
disease. Trees also bloom very early, making the blossoms subject to 
frost damage. In areas where apricots don’t grow well, try Flavor Delight 
aprium, a plum-apricot hybrid with wider adaptation and an apricot-like 
flavor. For pollination, plant it near a Flavor Supreme pluot (plew-ott), a 
similar hybrid with fruit more like a plum.
Citrus
Where winter temperatures don’t fall much below 26 degrees Fahrenheit, 
many varieties of citrus make excellent container plants year-round. In other 
areas, trees can be brought indoors (only a well-lit, cool spot with ample 
light and humidity can keep the tree healthy) or into heated greenhouses for 
protection during winter. Plants have deep green, evergreen foliage, fragrant 
spring flowers, and very colorful fruit — all in all, they make very handsome 
container subjects.
Some of the naturally smaller citrus that can thrive in containers for years 
include Meyer lemon, Bearss lime, and the hardier Nagami kumquat and 
Satsuma mandarins. Otherwise, grow just about any variety grafted on Flying 
Dragon dwarf rootstock for the perfect 6- to 8-foot-high container tree.
 
✓ Growing tips: Most varieties are self-fruitful and don’t need to be 
pruned to remain productive. Feed with fertilizers that contain zinc, 
iron, and manganese to avoid micronutrient deficiencies (see Chapter 16 
for more information).
 
✓ Adaptation: Varieties vary by cold hardiness and the amount of summer 
heat that they need to ripen fruit. In very cool summer areas, grow 
acidic fruit like lemons and limes.
Cherries
Normally quite large trees (upwards of 35 feet), most sweet cherries are not 
well-adapted to growing in containers. Dwarfing rootstocks, like Giessen, 
result in a tree half the size — still pretty large to stay in a container for very 
long. There are bush cherries available, such as Jan and Joel, that get 4 feet 
tall and wide. You need two varieties for cross-pollination.

170
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Growing tips: Most varieties must be matched carefully with another 
to ensure cross-pollination. Some, like Dwarf Northstar, are self-fruitful. 
Prune annually to keep trees healthy and productive.
 
✓ Adaptation: Local variety adaptation is very important. Cherries are 
best grown in areas with mild, dry summers. In other areas diseases can 
run rampant.
Figs
With beautiful, large, lobed, tropical-looking leaves, figs are really eye-catching 
in containers. Although they’re normally quite large trees (up to 40 feet high), 
severe pruning can keep them more pot-size — and they still bear fruit. Figs 
are only hardy to about 15 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can be brought into a 
cool garage to get them through cold winters.
 
✓ Growing tips: Figs are pretty much carefree — just keep plants watered, 
fertilized, and if necessary, protected in winter. Some good varieties to 
try are Brown Turkey and Petite Negri.
 
✓ Adaptation: Other than the sensitivity to cold temperatures we mention 
earlier, figs are widely adapted.
Peaches and nectarines
Peaches and nectarines are closely related plants. In fact, a nectarine is just a 
fuzzless peach.
Both types of fruit are available in genetic dwarf varieties, like El Dorado, 
Garden Gold, and Stark Sensation peaches and the nectarine, Nectarcrest. 
All are perfectly suited to container growing. They’re attractive trees with a 
compact, muscular-looking appearance. They reach about 4 to 6 feet high in 
a container and are self-fruitful.
 
✓ Growing tips: Prune the trees annually to keep the center open. Thin 
heavily to ensure large fruit at harvest time.
 
✓ Adaptation: Peaches and nectarines are best adapted to areas with hot, 
dry summers. They can be grown in other areas, but diseases are more 
troublesome.
Pears
Pears are available on dwarfing rootstocks, but the result is still a tree that 
can reach 10 to 15 feet high, pretty big for all but the biggest container. 
However, pears are quite attractive trees with glossy foliage, nice fall color, 
and white spring flowers — they may be worth a try.

171
 Chapter 13: Nurturing Fruits and Berries
 
✓ Growing tips: Fruit thinning usually isn’t necessary. Some varieties need 
cross-pollination. Otherwise, pears are pretty easy to care for.
 
✓ Adaptation: European varieties like Bartlett, Bosc, and Comice are 
best adapted to dry summer areas that have fairly cold winters. Hybrid 
pears, like Kieffer, often have lower chilling requirements. Asian pears, 
which are hard like an apple (they’re often called pear apples), are 
widely adapted.
Plums
Plums are generally too large to remain healthy in anything but the largest 
container for more than a few years. Some varieties are available on dwarfing 
rootstocks, but even these can get over 10 feet high.
 
✓ Growing tips: Prune regularly to keep them healthy and productive. 
Thin to maintain fruit size. Japanese plums, the type you see in super-
markets, require another variety nearby for cross-pollination. European 
plums, or prunes, are self-fruitful.
 
✓ Adaptation: Plum trees are widely adapted but subject to diseases in 
areas with warm, wet summers. Japanese plums bloom early and are 
subject to frost damage.
And just a few more
Many other, less common fruiting plants can be grown in containers. In mild 
winter areas, you may want to try tropical plants, like bananas and guavas, 
or slightly hardier plants, like pomegranate, loquat, and pineapple guava 
(Feijoa). In colder areas, experiment with currants, elderberries, and 
gooseberries.

Chapter 14
Indoor Container Gardening
In This Chapter
▶ Finding the right fit with indoor plants
▶ Selecting containers and soil
▶ Getting the caretaking specifics for some indoor possibilities
D
o you live in a high-rise, ten stories up, with no garden or even a 
balcony? Does your house or apartment lack that certain something, 
despite all the effort you’ve put into decorating and artwork? To us, an 
apartment or house without any indoor plants lacks a sense of life and 
always benefits from an infusion of nature. Not everyone is up to owning 
a conservatory filled with exotic trees, vines, and shrubs, but anyone can 
grow at least a few indoor plants.
Plus, indoor gardening offers benefits beyond decor — many plants are known 
to improve air quality. Spider plant, ivy, mother-in-law’s tongue, and bamboo 
plant are among those found to absorb toxins from the air. In addition, plants 
use up carbon dioxide while releasing oxygen during photosynthesis. So take a 
deep, refreshing breath, and read on for details on how to nurture your indoor 
garden. We focus here on plants that are reasonably easy to grow indoors, 
along with a few special plants that require a bit of extra care but are worth it. 
Finally, we look at a few edibles you can grow indoors.
Matching a Plant’s Needs to Your Home
From small African violets to towering ficus trees, the indoor plant possibili-
ties are as limitless as your budget, patience, and imagination. Most plants 
sold as houseplants are native to the tropics, and these are usually the easi-
est to care for. That’s because most people keep their homes at a relatively 
constant, warm temperature year-round, mimicking a tropical climate. A few 
require more temperature variation and other exacting conditions to perform 
their best, making them a bit more challenging.

174
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
When choosing plants, keep three things in mind: the light level where you’ll 
keep the plant, the plant’s shape and size, and, for lack of a better word, 
its fussiness — how challenging it is to keep it happy and healthy. Later in 
the chapter you find a list of plants that includes this information. But first, 
here’s an overview of these factors.
 
Some indoor plants are toxic if ingested, so if you have pets that tend to nibble 
now and then, stick to nontoxic plants. The American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists toxic plants at www.aspca.
org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/.
Assessing the amount of light
Like outdoor plants, houseplant species vary widely in their light prefer-
ences. Some need a sunny window to thrive; others suffer leaf scorch in 
direct sun and prefer lower light levels. A few plants will even survive in a 
corner that receives little light.
 
One rule of thumb is that if it’s too dark to read a book, it’s probably too dark 
for any plant to thrive.
If you’re buying a new plant to fill a particular spot, take the time to evalu-
ate the amount of light that area receives. Does the spot get any direct sun? 
Plants in curtainless, south-facing windows will get the most sun (unless a 
tree, balcony, eave, or building blocks the light). Look for plants labeled for 
high-light levels for these spots. East-facing windows get morning sun, and 
west-facing windows get afternoon sun. These areas are good for medium-
light plants. North-facing windows get bright light but no direct sun and are 
fine for medium- to low-light plants. Plants that aren’t near windows are gen-
erally in low-light areas.
 
Keep in mind that sheer curtains block some light, and that drawn shades and 
heavy curtains turn a bright-light area into a low-light one.
Selecting a plant for its size and shape
As you would with outdoor plants, match the shape and size of indoor plants 
to the location. Houseplants grow relatively slowly, and most can be kept in 
bounds with regular pruning and occasional root pruning (refer to Chapter 
17 for details), but it just makes sense to buy a plant that suits the spot right 
off the bat.
Tall, narrow plants, like some dracaenas, fit neatly into a corner. Palms, 
on the other hand, need room for their arching fronds — they look silly 
squished against a wall. Some indoor plants have sharp-edged leaves, 

175
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
so place these where they won’t harm passersby. Some houseplants are 
vines that can drape down or be trained to grow up on a trellis or around a 
window frame.
Getting a feel for a plant’s fussiness
Next time you’re at the mall or doctor’s office, look at the indoor plants. (And 
rest assured — there will be plants!) Most likely, the plants you’ll see will be 
among the most reliable and the easiest to care for.
Building a terrarium
For a really self-sufficient indoor garden, try 
a terrarium (see the accompanying figure). 
Closed up in a large jar or aquarium, this kind of 
garden creates its own atmosphere and mois-
ture. A terrarium needs only a good start in life, 
an occasional breath of fresh air, and, if neces-
sary, the removal or addition of a plant here and 
there. Just follow these steps:
 1. Start with a clear glass or plastic bottle, 
dish, or aquarium.
 
 A cover is optional.
 2. Add a layer of aquarium gravel (up to 2 
inches), cover with a thin layer of char-
coal, and top with material to serve as a 
screen.
 
 Plastic or a layer of sheet moss or land-
scape cloth will do the trick.
 3. Add soil, and start planting.
 
 Create your own little world by incorpo-
rating rocks, driftwood, tiny dinosaurs, 
or whatever accessories appeal to your 
imagination.

176
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
Some indoor plants (especially those growing in low light levels) need very 
little to keep them going. A bit of water (perhaps as rarely as once a month) 
plus one or two fertilizer applications per year and an occasional pruning or 
removal of dead leaves are all these plants need. They thrive on neglect — 
you can actually kill by paying too much attention to them — and they’re at 
the low end of the fussiness scale.
At the other end are plants that require daily nurturing — misting to increase 
humidity or moving from room to room to provide just the right light levels 
and temperatures. If you like challenges, by all means give them a try. But 
don’t take it personally if they drop leaves, won’t produce flowers, or kick the 
bucket entirely. In the list of individual plants later in this chapter, we com-
ment on how easy or challenging the plants are to maintain.
 
Indoor plants high on the fussiness scale include azaleas, cyclamen, gardenia, 
gerber daisies, maidenhair fern, and poinsettia. Consider them short-term 
plants and enjoy them while they last. If you can keep them healthy, give your-
self a pat on the back.
Presenting a Pretty Plant
When you purchase a plant, it’ll most likely be in a cheap plastic pot — not 
the most attractive look to display in your home. So you may want to trans-
plant the plant into a pretty pot. For that, you’ll need a container and some 
soil. The next sections give you some guidance on what to use. (See Chapter 
5 for help on replanting in a new container.)
Choosing containers
Considering the wide array of available container styles, you can safely let 
interior design or personal taste guide your selection when choosing a pot 
for an indoor plant. The only requirement, as always, is to make sure the 
bottom of the container has a drainage hole. Don’t despair if your choice is a 
gorgeous copper pot with no hole: Just set the plant in a plastic pot, set the 
pot in a saucer, and put both in the copper pot. Keep in mind that you need 
to be able to drain any excess water from the saucer.
 
Before choosing a decorative container, remove the plant from its plastic 
nursery pot and examine the roots. If the plant is root-bound — with a tight, 
tangled root ball or roots circling the inside of the pot — then choose a deco-
rative pot that’s an inch or two larger in diameter and depth than the current 
pot. Otherwise, you can repot in a similarly sized container.

177
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
Refer to Chapter 3 for tips on selecting containers: The same general prin-
ciples apply indoors and out. Remember that you need something waterproof 
under plants to keep them from damaging furniture and other surfaces. It 
helps to put heavy plants on a dolly, so you can roll them out of the way to 
clean underneath them.
Getting the right soil mix
If you decide to repot your plant into a container that’s larger than its current 
home, you need some soil to fill the extra space. A general indoor potting mix 
is adequate for most plants. Exceptions are orchids and cactuses, and you 
can find commercial specialty mixes clearly labeled for both types (if you 
want more information about growing cactuses, head to Chapter 20). Most 
indoor plants need generally well-draining soil, but there are always excep-
tions. The orchids that we discuss later in the chapter are epiphytes, accus-
tomed to growing on the trunks of trees: When grown indoors, they need to 
grow in a medium containing little soil and a lot of bark. (See Chapter 4 for 
more on soil mixes.)
Keeping Your Plants Alive
Providing the right conditions and maintenance are the secrets to success 
with indoor plants. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know.
Providing the right amount of water
Some folks are overzealous and drown the poor things, while others let their 
plants dry up past redemption before noticing that it may be time to water. 
Find out how much water your plants require, and, if you have a difficult time 
remembering to check plants, use refrigerator notes, a calendar, or whatever 
works to jog your memory.
Unfortunately, there’s no easy formula to calculate how much water a plant 
needs. A range of factors influence how much water a particular plant needs, 
including its type and size, the amount of light it receives, the air tempera-
ture and humidity level, the size of the container and the material the con-
tainer is made from, how vigorously the plant is growing, and whether the 
plant is root-bound. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more information on factors that 
influence water needs.)

Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
As a general rule, it’s best to water the plants thoroughly so that the entire 
root ball is moistened. Let excess water drain, and then empty the saucer. 
Wait to water again until the soil has dried out slightly. Small plants in porous 
clay pots in a sunny window may need daily watering. A plant in a large, 
plastic container in a low-light corner may need watering as little as once a 
month.
 
Here’s a low-tech way to tell whether a plant needs watering: Stick your finger 
into the soil. If it’s dry, water it. There are exceptions to this rule, so pay atten-
tion to phrases like keep soil evenly moist and allow to dry out between water-
ings in plant descriptions.
 
Many plants grow more slowly in winter when days are shorter (there’s less 
daylight) than in summer, so water needs may drop. On the other hand, cen-
tral heating often dries the air, so some plants may need more frequent water-
ing as moisture evaporates more quickly from the soil.
For many indoor plants, providing humidity is just as important as water-
ing. Some require high humidity, making them a good choice for a bathroom 
window. You can also increase humidity by placing gravel in a tray or saucer, 
adding water, and setting the pot on top of the gravel so that the pot doesn’t 
actually sit in the water, but above it. Daily misting can briefly raise humidity, 
but it can also promote leaf diseases.
Tending to temperature
For most plants, ideal temperatures range between 55 and 75 degrees 
Fahrenheit — plants that come with descriptions such as cool, average, or 
high all fit into that range. Just like in their native habitats, plants indoors 
generally prefer cooler temperatures at night and in the winter. Most foliage 
plants are relatively adaptable. Some flowering plants, on the other hand, 
have strict requirements for day and/or night temperatures before they’ll set 
flower buds. Orchids, in particular, are fussy about temperatures, but they’re 
fussy about everything. You may need to move plants in winter to keep them 
away from cold drafts and heating vents. Don’t let plant foliage touch cold 
windows.
 
In cold-winter regions, take extra care to make sure plants stay warm during 
transit. When you buy a plant in cold weather, have the sales clerk wrap it in 
paper or plastic and take it right out into a heated car. Then take it directly 
home. A houseplant may suffer damage if temperatures drop into the 40s and 
may die if exposed to freezing temperatures. Don’t leave it in a cold car while 
you’re at a movie or dining out.

179
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
Maintaining adequate light levels
Keep an eye on light levels. A plant in front of a window may be shaded in 
midsummer when the sun is high in the sky, but receive direct sun the rest of 
the year when the sun is lower in the sky. Plants that thrive in summer in an 
out-of-the-way corner may do better if they’re moved closer to a window in 
winter, to take advantage of the limited daylight.
Some plants give you clues that they’re receiving too little or too much 
light. With too little light, stems may become elongated (with wider spaces 
between leaves), the leaves may be smaller than normal, and the colors of 
variegated plants may fade. In contrast, plants that prefer low light levels 
may show browned, burned leaf edges and splotches when placed in direct 
sunlight.
 
Because leaves turn toward light — trying to make the most of photosynthesis — 
you may eventually find many of your plants leaning toward the windows. If you 
want a more symmetrical look, turn pots every week or so. You may not want to 
bother with that 8-foot rubber tree in the corner — no one sees the other side 
anyway.
Nourishing with fertilizer
Just how big do you want that philodendron to be? Overfertilization can 
result in lush growth, requiring more frequent repotting and offering a dinner 
invitation to any stray insect pest that prefers soft new growth. On the other 
hand, underfertilizing results in plants that just look wan or worse.
Helping plants get acclimated
Houseplants are usually grown in climate-
controlled greenhouses where their every need 
is met. Bring them home and they almost always 
suffer some degree of shock, which often mani-
fests itself with dropped or yellowing leaves. As 
long as you put the plant in the appropriate light 
level, it should recover.
If you move plants outdoors for the summer, 
take time to acclimate them to the harsher out-
door conditions. Be sure that the weather has 
really warmed up before moving them outdoors. 
Then acclimate them slowly over the course 
of a few weeks by gradually exposing them 
to more and more sun and wind. Do the same 
thing in reverse in fall as the weather starts to 
cool. Place them in a shadier spot for a week or 
so to get them used to lower indoor light levels. 
And before you bring plants back inside, be 
sure to check for any hitchhiking pests. Look on 
the undersides of leaves, on the stems, on the 
soil surface, and on the bottom of the pot.

180
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
A happy medium for most indoor plants is to use a soluble fertilizer three 
times during spring and summer, when most plants do the majority of their 
growing. Exceptions to this are noted in the plant descriptions — as always, 
some plants are more demanding than others.
Fending off pests and diseases
Unfortunately, pest and disease problems do make their way indoors. As 
with outdoor plants, cultural factors come into play. If you put the right plant 
in the right place (meeting its requirements for light, water, humidity, and 
temperature), you’re much less likely to have a problem. The most common 
houseplant pests include scale, spider mites, mealybugs, and aphids, all of 
which can be controlled by washing them off or using sprays of insecticidal 
soap or horticultural oil. Quarantine affected plants to keep the pest from 
spreading to healthy plants. See Chapter 18 for more on pest and disease 
control.
Maintaining shape by pruning
Regularly snip off spent flowers, dead leaves, and stems. Cut leggy vines back 
to a node (where a leaf meets the stem); the plant will send out new shoots 
from there. (Occasionally cut a few of the longest vines right back to the leaf 
nearest the soil — the new sprouts will keep the pot looking full and lush.) 
Trees like ficus may need regular pruning to keep them in bounds.
Cleaning for well-being
Just like your furniture, houseplants benefit from regular dusting. Not only 
does it help them look their best, it also maximizes their ability to photosyn-
thesize by removing the dust accumulation that blocks light from reaching 
the leaves. You can wash most plants in the sink or shower, spraying the 
tops and bottoms of leaves with water to rinse off dust buildup (and any 
small insects that may be lurking). This is a good way to clean plants with 
lots of small leaves, like ivies and palms. Washing plants like this invariably 
saturates the soil, so let any excess water drain thoroughly. Another way to 
clean plants with large, smooth leaves, like dracaenas and crotons, is to wipe 
the tops and undersides of the leaves with a damp cloth. Don’t wash plants 
with fuzzy leaves, like African violets and begonias, because moisture on 
their leaves invite disease. Instead, use a soft brush to gently remove dust. 
Use leaf-shine products sparingly, if at all (and only on smooth-leaved plants) 
because they can clog the plants’ pores.

181
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
Selecting Plants for Different 
Light Levels
Because light level is the most important factor in choosing indoor plants, in the 
sections that follow, plants are grouped according to the amount of light they 
need for optimum growth. We also give you a brief description of the size and 
shape of the plant, how fussy it is, and specifics on the temperature, humidity, 
watering, and fertilizing requirements of those plants that need special care (the 
inevitable exceptions to the rules we provide in the previous sections).
Plants that get along in low light
Place plants that adapt well to low light in east or north windows, foyers, 
stair landings — anywhere that receives little or no direct sun. But remem-
ber, if it’s too dark for you to read a book, it’s too dark for a plant to grow 
there. The following plants fall into this category:
 
✓ Cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior): Dark green, elongated leaves grow 
vertically, reaching a height of up to 3 feet. Place this plant in an area 
with a cool to average temperature. Expect it to grow slowly. Let the soil 
dry out between waterings, and fertilize infrequently. The cast-iron plant 
is one of the easiest and most reliable houseplants.
 
✓ Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema): Some Chinese evergreens have dark 
green leaves marked across with white (Maria); others have yellow-
green leaves with darker splotches (Silver Queen). Both types grow into 
lush, leafy mounds. Height varies, so read plant labels. They thrive in 
average temperatures as long as they’re not exposed to cold drafts. Let 
the soil dry out between waterings. Cut back older canes to promote 
new growth from the base. Chinese evergreens are very easy to grow.
 
✓ Dracaena: Many species are available, and most are slow-growing. The 
most familiar species include Madagascar dragon tree (D. marginata), 
with long, thin leaves coming out like a fountain; corn plant (D. mas-
sangeana), common in office buildings, with tall canes sprouting wide 
leaves at the top; and D. warneckii, a large, shrubby plant with green-
and-white-striped leaves. Place these plants in an area with an average 
temperature and medium humidity. Let the soil dry out between water-
ings, and fertilize infrequently. Leaf tips and margins may turn brown 
and crispy if the plants are overwatered. Dracaenas are easy to grow.
 
✓ Mother-in-law’s tongue (Sansevieria trifasciata): This has been a 
houseplant since Neanderthal times, which explains the politically incor-
rect name. Its familiar vertical blades grow slowly to 18 inches. These 
plants thrive in cool to hot temperatures. Fertilize infrequently. Mother-
in-law’s tongue is very easy to grow.

182
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Peace lily (Spathiphyllum): Here’s the ubiquitous mall plant, and for 
good reason — its dark, glossy foliage, on 1- to 4-foot plants, looks sharp 
without too much attention. Peace lilies occasionally sport white flow-
ers. They can tolerate low humidity. Let the soil dry out slightly between 
waterings. If the soil dries too much, the plant will wilt dramatically; 
however, it will usually recover an hour or two after watering. Peace 
lilies are easy to grow.
Plants that grow in medium light
Some direct light is fine for plants that prefer medium light, but for the most 
part, they need bright but indirect light. Place them near a west or southeast 
window where they receive bright daylight but no direct sun, or in a window 
with sheer curtains. The following are well-suited for medium-light locations:
 
✓ African violet (Saintpaulia): A classic indoor plant, the African violet 
seems to bloom like crazy for a few owners and hardly at all for others. 
The fuzzy leaves on this 4- to 6-inch-tall plant form a rosette, with flow-
ers that come in white, pink, lavender, and purple. Provide an average 
to warm temperature and medium to high humidity. Keep the soil 
evenly moist. Avoid getting water on the leaves, which causes spots 
and rot. One good way to feed is to use a diluted fertilizer with every 
watering — you can choose from many foods developed especially 
for African violets. These plants are easy to grow, but getting them to 
flower can be challenging.
 
✓ Begonia: With colorful and varied foliage plus showy flowers, bego-
nias have it all. The type of begonias that have large, gorgeous flowers 
(called tuberous or Rieger begonias) are considered disposable. Enjoy 
them as long as they last, knowing that they’re unlikely to endure. 
Longer-lasting begonias include angel wing (sporting spotted leaves and 
insignificant flowers); rex begonias (with foliage that’s variegated with 
gray, purple, or magenta); and B. schmidtiana (featuring dark green crin-
kled leaves with reddish undersides). Keep the soil evenly moist, and 
avoid getting water on foliage. Fertilize lightly and regularly during the 
growing season. Repot annually. Begonias get a medium fussiness rating.
 
 If you grow bedding (wax) begonias outdoors during the summer, bring 
them in their containers indoors for the winter. Move them inside before 
the first frost, cut back leggy stems, and keep the plants in a sunny 
window.
 
✓ Bird’s nest fern (Asplenium nidus): This fern’s apple-green fronds 
unfurl to 3 feet. It thrives in areas with an average temperature and high 
humidity — a great plant for close proximity to the shower. Keep the 
soil evenly moist. Bird’s nest ferns are easy to grow.

183
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
 
✓ Boston fern (Nephrolepis exaltata Bostoniensis): Don’t overlook this 
fern just because it’s so popular. The look is tropical, full, and lush when 
well kept — but scraggly when untended. Dallas fern (N. exaltata Dallas) 
is short and dense; Fluffy Ruffles has frilly fronds. Keep the soil evenly 
moist. Boston ferns are easy to grow, but can be annoying because they 
tend to shed leaves. Shake them out occasionally to minimize daily 
sweeping up.
 
✓ Bromeliad: Sporting rosettes of sharp-edged, leathery leaves that are 
covered with grayish, waxy scales, the “flowers” of bromeliads are color-
ful bracts that remain showy for weeks. In their native habitat, these are 
epiphytes that grow on tree branches. The plant’s foliage creates a vase 
that you can fill with water. Allow the soil to dry slightly between water-
ings. Bromeliads are easy to grow.
 
✓ Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera): Its name comes from the plant’s 
bloom time, which results in abundant flowers that are pink, salmon, or 
red with bent-back petals. Related species are known as Thanksgiving 
and Easter cactus, depending on when they bloom. The fleshy, seg-
mented leaves grow in arches to form a 12-inch mound. The flowers 
and buds of Christmas cactuses knock off easily, so keep them away 
from traffic. Christmas cactuses require an extended period of cool 
(50-degree-Fahrenheit) temperatures and 12 to 14 hours of total dark-
ness at night to be coaxed into blooming. At other times, provide aver-
age to warm temperatures. Let the soil dry out between waterings, and 
give them less water in winter. They get a fussiness rating of medium.
 
✓ Coleus: Traditionally used outdoors in shady summer beds, its colorful 
foliage in reds, yellows, and oranges can brighten up your indoor space 
as well. Place in an area with high humidity. Keep the soil evenly moist 
during the growing season, and barely moist in winter. In spring, cut well 
back and repot plants. Pinch tips to keep growth bushy.
 
✓ Croton (Codiaeum variegatum): A striking plant — the colorful orange, 
yellow, or red midribs of the croton’s shiny leaves make it look like 
it was dipped in paint. Provide a medium to warm temperature, high 
humidity, and moist soil. Crotons are easy to grow.
 
✓ Dumb cane (Dieffenbachia): This is another easygoing indoor favor-
ite, with white and green variegated leaves on 3-foot-tall canes. Provide 
an average temperature and medium to high humidity. Let the soil dry 
out between waterings. When older canes become bare except for top 
leaves, you can cut them back to 3 inches. Occasionally, take a deep 
breath and cut the tallest, leggiest dumb cane stem down to 3 inches so 
that shorter stems may take over. Dumb canes are easy to grow.
 
 The plant’s name comes from the numbing effect that the sap has if 
ingested. Avoid this plant if there’s a chance that a pet or child may 
chew on it.

184
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Ivy: English ivy (Helix hedera) and related species are easy to grow and 
reliable. You can keep them pruned to a compact shape, let the vines 
trail down, or train them up and over a window. There are variegated as 
well as plain green types. Keep the soil evenly moist and watch out for 
spider mites. Ivy is easy to grow.
 
✓ Moon Valley pilea (Pilea): The leaves of this plant have dark veins and 
look finely quilted. Count on it to grow quickly. It thrives in cool to warm 
temperatures, but prefers high humidity. Let the soil dry out between 
waterings. Pinch plants back to keep them bushy. These plants are easy 
to grow.
 
✓ Moth orchid (Phaleanopsis): This is the easiest orchid, which isn’t 
saying much. Like other orchids, it can be fussy about blooming. Many 
varieties come in flower shades of pink and white. One blooming stem 
can last 18 months, which makes all the effort worthwhile. They prefer 
warm days and cool nights. Avoid overwatering, and fertilize once a 
month year-round with an orchid formula.
 
✓ Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla): This is a charming 
small tree (indoors at least), 4 to 6 feet tall, with branches in tiers — a 
good candidate for an indoor Christmas tree. Provide a cool to warm 
temperature — hot, dry conditions can cause the needles to drop. Keep 
the soil evenly moist. The Norfolk Island pine gets a medium fussiness 
rating.
 
✓ Palm: When it comes to houseplants, palms come in all sorts of shapes 
and sizes, from neanthe bella, which fits neatly on a tabletop, to date 
palm, which can reach 60 feet tall growing outdoors. In between are 
areca palm, fishtail palm, kentia palm, ponytail palm, and sago palm, 
among others. (Not all plants with palm in the common name are true 
palms, but we won’t worry about that.) Some palms are graceful and 
sway in the breeze; others have more rigid fronds and look almost 
prehistoric. Because palms vary in mature size, light and water require-
ments, and other characteristics, read plant labels carefully before you 
buy. Most palms are a little temperamental and are frequently attacked 
by spider mites, so they get a fussiness rating of medium.
 
✓ Peperomia: Widely available, peperomia forms a dense mound of 
pleated leaves. Red Ripple has deep red stems. Water when the soil is 
dry. Peperomias are easy to grow.
 
✓ Philodendron: Choose from a wide variety of plants to suit any taste — 
cutleaf, purplestem, and elephant ear are a few possibilities. These 
plants become vines unless you pinch them back. They’re popular 
houseplants for good reason: They’re among the easiest to grow and 
most reliable.
 
✓ Pothos (Epipremnum): This vining plant grows and grows, making it the 
plant of choice for training up and over your windows or anything else 
that will stay still. It can also be kept shrubby with frequent pruning. 

185
 Chapter 14: Indoor Container Gardening
The leaves are usually variegated with splashes of creamy yellow. Let 
the soil dry out between waterings. Pothos is very easy to grow.
 
✓ Spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum): The spider plant is a fine 
choice for a hanging basket. Vittatum, with variegated foliage, is the 
most common. Provide cool to average temperatures. Let the soil dry 
out between waterings. Repot when roots fill the pot. You can grow 
more plants by rooting spiderlets (the miniature plants extending off the 
mother plant) in soil or water. Note that fluoride in tap water can cause 
the leaf tips to turn brown.
 
✓ Umbrella plant (Schefflera actinophylla): An imposing 6 to 8 feet at 
maturity, the umbrella plant is a good choice for a big, empty corner. 
Keep the soil evenly moist (drier in winter). Repot every two years.
Plants that need lots of light
To stay in top condition, sun-lovers need a south or west window exposure 
and direct light much of the day. Plants that require a lot of light include
 
✓ Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis): Long, succulent spikes grow from the 
center of the plant. The gel inside the leaves is used to relieve minor 
skin irritations. Aloe vera is slow-growing, but undemanding with regard 
to temperature and water. Allow soil to dry out between waterings. 
Divide offsets, and pot them up for new plants.
 
✓ Ficus: A large class of plants that includes fig trees, rubber plants, fiddle-
leaved figs, and creeping figs, ficus plants are similar in that they all 
have a milky sap that can be irritating to skin. Plant in regular potting 
soil and keep the soil slightly moist — avoid overwatering. Most types 
do best in bright, indirect light, warm temperatures, and medium humid-
ity. Ficus is easy to grow.
 
✓ Hibiscus: These tropical plants are known for their shiny foliage and 
huge, saucer-shaped flowers. Left on their own, they’ll grow into a 
shrubby tree. You can keep them small with regular pruning, or train 
them to a standard (single-trunk tree). Provide rich, moist soil and 
bright, indirect light. Because they can be temperamental when it comes 
to flowering and are often attacked by aphids and whiteflies, they get a 
medium rating for fussiness.
 
✓ Meyer’s lemon: In addition to fruit (which is far from a sure thing 
indoors), this small tree produces glossy leaves and fragrant flowers. 
Put the plant outside in summer. Indoors, provide average to cool tem-
peratures. The tree may need supplemental light in winter. Keep the 
soil evenly moist. Growth is slow; don’t repot too often. Lemon trees 
are prone to scale insect pests, need consistent fertilizing, and may 
require hand-pollination for fruit set, making them a medium on the 
fussiness scale.

186
Part III: In It for the Long Haul: Permanent Plantings 
 
✓ Polka-dot plant (Hypoestes phyllostachya): This plant is best 
described as perky, with dark green leaves speckled with pink. It grows 
quickly. Keep the soil evenly moist. Cut plants back to keep them small 
and bushy. Polka-dot plants are easy to grow.
Growing Edibles Indoors
If you have a sunny windowsill, you can grow a few herbs and perhaps a let-
tuce plant or two. Edible plants like these that are grown for their foliage are 
the easiest to grow indoors. Purchase small plants or start them from seed. 
Refer to Chapter 5 for step-by-step planting instructions and Chapter 8 for 
more on growing lettuce and herbs.
If you want to venture further into the edible plant kingdom, you probably 
need to provide supplemental light, especially in winter. Plants grown for their 
fruit, like tomatoes and peppers (yes, these are, botanically speaking, fruits), 
require full sun, or the artificial equivalent, to produce flowers and set fruit.
When it comes to providing indoor supplemental lighting, incandescent light 
bulbs (the bulbs typically used in households) emit too much heat to be very 
useful. The light tends to be too much on the red end of the spectrum for 
healthy plant growth. You have a couple options:
 
✓ Fluorescent lights: Cooler and more efficient than incandescent lights, 
these are commonly used for seed-starting. Regular “cool white” fluo-
rescent lights, which produce light on the blue end of the spectrum, are 
fine if you’re growing plants for their foliage. If you want to grow plants 
that produce flowers and fruits, look for full-spectrum lights, which pro-
vide a balance of light across the spectrum. However, even full-spectrum 
fluorescent lights aren’t bright enough to grow healthy, vigorous fruiting 
plants. But you may be able to harvest a tomato or two.
 
✓ HID (High Intensity Discharge) lights: These are the most efficient 
when it comes to converting electricity into light and they are the lights 
of choice for professional growers and serious hobbyists. The bulbs are 
very bright and draw a lot of electricity, which can tax home electrical 
systems. HID bulbs are expensive, but they also last longer than fluores-
cents. If you want to grow tomatoes and other fruiting plants indoors in 
winter, they may be worth the investment.
You can also purchase self-contained growing systems that include lights 
suspended over special containers, and hydroponic units in which plants are 
constantly bathed in a nutrient solution. These systems are expensive for the 
amount of food you’re likely to grow, but if you want to garden year-round, 
they may be worth it to you.

▶ Conserving the precious resource of water
P
lants growing in containers are at your mercy when it comes to getting 
the right amount of water. Unlike plants growing in the ground that can 
rely on deep roots to get them through dry spells, container-grown plants 
have limited soil from which to draw. When they dry out, they really dry out. 
On the other hand, if container-grown plants are left to sit too long in saucers 
full of water, the roots can die from lack of oxygen. The repercussions of 
becoming parched or waterlogged are usually more severe and permanent 
than if the plants were in the ground.
It comes down to this: If you want to be successful growing plants in contain-
ers, that is, if you want your flowers to bloom well and your fruits, herbs, and 
vegetables to produce a bountiful harvest, you have to be an attentive and 
efficient waterer. In this chapter, we show you how.
Accounting for Various Factors 
in the Watering Equation
Beginning gardeners often ask, “How often should I water my plants?” 
Unfortunately, there’s no simple answer. How often container plants need 
water and how much they need at any given time depend on several factors. 
We address these in the following sections.

190
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
When you choose plants and containers for different sites, consider the effect 
they’ll have on your watering chores. Do you really want to lug a 2-gallon 
watering can to the far edge of your backyard to water a porous container 
filled with moisture-loving plants? Place higher-maintenance plants closer to 
water sources, and you’ll be more likely to tend to them properly.
Considering location
Just because a plant lives outside doesn’t mean it benefits from Mother 
Nature’s rain showers. Plants growing under eaves or beneath a dense tree 
canopy may be deprived of rain. Stand next to the container and look up. Can 
you see the sky? If not, plants in that container will get little or no water from 
Mother Nature, so you’ll need to quench their thirst. Obviously, plants grow-
ing on a covered porch or beneath an awning must receive all their water 
from you because they’re not out in the rain.
Containers placed in full sun almost always need more frequent watering 
than those in shady areas. That’s pretty obvious, but other contributing fac-
tors are more subtle. For example, containers situated on a hot surface like a 
concrete patio are likely to dry out faster than those on a wood deck, which 
tends to stay cooler. Plants near a light-colored, south-facing wall, which 
reflects light and heat, dry out faster than those farther away.
Contemplating climate and weather
Climate is determined by the average weather where you live on a season-to-
season, year-to-year basis. If you live in an area like Seattle, Washington, or 
Biloxi, Mississippi, where the air is humid and rainfall is regular and reliable, 
watering isn’t a constant chore, except in prolonged dry spells or periods 
of drought. In drier, hotter areas like Los Angeles, California, and Phoenix, 
Arizona, you may need to squeeze watering container plants into your sched-
ule on a daily, or even twice-daily, basis.
Weather is what’s happening outside right now, and it’s up to you to pay 
attention. Hot winds on a cloudless day can dry out a plant growing in a hang-
ing basket or a clay pot in a matter of minutes. Heavy rains saturate plants 
and fill the saucers underneath them.
Table 15-1 tells you in a nutshell how to adjust watering according to weather 
conditions. You may also find it helpful to think about how you feel — and 
how much water you’re inclined to drink — in different weather conditions. If 
you’re frequently thirsty, chances are your plants are, too.

Evaluating pot type and color
The porosity of a container influences how much water evaporates through 
its sides — and that can be a lot. At one extreme are hanging baskets lined 
with sphagnum moss, which seem to dry out as soon as you turn your back 
on them in hot weather. At the other end of the spectrum are plastic pots, 
glazed ceramic, metal, and thick concrete containers that hardly lose any 
moisture through their sides. In the middle are unglazed clay pots, which are 
pretty porous and dry out quickly, and wooden containers, which dry out 
slower but may lose water through their sides.
The container’s color also affects how quickly plants dry out. Lighter-colored 
containers reflect more sunlight and dry out more slowly than darker-colored 
ones, which absorb heat.
Seeing the impact of soil variations
Most potting soils used in containers are formulated for good drainage, 
which means they dry out fairly quickly. But some dry out faster than others. 
For example, potting soils that are higher in organic materials like peat moss 
or compost can hold more water than those that contain a higher percentage 
of mineral components like sand or perlite. You can find out more about pot-
ting soils in Chapter 4.
Regarding root-boundedness
Is that a word? Even if it isn’t, the term means a lot to anyone who grows 
plants in pots. As a plant grows in a container, the roots become more and 
more crowded, which affects how much water the plant needs.

192
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
At first, the roots of a recent transplant may not even fill the pot, so the 
plant’s drinking system may not be able to absorb all the water in the soil. At 
this stage it’s easy to overwater plants. Over time, roots grow throughout the 
potting mix and are able to use the reservoir of water it contains.
Eventually, as plant roots continue to grow and the organic matter in the pot-
ting mix begins to break down, the pot contains more roots than soil. When 
this happens, the plant is root-bound and the root ball (roots and soil) can 
be difficult to keep moist. You can either vow to be extra attentive to the 
plant’s water needs, or transplant it into a larger pot. For help doing that, see 
Chapter 17.
Observing genetic disposition
Different species of plants are adapted to different growing environments — 
picture the Brazilian rainforest and the Mohave Desert. Most of the plants 
we commonly grow in containers need consistently moist soil to thrive, but 
some plants thrive in drier conditions than others. For example, if you let a 
pot full of lettuce go dry, the leaves will lose moisture and probably won’t 
ever completely recover — you may as well replant. Cactuses and succulents, 
on the other hand, tolerate dry spells quite well; in fact, most prefer to be on 
the dry side. If they get too much water, many cactuses and succulents rot.
 
Xeriscaping is a term used to describe gardening with water-thrifty plants. If 
water is expensive or scarce in your region, or you just want to minimize your 
watering chores, choose plants listed as good for xeriscaping for your con-
tainer gardens. However, even these plants will still need watering.
Water Ways: Methods for Watering 
Container Plants
You can always use a good, old-fashioned watering can to water your plants. 
However, there are tools and techniques that make the job easier. For exam-
ple, if you have lots of containers or aren’t always available to water daily, 
timesaving techniques take on greater importance. If you live in a region 
where water is scarce, every drop is precious — and expensive — so water 
conservation is a focus. If plant diseases are common in your area, keeping 
water off the plant leaves and applying it only to the soil is key. (If a disease 
does strike your plants, flip to Chapter 18 for help in dealing with it.) The fol-
lowing sections describe different tools and techniques you can use to apply 
water to containers, including their benefits and drawbacks.

193
 Chapter 15: Quenching Your Plants’ Thirst
Watering by hand
Probably the most commonly used method, hand watering allows you to 
easily adjust how much water each pot gets according to its size and specific 
needs. For indoor watering, using one of the many handheld watering cans 
on the market is generally easiest, but little hose setups that can be hooked 
to the sink faucet are also available. Outdoors, most gardeners simply drag 
hoses around to water their pots.
Many excellent types of hose-end attachments let you turn the water on and 
off without going all the way back to the faucet. Bubbler attachments soften 
the output of the water, which can prevent washing soil mix out of the con-
tainer. You can even purchase extensions that make it easier to water hang-
ing pots (see Figure 15-1).
 
Whatever you do, don’t let the hose run so forcefully into the container that it 
washes out soil; soften the water stream with your hand, at least.

Setting up sprinklers
Although lawn sprinklers are available in a variety of styles, they’re not very 
efficient for watering containers — too much water is wasted. In a pinch, you 
may set up a sprinkler to water a raised bed or a grouping of containers, but 
if you find this becomes a habit, you’re better off putting in a drip system, as 
we describe in the next section.
 
One problem with overhead watering, whether from a hose, watering can, or 
sprinkler, is that it can encourage the spread of disease. Most plant diseases 
are caused by fungi, which need a film of water in order to spread. Wet foliage 
provides an ideal breeding ground, especially in humid climates where leaf 
surfaces dry slowly. In such areas, either install a drip system or apply water 
directly to the soil to avoid moistening foliage or flowers.
Installing drip irrigation
Drip irrigation is a very effective and efficient way to water containers. A drip 
system provides water slowly through holes, or emitters, in a black plastic 
pipe. You connect the pipe to a water supply, install a filter and often a pres-
sure regulator, and then place emitters in each container. When you turn on 
the water, it drips slowly from the emitters, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Emitters differ in terms of how much water they put out per minute: 1⁄2 gallon 
per hour, 1 gallon per hour, and so on. Drip systems usually have to run at 
least several hours to wet a large area, such as a raised bed. In smaller pots, 
emitters may only need to be run for an hour, depending on their output. 
Larger pots may need more than one emitter. Watch your system carefully 
the first few times that you water. Poke around in the soil to see how long 
you need to water to wet a container, or how long it takes before water runs 
out the drainage holes. Then make adjustments accordingly.
Drip irrigation systems hooked to automatic timers can really relieve the 
chore of watering a lot of containers. And although you may be hard-pressed 
to imagine weaving plastic pipe all over your porch or patio without creating 
a messy nightmare, rest assured that all it takes is a little creative thinking. 
You can bury some piping or run piping above your plants, along eaves.
 
If you live in an area where the soil freezes, don’t leave your drip system out-
side in winter. Your pipes may burst. Instead, drain out the water, roll up the 
piping, and store it in the garage.

195

system.
 
Drip irrigation systems are sold in many garden centers and big box stores. 
You can also purchase them through the mail (see the appendix). Pressure-
compensating emitters apply water consistently from one end of the line to 
the other, regardless of pressure changes due to uneven ground.
 
Cousins of drip irrigation, soaker hoses are porous and release water along 
their entire length. However, they can release it unevenly, with less and less 
water released as you get farther from the spigot. Also, if the soil surface on 
which soaker hoses lay is uneven, the hoses apply water unevenly. But they 
can still be useful in level, raised beds.
Relying on self-watering pots
Self-watering pots include a water reservoir, usually in the walls or base 
of the container, which is connected to the root ball of the plant through 
a small wick (like those you see in Tiki torches). As the root ball dries out, 

196
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
the wick sucks up water from the reservoir and supplies it to the root ball, 
keeping it nice and moist. Flip back to Chapter 3 for an illustration of a self-
watering pot.
 
Be careful with self-watering pots. In hot weather the reservoir can run dry in 
a day or two. Self-watering pots can also keep some plants too wet, causing 
them to rot and die. And because there’s no way to leach the salts from a self-
watering pot, salt burn can develop. For information on curing salt burn 
(which isn’t easy), see Chapter 18.
Figuring Out How Often to Water
Plants’ water needs vary with the weather and the seasons — plants need 
less water in cool weather, more in warm weather, and so on. Thus, even an 
automated system requires adjustment so that it waters less in spring and 
more in summer. Because we can’t come to your house and give you a pre-
cise watering schedule for your specific situation, we advise you to practice 
your powers of observation and make watering adjustments accordingly.
You can also take advantage of these other ways to tell when your plants 
need water or when containers are getting dry:
 
✓ Pay attention to what your plants tell you. That’s right, plants can com-
municate with you. When plants start to dry out, the leaves droop and 
wilt. The plant may also lose its bright, glossy, green color and start to 
look a little drab. Make it your goal to water before a plant reaches that 
point (consider it a cry for help).
 
✓ Dig in the ground. Stick your finger an inch or two into the soil in the 
top of a pot. If the soil feels dry, it may be time to water. For small con-
tainers, you can carefully slip the root ball out of the pot to see whether 
it’s moist.
 
✓ Lift the pot. As soil dries out, it gets lighter. Compare how heavy a pot 
is right after watering thoroughly with how it feels a few days later. By 
simply tilting a pot on its edge and judging its weight, you eventually 
figure out how to tell when it’s dry or getting close to it.
 
✓ Use a moisture sensor. Nurseries sell various devices for reading soil 
moisture. Most have a long, needlelike rod connected to a meter. You 
push the rod into the soil, and the meter tells you how wet the soil is. 
These sensors can be pretty handy, but don’t trust them too much right 
off the bat. Some can be thrown off by salts in the soil. To start, see how 
their readings compare to what you discover by feeling the soil and lift-
ing the pot. Then make any necessary adjustments.
By taking these various factors into consideration, you’ll eventually get a 
sense of how often each container needs water.

197
 Chapter 15: Quenching Your Plants’ Thirst
Not Too Much, Not Too Little: Applying 
Just the Right Amount of H2O
When you water a container plant, the goal is to moisten the entire root 
ball and apply just enough water so that some drains out the bottom. Now, 
if the container is properly planted, a space exists between the top of the 
soil and the container’s rim that you can fill with water. It may be anywhere 
from 1 inch in small containers to 4 or 5 inches in larger ones. But whatever 
the case, you have to fill it more than once to get enough water to wet the 
root ball. That means filling the pot once, letting the water soak in, and then 
repeating the process until the whole root ball is moist.
This whole soaking process is a bit tricky for one reason. As the root ball in 
a container dries, it shrinks, usually pulling away from the edges of the pot. 
So when you water the first time, the water drains down the edges without 
reaching the root ball at all. This phenomenon explains why you need to 
make several passes with the hose or watering can — so that the root ball 
swells up a bit and seals the edges of the container, at which point the water 
can soak in. This is also why you can never judge how wet a root ball is by 
the amount of water that comes out the drainage hole. You may be fooled 
every time. Check water penetration by lifting the edge of the pot or poking in 
a finger, as we describe earlier.
 
The fact that drainage holes may fool you doesn’t mean you should do away 
with them. Without them, the plant drowns. Periodically check the drainage 
when you water. Even if your containers have holes in the bottom, they may 
fill up with roots, preventing proper drainage. Cut the holes open with a knife 
if necessary.
You can wet shrunken root balls or plants that are really root-bound in a few 
other ways:
 
✓ Water from the bottom. If you place small trays or saucers underneath 
your pots to catch excess water, that water is gradually reabsorbed by 
a dry root ball. You’re basically watering from the bottom, at a pace dic-
tated by the plant.
 
 It’s not a good idea to have a container sitting in water for a long time. 
The root ball becomes too wet and eventually the plant drowns. But 
submerging a pot partially, or even completely, for just a little while 
doesn’t hurt, and it’s a great way to wet a really dry root ball. In fact, if 
your plants get too dry, set them in a container filled with several inches 
of warm water — use the kitchen sink, a 5-gallon bucket, or your child’s 
swimming pool, whatever’s easiest. Let the pots bathe for an hour or so; 
then remove the plants and let the excess water drain off.
 
✓ Use drip irrigation. Drip emitters apply water at a slow, steady rate and 
do a great job of thoroughly wetting the root ball.

198
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
Water plants deeply and thoroughly; then allow them to dry out a bit before 
watering again. Avoid frequent light sprinklings, which encourage roots to 
form near the soil surface where they’re prone to drying out. Deep but less 
frequent watering encourages healthy, deep roots.
Being Water Wise: Strategies 
to Save Water
Water shortages are a reality in almost any climate or region at one time or 
another, and container plants use a lot of water — more than the same plants 
in the ground. Here are a few things you can do when water is scarce or 
limited, when you want to conserve the precious resource of fresh water, or 
when you just want to ease your watering chores:
 
✓ Install drip irrigation. It applies water slowly without runoff. Drip irriga-
tion is definitely the most frugal watering system that you can use.
 
✓ Double-pot. If you take a small pot and put it in a bigger pot, you reduce 
the amount of sunlight that hits the sides of the smaller pot, which helps 
cool the soil. Cooler soil means less water is needed.
 
✓ Use soil polymers. Soil polymers are weird, gelatin-like materials that 
hold hundreds of times their weight in water. If you mix them dry with 
your soil before you plant, you can stretch the time between waterings. 
Follow the label directions carefully, because a little goes a long way.
 
✓ Transplant. Moving a root-bound plant into a bigger container, where 
it has more soil to draw water from, can greatly reduce your watering 
chores. Better yet, if a container plant is really too much trouble to 
water, maybe you’re better off planting it in the ground.
 
✓ Move pots into the shade. If the weather gets really hot, move your pots 
into the shade to cool them down and reduce water usage. A few days of 
less sun won’t hurt them. Some sun-loving plants thrive on getting only 
morning sun in the hottest part of summer.
 
✓ Group pots. If you put pots close together, they can shade each other 
and the amount of sun that hits their sides is reduced.
 
✓ Bury the pots. Huh? That’s right, just dig a hole and bury the pots just 
deep enough so that the rims are covered. Or, you can build a wooden 
box, put the pots in it, and fill it in around the edges with potting soil or 
organic material like peat moss or ground bark. You still have to water, 
but you use a lot less, especially if you also wet the soil around the pots. 
This method is drastic, but if water is really tight or you’re going out of 
town for a while, it works.

199
 Chapter 15: Quenching Your Plants’ Thirst
 
✓ Mulch. A mulch is a layer of organic matter that’s spread over the soil 
surface around a plant. Several inches of heavy mulch, like large pieces 
of bark (so that they don’t float away when you water) or other material, 
can cool the soil and reduce evaporation, thus saving water.
 
✓ Pull weeds. Weeds steal water meant for container plants, so keep them 
pulled.
 
✓ Water efficiently. Do as we suggest earlier in this chapter, and wet the 
entire root ball. You’ll have happier and healthier plants, and use less 
water in the long run.
 
✓ Use rainwater. Put a barrel or other collector where the drain pipes 
from your roof empty. Then use that water on your flowers.
 
✓ Measure rainfall. Keep track of how much rain you get. An inch is usu-
ally enough to let you skip a watering for plants that are out in the open. 
You can buy fancy rain gauges, or just set out an empty tuna fish can. If 
it overflows, you’ve received more than an inch of rain.
 
✓ Choose plants that aren’t very thirsty. Some cactuses and succulents 
can get by on little water, even when grown in containers. Look for 
plants described as drought-tolerant or good for xeriscaping. These 
plants will still need regular watering but not as much or as often as 
thirstier species.
Seeing that Your Plants Get 
Water When You’re Away
So you’re going on vacation and can’t find anyone to water your plants. What 
are you going to do? Start by considering some of the water-saving methods 
described in the preceding section, especially burying the pots or setting 
up a drip system with an automatic timer. The following sections provide a 
couple other solutions.
Wicking water
Choosing to wick water is kind of like building your own self-watering pot 
(see the section “Relying on self-watering pots” earlier in this chapter) and 
works best on smaller containers, especially houseplants. Go to a hardware 
store and buy some long wicks like those used for Tiki torches (for really 
small pots, you can use thick cotton string). Wet the wick and use a pencil to 
push it a few inches into the wet root ball of the plant. Stick the other end in 
a bowl or glass of water. As the root ball dries, it sucks water from the bowl 
through the wick, keeping it wet.

200
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
Don’t try this the day you’re getting ready to leave. Set it up a week in advance 
to make sure it works and to see how much of a water reservoir you need. If 
you use a big bucket to hold the water, you can water several plants at once.
Using soil polymers
Buy some soil polymers (see the section “Being Water Wise: Strategies to 
Save Water”) at your local nursery, put some in a small plastic cup, and add 
water to turn them to gelatin. Turn the cup upside down on top of the soil 
in your pot. Over time, the polymers slowly release their moisture to water 
the plant. As with water wicks, don’t wait until the day you leave to try this 
method. Test it a week or so before you go away to see how fast the water is 
released and how much polymer you need to use.
 
You may be able to buy a product that already has ready-to-use, hydrated 
polymers in a cup. You just flip it over on top of the soil in your pot. See 
whether your nursery has it in stock.
Implementing ingenious devices
You’ve probably seen them advertised on television — those funny, elon-
gated glass bulbs that you fill with water, turn upside down, and plunge into 
the soil. They drain water slowly as the plant needs it, so you don’t have to 
water as often. These Aqua Globes are handy for all types of containers, not 
just houseplants. Use several of them in larger containers to provide water 
while you’re out of town.
 
You can create your own self-watering device by filling a 1-liter plastic soda 
bottle with water, then poking a few holes in the cap and replacing it. Place the 
bottle upside-down in the container, burying the top of the bottle in the soil so 
the water can drain slowly through the holes. It isn’t as pretty as a fancy glass 
bulb, but it gets the job done.

T
hinking of your container plants as pets is understandable — after all, 
plants and pets are living things that provide you with amusement, com-
panionship, and even an occasional gift of shedding (fortunately, hairballs 
aren’t important to this discussion). In return for what your pets/plants do 
for you, you have certain obligations, with feeding right near the top. Your 
plants depend on you in much the same way that your border collie Max does. 
Generations ago, Max lost the ability to go out and forage for himself. Likewise, 
container plants can’t send roots down deep and outward in the ground the 
way garden plants can. Plants grown in the cushy but confined environment 
that you create for them must search for nutrients within their own boundaries.
In this chapter, you find out why plants need nutrients along with general 
information on how you can fill those requirements. For details specific to 
certain types of plants (annuals, perennials, and so on), refer to the chapters 
in Parts II and III.
Knowing Your Plants’ Nutritional Needs
Although fun, drawing an analogy between feeding your plants and feeding 
your pets isn’t quite accurate. Through photosynthesis, plants manufacture 
their own food (we’ve never seen a dog do that). In fact, all life on earth relies 
on this phenomenon by which plants, using the energy of the sun, convert 
water and air into sugars — the “food” they burn for energy to live and grow. 
In the process, they consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen. (Every 

202
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
once in a while, take a deep breath and give thanks to plants across the globe 
for providing us with oxygen and sugar. And chocolate. And coffee. And even 
prime rib, because cattle eat plants.) So when you say you’re feeding your 
plants, that’s not exactly what you’re doing; rather, you’re fertilizing them — 
supplying them with certain nutrients they need to thrive. Think of fertilizer 
as akin to the vitamins we take.
Plants absorb most of their nutrients from the soil — specifically, the soil 
solution, which is the moisture contained in the spaces between soil parti-
cles. If any nutrients are lacking or are present only in forms that plants can’t 
absorb, plants won’t grow to their full potential. Plants growing in the ground 
have far-ranging roots that seek out what the plants need. Plants whose roots 
are confined to containers rely on you to provide a consistent supply of nutri-
ents. (Refer to Chapter 4 for details about how soil supports plant growth.)
For healthy growth, plants need 16 different elements. Carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen — the foundation blocks for photosynthesis — are required in large 
quantities. Plants get these from air and water. Plants also need relatively 
large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These elements are 
called primary nutrients, and they form the basis for most fertilizers. Table 
16-1 gives you a rundown of the roles they play, as well as signs that a plant 
is lacking a particular nutrient.

Secondary nutrients — calcium, magnesium, and sulfur — are required in 
smaller quantities. While they’re usually present in sufficient quantities in 
garden soil, they may be lacking in soil-less mixes, especially those that con-
tain few ingredients.
The micronutrients — you guessed it — are needed in even smaller amounts. 
They include iron, manganese, copper, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, and 
zinc, and perhaps others — researchers are still studying the nuances of 
plant nutrition. Like secondary nutrients, micronutrients may be lacking in 
soil-less mixes.
Figuring Out the Finer Points of Fertilizer
At first glance, a nursery shelf lined with fertilizers is a bewildering sight. But 
confusion doesn’t have to crowd your senses. When you know what nutrients 
your plants need and what type of fertilizer you prefer, you can choose the 
fertilizer that’s best for you.
A fertilizer’s guaranteed analysis (the amount of nitrogen, phosphate, and 
potassium) is one of the most important guidelines for choosing the right 
fertilizer, but there are other considerations, too. For example, do you want 
all-natural fertilizer, or are you willing to use a fertilizer that was made syn-
thetically? Should the nutrients be released quickly or over a longer period of 
time? And would you rather apply it in liquid form or solid form? The follow-
ing sections give you insights into these choices.
Decoding the numbers on the label
 
When you buy a commercial fertilizer, the guaranteed analysis is listed on the 
label with three numbers. These three numbers tell you how much of each of 
the primary nutrients is in the fertilizer. The first number indicates the per-
centage of nitrogen; the second, the percentage of phosphate; and the third, 
the percentage of potassium, also known as potash. A 10-5-5 fertilizer is 10 per-
cent nitrogen, 5 percent phosphate, and 5 percent potash by weight.
Do the math, and you find that a 100-pound bag of 10-5-5 fertilizer contains 
10 pounds of nitrogen, 5 pounds of phosphorus, and 5 pounds of potash — 
a total of 20 pounds of usable nutrients. Although the remaining 80 pounds 
contain some useful nutrients (also listed on the label), most of the balance 
is either filler or carrier left over from manufacturing.

204
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Debating organic versus synthetic
Most organic fertilizers derive their nutrients from plants, animals, or miner-
als. Synthetic or chemical fertilizers are manufactured from mineral salts. Is 
one better than the other? That question is the subject of countless debates 
and philosophical face-offs. Some gardeners believe organic is better — for 
their health and the health of the planet. Others say, hey, the plants don’t 
know where their nitrogen is coming from. Here we (briefly) give you an over-
view on each, and leave the philosophical wrangling up to you.
Organic fertilizers usually contain familiar-sounding materials, such as fish 
emulsion and kelp (seaweed). They may also contain various composted 
animal manures, including cow, poultry, and horse manure, as well as 
slaughterhouse by-products such as bone, blood, and feather meal. Some 
fertilizers even contain added beneficial microbes. Individual ingredients 
may contain limited nutrients; for example, fish emulsion contains mostly 
nitrogen; bone meal mostly phosphorus. But many organic fertilizer for-
mulas contain a wide range of nutrients, especially the micronutrients that 
may be lacking in synthetic formulas.
 
If you want to be sure you’re using a product appropriate for organic grow-
ing, look for the term OMRI-Listed on the label. The Organic Materials Review 
Institute (OMRI) is a nonprofit that evaluates products to see whether or not 
they conform to the standards established by the National Organic Program. If 
the label says OMRI-Listed, the product has been approved for use in certified 
organic farming.
Synthetic or chemical fertilizers are manufactured from mineral salts and 
usually have higher N-P-K ratings than organic ones. Sold as ready-to-apply or 
in concentrates requiring dilution, they are sterile and provide a precise dose 
of nutrients. They’re usually relatively inexpensive.
Table 16-2 provides a rundown of some benefits and drawbacks to organic 
and synthetic fertilizers.

ecules; less likely to be leached from soil

washed away during watering
Unlikely to burn plant roots
Improperly diluted soluble fertilizers 
can “burn” plant roots due to high salt 
concentrations
Using fast-release versus slow-release
The nutrients in some fertilizers are ready for plants to use immediately after 
you apply them. These fertilizers are dubbed fast-release. In other fertilizers, 
the nutrients are released slowly over time, earning the descriptor slow-
release (creative, we know).
If plants are in need of a quick pick-me-up, a fast-release formula may be in 
order. Fast-release synthetic fertilizers, such as Miracle-Gro, are used by 
plants right away; however, any fertilizer not used may be washed away in 
the next watering.
 
Most fast-release synthetic fertilizers must be mixed with water before using. 
Improperly diluted, they can “burn” plants, because they’re derived from 
mineral salts that can leach moisture from plant roots, harming or even killing 
them. Diluting and applying fertilizers according to the directions on the label 
is critical.
Slow-release fertilizers provide nutrients to plants over time under particular 
conditions and are often best added to the soil mix at planting time. For exam-
ple, Osmocote, a synthetic fertilizer formulated into small beads, releases 
nutrients in response to soil moisture. Different forms of these slow-release 
synthetic fertilizers are often added to commercial soil mixes. Check out 
Chapter 4 for more on soil mixes.
 
Overall, organic fertilizers tend to be relatively slow-release because the nutri-
ents are bound up in complex molecules that break down slowly into plant 
nutrients. However, some act faster than others. For example, a fish-emulsion/
seaweed mix provides some nutrients right away.
 
Container-grown plants often fare best with a combination of the two types of 
fertilizer. Even if you’ve added a slow-release product to the soil mix, watch 
your container plants carefully. If plants grow slowly or are a bit yellowish 
even on a diet of slow-release fertilizer, give them a boost with an application 
of a fast-release formula, especially one containing nitrogen, such as soluble 
10-10-10 or fish emulsion.

206
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Understanding fertilizer formulations
Most fertilizers are sold either in granular or liquid form.
 
✓ Granular fertilizers are available in bags or boxes. Slow-release types 
are usually best added to the growing mix prior to planting, although 
some can be scattered on the soil surface to dissolve slowly. Fast-
release types are usually mixed with water and applied when you irri-
gate. Follow label directions for application rates and methods.
 
✓ Liquid fertilizers are available in bottles or jugs. On a per-nutrient basis, 
most liquid fertilizers are more expensive than granular ones. Most 
liquid fertilizers need to be diluted in water before you apply them, but 
some are ready to use. Liquid fertilizers are applied when you water and 
can be injected into irrigation systems, which is the reason many profes-
sional growers prefer them. Some liquid fertilizers are sold in hose-end 
applicators that eliminate the need for mixing.
 
Liquids are particularly well-suited for plants grown in containers.
Organic growing in containers 
versus in the ground
As more people turn to organic growing in their 
gardens, it’s natural that they want to do so for 
their container plants, too. However, there are 
some important differences between grow-
ing organically in the ground and doing so in 
containers.
Organic gardeners “feed the soil, so the soil 
can feed the plants.” In the garden, adding 
lots of organic matter like compost promotes 
a healthy soil ecosystem filled with beneficial 
microbes, insects, and earthworms. This soil 
life breaks down organic matter slowly, releas-
ing it to plants as they need it. If their soil is rich 
and healthy, organic gardeners may not need 
to apply additional fertilizer during the growing 
season.
However, soil in the confines of a container 
can’t support such a diverse ecosystem. So 
even if you start off with a mix containing lots of 
organic matter, you’ll likely need to apply addi-
tional nutrients throughout the growing season. 
However, you can still grow plants organically if 
you use organic fertilizers. (You can find infor-
mation about how organic matter improves soil 
structure and nutrient levels in Chapter 4.)

 Chapter 16: Food for Thought: Fertilizing Your Plants
Becoming familiar with fertilizer lingo
Before you venture off to ring up your newfound fertilizer knowledge, con-
sider a few more fertilizer phrases that may come in handy:
 
✓ Complete fertilizers contain all three primary nutrients — nitrogen (N), 
phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The term “complete” is linked more 
to fertilizer industry laws and regulations than to satisfaction of the 
plant’s actual requirements for nutrients.
 
✓ An incomplete fertilizer is missing one or more of the major nutrients, 
usually the P or the K. Fish emulsion, which usually has a guaranteed 
analysis of 5-0-0, is an incomplete fertilizer. Incomplete is not necessar-
ily bad. In fact, less is sometimes good enough. Incomplete fertilizers 
are usually less expensive; if your soil has plenty of P and K, why apply 
more? Too much can harm your plants.
 
✓ Chelated micronutrients are in a form that allows them to be absorbed 
into a plant quicker than the more commonly available sulfated forms. 
If your plants just won’t green up (they stay mottled yellow and green, 
or just plain yellow), no matter how much nitrogen you apply, you 
probably have a micronutrient deficiency of iron, zinc, or manganese. 
Chelated micronutrients are the quickest fix, although you may also 
have a soil pH problem that’s preventing the nutrients from being 
absorbed by the plant (see Chapter 4 for more information on pH).
 
✓ Foliar fertilizers are applied to the leaves of plants rather than to the 
roots. Leaves aren’t as effective as roots at taking up nutrients, but they 
do absorb quickly — so foliar feeding is a good, fast feed. Most liquid 
fertilizers, including seaweed/fish emulsion, can be used as foliar fertil-
izers, but make sure that the label instructs you accordingly. Don’t apply 
fertilizers in hot weather because they may burn the leaves.
 
✓ Specialty fertilizers are supposedly formulated for specific types of 
plants. For example, you may find a fertilizer labeled flower food with an 
analysis of 0-10-10. The logic behind such a fertilizer is that a blooming 
plant needs more P and K than it does N. That’s because the P and K are 
important in the formation of flowers, and the N promotes leaves. And 
you want flowers, right? Well, not so fast. Remember that P and K don’t 
move into the soil as well as N does. So you can apply all the P and K 
you want, and these major nutrients may not get to the roots. Besides, if 
you’re using a good potting mix, your plants probably have plenty of P 
and K already.
 
 Truth be told, we think specialty fertilizers are more marketing strategy 
than high-tech solution — and more expense than can be expected with 
other fertilizers.

208
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Preparing a Balanced Fertilizing Plan
If you’ve read this far, you really know your fertilizers now. The next step is 
to formulate a plan for fertilizing your container plants.
 
Plants growing in containers need more water than those growing in the 
ground. The more you water, the more you flush nutrients from the soil, and 
the more often you have to fertilize.
 
You can offset some of this constant loss of nutrients by mixing slow-release 
fertilizers into the soil mix before planting. But some gardeners prefer the less-
food-more-often approach. In other words, plants are given a little liquid fertil-
izer every time, or every other time, that they’re watered. Cut the 
recommended rates on the bottle of fertilizer in half or into quarters.
If frequent feeding poses too much hassle for you, use a water-soluble fertil-
izer once every week or two. Follow the rates recommended on the label. 
Your container plants can still respond well.
 
Overfertilizing can be much worse than not applying enough nutrients. Excess 
nitrogen, for example, can burn the edges of leaves and even kill a plant. 
Besides that, if you apply too much, fertilizer can leach from containers and 
run off into storm sewers and groundwater, and then you’re a nasty polluter. 
Always follow label instructions to the letter.
Also, don’t apply fertilizer to dry plants or during extremely hot or windy 
weather conditions, because doing so can burn your container garden. 
Fertilize only actively growing plants. Adding fertilizer to a dead-looking stick 
of a plant won’t miraculously cause it to come back to life. The fertilizer will 
just get washed away with the next watering.

A
number of odd jobs concerning containers don’t quite fall into any par-

noteworthy. In this chapter we take you through the basics of these various 
odd jobs because, in the long run, they help you grow beautiful and healthy 
container gardens.
In this chapter we show you when and how to repot plants, as well as how 
to clean, paint, and repair containers. We shore up everything from wire to 
wood to metal so that your containers are shiny and shipshape when you 
plant. You find out how to move heavy planters and store all your gardening 
supplies efficiently. All of these tasks are intended to make your gardening 
activities easier and more successful.
All About Repotting
Sooner or later when you’re container gardening, you’ll have to repot a plant 
or three. There are two reasons to repot:
 
✓ When plants have outgrown their containers and they need more space 
to allow for additional growth
 
✓ When you want to slow the growth of plants so they can stay happy and 
healthy in the same size container

210
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Repotting is no big deal. With a few basic tips, you can quickly become an 
expert at recognizing what needs to be repotted and when the time is right 
for repotting so you can minimize trauma to your plants. In the following 
sections, you also find out how to select a new pot and get some pointers on 
moving plants from one container to another.
Knowing what to repot and when to do it
When does a plant need repotting? Any time its roots are overcrowded in the 
container. The following clues tell you it’s time to repot:
 
✓ You see lots of roots coming through the drain hole.
 
✓ You find matted roots near the soil surface.
 
✓ You slip the plant from its container and you see more roots than soil.
 
Don’t wait for outward signs that a plant needs repotting: poor flowering, 
quickly dried out soil, stunted leaves and stems, and even leaf drop and die-
back (parts of the plant turn brown and die). These are signs of distress. 
Plants give these signals because they’re not able to draw enough nutrients 
and moisture from their current root situation. Check container plants regu-
larly, if possible, slipping them out of their pots to examine the roots for 
crowding.
Annual flowers and vegetables that you’ve started from seed in small contain-
ers need frequent repotting into progressively larger containers, perhaps as 
often as every month, until they’re ready for their season-long home, which 
should be a container chosen to accommodate their mature size. Ditto for 
young transplants that you purchase.
Permanent plants, such as trees, shrubs, and perennial flowers, may need 
repotting every few years. Permanent plants are best repotted when growth 
is slow or when they’re dormant, either before or after flowering. With this 
schedule, plants have a chance to recover from the root disturbance that 
invariably occurs during repotting, no matter how careful you are. Repot 
spring-blooming permanent plants in fall and evergreens in spring or fall.
Choosing a new container
If you want to increase growth, you need to give plants more room for their 
roots by transplanting them into larger pots. How much larger? It’s best to 
move plants to larger pots incrementally, choosing a pot that’s just a few 
inches larger than the current one. Choose a similarly shaped pot so you 
won’t have to reshape the root ball to fit the new container. (For more point-
ers on selecting containers, flip to Chapter 3.)

211
 Chapter 17: Repotting Plants and Caring for the Containers They Call Home
If you want to control growth and keep the plant from getting too big, you 
need to trim the roots (head to the “Pruning roots: A little off the ends, 
please” section later in this chapter for the ins and outs of trimming roots) 
and return the plant to the same pot or one of similar size.
 
When the plant is going back into the same pot, take the time first to thor-
oughly wash the pot using hot, soapy water or a 5 to 10 percent bleach 
solution to remove potentially disease-causing fungi and bacteria. See the 
“Cleaning up containers” section for more details about cleaning pots.
Repotting techniques
In general, you can follow the same basic techniques as you do for regular 
planting: Refer to Chapter 5 for step-by-step instructions.
Your biggest challenge may be getting the plant out of its current container. 
This may be easy, or it may take some effort if the root ball is a tangled mess. 
For small to medium plants, turn the container upside down, tap the rim, and 
slide the plant out. For larger, heavier plants, tip the container on its side and 
roll it around gently. You may need to use a rubber mallet to tap the sides if 
the root mass is stubborn.
 
Protect large ceramic and clay pots from chipping or cracking by wrapping an 
old towel or piece of carpeting around the outside before you tilt them and tap 
the sides.
Try to slip the container off the plant, rather than yanking on the plant to pull 
it from the pot. In some cases, you may have to trim off large roots poking 
through the drain hole to release the plant from its pot.
 
With large containers, let the roots dry out a bit first because this tends to 
shrink them, making them easier to extract from the pot.
Next, examine the roots. For plants going into larger containers, gently 
loosen and pull apart tangled or circling roots. If you’re repotting into the 
same-sized pot to slow growth or to maintain the plant’s current size, you’ll 
want to root prune it; see the following section on root pruning for details.
Add an inch-deep layer of fresh, moist soil mix to the new container. (Refer 
to Chapter 4 for details on selecting soil mixes.) Place the root ball in the new 
container, adjusting the depth of the fresh soil as necessary so that the top 
of the root ball sits a few inches below the rim of the pot. Begin filling in the 
gaps around the edges with fresh soil mix, tamping it down gently as you go.
 
If you don’t have time for a complete repotting job, a temporary solution is to 
remove the top few inches of potting soil and replace it with fresh potting 
mix with a little added fertilizer.

212
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Pruning roots: A little off the ends, please
Root pruning is just what it implies — using shears to cut away root growth — 
and you do it to container-grown trees and shrubs once they’ve reached their 
desired size. Root pruning controls growth and stimulates the plant to produce 
lots of the young roots it needs to take up water and nutrients.
The goal in root pruning is to remove about one quarter of the root ball. After 
removing the plant from its pot, gently untangle the edges of the root mass 
and use shears to cut away roots, especially the largest, woodiest ones, until 
you’ve cut off about a quarter of the root ball. For tight root balls that are dif-
ficult to untangle, use shears or a garden knife to cut off about one quarter 
of the root mass, slicing down the sides as shown in Figure 17-1. Then make 
vertical cuts, from top to bottom, an inch or so deep in several places. And, 
please, do this without flinching. Snipping away at a living organism may 
seem harsh, but in the long run you’re helping the plant and new roots to 
grow. Really, you are!

Moving Large Containers 
to a New Location
Consider carefully where you want large pots, planters, and barrels to go 
before you move them into place. If it’s practical, move heavy containers 
into place before you plant them because they’re lighter without the added 
weight of the soil and plant. If you have to move large pots later on, here are 
a few tips to keep in mind.
For relocating large pots, tubs, and some barrels, you can buy wooden 
rolling plant dollies or plastic saucers with wheels. (Check out Figure 17-2 
to see these and other methods in action.) These are ideal for many plant-
ers, but you need to be sure they can hold the weight of the planted, 
watered container. And if you can plan ahead, hold off on watering to 
lighten the load.
To move other large, heavy containers like planter boxes and concrete or 
stone pots, try using an old piece of carpeting or a throw rug. With a helper, 
tip the container and slide the end of a long carpet strip underneath. Slide 
the container so that it rests completely on the carpet; then you can tug it 
along as your assistant steadies it. Cardboard, blankets, and large sacks can 
work this way, too.
 
The tugging, lifting, and pushing associated with moving heavy objects like 
these can put enormous strain on your back. Planters that tip unexpectedly 
can crush toes. Be sure you have enough help, and consider hiring out big 
jobs.
Sometimes an ordinary hand truck or furniture dolly can be useful. Take care 
to move long plant stems away from the sides as you balance the container 
on the foot of the dolly. A hand truck can work for long rectangular contain-
ers as long as you can balance them.
If you have to go up or down stairs, use a pair of long wooden planks to form 
a ramp and tie the container to a rope. With a helper, pull up or gently lower 
the container slowly and securely. Err on the side of safety, and call in as 
many helpers as you need.

Keeping Your Containers 
in Tip-Top Condition
Your containers are more than a pot to hold soil and plants. They’re your 
plants’ living quarters, and they decorate your home and landscape as well. 
That’s why you need to make sure your containers are in good shape. Dirty 
containers (yes, we know that sounds contradictory) can affect plant health, 
and faded or drab-looking pots distract from the appearance of your arrange-
ment. Read on for advice on how to keep your containers in great shape.
Cleaning up containers
They’re outside, they get wet, they hold dirt — so why should you bother 
to clean containers? The answer is easy. Plants grow better in a clean and 
sterile environment, and you lower the chances of having pests and diseases 
hanging around to harm your plants. While you’re cleaning your containers, 
be sure to clean any stakes or plant supports that have seen duty in previ-
ously planted pots. Here are some quick and easy steps for keeping contain-
ers clean:
 
1. Get rid of potting soil and debris by brushing the inside and outside 
of the container thoroughly.
 
 Use a stiff plastic or wire brush for the job.
 
2. Wash small containers in a basin (or a bucket for larger containers) 
filled with hot, soapy water.
 
 For added security or with especially dirty pots, add a few drops of 
liquid household bleach to the water (wear rubber gloves for this job). 
Be sure to scrub both inside and out.
 
3. Rinse the container well, and allow it to air dry overnight before 
replanting.
 
 Remember to use fresh soil mix, too, to minimize insect and disease 
problems. If you’re starting seeds, use a sterile seed-starting mix.
Maintaining metal or wire items
Awesome flowers in shabby containers or pretty pots on chipped and peel-
ing plant stands don’t provide the good looks that we bet you’re going for. 
Naturally, containers exposed to the elements invariably fall into disrepair. 

216
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Here’s a quick and painless course on the how-tos of refurbishing metal or 
wire plant stands, brackets, and hanging baskets:
 
1. Inspect these items at the start of the season and look for any signs of 
rust or chipped or cracked paint.
 
 If a metal surface is exposed, expect it to sustain damage under outdoor 
conditions.
 
2. Wash off any dirt and debris, and let items dry thoroughly.
 
3. Select new paint, choosing a rust-free type that’s designed for exterior 
applications.
 
 Check out new “textured” paints that leave a stonelike finish. Read the 
instructions before you begin.
 
4. On a dry, warm day, find a covered or protected spot outdoors for 
painting.
 
 As inviting as it may seem on a sunny day, avoid doing the painting 
under a tree, especially if it’s breezy, or you’re likely to get all sorts of 
twigs and leaf bits embedded in the paint. If you must work indoors, 
choose a well-ventilated garage or toolshed.
 
5. Protect surrounding surfaces with a drop-cloth or newspapers, espe-
cially if you’re using spray paint or spraying on a sealer.
 
6. Sand all surfaces to remove rust or mineral deposits and to smooth 
the metal so the paint adheres adequately.
 
 Use steel wool or sandpaper in a medium to fine grade.
 
7. Spray or paint on a light coat, and let it dry.
 
 Sand lightly between coats with a very fine grade of steel wool. Repeat 
this process one to three times. Several thin layers give good protection.
 
8. Finish with a coating of clear protectant designed for outdoor use.
 
 Marine varnish offers excellent protection. Choose between glossy or 
matte finish and, again, go for a couple of applications.
Preserving wood containers
You can save work in the long run if you make sure that wooden containers 
are ready to withstand the elements before you begin planting. Choosing 
rot-resistant materials in the first place is a wise decision; redwood and 
cedar are your best bets. These materials survive for years without any addi-
tional help.

217
 Chapter 17: Repotting Plants and Caring for the Containers They Call Home
Prolong the life of wooden containers — especially those made of soft 
woods, like pine — with a wood preservative safe for plants. Many nontoxic 
products can do the job. Check label directions and cautions before you 
buy to be sure the preservative you choose isn’t harmful to plants. Treating 
the inside helps the container last; treating the outside preserves its looks. 
Using preservative on the outside of cedar and redwood containers helps 
retain their natural wood color. Otherwise they weather to gray, which 
actually can be attractive, too.
Another option is to paint or stain your containers — a good route to go with 
window boxes, because you can match them to your house. These surface 
treatments give wood longer life and allow you other decorating angles as 
well. You can follow the refurbishing tips in the previous section (ignoring 
the directions that are specific to metal pieces, of course), although there are 
a few key points to keep in mind when you’re painting or staining wooden 
containers:
 
✓ Make sure to use exterior-grade paint or stain. This is critical, unless 
you particularly like the whole process of refinishing wood — over 
and over.
 
✓ Don’t skimp on preparing the surface. Sand. Sand. Sand. Smooth sur-
faces are much easier to paint or stain evenly. Follow directions for what 
to do between coats, and use a tacky cloth to pick up any fine particles 
or sawdust.
 
✓ Consider penetrating oils. They’re as easy to apply as stain, and they 
repel water very well. Some even come in different colors.
 
✓ Test your paint, stain, or oil on the underside of the container first 
to avoid unwelcome surprises after application. The pictures on bro-
chures and paint-can labels aren’t always what they seem.
 
✓ For planters, boxes, and barrels that have quite a coat of grunge from 
mold, mildew, and water stains, consider using a chemical wash first. 
Usually designed to clean decks or siding, these products can be found 
in home centers and hardware stores. Generously spray or paint the 
wash liquid on, let it work for several minutes, and wash it off. For very 
grungy surfaces, you may have to scrub with a wire brush or repeat the 
process. After treatment, your container is all set for painting, staining, 
or oiling.
 
Some gardeners like to line the inside of wood containers with 4- to 6-mil black 
plastic. Lining does help keep moisture away from the wood surfaces, but it 
only works for the sides because you need to poke holes in the bottom for 
drainage. Be sure to trim the plastic at the top of the soil level so it doesn’t 
show.

Humpty-Dumpty Duty — Repairing 
Broken Containers
It had to happen. That wayward pass ended up in the pansies and the foot-
ball found your favorite pot, which took a tumble and is now in pieces. All is 
not lost. If the damage isn’t too bad, you can repair the pot and return the 
world to peace and harmony. If the pieces still fit tightly and you use the 
right adhesive, these tricks can help you successfully mend your wounded 
containers:
 
✓ Choose an epoxy glue. You mix the two components — one part glue, 
one part hardener — before you cement the pieces. Read the package 
directions for mixing, then apply the mending goo to both parts before 
joining them.
 
✓ Fit the pieces together and tie the pot so that it’s securely held in place, 
as shown in Figure 17-3. Use cord or rope for large pots; try easy-to-
remove painter’s tape for small ones.
 
✓ Wipe off any glue that spills out of the cracks when you fit the pieces 
together. You can use sandpaper after the glue is dry to remove any 
residue.

The time may come, too, when you need to repair wooden containers. While 
the damage may not be as earth-shattering as broken pottery, wooden boxes, 
tubs, and barrels still require care to stay in good working order. Constant 
moisture and the natural breakdown of materials may leave you with loose 
boards and poorly fitted joints. Here are a few things to look out for and a few 
ways to mend any wear and tear that you find:
 
✓ Prevent — or at least reduce — the chance of rot with wooden con-
tainers by raising them off the ground. Bricks, pavers, or even wooden 
blocks placed underneath the containers can give them just the lift they 
need. Raising the container allows the wood to dry between waterings. 
Use enough supports so that the box or tub is stable and level.
 
✓ Watch for new or widening gaps where pieces join. Check planters, 
window boxes, wooden troughs, and barrels often — at least every 
couple of months.
 
✓ If containers suddenly show signs of excessive drainage and you see 
water pouring out, check to see whether some part has come loose or 
started to rot away. Make these repairs without delay.
 
✓ Look for exposed nails, staples, or screws. Sometimes manufacturers 
assemble wooden containers with staples, and over time these can pull 
away. Small gaps only become larger under the weight and pressure of 
soil and plants.
 
✓ Rejoin boards using galvanized wood screws. The screws should be 
long enough to penetrate each piece by an inch or more. You get the 
best hold over the long run.
 
✓ Reinforce wooden sections that may be starting to rot by adding new 
pieces on the inside of the container. Use redwood or cedar blocks on 
corner or end joints, and insert screws through the original wood and 
well into the new piece.
 
✓ With barrels, you may need to reposition and reattach staves (the 
metal bands that hold them together) that are beginning to slip. Slide 
the stave up into its original spot, and use small nails with large heads to 
secure it in several places around the container.
Stashing Your Plant Paraphernalia
We know that you’re organized. You know exactly where to find your 2004 tax 
return if anyone asks (we won’t), and you can quickly locate the 1⁄2-inch socket 
wrench in your garage. So why not extend this high level of efficiency to your 
containers and supplies? Then you’ll be able to find important ingredients in 
your container gardening pursuit more easily. Plus, you can expect many con-
tainers and other materials to hold up longer if they’re stored properly. Here 
are some quick storage ideas for you to consider (someday, at least!):

220
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Make a place for all your movable pots and materials, including soil, fer-
tilizer, stakes, tools, and so on. Your reward arrives when you’re ready 
to plant.
 
✓ A storage shed is ideal. But if you don’t have one, designate a place in 
the garage for your gardening essentials. A generous cabinet may do the 
trick. Safe storage is especially important with chemical and toxic mate-
rials that need to be locked away from curious eyes, hands, and mouths.
 
✓ Make it a practice to wash containers before you store them. Brush 
them down inside and out and use a bit of soapy bleach water if you see 
or suspect mold and mildew. Let them air-dry completely before storing.
 
✓ Invert pots, planters, and barrels if you must store them outside, so that 
moisture, debris, and rainwater don’t collect inside. Cover everything 
with a waterproof tarp if you don’t have any other shelter available.
 
✓ Look through chemicals — fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides — 
at the end of the growing season to check effective dates. Dispose of 
outdated chemicals properly. Check with local authorities to discover 
proper methods and sites for disposal. Store the ones you’re keeping in 
a safe (child- and pet-proof), dry place. Check the label for any storage 
temperature restrictions; some products should not be allowed to freeze 
and must be brought indoors in cold weather.

M
any beginner gardeners are surprised by just how many pest and 
disease problems can affect plants. And many are equally surprised 
by how many problems they can manage with nontoxic methods. Gone are 
the days of weekly pesticide sprays to annihilate all potential pests. Our 
health — and the health of the planet — require us to take a more reasonable 
approach.
The key to this approach is knowledge. The more you know about the plants 
you grow and the pests and diseases that affect them, the better able you’ll 
be to identify problems and manage them in an environmentally sound way.
One benefit of growing plants in containers is that you can provide them 
with optimum growing conditions and sometimes even locate them where 
they’re less susceptible to pests and diseases, preventing problems before 
they start. Growing in containers doesn’t eliminate problems, but it can help 
minimize them.
In this chapter we give you a slew of techniques for preventing pests and dis-
eases. Sooner or later, however, chances are you’ll encounter problems on 
even the most carefully tended plants. We show you the least toxic ways to 
manage different types of pests and diseases safely and effectively.

Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Maybe you’ll never encounter a pest on your plants. And maybe we’ll win the 
lottery. They’re both possible, but the odds are against us. But fear not, help 
is right here. Read on!
Warding Off Pests and Diseases 
from the Get-Go
Keeping on top of pest and disease control in your container plants is often 
easier than in those growing in the garden. Here are a few reasons why:
 
✓ Containers are where you are — on the patio, on the porch, on the 
deck — rather than out in the garden where most pests lurk. And if a 
problem does develop, you usually see it right away so you can tackle it 
before it gets out of hand.
 
✓ You can provide individual plants with just the right amount of shade, 
soil moisture, and fertilizer to keep them healthy and growing vigor-
ously. This strong growth helps plants endure and recover from dis-
eases and pest attacks, and, ironically, many insect pests attack weak 
plants before going after healthy ones.
 
✓ Because container growing often makes use of sterile soil mixes that 
start out free of insects and diseases, soil-borne problems rarely occur, 
especially if you start with fresh soil mix each time you plant.
 
Despite the lower risk, it pays to be diligent about checking plants and con-
trolling pests and diseases. Container plants are often on display, and you 
don’t want to surround yourself with struggling, bug-infested plants. Also, you 
probably have fewer plants in containers than you would in a sprawling back-
yard garden, so you want to make sure that each one performs at its best.
A word about weeds
Just because you’re growing plants in a con-
tainer in potting mix doesn’t mean weeds can’t 
find them. Granted, they won’t be as plentiful as 
in the garden, but weed seeds carried on the 
wind will sprout in your container as readily as 
they would in the garden. Pull weeds as soon 
as you see them so they don’t compete with 
your plants for the limited supply of water and

 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
Starting with Integrated 
Pest Management
Experts have coined the term integrated pest management, or IPM, to describe 
a common-sense approach to managing pests. IPM consists of a series of 
steps, the first of which is to try to prevent problems. However, even with 
the best prevention techniques many plants will be affected by insect pests 
or diseases at some point in their lives. Rather than jumping for the pesti-
cide spray at the first sign of trouble, IPM asks you to first consider whether 
or not control is even necessary. If it is, then you start with the least-toxic 
controls first — those that target the pest and cause the least harm to other 
organisms. If these don’t manage the pest adequately, stronger controls may 
be warranted; however, controls are always chosen with an eye toward pro-
tecting benign and beneficial organisms and the environment as a whole.
Preventing pests
Pest management is as much about prevention as it is about control. If you 
do the right things for your plants, they’re better equipped to fend off insect 
attacks. Here’s a list of common-sense pest prevention measures:
 
✓ Choose resistant plants: If you know a certain pest is common in your 
area, choose plants that resist it. Read plant labels — if a variety is resis-
tant to a common pest, you can be sure the label will tell you. You can 
find plants resistant to various diseases, insects, and even animal pests 
like deer, so do your homework before planting.
 
✓ Grow healthy plants: You can’t hear it enough times. Healthy plants are 
less likely to have problems. Start with a good soil mix as recommended 
in Chapter 4. Put plants in the right location. Pests take advantage of 
plants weakened by less-than-ideal growing conditions. Water and fertil-
ize plants as needed so they grow strong.
 
✓ Keep your garden clean: Practice good garden sanitation. Remove 
spent plants, diseased foliage, dead branches, and other garden debris 
to eliminate hiding places for pests. Clean pots well before using them, 
and don’t reuse old potting soil. If you’re treating a container of plants 
for an insect problem, move it away from other plants until you have the 
problem under control. Clean tools regularly.
 
✓ Grow a diversity of plants: If you grow ten pots of geraniums and one 
of them gets geranium budworm, you can bet that all the plants will 
eventually be affected. Growing a variety of different plants reduces the 
chances that one pest will damage all your plants. And a diversity of 
plants encourages a diversity of insects, many of which are beneficial 
and will help control the pests.

224
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Attract insects that prey on the insects that damage your plants: 
Garden pests like aphids are food for ladybugs and many other insects. 
These beneficial insects can do a remarkable job of managing pest out-
breaks, so it just makes sense to invite them into your landscape. See 
the “Enlisting the help of beneficial insects” section later in this chapter 
for more details.
Monitoring plants
It’s important to know what a healthy specimen looks like so you’re able 
to recognize problems. Observe plants frequently, looking under, over, 
between, and around the leaves, stems, and flowers for signs of problems. 
It can be challenging for beginner gardeners — and experienced garden-
ers growing unfamiliar plants — to know what’s normal for a specific plant 
and what symptoms indicate a problem. One helpful technique is to keep a 
garden journal with plant names and varieties (or keep plant tags in a scrap-
book) so you can research what your plant should look like. Are those spots 
on the leaves normal for this variety or do they indicate a problem? You can 
look up the plants online or in gardening books and compare your plant with 
the photos of healthy specimens.
Identifying the culprit
If you see a problem, determine what’s causing the damage. Sometimes the 
damage is caused not by insects or diseases, but by heavy rain, wind, heat, 
or cold. Find out how to identify the most common pests affecting the plants 
you’re growing, including the damage they cause. For a start, consult our list 
of common pests and diseases coming up later in this chapter. If you need 
more help, contact reference books and Web sites, garden center personnel, 
or gardening neighbors.
 
Your local Master Gardeners’ group may have workshops and hotlines to help 
you identify pests. For a map with links to state Master Gardener programs, go 
to this American Horticultural Society Web page: www.ahs.org/master_
gardeners.
Establishing damage thresholds
Decide how much damage you’re willing to tolerate. (And yes, you have to be 
willing to tolerate some.) Don’t grab a spray can if you see the nibblings of a 
few pests or if the pests show up late in the season when plants are winding 
down anyway. But if you find masses of crawling insects or rapidly spreading 
diseases, you’ll want to take action.

225
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
Most proponents of IPM avoid using words like annihilate, destroy, eradicate, 
exterminate, obliterate, and other words of warfare. Contrary to what some 
pesticide advertisements might have you believe, most garden pests are 
simply living their lives as part of the garden ecosystem. They’re not the 
enemy; they provide food for birds and other garden denizens, and some are 
larvae of the butterflies we enjoy and try to attract. Keep the word manage in 
mind — the goal is to manage pests so you can enjoy your garden while caus-
ing the least disturbance to the ecology of your landscape.
Enlisting the help of beneficial insects
Gardens typically are populated by huge numbers of different insects, most 
neither good nor bad. The critters are just hanging out at no expense to 
the plants. But some insects are beneficial and prey on pest insects. (Well, 
they’re beneficial to us, if not to their prey.)
These good bugs are no fools. They hang out in gardens that offer the most 
reliable menu. Ladybugs, for example, feed on aphids. If you eliminate every 
last aphid with frequent pesticide sprays, ladybug passersby will take one 
look, see that the diner is closed, and move on. If they find a few aphids here 
and there, they’ll settle in for a snack and hang around to keep the aphid 
population in check.
 
To encourage beneficial insects to take up residence, maintain a diverse 
garden with many kinds and sizes of plants. Doing so gives the beneficial 
insects places to hide and reproduce. Variety can also provide an alternative 
food source, because many beneficial insects eat pollen and flower nectar, 
too. Some plants that attract beneficial insects include Queen Anne’s lace, 
parsley (especially if you let the flower develop), sweet alyssum, dill, fennel, 
and yarrow.
Following are some beneficial insects to invite into your landscape:
 
✓ Green lacewings: Their voracious larvae feed on aphids, mites, thrips, 
and various insect eggs. These insects are among the more effective pest 
control forces.
 
✓ Lady beetles (also known as ladybugs): Both the adult and the alligator-
like larvae are especially good at feeding on small insects like aphids 
and thrips.
 
✓ Spiders: Yes, we know it’s unpleasant to walk into webs or come face-
to-face with a particularly creepy specimen, but spiders are important 
allies in preventing insect pest outbreaks.
 
✓ Syrphid and tachinid flies: Syrphid fly larvae prey on aphids and thrips; 
tachinid flies parasitize caterpillars.

226
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Trichogramma and braconid wasps: Harmless to humans, these tiny 
wasps parasitize pest caterpillars, including tomato hornworm, corn ear-
worm, and cabbage worm.
 
You can buy some types of beneficial insects, including ladybugs, lacewings, 
and praying mantids, to release into your yard. However, unless conditions are 
optimum for them, they’re likely to fly away soon after you release them. If you 
choose this route, carefully follow the instructions for releasing the insects to 
increase the likelihood that they’ll hang around. Keep in mind, too, that often 
simply creating an inviting habitat for beneficial insects will encourage native 
insects to call your yard home, saving you from having to buy them.
Choosing the nontoxic, least 
invasive controls
Common sense tells us that if you can prevent a pest from reaching a plant, 
you eliminate the risk of damage. So the first line of defense in IPM is keeping 
pests and plants apart. Barriers and repellents can accomplish this for some 
pests; trapping for others. In some cases you can physically remove pests 
from plants before they cause much damage. These techniques are nontoxic 
and cause little disruption to the ecosystem.
If you know a certain pest is likely to cause trouble on a certain plant (from 
personal experience or the counsel of others) you may be able to prevent 
problems or at least minimize them with the following techniques. If you find 
these controls inadequate, you always have the option of moving on to the 
next level of control: least-toxic pesticide sprays.
 
✓ Barriers: Sometimes a simple barrier will protect plants from pests. 
For example, cover plants with a row cover (a lightweight fabric that 
allows light, air, and water to penetrate) that’s secured at the base 
of the container to keep pest insects from feeding or laying eggs on 
plants. Row covers are especially good for vegetables that don’t 
require insect pollination, such as lettuce, beans, carrots, and 
broccoli — you can leave the row covers on the plants as long as 
the pests are a threat. For plants that require insect pollination, like 
squash plants, you need to remove the covers once the plants begin 
flowering or you won’t have any squash to harvest.
 
 Diatomaceous earth consists of the fossilized shells of tiny marine organ-
isms called diatoms. Although it looks like dust to us, to small insect it 
feels like crushed glass. Spread it as a barrier against slugs, snails, and 
earwigs.

227
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
✓ Repellents: Like humans, many pests are repelled by certain odors and 
tastes. If you don’t want a human to eat your apple, you can put it near 
some smelly socks or spray it with something bitter. Likewise, if you 
want to keep deer away, hang perfumed soap or bags of human hair 
(barber shop trimmings) nearby, or spray plants with predator urine, 
which you can buy at most garden centers.
 
✓ Traps: You can significantly reduce the populations of some pests by 
trapping them. Slug traps, for example, can significantly reduce their 
numbers. Spread Tanglefoot, a nontoxic, sticky substance, around the 
base of containers or on collars around tree trunks to trap crawling bugs 
before they can reach plant foliage.
 
 Some Japanese beetle traps contain lures to attract the beetles. 
Unfortunately, studies have shown that the lures can attract beetles 
from all over the neighborhood, increasing rather than reducing the 
population in your yard.
 
✓ Mechanical controls: Many pests, such as Japanese beetles, are sluggish 
in the cool of the morning so it’s easy to knock them off plants and into 
a bucket of soapy water. You can control some pests, such as aphids, by 
hosing them off plants with a strong spray of water every few days.
Picking an Appropriate Pesticide
If your friendly neighborhood bug-eaters, hand-picking, barriers, and traps 
aren’t doing the trick, you can take further action against pest outbreaks by 
applying pesticides. Consider pesticides — even organic ones — as a last 
resort, because they all have some environmental impact.
When choosing a pesticide, ask yourself two questions:
 
1. Is the pesticide broad-spectrum or targeted to an individual type of 
pest?
 
 Broad-spectrum pesticides kill species other than the pest you’re trying 
to control. When possible, choose pesticides that target only the pest 
species.
 
2. Does the pesticide break down quickly or persist in the environment?
 
 Pesticides that persist in the environment, like the notorious DDT, have 
long-term impacts. Most environmentally friendly pesticides degrade 
quickly into harmless substances once they’re exposed to sunlight, air, 
and water. You may need to apply them more often, but that’s the trade-
off for being gentler on the environment.

228
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
No matter which pesticides you decide to use, you must use them safely. 
Always follow instructions on the product label exactly.
Both the pest you’re trying to control and the plant you’re spraying must be 
listed on the label. (Sometimes plants are listed as groups, such as simply 
“flowers.”) Follow these additional guidelines when using pesticides:
 
✓ Wear protective gear when mixing and spraying pesticides — long 
sleeves, shoes, hat, gloves, goggles, dust mask. Mix only as much as you 
intend to use right away.
 
✓ Spray when the winds are calm.
 
✓ Avoid spraying when rain is predicted, to prevent the pesticide from 
washing off.
 
✓ Spray in the cool of the morning when bees are less active.
 
✓ Store chemicals in properly labeled containers well out of reach of 
children and pets — a locked cabinet is best.
 
✓ Dispose of empty containers as described on the label. Never pour 
pesticides down the sink or into storm drains. Contact your local waste 
disposal company for appropriate disposal sites.
In the following sections, we take a closer look at pesticide products, 
grouped by type.
 
If you’re trying to grow plants organically, choosing pest control products from 
the array at your local garden center can be daunting. One way to determine if 
a product is approved for organic growing is to look for the words OMRI-Listed 
on the label. The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) is a nonprofit that 
evaluates pesticides and determines whether or not they are approved for use 
in organic growing. If a product is OMRI-Listed, it has been approved.
Biological controls
These products contain living organisms that prey on or otherwise help keep 
pests in check. They often contain microscopic organisms that feed on spe-
cific pests. These are some of the most environmentally friendly choices for 
home gardeners.
 
✓ Bt: For years, organic gardeners have been using Bacillus thuringiensis, 
or Bt, to control caterpillars on broccoli and other cole crops. There 
are now several strains of this bacterium that control different pests, so 
read product labels carefully.

229
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
 One type of Bt kills caterpillars, which are moth and butterfly larvae. Be 
especially careful using this product, because it kills all caterpillars, 
including the larvae of the butterflies that flit around harmlessly.
 
 Other strains of Bt control Colorado potato beetle, mosquito larvae, and 
fungus gnats. Bt breaks down quickly in the environment and is consid-
ered safe to use around pets and humans.
 
✓ Milky spore: Another common biological control contains the bacteria 
that cause milky spore disease in Japanese beetle grubs. After the grubs 
eat the bacteria, they stop feeding and soon die. The bacteria, which, in 
the meantime, have been reproducing inside the grub, are released into 
the soil to infect other grubs.
 
✓ Nematodes: Beneficial or predatory nematodes are microscopic, worm-
like organisms that live in the soil and prey on the larvae of all sorts of 
garden pests, including grubs, fleas, and weevils. (Don’t confuse these 
with pest nematodes, which damage plants.) Beneficial nematodes are 
usually sold in packets that you mix with water and spray on the soil.
 
✓ Spinosad: This relatively new biological control is derived from the fer-
mentation of a naturally occurring soil microbe. It controls a wide range 
of insect pests, including caterpillars, thrips, leafminers, some beetles, 
and borers. Spinosad is considered safe for beneficial insects, pets, and 
humans.
 
✓ White muscadine fungus: One of the most promising new biological 
controls contains the fungus Beauveria bassiana, commonly known as 
white muscadine fungus. This soil-dwelling fungus affects aphids, cater-
pillars, mites, thrips, and others.
Oils and soaps
Horticultural oils and insecticidal soaps are two of the most common and 
most useful all-around pesticides for home gardeners. They work on contact 
by damaging the insects’ cell membranes, causing the insects to suffocate 
or dehydrate. Although these sprays can harm some beneficial insects if 
sprayed directly on them, they break down quickly and don’t persist in the 
environment.
 
✓ Summer oil: When sprayed on a plant, this oil smothers pest insects 
and their eggs. Some summer oils are refined from petroleum; others are 
plant-based. Summer oil is relatively eco-friendly and short-lived. Use it 
to control aphids, mites, thrips, and certain caterpillars.
 
 Double-check the product label to make sure it says that it can be used 
on plants during the growing season. Then follow the mixing instruc-
tions carefully. Water the plants before and after applying, and don’t 
spray if temperatures are likely to rise above 85 degrees Fahrenheit. 
When it’s that hot, the oil can damage plant leaves.

230
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
 Don’t confuse summer oil with dormant oil. Dormant oil is meant to be 
applied to leafless trees and shrubs during winter. It’s very useful for 
smothering overwintering pests on roses and fruit trees and is often 
combined with a fungicide.
 
✓ Insecticidal soaps: Derived from the salts of fatty acids, insecticidal 
soaps kill mostly soft-bodied pests like aphids, spider mites, and white-
flies. Soaps can sometimes be effective against Japanese beetles. They 
work fast, break down quickly, and are nontoxic to humans. Soaps some-
times burn tender foliage, so carefully follow application instructions.
Botanical pesticides
For millennia people have used plant extracts to deter pests. Here are some 
of the most commonly available ones:
 
✓ Neem: Extracted from the tropical tree Azadirachta indica, neem kills 
young feeding insects and deters adult insects but is harmless to people 
and most beneficial insects. Neem works slowly and is most effective 
against aphids, thrips, and whiteflies, but it also repels Japanese beetles.
 
 Neem extract contains azadirachtin, the key insecticidal component 
found in the plant. Neem oil is effective against insects and also two 
common diseases, powdery mildew and rust, so it’s often a better 
choice for home gardeners. Neem oil gets thick when cool, so you need 
to warm it up before mixing it with water.
 
 Use either kind of neem before you have a major pest problem because it 
acts to deter pests. Neem is most effective when applied early in the 
morning or late in the evening, when humidity is high. Reapply after rain.
 
✓ Pyrethrins: Derived from the painted daisy, Chrysanthemum cinerariifo-
lium, pyrethrins are broad-spectrum insecticides that kill a wide range of 
insects — both good and bad. Use it with care to avoid harming benefi-
cial insects.
 
 The terminology can be confusing. Pyrethrum is the ground-up flower of 
the daisy. Pyrethrins are the insecticide components extracted from the 
flower and are common components of organic insecticides. Pyrethroids, 
such as permethrin and resmethrin, are synthetic compounds that 
resemble pyrethrins but are more toxic and persistent. Consequently, 
we prefer to avoid pyrethroids for home garden use.
 
✓ Aromatic plant oils:
 
• Citrus oil is extracted from citrus peels; products combining citrus 
oils and soaps are sold for controlling aphids and mites.
 
• Garlic oil repels insects and may control some fungal diseases.

231
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
• Clove, thyme, cinnamon, and wintergreen oils are showing promise 
against soil-borne pests like root maggots, wireworms, and cut-
worms. Repellents containing clove oil may deter deer.
 
✓ Hot Pepper Wax: Derived from a concentrate of cayenne peppers, vari-
ous herbs, and food-grade paraffin wax, this product controls many 
insects, such as aphids, thrips, spider mites, and leafhoppers, as well as 
some animal pests. It can remain effective up to three weeks after spray-
ing on plants, even if it rains.
 
A few botanicals have fallen out of favor because they’re broad spectrum, 
harming beneficial insects as well as pests, and because they’re particularly 
toxic to specific classes of animals. Avoid using these:
 
✓ Nicotine: A tobacco extract very toxic to mammals, especially if inhaled
 
✓ Rotenone: Very toxic to fish and pigs; no longer allowed in certified 
organic production
 
✓ Sabadilla: Very toxic to bees
Synthetic insecticides
You can successfully control most insect problems using the techniques 
and products we cover in the preceding sections. If, however, a pest really 
gets out of hand on a prized planting, some gardeners turn to synthetic pes-
ticides. Synthetic pesticides often last longer, meaning you can spray them 
less often. The downside to this is that the pesticides may continue to act 
against nonpest species long after the pests are gone. We recommend avoid-
ing synthetic pesticides or using them only as a last resort.
 
When you use any pesticide, make sure you’ve correctly identified the pest, 
and follow label instructions precisely.
Banishing Insects That Prey 
on Container Plants
Of the thousands of insect species that call our landscapes home just a hand-
ful pose problems for gardeners. By far, most insects you see on your plants 
are benign, or even beneficial, so carefully identify an insect before deem-
ing it a pest to be controlled. Below are the most common insect pests that 
you’re likely to find infesting your container plants and the best ways to con-
trol them:

232
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Aphids: Aphids are tiny, pear-shaped pests (see Figure 18-1) that come 
in many colors, including black, green, and red. They congregate on new 
growth and flower buds, sucking plant sap with their needlelike noses. 
Heavy infestations can cause distorted growth and weakened plants. 
Many plants can be infested, including annuals, roses, and many veg-
etables. Aphids leave behind a sticky “honeydew” substance that may 
in turn be colonized by black, sooty mold. The honeydew often attracts 
ants, too, and while the ants themselves aren’t plant pests, they can 
signal you to look for aphids and other honeydew-producing pests.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Aphids.
 
 
 Aphids are easy to control. You can knock them off sturdy plants with 
strong jets of water from a hose, or use insecticidal soap, spinosad, or 
pyrethrins. The soap also helps wash off the unsightly sooty mold. If you 
just wait a week or two, the aphid population boom is often followed by 
a buildup of beneficial insects, especially lady beetles, and they usually 
take matters into their own hands before serious damage occurs.
 
✓ Borers: Several kinds of beetle larvae and caterpillars tunnel into 
stems and wood, weakening plants and making them more susceptible 
to disease. The damage can also cut off nutrient flow. Borers tunnel 
into the wood of fruit trees, white birches, dogwoods, shade trees, and 
rhododendrons, among others. Other types of borers damage bearded 
iris and other perennials, as well as vegetables including corn and 
squash-family plants.

233
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
 Look for borer-resistant plants. For example, if borers damage your 
bearded irises, try Siberian irises instead. Keep susceptible plants 
growing vigorously and watch for signs of borer damage — dead bark, 
sawdust piles, partial wilting, and poor performance. When you find 
borers, cut off and destroy severely infested stems and limbs. Inject 
Bt or parasitic nematodes into remaining borer holes, depending upon 
the plant and type of borer.
 
✓ Caterpillars and worms: Moth and butterfly larvae are avid eaters and 
can cause a lot of damage to a variety of plants. Some are hairy caterpil-
lars; others are smooth-skinned and more wormlike. Birds and beneficial 
insects can keep caterpillar populations in check, so welcome these into 
your landscape. You can hand-pick caterpillars to reduce their numbers. 
If they get out of hand, the most effective way to get rid of caterpillars is 
to spray with Bt or spinosad.
 
✓ Geranium budworms: Geranium budworms are very frustrating pests 
of geraniums, nicotiana, ageratum, and petunias. The small caterpillars 
either bore into flower buds and eat the flowers before they open or 
they just feed on open blooms. The result is no flowers, just leaves. To 
confirm the presence of these heartless monsters, look for small holes 
in blossoms or the tiny black droppings the caterpillars leave behind. 
You may also see the worms on the flowers. To control, pick off infested 
flower buds and spray with Bt, spinosad, or pyrethrins.
 
✓ Japanese beetles: Japanese beetles can really be troublesome east of 
the Mississippi River, and they seem to be moving west. The 1⁄2-inch-long 
beetles have coppery bodies and metallic green heads (see Figure 18-2). 
They feed on both flowers and foliage, often skeletonizing leaves, eating 
the fleshy parts and leaving the veins. They particularly love zinnias, 
marigolds, and roses.
 
Figure 18-2: 
A Japanese 
beetle.
 

234
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
 Control can be tough. Hand-pick the beetles in the cool of the morn-
ing, knocking them into a can of soapy water. Treating your lawn with 
parasitic nematodes or milky spore may reduce the population of the 
beetles’ larvae (white, C-shaped grubs) but more adults may fly in from 
your neighbor’s yard. Try to convince your neighbors to treat their 
lawns with the nematodes and milky spore, too.
 
 Avoid beetle traps because, although they lure and kill beetles in your 
yard, they also attract beetles from surrounding areas. If you try the 
traps, keep them at least 100 feet from your plants.
 
✓ Mealybugs: These small, sucking insects, most common on houseplants, 
cover their bodies with a white cottony substance that makes them 
easy to identify. They usually feed in groups, forming a cottony mass on 
branches and stems. Wash off small numbers with a cotton ball dipped 
in rubbing alcohol; for larger infestations, spray with insecticidal soap 
or neem.
 
✓ Scale: These tiny insects look like small bumps on plant stems and 
leaves (see Figure 18-3). They hide under a turtlelike shell that serves 
as a shield. These pests suck plant sap and can kill plants if present in 
large numbers. The first sign of scale is often the sticky honeydew they 
secrete. Remove and destroy badly infested stems. Clean off light infes-
tations with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. Spray with dormant 
oil in winter or summer oil during the growing season.
 
✓ Snails and slugs: Snails and slugs are soft-bodied mollusks that feed on 
tender leaves and flowers during the cool of the night or during rainy 
weather. Snails have shells; slugs don’t. (A slug is shown in Figure 18-4). 
Both proliferate in damp areas, hiding under raised containers, boards, 
or garden debris. To control snails and slugs, you can roam the garden 
at night with a flashlight and play pick-and-stomp, or you can trap them 
with saucers of beer with the rim set at ground level. You can catch a 
remarkable number of slugs in these traps, so check them frequently, 
disposing of the catch and resetting the trap.
 
Figure 18-3: 
Scale 
insects.
 

235
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
Figure 18-4: 
A slug.
 
 
 Snails and slugs refuse to cross anything made of copper — apparently, 
it gives them a mild electrical shock  —  so you can also surround raised 
beds or individual containers with a thin copper stripping or copper 
mesh sold in most garden centers or hardware stores. Iron phosphate-
baited pellets (sold under clever trade names like Escargo and Sluggo) 
are another option; the mollusks eat the golden pellets and the iron 
phosphate kills them. The pellets are very effective and safe to use 
around pets and children, unlike more toxic metaldehyde baits.
 
✓ Spider mites: Spider mites are tiny, eight-legged spider relatives that 
you can barely see without a magnifying glass (see Figure 18-5). If the 
population gets big enough, you can see telltale fine webbing beneath 
the leaves. And as the mites suck plant juices, the leaves become yellow-
ish with a silvery or bronze stippling. The plant may even start dropping 
leaves. Mites are most common in hot, dry summer climates and on 
dusty plants. Houseplants, tomatoes, and roses are commonly infested.
 
Figure 18-5: 
Spider 
mites.
 

236
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
 A daily wash with a strong jet of water from a hose can help keep infesta-
tions down. You can also control spider mites with insecticidal soap and 
summer oil sprays.
 
✓ Thrips: Thrips are another almost-invisible troublemaker. They feed 
on flower petals, causing them to be discolored and the buds to be 
deformed as they open. They also feed on leaves, causing them to 
become deformed and giving them a stippled look (which can be distin-
guished from similar spider mite damage by the small fecal pellets that 
thrips leave behind). Impatiens, roses, and gladioluses are commonly 
infested.
 
 Many beneficial insects feed on thrips, especially lacewings. Insecticidal 
soaps and hot pepper wax are also effective against thrips.
 
✓ Whiteflies: Whiteflies look like small, white gnats (see Figure 18-6), but 
they suck plant juices and can proliferate in warm climates and green-
houses. They tend to congregate on the undersides of leaves. You can 
trap whiteflies with yellow sticky traps sold in nurseries. Insecticidal 
soaps, summer oil, hot pepper wax, and pyrethrins are effective sprays.
 
Figure 18-6: 
Whiteflies.
 
Preventing and Treating Plant Diseases
Most common garden diseases are caused by various types of fungi. As is the 
case with insects, most species of fungus are beneficial; they’re the decom-
posers that help break down the vegetable scraps in our compost bin and 
transform mountains of fall leaves into leaf mold, a garden amendment worth 
its weight in gold. However, some fungus species (along with a few bacteria, 
viruses, and other microbes) can infect our garden plants, and when they do, 
we call them diseases.
Only a few diseases really do much damage to container-grown plants, and 
most of those can be prevented — or at least reduced in severity — with 
good cultural practices or by planting resistant varieties. If you know a cer-
tain disease is a problem on a particular plant in your area, simply growing 
something else is the easiest solution.

237
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
In the following sections, we offer some tips for heading off diseases before 
they become a problem, and in case they do become a problem, we give you 
some advice for how to take care of them.
Stopping diseases before they start
Some cultural practices can help avoid plant diseases. Some of these are sim-
ilar to the pest-prevention tips we mention earlier in the chapter, but they’re 
worth repeating here:
 
✓ Choose resistant plants. If you know a certain disease is common in 
your area, choose plants that resist it. Plant labels often will tell you if 
a variety is resistant to a common disease. For example, some varieties 
of roses are very susceptible to black spot, a disease that causes, oddly 
enough, black spots on the foliage. Other varieties are very resistant to 
infection.
 
✓ Remove infected plants. As soon as you notice a plant with a problem, 
give it the yank. Even picking off infected leaves helps prevent a disease 
from spreading.
 
✓ Avoid wetting foliage. Most plant diseases require moisture to spread. 
Avoid overhead watering, and apply water to soil, not foliage. Refer to 
Chapter 15 for information on drip irrigation and self-watering contain-
ers, both of which help reduce disease problems. Don’t handle plants 
when the leaves are wet. If you have to use overhead watering, do so 
in the morning so the leaves dry quickly in the sun, rather than sitting 
moist all night.
 
✓ Space plants properly. Planting too close reduces air circulation 
between plants — a condition that invites disease. Set containers so the 
air can circulate between them. Unfortunately, planting close together is 
often the norm with flower-filled planters, so just be aware that diseases 
are more common under these conditions.
 
✓ Keep your garden clean and tidy. Many diseases spread on plant 
debris, so pick up fallen leaves and remove dead plants. Keep the spaces 
under containers clean.
 
✓ Provide drainage. Make sure your pots can drain properly. You know 
that your pots must have holes in the bottom so that water can drain 
out. But frequent checks also allow you to be sure that the openings 
aren’t clogged with roots. And if you have a saucer under your pots, 
make sure you drain it after watering so plants don’t sit in soggy soil — 
overly wet soil leads to root-rot diseases.

Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Keep tools clean. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10-percent-bleach solu-
tion (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) between cuts to prevent spreading 
diseases.
 
✓ Control insects. Many diseases are spread by insects, including the infa-
mous Dutch elm disease, which is spread by elm bark beetles.
 
✓ Grow healthy plants. Give your plants the right amount of light and 
water by putting them in a location they’re well suited to. For example, 
when sun-loving plants are grown in shade, mildew and other diseases 
are more likely to take hold. When plants get exactly what they need, 
they stand up to disease much better.
 
✓ Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer. Yes, you want to keep plants growing 
vigorously, but don’t supercharge them with nitrogen. This nutrient 
makes plants grow quickly, but the rapid growth is weaker and suscep-
tible to disease. Consider using slow-release or organic fertilizers to 
maintain healthy growth.
 
✓ Use fresh soil mix. Don’t replant in used soil mix, especially if you’re 
growing plants that may be susceptible to diseases. Compost the old, 
and refill with the new.
Choosing environmentally 
friendly fungicides
Most common garden diseases are caused by various types of fungi, and fun-
gicides are substances used to control them. Fungicides either prevent infec-
tion or kill the fungi after infection. This distinction is important, because 
some fungicides must be applied before infection to prevent the disease, 
while others are applied to already-diseased plants. Read product labels 
carefully for proper application timing and technique.
 
Most garden diseases are caused by fungi, and most products sold to control 
plant diseases are fungicides. A few of these products may also help control 
diseases caused by bacteria, but bacterial diseases are harder to manage than 
fungal diseases. There are no products for controlling diseases caused by 
viruses. Fortunately, just a handful of bacteria and viruses pose problems for 
home gardeners but if they do, the best cure is often to destroy the plant so 
the disease doesn’t spread.
The following are some of the more environmentally friendly options for man-
aging plant diseases.
 
✓ Plant extracts: Sprays containing citric acid and mint oils control a wide 
range of disease-producing fungi and bacteria.

239
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
✓ Potassium bicarbonate: This close relative of common baking soda 
(sodium bicarbonate) controls powdery mildew and other diseases. 
Several commercial formulations are available. Homemade baking soda 
sprays are sometimes effective, too.
 
✓ Bacillus subtilis and B. pumilus: Fungicides containing these soil-
dwelling bacteria are showing promise in controlling a number of plant 
diseases, including leaf blight, black mold, and powdery mildew.
 
✓ Neem oil: Especially effective in controlling black spot on roses, neem 
oil is extracted from a tropical tree. Flip back to the section “Botanical 
pesticides,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.
 
✓ Sulfur and copper: These materials are strong fungicides, but they must 
be applied carefully to avoid harming plants and wildlife. Look for fungi-
cidal soaps, which are easier and safer to apply than dusts.
 
✓ Compost tea: Some gardeners swear by compost tea — a liquid you 
brew by soaking finished compost in water, then straining off the solids. 
Spray it on the leaves to help prevent diseases. Compost tea is an excel-
lent fertilizer, too.
 
Synthetic fungicides are some of the most toxic of all the stuff sold to spray on 
plants. Avoid them if at all possible. If you choose to use a synthetic fungicide, 
make sure you’ve identified the disease and that both the disease and the 
plant you’re spraying are listed on the label. Enlist the help of local nursery 
personnel or a Cooperative Extension specialist for advice, and follow the 
label instructions exactly.
Detecting Common Plant Diseases
Plant diseases are often named by the symptoms they cause — black spot 
disease causes black spots; powdery mildew causes a powderlike coating 
on leaves. Some diseases affect just one plant part — leaves, for instance — 
while others can affect the whole plant. These clues can help you identify the 
culprit so you can take the proper control measures.
 
Many plant diseases are specific to their host plant. For example, the powdery 
mildew fungus that affects lilacs is a different species than the one that affects 
bee balm, so the disease can’t spread from your lilacs to your bee balm.
Some plant problems that mimic the symptoms of fungal diseases may 
instead be caused by environmental factors. Learn to recognize these prob-
lems so you don’t end up spraying fungicide in an attempt to “cure” your 
frost-damaged plant.
Here are some of the most common diseases encountered by home gardeners.

240
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
Diseases caused by a fungus among us
Fungi are the culprits in many plant diseases. Here are some tips on the pre-
vention, identification, and — if possible — treatment of some common plant 
diseases that are caused by fungi:
 
✓ Black spot: Like its name suggests, this fungus causes black spots on 
leaves and stems (see Figure 18-7). Black spot is most troublesome on 
roses, but it can also attack various fruiting plants. On roses, the edges 
of the spots are fringed and the tissue around the spots often turns 
yellow. In bad infections, the plant may drop all its leaves. The disease is 
most common in warm, humid climates with frequent summer rain.
 
 The best advice for preventing black spot is to plant resistant varieties. 
The second-best advice is to keep your rose planters clean. Remove 
plant debris after pruning, clean up fallen leaves, and pick off leaves that 
have spots or turn yellow. Also, avoid overhead watering, or at least 
water early in the morning so that leaves can dry out quickly.
 
 The baking soda-summer oil combination that we mention under 
“Powdery mildew” later in this list also provides some control, as does 
neem oil. Bacillus subtilis has also been proven effective at controlling 
black spot.
 
✓ Botrytis blight: Also called gray mold, this fungal disease overwinters 
on plant debris and is common on strawberries as well as petunias and 
other flowers. The blight is most noticeable as gray fuzz forming on old 
flowers and fruit, turning them to moldy mush, but it can also discolor 
or spot foliage. It’s most troublesome on older plant parts and in cool, 
humid weather. Make sure plants are properly spaced, and avoid over-
head watering. Remove and destroy any infected plant parts.

 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
 
✓ Damping off: A symptom caused by various fungi, damping off causes 
rot at the base of seedling stems, weakening them so they wilt and fall 
over. It’s mostly a problem when you’re starting seeds indoors. The best 
way to prevent the disease is to plant seeds in sterile potting soil and 
avoid overwatering. To prevent recurring problems after an infestation, 
clean and sanitize containers and fill them with fresh potting mix.
 
✓ Powdery mildew: This fungus coats leaves and flowers with a white 
powder (see Figure 18-8). Powdery mildew is most common when days 
are warm but nights are cool, and is particularly troublesome on zin-
nias, dahlias, begonias, roses, squash, melons, and peas. The disease 
is weather-dependent, so if you can keep plants growing vigorously 
through a disease cycle, they may recover just fine.
 
 Control is difficult, but there are resistant varieties. Regular sprays of 
neem oil may help minimize infection. Rose growers have some success 
using a mixture of 1 tablespoon of summer oil and 1 or 2 teaspoons of 
baking soda in 1 gallon of water; you have to use the mix often to protect 
new foliage. A commercial version of this baking soda solution is avail-
able under the trade name Remedy. GreenCure is a similar fungicide 
based on potassium bicarbonate. Another rose growers’ technique is to 
spray plants with anti-transpirants. These materials, sold with names 
like Cloud Cover or Wiltpruf, coat leaves with a thin, waxy film that 
seems to prevent the mildew from getting established — it’s worth a try.
 
✓ Root rots: A number of soil-borne fungi cause similar symptoms: Plants 
suddenly wilt and die, whether or not the soil is moist. Vinca is notorious 
for checking out like this. The best way to prevent root rot is to use fresh 
soil mix, make sure your pots drain properly, and avoid overwatering — 
let the soil dry partially between irrigations. Otherwise, all you can do is 
remove the dead plants. Once root rot takes hold, most plants succumb.

Powdery 
mildew.
 

242
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Rust: This fungal disease is easy to identify: It forms rust-colored pus-
tules on the undersides of plant leaves. Gradually the upper sides of the 
leaves turn yellow and the whole plant begins to decline. Snapdragons, 
roses, and hollyhocks are common hosts. To avoid rust diseases, plant 
resistant varieties. Also, space plants for good air circulation, keep the 
garden clean, mulch around the base of plants, and avoid overhead 
watering. Destroy infected plants.
 
If a fungal disease is common on a plant in your region, choose resistant vari-
eties or forego that plant in favor of something less susceptible. You don’t 
want to spend all your free time applying preventative sprays or treating infec-
tions. And once a plant is infected, it’s up to you to decide whether to keep 
treating a plant or to discard it. You may want to treat an expensive tree but 
toss a diseased petunia.
Abiotic diseases
The term abiotic diseases describes plant problems whose underlying cause 
is not an organism, such as a fungus, insect, or bacterium. Rule out abiotic 
diseases before treating plants with pesticides, which won’t do any good. 
Instead, follow the treatment plans outlined below for the specific disease.
 
✓ Salt burn: Salt burn is caused by excess fertilizer salts building up in the 
soil. It’s common where irrigation water is high in salts or when plants 
are overfertilized. Japanese maples are particularly sensitive to salt 
burn.
 
 The symptoms are pretty easy to recognize — leaf edges become dry 
and crispy — much like what happens when a plant becomes too dry. 
(Excess salts affect a plant’s ability to take up water, so the effect is simi-
lar to the soil drying out.) If the condition worsens, the whole leaf may 
dry up and drop, and tips of branches may die.
 
 Prevent (and treat) salt burn by flooding the soil in containers with lots 
of water, letting it drain, and repeating up to a half-dozen times. Do this 
a few times during each growing season. Just be sure the container has 
good drainage. You may also want to reduce your fertilizing.
 
✓ Sun burn: If the foliage on plants looks bleached, your plants may be 
suffering from sunburn. Did you set them out without hardening them 
off (see Chapter 5) or move them from a shady spot to a sunnier one? 
Are the top leaves affected, while the ones underneath (and therefore 
shaded from direct sun) are fine? Most plants recover from sunburn: 
Just vow to harden plants off before exposing them to the elements.
 
✓ Frost damage: Chill or frost damage usually appears as blackened foli-
age, especially on the most exposed parts of the plant. The leaves under-
neath are more protected and may look fine. Some plants, such as basil, 

243
 Chapter 18: When Bad Things Happen: Pests and Diseases
are very sensitive to cold and will be damaged even if temperatures 
don’t drop below freezing. If a cold spell is predicted, protect tender 
plants by moving them to a sheltered spot or covering them with an old 
sheet. If plants are nipped by frost and just the top leaves are damaged, 
pick off the affected leaves and the plant may recover.
 
✓ Wind and hail: Plants with large, tender leaves are most likely to suffer 
damage from wind and hail. Leaves may have holes or be shredded. 
Unfortunately, damage like this, which creates open wounds, some-
times leads to fungal infections. You can’t do much to treat damaged 
plants. If damage is limited to a few leaves, pick them off. However, the 
whole plant is usually affected, and all you can do is wait and hope the 
plant recovers on its own. If severe weather is predicted far enough in 
advance, move containers to a sheltered spot to wait out the storm.
Thwarting Animal Pests
Even containers located close to the house may be the targets of marauding 
animal pests. Wild animals will dine on container plants, especially if wild 
food is scarce. Sometimes domestic animals — yes, your beloved dogs and 
cats — can cause trouble. The first step is to identify who’s causing the 
damage. Some critters roam around at night (raccoons, cats, and deer), while 
others are active during the day (woodchucks, rabbits, squirrels, and dogs). 
Some animals love to dig (squirrels, dogs, and raccoons), while others mostly 
nibble (deer, rabbits, and woodchucks).
 
Sometimes the only way to identify the culprit is to sit and watch, especially in 
the early morning and evening when many animals are most active.
Here are some common animal pest and suggested controls.
 
✓ Birds: Birds are usually beneficial in the garden, eating pest insects. But 
some birds dig up newly planted seeds and uproot young seedlings. 
Protect containers with chicken wire cages if birds are a problem  —   
once plants are established, birds don’t seem to bother them as much. 
One exception is fruit: Cover blueberry, strawberry, and other ripening 
fruits with netting to keep hungry birds at bay.
 
✓ Cats/Dogs: Cats and dogs may use a large container for their personal 
playground. Cats use the loose soil for a litter box. Dogs dig in contain-
ers, especially if you’re using aromatic organic fertilizers, such as bone 
or blood meal or fish emulsion. To thwart cats and dogs, block their 
access to your containers with chicken wire or a gate, and use repellent 
sprays.

244
Part IV: Keeping Your Plants Healthy 
 
✓ Deer: As suburbs sprawl into rural areas and animals become accus-
tomed to the presence of humans, more and more gardeners are expe-
riencing deer damage. If they’re hungry enough, deer will come right up 
to the house to graze on your container plantings. The best control is a 
tall (8-foot) fence. Barring that, you can try spraying repellents that have 
a taste or smell that’s repulsive to deer. For containers close to your 
house, stick with taste-based repellents rather than the ones that smell 
like rotten eggs (you don’t want to repel yourself!).
 
✓ Mice/Voles: These burrowing rodents are mostly a problem in contain-
ers planted with bulbs. Block their access with wire mesh cloth and 
place crushed eggshells or oyster shells around the bulbs in the con-
tainer to deter their digging.
 
✓ Rabbits: Bugs Bunny nibbles on the tender leaves of a variety of con-
tainer plants. The simplest solutions are to block rabbits’ access with 
wire mesh cloth or a low fence or elevate your containers.
 
✓ Raccoons/Woodchucks: Raccoons digging in containers are usually 
looking for food. Prevent their activity by avoiding fertilizers with smells 
they like (for example, fish emulsion and bone meal). Woodchucks are 
only a problem on low containers and in raised beds. Fencing them out 
is the easiest control.
 
✓ Squirrels/Chipmunks: These are perhaps the most troublesome animals 
for container plants. Squirrels and chipmunks love to dig in the soft pot-
ting soil to find seeds or bury nuts. They uproot newly planted bulbs 
and plants. Once plants are established, these animals are usually less 
problematic. Unless you create a wire fortress, blocking their access is 
difficult. Try repellent sprays, and remember to reapply the sprays after 
a rain and as needed to protect new growth.
 
Avoid sprinkling ground hot pepper on or around plants to deter animal 
pests. If the animals get it in their eyes, it causes excruciating pain. Hot 
pepper wax is acceptable because it is less likely to rub off, so it acts only as 
a taste repellent.

ver notice how well some things go together? Like peanuts and baseball, 
apple pie and ice cream, stripes and plaids (just wanted to see if you’re 
paying attention). This principle applies to the container plant world, too. A 
pot full of purple pansies may dazzle the eye, but watch what happens when 
you add a splash of fragrant white hyacinths.
Mixed plantings can range from modest to majestic. A hanging basket 
combining petunias and verbena is pretty. A stately urn with an evergreen 
Alberta spruce accented with tufts of two-toned, fragrant sweet William and 
surrounded by pale pink, trailing ivy geraniums can turn heads. A group of 
cobalt blue, oversized planters displaying a fruit-laden dwarf peach tree, a 
flowering mandevilla vine climbing a container-mounted trellis, and pots of 
blazing orange and magenta New Zealand impatiens can stop traffic.
Beyond introducing you to the wonderful world of mixed plantings, this chapter 
gives you a detailed road map to producing your own outstanding displays. We 
cover design ideas and acquaint you with the color wheel and how to effectively 
combine colors in a variety of ways. We look at other design basics, too — form, 
texture, and proportion — and show you how to incorporate these ideas into 
just about any decorative scheme. We also take a look at compatibility issues — 
between plant and planter, as well as among the plants within a container.
If you’re new to gardening, the process of choosing plants can be overwhelm-
ing, so we also provide some container garden “recipes” in the chapter. 
Like their culinary cousins, these recipes can be tweaked to include favorite 
plants or to substitute plants that aren’t available. For more information, 
refer to the chapters on individual plants (annuals, perennials, and so on).

What Is Your Garden Style?
Choosing from among the countless plants and containers available can be 
daunting. Where do you begin? One way is to figure out your garden style. 
Consider the following questions:
 
✓ Are you drawn to blowsy cottage gardens where plants are crowded 
together in an informal, seemingly haphazard way? Or do you prefer tidy 
mounds of individual plants separated by decorative mulch?
 
✓ Do you like plants that grow this way and that, or ones that are 
symmetrical?
 
✓ What colors do your house, furniture, and wardrobe feature? Do you like 
brash and bold, subtle and earthy, or something in between?
 
✓ Do you like whimsical things — little decorations that bring a smile — 
or using things for an unintended purpose (like planting geraniums in 
an old red wagon or petunias in an old boot)? Or would you describe 
your gardening style as, well, more dignified (or predictable and boring, 
depending on your perspective)?
Answering these questions can help you get started on your mixed container 
plantings. If you’re nervous about your design skills, start with something 
safe. Or throw caution to the wind — after all, you can always replant.
 
There are two ways to create mixed plantings. One is to use one plant per con-
tainer and display multiple containers in a pleasing way. The other is to mix 
plants in a single container. Either way, by growing a variety of plants you’re 
sure to have an eye-catching garden all season long.
Fun with Form, Texture, and Proportion
You can play with the basic elements of design — form, texture, and 
proportion — and use them to add great depth and interest to your mixed 
plantings.
Form refers to basic plant shape. Upright, spiky iris, for example, clearly has a 
different form than round-leafed, cascading ivy geranium. Texture is determined 
by the look and feel of a plant’s foliage and flowers and runs the gamut from 
harsh and hard cactus to light and lacy ferns. Both form and texture are most 
effective when the elements balance each other without competing for attention.

249
 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
No design discussion is complete without a word on proportion or scale. This 
comes into play in two ways: The plants should be in proportion to the con-
tainer, and the container and plant together should fit the location. Making 
sure that everything fits together is usually a matter of balance. A tiny trailing 
plant in a huge tub or a wide shrub in a narrow box simply doesn’t work — 
just as a big-leafed perennial looks odd on a small table. Disparity is okay, but 
just make sure that the leap isn’t too great. If you’re uncertain, test out poten-
tial combinations when you’re shopping at the nursery. Put plants and pots 
together and see whether the combination appeals to you. Then imagine it on-
site. Will it fill the space without overwhelming it? These tips on form, texture, 
and proportion apply to your mixed plantings:
 
✓ Make sure the plant fits the pot. A design usually looks best if small 
plants are used for small pots in small spaces, and larger plants are 
reserved for large pots in big spaces.
 
 Consider each plant’s mature size in mind when matching plant to pot, 
especially when it comes to trees and shrubs. Although you can root 
prune plants to help control their size, it’s best to use a container that 
can accommodate the plant’s mature size. See Chapter 17 for informa-
tion about root pruning.
 
✓ Catch the eye and add balance with contrasting forms. Combine spiky iris 
with rounded geraniums, for example — but be careful not to overdo it.
 
✓ Create both a soft and pleasing feel with finely textured, lacy plants. 
Lobelia, small ferns, and baby’s breath are a few that fit the bill. Delicate-
looking plants soften hard container edges and blend well with other 
textures.
 
✓ For a bold focus, try big flowers (zinnia or dahlia) or large, dramatic 
leaves (hosta or elephant ear). These are particularly effective in large 
pots alongside smaller plants.
 
✓ Group similarly sized plants, but feel free to vary height. Avoid extremes 
like tall shrubs and trees paired only with ground-hugging creepers.
 
✓ Use balance and scale for container placement, too. A huge barrel on 
a tiny patio looks as out of place as a tiny dish garden lost on an expan-
sive deck.
 
A natural, gradual flow results from tall plants placed toward the back of the 
container with middle-sized plants in the center (or tall plants placed in the 
center surrounded by middle-sized plants), and low or trailing ones along the 
edges. In Chapter 7 you’ll find annuals described as thrillers (tall, eye-catching 
plants), fillers (shrubby plants good for surrounding the taller center plant) 
and spillers (plants that tumble over the sides of the pot). Design-wise, choos-
ing a mix of the three different types is a good place to start, whether you’re 
planting all annuals or a combination of different types of annuals, perennials, 
and woody plants.

250
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
Color Is Key
Many people consider the number one design element to be color, which also 
happens to the most fun to play with. Look at a color wheel and examine how it 
works. Primary colors — red, blue, and yellow — are equidistant on the wheel, 
and all other colors result from mixing these three. Next, you find comple-
mentary colors opposite each other — yellow and violet or red and green, for 
example. Finally, you see harmonious colors blending gradually between two 
primary colors, like red to orange to yellow. Shades refer to lighter and darker 
variations of the same color. Now that you know the basics, here’s a quick 
primer on what happens when you experiment with various combinations:
 
✓ For bold, vibrant looks, choose complementary colors (on opposite 
sides of the color wheel), such as yellow and violet.
 
✓ For more subtle combinations, choose harmonious blends of related 
colors like blue, violet, and purple.
 
✓ Create a soothing style with variations or shades of the same color — 
pale pink to rose-red, for example.
 
✓ Add plenty of pizzazz with energizing hot colors using red, orange, or 
yellow.
 
✓ Cool things down with refreshing blues, greens, and violets.
 
✓ Don’t forget white. It adds welcome dimension, lightens dark areas, and 
works with all other colors.
 
✓ Consider foliage, too. In addition to every shade of green imaginable, leaf 
colors include silvery-gray, yellow, chartreuse, deep maroon, brilliant 
red, and variegated (multi-toned).
Remember that both the plants and the container can contribute to the color 
scheme. A shiny, bright blue ceramic pot will set a much different tone than a 
matte, terra-cotta one.
 
Classic color schemes are one thing, but personal taste is your ultimate 
authority. The bottom line: Pick colors that you like. If you like them, they 
can’t be wrong, whether you’re going for a rainbow effect, planting orange 
marigolds and pink petunias, or arranging a simple, single-color display.
Compatibility Is Everything
Like a good marriage, a good container planting consists of compatible, com-
plementary parts: in this case, the plants and the container. For the nuts and 

251
 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
bolts of choosing containers, refer to Chapter 3. Here, we focus on aesthetics. 
Keep the following in mind when choosing your container:
 
✓ Material: Wood, terra cotta, ceramic, clay, and metal are popular 
choices. For that special, whimsical look, consider recycling unusual 
containers, including those that have been used for other things. With 
drainage provided, a hollowed-out tree stump, a galvanized tub, a wheel-
barrow, a milk can, or even an old pair of work boots can host a small 
collection of plants.
 
✓ Size: Size is key, especially for plants that last longer than a single 
season and eventually reach substantial size. Be sure that the container 
can accommodate all the plants when their root systems are fully devel-
oped. However, don’t rule out small containers: They’re ideal for com-
pact plants but need frequent watering.
 
✓ Compatibility: If every pot in a large grouping has a different size, shape, 
and color, the result might be pleasantly eclectic, but it’s more likely to 
look haphazard. One way to provide a sense of cohesion is to keep to 
a single material. For example, combine terra-cotta pots in a variety of 
shapes and sizes, from shallow bowls to tall pots, for a classic and eye-
catching display. Or, to put the focus squarely on the plants, use a row 
of identical pots (see Figure 19-1).

If you’re planting more than one type of plant in a container, make sure the 
plants have similar requirements for sun/shade and soil moisture. Rosemary 
and thyme are good companions (both like full sun and well-drained soils); 
rosemary and coleus are not so good together. (Unlike rosemary, coleus likes 
shade and moist soil.)
Five Designs for Sunny Personalities
Place these containers on a sunny deck, porch, or front stoop and prepare 
to be wowed. And if you’re looking for ideas for edibles in containers, you’ve 
come to the right place. These plants will grow quickly and will need regular 
fertilizing to look their best. Keep in mind that the soil can dry out quickly in 
hot, sunny weather, especially once the plants start to fill out, so you’ll want 
to check plants daily.
Early spring bouquet
Celebrate the season with blooming bulbs and attractive annuals in this 
colorful little mix perfect for an outdoor table or front doorstep. The design 
features a repeating theme from three types of narcissus and accents from a 
rainbow of annuals and perennials. As shown in Figure 19-2, anchoring the bowl 
in the center are stunning, tall, two-toned daffodils, set off by bright yellow mini-
daffodils; a third type of bulb — fragrant paper-white narcissus — adds height 
and continuity. Effortless violas offer compact color, and the cheery and reliable 
primroses provide contrasting bright colors and richly textured leaves.
 
✓ Container: Try a clay bowl or dish at least 18 inches across and 9 to12 
inches deep. Classic terra cotta always looks good, but you may want a 
glazed ceramic bowl to match other decor or to add color.
 
✓ Plants: Five paper-white narcissus, six daffodils, six miniature daffodils, 
six yellow or blue violas, and six yellow or blue primroses.
 
✓ How to plant: Buy and plant the daffodils in fall, as described in Chapter 
9. Then, when the bulbs pop up in spring, buy six-packs of violas and 
primroses. Space individual seedlings alternately around the rim. Note: 
If you miss the early bulb planting in fall, you can cheat and wait to find 
sprouted and budded bulbs for sale and plant everything all at once 
later in spring.
 
✓ Special tips: The daffodils may need a bit of help to keep them from flop-
ping over. Use slender stakes to tie them as soon as you detect trouble. 
Feed plants with liquid fertilizer monthly throughout the blooming 
season.

✓ Container: Go grand here, if you can, to get the most from your mini-
veggie garden. Terra-cotta pots 18 inches or more in diameter can give 
you good space for all the edibles. And, if you choose a pot with straight 
rather than tapered sides, your plants’ roots will have even more room. 
As always, terra cotta is easy to find and relatively inexpensive, and it 
displays well just about anywhere.
 
✓ Plants: One Patio tomato, one green bell pepper, one sweet basil, one 
garlic chives, and one cilantro.

Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
✓ How to plant: Start with the tomato toward the back, planting it a bit deep 
by burying a few sets of leaves. Tie the tomato stem to a stake to support it. 
Then plant the pepper next to the tomato, and drop the basil in the center 
of the pot. On one side of the basil along the front, plant the chives, and on 
the other side, add the cilantro. Leave a few inches between all the plants.
 
✓ Special tips: Save on labor later on by mixing timed-release fertilizer 
granules in with your potting soil to give plants a good start. A key to 
success with a container of edibles is early harvest. Take ripe fruit as 
soon as you can, and regularly clip foliage on the basil, chives, and cilan-
tro to keep plants under control and to ensure continuous fresh foliage.

Scented sensations
The wonderful fragrances that drift on the breeze add the final exclamation point 
in this colorful, highly textured ceramic bowl. As shown in Figure 19-4, Chocolate 
cosmos heads the list of unusual flowers displayed here, and its mahogany blos-
soms really, truly smell like chocolate. Scented geraniums spill from the bowl 
with delicate, dark pink flowers and richly textured foliage that releases a fruity 
fragrance. Dianthus is the ideal filler with masses of spicy, two-toned flowers. A 
handful of dazzling white nicotianas, standing tall in the background, complete 
the picture. Reserve a spot for this display near your outdoor seating area so 
that you can enjoy the subtle scents and captivating colors.

Scented 
sensations.
 
 
✓ Container: You have a range of colors to choose from when you select a 
heavy-duty ceramic bowl with a glazed finish. This one — a full 18 inches 
across — is big enough for a generous collection of plants. Inspect the 
inside of the pot because you may need to punch out or drill a drainage 
hole before you plant.
 
✓ Plants: One chocolate cosmos, one scented geranium, two dianthus, and 
three nicotianas.
 
✓ How to plant: Starting in the back, center the nicotianas along the rim. 
Next, plant the chocolate cosmos in the middle of the bowl, and add a 
dianthus on either side. Plant the scented geranium along the front rim, 
giving it plenty of room to spread.
 
✓ Special tips: Don’t worry if it seems like the plants don’t quite fill up the 
bowl — give them time. In fact, plan to trim back wayward stems on the 
geranium and snip off spent stems on the dianthus. Enjoy the scented 
blossoms and leaves in the house by snipping stems and leaves at 
their summer peak. This also helps keep plants within your container’s 
boundaries. All the plants except the nicotiana are perennial in mild-
winter climates; in cold regions the plants will need winter protection 
(described in Chapter 10).

Nature’s bounty
This tub offers a profusion of sensory delights — including tasty fruits. The 
star of the show — a dwarf peach — combines with luscious strawberries 
spilling over the rim (see Figure 19-5). Golden hues of tall marigolds and trail-
ing gazanias contrast nicely with masses of rich purple petunias. The dwarf 
tree performs well for years in the generous tub, offering the double bonus 
of pink spring blossoms and summer fruit. The strawberries add wonderful 
texture and an interesting cascading form, and the annuals fill the gaps with 
bright, bold color.
 
Figure 19-5: 
Nature’s 
bounty.
 
 
✓ Container: A sturdy, oak half-barrel is ideal for long-term enjoyment of 
this collection. Be sure to drill several drainage holes. The barrel lasts 
longer if you coat the interior with nontoxic preservative. If the staves 
start to slide, use nails to hold them in place.
 
✓ Plants: One dwarf peach tree, three strawberry plants, three marigolds, 
two petunias, and two gazanias.
 
✓ How to plant: First, plant the tree in the center, just slightly higher than 
the surrounding soil level. Then add the marigolds along the back, drop-
ping the petunias next to them toward the front. Alternate strawberries 
and gazanias along the front rim of the barrel where they can cascade 
over the rim.

257
 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
 
✓ Special tips: As the tree bears fruit over the years, the peaches may 
become too heavy for the small branches (look forward to this prob-
lem!), so either remove part of the crop or support the branches with 
small stakes. The strawberry plants are perennial; however, fruit pro-
duction drops after two or three years; plan to replace them with fresh 
plants every few years. Cut off faded blooms (deadhead) from the petu-
nias, marigolds, and gazanias to encourage more flowers; these annuals 
will need to be replaced each spring. (The peach tree and strawberries 
will need protection in cold-winter climates; refer to Chapter 10 for 
overwintering tips.)
Entryway elegance
Greet your visitors in style with this glorious combination of flowers in a clas-
sic container perfect for a sunny front porch (see Figure 19-6). You can enjoy 
years of midsummer color from the dwarf crape myrtle shrub. Ever-reliable 
petunias match the deep pink of the crape myrtle. Variegated ivy cascades 
with wonderful grace. Daisies add bright cheer, and the contrasting deep 
tones of spilling lobelia complete the collection. You can keep this floral 
display going season after season by simply replacing the annuals as needed 
with fresh plants.

✓ Container: Sometimes the container plays as big a role in the show as 
the flowers — that’s the case here with an impressive cement urn. You 
can discover all kinds of styles, colors, and sizes in nurseries and garden 
centers, and although they may be more costly than traditional clay 
pots, urns return dividends as garden accents.
 
✓ Plants: One dwarf crape myrtle, two English ivies, one marguerite daisy, 
five petunias, and four lobelias.
 
✓ How to plant: Start with the dwarf crape myrtle toward the center of the 
urn, and surround this with the petunias. Drop the ivies along the front rim 
and plant the daisy in the center. Fill in the gaps along the rim with lobelias.
 
✓ Special tips: Urns that overflow with flowers look best, so make sure 
that all the annuals fill in evenly. Frequent applications of liquid fertilizer 
certainly help. Keep faded flowers groomed, and pinch back the petu-
nias if they get leggy.
Two Designs for Shady Characters
A common lament is that nothing will grow under trees. That’s not entirely 
true, though. It’s true that tree roots growing near the soil surface can out-
compete smaller plants for water and nutrients, and a shady spot does limit 
the selection of plants. Instead of struggling to grow shade-loving plants in 
the ground, why not set a few containers of plants under the tree?
Fantastic foliage
If you think green when you think leaves, this container will be a treat. These 
plants have striking foliage in a range of colors and patterns to rival the most 
eye-catching flowers (check out Figure 19-7). The combination is a classic mix 
of central thriller, surrounded by fillers and spillers (see the earlier section 
“Fun with Form, Texture, and Proportion” for more on this concept).
 
✓ Container: A deep, gently curving bowl complements this combination 
of spiky, shrubby, and trailing plants. Choose a bowl that’s at least 24 
inches in diameter for best results.
 
✓ Plants: One phormium, two Persian shield plants, two coleus plants, and 
four licorice plants.
 
✓ How to plant: Start by planting the phormium in the center. Place the 
Persian shields on opposite sides of the phormium. Place the coleus plants 
on the remaining sides. Then plant the licorice plants around the perimeter.
 
✓ Special tips: Pinch the growing tips of coleus and Persian shield plants 
to keep them shrubby. Keep the soil moist but not saturated — how 
much water the plants need depends on the porosity and size of the 
container as well as wind, air temperature, and amount of shade.

Shade-lover’s delight
Dappled light, refreshing shade, and cool breezes paint the backdrop for 
this winning combination featuring a flower-filled, rustic planter box. And 
with scenery defined by lush plants blooming in cool, regal colors, you have 
a garden retreat that’s hard to resist. A combination of trailing and upright 
fuchsias with striking, two-toned flowers anchors the box with long-lasting 
color (see Figure 19-8). Lacy, light green fronds of maidenhair fern add bal-
ance and texture, while the impatiens provide almost constant color. The 
color combination of lavender, purple, lilac, rose, and pink shades harmo-
nizes well. A classic touch of white brings life and contrast to the collection.
 
✓ Container: We suggest a container made of old lumber. You may find 
rustic, recycled garden containers ready-made at nurseries and garden 
centers. Or, with a hammer and a few nails, you can put one together 
yourself using planks or boards. Stick to redwood or cedar for the 
longest-lasting results. Ours is 4 feet long, 11 inches deep, and 10 inches 
wide.
 
✓ Plants: Three upright fuchsias, one trailing fuchsia, two maidenhair 
ferns, and nine impatiens in mixed colors.

260
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
Figure 19-8: 
Shade-
lover’s 
delight.
 
 
✓ How to plant: Set the tall fuchsias along the back, leaving a few inches in 
between plants and at the corners. Next, plant the trailing fuchsia in the 
center along the front rim. Now plant the two ferns on either side of the 
trailing fuchsia. Fill in the remaining spaces with the impatiens, varying 
the colors as you go.
 
✓ Special tips: It’s important to keep your planter from staying overly wet, 
even though the shade-lovers like plenty of water. Allow the bottom 
to dry by raising the box a couple of inches; set it on bricks or planks. 
Because you need to water often, make sure you maintain a regular fer-
tilizing schedule.
Two Designs You Can Start from Seed
If you want instant results, start your container gardens with plants. But if 
you can be patient, consider starting some of your plants from seed. Starting 
seeds is one of the most rewarding ways to garden. Plus, you’ll find a much 
larger selection of varieties in seed form than as plants. For example, you 
might find a dozen zinnia varieties on the seed rack, but just a handful as 
seedlings in the nursery.

261
 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
Annual flowers from seed
You’ll have fun growing these flowers from seed (see Figure 19-9). These 
seeds germinate in just a few days and the plants grow quickly.
 
Figure 19-9: 
Annual 
flowers 
from seed.
 
 
✓ Plants: Seeds for dwarf sunflowers, low-growing zinnias, purple basil, 
and nasturtium.
 
✓ Container: A simple 22- to 24-inch terra-cotta pot lets these beautiful 
plants be the focus of the display.
 
✓ How to plant: Sow 10 to 15 seeds of each type of plant. Plant the sunflowers 
in the center, surrounded by the zinnias and the basil. Plant the nasturtium 
seeds around the perimeter of the pot so the plants can trail over the sides. 
Sow sunflower and nasturtium seeds about an inch deep; zinnias, 1⁄2 inch 
deep; and basil, 1⁄4 inch deep. Once the seeds sprout, thin seedlings, leav-
ing the strongest four to six plants of each type. (If you let all the seedlings 
grow, the resulting crowded plants will be small and weak.)
 
✓ Special tips: Pinch back the growing tips of the zinnias and basil seed-
lings to encourage bushiness. (Don’t pinch the sunflower or nasturtium 
seedlings.) Feel free to harvest an occasional sprig of aromatic basil for 
pasta sauces or peppery nasturtium leaves and flowers for salads.

262
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
Herbs in fabric pots
Freshly harvested herbs are essential in some culinary creations and are 
always a welcome addition to almost any homemade dish. Many herbs grow 
easily from seed, including basil, chives, dill, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, 
parsley, savory, and thyme. In the center of the book you can find a photo of 
herbs in fabric pots.
 
✓ Container: Containers made from fabric — usually, made from a syn-
thetic material resembling landscape fabric — are ideal for small plants 
like herbs. Many of the pots even have carrying handles, making them 
some of the most portable of all your container choices.
 
✓ Plants: Seeds for basil, chives, dill, and marjoram.
 
✓ How to plant: Sow seeds in moist soil. Sow basil, chive, and dill seed 
about 1⁄4 inch deep; barely cover marjoram seed with soil. Once the 
seeds sprout, thin seedlings, leaving the strongest three plants of each 
type of herb. (If you let all the seedlings grow, the crowded plants will be 
small and weak.)
 
✓ Special tips: Keep the soil moist but not wet. Fertilize sparingly — too 
much fertilizer leads to weak growth with less flavor. Cut sprigs or har-
vest individual leaves as you need them. Herbs are at their peak just 
before they begin to flower; if you plan to grow extra for freezing or 
drying, wait until the plants are at their peak before harvesting.
Three Designs for Hanging Baskets
There’s nothing at all wrong with displaying one glorious fuchsia or begonia 
in a hanging basket — in fact, the result can be stunning, especially when you 
display several identical baskets along a porch front. However, as with other 
containers, you can get some really special effects if you combine a variety of 
plants in the same basket.
The principles for combining plants in a hanging basket are similar to those 
for designing any mixed planting and are described earlier in this chapter. 
The difference is that with hanging baskets, size and weight are much more 
important. The larger and heavier the baskets, the sturdier the hanging 
chains and hooks must be (and the ceiling or siding that’s supporting them).
Trailing plants are usually the showstoppers of any hanging basket combi-
nation. Baskets can beautifully display trailers of all kinds — from dazzling 
annuals to classic ivy to luscious strawberries. Trailers can cascade way 
beyond the basket (ground ivy, for example) or simply spill softly over the 
rim with lots of color (lobelia).

263
 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
 
Although we describe these plant combinations for hanging baskets, they’re 
ideal for other types of containers, too. Just be prepared for a cascade of vines 
that may trail onto the ground.
The following designs all use a galvanized wire basket that you can plant 
both from the top and through the sides. Openings allow you to insert plants 
just about anywhere to achieve a full, finished look. Use a 20-inch-diameter or 
larger basket for the best display. See Chapter 5 for step-by-step instructions 
on planting moss-lined hanging baskets.
Suspended animation
Full foliage and flowers take over here, completely hiding the moss-lined basket 
as this collection of annuals, perennials, and vines cascades from the sides 
and top (see Figure 19-10). Variegated ground ivy spills like a living waterfall 
with its two-toned leaves and exceptionally long stems. Clusters of bright pan-
sies and deep violet lobelias fill the sides and top, a handful of ivy geraniums 
adds rich pink tones, and ever-reliable sweet alyssum weaves through with a 
fragrant white touch. The result is a blending of colors and textures — plants 
naturally growing together — blurring the lines that separate them.

264
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
✓ Plants: Three variegated ground ivies, six lobelias, nine pansies, three 
ivy geraniums, and six sweet alyssums.
 
✓ How to plant: Plant the ground ivies along the basket rim. Next, gently plant 
through the sides, using the six lobelias and six of the pansies. This will 
allow space for the ground ivies to cascade. Pull plants through the sides 
and tuck extra moss around the roots so they’re secure. Finish by adding 
ivy geraniums, the remaining pansies, and the sweet alyssum in the top.
 
✓ Special tips: Pick off the spent flowers on the geranium and pansy 
plants. If ivy stems get too long, cut them back. After the first flush of 
flowers passes on the lobelias and sweet alyssums, use scissors to shear 
off the spent flowers to encourage rebloom.
Made for the shade
This combination of flowers in rich colors and textures is sure to light up a 
shady spot on your deck or patio — lavenders, purples, blues, and pinks are 
set off by bright white. Featured are the arching stems and abundant fuchsia 
flowers, followed by big, bold begonias. Impatiens beautifully fill the gaps, 
and ivy winds its way throughout, lending texture and style (as shown in 
Figure 19-11).

 Chapter 19: Creating Eye-Catching Container Gardens
 
✓ Plants: One Cascade fuchsia, three white Nonstop begonias, nine mixed-
color impatiens, twelve Cascade Mix lobelias, and three variegated 
English ivies.
 
✓ How to plant: Plant the three English ivies along the basket rim. Next, 
gently plant six of the lobelias and six of the impatiens through the 
sides of the basket, tucking extra moss around the roots to keep them in 
place. Center the fuchsia in the top, then evenly space the three bego-
nias around it. Finally, fill in the rest of the top with the remaining impa-
tiens and lobelias.
 
✓ Special tips: Begonia stems are fragile so be careful at planting time 
and during maintenance. Fortunately, if you break a stem the plants will 
quickly regrow. When watering, avoid wetting the foliage of the fuchsia 
and begonias to minimize disease problems, and pick off the spent flow-
ers. Use scissors to cut back the impatiens and lobelia after flowering; 
they’ll quickly regrow and produce more flowers.
Color connection
The goal for this wire basket is a mad mix of multicolored flowers. Trailing 
lantana sets the stage with arching stems and spectacular flower clusters in 
yellow, pink, peach, and orange. Another awesome trailer, ivy geranium, adds 
arresting red as it weaves through marigolds and lavender and purple petu-
nias. Completing the picture, lobelias in shades from white to deep blue grow 
through the sides, as shown in Figure 19-12.
 
✓ Plants: One Confetti trailing lantana, two Mini Cascade ivy geraniums, 
six mixed-color marigolds, twelve Cascade Mix lobelias, three Cascade 
Purple petunias, three Cascade Lavender petunias.
 
✓ How to plant: Plant the two ivy geraniums on opposite sides of the 
basket rim. Next, arrange the six petunias around the sides, alternating 
colors. Then fill in the sides with six of the lobelias. Center the lantana 
on the top and surround it with evenly spaced marigolds. Finish off the 
top with the rest of the lobelias.
 
✓ Special tips: These large plants require consistently moist (but not 
soggy) soil. Prune back long stems to encourage plants to stay bushy. 
Deadhead the lantana, geraniums, petunias, and marigolds by picking off 
the spent flowers. Use scissors to cut back the lobelias.

S
ome plant groups are so interesting and unique they merit a section all 
their own. In this chapter, we finish off the design discussion with a look 
at some special types of plants that are perfect for container gardens, includ-
ing some of the easiest and some of the most challenging.
Taking it Easy with Cactuses 
and Succulents
Cactuses and succulents offer advantages to gardeners who may not have all 
the time in the world. They usually require far less maintenance than, say, a 
pot of pansies. For example:
 
✓ Most cactuses and succulents grow slowly, and that means less time 
repotting plants that outgrow their containers. Of course, slow growth 
may also mean waiting a few years (how about 30?) before you’re 
bowled over by the extraordinary blooms some cactuses produce.
 
✓ For gardeners north of zone 9, containers offer the chance to move 
tender varieties indoors when the temperature starts to drop.

268
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
Seeing what makes succulents special
A succulent is a plant that has adapted to arid conditions by creating water 
storage units in leaves, stems, and roots. Succulents are native to many dif-
ferent environments:
 
✓ Deserts that may suffer slightly cool temperatures at night (in the range of 
50–60 degrees Fahrenheit) and high deserts that may get snow or frost
 
✓ Seaside areas where water-holding capacity has more to do with protec-
tion from high salinity than the dryness of the surroundings
 
✓ Dry, cold mountainside crevices
 
✓ Many temperate (neither very hot nor very cold) areas
Most succulents have evolved to store water during the rainy season and 
then use it during the dry season. Some succulents rely on summer rains, but 
for many, the wet season arrives in winter, and that’s when growth occurs. 
The rest of the year, the plants hunker down and wait, lying dormant. As 
you may know from visits or pictures, the Southwest U.S. desert in spring is 
a sight to behold: Winter rains come, and suddenly plants everywhere are 
adorned in bright bursts of flowers.
Cactuses are one type of succulent and are best known for their sharp spines. 
These spines make them interesting to look at but challenging to handle. 
Keep cactuses away from footpaths, doorways, and anywhere else the spines 
could harm passersby. In this chapter when we refer to succulents we’re 
including cactuses as well, unless we say otherwise.
Growing cactuses and succulents 
in containers
The basic rules for growing most succulents in containers are pretty simple. 
Just keep the following two tips in mind:
 
✓ Shade versus sun: Provide as much light as possible during the summer — 
although full sun in really warm places, including their desert homelands, 
can be too hot for many succulents in the confines of a container. Some 
types prefer part shade — see the list at the end of this chapter.
 
✓ Shelter from the cold: Protect succulents from cold weather in the 
winter. Move them indoors to a sunny window where temperatures 
remain above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
If you have large, heavy containers, plan to put them on wheels — or start 
pumping iron.

269
 Chapter 20: Cultivating Specialty Plants in Containers
Choosing containers
Succulents lend themselves to terra-cotta pots — both aesthetically and 
because terra-cotta is porous, which keeps roots from sitting in water. Feel 
free to use a shallow container (just 4 to 6 inches deep) if it looks best with 
your plants — succulent roots don’t go very deep — but be sure it has drain-
age holes. For a plant with a rounded shape, choose a container that’s 2 
inches wider than the plant. For an upright plant, choose a pot that’s half the 
diameter of the plant’s height.
Selecting soil mix
Quick drainage is the most important quality of a soil mix designed for suc-
culents. The standard mix consists of one-half organic matter (peat moss, leaf 
mold, or something like that) and one-half grit (crushed rock or sand). You 
can find many cactus and succulent mixes already bagged.
Planting
Design your succulent containers following the same principles that you 
apply for other plants: Combine something tall and spiky, something 
mounded, and something trailing. A well-balanced landscape can be accom-
plished by using one large container for several plants. Or, put each plant 
in its own container and then group the pots — this mix-and-match method 
gives you the freedom to rearrange on a whim.
 
When planting cactuses, care is the key word — for yourself and the plant. 
Wear thick gloves and/or wrap the cactus in a sleeve of thickly layered paper 
and use the ends as a handle (see Figure 20-1). (If you get stuck with a few 
spines, use a piece of cellophane tape to remove them.)
 
Most cactuses and many other succulents have shallow roots, so don’t plant 
too deeply. Burying part of the stem invites rot to set in. Make sure that the 
soil level in the pot is no higher than the level of the soil in the plant’s nursery 
container.
Maintenance
First of all, it’s a myth that cactuses and succulents are maintenance-free. 
You do need to water them and feed them.
 
Water regularly during the growing season — remember that this can be 
winter for some species. The principles are the same as with other container 
plants (see Chapter 15); however, allow the soil to dry out more completely 
between waterings. During their dormant season and in cool temperatures 
(around 50 degrees Fahrenheit), most cactuses and succulents can go without 
water for weeks at a time. Don’t become complacent and forget that the poor 
things are even alive. Resume regular watering just before the growing season 
begins.

container.
 
When plants are in a growing stage, fertilize about once a month — or every 
other time you water, if you water every two weeks. Succulents need all the 
nutrients that other plants do — nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium — 
plus trace elements. You can use just about any complete liquid fertilizer or a 
special fertilizer designed for cactuses and succulents, or try a tomato fertil-
izer at half-strength. For more on fertilizing, check out Chapter 16.
Selecting cactuses and succulents
Mail-order sources (see the appendix) offer tantalizing pictures and descrip-
tions of what’s available. As with any plant purchase, read carefully and plan 
ahead. If you live in a cold-winter area, remember to keep in mind what hap-
pens to those beauties in January. Buying cactuses and succulents locally 
is always possible too — check out nearby nurseries to get a feel for what 
different plants look like and which ones are adapted to your climate. As you 
shop, look for plants that aren’t wrinkled or shrunken at the base near the 
soil. Avoid cactuses with broken spines.
Because succulents come from many different parts of the world with dif-
ferent altitudes, temperature ranges, and rainfall patterns, it’s impossible to 
make blanket statements about which plants to choose and how to care for 
them. Pay attention to the cultural information for each species, and then 
group the plants in containers accordingly.

271
 Chapter 20: Cultivating Specialty Plants in Containers
Here are just a few of the hundreds of cactuses and succulents to look for 
and try in containers. The plants are listed alphabetically by common name 
where applicable, with the botanical name given (in italics) to avoid possible 
confusion. Most are hardy outdoors in zones 9 and 10; in other climates, plan 
to move the pots indoors for winter. Remember that hardiness zones, when 
listed, are for plants growing in the ground, and container plants aren’t that 
tolerant of cold.
Cactuses for containers
You may enjoy growing any of these cactuses:
 
✓ Acanthocalycium glaucum: Moderate-growing, small grayish mound 
with brown to black spines has showy yellow or orange flowers. Give it 
part shade in really hot areas; water in spring and summer.
 
✓ Beehive cactus (Coryphantha missouriensis): Native to Canada and 
the United States, this is a true cold-hardy species, able to grow as far 
north as zone 3. Only 3 inches tall, the beehive forms clusters with gray 
spines. Flowers are fragrant and green, followed by red fruit in summer. 
During the dormant season, beehive cactus may actually shrink so much 
that it retreats underground. C. vivipara is a cold-hardy relative with 
magenta flowers.
 
✓ Bishop’s cap or bishop’s miter (Astrophytum myriostigma): Short and 
rotund, its white speckles (rudimentary spines) give the plant a silvery 
look. Expect it to grow to the size of a large grapefruit by ten years of age.
 
✓ Golden barrel cactus (Echinocactus grusonii): A globe with golden-yellow 
spines, it grows slowly to 6 inches, sometimes larger. Don’t wait around for 
flowers — they appear only after 30 or 40 years. Provide full sun.
 
✓ Hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus viridiflorus): Stems form clusters to 6 
inches. Flowers are fragrant and lime-green. E. triglochiodiatus, a hardier 
species (to zone 5), has stem clusters to 1 foot, 1-inch pale gray spines, 
and deep pink flowers.
 
✓ Old-man-of-the-mountains (Borzicactus celsianus, also listed as 
Oreocereus celsianus): White hairs create a shaggy beard look. The 
plant forms a medium-size column eventually reaching a foot tall, with 
magenta flowers popping out here and there.
 
✓ Orchid cactus (Epiphyllum): An excellent hanging basket plant, orchid 
cactus resembles a wad of stems, but in bloom can be spectacular — 
fragrant flowers in neon colors. Provide part to full shade.
 
✓ Parodia: Globular plants to 1 foot tall grow by forming offsets. Flowers 
look like daisies. Don’t water in winter. Try P.magnifica (P. notocactus), 
with white-spined ribs.

272
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
✓ Pincushion cactus (Mammillaria bombycina): Short cylinders up to a 
foot tall produce offsets covered in soft, white down and yellow spines. 
Pink flowers are big — at least 3 inches wide.
 
✓ Prickly pear or cholla (Opuntia): Prickly pear has flattened, oval stems, 
and cholla has cylindrical stems. Some are spinier than others. They tol-
erate more rainfall than other cactuses. Try O. compressa, O. fragilis, or 
O. vivipara.
 
✓ Sea urchin (Echinopsis): This is a big group of globular or columnar, 
medium-to-fast-growing plants. Expect a wide choice of flower colors.
Succulents for containers
These are our favorite succulents. By the way, if you’re looking for the aloe 
plant, it’s covered in Chapter 14.
 
✓ Cub’s paws (Cotyledon ladisminthensis): This is a shrubby, spreading 
plant, about a foot high. Deciduous green leaves are toothed at the top 
and have a reddish margin. Provide part shade.
 
✓ Crassula pubescens: Tuck this small, creeping ground cover into a con-
tainer. Give it plenty of sun to bring out the leaves’ bright red tones.
 
✓ Echeveria: Choose from several species of rosette-forming plants with 
colorful foliage.
 
✓ Houseleeks or hens and chicks (Sempervivum): These rosette-forming 
plants are probably the best-known succulents. They’re available with 
leaves in shades of green and red — cobweb-looking hairs circle some of 
the leaves. Plants spread by offsets; if one breaks off, tuck it into another 
pot, and it will root easily.
 
✓ Jade plant (Crassula): In mild climates, this shiny-leafed favorite can 
grow up to 6 feet tall. It produces little pink flowers in midwinter.
 
✓ Jovibarba heuffelii: Tuck these rosettes into fast-draining pots. Choose 
from many varieties with leaves of different colors — bronze, chocolate, 
and violet. Hardy to zone 6.
 
✓ Lewisia rediviva: Native to the Rocky Mountains (and hardy to zone 4), 
this is a colorfully blooming plant that demands very fast drainage. 
L. tweedyi, native to the Cascade Mountains, is hardy to zone 5.
 
✓ Queen Victoria century plant (Agave victoria-reginae): Spiky, short, 
green leaves edged in white form a dramatic 1-foot rosette. The plant is 
slow growing, and 13-foot(!) flower stalks take 30 years to bloom — not a 
century. A. utahensis is a cold-hardy relative.
 
✓ Sedum (Sedum): Many species are among the more versatile container 
plants. Check on their hardiness — certain varieties can grow in climates 
as cold as zone 3. Some form very showy flower heads; a popular choice 
is S. spectabile Autumn Joy.

A hanging succulent design: 
Textured treasures
Splendid textures, outstanding shapes, and wonderful colors give this collec-
tion of succulents special status. Succulents are easy plants to grow in hang-
ing baskets made of wire, filling gaps and spaces ideally. Here the rosettes of 
hen and chicks play off the smooth texture of the jade plant. Plus, you have 
the interesting colors of various upright and trailing sedums, as shown in 
Figure 20-2.
 
Figure 20-2:

treasures.
 
 
✓ Container: Use a galvanized wire basket that you can plant both from 
the top and through the sides. Openings allow you to insert plants just 
about anywhere to achieve a full, finished look. Use a 20-inch-diameter 
or larger basket for the best display. See Chapter 5 for step-by-step 
instructions on planting moss-lined hanging baskets.
 
✓ Plants: One jade plant, one hen-and-chicks plant, one Sedum spectabile 
(upright sedum), three donkey tails, one Sedum cauticolum, six Cape 
Blanco sedums, six Ruby Glow sedums, and six Pork and Beans sedums.

274
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
✓ How to plant: Plant the six Ruby Glow sedums around the basket rim. 
Next, gently plant through the sides, using the six Pork and Beans 
sedums, the six Cape Blanco sedums, and the hens and chicks plant. 
Pull plants through the sides and tuck extra moss around the roots so 
they’re secure. Finish by planting the remaining plants in the top.
 
✓ Special tips: Use a special soil mix for these plants, and don’t overwa-
ter them. Take care handling delicate trailers such as the donkey tails. 
Simply tuck extra stems in bare spots, holding plants through the wire 
with extra moss.
Branching Out with Bonsai
On the opposite end of the spectrum from growing easy-care succulents, 
bonsai requires a commitment to careful watering, pruning, training, feeding, 
and more. In a nutshell, bonsai is the horticultural art of growing dwarf trees 
in small containers. The idea is to evoke nature in miniature — an ancient 
twisted pine on a rocky precipice or a forest of lacy maples with a mossy 
carpet underneath. Fine art is involved in selecting the plants and containers, 
and training and displaying the plants.
Bonsai is an engrossing hobby with dedicated followers all over the world. 
The pastime also revolves around an entire realm of special equipment and 
tools: low, flat clay pots; special shears; special wire; and so on.
You can buy bonsai plants already trained. Figure 20-3 shows a typical bonsai 
plant. Before taking one home, make sure you have full directions on water-
ing, feeding, pruning, and other care. Friendly advice: Never give someone 
else a bonsai plant as a gift unless you know that he or she wants to take on 
the responsibility that goes with it.
 
If you want to get a taste of what bonsai is about — to just put a toe in the 
water — you can experiment with small plants in containers. Some succulents 
look at home in bonsai pots and can thrive in their shallow soil; the common 
jade plant is one that actually starts to take on the aged look of a bonsai.
Or, browse nurseries looking for small pines, junipers, or false cypresses 
(Chamaecyparis) that have twisted branches or other signs of character at 
a young age. Prune the root ball of your selected plant by as much as one-
third, and plant it in a pot that’s 4 or 5 inches wide, making sure that you 
add at least an inch of new soil around the root ball’s sides. Prune the top a 
bit to expose some of the trunk, trimming off a few side shoots up from the 
base. Sorry, that’s about as specific as we can get — every plant is different 
in terms of its requirements and responses. Keep the plant in part shade, and 
water often enough to ensure that the soil stays moist. If you like doing this 
sort of thing and you enjoy how the plant looks, launch a full-fledged trip into 
the details of tending to these small-scale trees. Good luck.

Celebrating with Special-Occasion Plantings
Plants take on symbolic meanings at different times of the year. Here are 
some suggestions to help you make the most of these botanical treasures.
Live Christmas trees
The days of silver foil Christmas trees are over (at least for most of us), and 
people are once again returning to real trees. The most real tree of all is a 
living tree, roots and all, that you plant outdoors after the holidays. In all but 
the warmest parts of the country, you’ll be looking at hardy evergreens — 
such as spruces, firs, and pines — which are sold in containers or balled and 
burlapped. If you have the yard space, it’s very rewarding to plant a tree each 
year and be able to look back and reminisce as the trees grow — “We got that 
tree the year you were born.”
Live trees are expensive, so before you get your heart set on one, consider 
the following:
 
✓ Size at purchase: Think small. Really small. If you’re used to a 7-foot-tall 
tree commanding a quarter of your living room, think again. First of all, 
subtract at least 18 inches from the height of the tree for the root ball — 
in other words, you’d be decorating a 51⁄2-foot-tall tree. Then consider that 

276
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
you’d need half a football team to carry the tree into the house. A tree 
that size may weigh 100 pounds or more. Head to a nursery and heft a few 
trees to imagine transporting one home and into the house.
 
✓ Time spent indoors: Evergreen trees don’t go completely dormant in 
winter, but they come close to it. If you bring the tree indoors for a 
month, it will start to break dormancy. Then, when you plant it out-
side in January it may suffer freeze damage. Plan to keep your living 
Christmas tree indoors for a week and no more than 10 days, preferably 
in the coolest room out of direct sun.
 
✓ Future size: Most spruces, firs, and pines get big — really big — as in 50 
to 100 feet tall. Can your yard accommodate such a large tree? You can 
keep these trees in containers for a few years, but they’ll soon outgrow 
even the largest containers.
If you have your heart set on a big tree but want to plant a living one, too, 
here’s one way to have your tree and plant it too: Buy a small live tree, deco-
rate it, and display it outdoors, on your front porch or wherever you like. 
Have a second, cut tree in the house for the holidays.
Another option is to go for a dwarf evergreen. These may not have the exact 
same shape and aesthetic of a traditional tree, but they’re a good compro-
mise if space is limited. Dwarf Alberta spruce have that perfect conical 
shape and grow slowly to a mature height of about 6 feet, so they can remain 
in a container permanently. Other relatively small evergreens are dwarf 
Korean fir, dwarf arborvitae, and dwarf blue spruce. Read plant tags care-
fully, because the term dwarf is relative. Yet another option is to decorate 
an evergreen houseplant, like Norfolk Island pine. (Read more about these in 
Chapter 14.)
Holiday and gift plants
How many people have received holiday and gift plants — azaleas, lilies, gar-
denias, miniature roses, mums, rosemary “trees” — only to have them wither 
after a week or two? Many people then decide that they don’t have a green 
thumb and give up on gardening. The reality is that most gift plants have been 
forced into bloom out of season or with such exacting conditions that even the 
most expert gardeners have a tough time keeping them alive. Consider these 
plants to be longer lasting than cut flowers, but not permanent. If you can keep 
them alive longer than a month, pat yourself on the back.
 
If you want to give a plant that will last, visit a nursery with a knowledge-
able staff and ask for their advice. The answer you get will depend upon the 
season, what’s in bloom at the time, and what grows well in your climate. 
Consider an easy-care houseplant, especially during the winter months. 
Include care instructions with the plant, too.

Working with Water-Loving Plants
All you really need for a water garden is something that holds water. By 
including water plants and special features like fish, stones, a small submers-
ible pump, and maybe a fountain nozzle, you can create a container garden 
with tremendous appeal.
Planting a water garden
The process for planting your water garden is a simple one. First, select a 
decorative vessel — a large urn, a watertight barrel, a broad glazed bowl, or 
anything else that holds water. Find a permanent location for the container 
(especially if it’s large), arranging the container so it’s level. Then fill the con-
tainer with water within 4 to 6 inches of the top, and add a few bricks to set 
potted plants on.
Now you’re ready to plant in the pots that will be submerged. Choose special 
bog or water plants that prefer a wet existence. You can find these plants in 
nurseries and some garden centers. They range in size from tiny 3-inch guys to 
larger 1-gallon plants. Look for plants with outstanding flowers (Japanese iris, 
water lily, cardinal flower, marsh marigold) or attractive foliage (water clover, 
houttuynia). Some give you interesting form (horsetail, fiber-optic grass, sweet 
flag) or wonderful texture (shellflower, parrot’s feather, waterpoppy).
For the underwater pots, use terra-cotta pots or special plastic baskets 
designed for water plants. Here’s how you plant them:
 
1. Fill the pots with heavy garden soil (lightweight potting mixes dissolve 
or float up), and pot the plants just as you would any container plant.
 
2. Leave room, though, for a layer of gravel or small rocks on the soil 
surface to keep the soil from washing away, as shown in Figure 20-4.
 
3. Rinse the outside of the pot to remove any loose soil or debris before 
you drop it in the water.
 
4. Submerge the pot in the water.
 
 Place most plants so that the rims are at water level. Allow others to 
float, and set water lilies a bit deeper, lowering them as new growth 
appears, as shown in Figure 20-5.

 Chapter 20: Cultivating Specialty Plants in Containers
Here are some quick tips for success with water gardens:
 
✓ Combine plants with different forms and textures for maximum interest.
 
✓ If you’re using a barrel or other deep container for your water garden, 
elevate the submerged pots on bricks so that they don’t sit too deeply in 
the water.
 
✓ The easiest plants to use are floating ones, and as a bonus, they help 
keep the water clear by using up nutrients in the water.
 
✓ Use waterproof sealant to seal cracks in barrels or holes in ceramic pots.
 
✓ Choose your location carefully: This is one container garden that you 
won’t be moving, even if you want to, because it will be very heavy. Look 
for a spot with sun to partial shade.
 
✓ Select compact plants, because even with barrels, space is minimal. 
Many water plants become invasive; stick with smaller varieties or 
young plants and divide them if they grow too large.
 
✓ Add a goldfish or three if your container is at least 15 inches deep.
 
 Be careful with ceramic bowls or metal tubs in the summer sun — they 
can get hot, raising the water temperature dangerously high for fish.
Check with a garden center that handles water garden supplies for information 
on pumps, fish, maintenance, local factors, and other planting steps.
A water garden design: Reflective beauty
Enjoy the wonderful textures and brilliant flowers of aquatic plants in this 
easy-to-assemble water garden, which is shown in Figure 20-6. A watertight 
half-barrel can host a collection of floating and submerged plants. Japanese 
iris provides dramatic flair with spectacular spring blooms and deep green 
foliage. Parrot’s feather fills the gaps with fine, delicate foliage, and shell-
flower adds distinctive form from undulating petals in a rosette arrangement. 
Purple-leaf cardinal flower lends a contrasting note with brilliant red summer 
flowers on long stems. Water hyacinths finish the scene, with their unique 
shape and lavender summer flowers.
 
✓ Container: Recycled wine or whiskey barrels are ideal for an impromptu 
water garden that you can set up on your patio or deck. The watertight 
barrels are long-lasting and decorative, giving you ample space for 
plenty of plants.

280
Part V: Designing and Decorating 
 
✓ Plants: One Japanese iris, one cardinal flower, one clump of parrot’s 
feather, one shellflower, and three water hyacinths. (These are all spe-
cial aquatic plants.)
 
✓ How to plant: Use plastic or terra-cotta pots and heavy garden soil for 
the cardinal flower, iris, and parrot’s feather. Plant them in individual 
pots, and cover the soil surface with rocks. Rinse away loose dirt and 
debris, and then submerge the pots in the barrel filled with water, rais-
ing them on bricks if necessary so they sit at the proper height. Simply 
float the surface plants — shellflower and water hyacinth — on the 
water toward the front of the tub.
 
✓ Special tips: Don’t be alarmed if the water turns pea green at first. 
Discoloration occurs when the dissolved nutrients in the water fuel 
small algae. The murkiness is only temporary, and the water quickly 
clears. Add a special touch to your garden with a small submersible 
pump to give the engaging sounds of splashing water. And don’t forget 
the fish. Goldfish (yes, the kind that you win at the county fair) are a per-
fect addition and give the water ecological balance — be sure to check 
locally for cold-weather care of fish in your climate.

G
rowing in containers isn’t just fun, it’s also one way 
to make gardening accessible to people who might 
otherwise be deprived of the joys of gardening. Chapter 21 
contains tips to get you started.
The key to successful gardening is “right plant, right 
place,” and container growing is no different. Choosing 
plants involves evaluating conditions and deciding what 
you want from your gardens, then coming up with your 
options. The lists in Chapter 22 will help you get started.
And finally, if your local gardening center doesn’t have the 
exact plant you’re looking for, or if you like to do research 
online, head to the appendix. There we list dozens of 
resources that you can turn to for more information.

Chapter 21
Ten Ways to Make Gardening 
More Accessible
In This Chapter
▶ Making gardening easier for people of all ages and abilities
▶ Using special tools and techniques
▶ Designing easy-to-navigate gardens
A
ge, injury, limited mobility, and other factors can pose challenges to 
working in a backyard garden. But that doesn’t mean that gardening 
has to be off-limits. In fact, people who can’t get out and dig in the garden are 
among those who benefit most from working with plants. Fortunately, tools 
and techniques are available to make gardening more accessible to people of 
all ages as well as those with limited physical, mental, and emotional abilities. 
And growing in containers tops the list!
Here are several ways to make gardening accessible to everyone.
Growing Plants in Containers
Choose containers that bring plants up to a height that eliminates bending 
and minimizes reaching. Figure 21-1 shows how a garden can be modified for 
folks who can’t bend or stand.
Place containers in areas that are easy to access — perhaps along a paved 
pathway, on a patio, or indoors. Set large, heavy pots on castors to make 
them easier to move. Window boxes are often a good choice, because they 
can be tended to and enjoyed from inside and outside. Flip to the color sec-
tion in the middle of this book for a photo of a container garden built to 
accommodate a wheelchair. (Consult the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA) Standards for Accessible Design Web site, www.ada.gov/stdspdf.
htm, for design specifications.)

Creating Easy-to-Navigate Paths
When designing a garden that’s accessible for everyone, avoid pebble paths, 
uneven cobbles, and mulch, all of which can be difficult for people with 
mobility limitations to navigate. Choose hard, smooth surfaces (but lightly 
textured for good traction), and keep paths as level as possible. Make paths 
wide enough for two people to walk side by side as well as wide enough to 
accommodate a wheelchair. Provide wider spots for turning. Make sure paths 
drain well to avoid puddles and ice buildup. Place container plants close 
enough to the paths so they’re easily reached, but off the traveled areas so 
they don’t hinder foot and wheelchair traffic.
Individuals with visual impairment benefit from clearly delineated paths and 
gardens. Use lighting and reflective materials as well as contrasting textures 
and colors.
Adding Areas for Frequent 
Sitting and Resting
Set up benches or other places to rest, preferably with shelter from the wind 
and sun. Elevate containers so they can be tended from a seated position. 
When you’re working on your containers, use a garden scooter — a low, 
wheeled device that you sit on so you can roll between planters.

285
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Make Gardening More Accessible
Using the Right Tools
You don’t need full-sized tools when you’re gardening in containers. Look 
for small, lightweight, ergonomically designed tools that minimize the stress 
on joints and muscles. You can also find special grips to attach to tools. Use 
extra padding to prevent sore hands and knees.
Simplifying Tool Storage and Watering
Use tool pouches for hands-free carrying. Provide a convenient source of 
water near the garden. Minimize watering chores with drip irrigation (see 
Chapter 15). Install a mailbox near the garden to hold hand tools, gloves, and 
other small items.
Growing Vertically
Grow plants up on trellises chosen to match the height and reach of the gar-
deners. Many flowers and vegetables adapt well to growing vertically (see the 
chapters in Part II, as well as Chapter 12), and you can stick a trellis right in a 
container to keep everything portable.
Keeping It Manageable
Start small, with easy-care plants in small pots — especially for beginner gar-
deners. Choose plants whose mature size fits the spot to minimize pruning 
chores. Look for plants with year-round interest.
Appealing to All the Senses
Include fragrant plants like herbs, plants with soft, fuzzy foliage like lamb’s 
ears, and plants like ornamental grasses that rustle in the breeze. Hang wind 
chimes. Plant brightly colored flowers in contrasting containers for individu-
als with visual impairment.

286
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Bringing the Garden Indoors
Place houseplants where they’re easy to see and care for (see Chapter 14 for 
more on indoor container gardening). Create tabletop gardens accessible on 
all sides. Use pulleys to raise and lower hanging baskets for easy watering.

Cooperative Extension office or visit the clickable map on this Web page:
