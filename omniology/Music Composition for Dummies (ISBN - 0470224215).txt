Dedication
To Irma Jarrett, who along with being a nurturing teacher would have also
been an excellent Jedi knight, but for the fact that for her the Dark Side 
doesn’t exist. — Scott 
To Sherman, Wolfegang, and Astrid, without whose love and support I am
nothing. — Holly
Authors’ Acknowledgments
I would like to express my deeply felt thanks to my 10th-grade English
teacher, Mr. Sims, wherever he may be, for his encouragement. I would also
like to thank Ruth Sweet for introducing me to the effort shapes and their
many uses. Stu Kuby and Louise Messina deserve credit for giving me some
of my first professional music-composition opportunities. My heartfelt grati-
tude goes out to Tom Day, Mike Bogle, and Steve Horlick for their generous
help, support, and resources. And lest I forget from whose well of patience I
drink and whence springs my motivation, I acknowledge my wife, Meg, and
my two sons, Garner and Colin. — Scott
I’d like to thank the amazing musicians whose invaluable advice was essential
to the writing of this book: Jonathan Segel, Genesis P-Orridge, Steve Reich,
Philip Glass, and Mark Mothersbaugh. I’d also like to thank Corbin Collins,
Matt Wagner, and especially my father, Tom Day, for helping make music such
an important part of my life. A special thank you goes to Katherine Tondra,
whose help during the deadline crunches is immensely appreciated. — Holly

Introduction
W
elcome to Music Composition For Dummies!
Are you the type of person who walks around all day with a maddening
melody in your head that makes you stop whatever you’re doing so you can
pay it full attention?
Do you often find yourself tapping out rhythmic passages from these melodies
on your desk at work or scribbling down song lyrics on scraps of paper?
Is music sometimes more of a slave driver to you than a muse?
If you said yes to any of those questions, all we can say is this: We are here 
to help.
About This Book
Music Composition For Dummies contains everything you need to know to get
started
 Picking out the perfect rhythm and tempo for your composition.
 Matching keys and chord progressions to the moods you want to convey.
 Working within the confines of musical form without confining your 
creativity.
 Forcing yourself to sit down and come up with musical ideas, even when
your mind is drawing a complete blank.
In this book, we discuss the basics of composition, from writing natural-
sounding chord progressions and cadences, to composing atonal music, to
making yourself a demo recording and getting it in the hands of the right
people. If there’s any one thing we’ve tried to do here, it’s to demystify the
process of composing music and writing songs.
There are few things more satisfying than plucking a melody from inside your
head and nurturing it into a full-fledged song or even an orchestral piece.
This book will make that process a whole lot easier for you. 

Because each chapter is as self-contained as possible, you don’t have to read
every single chapter to understand what the next one is talking about — unless
you want to, of course.
To find the information you need, you can use the Table of Contents as 
a reference point, or you can just flip through the Index at the back of 
the book. 
Foolish Assumptions
This book is written for many types of budding composers: the classical
music student who never learned how to improvise, the backup musician
who wants to start taking the lead and writing material, and the seasoned
musician who wants to start writing music in genres outside his or her com-
fort zone.
You are probably at least a familiar with playing a musical instrument.
Perhaps you were trained on piano and now want to strike out on your own
and start composing your own music. Maybe you’re a self-taught rock gui-
tarist who wants to learn about composing in other genres. Or perhaps
you’re just a person who has had this maddening tune dancing around in
your head, and you want to figure out how to turn it into a real song.
We do assume that you have at least the rudiments of music theory knowl-
edge. We expect you to know how to read music at least at a basic level, what
chords are, how many beats a whole rest gets in 3/4 time — stuff like that.
Unfortunately, there is not enough room in this book to teach you music
theory, too.
If you’re an absolute newcomer to music, we recommend you first go out and
get yourself a copy of Music Theory For Dummies (Wiley) by Michael Pilhofer
and Holly Day to give yourself a good grounding in the language of music.
Then come back here.
How This Book Is Organized
Music Composition For Dummies is organized into five parts. The first four are
each focused on a particular aspect of music, with the fifth part, the Part of
Tens, containing information about some of the fun aspects of composition
that may have little or nothing to do with actually playing music.

Music Composition For Dummies 

This system makes it easy for you to find what you need to know quickly —
because, after all, this is a reference book, and nobody wants to spend all day
thumbing through pages to find one simple technique.
Part I: Basics and Rhythm
Without rhythm, “music” would be one long, unbroken, unwavering note, and
that would be awfully tricky to dance to. Rhythm is the most basic compo-
nent of any type of music, and being able to use rhythm properly can make or
break a composition. In this section, we discuss the moods you can create by
using different types of rhythm, as well as all the tools you should bring to
the table with you when you first set out to be a composer.
Part II: Melody and Development
Melody is the lead line of the song that stays stuck in your head long after the
song is over. It’s the basic theme running through a piece of music that ties
the whole thing together. In this section, we show you how to build melodic
lines around spoken or written phrases, how to build melodic motives, and
how to use the moods associated with different scales and modes.
Part III: Harmony and Structure
Harmony is the part of a song that fleshes everything out. The proper use of
harmony could turn the melody of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” into a full
orchestral number. In this section, we go over writing harmonic accompani-
ment with existing melodies, composing music with chord progressions,
using effort shapes as compositional tools, understanding basic musical
forms, and getting going in songwriting. 
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement
At the end of the day, your music can’t just sit there looking lonely on paper.
It has to be either played by instruments, or sung, or both. In this chapter, we
discuss the playable ranges of the major instruments of pop ensembles and
the traditional orchestra. We also show you how to write music for pieces
with multiple voices, write music for profit, compose electronic and experi-
mental music, and put together a demo recording of your work.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
Here we introduce you to a few things to do with composition outside of play-
ing music. We profile some fascinating composers without whom this book,
or any other book like it, would not be possible, as well as some additional
music theory and music history books you can pick up to further your educa-
tion on the subject. We also go over some of the most revolutionary periods
of music history that every musician should know about, and discuss why
those periods of music were so important.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are handy little graphic images that are meant to point out particularly
important information. You’ll find the following icons in this book, conve-
niently located along the left margins.
This icon indicates good advice and information that will help you under-
stand key concepts.
When we discuss something that might be problematic or confusing, we use
this icon.
This icon flags information that’s, well, technical, and you can go ahead and
skip it if you want to.
When we make a point or offer some information that we feel you should
keep with you forever, we toss in this icon.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re just starting out as a composer, then go ahead and plow into Part I.
If you’re already familiar with the basics of rhythm and want to start writing
melodies, then head for Part II.

Music Composition For Dummies 

If you’ve already got a hot melody, but want to know how to turn it into a
more full-fledged composition, Part III covers the basics of matching melodies
to harmonies.
Part IV can help you decide what instruments you want to use in your com-
position, or to whom you might want to sell that composition.
It’s important to relax and have fun with this — listening to, playing, and 
writing music are some of the most enjoyable experiences you’ll ever have.
Music Composition For Dummies may have been written by teachers, but we
promise that no clock-watching music instructors will show up at your door
to check on how fast you’re plowing through this book. Composing music is 
a magical, mysterious, wonderful thing. Yet it’s also based on surprisingly
simple principles. In Western music, there are only twelve pitches in each of
eight octaves on the piano, but think of just how different one piece of music
can be from another.
Limits can actually be freeing: Just as with poetry or prose, the more com-
fortable you are working inside a specific form, the greater your ability to
successfully express yourself within that form becomes.

Basics and Rhythm

In this part . . .
W
e tell you what you need to know before you start
seriously composing music — and it’s not just
knowing how to read sheet music, either (you should
already be familiar with that). Everything from a break-
down of music-composing software programs to develop-
ing file-management systems for your compositions is
discussed in this section. We also talk about how impor-
tant rhythm is to creating specific moods in your composi-
tions and discuss how to use rhythmic variations to make
your music more interesting.

Chapter 1
Thinking Like a Composer
In This Chapter
 Finding freedom in restraint
 Joining the ranks of those who create something from nothing
 Getting to know a few rules of composition
 Some things to remember before you get started
M
usic is the one art form that is entirely defined by time. Once a piece of
music is finished being performed, technically, when the last of its
echoes fades, it’s gone. Each piece of music is literally sandwiched in silence,
or external noise, and if your listeners aren’t paying attention, they’re going
to miss it.
Your job, of course, is to make them pay attention.
Limitations as Freedom
Going further, music can be considered to be the sculpting of time. You can
think of your three minutes — or half hour, or 36 hours — as a block waiting
to be chiseled into a specific shape that’s meant to tell a story or convey an
emotion. You just have to figure out which carving technique(s) will work
best to get your particular idea across to your audience.
This is where form comes in. Forms are the specific ways of composing pop
music, classical music, blues music, jazz, country, and even atonal and serial
music. If you know what form you want to compose your song in, part of the
groundwork for your composition is already done for you.

And don’t fret about this “constraining” or “limiting” you. Does the net limit
you in tennis? No, it gives both players something in common to go by. In
music, a form does the same thing: Your listener knows more or less what to
expect, and you know more or less what to give them. The rest — the unique-
ness of your contribution — is up to you. Plus there’s nothing wrong with
combining forms to make new ones. You’ve heard of jazz/rock fusion, porch
punk, country blues, and so on? In fact, you may even find yourself combin-
ing forms without thinking about it.
After choosing a main form, you may want to pick the key you want to write
your piece in. Knowing how the different keys and modes lend themselves to
specific moods is a great help in trying to get a specific emotion across in
your music. And how do you know about keys and moods? By listening to
music written by other people, of course. You have already internalized a lot
of musical mood information, probably without even realizing it.
You may have a melody already bumping around in your head that needs har-
monic accompaniment. You can either plug that melodic line into your
chosen form or start adding some chordal accompaniment and see where it
goes on its own.
There’s no real pre-ordained order in which you should begin composing
music. The end result is all that matters, and if you end up with a piece of
music that you’re even partially satisfied with, then you are on the right
track.
You don’t have to re-invent the wheel. Much of the work in composing music
has already been done for you by others. Instead of re-inventing the wheel,
make your wheel different, more interesting, more unique and truer to what’s
inside you than any other wheels.
Composing as an Extension of Listening
As a music teacher, Johann Sebastian Bach, like other great composers of his
day, trained his students to be not just impressive little robotic pianists, but
to be improvisers and composers. This is something that’s not often taught by
music professors today. Back then, learning how to read scores and perform
other people’s music was not a separate or independent skill from learning
about the creation of music itself. The music of the masters was presented to
students as something to improvise on — and possibly even to improve on. 
10
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

This practical musicality was a comprehensive craft that involved thinking
creatively and realizing it in sound. Music meant more than merely following
instructions. The rote repetition of other people’s music, including Bach’s
own, was used as example and was not the end itself. Students were encour-
aged to alter scores by adding notes, reducing the time value of notes, drop-
ping notes, and changing or adding ornamentation, dynamics, and so on. One
couldn’t even get into Bach’s teaching studio without first showing some
rudimentary composing ability.
If you’re a classically trained music student who has just not had a lot of
opportunities to spread your wings and write your own pieces of music, this
book is especially designed to help you find your own voice, both by drawing
from what you’ve learned in all those years of rote memorization and mining
your own feelings about how music should sound. 
Rules as Inspiration
If you didn’t know better, you might think that music was something that
could start on any note, go wherever it wanted to, and just stop whenever the
performer felt like getting up to get a glass of iced tea. Although it’s true that
many of us have been to musical performances that actually do follow that,
ahem, style of “composition” — for the most part, those performances are
confusing, annoyingly self-indulgent, and feel a little pointless. The only
people that can pull off a spontaneous jam well are those who know music
enough to stack chords and notes next to one another so that they make
sense to listeners. And because music is inherently a form of communication,
connecting with your listeners is an important thing to try to do.
You really need to know the rules before you can break them.
Knowing about song forms, how to meld harmonic lines into a real melody,
and how to end a song on a perfect cadence can be incredibly inspiring. There’s
just no describing the power of the light bulb that goes off in your head when
you suddenly know how to put a 12-bar blues progression together and build
a really good song out of it. The first time you make music with your friends
and find you have the confidence to present your own ideas is thrilling.
It’s our intention that the reader of this book will end up putting his or her
copy down on a regular basis because the urge to try out a new musical tech-
nique is just too hard to resist!
11
Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Composer

You as Your Own Teacher
As with any creative activity, composing music requires that you trust your-
self. An understanding of music theory and a lot of playing skill can be a good
starting point, but what an idea means to you — how it makes you feel and
what you ultimately say with it — can be the only real criterion of its validity.
As you read the following chapters, keep the ideas in this section in mind.
Know what your options are
Once you have an idea, learn how to work it, with methods for (re)harmo-
nization, melodic and rhythmic development, counterparts, variations, and
other compositional techniques. A good composer never stops learning and
can never have too many “tools” in his or her musical toolbox. Learn as many
compositional styles and techniques as possible and try to get an intuitive
grasp on how and when to apply them.
With practice, this information will become second nature — as easy to
summon and use in your compositions as it is for an electrician to pull a
screwdriver or wrench out of his toolbox. A firm, intuitive grasp on music
theory and basic composition and arranging techniques will take your farther
than you can imagine. 
Know the rules
Every form has a set of rules, and as a composer, you should be familiar with
all of them. Rock, folk, classical, and even experimental genres have specific
rules that define them, and knowing those rules is sometimes half the work.
Are rules made to be broken? Sure, sometimes. But they are also made to be
hard-earned guidelines that many, many people before you had to figure out
by trial and error. Use their wisdom for all it’s worth — don’t unthinkingly
discard it.
Pick up more instruments
Each instrument has its own beautiful, specific sound. Sometimes, becoming
halfway fluent on a new instrument can completely change the way you want
12
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

to put music together. It can also expand your appreciation for those other
musicians who will be (we hope) putting your music into action.
Understand when to put something aside
The compositions that cause you persistent, frustrating problems are proba-
bly the ones you need to put away for a later date. Often (but not always), the
best ideas for compositions are the ones that come together naturally, easily,
and quickly. If you’re struggling with a piece of music, sometimes the best
thing you can do is put it away for the day, or even longer, and come back to
it later with a fresh perspective.
Get something from nothing
A great idea is a gift and cannot be produced at will. However, lots of great
composers can do just fine without divine intervention. If you look at many of
J. S. Bach’s compositions, for example, you can see that many sections are
directly technique-inspired, built around very basic melodic lines and musi-
cal ideas.
If you can’t come up with a brilliant start from thin air, then just try to start
with a random one by taking a pen and writing down a series of random
notes. Fill a whole music sheet with random dots and see if there’s anything
interesting. Yes, we’re serious. Or pick up a guitar and play random chords
until something sounds interesting. Or fiddle around on a keyboard until
something makes your ears perk up. Countless classic pieces of music have
begun with little more than these simple techniques.
Once you have a bit of something you want to explore, you can use rules to
help you. It may sound corny, but it’s true: The biggest oak began as a tiny
acorn. The chapters in this book can show you how to fill out the melodic
line you’ve just created as well as build a harmonic accompaniment.
Trust your own taste
If you like it, someone else will too. Composing music is about self-expression,
and if you’ve written a piece of music that sounds wonderful to you, then by
all means, go with your gut. As beautiful and unique as all members of the
human race are, there are more similarities between us than differences.
13
Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Composer

On the other hand, even if what you’ve written doesn’t follow any set of rules,
and even if most people who hear it hate it, if you love it, it’s worth keeping.
Eventually you’ll bump into other people who will truly get it, and you’ll be
happy you saved that one odd bit of music that everyone else thought was
unlistenable.
We mentioned a composer’s toolkit. In the next chapter, you start building
yours.

Chapter 2
Tools of the Trade
In This Chapter
 Writing music by hand
 Composing on an instrument
 Using software to help you write music
 Training your ears
 Understanding the importance of music theory
 Finding the space, time, and ideas to compose
Just as electricians, plumbers, and mechanics use toolboxes to organize
their tools, composers also bring toolboxes with them to work. The differ-
ence is, of course, that the aforementioned tradespeople’s toolboxes can be
seen, felt, and tripped over in the dark, whereas the composer’s toolbox is
contained mostly within his or her mind. 
But they are still tools, and you need to use and develop them if you are
going to get very far composing music. If you could open up a typical com-
poser’s toolbox and take a peek inside, you would find the tools covered in
this chapter within. 
The Ability to Compose 
with Pencil and Paper
Believe it or not, even in this computerized world there are still many situa-
tions where a sheet of paper and a pencil are the best tools for the music
composer. Many important modern composers, especially those born before
1940, won’t work with anything but paper and pencil. So, never think you are
too advanced for these humble tools.

Writing music with only paper and pencil has some amazing advantages to
composing at a piano or other instrument. For one thing, many composers
find the actual sound of the instrument itself interruptive to the composition
process. Just imagine yourself deep in thought, hearing the perfect sequence
of notes in your head, when suddenly, your finger touches the actual piano
key, and it doesn’t sound exactly like you imagined. Real sound is jarring, and
hearing even the first note of your imagined phrase before you’ve written it
down can cause you to lose an entire piece of music.
Conversely, many musicians work directly on their instrument of choice, usu-
ally a piano or guitar, and simply jot down their musical ideas on paper while
composing. The ability to work with pencil and paper comes in especially
handy in this context — you don’t have to wait for a computer to boot up,
and you don’t have to compose solely in the same room as your computer.
Computers can’t be beaten for neatness when you need a printed score (writ-
ten music for all the instruments that play a piece of music), a part (written
music for just one instrument, extracted from a score), or lead sheet (written
music using chord charts and a melodic line) — but you can take a pencil and
paper anywhere.
In order for the pencil and paper to be useful, though, you have to be able to
translate what you hear in your head into music notation. A good knowledge
of solfege (the basic system of do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, in which each syllable
represents a note on the major scale), or the numeric system of melodic rep-
resentation (Do is 1, Re is 2, and so on) is essential. 
If you aren’t fluent enough in your head with different keys, you can write
everything out in the key of C and transpose it to a different key later, proba-
bly on the computer.
Pencil and paper are often useful to just jot a rhythmic idea down quickly.
This can be done on any type of paper; notation paper is not necessary —
you can even just write X’s for note heads and draw in the measure lines. 
When using a pencil and paper, be sure to have a good eraser on hand, too. 
Performance Skills
Most composers use a keyboard or guitar to compose on, but you can use
any instrument you’re comfortable with. Although most composers are profi-
cient instrumentalists, some composers actually do it all in their heads. 
At any rate, being able to play melodies and chords on an instrument is a def-
inite plus. The piano with its 88 keys encompasses the ranges of all other
16
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

orchestral instruments, so it is traditionally the best choice. An electronic
keyboard hooked into the right computer program (see next section) can
provide a broad sound palette that can give the composer a rough idea of
what a composition might sound like later played on real instruments. Keep
in mind that a violin, for instance, played with a bow, can never really be
accurately portrayed by a violin sample coming out of a keyboard.
Some skill at playing, plus the easy availability of an instrument, is almost
essential for a music composer. The first time Scott wrote music for orches-
tral instruments, he had only enough skill on the piano to play two or three
parts together at the same time, so he had to play the oboe part with the
French horn part, and then the French horn with the trumpet, and so on. He
never actually heard all the notes played together until he was in the record-
ing studio in front of the orchestra. Exhilarating? Yes. Scary? You bet!
Composition Software
It is impossible to overstate the important role of computers in music compo-
sition today. The following are some ways computers are involved in compos-
ing music today. Computers
 Provide various sounds to work with.
 Print out your parts quickly and neatly.
 Help you organize your ideas.
 Fit music to film easily.
 Provide tools for piecing together entire compositions while enabling
you to test out ideas before committing to them.
 Can even produce and deliver a final recording of your work, if you use a
good composition program.
As we mentioned, many great music composers out there do not use com-
puters at all in their work, whereas others would be completely lost without
computers.
So where do computers fit into your musical world? Ask yourself a few 
questions:
 Are you computer savvy?
 Do you have access to a fairly late-model computer?
 Can you get around the operating system?
17
Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade

 Do you understand the basics of file management?
 Have you had success learning other computer programs before?
If you answered yes to most of these, then you will probably do all right, as
long as you don’t pick the wrong software for the job.
In this section we briefly discuss a few major industry software packages,
focusing on what each is good for and not good for.
Finale 
www.finalemusic.com
Finale is a music notation, scoring, layout, and publishing program. It is 
probably the most popular choice for bringing musical ideas into print. The
program does enable you to audition your ideas with traditional orchestral
sounds, but it is mostly used to print scores and parts. It does this very well,
and many music programs in colleges and universities are now requiring the
study of this program. Finale 2007 runs approximately $350.
Sibelius
www.sibelius.com
Sibelius is a competitive program to Finale. It has better playback features for
hearing scores that you’ve just input than Finale, but is less straightforward
to navigate through. It is largely a matter of personal taste which of these two
programs suits your writing style better. Sibelius 5 Pro Edition runs approxi-
mately $600.
Pro Tools
www.digidesign.com
Pro Tools is found in almost every recording studio in the U.S. It is primar-
ily designed for recording and editing audio tracks, though the last few 
versions of Pro Tools have included access to sample players and synthesiz-
ers through its MIDI capabilities. Pro Tools includes some integration with
Sibelius, and the compositional side of Pro Tools is likely to expand more in
18
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

the future. At present, it doesn’t offer a lot in the way of compositional tools.
Pro Tools is said to be unparalleled for cutting, pasting, and otherwise pro-
cessing audio recordings. Pro Tools LE runs approximately $500.
Logic Pro
www.apple.com/logicpro
Apple’s Logic Pro is a complex and very deep program that aspires to be
everything in one package. It offers sophisticated notation, scoring, layout,
and printing tools, audio recording and editing capabilities, MIDI production
with sample and synthesizer plug-ins, excellent cut-and-paste arranging and
compositional tools, and more. You can even burn CDs and create MP3 and
AAC audio files right in the program.
Logic Pro has a fairly steep learning curve, but most people who have tackled
it find it is worth it. It is a popular program for electronic composition, sound
design, and music composition for film and video — and is as popular in the
studios of Europe as Pro Tools is in the U.S. Many of the notated figures in
this book were created in Logic Pro. At the time of this writing, Logic Pro is
only available for Macintosh computers. And it’s not cheap: Apple Logic Pro
7.2 runs around $1000.
Cubase
www.steinberg.net
Cubase is similar to Logic Pro, though with less power in the scoring printout
area and fewer compositional features. Cubase is easier to learn than Logic
Pro, though, and it’s available for Mac and Windows machines. Cubase 4 runs
approximately $1000.
If you are already using a music-composition program and feel comfortable
with it, there’s no real reason to change your routine. However, if you’re 
planning on moving your work around a lot from place to place or studio to
studio, you might start learning how to use Pro Tools, especially if you’re
doing a lot of audio recording of performances. If you’re also doing sound
design or electronic composition, need music printed out, or if you work with
loops (repeated samples or recorded sounds that run through part or all of a
composition) in addition to working with audio recordings of performances,
Logic Pro may be your best bet.

A Pair of Moderately Well-Trained Ears
When you think about it, we don’t really “train” our ears at all. We develop 
listening skills and, therefore, develop our communication skills. We do this
by training our brains to exercise a more focused type of attention on the
stimuli arriving at our ears. It’s just like when you’re learning to speak a for-
eign language — you learn to pick out familiar words and phrases spoken in
that new language and build your vocabulary from there. Music is as much a
language as Mandarin or English or Swahili, and it just takes time, patience,
and good listening skills to understand its “words.” You probably won’t pick
it up instantly, but with perseverance, you will pick it up. 
There are a lot of good courses available for developing good musical listen-
ing skills. If you’re the self-teaching type, sitting in front of a piano and hitting
notes over and over until you can identify pitches by ear is a good way to
start.
Very few of us are born with perfect pitch, but most people can become able
to identify intervals (the difference in pitch) between two or three notes and
can pick those notes out on the piano without much trouble. With practice,
the same person can learn to pick out simple phrases and chords on the
piano and therefore learn how other composers put their songs together.
What we’re saying here is that being one of the gifted few with perfect pitch
isn’t critical to being a good composer. With a set of moderately well-trained
ears, you can learn to play and compose just about anything. 
Knowledge of Music Theory 
It is important to be able to communicate your musical ideas to others.
That’s why you want to compose music in the first place, right? Part of this
communication is being able to define the music you hear in terms that
others can understand. Music theory is the study of music and the way it
works and it encompasses the language through which musicians communi-
cate their musical ideas to one another. 
We assume that if you’re ready to compose, you can already at least read
music. With practice, you should be comfortable enough reading music 
that you can hear the notes in your head as you read them on the page. Have
you ever seen someone reading a piece of music aloud to themselves, often
humming loudly as they work their way through a piece? That’s the level of
comfort you should aim for — being able to “hear” a song just by looking at a
lead sheet or a section of sheet music. 
20
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

If you are weak in the music theory department, we recommend that you
read Music Theory For Dummies by Holly Day and Michael Pilhofer (Wiley).
Space, Time, and Ideas
The rhythmic beatings and messages that we get from the sounds around 
us in everyday life strongly influence the music that we compose. To a city
dweller, a bird song is a signal from a world beyond the din of street noise. 
To a more rural ear, the sound of a jet flying by is also a signal from another
world. Such influences affect the making of our inner music. The background
of a song, either supporting or contrasting a theme, is what commands our
attention. The best music is about a place, time, mood, setting, or vibe 
that offers a silver string of melody and throbs with the rhythmic urgency 
of our lives.
Engaging in musical composition often requires silence. Silence is the con-
tainer of musical imagination. Your best melodic and rhythmic ideas may
come to you amidst the hustle and bustle of life, but if you can’t find a quiet
place and time to spend nurturing these ideas, they will bear little fruit.
A Pack Rat Mentality
Keep everything. Tape everything. Whether you compose with pencil and
paper or on a computer, or just hum lines into a portable tape recorder while
you’re out for a walk, it is essential that you try to keep all the little begin-
nings, endings, chord progressions, melodies, grooves, and musical ideas of
all shapes and sizes on file somewhere. A melody that leads to a dead end
today may inspire you next year. A dumb little ditty that you have rolling
around in your brain may not be your next masterpiece, but it might work
great for a TV or radio jingle. 
Many great composers disliked the very works that earned them notoriety.
Bizet hated Carmen, for example. And maybe fame and fortune aren’t all
they’re cracked up to be, but along with them comes the freedom to continue
to pursue the craft of music composition. To a musician, money equals time,
meaning that the more money you’ve got coming in, the more time you can
spend working on the music you truly love to write. So don’t be so quick to
condemn your “unfinished” works. Just know how to recognize when a par-
ticular musical idea isn’t working and don’t try to force pieces of a puzzle to
fit together. If something doesn’t work, put it away and save it for a rainy day.

here are not a whole lot of things worse than coming up with a great
melody line, or even the beginnings of a great song, only to forget what
you came up with simply because you didn’t write it down.
You may think you’ve got a great memory for music, especially your own, but
if you don’t find some way to write down those notes or record that riff,
there’s a very good chance that the last time you hear that brand new music
might be the first and only time you play it.
To avoid this kind of heartbreak and potential tragic loss for humanity, get 
in the habit of getting every idea you ever have down somehow — recorded,
written, typed, whatever. This is so important we are dedicating this chapter
to it.
Writing It Down 
There’s an easy way to keep from losing those beautiful moments of inspira-
tion, and that is to keep a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with you at all
times. It only takes a few seconds to write down that engaging little melody
or riff that’s been banging around in your head.

Keep a pad and pencil by your bed, too, in case you wake up inspired and
need to write down something quick. 
When composing by hand the old-fashioned way, a good mechanical pencil
with a good eraser is a must. A mechanical pencil — one of those with the
clicky thing at the end that pushes the lead through the tip — is perfect
because it ensures that your note stems, heads, and so forth will all be a con-
sistent size. Use a pencil with larger diameter leads, at least 0.5 mm and up to
0.7 mm. You will find it easier to fill in note heads, and the tip won’t break off
quite as often. Have a standalone eraser nearby as well. Usually the areas to
be erased are larger than the areas to be rewritten. 
You can probably buy staff paper at your local music store by the sheet, note-
book, or even by 500-page ream. If not, order through online bookstores like
Amazon or download printable PDFs from many free music Web sites, includ-
ing www.incompetech.com and www.blanksheetmusic.net.
Using Software
Printed music these days is made, as mentioned in Chapter 2, with the aid of
computer music scoring/notation/composition programs such as Sibelius,
Finale, and Logic. Even a simple chord chart can quickly and neatly be printed
out with these programs. After years of working with nearly illegible hand-
written charts, almost everyone is happy about this development. Most of
the figures in this book were created in Logic and Finale.
In college music courses, learning your way around these computer pro-
grams is often part of the required curriculum. Understanding one of these
programs can aid tremendously in the generation of scores and parts. 
Within these computer programs, you have the option of playing your music
into the computer with a MIDI controller (and a metronome to keep you in
time) or entering the notes with a mouse or keyboard. The MIDI controller is
usually a keyboard, but you can use guitar, drums, woodwind, and even vibes
MIDI controllers if you are more at home with one of these. 
The important thing is to get your tune into the machine. You can edit your
music within the program later, if need be. Notes can be moved around,
deleted, copied, pasted, lengthened, shortened, and otherwise ornamented.
You can add or enharmonically change accidentals. Your work can be audi-
tioned within the program using the sound libraries that are included in most
packages, and you can easily transpose into any key. The printout can be for-
matted in various ways and with various styles, including guitar tablature.
24
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

Making your lyrics conform to note positions is simple. You can even extract
chord symbols and put them on the printout. Speaking of printing, you can
print out an entire score, individual parts, or even just a small bit of something
from your screen (as we have done frequently for the figures in this book).
In short, these computer applications are very sophisticated music notation
processors, much as Microsoft Word is a sophisticated word processor. An
expert with Finale can pretty much type his or her music into the computer.
Using these programs means you don’t have to carry around a ream of sheet
music, or even a notebook, for making notes about ongoing compositions.
(Instead, you may be carrying a laptop computer.) With music notation soft-
ware, the music you play on your instrument has already been automatically
notated, from the barest melody line to the rhythm track you beat out during
warmup.
You can erase the things you don’t want to use, of course, but the little 
unfinished gems that come to you while fooling around can now be saved,
instantly, for use in the future. A good rule of thumb is if you’re in doubt, 
save it.
Having a large cache of little musical bits to listen to and draw on for inspira-
tion is so much better than having no unfinished music at all. Besides, you
never know when someone will want ten seconds of music from you for tele-
vision filler music, a videogame sound effect, or even a ringtone. 
Computer versus Paper and Pencil
Of course, even in the computer age there is still no replacement for an
actual printed copy of your work. Print everything and keep a file folder of
the printed paper copies of any of your work that actually gets recorded or
performed. With the speed at which technology advances there is no telling
what sort of computer applications and storage media we will be using in five
or ten years. Retrieving data from the sorts of media we use today could
become difficult in the future. It has already become difficult in many cases to
retrieve work that was saved on floppy disk, ADAT, and DAT tapes. And have
you noticed that good quality audio cassette players are becoming scarce?
Despite the overwhelming advance of computer technology into the world of
music composition, there are still advantages to working with pencil and
paper. Pencil and paper are cheap and can be taken anywhere. At the beach
or in a kayak are not great places for computers. And they don’t need to be
plugged in or charged up. If you are skilled at transcribing the music in your
25
Chapter 3: Musical Scrapbooks: Writing on Paper and Screen

head into music notation, you may not need all of the automatic help that
you get from a computer during the early, creative phases of your composi-
tion. You might still want the power of making your work legible enough for
anyone to read, and you may want to publish your work, so the computer will
come in handy later — but there is something freeing about working with
simple, primitive tools. The process of writing becomes more direct without
the distractions of a computer environment to confront you.
Some composers feel more comfortable with the light reflecting off of a piece
of paper than by the light transmitted through a computer monitor. You may
also find it easier to navigate through a pile of papers than click through the
pages onscreen.
Few things in life are more rewarding than sitting out on your porch on a
sunny spring day with a book of staff paper and a pencil, writing down what-
ever comes to your imagination. Try it.
File Management
One of the dangers of working solely in the computer realm is that important
pieces of music might get lost if you aren’t careful with file management.
Sometimes it is hard to say which pieces of music are going to end up being
important ones, so we offer some tips here about file management.
To start with, let’s define file management as the organization and logical
arrangement of hierarchical structure in various data storage media, such as
hard drives, CDs and DVDs, file folders, and files used for your work. More
simply: It’s where you keep stuff in your computer.
It is a good idea to keep all your computer applications on your boot drive,
but storing your music on the same drive can end up being a very bad idea.
Fragmentation can occur or you could just run out of space. Moreover, if the
drive crashes (which it will, sooner or later) you could easily reinstall your
applications, but your work could be lost forever. To prevent this from hap-
pening, you should probably get an extra, external hard drive and dedicate it
to your saved music files. They are not so expensive anymore; you can proba-
bly find a perfectly good one for $75 or so.
Start by creating a folder on your drive called My Compositions, or some-
thing like that, and create organizational folders within that folder. They
could be named for the different styles of music you are working with: Rock,
Jazz, and so on. Or you could organize your work using folder names like
Jingles, Film Scores, and Songs.
26
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

Inside these folders you should create a folder for each group of composi-
tions that belong to a particular project or client. For example, in a folder
named Productions, there could be a folder named Albums, in which there is
a folder named The Gift of Thirst, inside which there is a folder for each song
from that album.
If this seems like a lot of work, you have probably never lost anything on your
computer — yet! It just takes one time to lose years of work. And then you’ll
be kicking yourself for not having taken advice like we’re giving here. And you
won’t be just gently kicking yourself, either.
Frequently making a backup of your work is a must. You can do this by
having yet another hard drive, and copying your work across to it from time
to time. Or you can burn your work onto a DVD-R or CD-R disc from time to
time. These hard media copies are not subject to mechanical breakdowns,
though they can get scratched into uselessness if you don’t treat them with
care. To be really safe, make an extra copy every once in a while and take it
to work or give it to a neighbor.
27
Chapter 3: Musical Scrapbooks: Writing on Paper and Screen
Electronic versus “real” Instruments
Some composers feel that auditioning compo-
sitional ideas using the synthesized or sampled
sounds inside a computer is a bad idea. It can
steer a composer’s editing choices away from
the capabilities of musicians and toward what
seems to work with the particular sound you are
listening to at the moment. These composers
feel that many good ideas get tossed out this
way. For them, a better choice is to present the
parts to musicians and meet the challenges
then, with the input of the musicians who have
to play the parts.
Hearing your music played by real musicians
first is a decidedly different experience than
testing and editing your music with computer
sounds and then giving it to real musicians. You
still have a lot of work to do when the musicians
finally get ahold of your music.
Nothing ever quite plays exactly the way you
think it will, so always be ready for compro-
mises, rewrites, and other surprises. When the
musicians are trying to play your piece for the
first time, you are obliged to radiate a sense of
confidence about what you are going for, and
an ability to be fast and flexible with your edits
and changes.

T
ake a few minutes to listen to the rhythms around you. Is a bird singing?
A train rattling by? Is someone hammering something down the block?
You may notice the repetitive sounds of your tires as you drive over a bridge,
your footsteps as you walk or run, the cash register tapping out its tune.
There are even rhythms from within: the sound of your breathing, your heart-
beat. Life is full of rhythm if you’re paying attention. 
The rhythms of life have always influenced composers, both consciously and
subconsciously. During the era when people regularly made long trips in horse-
drawn carriages, quite a lot of music was written with a trotting or cantering
rhythm. It’s easy to imagine being a bored composer on a long trip through
England when suddenly, your next composition pops into your head, spurred
on by the relentless, rhythmic hoof-falls of the horses pulling your buggy. 
The same types of influences are around us today. It’s not such a big stretch
to hear the clanging of assembly-line machinery when listening to industrial
music. Obviously, rap music wasn’t invented by cattle ranchers languidly fol-
lowing a herd along the trail, and there’s no way you can listen to rap and
think that there was any such connection. You can, however, hear the color-
ful banter of urban neighborhood streets in rap music, and you can easily feel
the sway of a horse’s walk in traditional country and western ballads.

In short, different rhythms convey different moods, and learning how to
corner and manipulate those rhythms is the first step to getting your musical
ideas across to another person. 
Sculpting Time into Music
A composition can be thought of as the sculpting of time.
Time is relative. Einstein once explained his concept of relativity by saying,
“When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit
on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour.”
Rhythm is a large part of music’s ability to sculpt time and produce different
moods. The right rhythm can sculpt a five-minute piece of time to convey a
sense of urgency and hurriedness — or to make the listener feel laid back and
relaxed. These are examples of the mood messages that can result from
rhythmic choices in music composition.
Let’s say you’re scoring a film. You wouldn’t use a slow, pensive, loping
rhythm to score a crowded party or a parade scene, and you wouldn’t even
think about an exciting 2/4 march for a funeral scene — unless, of course,
your intention was to create an unnatural mood or feeling. Just like how your
heart beats faster when you’re happy or excited, lively rhythms to lively
scenes just make sense. In music, lively rhythms convey a happy, excited, or
just plain agitated sense, whereas slower rhythms can’t help but invoke feel-
ings of somberness, sadness, or even drowsiness.
Rhythm in music is more than just a regular, clocklike pulse chosen at
random. When used wisely, it can set the tone of your composition and
convey moods and mood changes throughout a composition. 
The Feel of Different Rhythms
Look at the following list of moods or emotions and try to decide the general
tempo (the speed or pace of the underlying pulse) that might best convey
these moods. There are no wrong answers, and you can just say “fast” or
“slow” for now, although there is a fairly sophisticated musical language for
different tempos.
 Fear
 Anticipation
30
Part I: Basics and Rhythm 

 Sorrow
 Joy
 Anger
 Love
 Hate
 Compassion
 Surprise
 Tenderness
 Anxiety
As we said, there are no right and wrong answers. One reason for this is that
emotions and moods can have variations within themselves. For example, fear
can have a fast rhythm or a slow rhythm, with the “fast” fear being more flight-
oriented, and the “slow” fear being more dread-oriented or suspense-oriented.
However, in general, the way these moods broadly affect your bodily func-
tions is pretty universal. Surprise gets your heart rate up, whereas sorrow
slows it down. It’s a known fact that the rhythms of music can affect your
heart rate and other bodily functions. Have you ever been to a rave or dance
club? The DJ uses the rhythms of each song to adjust the heart rates of the
dancers like so many metronomes and thereby manipulates the emotions of a
whole crowd up and down over the course of the evening. 
But there is more to rhythm than tempo alone. Have you ever noticed that
there is a difference in the feel of walking and skipping? Walking is quite regu-
lar and even: Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop. Figure 4-1 shows how the rhythm of
walking looks on a musical staff.
Skipping, on the other hand, has an uneven groove (Figure 4-2), with two
steps close together and then a pause. Da, da-da, da-da, da-da.

Chapter 4: Rhythm and Mood

If your friend walks at a rate of one step per second and you skip at the same
rate, you could call these two rhythms variations. You are both moving at the
same tempo, but the feel of the rhythm is different. Sometimes we use the
term mood message to describe the feel of a rhythm. What is the difference in
the mood messages of walking and skipping?

Part I: Basics and Rhythm 
Using a metronome
For many composers, exact metronome settings
are critical for setting the groove and the mood
of the piece. Today’s computer music work-
stations provide a great deal of precision in this
area, with many of them offering click-track (a
virtual metronome you hear through head-
phones) settings down to the ten-thousandth of
a beat per minute (abbreviated bpm, also some-
times called MM).
Such precision comes in particularly handy
when you’re trying to fit a particular musical
mood to a set length of film or video. That piece
of music you composed at 92 bpm (or MM-92)
may need to be changed to 90.785 bpm in order
to fit the length of the scene exactly. Another
thing to consider is that, if you are working with
a singer, the lyrics have to be allowed to flow
naturally —— even if the musicians might enjoy
playing the music at a faster or slower tempo.
Terms for ranges of metronomic tempo were
established long ago and are still used today.
You will undoubtedly encounter them in sheet
music. They are Italian words, and the following
are a few of the more common ones:
Largo: 40 to 60 beats per minute
Larghetto: 60 to 66 beats per minute
Adagio: 66 to 76 beats per minute
Andante: 76 to 108 beats per minute 
Allegro: 108 to 168 beats per minute
Presto: 168 to 200 beats per minute
And once you have decided on a tempo, you
have to determine the meter of your piece. In
other words, how many beats will be contained
in each measure, and what type of note —
quarter, eighth, and so on — will be counted as
a single beat. This choice is represented as a
time signature (4/4, 3/4, 6/8, and so on). It is a lot
easier for musicians to count up to three over
and over again than it is for them to count each
beat in a piece of music separately. Besides
this, it seems that rhythms in life tend to work in
simple repeated patterns like the beating of
your heart or the rhythm of walking.

The point here is that it can be useful to start a composition by choosing the
mood you want the piece of music to convey and matching it up with a
rhythm that is appropriate. When you’re starting from the rhythm up — a
very common way to compose music — choosing the best tempo for the job
is half the work. 
You want your composition to tell a story. And, just as a story contains pas-
sages of contentment, change, tension, crisis, and resolution, for example, so
the mood needs to change at some point within the music. You can change
and vary the tempo (mood) to fit that mood change. You can use rhythm to
create contrast, conflict, development, resolution, and other story-building
components.
Speed Bumps and Rhythmic Phrases
A composition traveling along at a set meter and tempo can get boring or
even exhausting after awhile. That’s another reason why it’s a good idea to
break up the rhythmic landscape with a few bumps along the way — to keep
things interesting or keep your listener awake.
Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” offers a familiar example of varying the rhythmic
landscape in order to throw things off a little bit (Figure 4-3).
At the end of the twelfth measure, after a section of mostly straight quarter
notes, he surprises the listener by putting a strong accent — unexpectedly —
on beat four. Beat four is usually a weak pulse, but the German genius makes
it strong by starting a phrase there, and then makes it even stronger by tying
the note over into beat one of the following measure. Beat one is usually
expected to be a strong beat. The result almost feels like you were walking

along and then slipped on a patch of ice, yet managed somehow able to hold
on and continue with an unbroken stride.
This technique of putting a strong accent on a beat that is usually weak (an
up-beat, for example) is called syncopation, and can be applied to a single
note, a group of notes, or an entire melody. 
Breaking up the rhythm is an excellent way to hold the listener’s attention,
and it may provide opportunities later on for different instrumentation
choices and arrangement ideas when you start to flesh out your composition.
Figure 4-4 shows another section of “Ode to Joy” in which Beethoven “skips”
with the same melody he “walked” with earlier in Figure 4-3. 
Beyond the steady persistence of the underlying tempo of your composition,
there are brief sections of music called rhythmic phrases. Think of the old
“Shave and a Haircut” ditty (it’s actually a couplet), the rhythm of which is
shown in Figure 4-5.

You don’t even need the melody for the rhythmic phrase in Figure 4-5 to be
immediately recognized. In fact, if you knock the first five notes out on your
desktop at school or work, someone is bound to finish it for you. The rhythm
suggests the melody, shown in Figure 4-6. 
This is an important idea: A simple rhythmic phrase can suggest melodies. It
can also, therefore, render some melodies unsuitable.
Mixing It Up: Back Phrasing, Front
Phrasing, and Syncopation
There are a few ways to change up the rhythm of your composition.
Back phrasing
Let’s have some fun by pushing the phrasing of “Shave and a Haircut” out by
one beat. Our result looks like Figure 4-7.

Chapter 4: Rhythm and Mood

When you move your music phrase later in the measure, so that the melody
starts after the beat, it’s called back phrasing. As you can tell from Figure 4-7,
our song now starts on beat two, with a rest on beat one. Try it out! Make
sure you are playing or singing this with the strong accent, as usual, on the
first beat of the measure. ONE two ONE two. Back phrasing can be a tricky
thing to get a handle on, so if a natural-sounding rhythm eludes you the first
couple of times, that’s okay. You see how it changes the song?
Front phrasing
If we go the other way and front phrase it — or move the melody forward by
one beat — the result looks like Figure 4-8.
Now, going back to tempo for a second, try playing or singing these varia-
tions at a very fast or ridiculously slow tempo, just to see what those changes
do to the overall feel of the song. Bet you never thought that “Shave and a
Haircut” could sound so spooky! It’s funny how even slight changes in tempo
can change the mood of a song so much. 
Let’s try to do a skipping variation of the back-phrased version of “Shave and
a Haircut” (Figure 4-9).
Bear with us for one more example as we now syncopate the original melody
(Figure 4-10).

Syncopation
Notice in Figure 4-10 how the “syllabic emphasis” is not where the strong nat-
ural beats are. Syncopation is basically about putting the emphasis on the
wrong syllable. That doesn’t mean it’s “wrong,” though. Syncopation just
makes things a bit different, surprising, and spicy. In short, it’s a good way 
to break up the rhythmic landscape and thereby change the mood of your
composition.
If you were counting out just the rhythm from Figure 4-10, you would get
something like the following:
one-AND two-and THREE-and four-AND one-and two-AND three-AND 
four-and 
As you can guess from all the examples, a composer could nearly build an
entire composition around “Shave and a Haircut” — with just a few minor
variations, we might not even know it. Depending on the accompaniment,
tempo, musical context, and any number of other variables, “Shave and a
Haircut” could completely escape our notice in a composition.
Using familiar themes in new ways is incredibly common in composition.
There’s nothing new under the sun — only a lot of old stuff, being used in
new ways. A composer could, if he or she wanted to, throw a lot of old, stale,
familiar little chestnuts at his or her listeners without their even realizing it.
Don’t be afraid of trying out some variations of a strong rhythmic phrase or
theme by offsetting the starting point of the phrase in time or using syncopa-
tion to spice it up.
By the way, such rhythmic tinkering is easily done in music software (such as
Logic Pro) by just creating or even copying someone else’s phrase or theme
and dragging it around a little. (See Chapter 2 for more on music software.)
On paper, it’s a matter of visualizing and auralizing the newly displaced
nugget of your rhythmic ingenuity.

Finding Your Own Rhythmic Phrases
Although it’s possible to build your entire arsenal of musical compositions on
variations of the “Shave and a Haircut” riff, it’s so much more fun and satisfy-
ing to come up with your own rhythmic phrases to build songs around. So
where can we get these rhythmic phrases? Everywhere — there’s one right
there, in the last sentence (Figure 4-11).
What kind of melody would the rhythm in Figure 4-11 suggest or reject?
It has been said that music is a universal language, but even rhythms on their
own, without a melody, are capable of universal communication. Think of 
the talking drums in West African culture, which seem to mimic the human
voice — or the tablas of India with their huge vocabulary of variable sounds.
Though we all speak different languages, all languages have rhythms and
melodies in them. So perhaps we should say instead that language univer-
sally uses the elements of music to communicate.
For now, start paying attention to the tempos and rhythmic phrases present
all around you. They will contribute much to your musical compositions,
whether you want them to or not.

rhythm when it starts in the morning. Maybe your dog barks in a rhyth-
mic pattern. Maybe someone is hammering down the street or your door
or mailbox makes a rhythmic creaking noise. Whatever it is, if it has
rhythm, you can use it in your composition.
2. Notice the tempo of your walking.
Most people settle into a habitual pace when they walk. Try to change it
up today. Go a little faster or slower and see how that feels. Try to feel
the upbeats between your footsteps as you walk. What kind of melody
suggests itself when you listen to the rhythm of your walk?
3. Notice the unconscious rhythms of human interactions.
Notice the rhythm of conversation while you are chatting with friends,
for example. Most activities have a generally accepted “normal” pace
that we almost always adhere to. How do you feel when someone moves
too slow or too fast for the circumstances? What makes you slow your
pace or speed it up? And most importantly, how can these things be
incorporated into your music?
4. Write or copy three short sentences and notate their rhythms.
Is the meter of the sentence four beats to a measure or three? Where 
are the accents? Which syllables move the melody up and which move 
it down?
5. Analyze several of your favorite songs or compositions.
Can you find rhythmic phrases that recur? How many variations can you
find of the same phrase? How many different phrases were used? How
do the rhythmic phrases interact with the melody choices?
6. Pick a rhythmic phrase from these exercises that you would like to
develop for future use.

W
hat exactly is a melody? Or, from a composer’s standpoint, perhaps a
more important question is: Why do you need one (or several)?
Where can you find them? 
To answer the first question, putting it very, very simply: A melody is a suc-
cession of notes built on a musical framework.
A melody is probably the most important part of a composition. It’s the lead
line you find yourself humming after hearing a song, and it’s the part of a
song that seems to be the hardest to get out of your head. 
Sounds simple enough. Maybe too simple, but it’s a good start. 
What Is a Musical Framework?
Obviously, throwing a random succession of notes together will almost cer-
tainly not produce a good melody. Yet many successful compositions might
sound to many listeners as though that’s just what the composer did. And
believe it or not, there are tools available in several computer programs that
will do just that — randomize notes into musical phrases (see Chapter 2 for a
brief survey of music software).

Anyone, with or without the help of technology, can come up with a succes-
sion of notes. But what makes a good melody? And just what do we mean by a
musical framework?
For one thing, a musical framework is the duration of a particular section of
your composition. Or to be more abstract: A musical framework is the amount
of time during which you are hoping to secure the attention of your listeners.
Because music is the sculpting of time, without a framework of some kind,
you don’t have music. Many times when you are composing, the melody itself
creates or even demands a framework to grow around it. Even a lonely, soli-
tary melody has a little rhythm built into it. (The other elements of the musi-
cal framework are the chords and instrumentation that you have chosen,
which we talk about in Part III.)
Now, where do you find melodies to go into this framework?
Finding Melody in Language
If you are ever in need of inspiration, try slipping a tape recorder in your
pocket and heading out into the street. Go into a cafe or get on the bus, turn
on your tape recorder, and just let the din of the other passengers’ voices
wash over you. You don’t even have to listen to the tape afterwards — often-
times, just being an active listener can be enough to get you started in learn-
ing to pay attention to the music of language.
There is so much to get from the way a person talks. Consider the rhythm of
a speaker’s voice — is it clumsy, staccato, languid? What about the quality of
a voice — high-pitched, low-pitched, childish, aggressive? Each person is a
self-playing instrument. Put two or more people together, and you’ve got the
most basic orchestra. 
Take another look at the example of finding the rhythmic phrase in speech
from Chapter 4 (Figure 5-1).

Part II: Melody and Development 

Looking at Figure 5-1, let’s see what kind of melody is suggested by this
phrase. When you speak the phrase out loud, notice that some of the words
rise upward in pitch, while others go down in pitch. There might be some
variation in emphasis or intention when different people say the phrase, but
by and large these words almost demand a natural melodic movement, some-
thing like that shown in Figure 5-2.
All well and good. Now try speaking the phrase with an unnatural melodic
movement, something like the one shown in Figure 5-3.
Now the phrase doesn’t work musically. The melody of it is off somehow. Or
is it the rhythmic emphasis? See how important the elements of music are to
basic spoken communications? It’s fairly easy to determine the direction that
the melody wants to move in this example — and a direction where it doesn’t.
We can see the basic landscape, given this phrase.

Chapter 5: Finding Melodies Where You Least Expect Them

But where will we find the exact notes to give to our melody? One way would
be to limit ourselves to the notes within a particular scale. In our examples,
we’ve stuck to the key of C major and used notes that we know make musical
sense together — that is, notes from the C major scale. So, using notes from
the major scale is one very common method of finding notes. 
Let’s Eat(,) Grandma!
It’s fun and instructive to see how meanings can totally change depending
solely on your melodic choices. Figure 5-4 shows three words with two differ-
ent melodies.
The first version is an invitation to Grandma to join in the feast. The second
one, though, sounds like an invitation for Grandma to be the feast. “Let’s eat,
Grandma” is very different from “Let’s eat Grandma”!
Going further, we could make the second version even darker and more
threatening by using a minor scale instead of a major scale (Figure 5-5).

Part II: Melody and Development 

As you can see, your choice of scale can contribute to the mood messages
you are trying to convey in your music.
In the examples so far, we’ve stuck to using short phrases of language to make
a point. But there is no reason why you couldn’t apply these ideas to an entire
conversation — perhaps a musical transcription of your tape-recorded bus trip.
If you are writing a song, it is essential to be respectful of the way your lyrics
fit rhythmically and melodically with your music, but you don’t have to be a
great lyricist to use a verbal idea as a source for your melodies. Maybe you
will be the only one who knows that your famous composition started out as
“Scrambled eggs, oh, baby how I love your legs” (Paul McCartney’s original
lyrics for “Yesterday”).
Finding Melody in the World Around You
Just about every composer has found inspiration for a song from walking out-
side and blinking at the world at one point or another. Nature is a great
source of inspiration; city sidewalks and noisy factories are others.
Sometimes it’s just picking up the recurring rhythms of the environment and
building a simple melody on top of that.
Other times, it can be as simple as stealing a bird’s song for your melody — or
the quiet humming or muttering of someone walking past you on the street,
or the varying pitches of a concrete saw whining across the street. Some com-
posers even claim that when they see the throat of a newly-opened flower,
they hear singing in their heads. The inspiration for the greatest composi-
tions in the world is all around you. Learning how to turn that inspiration into
actual music is the challenge. 
Sometimes composing a melody can be like creating a sonic dot-to-dot drawing.
Many composers have attempted to recreate scenery, landscapes, cityscapes,
and the activities of nature and humanity through their compositions, such
as in George Gershwin’s “Grand Canyon Suite.” In fact, some melodies can be
seen as literal landscapes on the musical staff. If you extract the basic melody
from music, connect the notes on the staff, and hold it up in front of you, it
looks like a dot-to-dot drawing of a scene.
If a melody is like a sonic painting of a landscape, the melody rises and dips
into hills and valleys, sometimes quickly jumping up cliffs, and then just as
suddenly diving into ravines.

48
Part II: Melody and Development 

We don’t expect you to be able to fully compose music yet. The preceding
exercise is meant to show that you can draw inspiration and generally shape
music around it.
If you were to stop and think about your choices of notes and rhythms to 
represent these scenes, you might also want to consider representing other
unseen elements within them. For example, what other sounds — birds,
waterfalls, insects — might be present, and how can they be represented
musically? What sort of emotion does each scene convey to you? How can
you represent and refine that emotion through tempo, choice of scale (also
called mode), and instrumentation?
The visual realm is not the only one from which you can draw melodic inspi-
ration. What does touch sound like? Soft caresses must sound different from
a slap in the face, right? What about taste — can you represent taste through
musical composition? What makes a piece of music bland or flavorful? And
let’s not forget the sense of smell. Can a musical composition smell sweet?
We’ve certainly all heard a few that stink.
Music is the universal language, and language is descriptive by nature. Your
job as composer is to describe an emotion through your choice of rhythm
and melody — among other things.
Helping Your Muse Help You
One can’t overestimate the value of a good musical imagination. It is the
single most powerful source for making music — if you can tap into it. The
imagination is so powerful, in fact, that since long ago it has been personified
as the Muse.

This is a kind

scape,”

pattern.
49
Chapter 5: Finding Melodies Where You Least Expect Them

Because it is inside your head, though, your imagination is also the hardest
source to put your finger on. Its timing is sometimes off, for one thing. The
Muse can feed you melodies when you least expect them and are least pre-
pared to do anything about them.
Always have a paper and pencil or a small recording device at hand, at all
times, no matter where you go. They are a lot easier to carry around than a
computer and keyboard. 
You can do a few things to help your Muse work more effectively for you.
Here are some things the Muse needs and ideas about how to do your part 
to help:
 The Muse needs space to work in.
Turn off your TV and radio, log off the Internet, turn off your cell phone,
and tell your family and roommates that you are indisposed for the next,
say, hour or two.
 The Muse likes to be nourished.
Every day, expose yourself to a variety of musical influences — not just
the few favorites you keep cycling through. And if you want your Muse
to get real exposure to different music, do it with full attention.
 The Muse likes to be quiet.
Music as a background often silences or distracts the Muse. It is hard to
focus on what you are hearing in the mind’s ear when you’re hearing
things in your physical ear. The Muse is shy. Silence often causes her to
come out of hiding.
 The Muse needs you to follow where she leads.
The Muse can’t do it all; you have to do your part. Once the Muse gives
you something, run with it. Work it, play with it — above all, capture it.
Write it down! Never think that you’ll remember what the Muse tells you.
No matter how impressive your melody seems at the moment, it will slip
out of your head just as magically as it slipped in.
 Your muse needs you to remember what she says.
Keep a pencil and paper or a simple recording device next to your bed.
The first few seconds after you wake up provide the best opportunity to
clearly recall your dreams. Discipline yourself to write them down, even
if there is no music in them. And when you do wake up with a strangely
unfamiliar and uncharacteristic Beatles song in your head, get it down
on paper or tape. It is possible that it wasn’t a Beatles song at all, but
your muse playing hide-and-seek with you.
(Of course, make sure it wasn’t an actual Beatles song before you try to
publish it! This is what happened with Paul McCartney when he wrote
50
Part II: Melody and Development 

“Yesterday” — he woke up with the tune in his head, but it sounded so
familiar he couldn’t believe he hadn’t heard it somewhere before. He went
around worried, for weeks, asking people if they had heard it before.)
 The Muse works for you.
If you sit at your keyboard, piano, guitar, computer, or pad and paper
long enough in a patient, receptive state, your muse will show up more
often than not. The muse lives in your subconscious mind, waiting for
only one thing: your impassioned receptivity. Once you figure out how to
turn that on, you will be on another level entirely as a composer. If you
defend a routine time and place to work quietly, your muse will become
trained to know when and where to make an appearance.
 The Muse is fickle.
Of course, even if you do all of this, it doesn’t always work. That’s why
we call her the Muse.
Finding Melody in Your Instrument
Once you have played an instrument for a while, you develop certain uncon-
scious habits that are imbedded in your muscles and nerves. You can turn
these habits to your advantage.
Using scales in composition
Playing scales over and over on the piano, for example, trains your hands to
behave in a certain way. This hand behavior becomes second nature, and you
become better at grabbing the notes of a piece of actual music. In fact, many
pieces of music have melodies that are not much more than scales.
Consider “Joy to the World” (Figure 5-10).

51
Chapter 5: Finding Melodies Where You Least Expect Them

The first eight notes of this incredibly famous piece are just a descending
major scale — pretty easy notes to grab even for a novice musician.
So scales can definitely be used as melodies. We would get pretty tired of
hearing just scales for melodies after a while, but there are tons of examples
of scales, or pieces of them, appearing in melodies. 
Any succession of notes that comes naturally from the mechanical skills of a
musician can be used for melody. (Of course, ones that don’t come so natu-
rally can be used, too, but that is covered in the next section.)
Each musician has strengths and weaknesses in her playing technique. If you
were to get two or three guitar players to improvise freely on the guitar, each
of them would bring idiosyncrasies to the task. But because they have cer-
tain trained habits, just the act of grabbing a few seemingly random notes has
the potential of generating excellent melodic ideas.
Improvisation is limited by skill sets, but style in some respects is a product
of limitations as well as strengths. Mining the simple, intuitive, mechanical
structure of your instrument can bring a wealth of melodic material, but
many musicians toss aside melodic opportunities because they don’t con-
sider their improvisations to be anything but momentary bits of magic. Just
because something is easy for you to play, it doesn’t mean it would be worth-
less as a melody.
On the other hand, many musicians think everything they play is golden.
Sometimes it’s hard to evaluate your own work. Criticism is better than
praise in this context most of the time. Find someone you can bounce ideas
off. If you are receiving constructive criticism, and the criticism makes some
sense to you, you are on the right track.
Learn to be a pack rat. Keep all your ideas.
Using music theory in composition
With enough knowledge of music theory and a familiarity with the mechanics
and languages of instruments, a composer can invent melodies. These melodies
emerge from the possibilities within scales, modes, keys, and the techniques
and limitations of the musicians who will be required to play them.
For example, a composer who knows how far a breath can get a musician on
a clarinet — and the range of the instrument and its limits in terms of speed
and versatility — can write melodies for that instrument largely out of theo-
retical abstraction. Just throw possibilities and challenges at the instrument
52
Part II: Melody and Development 

based on a mode or mood that you are trying to convey. At one moment you
can create fast-moving, frenetic phrases that jump about like grasshoppers,
and at the next you can conjure pensive, provocative themes to be traded
and danced around by the instruments.
This type of melodic composition demands an intimate knowledge of both
music theory and the demands of playing each instrument. It can lead to
many powerful results, although often the composer doesn’t have such a
clear idea of what the result will be until the music is played. It can be hard to
hear these things in your head. 
Exercises
1. Keep working with language.
Short or long phrases are rich sources of rhythms and melodies. See if
you can fit a couple of different phrases together in a way that makes
rhythmic or melodic sense. Take the melody you found in language
phrases and see if you can fit a different phrase into the music. Write the
phrase once and then write a variation. Read poetry for inspiration.
2. While listening to a piece of music, draw freely.
Take a crayon, pen, or pencil and freely draw, moving your pencil along
with the flow and contours of the music. You can draw abstract shapes,
or if you prefer, something the music reminds you of. If you’re using 
a colored pen or crayon, pay attention to the colors suggested and 
use them.
3. Draw the landscapes suggested by the melodic movements of a piece
of music. 
4. Come up with a short melody to describe the scene outside your 
front door.
Add two or three more elements from the scene to it — a car driving 
by, a dog barking, a squirrel skittering past, the baby across the street
screaming — and see how much of the individual parts of the scene you
can put together. Your neighborhood has a soundtrack — what is it?
5. Sit quietly with the TV and the radio turned off and listen to your
breathing.
Does a rhythm or melody bubble up? Be prepared with paper and pencil.
Keep a paper and pencil next to your bed. Force yourself to write some-
thing down every morning immediately after waking up. Even a single
word or a measure of music could help you get in touch with your muse.
53
Chapter 5: Finding Melodies Where You Least Expect Them

Have an instrument nearby that is ready to go. Take your guitar out of
the case and leave it setting in a stand, ready to play. If you get a melody
in your head, force yourself to write it in the key you heard it in inside
your head. This will help keep your material from all sounding the same.
6. Sit at your instrument and just let your hands land on the notes.
If you don’t come up with something good right away, keep repeating the
mediocre things until they lead to something better. Trust your hands. If
you hear something unusual or dissonant don’t throw it away, work with
it. How will you resolve the ideas?
7. Try writing a few phrases of random notes keeping within a key 
or mode.
Think of a specific instrument when you write. If it is a wind instrument,
remember that the musician needs to breathe. If it is a stringed instru-
ment, keep the bowing and picking in mind. Just fill up some measures
without thinking too much about how it might sound. Then try playing
what you wrote. Make adjustment where necessary.

S
ometimes you have more of an idea about the direction you want your
melody to move in than which notes you’re going to use to create your
melody. This is true of the melodies you may imagine building when you look
at a landscape. Even more often, probably, you have an idea of the mood you
want to convey with your music, without thinking about whether the melody
should rise, fall, or take on any specific shape. If you are writing with a sense
of directional movement — that is, up and down the staff — there are times
you can benefit from limiting yourself to notes within a scale or mode.
There are twelve different pitches in the Western chromatic scale. That’s the
total number of notes that are available in any one octave. But there are
many other combinations of those notes — other scales — and if you don’t
know at least several of them frontward and backward, you should work on
that, because it can benefit your composing tremendously. The other scales
have fewer than twelve notes, boiling them down to as few as five or as many
as seven.
 Diatonic scales have seven different pitches in them.
 Pentatonic scales have five different pitches in them.

For our purposes in this chapter, the words scale and mode mean pretty
much the same thing: a particular selection of successive notes within an
octave. You will encounter both terms, so we use both here, too.
Major and Minor Modes 
and the Circle of Fifths
Different modes and scales can evoke different moods. Major scales are good
for happy, lively, calming moods. The minor ones are great communicators of
sadness, seriousness, and introspection.
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 show two examples of nearly identical melodies in terms
of directional movement. 
Figure 6-1 is in a major mode, and Figure 6-2 is minor.
Play those pieces on an instrument, and you can easily hear the difference in
mood between these two examples without even knowing what written key
they’re in (we deliberately left out the key signature). The melody in Figure
6-1 is actually in the key of F major, and the one in Figure 6-2 is in F minor.

Note that even though the directional shape of the notes on the staffs are
identical, the pieces sound different because the first example is in a major
mode and the second example is in a minor mode.
Figures 6-3 and 6-4 show them with their proper key signatures.
It’s normally taken for granted that music students have memorized the Circle
of Fifths, but sometimes a refresher may be called for (Figure 6-5). Remember
that every time you move one letter clockwise from the C major/A minor posi-
tion at the top, you add a sharp to the key signature. And at every point
counterclockwise from C major/A minor, you add a flat. The major keys are
given capitalized letters here, and the minor keys are in lowercase. Each posi-
tion on the circle contains two keys: the major key and its relative minor,
which share the same key signature.

Chapter 6: Scales and Modes, Moods and Melodies

It is useful to note that when you are writing something in a particular major
key and you want to change the mood a little (maybe make it a little sadder
or darker), you can use the relative minor scale of the key. For example, if
your original melody was in G major, you could change to E minor for the sad
parts. Doing this makes it unnecessary to change the key signature, though
you may have to use a few accidentals here and there. Figure 6-5 shows you
at a glance which major keys coordinate with which minor keys. 
Another common practice in composition is to write the darker, sadder bits
in the minor key of the original major. In other words, go from a G major scale
to a G minor. As you can see from the Circle of Fifths chart in Figure 6-5, the
parts written in G major would be written with the key signature for G, which
has a single sharp (F sharp). The parts in G minor, then, would require the

signature from its relative major, which is B flat. The key signature for B flat
has two flats: a B flat and an E flat. 
Getting Moody
It’s no big secret that playing a good song is an easy way to set the mood of 
a room. For some reason, that’s doubly true in film. How many times have
you watched a film with a wall-to-wall soundtrack of busy, unconnected pop
songs and had it spoil the picture for you? How long does it take to get the
creepy but incredibly simple soundtracks of films like Halloween or Friday the
13th out of your head after watching them?
The connection between music and mood isn’t even confined to the human
realm, either: Birds, bees, and four-legged animals of all sizes modulate their
vocal utterances to try to attract mates or scare away competition. And if
you think dogs barking isn’t musical, then we must insist you take one more
listen to the Jingle Dogs’ Christmas Unleashed. 
The ancient Greeks believed that not only did music itself invoke mood and
even provoke certain behaviors, but that the modes the songs were written in
were just as responsible. The original name for the Greeks’ set of seven musi-
cal scales was échos, later renamed modus by the Romans who adopted the
system.
Plato himself recommended that soldiers preparing for war should listen to
music written in Dorian and Phrygian modes (more on these modes in the
next section). In a modern context, that would mean that before heading 
off for any great confrontation, one should listen to songs like The Doors’
“Light My Fire,” Steppenwolf’s “Born to Be Wild,” Jefferson Airplane’s “White
Rabbit,” and Yngwie Malmsteen’s “Heavy E Phrygian.” On the other hand,
Plato discouraged these same soldiers from listening to songs in the Lydian
or Ionian modes because it would interfere with their bloodlust. Therefore,
putting on R.E.M.’s “Man on the Moon” is not a good idea before going off 
to war.
Plato and Aristotle also believed that an affinity towards certain musical
modes were insights into a person’s character, and that people who were
fond of music in the Ionian, Aeolian, and Locrian modes were too relaxed and
easygoing to do well in high-power political or military positions. After read-
ing this chapter, you might want to take a look at the sort of music you your-
self prefer listening to and see what musical modes most often pop up in your
personal CD collection.

Chapter 6: Scales and Modes, Moods and Melodies

Moods à la Modes
Just playing a mode or scale without any particular melody in mind can
inspire you to come up with a melody. An easy way to start experiencing a
few different modes is to play scales on all white piano keys, but starting on
the different notes within the C scale. There are seven modes (often called
church modes, although they’re really ancient Greek) that you can make this
way because there are seven unique white piano keys in an octave.
For example: Play a scale from F to F using only the white keys. Note that you
will play the B natural instead of the B flat that is found in the key of F major.
You just played a scale in the Lydian mode, and it sounds a little different
from the old “Do Re Mi” that you learned as a kid.
You can try all seven modes by starting and finishing on other notes using
only the white keys. Can you hear the interesting mood possibilities lurking
in these modes? You can gain a lot of ideas by sampling the different modes
and deciding which mode evokes which moods.
Let’s look at all seven modes a little more closely now. It’s true that for sim-
plicity’s sake we’re illustrating the modes using only the white keys on the
piano keyboard. But of course, each mode can be based on any note. It’s the
different pattern of the intervals between the notes that defines each mode.
Ionian (major scale)
When you play seven ascending white keys starting with C, you get the Ionian
mode (Figure 6-6). To build an Ionian scale on another note besides C, you
use the whole-step (W), half-step (H) pattern: WWHWWWH.
Notice something familiar about this? You’re right — this is the same pattern
used to build major scales today.

Part II: Melody and Development 

Dorian
Figure 6-7 shows the D Dorian mode. To build a Dorian mode on another note
besides D, you would use the pattern WHWWWHW.
The Dorian mode is most commonly heard in Celtic music and early American
folk songs derived from Irish melodies. Songs written in Dorian mode sound
melancholy and soulful because the final note of the scale doesn’t quite resolve
itself, so it feels almost like a question left unanswered. 
Phrygian
Figure 6-8 shows the E Phrygian mode. To build a Phrygian mode on another
note besides E, you would use the pattern HWWWHWW. 
Most flamenco music is written in the Phrygian mode, which has a bright,
Middle-Eastern sound to it that works well with folk and traditional dance
music. Many modern composers and guitarists commonly use Phrygian
modes with major scales (instead of minor scales) because it sounds brighter
and less melancholic than the minor scale.

Chapter 6: Scales and Modes, Moods and Melodies

Lydian
Figure 6-9 shows the F Lydian mode. To build a Lydian mode on another note
besides F, you would use the pattern WWWHWWH.
The Lydian mode is the complete opposite of the Ionian mode/major scale,
so it feels as solid and bright as a major scale but the intervals are surprising
and unexpected. This is a popular mode among jazz musicians who enjoy
using a mixture of major and minor chord progression in inventive ways.
Mixolydian
Figure 6-10 shows the G Mixolydian mode. To build a Mixolydian mode on
another note besides G, you would use the pattern WWHWWHW. 
Mixolydian is similar to Lydian in the sense of having a major-scale feel with
minor intervals, and it’s a great mode to work within to give a bluesy feel to
your compositions. Mixolydian mode is another popular scale for solo musi-
cians looking for a counterpoint to the Ionian key of the song.

Part II: Melody and Development 

Aeolian (natural minor)
Figure 6-11 shows the A Aeolian mode. To build an Aeolian scale on another
other note, the pattern you’d use is WHWWHWW.
This should also look familiar to you — it is the whole-step, half-step pattern
we use to build minor scales today. 
The intervals of Aeolian mode create the same feel as many modern blues
songs. Songs composed in Aeolian mode have a strong sense of sadness. The
final note of an Aeolian scale feels resolved in a completely different sense
than the final note of the Ionian. If the Dorian mode reflects melancholy, the
Aeolian reflects despair.
Locrian
Figure 6-12 shows the B Locrian mode. To build a Locrian scale on any other
note, you would use the pattern HWWHWWH.
Locrian mode is considered to be so unstable that most composers consider
it unworkable. There are few songs written in the Locrian mode, which has
led some music theorists to label it a “theoretical” mode. You find it occa-
sionally used in heavy metal. This mode exists because all seven notes of 
the Ionian scale could form it in a mathematical sense, but the relationship
between intervals in the Locrian mode is difficult for many composers to
work with. Music that is composed within this mode sounds unsettling, dis-
turbing, and just a little bit off. Listen to the synthesizer melody at the begin-
ning of Rush’s “YYZ” for an example, or try playing “Three Blind Mice” in a
Locrian mode — it sounds like incidental music from a Tod Browning film.

Chapter 6: Scales and Modes, Moods and Melodies

These modes are good tools for writing tonal music (music that conforms to a
scale or mode and adheres to a tonal center or key). By limiting yourself to
notes within a particular mode — that is, notes that make some harmonic
sense together — you may find it easier to write something engaging for most
listeners. As we’ve said, your composition style is partly a product of your
limitations, and modes are limitations. Working within limitations can help
you define your style. It’s like tennis: It wouldn’t be as fun without the net and
the lines that define the court.
When working with scales, keys, and modes, be aware of the character of the
mode choices you have made. Some modes and scales sound happy and
simple, and others sound foreign to the unexposed ear.
There are also quite a few other scales and modes that are not used much 
at all in Western music — and by Western we don’t mean cowboy campfire
songs, we mean European music and its descendents. Some non-Western
scales have pitches between our half steps called quarter tones. Some use
intervals that sound odd, or even out of tune to the Western ear. The subject
of modes and scales is a huge one, but if you intend to compose music where
a keyboard of some kind is involved, you probably won’t have any way of
conveying pitches in some of these exotic modes.
The Pentatonic Scale
There is one kind of scale that is fairly common throughout the world —
despite all the other musical differences among various cultures. That would
be the pentatonic scale, also called the five-toned scale. One can refer to a
major pentatonic scale or a minor pentatonic scale, but the notes of the
major scale are shared with the relative minor key.
For example, Figure 6-13 shows a G major pentatonic scale, and Figure 6-14
shows the pentatonic scale of its relative minor, E minor.

Part II: Melody and Development 

Notice that although these two scales have a different tonic note, they share
the same five notes: G, A, B, D, and E (which are the first, second, third, fifth,
and sixth tones of the diatonic scale). Many of the other scales and modes
around the world seem to revolve around this simple scale formula. Every
rock-and-roll guitar soloist on the planet can play a pentatonic scale without
even thinking about it (though many of them might not know what it is
called). There is a pentatonic scale lurking behind most tonal music.
Harmonic and Melodic Minor
Two commonly used scales that aren’t listed in the above modes and scales
are the harmonic minor and the melodic minor scales. These scales differ
from the natural minor scale (Aeolian mode) — which is basically a scale
taken directly from a relative major — in small, but important ways.
Harmonic minor sharps the seventh note in the scale (Figure 6-15). This note
brings the scale a little closer to the A major scale, but other notes in the
scale prevent it from sounding too happy.

Chapter 6: Scales and Modes, Moods and Melodies

The melodic minor scale has different notes when the scale ascends than it
does when the scale descends (Figure 6-16).
It is like a major scale with a flatted third on the way up, and it is a natural
minor on the way down. This is so that it fits better with the movements of
chords in cadences (see Chapter 10 for more on cadences).
Exercises
1. Try to write a melody using notes from the C major scale while play-
ing a G major chord underneath.
The scale from G to G is G Mixolydian mode now. If you want, you could
add a flat 7th (F natural) to the chord you are playing for a more playful-
sounding combination.

f you wrote melodies for the landscape drawings in Chapter 5, you may
have noticed that some of the landscapes suggested repetitive themes and
some didn’t. Some lent themselves to the use of a few short statements,
whereas others seemed to demand more of a single, long narrative. Musical
themes in composition are characterized by three main categories:
 Motif: A motif is the smallest form of melodic idea. It can be as short 
as two notes, like “cu coo,” or the first two notes of the theme from 
Star Wars.
 Melodic phrase: A melodic phrase can be up to four or more measures
in length. Often a phrase is not really a complete musical idea. Phrases
are usually separated by slight pauses, breaths, or rests. You can think
of them as being similar to a single line of poetry. Several phrases make
a period.
 Period: A period is a complete melodic idea. It can be 4, 8, 16, or even
more measures long. It constitutes a musical completeness and can con-
tain motifs or short or long phrases. When we refer to musical forms
using letters (ABA and so on), each letter usually represents a period.
You use these three kinds of melodic elements to build your compositions.

The Long and Short of Musical Themes:
Motifs and Phrases
Often a composer’s entire body of work belies a tendency towards melodic
long-windedness — using long, elaborately developed phrases — whereas
other composers are more at home with shorter, choppier motifs.
Take a look at Maurice Ravel’s long and winding opening phrase in his famous
one-movement orchestral piece, Boléro (Figure 7-1).
If you’re not familiar with Boléro, and you have a high tolerance for pruri-
ence, go out and rent the film 10, starring Dudley Moore, a heavily be-braided
Bo Derek, and lots of jogging. You’ll be glad you did. 
Now, compare Boléro to Figure 7-2: Beethoven’s four-note exclamatory motif
in his Symphony No. 5 (Opus 67).

Part II: Melody and Development 

If you don’t know that one, you must have just crawled out from under the
rock where you’ve been hiding for at least 200 years. 
In the Ravel piece, he weaves his melody up and down for sixteen measures
before he gets us to the end of a period, whereas Beethoven doesn’t even
need four beats to state his motif. There is no question that both these com-
positions were successes for their composers, but their approaches are obvi-
ously very different. There are similarities as well: Each repeats his theme
and explores variations throughout the piece, giving the theme to different
instruments and throwing it at the listener from various perspectives. 
With Ravel, our fascination springs from seeing how far he can take a single,
long theme while keeping it within a very repetitive rhythmic framework. Or
is it seeing how far he can push a repeating rhythmic idea by leading us
through it with his melodic narrative? The rhythm helps us hold our place as
his long narrative expands. The long melody line keeps us from getting bored
with the rhythm. Of course, the long, slow build-up of magnitude and inten-
sity creates tension and keeps us interested, too.
Beethoven’s melodic repetitiveness holds our interest because we are fasci-
nated and surprised by the variations he is able to bring to such a short,
powerful motif, and the uses to which he puts such a simple idea. How many
ways can you say, “I love you”? 
It’s okay for your melodies to speak through short melodic ideas or long
ones. The danger lies in losing the listeners’ interest. If your melody goes
around the block a few times before reaching its destination, then maybe you
should support it with a framework that allows your listeners to keep track of
where they are, and where they are headed. A strong, repetitive, supporting
rhythmic phrase or motif could be a good choice. And if your melodic ideas
are short and sweet, it is important not to let them get boring. You have to
get pretty inventive with the various uses of a short motif or phrase to make
it hold interest for very long.

Chapter 7: Building Melodies Using Motifs and Phrases

Remember that a motif is not particularly useful unless it is somewhat self-
contained. If you imagine Beethoven’s Fifth without the fourth note, it would
be very weak and we probably wouldn’t be able to remember it very well.
And Beethoven still needed more development around his motif in order to
drive the idea home without driving the listener crazy. The whistling part
from the movie The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is another good example of
a motif that is complete and sticks in your head as a result. 
Similarly, a good melodic phrase is one that carves a place easily in a lis-
tener’s memory. If the phrase is too much like another one, it might be as
easily forgotten as if it were too complicated to make sense out of. Walking
the line of originality, accessibility, and familiarity is the trick to writing a last-
ing, memorable musical composition. 
Of course, it is not uncommon to hear compositions in which a long melody
line seems almost suspended in timelessness, like Pavane for Une Infante
Defunte by Maurice Ravel. In this composition the composer leads the lis-
tener through several different melodic periods that are almost complete
enough and different enough from one another to have been the basis for
three different compositions.
It is all about mood, and few things are as tricky as sculpting time into a
sense of temporal stasis where time itself seems to stand still.
Building a Melodic Phrase
Let’s step back from motifs for a minute and examine phrases — the most
basic building blocks of melody. How do we turn a couple of bars of melody
into a musical composition? Consider the very simple melody line shown in
Figure 7-3.
Now, let’s make the piece longer than the three measures it already is by
employing repetition. Repetition is just like it sounds — repeating a musical

theme in a piece of music, either immediately after the first time it’s played,
or somewhere later on in the song.
Figure 7-4 shows what it looks like if you repeated the melody immediately
after the first time it’s played.
In Figure 7-5, we employ repetition again, this time adding a few additional
phrases, sticking them in between the repeated parts.
Another way to employ repetition is to have multiple instruments take turns
playing the same phrase. You could give the music in Figure 7-6 to one instru-
ment and that in Figure 7-7 to another, and the result would be a “round” kind
of effect.

Another way to spread the phrase across the instrumentation would be to have
the two instruments take turns “soloing,” as shown in Figures 7-8 and 7-9.
Spicing It Up by Varying the Phrase
If you were a minstrel living in the Middle Ages, the information provided so
far in this chapter would probably be all you would need to know to make
your compositions minimally palatable to an audience. However, modern
audiences want more from a composition than the same musical motifs and
phrases repeated over and over.

Three ways to give them what they want would be to use the following tools:
 Rhythmic displacement
 Truncation
 Expansion
These three methods are all ways to help make your short or long phrases
expand into full-fledged compositions. 
Rhythmic displacement
You can expand a rhythmic idea by changing the meter of the phrase.
Rhythmic displacement is a favorite tool of jazz players. They pass around a
theme, with the rhythm of each solo differing just enough to make it sound
like they’re not all playing the same piece of music — even though they
pretty much are.
In the example shown in Figure 7-10, we’ve taken our original theme and
expanded on it by changing the rhythm of the repeated theme. 
By changing the values of some of the notes, we’ve changed the tempo and
even the mood of the repeated phrase. 
Truncation
When you truncate a verbal phrase, you cut it short (for example, Jefferson
Starship truncated their name to Starship after guitarist Paul Katner left the
band). When you truncate in music, you’re cutting a repeated musical phrase
short, as shown in Figure 7-11.

ment. 
75
Chapter 7: Building Melodies Using Motifs and Phrases

It’s completely up to you where and when you want to make the cut-off. 
Expansion
Expansion is, of course, the opposite of truncation. In expansion, you add
new material to the original phrase to make it last longer. You typically do
this at the end of the phrase, as shown in Figure 7-12.
Expanded phrases are found at the end of many classical music pieces, includ-
ing Beethoven’s “Moonlight” Sonata and, especially, his Symphony No. 5.

eys, modes, meters, tempi, and orchestration can all change within a
composition to express changing moods. A good composer must not be
afraid of using repetition or change to express an idea. Sometimes a change
can be startling, and sometimes it can sneak up on you and happen with a
great deal of subtlety.
A mastery of transitions in music is the mark of a good composer.
In this chapter we give you some helpful ideas to move you from one melodic
theme, or motif, to another.
Structural Tones
One way to introduce change to a piece of music is by reducing your melody
to its structural (central, essential) tones and then building it out again. This
way, you can keep the skeleton of your theme but not sound like you’re just
playing the same melody line over and over. Also, by re-examining your
melody and reducing it to its structural tones, new possible ways to present
the melody line can be opened up to you. 
For example, take a look at the melody shown in Figure 8-1. 

If we boil down that melody to only the most important pitches on the most
important beats, we come up with something like Figure 8-2.
The structural tones shown in Figure 8-2 are the heaviest, most significant
notes of the melody line, and the ones that carry the beat. All the other notes
hinge on these.
Step-wise and Skip-wise Motion
When notes are placed on the staff in alphabetical sequence, in intervals of
one whole or half step, the succession of pitches is said to be step-wise, or
conjunct. Step-wise motion happens when moving from one pitch to the next
in either an ascending (upward in pitch) or descending (downward) direction.
If you were to take the structural notes of our melody and apply step-wise
motion to it, it would look like Figure 8-3.

Part II: Melody and Development 

And, voila, we’ve got a brand-new melody line!
Unlike step-wise motion, skip-wise or disjunct motion is when the melodic line
jumps all over the musical staff. Instead of moving predictably from one tone
or semitone to another, any interval can exist between notes in a piece with
disjunct motion. 
If you were to take our structural tones and apply skip-wise motion to them,
one possibility would look like Figure 8-4.
Passing Tones
Passing tones allow smooth, scale-wise motion in tonal music by “filling in”
the space between two structural tones. Whenever the structural tones are at
least a third apart, the passing tone is a diatonic scale degree in between —
meaning that if the two notes in question in the key of C, are C and E, then the
passing tone would be a D.
However, other intervals may also have passing tones between them. Two or
more passing tones might be used to smooth over a leap of a fourth (from C
to F, for example, the passing tones would be either D or E, or both), or a
single, chromatic passing tone may be used to strengthen the movement of a
major second (from C to D, the passing tone would be a C sharp/D flat).

Chapter 8: Developing Your Melodies

Passing tones are often found above and below the melody, connecting two
notes from the basic melody line together.
You can use passing tones to make a boring chord interesting, to point to the
melody, and/or to just add to the flavor of the song as you make your music
flow.
Now, if we color in the spaces between the notes with passing tones, we
could end up with something like this Figure 8-5.
Can you tell in Figure 8-5 that the structural notes are still there?
Passing tones are always used on the weak beats of a measure, and the struc-
tural tones are used on the strong beats. Paying attention to whether a note
falls on the strong or the weak beats is important, because this deeply affects
the music. 
Neighboring Tones and Appoggiatura
Neighboring tones are notes that are visited briefly (like your neighbors)
before returning home. That is, you start with your structural tone, move up
or down a step or half step, and then return to your original note. It’s a cool
little embellishment that’s used a lot in kids’ piano books, simply because it
sounds much more complicated to play than it actually is. If you rapidly
repeat neighboring tones, as in Figure 8-6, it makes for a neat little trill.

Part II: Melody and Development 

If we take a disjunct leap from a structural tone to a note neighboring the
next structural tone and then step to that tone, we have an appoggiatura, an
example of which is shown in Figure 8-7.
C. P. E. Bach (Carl Philipp Emanuel, son of J. S. Bach) was a great lover of
using the appoggiatura in his musical arrangements. He wrote a good deal of
theory-related material on what exactly should be the requirements for using
appoggiatura in music.
First of all, when a short appoggiatura is written —symbolically, as a small
note — it is ignored when summing up the time values in a bar, as seen in
Figure 8-8.
Second, the appoggiatura is always written on the left of a note, and is
slurred into a principal note — a note normally played on the beat. Third, the
appoggiatura is also always played on the beat, with the principal note fol-
lowing. Basically, the two notes are played almost together, with the appog-
giaturas slurring into the principal note quick enough that both notes carry
the beat.
Appoggiaturas are now more normally known as grace notes, meaning that
they’re extra notes that are “forgiven” for making a measure’s total note value
equal just a little more than allowed.

Chapter 8: Developing Your Melodies

Other Melodic Techniques
Numerous other neat little tricks are available to help you develop your
melody.
Escape tones
An escape tone is kind of the opposite of an appoggiatura (say that five times
fast). You first step away from your tone — and then leap in the other direc-
tion to the next chord tone, as shown in Figure 8-9. Instead of slurring into
the principal note with the beat, an escape tone slurs into the tone note car-
rying the beat.
Suspension 
If you hold a tone out longer than the chord and then drop the note down a
step to your new chord tone, it is called a suspension. Figure 8-10 shows an
example.

Part II: Melody and Development 

Retardation
The opposite of suspension is to stay on your tone and then step up to 
the next tone. This is known as a retardation, and an example is shown in
Figure 8-11.
Anticipation
If you arrive at the next tone before the chord changes, it is called an anticipa-
tion. You’ll see two of these in Figure 8-12: one across the second measure
line, and one across the third.
Pedal point
If you stay on or repeat the same note, despite (or because of) the disso-
nance with the next chord, and keep playing it till the harmony of your chord
progression allows it to resolve, it is called a pedal point.
The pedal point technique is usually used in the bass. If used for an upper
part, such as a soprano, it is called an inverted pedal, and in the middle
voices (tenor or alto) it is called an internal pedal. The name comes from the

bass register pedals of the organ. The organ is capable of sustaining long
notes, and a lot of organ music takes advantage of this fact. 
Figure 8-13 shows an example of a pedal point.
There are a few more obscure names for techniques for moving between
chord tones, such as cambiata, a sort of escape tone that moves in the same
direction as the chord tone. All of the ones we discuss in this chapter can
lend interest, tension, and variety to your chord movements.
You can move any way you like, of course, if it sounds good to you. Now you
know what to call it when you do.
In most of the examples used in this chapter we have stuck to the essence of
the original melody, but you could use the same structural notes and depart
quite a bit from the original, as in Figure 8-13.
One last reminder here is in order: If you massage your melodies with repeti-
tion and the types of techniques that you are comfortable with, and if you
keep a sensitive ear, your melodies will naturally arrive at variations, cli-
maxes, and new themes in just the right way and at just the right time. You’ve
got to roll them around in your head for them to mature and move on, and for
your muse to get a handle on them. Trust this.

compose a transition that makes its own demands regarding the number
of measures required for your musical metamorphosis. How about an
entirely new melody just for the transition?
Build one theme up and up to the breaking point and let the next theme
coalesce from the fallout.
If you can create enough of a ruckus, you will have plenty of musical
material floating around as the dust settles. This is a good way to go
from a fast-paced, exciting mood to a calmer, more serene one.
2. Write an instrumental solo that wanders from the end of one theme to
the beginning of the next.
Throwing a solo into your compositions is often a good way to break up
the scenery. If you are writing in a popular genre, you will probably want
to let the soloist improvise over some chord changes, but if you are able
to write the solo out for the musician, you have an opportunity to create
a bridge between almost any two melodic themes. You need to be espe-
cially knowledgeable about the instruments you are writing for when
you write solos.
It is worthwhile to note that some themes probably don’t belong
together in the same composition, and no amount of massaging them
will reconcile their differences. This doesn’t mean that you should dis-
card one of them. Save it for another piece.
87
Chapter 8: Developing Your Melodies
Less is more
Many composers are guilty of trying to write too
much into their compositions. The old adage
“Less is more” is worth remembering. If you find
yourself doing this (and you realize it), cut your
melodies up at breathing points and make sep-
arate melodies out of them.
When we say “breathing points,” we’re refer-
ring to the places in a good melody where the
natural cycles occur. If you can’t find these in
your music, maybe you aren’t writing melodies
that breathe. It doesn’t necessarily mean that a
person singing your melodies wouldn’t have any
places to breathe (although that is an essential
consideration when writing for any instrument
that uses breath power), but that the cycle of
tension and release that should run through
your music may not be there.
You can read more about creating tension and
release in music in the sections on cadences in
Chapter 10.

Harmony and

In this part . . .
N

begin to figure out what the harmonic components
of the music will be. In this section, we show how study-
ing the melody itself can help tell you what the harmony
needs to be. We also give you lots of hints for where to get
your compositional ideas from, how to get the most out of
chords, and how to use structure and form to your 
advantage.

 Using conflict and resolution to help create harmonies

 Mixing it up with pivot notes
 Exercising your harmonizing
A
melody floating around in space is nice, but a good melody deserves a
framework in which to bob and weave. At least it deserves some com-
pany. Where can we find good harmonizations for our melodic ideas?
A simple melody can suggest a harmony, which in turn can suggest chords.
After all, a chord is nothing more, or less, than a harmonic cluster. So har-
monic composition can mean anything from a melody and a single harmony
to a progression of chords that supports a melody, or from which a melody
can be extracted.
This chapter begins the search for harmonies to go with your melodies. And
we begin by trying to define why some notes sound better together than
others.
Harmonizing Using Consonance 
and Dissonance
One good source for harmony is the melody itself. Melodies often suggest
harmonies, and vice versa. Even a single note can suggest harmony.

A single note played on an instrument can generate enough harmonic over-
tones to define an entire scale. Harmonic overtones happen whenever you
play or sing a note. For example, when you play an open A string on the
guitar, the string vibrates along its entire length, but it also makes smaller
vibrations along two equal halves of its length, three equal thirds, and so on.
Each of these smaller vibrating subdivisions of the string produce pitches
that are related harmonically and mathematically to the fundamental A that
you are playing. We hear these overtones as part of the timbre of the instru-
ment, and don’t usually think of them as separate pitches — but that A you
play actually generates (albeit quietly) all the pitches of the A major scale
and beyond. This is why a brass instrument like a trumpet can play so many
different pitches with only eight possible valve combinations, which relate to
tubing lengths. 
Added to this is the fact that it is quite possible (if not likely) that the melody
in your head is already diatonic, meaning that it has a key center (making it a
tonal melody as opposed to an atonal one). This means that there is a particu-
lar musical scale or set of related pitches from which your melody is drawn,
or with which your melody will feel conformable. This has to do with the way
in which our ears work, along with the musical exposure to scales and modes
that you may have had.
So, without our realizing it, tonal melodies do tend to make their own
demands regarding harmony. You just have to be paying attention and have
the proper tools at hand, such as a pencil and paper or a keyboard and com-
puter, to capture what you hear in your head.
Harmony in music can be defined as any combination of notes that are played
together at the same time. If you play a C and a G together, they sound pleas-
ant, or consonant (Figure 9-1).
& 44 ww
Figure 9-1:
C and G are
consonant
because
they are 
a perfect
fifth apart.
92
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Intervals that produce perfect consonant notes include unisons, octaves, and
perfect fourths and fifths. Imperfect consonants include major and minor
thirds and sixths. But basically, if a harmony is consonant, it sounds at least
okay.
Not all harmony is easy or pleasant to the ear, though. If you substitute a 
G flat for the G, the resulting harmony is dissonant, meaning not so sweet-
sounding (Figure 9-2).
Tritone: The devil’s interval
All the way through the 10th century and beyond, the dissonant augmented
fourth (or flat fifth), also known as a tritone, an example of which is shown in
Figure 9-2, was actually forbidden in music by the Catholic Church. It was
known as the devil’s interval, diabolus in musica, or mi contra fa (all of which
mean roughly the same thing). Play it a few more times to get the sense of
evil that lurks there. Spooky, huh? 
Nowadays, tritones are used in heavy metal. This is partially thanks to Black
Sabbath’s Tony Iommi’s heavy use of the interval. Iommi mostly started using
it after the tips of two fingers on his fretting hand were cut off in a machine
cutter. His homemade prosthetic wouldn’t form power chords as easily as it
would the tritones. This use of tritones, and the band’s eventual discovery
that they had been playing the devil’s interval all along, led to the tritone
being a standard in metal music well into the present. 
Without getting too scientific, our ears interpret combinations of pitches as
consonant when the pitches and their overtones are either in unison, or are at
least a minor third apart. Pitches that are either closer together than a minor
third or have overtones that are closer than a minor third are perceived of as
dissonant. This is why the interval of a minor second (B and C, for example) is
dissonant, and so is the interval of a tritone, or flat fifth (B and F). 
& 44 wwb

93
Chapter 9: Harmonizing with Melodies

It is interesting to note that the differences in music from different cultures
round the world do not lie in the acceptance or usage of consonance, but in
the uses and general acceptance of dissonance. 
It was J.S. Bach who brought tritones into acceptance through his music. So
really, you could say that Bach was the father of death metal — or at least
hair metal. Take a listen to Bach’s “The Goldberg Variations” to see if you can
hear the seeds of “War Pigs” in there. You probably won’t, but you should be
able to hear the masterful use of dissonant tritones in the piece. 
Conflict and resolution
Aside from scaring people and suggesting darkness, of what use is a disso-
nant harmonic interval? Dissonance creates a feeling of instability, tension,
and conflict. In music composition — just as in literature, the cinema, and 
the theater — the concepts of conflict and resolution are extremely impor-
tant. Conflict and resolution keep the plot moving and keep your audience
interested. 
In music, conflict can be represented by dissonant tones, with resolution rep-
resented by consonant tones.
Try playing the set of notes in Figure 9-3 to see what we mean.
Don’t you feel a mild sense of aural relief when the dissonant tones logically
progress to consonant tones? It’s very much like the feeling of coming home.
The musical conflict inflicted on our ears by the dissonant interval is resolved,
and you can rest easy (until the next conflict arises). In fact, we can now tell
what key the music is in because it has clearly arrived at a resolved state and
we can sense that G is the tonic, at least for the moment. Now we can write
the key signature for G (Figure 9-4).

94
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Even though what you play in Figure 9-4 only uses two voices playing three
notes, both melody and harmony are present. You can look at it also as being
really two melodies: one melody being played with the upper register (G, F
sharp, G) and the other being played with the lower set of notes (C, C, B).
There is also a suggestion of full chords implied by these intervals. Try the
obvious first (Figure 9-5).
But with a little knowledge of chords and a sense of melody (or a little experi-
mental mucking around), you could come up with something like Figure 9-6.

95
Chapter 9: Harmonizing with Melodies

This second chord progression (in Figure 9-6) is based on the relative minor
of the first one (in Figure 9-5): The key of E minor is the relative minor of G
major. You could think of this minor version as a substitution — a chord used
instead of the one you would normally use — for the more obvious major 
version. 
It is important to realize that there are many other possible ways that you
could harmonize a simple melody. Our melody could be harmonized into
other keys. It could even exist outside of a diatonic framework. The second
melody here (in Figure 9-6) defines the key signature by presenting some defi-
nition harmonically. It only takes two notes sounding together to imply a har-
monic framework in which a particular melody exists.
Many substitutions for chords are implied by melodies and harmonies. A large
portion of what jazz is all about is being aware of these substitutions and
incorporating them — and the scales attached to them —improvisationally.
But before we start playing around with substitutions, it’s a good idea to tune
into the more usual, mainstream harmonies available. 
Harmonizing Using the Circle of Fifths
Take another look at the Circle of Fifths (Figure 9-7). We have talked about the
fact that as you go clockwise around the Circle, you move through the key
signatures by the interval of a perfect fifth. But did you notice that going
counterclockwise moves you in perfect fourths?
So what? Well, consider that if you start on any slice of the Circle of Fifths pie,
the fifth of the selected key is on its right, and the fourth of the selected key
is on the left. For example, select G. The next one clockwise is D, and counter-
clockwise is C. D is the fifth tone (dominant) of the G major scale, and C is the
fourth tone (subdominant) in the key of G. The fourth and the fifth are the
most important tones in a scale, next to the tonic, and there they are huddled
snugly against the chosen key. The IV chord and the V chord are the most
important chords after the I chord. 
A musical composition, as we have said many times, is like a good story; it
has a beginning, a middle, and an end. In music, we use the terms statement,
development, departure, and resolution (or recapitulation).
96
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

The IV chord often can be used for a sense of departure, while the V chord
gives a sense of anticipation, which itself is a kind of tension, and the I chord
brings us resolution. After you pick a key to write your composition in, you
can look at the circle of Fifths (and Fourths) and easily find the chords that
are in the family of the chosen key. You can start to develop musical ideas
around this family of chords.
Whereas I, IV, and V chords can go a long way (blues and most of rock and
roll are totally based on these three chords), sooner or later we are going to
need more colors in our crayon box to keep our listeners’ attention.
The other diatonic triads (chords with three notes in them) that are in a given
major key’s family are as follows, including which tones of the scale they
include:
C
G
D
A
E

F

 The 2 minor: 2, 4, 6
 The 3 minor: 3, 5, 7
 The 4 major: 4, 6, 1 (or 8)

 The 6 minor (relative minor): 6, 1, 3
 The 7 diminished: 7, 2, 4
See Figure 9-8 for examples in the key of C major.
All of these chords work within the melodic confines of a major scale. They
shift along with the modes (Chapter 6 has more on modes). For example, if
you were working in the Phrygian mode, you would count the third chord
example in Figure 9-8 as the I chord, and all other numbers would shift
accordingly, as shown in Figure 9-9.

Part III: Harmony and Structure 

For most composers, staying within the confines of a major scale is too con-
fining. The chord families shown in Figures 9-8 and 9-9 represent places to
start if you are working up a tonal composition in a set key.
Harmonizing Using Pivot Notes
A good way to escape the comfort and predictability of accepted chord pro-
gressions (see Chapter 10 for more on chord progressions) is to use a note or
two in the melody as a pivot.
What’s a pivot? Find a chord that is related to your melody notes, but not to
the key. Build into a new key center from there, or just depart from the con-
straints of your current key center for a surprising moment and return home
right away if you like. Figures 9-10 and 9-11 provide examples. First, we have a
melody, accompanied by chords that stay within the chord family. Play the
piece in Figure 9-10 accompanied by the chords labeled above the staff lines.
Now let’s try the same melody, only pivoting the tonality with a chord that is
related only to a pair of notes in the melody rather than to the whole key.
Play the piece again, but with the Fmaj7 chord as accompaniment to the
second measure instead (Figure 9-11).

Chapter 9: Harmonizing with Melodies

The music in Figure 9-11 sounds a little more interesting, doesn’t it?
How did we choose the pivot? Well, the Fmaj7 chord contains the E and the A,
but isn’t a close relative to this key signature, so it pulls us out of the key
center for a second. In this case, it actually fakes us out as to what key we are
in, because it is the first chord we hear. This sort of harmonic opportunism
makes the resolution to the tonic even more satisfying because the distance
home is greater than it would be if we were traveling from a closer relative
chord.
Exercises
1. Re-harmonize any familiar song.
Try “Yankee Doodle” in a minor key, for example, or anything you like.
2. Write a chord chart using randomly selected chords from within a
key’s chord family.
Start anywhere, but return to the I chord at the end.
3. Write two alternative melodies for the chord chart you wrote for
Exercise 2.
4. Re-harmonize one of the melodies you just wrote for Exercise 3.
Try to use some pivot chords to escape from the monotony of your
tonal center.
5. Pick two or three unrelated chords and try to string them together
with a melody.
6. Try the same melody with the relative majors or minors of the chords
from Exercise 5.

O
ne major point you should have gotten from your experience with
music theory is that the key signature of a piece of Western tonal music
governs the main notes within that piece. When you want to escape the key
signature within that piece of music, you have to use accidentals (sharps,
flats, and naturals) to indicate notes outside the key.
You can have several octaves’ worth of notes on an instrument, but only the
notes allowed by the key signature can be used without accidentals in that
piece of music. The scale of the piece governs the music’s tonality — which
means breaking free from the original key is a good way to add spice.
Therefore, if you have a song written in C major, the main eight notes that will
appear in the song are C natural, D natural, E natural, F natural, G natural, A
natural, and B natural. If your song is written in A major, the only notes
appearing in that song will be A natural, B natural, C sharp, D natural, E nat-
ural, F sharp, and G sharp. In either of these keys, the chords are also made
of some combination of the seven notes in each key.

There are two types of major chords:
 Diatonic chords are built from the seven notes of a major key signature.
The letter name of a diatonic chord (such as A Major, A minor, or A aug-
mented) comes from the major scale the chord is built on.
 Chromatic chords are built from notes outside the major key signature,
such as chords built on minor scales. Chords found within minor keys
are a little trickier, because nine notes potentially can fit under a single
minor key signature, when you take the melodic and harmonic minor
scales into consideration.
Because the natural, melodic, and harmonic scales are taught as separate
scales for musicians to practice, there a misconception that you have to stick
to one of these types of minor scales when composing music. But really, you
can draw from all three types of minor scales within the same piece of music. 
Chords and Their Moods
You can let your melodic ideas suggest different chords, as we have seen in
previous chapters. This can be a very good way to open up possibilities — by
suggesting departures from your key center and adding color to your work.
But you could just as easily start with a chord progression and build a
melody up from there. Thousands of compositions began with a sense of har-
monic movement first, followed by melody.
Here is an opportunity for your Muse to step in. Or maybe you could just
plunk your hands down on your piano and listen for the possibilities. To
excel at chordal composition you should have a strong knowledge of chords.
You should, at very least, have a working familiarity with following chord
qualities in every key:
 Major and minor
 Major and minor seventh
 Dominant seventh
 Major and minor sixth
 Suspended fourth
 Ninth
 Diminished
 Augmented
102
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

 Minor ninth
 Minor seventh flat fifth
No matter which key you’re in, each of those specific chords comes with its
particular sonic character, called its mood, or quality. Therefore, if you know
how minor chords are constructed, and you sit at that same piano and play
some minor chords, chances are the sound that comes from that set of
chords is closer to what you’re looking for than if you just started playing
random chords.
Certain chords express certain moods. It’s really up to you what sort of mood
is to be implied by each chord, but in the following sections we include a
short list of our own observations, based on asking students to describe the
feelings conveyed by these chords.
Major
Major chords are “happy, simple, honest, bold.”

decide for yourself how each of these chords makes you feel.

It is also important to note that the character of a chord is strongly depen-
dent upon its surroundings. For example, a dark and dissonant chord like a
minor 7, flat 5 sounds dark and dissonant when out there on its own, but if
used to pass from one chord to another, it doesn’t have the same feeling
(Figures 10-14 and 10-15).
Putting Chords Together
Once you have decided on a chord progression for a section of your piece,
you might find it useful to experiment with different chord voicings, or all the
different ways the same chord can be put together. A simple triad (a chord
with three different pitches in it) has three different arrangements of its notes
within an octave.
A chord’s voicing can be arranged in the following ways:
 Root voicing has the root as the lowest note: C (root), E, G
 First inversion: E, C, G
 Second inversion, G, C, E

The examples in Figures 10-16 through 10-18 use the C major chord to 
illustrate.
If you already have a melody, you will find the melody useful in determining
your chord voicings. Most often you will want the melody to represent the
top notes in your chords. This will dictate which voicings sound best. If you
don’t have a melody yet, choosing your chord voicings can help you write
one. Try a few chord voicing changes and have your melody grab the top
notes. If you don’t like the results, invert some chords and try again. Don’t
forget to use some passing tones while you are at it.

Chapter 10: Composing with Chords

Rhythmic Movement 
When composing with chords, determining a rhythmic movement for your
chord changes may help. What this means is that you will decide how often,
and on which beats or accents, your chords will generally change. You could
have a chord change every measure, every four measures, every two beats,
or even every beat within a measure. The choice is yours, but remember that
fast-moving melodies can sound awkward if the chords change too quickly. A
general rule is that more frequent chord changes work better with slower
melodies, but this, like most rules, can be broken from time to time.
Of course, the rhythmic movement of your chord changes can vary as your
composition moves along. You don’t need to keep the chords changing at the
same rate throughout the section of your piece (Figure 10-19). 
The chords you write might not be played by a guitar, piano, or other poly-
phonic instrument. They might be played by a string quartet, a horn ensem-
ble, or any other combination of instruments. Writing chord changes out first
is just one way to create some underlying structure for your composition.
You may want to find some locations in the rhythmic structure of your com-
position that lend themselves to pivoting your chords out of the key center. It
is not difficult to hear in your head where a surprise or a change harmoni-
cally would be good.
Just don’t overdo the surprises and departures. If you are driving down a
bumpy road and you hit another bump, it doesn’t mean much. Lead the lis-
tener into your changes. Build drama, tension, and release.

Chord Progressions
One way to easily build tension and release in your music is to follow some of
the simple rules already laid out for you hundreds of years ago by people like
Christiaan Huygens and Nicola Vicentino. According to them — and the thou-
sands of musicians who followed — certain sequences of chords, called chord
progressions, sound nicer than others. Over time, a consensus about the
“rules” of chord progressions has come about.
In the following sections, capital Roman numerals indicate major chords, and
lowercase Roman numerals stand for minor chords. The numeral itself stands
for the note on the major scale the chord is built on. For example, in C major,
the I would be a C major chord, the ii would be D minor, the iii would be E
minor, and so on. The ” symbol indicates a diminished chord, and the + symbol
is used for augmented chords.
“Rules” for major chord progressions
 I chords can appear anywhere in a progression.
 ii chords lead to I, V, or vii” chords.
 iii chords lead to I, ii, IV, or vi chords.
 IV chords lead to I, ii, iii, V, or vii” chords.
 V chords lead to I or vi chords.
 vi chords lead to I, ii, iii, IV, or V chords.
 vii” chords lead to I or iii chords.
“Rules” for minor chord progressions
 i chords can appear anywhere in a progression.
 ii” or ii chords lead to i, iii, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 III or III+ chords lead to i, iv, IV, VI, #vi”, vii”, or VI chords.
 iv or IV chords lead to i, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 V or v chords lead to i, VI, or #vi” chords.
 VI or #vi” chords lead to i, III, III+, iv, IV, V, v, vii”, or VII chords.
 vii” or VII chords lead to the i chord.
113
Chapter 10: Composing with Chords

As far as these rules go, they just mean (in the case of major chord progres-
sions) that a ii chord (such as D minor if you’re playing in the key of C major)
sounds most natural when it leads to I (C major), V (G major), or vii” (B dimin-
ished). However, there’s absolutely no reason why you can’t go from a ii chord
to a IV chord, for example — but you have to bear in mind that it won’t be
what listeners are expecting.
When it comes to departing from the rules, a little goes a long way. You may
have to back off after using a couple of unconventional chord changes and
play more conventional ones to satisfy your audience. Pop music especially
adheres to the rules regarding chord progressions, and is even more didactic
than classical music about what sounds “good” and what sounds “strange.”
Try the above chord progressions with an added seventh to the triads to 
see if they sound acceptable to you. You will probably find that some sound
good — and some, not so good. 
Coming Home with Cadences
An important part of making your music (and audience) breathe is through
the use of cadence, or a return to the I/i chord from a iv or a V chord.
The longer you take to reach this point of cadence, the more tension you can
build in your music.
A musical phrase can come to an end by simply stopping, of course, but if
that stopping position doesn’t make “sense” to the listeners, they may not be
very happy with you. Ending your song on the wrong note or notes is like
ending a conversation with a non sequitur, and you may leave your listeners
a little uncomfortable. Some audiences are absolutely delighted to hear
music that confounds their expectations, however, and this may be exactly
the audience you’re trying to reach.
This section covers the four main types of cadences:
 Authentic
 Plagal
 Deceptive/Interrupted
 Half-cadence
114
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Authentic cadences 
Authentic cadences are the most obvious-sounding cadences and are there-
fore considered the strongest. In an authentic cadence, the harmonic goal of
the phrase is the 5 chord, (V or v, depending on whether the piece is in a
major or minor key). The cadence occurs when you move from that V/v
chord to a I/i chord, as shown in Figure 10-20.
Plagal cadences 
The harmonic goal of a plagal cadence is ultimately the 4 (IV or iv) chord,
with cadence occurring when the 4 chord moves to the 1 chord. The progres-
sions IV-I, iv-i, iv-I, and IV-i are all possibilities. The plagal structure originated
with Medieval Church music, which was mostly vocal, and is therefore often
referred to as the Amen cadence. If you’re familiar with Gregorian chants at
all, or even many modern hymns, then you’ve heard the Amen cadence in
action. It usually happens (no surprise here) at the point where the chanters
sing the two-chord “A-men.”
Despite the “amen” label, plagal cadences are usually used within a song 
to end a phrase, and not at the very end of a song, because they’re not as
decisive-sounding as a perfect cadence (Figure 10-21).

Chapter 10: Composing with Chords

Deceptive or interrupted cadences 
A deceptive cadence, or interrupted cadence, essentially reaches an ultimate
point of tension on a V/v chord, just like the authentic cadence, but it
resolves to something other than the tonic (I/i) chord — hence, the name
deceptive. The most common deceptive cadence out there, used 99 times out
of 100, is the V/v chord that moves up to a VI/vi chord. The phrase looks and
feels like it’s about to end and close with the 1 chord, but instead it moves up
to the 6 instead, as shown in Figure 10-22.
Other deceptive/interrupted cadences include moving from the V chord 
to the IV chord, the V chord to the ii chord, and the V chord to the V7.
Deceptive cadences are considered one of the weakest cadences because
they invoke a feeling of incompleteness.
Half-cadences
Half-cadences are a little more confusing. The authentic, plagal, and decep-
tive cadences all occur in musical phrases that resolve before the phrase is
complete. In other words, with the other cadences the phrase starts at a
point of rest (I/i) and moves through a series of chords to reach either a iv/IV
or a v/V chord. It could be as easy as the I/i chord going straight to the V/v
chord and back to the I/i, or it could spend 20 hours circling like a plane in a
holding pattern between those points, but authentic, plagal, and deceptive
will all musically release to the point of rest: the I/i chord.

116
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Half-cadences are the only ones that don’t end this way. With a half-cadence,
the musical phrase ends at the point of tension — the V/v chord itself. It basi-
cally plays to a chord that is not the I/i and stops, resulting in a musical
phrase that feels unfinished. Examples would be a V-IV progression, a V-vi
progression, a V-ii progression, and a V-V7 progression. It’s called a half-
cadence simply because it just doesn’t feel like it’s done yet.
Fitting Chords and Melodies Together
Often, when you’re working with just a melody, the basic accompanying har-
mony is already there in your subconscious. The melody lends itself to the
harmony so obviously that accompanying the melodic line is the easiest part
of writing the music. You may be aware of which note in your melody repre-
sents the tonic note right away, and you might even be aware of very specific
chord movements that are screaming out at you from your melody.
Likewise, that cool chord progression you came up with last night is eager to
provide you with structural tones (also sometimes called chord tones) from
which a melody can magically emerge (see Chapter 8 for more information on
structural tones).
Extracting harmony from melody
If you take a simple major scale and consider only the I chord (also called the
tonic), the IV chord (the subdominant), and the V chord (the dominant), you
can hear fairly simple and obvious suggestions of relationship between notes
in the given key that might be used to accompany them.
There are, of course, many other possibilities and substitutions, but here we
stick with the I, IV, and V chords in the example shown in Figure 10-23.

Chapter 10: Composing with Chords

You can use tones from within the chords (called, as we mentioned, chord
tones) and string these tones together in various ways using non-chord tones.
Some of the techniques for stringing together different melody notes are cov-
ered in Chapter 8. Here we cover some more techniques.
First, let’s give an example of a simple chord progression that we can use to
extract some structural tones from (Figure 10-24).
Now we extract a melody from these chords using only notes from within
each chord — the chord tones (Figure 10-25).
Now let’s add some passing tones. Remember that passing tones close the
gaps between structural tones. They make disjunct melodies more conjuct.
Passing tones go in steps and end up stepping into the next structural tone
(Figure 10-26).

If you step away from the tone before stepping back to it, it is called a neigh-
boring tone (Figure 10-27).
Using chord changes
A chord change is a powerful thing. It is hard to take a chord change lightly.
That is why you need to be picky about the choices you make regarding
where in the rhythm of your music the chords change.
If your chords change every measure on beat one, that beat will be strength-
ened. If instead you place the chord changes on beats four and one, both of
those beats will gain some gravity. A chord change brings some attention to
any rhythmic subdivision. It is a good idea to place chord changes strategi-
cally to emphasize the rhythmic feel, or groove, of your piece.
Often your music will benefit from adding more chords in between the struc-
tural chords you started off with. For this you can go back to your non-chord
tones, as shown earlier in this chapter. Some of the non-chord tones you
added while stringing together your chord tones may provide rhythmic
accents. Or maybe you just like these notes and want the listener’s attention
drawn to them. So why not add chord changes at those same moments? Let’s
call these passing chords.

Figure 10-28 shows the example again with all the non-chord tones we added.
Now let’s add some passing tones to go along with the non-chord tones
(Figure 10-29).
That makes for a richer, more colorful phrase, doesn’t it? The possibilities are
limitless. You could have a chord change every beat, every half beat, or what-
ever suits your intentions. This would be a good time to go back and study
the table we gave you, earlier in this chapter, regarding chord progressions.
Knowing which chords flow into which can be helpful here. And don’t forget
about the moods you evoke with your choices. A study of jazz can provide
you with some ideas about chord substitutions as well.
On the other hand, there are times when a chord change is distracting and
pulls away from the hypnotic, trancelike mantra of your groove. As an exam-
ple, Ravel’s Boléro (which was written intentionally as a piece with no struc-
tural development) pulls us along and drives us deeper and deeper into its
feel. When Ravel exhausts the dynamic headroom of his orchestra, he sur-
prises us and wakes us up into a new realm by changing the chord and the

tonality all at once, near the very end. This alerts us that the climax is on its
way (it also puts the orchestra in a range where there is some additional
dynamic power to be tapped into). It is totally unexpected and somewhat dis-
concerting, but he had to launch an ending somehow.
You’re okay when you can use an unexpected wake-up chord change as pow-
erfully as Ravel, but in the meantime be careful not to loosen your hold on
the listener with too many chord changes if you’ve got a good groove on.
You can have more than one musical idea going on at the same moment in
the same piece. Three or more are perhaps too many, because confusion
ensues and the listener doesn’t know where to turn. You always want to
retain a sense of focus, even when your music gets chaotic. 
You could have your chords change in one rhythmic pattern and have the
melody move in another pattern. Mixing it up like that would convey two dif-
ferent rhythmic statements. You might think of it as keeping the non-chord
tones and the chord structure and throwing out some of the structural chord
tones in your piece.
Figure 10-30 shows an example with a tiny bit of polishing.
From what we have discussed in this chapter so far, it should be easy enough
to reverse these processes if you had a melody to start with and were looking
for the right chords to go along with it. You have to decide which notes in
your melody are structural, as we discuss in Chapter 8. Then you can deter-
mine the key of your piece and where you feel you need to accentuate your
melody with chords. The challenge here is to be aware of the many harmonic
possibilities available to you for harmonizing your melody.

Chapter 10: Composing with Chords

There are more harmonic possibilities in a single note than there are melodic
possibilities in a chord.
Exercises
1. Harmonize an ascending fifth (one letter name clockwise around the
Circle of Fifths).
Find chords that fit with a D note held for two beats followed by an A
above held for two beats. Ideas:
Start with a D major chord.
Start with a B flat major chord.
Start with an E minor 7 flat 5 chord.
Start with a G major chord.
2. Try chord progressions at random.
Write the names of a dozen or so chords on small pieces of paper. Make
sure you include some of the ones that sound strange to you. You can
use any chord in any key. Put them in a hat and shake them up. Pick out
four or five of them and write them down in the order you picked them
on some staff paper. Compose a melody that makes sense of this chord
progression. You can add some passing chords if you like.
3. Lead Exercise 2 to a perfect cadence.
Add chords and melody where needed. Give it a key signature.

Part III: Harmony and Structure 
Jonathan Segel of Camper Van Beethoven
A lot of what I do when I’m teaching people to
play instruments is to show people the relation-
ships between notes and how they relate to
each other. For instance, if you’re showing a
person how to play a song, say on guitar, you
show them which chords they need to play, and
then you ask, “Okay, which are the common
notes in these chords, and how are they related
to each other? What note changes do you need
to make this chord into the next chord?” And
then the melody, you know, the melody is notes
that are also in the chords, or around the notes
that are in the chords. So people ultimately
learn how all the notes in a song are related to
one another.

4. Take any two notes and explore the chord combinations available.
5. Take any two chords and explore the melodic possibilities between
them.
6. Listen to some familiar music and see if you can identify the non-
chord tones by ear.
7. Write a chord progression and extract the structural tones.
8. See how many different non-chord tones you can add and determine
which ones work well for your style of music composition.
9. Invent a whole new melody by removing some of the original struc-
tural tones and leaving the non-chord tones.

here’s going to be a time in your life when you want desperately to sit
down and write a song or a piece of instrumental music, but you find you
just can’t come up with anything. Nada. Zip. A complete and seemingly insur-
mountable case of composer’s block. So, does that mean you should admit
you’ve got nothing left and quit? No way!
Never, ever give up.
One of the keys to being a successful and prolific musician is getting through
these creative dry spells and coming out the other end with either a piece of
finished music, some song lyrics and a melody, or even just a solid beginning,
middle, or ending you can work on in the future. There are many ways to
coax your creative juices out from hiding, including beating your head
against the piano over and over again, a la Guy Smiley from Sesame Street.
In this chapter we discuss two ways of squeezing blood from a turnip: using
the environment around you and using a strange science called effort shapes.

Composing Using the Movement 
Around You
Many musicians, especially pianists, have a secret weapon in their composi-
tion arsenal that they almost never discuss with non-musicians, because it
seems either too matter-of-fact or just silly. When they’re having “dead” peri-
ods of no inspiration, they work on writing mini-soundtracks for the activities
going on around them. For example, a cat walks into the room. What sound
would the cat’s footsteps make if you were trying to capture the image in
music? How about the cat’s voice? Let’s call the cat’s soundtrack Part A.
Now, what if the cat continued on into the kitchen, where your mother, or
brother, or a1950s housewife was cheerfully washing dishes? What would
that soundtrack be? What if the dishwasher was actually your tired, stubble-
faced roommate, who was rather unhappy about washing the dishes? What
would his music sound like? How would both or either of those people react
to the cat? There are your Parts B (the dishwasher) and C (the dishwasher
and the cat) — practically a whole composition waiting for you in this 
scenario.
Look and listen around you. What did you do last night, this morning, whom
did you see, what stories were told? What happened in your dream? Almost
anything can serve as a starting point for some kind of soundtrack. Make a
movie in your head out of the action in your life and then score that movie.
Your soundtrack can be a simple melody line that deftly “haikus” and con-
denses each character — or it may be a full melody with accompaniment.
Capturing the essence of the activities around you in music can actually
result in full-fledged compositions. On the other hand, they can end up as
pieces of music you’ll never use in the real world. The purpose of this idea,
however, is to get you to start playing and writing music again, to work past
your composer’s block. Plus it’s fun, too, and playing music for the fun of it 
is a great way to get your mind to relax and open itself up to new musical
possibilities.
If you think this all sounds too silly to try yourself, try to wrap your head
around this one: Much of Pyotr (Peter) Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s famous score for
the The Nutcracker Suite was composed after the ballet had already been
choreographed. He came in after all the “footwork” was already done and
wrote music to accompany the physical movements of the dancers. The
dancers were his “movie,” and he wrote their soundtrack.
As helpful as this everyday soundtrack idea can be, there is a more system-
atic approach available to you: effort shapes.
126
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Introducing Effort Shapes
A more precise and useful way to describe movement than just walking and
washing dishes is through the language of effort shapes (also called Laban
Movement Analysis or Eukinetics). An effort shape is a style of movement that
incorporates particular uses of weight, time, control, and space. When we
use effort shapes to compose music, we’re trying to capture the emotion and
feel of those movements in the music itself. 
Effort shapes have been used by choreographers since the 1930s, after chore-
ographer Rudolf von Laban published his treatise Kinetographie Laban in
1928, which detailed a system of dance notation that came to be called
Labanotation. Labonation is still used as one of the primary movement nota-
tion systems in dance.
During World War II, Laban fled from Germany to England. The British govern-
ment hired him to observe factory and farm workers, analyze their move-
ments, and devise more efficient procedures for them to follow to improve
productivity. Laban broke down human movements into eight effort shapes.
Used as a tool by dancers, athletes, and physical and occupational thera-
pists, it is one of the most widely used systems of human movement analysis.
His eight effort shapes are also used by acting teachers to help actors define
the behaviors of characterizations they wish to portray, and in the area of
behavioral analysis.
Effort, or what Laban sometimes described as dynamics, is a system for
understanding the more subtle characteristics about the way a movement 
is done with respect to inner intention. The difference between punching
someone in anger and reaching for a glass is slight in terms of body 
organization — both rely on extension of the arm. However, the attention 
to the strength of the movement, the control of the movement, and the timing
of the movement are very different.
Effort has four subcategories, each of which has two opposite polarities:
 Weight: Heavy and light
 Time: Sustained and staccato
 Flow: Bound and free-flowing
 Space: Direct and indirect
127
Chapter 11: Composing from the Void

Laban named the combination of the first three categories (space, weight,
and time) the effort actions, or action drive. Flow, on the other hand, is
responsible for the continuousness or ongoingness of motions. Without any
flow effort, movement must be contained in a single initiation and action,
which is why there are specific names for the flowless action configurations
of effort. In general, it is very difficult to remove Flow from much movement,
and so a full analysis of effort typically needs to go beyond the effort actions.
So, how does this all relate to composing music? Read on.
Weight: heavy versus light
The ideas of heaviness and lightness are easy enough to translate into musical
terms. Something light is usually played softly or gently. Often light, melodic
phrases are played by instruments with higher pitch ranges, but not always.
A French horn can be played lightly or heavily in the low register, for example.
Light and heavy are also related to loud and soft. You might feel like a minor
melody at a slow tempo is heavy by nature, but slow pieces in minor keys can
have either light or heavy qualities. We are talking about light or heavy — not
light or dark. With strings, light and heavy can be communicated through
bowing. The specific articulations of other instruments convey light and
heavy also.
Light and heavy can be expressed through choices of instrumentation as
well. A violin or flute is inherently lighter than a saxophone or a trumpet. A
string quartet may be lighter than a brass ensemble. Of course the composer
can control a wide range of weights within any of these instruments or instru-
ment groupings.
Time: Sustained and staccato
Laban’s terms sustained and staccato mean almost the same things as the
musical terms legato and staccato, but the musical terms refer more exactly
to the general perceived flow of a melody. The notes may not be written
exactly with legato or staccato indications in the sheet music. They may just
come across as more or less smooth and connected or separated and quick.
Writing indications in the actual sheet music works, too, but you don’t always
have to go to this extreme to get the feeling across.
128
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

When staccato is light and direct it can result in Dab, and when it gets heavy
and bound, it might become Punch. Or if the energy is indirect, the light stac-
cato becomes Flick and the heavy becomes Slash. (More on these terms later
in this chapter.)
Flow: Bound and free-flowing
Bound and free-flowing are a little harder to grasp. A melody that is bound
might be one that has very few trills or other ornaments. It would be fairly
controlled and might be played by more than one instrument in unison or
harmony, one instrument “binding” the other to the task of melody making.
A free-flowing melody is a little looser in construction. This is not to say that
it jumps all over the place (that would make it free-flowing and indirect), but
it might make more use of a single instrument’s virtuoso capabilities and not
be so apt to stay a straight and narrow course. A bound melody might seem
ponderous and deliberate, whereas a free-flowing melody rises and falls with
ease and abandonment. In a sense, bound energy doesn’t communicate hap-
piness as well as free-flowing energy does. Bound energy often conveys
sorrow, pride, and determination. Some instruments are more bound or more
free-flowing in general: The clarinet and piano are capable of free-flowing pas-
sages, but the baritone saxophone and bass viol are a bit more bound by
nature. 
Space: Direct and indirect
A direct melody doesn’t get diverted or sidetracked on its way to conclusion.
It might be peppered with trills (playing two adjacent notes of a scale
quickly), mordents (playing three adjacent notes of a scale quickly), and all
manner of nuance, or it might move straight and simply, but it is headed from
the beginning to the end without changing course or getting confused. It
doesn’t beat around the bush. If I want you to give me a ride home, I can say,
“Do you think you could give me a ride home?” Or I could say, “I wonder how
I am going to get home later. I suppose I could walk or take a cab. Is there a
bus that runs later?” That’s the difference between direct and indirect.
Eventually I get home, but the indirect example is a roundabout journey just
to get the ride.
Many composers make efforts to ensure that their melodies are always a little
indirect. Bela Bartok was a great example of this. Mozart was very direct, on
129
Chapter 11: Composing from the Void

the other hand. At a time when listeners demanded that their expectations be
fulfilled musically, it was difficult for composers to write much in the way of
indirect melodies. Direct melodic choices are always the ones that get stuck
in your head. Indirect melodic choices demand your attention and are inter-
esting, but often are soon gone from memory — or rather, they are remem-
bered indirectly. You remember the sense of them without remembering the
exact notes.
Now that you have some sense of what the effort shapes mean, let’s connect
them more directly to composing music.
Composing Using Effort Shapes 
Basically, as we have tried to establish, effort shapes are natural human
styles of movement, and they convey moods and emotions. They are body
language. Any musical phrase or passage can also be broken down into
Laban’s four components and resolved into his eight effort shapes.
The eight effort shapes have been given names, and here we attempt to
describe each shape musically. For the most part, the names of the effort
shapes speak for themselves. It is also easy to see how you can use these
names as a guide for composing music that conveys certain moods. 
Dab
Dab is light, direct, staccato, and free-flowing.
Imagine you’re dabbing something with a paintbrush, or the tip of a wash-
cloth. When you dab, you’re not striking it hard, and you’re not squishing it
flat. You’re gently and quickly poking it.
When you want to capture the feeling of dabbing in your music, you’re going
to play it lightly and quickly — like you’re softly and quickly poking the exact
center of a piano key. You have a musical idea you want to quickly get across
to your listeners, and you’re not going to dance around things to get it
across. But you’re not trying to hit your listeners over the head with it, either.
Mozart wrote a lot of dab music, as do contemporary composers like Toog,
Momus, Henry Purcell, Mr. Wright, and Belle & Sebastian. 
130
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Flick
Flick is light, indirect, staccato, and free-flowing.
Imagine you’re flicking an eyelash off of someone’s cheek with your finger.
You’re not pouncing on that little stray hair to remove it — instead, you’re
aiming at the general direction of the hair, just brushing against the cheek of
the person and the area around the eyelash as well. When you’re trying to
capture the feeling of flicking in your music, you’re quickly and gently hitting
the notes you want to hit, but you’re also playing with the notes around your
core musical idea as well.
Serialism and fugue counterpoint use the concept of flick in their construc-
tion, as do artists such as J. S. Bach, Elf Power, Philip Glass, and Can.
Glide
Glide is light, direct, sustained, and bound.
Imagine a bird gliding, and make your music take on that sound. When you’re
writing music that glides, keep in mind that you’re trying to make music that
soars, just like that bird.
Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker, Brian Eno’s atmospherics, and Arvo Päart all
manage to convey glide.
Press
Press is heavy, direct, sustained, and bound.
Press music does just that — it presses down hard on the listener. This is
you, the composer, pressing down hard on the fly that landed on your key-
board, slowly and with great intent. There’s no misconstruing your musical
concept when you compose in press, which is why almost all heavy goth
music and slowcore fit under this heading.
Wagner, Low, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Canadian folk artist Hayden, This
Mortal Coil, Mogwai, Popol Vuh, and Joy Division all are into press. 
131
Chapter 11: Composing from the Void

Float
Float is light, indirect, sustained, and free-flowing.
Float is a lot like glide, except that it is less direct.
Think Claude Debussy and Stereolab. 
Punch
Punch is heavy, direct, staccato, and bound.
This is the most direct and aggressive-sounding music of the bunch. When
you write music with punch, you’re telling your audience that you have a
message and you want them to hear it right now. You’re punching out the
notes on your instrument — if you’re playing the piano, you’re hitting the
keys directly and with force.
Music with punch includes Stravinsky, The Ramones, Sir Mix-a-Lot, 
P. J. Harvey — and basically, for that matter, most rock and rap music.
Slash
Slash is heavy, indirect, staccato, and free-flowing.
Slash is a lot like punch, except that the message and the sound aren’t ham-
mered so much into the audience. You’re toying with the audience a bit,
putting them just a bit on edge and catching them by surprise with your
musical and rhythmic choices.
Think Stravinsky, The Swans, Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie, Jarboe, and
Akron/Family. 
Wring
Wring is heavy, indirect, sustained, and bound.
Think of wringing out a washcloth, and you’ve got the basic idea behind what
you’re trying to do to your audience when you use this effort shape. You’re
132
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

slowly wringing them out emotionally while moving to your musical climax,
potentially exhausting them with the sheer effort of moving to the end of the
song or the section of music.
Think Holst, Bartok, Legendary Pink Dots, The Swans, Throbbing Gristle,
Popol Vuh, and Godspeed You Black Emperor.
Shaping story and mood by 
combining effort shapes
Your composition tells a story. Using effort shapes, you can decide on the
moods of your story and the order in which you want to present them, and
then you can write heavy, light, direct, indirect, and so on to get the moods
across to the listener. You can use a change of effort shape to develop or
restate a motif or melodic phrase.
Just as there are a lot of ways to say, “I love you,” there are also many ways to
present any melodic idea. A single phrase can be arranged to sound sus-
tained or staccato. You can take any musical idea and frame it into an effort
shape with surprisingly little difficulty using choices of orchestration, tempo,
the octave in which the melody is played, or almost anything else you like.
The effort shapes just give you handy, pre-packaged combinations of ingredi-
ents to get your message across.
A good way to get a grasp on composition is to listen for these effort shapes
in the music of others. They are everywhere. Although composers don’t often
use them consciously, it is difficult to find a single moment in music that can’t
be assigned one or more effort shapes. Most musical compositions move
back and forth between a couple different effort shapes. Some music stays
pretty much on a single one. And some compositions run almost the entire
gamut of them. This is true for tonal music, atonal music, popular, hip-hop,
jazz, metal, classical, and so on. Some genres of music are almost entirely
characterized by single effort shapes. There is a good deal of Punch and Dab
in hip-hop, a lot of Slash in metal, and Press in rock and roll. Jazz uses a lot of
Glide, Float, and Flick energy.
Consider Gustav Holst’s The Planets (op. 32). To follow along, you may have
to go out and get a recording of this orchestral suite. But if you don’t have it
already, you should anyway. Elsewhere is this book we have mentioned that
many modern film composers seem to have been influenced by this composi-
tion. Maybe a reason for its influence is that Holst moves us through so many
different moods — or effort shapes. 
133
Chapter 11: Composing from the Void

The string entrance is flick with a little suggestion of slash. The brass enters
with a heavy dab leading to punch. A few punches, then some more dab, a
little slash and wring leading to another punch, and we’re back to dab and
punch. More dabs leading to punch followed by press when the melody
smooths out. Then it speeds up into slash and punch and holds as a little bit
of a lighter wring. The main melody that comes in later in the low strings is
press. This melody is (all together now!) heavy, direct, sustained, and bound.
After this we go back to dab and flick till we hit punch again. You can take it
from there.
Notice that more than one effort-shape can be happening at the same time.
The strings can play flick and slash or wring while the brass plays a press/
dab melody.
Make sure you listen to “Neptune” to hear the contrast to what you heard in
“Jupiter.” “Neptune” has a lot of float and some glide energy mixed with a
little wring here and there.
If you want to hear a composition with some obvious slash and punch energy,
listen to Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. 
Human moods are expressed through body language, and styles of movement
are defined by effort shapes. Music is expressive of moods through its move-
ments through time and space by way of its rhythms and melodies. The effort
shapes codify movements and give us the tools to translate physical, human
movement and body language into music. 
When we began this chapter, we suggested that you look at your daily life as
a movie. And when composing for film, it is important to observe the rela-
tionships between movement styles, cultural and socioeconomic frame-
works, and the music you compose. It can be a dangerous stretch to use
contemporary sounds and styles to score a film about, say, Elizabethan
England. 
Remember that you yourself move with a certain combination of weight,
speed, directness, and so on. This combination might influence your likes
and dislikes and even the style of your compositions. That’s fine, but you
shouldn’t be bound by your own natural combination. If you want to enjoy
sustained success as a music composer, you will need to learn to embrace a
broader variety of movement styles (see Holst’s The Planets). If you are lucky,
you could become successful by virtue of your stylistic limitations — just
realize that if so, it might limit how much variety you can get away with 
later on.

Chapter 11: Composing from the Void
Mods dab, rockers press
In the 1960s, during what contemporary musi-
cologists like to call “The First British Invasion,”
British youth formed two cultures. These two
youth cultures were known as the rockers and
the mods. The rockers might enjoy the music of
The Rolling Stones or The Animals, and the
mods might prefer The Beatles or Herman’s
Hermits. The cultures clashed in their interest in
music, clothing, their preferred uses of drugs
and alcohol to some extent, and their general
attitudes. There were occasional gang-like turf
wars between the two groups, as portrayed in
the classic film Quadrophenia. To a certain
extent, a similar division existed among young
people in the big cities of the United States
(such as between the Foamies and the Pot-
suckers on the East Coast in the 1960s.). 
It is interesting to note that most of the music
that interested the mods can be classified as
dab/glide, but the rockers seemed to prefer
press/punch. Of course, there was music that
crossed these lines, and other effort shapes can
be observed in the music enjoyed by these two
groups, but the social implications of this clear
division of effort shapes between these groups
suggest that certain types of people might be
attracted to certain types of movement in their
music. Moreover, certain types of movements in
music may seem to fit with certain types of cul-
tural frameworks.
In 1967, the Rolling Stones, in an attempt to
make an album that spoke to the psychedelic
influence of bands like the Beatles, recorded
Their Satanic Majesties Request. It was deeply
disliked by most of the Stones’ rocker listener
base, but it did cross over into the realm of ten-
uous acceptance by many of the mods. People
expected the Stones’ usual punch/press rock
and roll, but got glide, dab, and float. It was the
Rolling Stones’ least successful album, from
which they were mandated to redeem them-
selves with their very next release.

5. Pick any two effort shapes and try to write a 16-measure transition
from one to the other.
6. Try to write a short musical beginning (intro) using each of the eight
effort shapes.
7. Do the same thing as Exercise 6, but write endings (finales).

Chapter 12
Beginnings, Middles, and Endings 
In This Chapter
 Discussing the importance of form
 Beginning a piece of music
 Mucking around in the middle
 Ending with resolution
T
he fact that a good composition is like a good story, with a beginning, a
middle, and an end, is easy enough to tell in a song with lyrics. This is
especially true in folk songs, and especially folk ballads, which are most often
specifically written to tell a story. Consider Peter, Paul and Mary’s “Puff the
Magic Dragon,” which, if taken literally, tells the listeners about the relation-
ship between a boy and his dragon.
This narrative property of music is universal and extremely important in
composition.
Even instrumental songs can — and should — tell a story, too. In an instru-
mental piece of music, you have a clearly defined beginning that grabs your
attention and sets the overall tone of the songs, a middle that tells the story
of the song, and an ending designed to wrap up the story and end in cadence.
That may sound simplistic, but it really is how most music is structured,
whether you’re talking about a sonata, a folk ballad, or a punk anthem.
Many times, instrumental songs are fitted to a poem or a set of lyrics. In the
end the words are simply removed by the composer with the intent that the
overall meaning of the words should still be conveyed by the music alone.
Many classical composers wrote music this way, including Johannes Brahms
and Ludwig van Beethoven. Brahms actually left the lyrics in many of his
compositions, only to have them performed, for the most part, as purely
instrumental pieces.

A Word About Form
While the idea of composing within a form may feel claustrophobic and non-
creative to some musicians from the outset, it’s form that ties a piece of
music together and keeps it from feeling like aimless noodling. In short, form
is beginning, middle, and end. It’s a map to follow when trying to put a song
together. All art is built on shape, and music is no exception.
For example, if you want to write blues music, you need to write within the
constraints of the blues form. Again, here’s where sitting down at an instru-
ment and just playing around with chord progressions works wonders for
creativity. Humming along with a couple of bars of I-IV-V/I is half the work of
writing a solid blues song. It’s similar with pop music — there’s a conven-
tional formula for that, known as the Intro ABACBCB form, as you can see in
Chapter 13. Just playing around within the constraints of a form can give you
some great basic ideas of how you want to put your song together. 
When you’re working with pop songs, even instrumental ones such as those
performed by bands such as Tortoise and Trans Am, you work to arrange the
song under some version of the pop form, such as (Intro ABACBCB) or one of
the other traditional patterns of songwriting in the pop genre.
Many classical forms are actually several musical forms stuck together, such
as symphonies, rondos, and sonatas. In these forms, it’s almost as though
you’re writing several smaller pieces of music and putting them together into
one big piece. In one piece of music, remember, you can even have multiple
time signatures and multiple key signatures. In these kinds of classical music,
having an engaging opening sequence is even more important, because the
beginning and the ending are even more responsible than in other forms for
tying the music together into a coherent whole.
Beginnings
Imagine someone listening skeptically to a new CD. He puts it in the player
and presses Play. Within three seconds he wrinkles his nose and skips to the
next track. Five seconds later he sighs and skips to the next one.
That scenario illustrates how crucial the beginning of your music is. But even
before the beginning is the title.
138
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

The power of titling
Talk to any punk rock band — for example, we talked to the guys from
Dillinger 4 for this one — and they’ll tell you that “all you have to do to write
a song is come up with a good title.” Many, many brainstorming sessions with
rock bands in general are consumed with discussions on finding the perfect
title for a new song. Hundreds of titles might be thrown out during these ses-
sions, until one wonderful title — such as “Kim Gordon’s Panties” (Steve
Albini), Camper Van Beethoven’s “When I Win the Lottery,” or, theoretically, if
Maurice Ravel was a pop band and not a classical composer, “Pavanne for a
Dead Princess” — carries enough weight on its own to turn into a song. 
This might sound silly, but the point of coming up with a title for a song that
doesn’t exist is to kickstart the creative juices and get you on the path to
actually writing music. Many writers do the same thing when sitting down to
write a poem, short story, or even a novel — they come up with a title for a
project and then sit down and try to come up with a story, poem, or novel
that works under that title. Once you have the title for a song, you can sit
down and start thinking of what the title means to you, how it makes you feel,
and, eventually, what kind of music and/or lyrics you think would go with
that title.
For example, if you hear the phrase “starry, starry night,” do you think of
loud, rough, fast music — or something slow and quiet and sentimental?
Most people would say the latter is the case. What about the word “hoe-
down”? Something sprightly, danceable, and possibly ironic would probably
be the case.
Words have the amazing power of bringing up a panoply of images when
spoken or read, and working with titles is a quick way to get you in the right
frame of mind to compose.
Starting a piece
The beginning of a piece of music should do one or more of the following
things:
 Set the mood of the piece
 Introduce a musical idea
 Get the listener’s attention
139
Chapter 12: Beginnings, Middles, and Endings

In many cases, the very first set of chords or notes is the most important part
of the song. Your opening musical phrase is just like the opening phrase of a
good book or story, and you should strive to instantly suck your listener into
the song with a memorable opener.
Think of Claude Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” Gioachino Rossini’s William Tell
Overture (as immortalized in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange and in
The Lone Ranger), or Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5. These all feature openers
that just about everyone in the Western world is familiar with. And although
it’s extremely rare for a musician or writer to put that kind of lasting punch
into a composition, it’s something to strive for when you write music and
lyrics. 
Chord progressions
Just playing around with chord progressions (see Chapter 10) can be enough
to build the basic foundation of a song and figure out how you’re musically
going to begin it, no matter what the genre. You can get a lot of good songs
started off from just sitting down at your instrument and doing four or five
bars of I-V-I chords over and over, as in C major, G major, C major or A major,
E major, A major.
Try sitting down and humming along with these chord progressions for
awhile and see if you can’t either come up with your own song or hear some-
one else’s very familiar song coming out.
The greatest compositions are often surprisingly simple in structure.
Middles
It has been said that people remember the beginning and ending of your
song, but they forget all about the middle. Nevertheless, the middle is usually
the biggest part of a composition and deserves attention and development.
Just as in a work of written fiction, the middle is where you develop the state-
ment first presented in the beginning. If you present a problem in the lyrics,
such as in Mozart’s Don Giovanni, in which the lead character laments that he’s
always “running errands, never free . . . this is not the life for me” (translated
from the Italian for your reading pleasure), then in the middle of the piece you
140
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

would reveal or describe the character’s plans to lead a completely different
life — which, in the case of Don Giovanni, has disastrous consequences.
In many of Hank Williams’s songs, the middle is used to lyrically describe
exactly how much agony the main character of the song is in, building on the
idea presented in the beginning of the song. “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” “Ramblin’
Man,” and “Cold, Cold Heart” are just three Hank Williams songs that follow
this exact pattern. Here we could easily speculate that Mr. Williams came up
with the catchy title, fiddled around with basic chords and got an idea for a
tune to go with it, and developed the song’s middle based on fleshing out the
idea of a “cheatin’ heart.” Sounds simple, eh?
In classical music, the middle section serves as a counterbalance to the
beginning. The middle is where you change keys and/or tempo, defining a
clear break from the opening section of your piece. If a piece of classical
music has a loud, forceful beginning section, then the middle section is often
quieter and more subdued to provide stark contrast to the opening. Consider
Igor Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms. Conversely, if the music starts out
slowly and simply, then a good way to present contrast is — can you 
guess? — to have a forceful, complicated middle section, as in Frederic
Chopin’s Étude in A Minor (op. 25, no. 11).
As in storytelling — and pretty much any kind of narrative, from fairy tales 
to Hollywood movies — the beginning establishes a baseline situation; the
middle takes us on a journey away from that baseline, employing change and
adventure; and the ending brings us back to another baseline, which is usu-
ally at least slightly different from the beginning.
Endings
Even television jingles have a beginning, middle, and ending. The ending of
anything should be a satisfying conclusion to the piece. Musically, you proba-
bly want your songs to end in cadence, or resolving to the I chord (as dis-
cussed in Chapter 10) just because that is an aurally satisfying way for a
piece of music to end. Lyrically, you want to try to either answer some of the
questions posited in your beginning, resolve the situation(s) developed in the
middle, or even just have the song’s narrator or main character give up and
move to something else. It’s just like in literature — at the end of the story,
something has been resolved. 
141
Chapter 12: Beginnings, Middles, and Endings

In general, the overall length of a piece is dependent on the ability to keep
the listener’s interest throughout. Compositions involving relatively simple
ideas should be short in length — you can’t just repeat a theme or motif over
and over and over and expect your listener to stay awake. Compositions with
many complex ideas should naturally be longer and more developed so that
the listener is satisfied that the piece is complete.
Exercises
1. Come up with a simple statement such as I love you, Life is a mystery,
or This job sucks. Write a melody to go along with it. 
2. Develop your idea from Exercise 1.
For example: If you had written This job sucks, you might write some-
thing like, The printer didn’t work all week. Give a little detail to your
original statement and then a little more. Put this new idea to music.
3. Write something that contrasts or departs slightly from your original
theme, such as I hope we still have email.
142
Part III: Harmony and Structure 
Making your music “breathe”
The beginning, middle, and end of a piece of
music should all be looked at as its sections,
and those sections should be viewed as being
composed of musical phrases. 
Phrases are complete musical thoughts that
also have a beginning, a middle, and an end to
them, and this is what gives music shape.
Phrases are usually short, often two to eight
measures long, and generally end in a cadence.
Cadences provide a sort of musical pause
within the piece of music, giving the sense that
the music is breathing as tension is increased
and decreased between points of cadence —
there’s a lot more on building musical phrases
in Chapter 7.
When listening to music, if you have a hard time
telling where one phrase or period begins and
another ends, don’t despair. Music that contains
only very clear phrases often sounds square,
simple, and, frankly, boring. Therefore, com-
posers are always finding ways to obscure the
beginnings and endings of phrases so that one
phrase blends smoothly into the next and car-
ries the listener easily along with it. Very often,
one part of the music (for example, the melody)
will come to the end of the phrase while another
part of the music (for example, the accompani-
ment) has already started the next one. That is
one way to “blur” phrases. Cadences can be
considered to be any method for completing a
musical thought and coming to a moment of rest
before moving onto another musical thought.

4. Write an ending for the preceding two exercises. For example, I sent a
memo to my boss saying, ‘see you in Cancun’. Put this idea to music.
5. Write a short melodic phrase with no lyrics of about four measures.
Leave the ending hanging. In other words, don’t resolve it back to the
I chord.
6. Write your phrase from exercise 4 again, but this time resolve the
ending with a cadence.
If you want, you can change a few notes or the direction of melodic
movement a little, but be sure it is basically the same phrase as 
Exercise 5.
7. Try to write a complementary or contrasting musical phrase as a
departure from Exercise 6.
For example, maybe move your underlying chord up a fourth.
8. Find a way to restate your original phrase as an ending, resolving the
piece back to the I chord at the end.
9. Analyze the form of three of your favorite pieces of music, writing the
part letters (A, B, C, and so on) on a blank piece of paper as you listen.

Musical Forms

 Checking out popular forms: blues, country, and rock 
 Stepping out into atonal music
W
hen we talk about musical form, what we’re talking about, of course, is
the blueprint used to create a specific type of music. For example, if
you wanted to sit down and write a minuet, there is a very specific blueprint
you have to follow to create a piece of music that musicians and other listen-
ers would recognize as a minuet. You can write a blues piece and call it
“Minuet in B,” or “Sad Minuet” — but it wouldn’t really be a minuet. It would
still be the blues.
There are many different musical forms, and each one is composed of different
parts that come together to define the whole.
Combining Parts into Forms
The division of music into parts is convenient when your composition, like
most compositions, requires repetition of various similar elements. The dif-
ferent parts usually share a major harmonic focus point, similar melody lines,
rhythm structure, and may have other resemblances. Parts can further be
linked to create identifiable musical forms (blues, rock, and so on).
Conventional musical theory gives alphabetic labels to the musical parts
within a composition: A, B, C, and so forth. If a part is repeated in a song, its
letter is repeated. For example, ABA is familiar in classical music, with an
opening theme (A) that leads to a chorus or bridge (Part B) and is repeated
at the end of the piece (A again). 

One-part form: A
The one-part form — diagrammed as just A, or AA, or AAA, depending on the
length of the song — is the most primitive song structure, sometimes referred
to as the air or ballad form. In a one-part form, a melody is repeated with only
slight changes (if any) in each successive verse of the round to accommodate
the changing rhythm of the song, such as in “Happy Birthday” or “The Hokey
Pokey.”
Binary form: AB
Binary form consists of two contrasting sections that function as statement
and counterstatement. It can be as simple as just AB, as in “My Country ‘Tis
of Thee.” It can also be a bit more expanded — AABB — as in “Greensleeves,”
with the second A being a variation of the first A (as shown in Figure 13-1).

Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Song form: ABA
Song structure is frequently based on the ABA form, also called three-part
form or ternary/tertiary form. One of the simplest ways to write in song form
is to simply vary and repeat the melody, as in “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”
(Figure 13-2).
More complicated uses of ABA appears in classical forms.
See if you can find the A and B sections in Figure 13-2. Go on, we’ll wait.
(If you said the first four measures were part A, the second four measures
were part B, and the final four measures were part A again, you were right. If
not, you should probably start this chapter over again.)
Another variation of the ABA form is the AABA form, which is used in the
blues (more on this later in this chapter) and in popular songs such as 
“Over the Rainbow,” with the B section working as the bridge linking the 
two stretches of A. 
Arch form: ABCBA
Music written in arch form is made up of parts labeled A, B, and C. In arch form,
the A, B, and C are played sequentially — and then the B section is played for a
second time, followed by the A to end the song. It looks like this: ABCBA.
The 20th-century Hungarian composer Béla Bartók used the arch form for
many of his compositions, such as in his Piano Concerto No. 2 and Violin
Concerto No. 2.

Chapter 13: Musical Forms

Classical Forms 
Before the Renaissance period, most Western music was composed for reli-
gious purposes or for people to dance to, and because people didn’t always
want to learn a new dance to go along with a new kind of music, the rhythm
and ideas behind folk music stayed pretty constant and unchanging. The con-
cept of form wasn’t really recognized until the height of the classical era —
from around 1700 to 1850 — when composers began actively trying to create
new forms to break convention and to wow the competition and audiences
alike.
Classical music is chock-full of forms. We don’t have room to go into them all
in detail, but here is a look at a few of them.
The sonata 
The sonata (also called the sonata-allegro form) was the most popular form
used by instrumental composers from the mid 1700s all the way up until the
beginning of the 20th century. The sonata is considered to be the first true
break from the Church music that had earmarked Western music from the
Medieval to the Baroque periods. Ludwig van Beethoven and J. S. Bach are
two of the most popular composers to use this format, with Beethoven having
written literally dozens of pieces of music in sonata style. 
Sonatas are based on the song, or ABA, form. The first A is the exposition,
which presents the main theme of the song, as well as two or three other
minor themes. A good example of the sonata form is Beethoven’s Piano
Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor, also known as the “Moonlight” Sonata
(Figure 13-3).
The second part, or B part, of a sonata is called the development. The devel-
opment often sounds like it belongs in an entirely different piece of music
altogether—it is usually in a different key and may have a different time 
signature than the exposition (Figure 13-4).

Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Note the different key and time signature used in the B part shown in 
Figure 13-4, compared to the A part in Figure 13-3. 
The third part of the sonata, of course, is the return to the theme or themes
explored in the first A section. It is called the recapitulation. 
Like a lot of musical forms, the sonata has its roots in language — in this case,
the sonnet. In a sonnet, the first quatrain (four-line verse) consists of two sets
of rhyming pairs (in music, this could be an A part), whereas the second verse
consists of two completely different sets of rhyming pairs (a B section). The
third verse goes back to the rhyming scheme of the A section, the fourth fol-
lows the rhyming scheme of the B section, and so on. Shakespeare, of course,
was/is the reigning king of the sonnet. 
The rondo 
In a rondo, the idea of linking completely different-sounding pieces of music
is taken even further than in the sonata. The formula for a rondo is ABACA
for five-part rondo, and ABACADA for seven-part rondo — the two main kinds
of rondo. Meaning, of course, that the A section, sometimes called the refrain,
is the only thing really tying the piece of music together, and the B, C, and D
parts (sometimes called episodes) can be in most any key or time signature
you want. Mozart was a fine example of a composer that utilized the rondo,
such as in the final movement of his Sonata in A Major, the Ronda alla Turca
section.
The rondo also has its roots in poetry. In 13th century France, the rondeau was
an incredibly popular form of street poetry and was often set to music. In a
rondeau, each new stanza has a completely different rhyming scheme, rhyth-
mic structure, and even stanza length than the one that came before, with the
exception that the opening rhyme scheme (A) is returned to at the beginning
of each new stanza.

Chapter 13: Musical Forms

Concerto
In a concerto, a composer explores contrasts — between having a large
ensemble playing a section of music and then having a soloist or a much
smaller group present the same or a very similar section of music. It’s with
this type of arrangement that we get our superstars of classical music, such
as pianist Lang Lang and violinists Itzhak Perlman and Alban Berg. The soloists
often carry as much weight as the long-dead composers themselves do.
Symphony
A symphony is a melding of several different musical forms and is usually 
performed by an orchestra. There are traditionally four movements in a 
symphony:
 Sonata allegro
 Slower movement
 Minuet or scherzo
 Combination of sonata and rondo, a thematic repeat of the first movement
This is just one configuration, however. The true idea behind a symphony is
that it combines several different musical forms into one piece of music har-
moniously. Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 is perhaps the most universally rec-
ognized symphony ever written.
Fugue
The fugue was the first musical form to fully utilize the left hand of the pianist.
In this form, the treble clef and the bass clef take turns carrying the melodic
line of the music. Bach, who was a southpaw himself, invented the technique
of counterpoint, which led to the development of the fugue. 
Divertimento
A divertimento is a light, short form of instrumental chamber music having
several very short movements. As its name implies, composers wrote pieces
in this style chiefly for the entertainment value. 
150
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

Minimalism
Minimalist music is a modern music form marked by extreme simplification of
rhythms, patterns, and harmonies, prolonged chordal or melodic repetitions,
and often a trancelike effect. Minimalist music could be diagrammed as
AAAAA... form, where each new A is only very slightly changed from the 
preceding A. Philip Glass is one of the best-known composers who use 
the minimalist form. 
Through-composed
Through-composed music is a song structure that presents new material in
each new section of the composition, with no repetition of themes. Each
verse of a through-composed composition has its own unique melody, which
can be in a different key or even have a different time signature. Classical
composers of through-composed composition include Nicholae Bretan and
Schubert, whereas more modern examples can be found in Andrew Lloyd
Webber operas and in the music of Tenacious D.
Popular Forms 
Discussing form when talking about popular music is tricky, simply because
what we consider popular music has only been around for about 100 years,
with more recent stylistic innovations in rock music being only about 20
years old. As a law must first be introduced as a bill, and most bills never
become laws, so a form usually starts out as a genre. Generally, a significant
amount of time has to pass for us to see whether a genre has enough lasting
power or influence for a true form to emerge.
There may be some debate about whether the blues, country, and rock music
are forms or genres. We will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that,
for our purposes in this book, they are forms.
The blues 
The blues is one of the first original American forms of music, combining ele-
ments of field holler, gospel, and African percussion. The blues is written in
song form (ternary/tertiary) and follows an AABA pattern of I, IV, and V
chords in a given scale, with the B section serving as the bridge.
All blues music hinges around the I/i, the IV/iv, and the V/v chords. 
151
Chapter 13: Musical Forms

12-bar blues
The most common type of blues is the 12-bar blues, which is often constructed
like this:
I
I
I
I
IV
IV
I
I
V 
IV
I
V/I (turnaround) 
The turnaround is the part of the song where you either end the song on the I
chord, or play the V chord instead and return to the beginning of the song for
another verse. 
If you’re playing the 12-bar blues in a minor key, you could write it like so: 
i
IV
i
v
IV
IV
i
VI
ii
v
i
v/i (turnaround) 
Another way you could write the 12-bar blues in a minor key is as follows: 
i
i
i
i
iv
iv
i
i
V
iv
i
V/i
8-bar blues
The 8-bar blues is very similar to the 12-bar blues — it’s just got shorter
verses. One possible construction of the 8-bar blues is as follows:
I
IV
I
VI
ii
V
I
V/I (turnaround) 
16-bar blues
The 16-bar blues — which is, of course, four bars longer per verse than the
12-bar blues — follows the chord patterns of the 12-bar blues, with the 9th
and 10th measures (bars) often repeated three times, like so: 
I
I
I
I
IV
IV
I
I
V
IV

152

24-bar blues
The 24-bar blues progression is very similar to the 12-bar form, except that
the time each chord progression is played is doubled, like so:

32-bar blues and country 
The 32-bar blues is the direct link between blues and rock and jazz music. This
kind of blues has the AABA structure that was later adopted by rock bands in
the 1960s (see the next section).
Although this form didn’t work as well for blues as the shorter forms did,
simply because it didn’t work as well for the call-and-response form of lyri-
cism that the blues was built on, it worked very well for early country music.
Hank Williams used this form in songs like “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” and Freddy
Fender used it in “Wasted Days and Wasted Nights.” Later, this form was
picked up and popularized by mainstream musicians and could be heard in
songs like “Frosty the Snowman.” 
Rock 
In the 1960s, the Beach Boys used the 32-bar blues form for songs like “Good
Vibrations” and “Surfer Girl” (AABA). Led Zeppelin used it for “Whole Lotta
Love.” The Righteous Brothers used it for “You’ve Lost that Loving Feeling,”
except that instead of using 32 bars, the turnaround happens at the 24th bar.
Compound AABA
Other bands took the 32-bar blues form and turned it into the compound 32-
bar blues form, or compound AABA form — which sounds like a wart remover,
but it’s not. In compound AABA form, after you play the first 32 bars, you go
to a second bridge and then repeat the first 32 bars again. The Police’s “Every
Breath You Take” and Boston’s “More Than a Feeling,” for a couple examples,
follow this pattern. 
153
Chapter 13: Musical Forms

Verse-chorus
Today, the most widely used form in pop music is the verse-chorus form.
Verse-chorus pop songs are laid out like this: Intro ABACBCB.
 Introduction: The introduction is usually instrumental and sets the
mood of the piece. It can also be a short spoken piece, as in Prince’s
“Let’s Go Crazy.”
 A (verse): Begins the story of the song. 
 B (chorus): The hook of the song, both lyrically and musically. Should be
the most memorable, anthemic part of the song. Is often the title, too.
 A (verse): Part two of the story. 
 B (chorus): Reinforcing the hook by repetition. This is one reason why it
becomes so memorable.
 C (bridge): The bridge can be instrumental or lyrical and is different-
sounding than the verse or chorus sections. 
 B (end, chorus): Repeat chorus to fade or just stop at the I chord
(cadence) after one time through.
Next time you’ve got the radio on, see how many pop songs follow this exact
formula. Perhaps the most amazing thing you’ll find is not that so many songs
are built exactly the same way, but how different these songs sound from
each other despite being built the same way. 
So far we have gone over most of the major forms in Western music. But
besides the familiar scales and modes — beyond the world of do, re, mi — lies
a whole other land of possibilities. Outside of the confines of key signatures
and all the other conventions of tonal (traditional) music is a vast universe
limited only by the constraints of time, imagination, technique, and the twelve
semitones, or half steps, into which the Western octave is divided. It is a uni-
verse filled with accidentals and experimentation, sublimities and absurdities,
some stuff that works — and some stuff that just doesn’t. 
Jazz
The true spirit of jazz has always been improvisation, which makes calling jazz
a “form” most difficult. The goal in jazz is to create a new interpretation of an
established piece (called a standard) — or to build on an established piece of
music by changing the melody, harmonies, or even the time signature. 
The closest thing to defining jazz form is to take the basic idea behind blues
vocalizations — the call-and-response vocals — and replace the voices with
the various instruments that make up the jazz canon: brass, bass, percussive,
154
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

and wind instruments. In Dixieland jazz, for example, musicians take turns
playing the lead melody on their instruments while the others improvise
countermelodies.
The one predictable element of a piece of jazz music — with the exclusion of
free jazz — is the rhythm. All jazz, with the exception of free jazz, uses clear
regular meter and strongly-pulsed rhythms that can be heard through the
music. 
Atonal Music
To the uninitiated listener, atonal music can sound like chaotic, random noise.
However, once you realize the amount of knowledge, skill, and technical
expertise required to compose it or perform it, your tune may change, so 
to speak. 
Actually, very little music is completely tonal in nature, and most atonal music
arrives at and departs from tonality from time to time during its course.
Atonality is a condition of music in which the constructs of the music do not
live within the confines of a particular key signature or scale (other than the
chromatic scale). No particular modes are employed. 
When talking about atonal music, composition instructor Mike Bogle likes to
jokingly refer to the “88 major modes of the chromatic scale.” You would be
hard pressed to label most atonal music “major” or “minor.” These terms are
confined to the realm of tonality.
In tonal music, one tone functions as a sort of center of gravity, and the other
tones in the chromatic scale are “attracted” to it in varying degrees of strength.
Not so in atonal music. There is no gravity. You are allowed to use any of the
twelve tones in the chromatic scale in any way you feel like. But how do you
wrap a sense of form around that amount of freedom?
Atonality and form
In 1908, pianist Arnold Schoenberg became the first known composer to write
a purely atonal composition. “Du lehnest wider eine Silberweide” (“You lean
against a silver-willow”) was the 13th song in his musical collection entitled
Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten (The Book of the Hanging Gardens), op. 15. It
was during this time that he first defined a 12-tone system of composition to
replace tonality as an organizational tool. Atonality is one of the most impor-
tant movements in 20th century music.
155
Chapter 13: Musical Forms

In this 12-tone system, Schoenberg believed that no tone should be more
important than another in a musical composition. All 12 tones were to be
introduced in an order chosen by the composer. Throughout the composi-
tion, these same tones must recur in the same order in notes or chords. No
tone can recur until all eleven other tones in the series (or tone row) have
recurred. 
There were a few accepted modifications to this rule. For example, you could
move all the tones up or down by a certain interval, retaining the interval
relationships of the original series. You could even go in reverse (retrograde). 
This was also the beginning of serial music, or serialism, a type of musical
composition based on a particular sequence of pitches, rhythms, dynamics,
or any other element of music that is repeated over and over again through-
out the composition.
You don’t have to use Schoenberg’s 12-tone system to compose atonal music,
and you don’t have to write serial music either, but it may be useful to have
some framework other than a key center to help you out. 
Atonality and instrument realities
One good idea in music composition is to write for an instrument or instru-
ments that you have a strong technical knowledge of — it is much easier to
write for a violin if you know what the violin is capable of as an instrument.
When composing tonal music, the melody and key center are anchors. Atonal
music can tap into the virtuoso skills of an accomplished musician if you
know the possibilities and limitations of his or her instrument. Certain leaps
of intervals, lengths of phrases, speed of articulation, and musical range and
expression are possible for one instrument but not for another. A cellist can
play an extended legato phrase for endless measures without a pause; a
trombonist needs to take a breath now and then. The trombonist can provide
expression through power and dynamics; the cellist does that through the
many variations of bowing technique.
Strange as it may seem, the timbre of instruments is probably more of an
important consideration when writing atonal music. Atonal music doesn’t
provide the listener with an easy pathway through a set of comfortable
expectations. Each new note can be a new statement, development, or resolu-
tion. If you want to enjoy atonal music, you will have to place your undivided
attention on it. It isn’t something that makes much sense as background
music. You will never hear it playing in an elevator or at the grocery store. 
156
Part III: Harmony and Structure 

If you are careful about what music you expect from which instruments in
your composition, you could write atonally using improvisation as your com-
positional source. You can record your improvisations and then transcribe
them later or, better yet, perform them into a sequencing program such as
Logic Pro or Finale and let the program generate a score (see Chapter 2 for
more). That way you can preserve some of your spontaneous sparks of 
intuition, but clean up the messy stuff before you print it all out. When 
improvising atonally, remember to be respectful of the nature of the particu-
lar instrument that you have in mind to actually perform the part later. Of
course, you could audition the sounds of many different instrument choices
later if you use one of these MIDI sequencing programs. What might not have
worked for a guitar might end up being a great part for the clarinet. 
Atonal Music and You
You can use many of the compositional tools that you use for tonal music while
working atonally. You could start with some structural tones and then add
some passing tones, and so on. You could decide whether you want your
melody to ascend or descend. You could make choices regarding step-wise or
skip-wise melodic movement. You could fill in your notes around some rhyth-
mic phrases. You could extract your melodic ideas from language or nature —
after all, most of the sounds in the world around us are atonal. 
Or how about changing a tonal melody into an atonal gem? To illustrate this
idea, Figure 13-5 shows “Mary Had a Little Lamb” with a few changes to make
it atonal.
From here, you can expand the piece by asking yourself some questions:
What would the accompaniment to this sound like? Do chords exist in atonal
music land? Of course they do. Remember that a chord is just a combination
of notes played together.

157
Chapter 13: Musical Forms

Sometimes figuring out what to call a particular chord can be a challenge
when working in the atonal realm because often a single combination of
notes played together can have more than one possible chord name. For
instance, there are really only three separate combinations of four pitches
required to form all twelve diminished chords. The pitches in a C diminished
chord are the same as the pitches in the E flat (D sharp), F sharp (G flat), and
A diminished chords. They are just different inversions (Figure 13-6).
If you need to write down chord charts for atonal compositions, you should
try to determine if you are in the neighborhood of some tonal movement that
might suggest what to call the chord. Remember that purely atonal music is
rare, and often resolves into tonality from time to time. You could also use
the bass note being played at that moment (if there is one) as a root for
naming your chord. Or you can determine which chord name makes the most
sense in terms of movement between the chord before and the chord after
the chord in question. You could also just pick what seems to be the simplest
name for it. This is especially useful when writing chord charts out for gui-
tarists, since they can rarely play all of the pitches within a complex chord
anyway and usually end up playing a portion of these chords that might have
a simpler name.
Listening for atonality 
Some composers can hear atonal melodies in their heads just as easily as they
can hear tonal ones. This kind of musical imagination is somewhat rare, but if
you have it, great! Don’t be afraid to get it down somehow. Write it, record it,
seal it in a jar. If you think it sounds good and you can communicate it so that
others can eventually hear it, it may have a place in the world — no matter
how weird it may seem to your relatives.

Part III: Harmony and Structure 

To hear some atonal music, we suggest listening to any of Bela Bartok’s string
quartets or Charles Ives’s Symphony No. 4, for starters. These pieces have
some tonal, some bitonal, and some atonal moments in them.
Don’t be afraid to try a little atonality mixed in with your tonal compositions
to add a little spice to the mix.
Exercises
1. Come up with a short melodic line and try writing a one-part form
song. Repeat your A part three times and modify each new verse just
a little bit. 
2. Take a different melodic line you’ve composed from an earlier chap-
ter and call it B. Try writing a binary-form composition (ABAB) using
your A verse from the previous exercise and this new B verse.
3. Find one more melodic line from earlier in the book, or compose a
brand new one, and call it C. Write an arch form composition with
your A, B, and C verses (ABCBA).
4. Write a short, 8-bar blues song following the chord progression chart
above. Now, expand that 8 bars into 12 bars.
How about 16? Give it a title and see if you can come up with some lyrics. 
5. Make something atonal.
See if you can write atonal variations of well-known melodies such as
“Old McDonald,” “Yankee Doodle,” or “Silent Night.”
6. Use chords atonally.
Develop Exercise 1 by adding chords.
7. Get random.
Try writing random notes based on a rhythmic pattern. Use accidentals.
8. Use imagery.
Write random notes based on a landscape or city skyline. Use accidentals.
9. Be comprehensive.
Write a melody using all twelve semitones without repeating any tones.
10. Branch out.
Write a different melody with the notes in the same series that you used
in exercise 9.

ouldn’t it be nice to have an entire live ensemble on hand, at all times,
to play their bits in your compositions as you write them? Well, most
likely that’s not going to happen. Most, if not all, of the times when inspira-
tion hits, you’re going to be all alone, and you’re just going to have to figure
out on your own what parts of your composition the violins should play, or
the horns, or whether you should limit your composition to only one or two
instruments. 
Musicians that work with synthesizers and MIDI as their primary composi-
tion tools can easily fall into the trap of believing that what they’re playing on
the keyboard in front of them is easily replicable on live instruments, or with
a live singer’s vocals. You need to take a lot into account when writing for
multiple live instruments and their players — such as allotting time for horn
players to take a breath between phrases, the hand-span of a bass or guitar
player, the range of a singer’s voice — and if you don’t take these factors into
account, you’re going to end up with a very frustrated group of musicians.
Concert Pitch and Transposition
There is a reason why the piano is such a well-loved composition tool. Not
only do the 88 keys of the piano contain virtually all the notes you will ever
need to create a solid foundation for a full orchestral piece, but the entire
piano is tuned to what is called concert pitch. Concert pitch simply means
that when you hit a C note on the piano, you are actually playing a C. If you

were to hold a guitar tuner up next to the piano while you hit the key, the
tuner would read C. The end. According to current standards, middle C (C4)
on the piano is a tone that vibrates at 261.63 Hz. A4, the A above middle C, is
pegged at 440 Hz.
However, if you were to play a C on what is called a transposing instrument,
you would get another note entirely, and this is where it can get confusing.
For example, if you were playing a B flat clarinet, and the note on sheet music
was notated C, you would actually be playing a B flat. If you were to play a
written C on an E flat alto sax, you would actually be playing an E flat.
The easy answer for why transposing instruments are the way they are has as
much to do with the convenience of musicians as historical tradition. Most
instruments are too small to contain the 88 notes of a piano, so most instru-
ments you’ll deal with as a composer have only a fraction of the piano’s 
tones available for use. Brass and woodwind instruments are built so that by
depressing or releasing sequential valves, the musician either moves up or
down to the next note of the scale. This scale is read as the C scale when the
musician is playing alone, even if the instrument is actually tuned to the B flat
or E flat or any other scale. 
All instruments in both woodwind and brass families are designed this way,
and because of this, a clarinetist can theoretically pick up a saxophone for
the first time and, if he can blow strong enough to make the transition work,
can soon play a song he or she is familiar with on the clarinet. This same
musician can pick up an oboe or a flugelhorn or any other brass or woodwind
instrument and make just as easy a transition. Depending on the instrument,
there may be one or two extra or fewer buttons on the instrument’s body, but
the main notes — A, B, C, D, E, F, and G — will be there. 
Back in the day, instrument designers had two choices: Either create a series
of similarly shaped and sounding instruments tuned to the same key but with
different fingerings, or create the same series of instruments with different
tunings but with the same arrangement of fingerings. When you consider the
basic physics of the matter, you can see that there is no way for a clarinet to
have the same valve pattern of an oboe and sound the same, simply because
one is much smaller than the other and therefore, the smaller one naturally
has a higher pitch than the other. It’s the difference between the high-pitched
squeal that comes from air being forced through a tiny hose and the deeper-
pitched squeal that comes through a bigger hose. 
When a soloist on one of these instruments performs alone, there aren’t a lot
of pitch conflicts to worry about. However, when you get two or more different
types of horns in the same room together, the differences in the instruments’
set tunings become very obvious. In order to play together, each musician has
to transpose, or move to a different key, up or down the necessary steps so that
all of the instruments in the room are playing the same C.
164
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

In the old days, back when staff paper and especially sheet music was expen-
sive, the members of an ensemble would all work off of the same piece of
sheet music, and the individual musicians had to make the necessary trans-
positions in his or her head. These days, however, most sheet music for
ensembles is individually tailored to match the parts each musician is to play.
The burden of transposition is now carried solely by the composer/arranger,
who writes out individual pieces for each musician/instrument in the corre-
sponding pitch and key. 
Pitch Ranges of Transposing Instruments
In this section we discuss some of the more commonly used transposing
instruments and how we can use them in our compositions. There are many,
many more obscure and personalized instruments out there that fit into this
transposing category as well, but we’re just going to stick to the instruments
you’re most likely to work with.
Many modern electronic keyboards take into consideration a natural instru-
ment’s range. As we mentioned, not all instruments can play all the notes
available on your standard 88-note keyboard, or even your smaller 54-note
keyboard. This wasn’t taken into consideration in some of the earlier sam-
plers and MIDI keyboards, and therefore, the synth composer was presented
with the concept of having a piccolo sounding four octaves lower than possi-
ble, or timpani percussion sounding seven octaves higher than available to
the actual instrument. Possibilities like that are exciting if you’re planning on
only composing for synthesizers, but if you’re going to be using the actual
instruments at any point, you have to be familiar with the physical range of
the instrument.
In addition, you have to keep in mind the physical capabilities of the perform-
ers you’re working with. “Fats” Waller may have been able to pound out a
chord spanning an octave-and-a-half on a regular basis, but most pianists
would have to use two hands to do what he could easily do with one.
Maynard Ferguson may have been able to blast out those upper register
notes and make it sound easy, but your average trumpet player would 
probably split his or her upper lip trying to replicate his technique. 
Transposing instruments are the ones you’re going to have to think out the
parts for the most when writing music, so let’s get ‘em out of the way. But
first, a word about our notation. The first C found on the very farthest left of
the keyboard is called C1, while the middle C—found three octaves higher —
is called C4. That means it’s the fourth C as you go up the keyboard. The G
below middle C is called G3. The highest note on the keyboard is B8. We use
this notation, along with illustrations, to discuss the pitch ranges of instru-
ments in this chapter.
165
Chapter 14: Composing for the Standard Orchestra

Alto flute
This is the only flute that is a transposing instrument. Although every other
flute is tuned to concert pitch, or the key of C, the alto flute is tuned to a G nat-
ural. This means that in order to write music for the alto flute, you need to
transpose the music up a fourth from concert pitch. To hear a concert C, for
example, your flutist would have to see an F on his or her sheet music.
The reason people pick up an alto flute to begin with is partly because the
somewhat quieter instrument can play much lower notes than the concert
flute, and partly because its very cool shape is irresistible to instrument con-
noisseurs — alto flutes (and bass flutes) are the ones that look like the end
was bent in half by Superman.
Flute tones are sweet in character and blend well with other instruments. The
flute’s timbre (the distinct quality of its sound), pitch, and attack (how quickly
an instrument sounds after playing a key, string, or what have you) are flexi-
ble, allowing a very high degree of instantaneous expressive control. This
also makes the flute a great lead “singer” in an ensemble, as it’s able to follow
the lead lines you write quickly and distinctively.
The range of the alto flute is C4 (the G below middle C) through C7.

B flat trumpet
When you’re writing parts for a B flat trumpet, you have to transpose the
music a whole step up from concert. So if the composer wants the trumpet to
166
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

sound a true C in concert pitch, he has to write the part out on the trumpet
player’s sheet music as D. This is true for all B flat transposing instruments.
Just remember to write one whole tone higher than you want to hear. But for
easy reference, have a look at the following table:

The practical, comfortable range for most B flat trumpet players to perform
within is between the B flat below middle C and the D two octaves above
middle C, as seen in Figure 14-1.
As you can see in Figure 14-1, there are certainly other notes that are available
for the B flat trumpet player to use both above and below the most effective
range, but unless you’re very familiar with the capabilities of the performers
you’re going to use to play your compositions, for the majority of trumpet
players out there it’s best to try to stick within the effective range. The writ-
ten range for B flat trumpet is F#3 to E6.

The B flat trumpet is a loud and high-sounding instrument, best for punching
out quick melody lines, which makes it a favorite for lead instrument in an
ensemble. It is the “brassiest” of the brass instruments.
B flat clarinet
The clarinet is perhaps one of the most misunderstood and misused instru-
ments in the orchestra. Way too many people start off on the clarinet in the
high school orchestra, only to ditch it as quickly as possible simply because
they have no idea of the potential of the instrument. Although many other
musical cultures have embraced the clarinet as the focal point of their
ensemble — especially klezmer and Bulgarian folk music — most of us in the
Western hemisphere think of Benny Goodman and Lawrence Welk when we
think of the clarinet. Just pick up any Naftule Brandwein or, in a more recent
context, Sex Mob or John Zorn record, and you’ll hear how amazing this
instrument can sound. 
The clarinet is an extremely versatile instrument. It’s got a great range, is
built for speed, and is incredibly expressive. It has almost exactly the same
musical range as a guitar (Figure 14-2), so it’s very easy to play leads written
for guitars on the clarinet, and vice versa. 
The B flat clarinet is, of course, a transposing instrument tuned to B flat. To
write music for it, you need to transpose the sheet music up a whole step
from concert pitch. The written range for B flat clarinet is E3 to A6.

E flat clarinet
Sometimes called the “baby clarinet,” the E flat clarinet is the highest-pitched
of the clarinet family. It’s the only clarinet tuned to an E flat instead of a B flat.
To write music for the E flat clarinet, you have to first transpose the music a
diatonic sixth (six scale degrees) up and then down an octave — or down a
minor third. Its written range is E3 to E6 (Figure 14-4).

English horn/cor anglais
The English horn, or cor anglais, is a close cousin to the oboe but is one third
longer. Like the oboe, it’s a double reed instrument, and because it’s longer,
its range extends a full fifth deeper than the oboe’s. Its slightly flared bell
makes for a more nasally timbre than the oboe, creating a sound that’s a little
like four parts oboe, one part trumpet.

The English horn is a transposing instrument built in the key of F. In order to
write music for it, you need to transpose your music up a diatonic fifth (five

Flugelhorn
You ever see a fox hunt on the big screen or on TV? Perhaps you’ve partici-
pated in a real live fox hunt yourself — in either case, you’ve heard the plain-
tive call of the flugelhorn in action. The flugelhorn is built a lot like a cornet,
but because the bell is a deeper funnel, the sound coming out of the flugel-
horn is much richer and lower in pitch than its slightly tinny cousin. The
flugelhorn is mellower and lower than the trumpet, kind of like a viola com-
pared to a violin. 
The flugelhorn is another B flat transposing instrument, with its easy-to-play
range of F#3 to E6 (Figure 14-6). Again, a composer would need to transpose
the musical sections written for the flugelhorn up a whole step from concert.

French horn
French horns are just plain beautiful to look at, and just about everyone who
writes for a horn section in a composition wants to use a French horn at
sometime or another, probably because the visual idea of throwing one of
those pretty instruments — which has more twists and turns than a bucket 
of brass spaghetti — into live arrangement is too tempting to resist. 
Another nice thing about the French horn is, thanks to all those twists and
turns in the piping, its ability to smoothly play music through over three
octaves, whereas most brass instruments have not much more than a two-
octave range.
However, although it’s possible to play lots more notes on the French horn
than on other horns, it’s not an instrument built for speed. When writing
music for the French horn, try not to use a lot of fancy ornamentation or
quick parts for the player.

On the good side, the French horn is such a beautiful, pure-sounding instru-
ment that there is nothing it doesn’t blend well with. The French horn can
just as easily fit in with a woodwind section as it can a brass section. The
French horn is a transposing instrument set in the key of F, which means that
to write music for the French horn, you have to transpose the music up a per-
fect fifth from concert pitch (Figure 14-7).
On paper, this is fabulously easy. Just remember that perfect fifths are located
exactly two lines or two spaces on the staff above (or below) the originating
note. If you’re writing music for the French horn on a different instrument,
such as the piano, just remember that perfect fifths are separated by seven
half steps (black and white keys), or three whole steps and one half step.

Piccolo trumpet
The piccolo trumpet is smaller and capable of higher, brighter-sounding notes
than the B flat trumpet. Thus it is used for more sprightly sounding musical
sections. It’s also (normally) a B flat transposing instrument, with the 
notes sounding a full octave higher than the B flat trumpet.
When writing music for the piccolo trumpet, you have two things to take into
consideration: First, transpose the sheet music for the instrument a whole
step up from concert. Second, the music is going to be played a full octave
higher than middle C.
The written range for the piccolo trumpet is F#3 to C6 (Figure 14-9).

Non-Transposing Instruments
With non-transposing instruments, what you write down on paper is the note
you’re going to hear. Hurray! The only thing you have to take into considera-
tion, then, is the actual range of the instrument you’re writing for — that, and
the physical capabilities of the performers on the instruments.
Concert flute
Usually reserved for solos because it is one of the quieter instruments of the
orchestra, the concert flute is a high-pitched instrument with a beautiful, fem-
inine tone that is instantly distinguishable from any other instrument. The
instrument is easy for most flutists (or flautists) to play, which makes it a
favorite with beginning band students who want to find an instrument with
which they can quickly master the basics.
The flute’s written range is C4 to C7 (Figure 14-10).

Bass flute
The bass flute looks almost exactly like a concert flute, except that the barrel
is a little wider — just wide enough to drop the actual notes played a full
octave lower. When composers write for the bass flute, they often write on
the treble clef, a full octave higher that what will be played (Figure 14-11). 
Bassoon
You can just tell from the name of the instrument that the bassoon isn’t some
high-pitched squeaky thing. Nope, the bassoon is the beautiful fog horn of the
orchestra pit. 
Bassoons are notoriously tricky to play, so be kind and gentle when arranging
music for your bassoonists. A great deal of wind has to be forced through the
tiny metal tube that makes up the mouthpiece of the instrument, and playing
the bassoon is akin to trying to blow up a great big beach ball via the tiny
rubber valve. 
The written range for the bassoon is B%1 to E%5 (Figure 14-12).
Double bass/contrabass
The double bass, or contrabass, is the deepest-sounding bowed instrument
of the orchestra. It may look like it belongs to the violin family of instruments
(violin, viola, and cello), but it is actually considered to be the only surviving

member of the viola de gamba family of instruments. Where members of the
violin family have their strings tuned a fifth apart from one another, each
string of the double bass is tuned to a fourth apart from the next.
The shape of the instrument itself is different than the violin/viola/cello — its
“shoulders” are pinched in, rather than rounded out, and its body is longer
and narrower overall than the other three instruments. As with the bass guitar
in rock music, the double bass is the fulcrum of the orchestra, and the basic
purpose of the contrabass is to hold down the bottom end of the composition.
The range of the double bass is E2 to G5 (Figure 14-13).
Oboe
The double reed oboe family is considered to be the oldest family of wood-
wind instruments. Double reed instruments that looked a lot like the modern
oboe were in use in Greece nearly 3,000 years ago, brought over by Egyptians
who had used double reed instruments as much as a thousand years earlier
than that. The direct ancestor of the oboe is credited as the shawm, which
was probably introduced into Europe during the Crusades when the Saracen
armies invaded and used this instrument in war as well as for dancing. The
bore of the shawm is conical and wide, as is the double reed. The body is
constructed from a single piece of wood with finger holes. 
The oboe is considered a very special instrument by many composers, who
relish its deep, rich, distinctive musical flavor and the way it mixes in with
the rest of the woodwinds of the orchestra. The entire orchestra tunes to the
A of the oboe, possibly because there isn’t any practical way to tune an oboe. 
Modern oboes are still made from African blackwood (grenadilla) and are
made in three parts. Oboes are still handmade by expert craftsmen who are
very secretive about the dimensions and the size of the apertures used in the
construction. The double reed is made especially for oboes from cane which
is grown on the east coast of Spain or the south of France and dried and aged
for several years before being shipped to your local music store. There are, of
course, synthetic reeds made for oboes today that most likely work just as
well and are much cheaper, but many perfectionists still swear by the hand-
made ones from Europe.

Chapter 14: Composing for the Standard Orchestra

The written range for the oboe is B%3 to A6 (Figure 14-14).
Orchestral harp
People have played some version of the harp for thousands of years. The pre-
Hellenic (neolithic) Greeks left dozens of little marble kouros figures playing
harps behind for future archeologists to mull over, while Egyptian artists
painted florid murals depicting harpists playing in the royal court. 
The notes of the harp range from C1 to G7, with each single string being a
separate note. The harp is tuned to the scale of C, with each F string colored
either black or blue and each C string colored either red or orange to ease
navigation of the instrument.
The written range of the harp is C%1 to G#7 (Figure 14-15).
Tenor slide trombone
The tenor slide trombone is another cool-looking instrument. It’s the one with
the long bar attached to the side of it that allows the performer to move fluidly
from one note to another (or jerkily, depending on the piece or performer). The
trombone is more powerful and brassy-sounding than the French horn, but 
its tone isn’t as rich.
Because of its slide, it’s possible for a trombonist to play both the whole and
half steps possible on a piano, as well as the spectrum of tones in between
those notes. However, most trombonists stay away from these microtones for
the simple fact that most composers write their music on a standard staff,
which doesn’t allow for microtones.

The tenor trombone’s range is E2 to F5 (Figure 14-16).
Viola
The viola was a favorite instrument of Johann Sebastian Bach, who appreci-
ated the fact that its range extended lower than the violin’s but higher than
the cello’s. All three instruments look almost exactly the same, with the main
difference being, of course, size. The viola is placed on the shoulder and played
with a bow, as is the violin. It is sometimes referred to as the big fiddle.
Prior to the 18th century, the viola was the most prominent member of the
stringed instrument family. But it was supplanted by the violin when audi-
ences began showing a preference to the brighter sound of the higher-pitched
instrument.
The top string of the viola can sound a little squawky and nasally, so most
composers try to stick to writing only for the lower registers when compos-
ing music for violas.
The range of the viola is C3 to A6 (Figure 14-17).
Violin
This is an instrument that needs no introduction. Due to its incredibly sweet
tones and capabilities for speed and expressiveness, this stringed instrument
is almost always a lead instrument in the orchestra. Violins sound wonderful
whether being used for solos or performing en masse.

Chapter 14: Composing for the Standard Orchestra

The violin’s range is G3 to B7 (Figure 14-18).
Cello
The cello, also called the violincello, is the biggest and lowest-sounding
member of the violin family. It’s much too big and heavy to rest on the shoul-
der, so it’s held between the performer’s knees instead. (You never see a
homeless person with a cello — which could mean either that cellists are
some of the best-paid musicians out there, or that it’s just not worth lugging
the thing out into the rain for a few bucks a day.)
The cello can cover the entire range of the human voice, and consequently, a
lot of “speaking” solo parts are written for it, in which the cello seems to be
delivering the lyrical part of a song instead of an actual singer. As the bass
voice in the string quartet, the cello is a grounding force in what might other-
wise be a tinny and high-pitched ensemble.
The cello’s range is C2 to E6 (Figure 14-19).

Getting the Sounds You Want
Getting the sound you want goes beyond choosing the right notes and instru-
ments. As we have said in other places throughout this book, each instru-
ment has a unique range of tonal colors and dynamic expressions available to
it. Playing an instrument through a mouthpiece provides distinctly different
possibilities and limitations, for example, than playing an instrument with a
pick or a bow. Even though some symbols, such as dynamic markings and the
notes themselves, are common to all instruments, each family of instruments
also has its own additional symbolic language for expression.
Here we present some of these symbols and their explanations for the string
instruments and the brass and woodwind instruments. Much more informa-
tion can be acquired through the study of instrumental arranging. We won’t
go too deeply into this area for lack of space, but composition and arranging
overlap each other so much that the line between them is blurry — when it
can be seen at all. The melody you hear in your head played by the French
horn probably already has a dynamic shape and a tonal quality before it ever
gets written down. At any rate, the more specifically you can indicate what it
is that you want to hear from the instruments, the more effectively you will
be able to communicate your music to your audiences.

Stringed instruments
Because the bow (or pick, in the case of the guitar) is such an important com-
ponent of playing a string instrument, and because there are so many varia-
tions of expression produced by different bowing techniques, a set of
symbols instructing the player as to which bowing techniques to use has
been developed.
For example, a down-bow (pulling the bow down) can produce a more aggres-
sive expression than an up-bow (when you push the bow up). This holds true
for down and up picking on a guitar as well, and the guitar symbols are bor-
rowed from the string symbols. Notice in Figure 14-21 that the down-bow looks
like a picture of the heel end of the bow and the up-bow looks like the tip.

Tips on transposing
Here are a few shortcuts to help you remember
how to do the most common transpositions:
E flat instruments: Find the relative minor, make
it major, then write in that key. This means that
if you were writing a piece of music in the key
of C, and you wanted to write a part for an E flat
instrument, you would first find the relative
minor of C major (A minor), then notate the
music for the instrument in A major — that is,
with three sharps in the key signature. All the
notes in the music are then moved up a fourth,
or three spaces and lines, from their original
positions. Some E flat instruments include the
contra-alto clarinet, the alto clarinet, the E flat
clarinet, the alto saxophone, the baritone saxo-
phone, the tenor horn, and the E flat tuba. 
F instruments: Just add one sharp or subtract a
flat from the key signature, and write the music
in the resulting key. All notation is moved up one
perfect fifth from where originally written. Some
F instruments include the English horn, the
basset horn, and the F alto saxophone. 
B flat instruments: Move everything up one
whole tone. Some B flat instruments include the
B flat clarinet (soprano and bass), the soprano
and tenor saxophone, the trumpet, the cornet,
the flugelhorn, the euphonium, and the tenor
trombone.

Any guitar player knows that playing several down picks in a row sounds dif-
ferent than picking up and down alternately (Figure 14-22).
The same thing holds true for a violin, but with a violin or other members of
its family, a single stroke of the bow can produce a whole series of notes. This
would be indicated by a slur (Figure 14-23).
In Figure 14-24, all four notes in the first half of the first measure are played
with a single up-bow, the next two notes are down, the next two are up, and it
ends on the downbeat of the following measure with a strong down-bow.

The slur indicates a legato style of connecting the notes. You could play the
same first series of four notes on a single bow stroke, but separate them
slightly. This is called louré (Figure 14-25).
Spiccato is a fast, light staccato produced by bouncing the bow on the string
(Figure 14-26).
Bouncing a group of notes on a single up- or down-bow is called jetè 
(Figure 14-27).

an indication to pluck the strings; Arco means to bow normally.

Remember that without some kind of indication of how you want a part to be
played, you will probably spend a lot of time (and possibly a lot of money)
figuring it out with the musicians. And nothing can shake your confidence
more than the feeling that you don’t have the right language to communicate
your ideas to the musicians.

Chapter 15
Composing for the Nonstandard
Orchestra
In This Chapter
 Getting to the bottom of basses
 Strumming along with guitars
 Squeezing out information on free reed instruments
U
nless you’ve got great philharmonic connections, there’s a really good
chance that you won’t be writing music for oboes and gigantic golden
harps anytime soon. Even if you do have great philharmonic connections,
you may still be more interested in writing pop music, or even jazz. The
slower seeming, more somber-sounding instruments in an orchestra won’t
make many appearances in your music.
In that case, the instruments for which you’ll want to know the ranges and
qualities are the ones in the “nonstandard orchestra.” This group includes
basses (upright, acoustic, and electric), guitars (acoustic and electric), and
the free reed family (accordions, concertinas, and harmonicas).
To your advantage as a composer, though, all of the following instruments
used in the nonstandard orchestra are incredibly “quick” and expressive. A
good solo line on a guitar can carry as much weight as a violin, while a bass
guitar works as well as a bottom to your music as an upright bass or an oboe,
but also has the ability to deliver complicated, quick musical lines that nei-
ther classical instrument can carry. Plus, all of the following instruments,
with the exception of the harmonica and the concertina, have a huge range,
so that you can play just about any piece of music written for the orchestra
on just a couple of guitars and basses. 
Therefore, when composing music for any of the instruments discussed in
this chapter, you don’t have to take nearly as much into consideration as 
you do with instruments in the standard orchestra. You don’t have to worry
about whether the line of music you’re writing is too “quick” for a bass,

guitar, or keyboard to pull off, because these instruments are all very fast and
expressive. Range is another factor that fades into the background, as most
of these instruments have as wide a range as anything else in the standard
orchestra. The only thing you have to really think about is the sound of the
instrument itself.
(Of course, many more instruments other than the ones we focus on in this
chapter are to be found in popular ensembles, and most of them are covered
in Chapter 14.)
The Bass
The bass has a very important position in whatever ensemble it is placed in.
In an orchestral setting, the bass — which would include cello, violincello,
and double bass — is generally the lowest-sounding part of the orchestra,
serving as counterweight to the higher-pitched instruments. It fills out a per-
formance that might otherwise sound too high-pitched and tinny by giving a
solid “bottom” to the musical piece.
In a jazz and pop ensemble, the bass serves as the fulcrum, or hinge-like sup-
porting piece, of the band. The bass is just as much in charge of carrying the
pulse or beat of the music as the percussion section is. As the instrument
usually playing the tonic or fifth of whatever chord is happening, it’s also in
charge of carrying the key that the rest of the band is playing in. When it’s
time to make a chord change in a pop composition, often it’s the bass line
where this key change is most apparent. 
Upright bass
In the 1950s, the upright bass — also known as the double bass or contrabass —
became a fixture in early rock and roll and, to this day, rockabilly music. In
the 1960s, folk artists latched on to the idea of having the gigantic instrument
in their ensembles, both for the visual aesthetics of the beautiful classical
instrument as well as the nice, deep sound you could never get from the 
comparatively small body of a regular-sized acoustic or electric bass. 
In pop and jazz music, the instrument’s strings are plucked instead of bowed,
which makes a world of difference in how the instrument sounds. It still has
the same instrument range as noted in Chapter 14, but instead of sounding
deep and sonorous, you get a lively vibrato that shakes you to your toes.
When you play it really fast, such as in rockabilly and bluegrass music, it can
sound a lot like you’re snapping loud, musical rubber bands (especially in the
hands of an amateur). Put an upright bass in the hands of a really capable
188
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

musician, such as, for example, Reid Anderson of The Bad Plus, and you have
a sound that combines both the deep, resonating tones of the classical con-
trabass and the speed and tonal flexibility of a bass guitar.
Electric bass guitar
The modern electric bass guitar is the smaller, handier offshoot of the family
of big orchestral basses. In 1951, inspired by the success of the electric
guitar, Leo Fender built the first commercially available electric bass guitar.
As it was designed to be electronically amplified, there was no longer any
need to have a gigantic hollow body to amplify the sound, which meant that a
guitar-sized solid body could be just as deep and loud as a contrabass.
Further modifications to electronic pickups — coil, passive, active, hybrid,
and humbucker — have led to the possibility of creating tones that range
from the grittiest, dirtiest rock and pop to completely pure, clean notes, all
on one instrument.
Generally, the four strings of the bass (electric, acoustic, and upright) are
tuned E-A-D-G, one octave below the lowest four strings of the 6-stringed
guitar. It has a range of E2 to G5 (the second E on the piano keyboard up to
the fifth G). Five- and six-stringed basses have identical tunings to four-string
basses, but they extend the instrument’s range on the low end with a B string
and/or increase its solo capabilities on the high end with a high C string.
However, because it is a stringed instrument, the possibilities of creating
higher and lower tones by using alternate tunings, à la Richard Thompson 
or Nick Drake, are considerable.
Acoustic bass
The acoustic bass is the mellow cousin of the electric bass, and, being born
in the 1970s, is the youngest member of the bass family. The famous Ernie
Ball — famous to people who buy guitar and bass strings and accessories,
that is — invented it in California after hearing the guitarrón used in mariachi
bands.
Nowhere is the difference between an electric and acoustic instrument as
apparent as it is when you compare the electronic and acoustic basses. The
acoustic bass lacks the driving power necessary for pushing a band along
simply because the lowest notes of the instrument are not loud enough to
adequately thump out the pulse of a song over the other instruments. It also
lacks the wicked snap of the electric bass that characterizes so much funk
and rock music. Even with an electric pickup in place to amplify the sound,
an acoustic bass fails miserably as a punchy pop instrument.
189
Chapter 15: Composing for the Nonstandard Orchestra

What it is really good for, though, is accompanying a lead line of a song. In
this setting, the rich sound of an acoustic bass serves to beautifully bottom
out the high notes in an acoustic ensemble. Paired with an electric guitar, an
amplified acoustic bass helps fill out the tinny-ness of a classic Danelectro or
Rickenbacker. In an acoustic setting, the acoustic bass adds a feeling of
weight and volume to an ensemble.
The Guitar
With almost all instruments in the guitar family — except the ones with alter-
nate, customized tunings — the strings are tuned to E, A, D, G, B, and E (with
the low E tuned to the second E below middle C, and E4 being the E above
middle C on the piano keyboard). 
Guitar-like instruments have existed since ancient times, with one precursor
to the modern design being a two-stringed version used by the Hittites in
Syria around 1500 B.C. The first “real” guitars appeared around the 14th cen-
tury in Spain. They had seven strings instead of six, with the first six tuned in
pairs (each of the three pairs of strings was tuned to the same note) and the
seventh its own note. (There was no standardized tuning in those halcyon
days before rigid guitar theory, so musicians were actually free to tune their
strings any way they wanted to.) 
Over the next three centuries, strings were added, removed, and doubled as
the guitar began to take its modern form. By the end of the 18th century, the
double courses of strings were turned into single strings, and six differently
tuned strings became the standard for the instrument. Guitar makers in the
19th century broadened the body, increased the curve of the waist, thinned
the belly, and changed the internal bracing, while the wooden tuning pegs
were replaced by longer-lasting modern machine heads.
As an instrument of classical music, the guitar came to prominence largely
through the efforts of the Spanish composer Francisco Tarrega and the
Spanish guitar virtuoso Andrés Segovia. 
Using conventional tuning, with the strings tuned to EADGBE, the range of a
guitar is E3 to E6, though the guitar sounds one octave lower than written.
That means the guitarist reads the notes you write, but the sound that comes
out is actually an octave lower.
Because the guitar does have such a wide playable range and is quick enough
to render complicated melodic phrases on, it’s often used as a lead instru-
ment in an ensemble, especially in pop or rock music.

Acoustic guitar
Because an acoustic guitar is not electrically amplified, one of its most impor-
tant features is the wood it was made from. The soundboard of an acoustic
guitar especially needs to be made of high-quality wood to get the best sound
across. 
This isn’t to say that your average cheap plywood guitar is no good, but it’s
not concert quality. Laminated and plywood soundboards give a guitar great
durability and might work just fine as practice instruments or in bar bands,
but they don’t have the natural vibrato or amplification that a fine wood
soundboard gives a guitar. For example, a spruce soundboard gives a guitar a
crisp, high-end sound and a loud bottom end, with the overall sound much
bigger, fuller, and louder than any other type of soundboard. A cedar or red-
wood soundboard gives an acoustic guitar a beautiful ringing tone, and a
mahogany soundboard produces a sweet, thick, mellow sound. Koa-based
soundboards have a really strong mid-range, with thick, warm-sounding high
and low tones. 
Of course, once you stick an electric pickup on an acoustic or a microphone
in front of it, its natural sound will be altered according to the quality of the
amplifying device. Look for pickups and microphones that amplify the acoustic
with the least amount of interference.
Electric guitar
Although there were certainly inventive bluesmen who experimented with
electrifying their git-boxes — such as Blind Willie Johnson and One String
Sam — Adolph Rickenbacker is credited with inventing the first solid-body
electric guitar in the 1930s. Les Paul tinkered with the design in the 1940s,
and the electric guitar we know and love today was born. 
The electric guitar was initially built for volume, so that it could both be heard
over other instruments and crowds of noisy people. As the body of an elec-
tric guitar is completely solid and usually made of resin, there’s no empty
wood chamber for the sound of the strings to be amplified in. Therefore,
when it is unplugged, the best sound you’re going to get from it is about as
noisy as a beehive. Plug that sucker in, though, and you’ve got an instrument
that plays even faster and easier than an acoustic, due to the lower action
(closer proximity of the strings to the guitar neck).
A large variety of types of music can be played on guitar, due to pickups and
amplifiers that can either distort the guitar’s natural sound to the crackly
hiss of a surf guitar or reproduce it so clearly that it sounds like an amplified
acoustic — all from the same guitar.

Chapter 15: Composing for the Nonstandard Orchestra

Twelve-string guitar
A twelve-string guitar is much like a six-string guitar with one obvious 
exception — it has twelve strings instead of six. When you’re tuning a 
twelve-stringed guitar, the best way to do so is to think of it as having six
pairs of strings, instead of twelve individual strings.
The first (highest) two strings are unisons, tuned to an E; the second set are
also unisons, tuned to the same B. The third pair of strings, G, are either
unisons or an octave apart, depending on preference. For the three bass
courses, D, A, and E, each pair is tuned an octave apart.
The effect of this tuning gives the twelve-string guitar a nice, full, bright-
sounding ring, while the doubled treble strings sound fuller and richer than
on a six-string. This is because the unisons are not exactly unisons, and the
octaves not precisely octaves, which gives the instrument a natural chorus
effect — the fuller sound coming from the slight interference between similar
but not exactly identical tones.
Steel guitar
Plenty of guitars have lots of shiny metal on them, either for structural rein-
forcement, amplification, or decoration, but the real qualifier of what makes a
steel guitar a steel guitar is that steel guitars are played by sliding a metal bar
along the neck while picking. The effect of this is that the notes sound like
they’re being bent from one pitch to the next, very smoothly and twangy, like
the stuff Hawaiian crooner Don Ho was famous for. 
There are many types of steel guitars, but the most popular ones are the lap
steel (or Hawaiian) guitar, the Dobro, and the pedal steel.
The lap steel is held on your lap — just like the name implies — with one
hand moving the steel, a kind of sliding mechanism, up and down the neck,
and the other hand plucking out the tune, either with a pick or with fingers.
A Dobro looks a lot like a regular guitar, except that the neck is much thicker
and stronger, and a much thicker gauge of string is used on the guitar to fur-
ther amplify this already fairly loud instrument.
A pedal steel guitar is set on a stand and looks like one or two guitar necks,
minus the body, mounted on a box. Pedal steels also can have as many as ten
strings per neck. 
192
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Steel guitars are not tuned like conventional guitars, either, and each kind of
steel guitar has its own specific tuning, which can also vary from performer
to performer. Chords are formed with a solid steel slide instead of your hand,
so steel guitars are usually tuned to an open chord, so that only bar chords
have to be formed, such as an open G (D, G, D, G, D, lowest string to highest),
an open A (E, C#, E, A, C#, E), a high G (G, B, D, G, B, D), a high A (A, C#, E, A,
C#, E), a C6 (C, E, G, E, C, A), and so on.
Mucking around with higher tunings like those can really screw up the neck
of a regular guitar (and snap a few strings), hence the additional reinforce-
ment of the neck and the higher gauge of guitar string used on steel guitars.
Free Reed Instruments
The free reed family consists of accordions, concertinas, and harmonicas.
According to Chinese legend, the first known free reed instrument, the cheng,
was created around 3000 B.C. when a scholar named Ling Lun disappeared
into the mountains of China in search of the phoenix. When he returned, he
had not captured the phoenix itself, but had captured its song for mankind. 
The cheng, which is still in very limited use today in traditional Chinese
ensembles, is shaped to resemble the phoenix and has between 13 and 24
bamboo pipes, a small gourd which acts as a resonator box and wind cham-
ber, and a mouthpiece. It’s the first instrument known to demonstrate the
free reed principle, which basically means that wind moves over a set of
reeds in either direction to create a specific pitch.
Free reed instruments are different from woodwind and certain brass instru-
ments, which also have reeds and use pressurized air to produce noise but
only produce a pure sound when the air is blown through the mouthpiece.
You don’t suck in through a clarinet’s mouthpiece to play music, but you can
suck air through a harmonica or accordion bellows to produce notes that
sound just as good as when you blow the air out. (Over the centuries, the
cheng evolved into the small, box-like sheng, or Chinese mouth organ, which
was the direct inspiration for the European mouth organ, or harmonica.)
The harmonica
There are two types of harmonicas, one which belongs in the family of free
reed instruments, and one that doesn’t. The one that doesn’t is the one that
first bore the name harmonica. None other than Benjamin Franklin invented
the glass harmonica, which was a much more complicated version of the
193
Chapter 15: Composing for the Nonstandard Orchestra

graduated glass bowls and champagne glasses that one would rub a wet
finger along the rim of to produce a clear, ringing tone. Franklin’s harmonica
was a series of shallow glass basins of different sizes fixed onto a spindle that
would continuously rotate. To produce music, one would simply wet one’s
finger and touch the basin that matched the pitch you wanted to hear.
The harmonica that we all know and love today is not this bulky and possibly
dangerous instrument. The free reed harmonica was originally invented in
Germany and England almost simultaneously in the 1820s. Successively
higher tones of the scale are produced by alternately blowing or sucking air
through the mouthpiece. 
A harmonica’s range is limited according to its size (from little tiny 6-note
instruments to orchestral harmonicas, which can be made to the musician’s
specification), simply because the instrument is very small. Generally, though,
most harmonicas are designed to play 19 consecutive scale notes, with each
kind of harmonica tuned to a specific scale.
The accordion
The first version of the accordion was an 1820 model called the Handäoline,
invented in Germany. Nine years later, the first real accordion, with ten
melody buttons and two bass buttons, was patented by Cyril Demian in
Vienna. Later versions added more buttons, enabling players to produce a
wider range of notes and chords. The piano accordion, called so because it
has a piano keyboard along one side, and a series of buttons on the other,
was developed in the 1850s. 
The piano accordion is almost universally acknowledged to have one of the
best education systems on any instrument. The stradella bass system (the but-
tons), when combined with the piano keyboard, requires players to develop a
knowledge of both the chromatic sequence of pitch as on the piano keyboard
and also the chord relationships and chord types as arranged in fifths on the
buttons. This makes it unique among all musical instruments, having both
single notes and preformed chords available at one time.
The instrument is played, of course, by drawing (stretching) and pushing
(compressing) the bellows, causing air to pass over the metal reeds. This 
airflow makes the reeds vibrate, which produces different pitches.
The concertina
The concertina was officially developed in 1830 by Sir Charles Wheatstone
after several years of building prototypes, a few of which still exist, such as
the symphonium. Its fully chromatic range was suited to, and for a while
194
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

extremely popular for, classical pieces, with its fast action lending it nicely to
“party pieces” such as “The Flight of the Bumble Bee.” Nowadays there are
two main kinds of concertina: the English and the Anglo.
A typical English concertina has 48 buttons, with each button assigned the
same pitch no matter which direction the bellows are moved. The English
concertina is preferred for pieces with vocal accompaniment.
The anglo concertina comes mainly in 20-button and 30-button varieties, and
like the harmonica each button can produce two notes, depending on
whether the air is blowing or sucking. The 20-button anglo is more or less
confined to playing in two keys only, typically C and G. The 30-button model
adds incidentals, enabling the player to venture into other keys, such as D
and F. The anglo is popular in folk music, especially Irish traditional music.
Accordion and concertina ranges depend on both the size of the instrument,
the key it’s set in, and how many buttons are present. A full piano accordion,
such as a classical Wurlitzer, has a range of around six octaves.

t’s not always enough to just write a good melody and have some chords
playing behind it as accompaniment. Sometimes you can create more
interest in a piece of music by having more than one sound moving in a
melodic fashion at one time.
What we mean by this is that along with that flute melody and the harp arpeg-
gios behind it, you may feel inclined to add a melodic accompaniment from
some other instrument. Maybe it’s another flute, or it could be a vocal, a clar-
inet, or whatever works for you. This idea of multiple melodic voices opens
up a lot of creative territory and presents new challenges of its own.
Story Lines and Instrumentation 
One of the creative territories that you open up when considering more than
one melodic voice in your composition is the ability to use instrumental
choices as characterizations in your music. In his well-known orchestral com-
position, Peter and the Wolf, Sergei Prokofiev uses instruments to directly rep-
resent specific characters in his story. For example, the duck is an oboe, the
bird is a flute, the cat is a clarinet, and the wolf is three ominous-sounding
French horns.
This use of specific instruments playing certain motifs to indicate certain ideas
and characters is fairly common. Another example of specific characteriza-
tions (sometimes called leitmotifs) is to be found in the song “Tubby the

Tuba” by Paul Tripp and George Keinsinger. In this composition, several
instruments take on personalities as the Tuba seeks something more 
melodically expressive than the usual oom-pah, oom-pah.
You don’t have to be as direct and literal as Prokofiev or Tripp-Keisinger with
your characterizations, but you can definitely choose specific instruments to
convey moods, have dialogs, create contrast, and generally tell an emotional
story. The story doesn’t need to have specific characters attached to definite
instruments.
When writing for multiple voices, whether you are telling a specific story or
being totally abstract, you are always establishing and developing relation-
ships within your music. Just as in a conversation, multiple melodic voices 
in a musical composition can represent different forces in your music. For
example, you could assign each of the following things to different instru-
ments:
 Agreement
 Discourse
 Argument
 Playfulness
 Conflict
 Confusion
 Chaos
A storyline can form in the imagination of each listener. You don’t have to
provide anything but the music.
Writing Multiple Harmony Lines 
One way to get two or more voices to work together is to keep them harmoni-
cally and rhythmically aligned. This technique is called parallel harmony, but
that term can be deceptive. There are times when voices harmonized in par-
allel do not exactly move together in perfectly synchronized motion. The
idea, rather, is to stay within the tonality of the piece and observe the same
rhythmic phrasing without the parts running across each other, away from
each other, or towards each other.
Notice how the last three notes in the second part of Figure 16-1 don’t move
parallel to the first part. If they did, we would lose the tonal relationship
between the two parts.
198
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Another idea might be for one voice to move and the other to stay a little
more stationary. This is known as block harmony. In Figure 16-2, we are still
using the same rhythmic phrases for both voices. (We will break free from
this later.)
You could also choose to harmonize the second voice by moving it obliquely,
or in a contrary direction (Figure 16-3).

Chapter 16: Composing for Multiple Voices

Ideas such as these can work well if your intention is to convey rhythmic and
tonal interdependence between the two voices. In these examples, the voices
are basically married by the rhythmic phrases they share. Even when they
move in opposite directions they still feel closely connected.
When writing parts like this, the tonal blend of the instruments you choose is
critical. If the instruments have too strong of an independent tonal quality,
their combination can spoil the marriage presented by the musical composi-
tion, unless they play in unison, in octaves, or in larger instrumental sections.
Independent Voices
Sometimes the feeling you want to convey in your music is one of two tonally
related, but rhythmically independent melodic ideas. In a case like that you
might be weaving two entirely different melodies together — or the same
melody at different times. You can use instruments with contrasting tonalities
or ones that blend well for this sort of thing.
One way to create this sense of independence is to have both voices play
variations of the same melody, but stagger the starting points. This creates
an interlaced, tapestry-like effect, as seen in Figure 16-4.
One of the challenges of this “staggered” type of approach is the danger of
becoming too hopeful that your entire melody will hold up to harmonic
scrutiny when it overlaps itself. You may find that there are some disso-
nances to be resolved by altering a few notes in one or the other melody 
line from time to time.

By the way, the example in Figure 16-6 has a few tonality “don’ts,” which we
get into later in this chapter.
The example shown in Figure 16-5 is based on this idea of overlapping
melodies, but voice 2 has been rewritten to retain the same feel and shape 
as voice 1, without committing so many harmonic and compositional blun-
ders. You will notice, if you play this piece, that the harmonic choices have 
a few different, unexpected turns in them. Some accidents are fortuitous.
The idea is to not settle for poor harmonic choices just because they are
easy. A fancy, dissonant moment can be a charming curiosity that you want
to defend because it is a little different. But don’t be afraid of applying a little
thought to these moments before you decide on keeping them. 
You could also use the same or similar melody for the second voice, but
change it rhythmically. Maybe slow it down and stretch it across more mea-
sures than the first voice’s melody. All of the tools and techniques found in
the chapters on melodic composition are available to you to use on any or all
of your multiple melodic voices. You just have to be aware of the harmonic
and rhythmic relationships that exist between parts.
If you can figure out what your structural underlying harmony and melody
are, you should be able to resolve the moments where your melodies uncom-
fortably collide. Learn to apply enough elbow grease to turn unwanted chaos
and dissonance into something that makes sense. You may have to think
about it a bit and try a few ideas out — but hey, that’s music composition.
On the other hand, sometimes the accidental surprises generated by overlap-
ping melody lines provide unique opportunities for harmonic development.
Dissonance isn’t always a bad thing. Don’t just throw things out without

considering them. Remember that surprises and departures from the expected
can become fulcrums in your composition that can lead you into new key
modulations and new melodic interactions. Sometimes the hardest thing to
do is to find somewhere for your composition to “go.” There are few more
effective and natural sounding transitions than those that evolve from your
melodies’ interactions with themselves.
Counterpoint
Strictly speaking, we have already been working with counterpoint in the last
few examples. Counterpoint is when two or more melodies with different rhyth-
mic phrases occur at the same time. If and when they bump into each other,
they share tonality. Fugues are good examples of counterpoint. J. S. Bach’s
two-part and three-part inventions are well worth listening to in this regard.
Prior to Bach, most music of the 15th and 16th century was contrapuntal and
counter-melodic. Tonal music didn’t really take hold until a little later.
When working with counterpoint, you don’t have to restrict yourself to a single
motif being worked at different times and places in several voices. You can
introduce entirely different melodies for each voice. Later, you can switch
them or develop them in any way you like. 
One musical school of thought works on the premise that in music there are
only melodies. What we call chords are just groups of melody notes that
happen to be played together. This can be a good compositional approach.
You can just write several melodies that work together. At places where sev-
eral melody notes sound together, your music will arrive at some tonal defini-
tion that could be called a chord, but you don’t have to think in terms of
chords, necessarily.
Figure 16-6 shows an example of two different melodies working together to
create a very definite sense of tonality. You can hear the underlying chord
progression, even though there are never more than two notes sounding
together at the same time.
Back in the 17th century, the English composer Henry Purcell wrote several
pieces of music called catches, which were basically extended “rounds.” Most
of these catches were drinking songs whose lyrics were usually about sex,
drinking, and/or music (“sex, drugs, and rock and roll” has been around
longer than you may think). The catches would start with a voice singing a
melody. After eight or sixteen measures, another voice would start at the
beginning, as the first voice continued along. Another eight or sixteen mea-
sures later, a third voice would start. The actual melody would keep changing
over the entire piece, and the tonality of the piece would remain intact even
when the melody overlapped itself. 
202
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Another way to express this idea is to just write chords and derive your
melodies from them as we did in Chapter 8 with non-chord tones. There 
is no reason why you couldn’t extract a melody from the upper chord tone,
another from a middle chord tone, and so on. They don’t have to have the
same rhythmic phraseology.
When combining voices, it’s important to really consider the way each tone
combines with every other tone. So let’s take a little stroll through musical
tones themselves.
The Five Elements of a Musical Tone
No matter what sound you are using in your composition, there are five ingre-
dients that give it its identity. It doesn’t matter if you are using synthesizers,
orchestral or folk instruments, or found sounds — the five ingredients are
always there.
Knowing these ingredients may help you to decide what sounds you want to
write for, or it might help you to find or create the appropriate synthesizer
sounds for your piece. The five elements of a musical tone are as follows:
 Pitch
 Duration
 Intensity
 Timbre
 Sonance

Chapter 16: Composing for Multiple Voices

Pitch
Pitch refers to the particular note that is being sounded. Differences in pitch
are caused by differences in frequency, or how many times a second a string
vibrates back and forth, for example. In the U.S., 440 hertz (vibrations per
second) equals the note we call A. There are other A’s as well, of course. The
A that is an octave lower is 220 hertz, an octave higher is 880 hertz, two
octaves higher is 1760 hertz, and so on. Pitches are indicated by the notes’
position on the staff.
Duration
Duration is the length of the note, or how long its sound lasts. A half note has
a longer duration than a quarter note. The duration of a note can be affected
by the acoustics of a room. If the room has a lot of reverberation, it will
increase the duration of the notes. They will hang in the air awhile after the
musician has stopped playing them.
Intensity
Changes in intensity are indicated in music with dynamic markings such as
pp, mf, f, and so on. Intensity is not always the same as loudness or volume.
Something can be sung or played with intensity and not necessarily be loud,
though the two concepts are connected.
Timbre
Pronounced “tamber,” timbre is the harmonic content, or tone color, of the
musical tone. It is caused by the combinations of overtones that naturally
sound along with the fundamental pitch that was written for the instrumental-
ist to play. These combinations of overtones — also known as harmonics or
partials — provide the “fingerprint” of each different instrument. The reason
a flute sounds different from an oboe, even though both are playing the same
pitch, is because each of these instruments has a different mixture of over-
tones, or harmonic content, inherent in its sound.
Really, the difference between an “Ah” vowel sound and an “Ooh” vowel sound
is nothing more than a difference in harmonic content or timbre (all else being
equal, of course). Most instruments have a timbral palette that includes many
shades of tone color. Part of the study of playing an instrument is learning to
control and draw from this palette. The voice has the most intuitively con-
trolled variety of all the instruments in the timbre department.
204
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Sonance
We are used to thinking of resonance (re-sonance) as something that contin-
ues to sound (re-sound), so we can think of sonance as a sound that is there
and then gone, sounding only once. These brief sounds are also called tran-
sients. An example of sonance could be the noise that a guitar pick makes as
it starts a string in motion, or the little spitting sound at the beginning of a
trumpet note. The hammers of a piano, the scratching of a viola bow, the 
consonants and breathing noises of a singer are more examples of sonance.
Without these noises, the instruments would sound very different indeed.
Though sonance carries no pitch content, it is easy to see how important it 
is as a component of music.
When writing for multiple voices, always have these elements in the back of
your mind. These five elements are all we have to work with in the universe
of music. If you can control these elements in your compositions, you will
find a vast creative playground to explore. You will be better able to choose
which instruments you want to be playing which parts, and you will also
have a better idea of how to substitute synthesizer sounds for real ones.
If you design your synthesizer sounds to replace the timbre, sonance, inten-
sity, duration, and pitch characteristics of an orchestral instrument, instead
of trying to imitate it directly, you will come up with some very interesting
sounds.
Some Do’s and Don’ts 
As you may have noticed, we like to encourage you to break rules from time
to time, but you can save yourself a lot of aggravation and avoid sounding
amateurish if you at least learn to observe a couple of rules for writing for
multiple voices.
Don’t write more than three independent
melodies at one time
If your intention is to create a sense of chaos and leave your listeners confused,
then have at it — but it is almost impossible for a listener to follow four com-
pletely independent melody lines. Even in string quartets it is common for
some instruments to provide parallel or block harmony while the others move
independently. Often one instrument will tacet (rest through a number of mea-
sures) while the others carry on their complicated conversation.
205
Chapter 16: Composing for Multiple Voices

Don’t cross melody lines over each other
This is almost never a good idea, especially when you are writing multiple
voices for the same instrument, such as for two or more singers. This rule
introduces the concept of voice leading. Good voice leading ensures that your
melodies, chord voicings, and harmonic movements maintain a logical rela-
tionship. Introducing unmanageable elements to the tonality of your piece
can completely upset your compositional blend and balance. If you want to
learn more about voice leading, pick up any good book about arranging.
Do be deliberate in the use 
of octaves and unisons 
Often when you are writing for multiple voices, you will find that you have
given the same note to two voices quite accidentally in the middle of some
harmony. Momentarily stepping on the same pitch can weaken the harmonic
movement that you were developing before that point. On the other hand,
unisons and octaves have strengths of their own. Be observant and be inten-
tional. This is a common area where young composers make mistakes.
Do consider tessitura
Tessitura is a term used to describe the average range of a musical part or
piece. It is also used to describe the range of an instrument. If a part is writ-
ten in a high tessitura for a vocal or a wind instrument, the part will take on a
higher energy level. Writing in a lower tessitura generates a more relaxed atti-
tude, with less dynamic range. When writing for multiple voices, dynamic
ranges will actually vary quite a bit if the instruments’ parts aren’t placed
properly within the instruments’ tessitura.
Exercises
For the following exercises, and just in general, it might be a good idea to have
a small, easy-to-use, convenient recording device. The quality isn’t so impor-
tant. A cassette recorder or direct-to-CD recorder would be fine. Recording
one melody and playing or singing a second melody along with it as you
listen back can be very helpful. If you have a computer music recording pro-
gram, you can make your melody loop as you try different things out.

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

1. Write a short melody of four to sixteen measures using only I, IV, and
V chords.
Now add a parallel harmony that stays within the tonality of the piece.
Notice the places where the harmony has to move (or not move) differ-
ently from the melody in order to keep peace with the tonality of the
music.
2. Write a two-part block harmony for a familiar song, or for the melody
you wrote for Exercise 1.
Try to write parts with the least amount of movement possible. Move
them only when harmony notes are doubling the melody (unisons are
not permitted in this exercise).
3. Come up with a simple chord progression and see if you can write two
distinct melodies that work with the chords. Try to fit them together.
4. Take a single melodic motif and see how many ways you can weave it
around itself.
Change registers, keys, and rhythmic phrasing as much as is required to
make a good fit. You might want to try this one with a friend. One of you
could sing or play the motif one way, while the other experiments with
the possibilities.
5. Try to write a harmony to one of your favorite melodies that moves in
different directions and at different times than the melody.
6. Pick your favorite exercise from this chapter and write a third melodic
part using any technique that you have learned.

L
et’s face it: Everybody’s got to make a living.
Sure, in a perfect world, every talented musician would be able to survive
comfortably off of writing pretty love songs and waltzes. But we all know 
for a fact that that is rarely the case. 
Most musicians who make a living off of their music don’t do it through just
writing songs. The music world is full of incredibly talented studio bassists,
guitarists, and drummers with little name recognition outside of the studio.
There are oodles of technically gifted DJs and electronic musicians who make
their real income composing jingles for car commercials.
In the case of the band Stereolab, for example, they made more money from
having one of their songs used in a Volkswagen commercial than they did for
all the albums they had released for nearly a decade prior to the commercial.
Composing for Film
Probably the most lucrative career that a music composer can pursue is com-
posing for the silver screen. This endeavor is complex, challenging, and
fraught with competition. The film composer must have an understanding of

synchronization and editing; must be able to musically conjure a wide variety
of colors and moods; must be able to work with a wide variety of deadlines,
timetables, attitudes, and personalities; and must be adept at switching back
and forth from the computer to the orchestra, from the scene to the score,
and back again.
Fortunately, over the past five years or so, opportunities have grown for dif-
ferent approaches to composition for film. It wasn’t that long ago that almost
everyone writing music for film was trying to create sensationalistic scores.
Think of Star Wars and Jurassic Park, for examples. Almost every film score
sounded like Gustav Holst’s The Planets. It was pretty hard to find a film score
that didn’t rely on sheer bombast and magnitude.
But since then we have had very successful movies with much more under-
played music tracks. Think of The Life Aquatic or Napoleon Dynamite. These
examples show that a simple score can not only be effective, but can also
take on a life of its own. You can expect this trend toward variety to continue
as audiences become bored with the repetition of one or two styles. And with
greater exposure to foreign films, the influences increase — listen to the
music in Water, Frieda, or Kung Fu Hustle.
When composing for film, there is rarely an instance when you can use a piece
of music you previously composed to fit a scene. Almost all music for film
has to be written specifically for the scene. Because film scores often rely on
and return to one or two main themes, you may find a phrase or a motif in
your “saved bits” folder that would be appropriate — but you will have to
make your composition fit perfectly into the exact amount of time required
by the individual scene. You can’t just awkwardly cut from one musical idea
to another without regard to the musicality of the cut itself.
There is an old saying in this business: “You can teach someone to edit music,
but you can’t teach someone to edit musically.” So when the film you are
working on cuts from a tender love scene to an intense car chase scene, the
music has to tell the director’s story without being clumsy or drawing too
much attention to itself.
If an independent film is being produced in your area, you might be able to put
together a demo of your work to present to producers, directors, and filmmak-
ers for consideration. However, you will probably have to do a lot of work for
free at first. Be sure that you retain ownership of all of your copyrights and
publishing if you are not being paid handsomely for your work (see the nearby
sidebar on copyrighting for more information on how to do this).

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Working with time code
Film and video, as you know, are made up of a series of individual frames that
flash by so quickly that we don’t notice the individual frames at all, but see
motion instead. Nonetheless, all of us have paused our DVD players and seen
what an individual frame looks like. It just looks like a still photograph.
Imagine a sudden cut in a movie from a tender love scene to a car chase. There
is what is known as a time code address for the exact frame where the cut
takes place. It might look something like: 1:04:28.13. This means one hour,
four minutes, twenty-eight seconds, and thirteen frames. A time code address
is also referred to as the SMPTE time (Society of Motion Picture and Television
Engineers).
211
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs
Copyrighting your work
We’ve all heard of the “poor man’s copyright,”
which is when you fold a print copy of your com-
position into thirds and mail it to yourself so that
the post office’s dated cancellation mark is
printed directly on the back of the paper. Well,
the “poor man’s copyright” is not actually valid
in U.S. courts. It was overturned in a 1976 copy-
right revision.
Whenever intellectual property is put in a tan-
gible medium, meaning it’s written down or
recorded, it’s automatically copyrighted as of
that moment. The author now has the six basic
rights that copyright gives: 1. the right to repro-
duce, 2. the right to make derivative works, 3.
the right to distribute, 4. the right to perform, 5.
the right to display publicly, and 6. the right to
perform via digital transmission.
One good thing to do with your material is to
register it with the U.S. Copyright Office. This
sounds imposingly legal and possibly very
expensive, but really, it’s neither. It’s a very
simple process that could possibly save you
from a lot of future hassles in court.
To register your musical work with the U.S.
Copyright Office, you first need to download
“Form PA” from the Copyright Office’s site at
www.copyright.gov. After filling out this
form, put it, along with a non-returnable audio
recording of your work to be copyrighted or a
lead sheet or sheet music of the material, and a
check for $45 into a package. Copies should be
legible, and both words and music on the
recording should be clear and audible. The title
of the composition should be clearly written on
the recording and/or sheet music. 
Send the package to: 
Library of Congress
Copyright Office
101 Independence Avenue, S.E.
Washington, D.C. 20559-6000 
This Copyright Office process serves as a
date/depository for intellectual property; how-
ever, just because it’s filed with the Library of
Congress does not mean you’re not infringing
on anyone else’s copyright either. Basically,
they all go to a storage warehouse and wait for
authors to file copyright-infringement lawsuits.
Then they go dig it up for the courts and look at
the time stamps of the submitted original.

Knowing this, you would have a couple of choices in deciding what to do with
the music for that cut. You could
 Cut the music from the love scene and jump in with chase music.
 Use the same music for both scenes.
 Fade the love scene music out while fading the chase scene music in
(crossfade).
 Decide not to use music at all for one of the scenes.
 Compose a piece of music that makes a musical transition from one
mood to another at exactly 1:04:28.13.
There are probably other choices, but these are the most obvious ones to us.
If you switch music at the scene change, you will have to be careful in order
for the transition to sound natural and musical. This means that you will have
to choose a tempo and a starting time code address for the first piece that will
land you on the scene change at a musical point — like the first beat of the
17th measure, or some other musical accent point. This is where computers
come in mighty handy. If you know the exact length in hours, minutes, sec-
onds, and frames of each scene to be scored, and you have a general idea of
your tempo, you can slightly alter the tempo so that you come out at a good
musical transition point at the exact frame you want. 
Working with proxy movies
You will be watching the movie and “shuttling” it back and forth — 
continuously stopping and rewinding the film, or fast-forwarding it in order 
to get a feel for the overall film or just a single section you want to score — 
as you come up with your musical ideas. The movie is loaded into your com-
puter software along with your music. You don’t really need to work with a
high-resolution copy of the film, so it is a good idea to request a proxy movie.
A proxy movie is a copy of the movie made at lower resolution. Lower resolu-
tion means lower quality, but high-resolution movies require a lot of process-
ing power from your computer, and you want to save the processing power
for your musical compositions. Later, after you export your work onto the
proxy movie, your music can be transferred over to the high-res version of
the movie. Proxy movies have all the same content as the high-res version as
far as scenes and SMPTE addresses are concerned, they just have smaller file
sizes so you can work faster.
212
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Composing for Video Games
Composing music for video games is another exciting way to go as a composer.
The music from the Legend of Zelda series may be some of the most recogniz-
able instrumental music of the decade. Currently music composition for video
games relies heavily on MIDI. There have been a few notable exceptions, but
in general video game developers put music fairly low on the list of things to
allocate game memory for. Gaming is about the game play. On the other hand,
the wrong music can really hurt a game’s popularity, so game developers do
care about it. The music gives the game an important part of its character.
Whether you are or aren’t a gamer, you should study the way music is used in
games if you want to be successful at this field of composition. Usually, there
are at least four or five pieces of music that are connected with certain areas
of game play. There might be music for wandering around, for doing battle,
for equipping your character, for being first in a race, and so on. 
Sometimes a gamer will hear the same piece of music over and over again for
quite long periods of time. The music has to either be good enough to stand
the test of extended game play, or be invisible enough to provide a mood
without demanding too much of the gamer’s attention.
Music for video games can be composed from old, unfinished compositions
you may have lying around, or you can come up with brand new music. You
can live anywhere once you have a game or two under your belt, but it is hard
to get a start in this field. We suggest you do some surfing on the Internet to
find out who the game developers in your area are, if any, and contact them.
Put together a demo reel of short examples of your musical compositions.
Just give them ten or twelve seconds worth of eight or nine contrasting musi-
cal ideas. Try to edit them together so that the whole collection has a flow to
it and doesn’t sound too disjointed. 
Along with MIDI, there are other technical considerations when composing
for video games, so you will have to be technically inclined, but at first you
should concentrate on the musical side. If you are technically inclined, the
rest will come in time.
Composing for TV and Radio
Composing music for television shows is kind of a cross between composing
for film and composing for video games. You will usually need to come up
with several themes that get used frequently, but you have to continue to
write custom music for certain types of TV shows. Sometimes the theme
213
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

song for a TV show and the incidental music are composed by different
people. There is a lot more prestige and consequently more money involved
in theme songs, but often these are commissioned works written by high-
profile artists.
This field is also very difficult to break into, and you will need to pound the
pavement with a good, well-edited, short demo that contains as much variety
as you can pack into it. One good idea is to find local television productions
that require custom music. A couple of those under your belt can help your
quest. There may be a public access station in your area, and you may find
some enthusiastic novice television producers who would love some musical
contributions. And look for people making documentaries. You will probably
work for free for awhile.
Writing music for advertising can be a very lucrative career if you can break
into the big-time national market. Local merchants often use selections from
the many libraries of stock music tracks for their ads, but if a merchant wants
their name in the jingle, someone will have to compose the piece for them,
and it could be you. If you find this kind of job, you will be working mostly
with 30-second spots with a few 60-second radio and 15-second spots every
now and then. The 30-second jingles actually have to be 29 seconds long.
There is no room for running short or long in this arena, so you have to
develop a feel for composing a complete piece of music with a beginning,
middle, and end that runs exactly 29 seconds.
An advantage to the young composer writing music for advertising is that
you almost always get to work with the top musicians in your area. You will
meet people who are comfortable working with a click track (metronome),
can read charts, and are familiar with the working environment of the record-
ing studio.
Don’t go into this field believing that you are going to be able to make much
of a creative statement in your music. You will receive direction from produc-
ers, agency representatives, musicians, and even corporate executives or
their representatives. Sometimes their direction will make sense to you, but
often you will find yourself losing control of your work. Be ready to let it go.
Consider yourself somewhat successful if you are being paid for your work.
In the jingle scene, the simpler the music is, the better. The idea is to com-
pose something that will stick in the listeners’ heads without going over
those same heads. A challenging or provocative piece of music will slow
everything down, invite criticism and skepticism, and probably someone
higher up the food chain will have his or her way with the piece until you
yourself are sorry for the infraction you committed against the less is more
rule governing the jingle music business.
In this field you are expected to work very quickly. If you need time to come
up with ideas or make changes to your writing, jingles might not be the right
direction for you to go in. You might get a little scrap of lyrics and a sense of
214
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

the musical style desired on a Monday afternoon — and be expected to record
your piece that Wednesday morning. On the other hand, having tight dead-
lines can motivate you. Steve Horelick, composer of the music for Reading
Rainbow, once said, “The best motivation for me to complete a composition
is someone holding a gun to my head and saying, ‘I need it tomorrow.’”
You will probably do a lot of jingle demos for free before you actually sell one
to a client or a music house. You should feel fortunate if the studio time is
being paid for on behalf of your work in the meantime. Again, a compilation
demo of your work is very important (see the final section in this chapter for
more on demos). People in the professional creative world will not give you
very much time to demonstrate your talent, so you have to squash it all
down into a short tour of your past successes.
Look on the Internet or in the local yellow pages for music production houses
and advertising agencies. These days many music houses are one-person
operations, so you may meet with some dead ends. Not all ad agencies handle
radio and TV, but be persistent and businesslike and try to get your demo
into as many hands and ears as possible.
It is also a good idea to study the jingles that are currently airing. You will
often be asked to copy their style, so you will be expected to know what is
going on in the field.
Composing for the Orchestra
The personal and emotional rewards for composing commercial music for a
concert orchestra to perform are hard to beat. The creative freedom of not
having to answer to the demands of a movie scene or an advertising execu-
tive is intoxicating. Even a high school band or choir performing your compo-
sitions can have you oozing pride and a sense of accomplishment. And there
is always a chance that a more respected orchestra could decide to play one
of your compositions in concert. You may even have your piece recorded and
released on CD. Most of us dream of the immortality that a successful compo-
sition can bring.
These emotions are often not enough to drive a young composer to get a
composition ready for a good orchestra. Money for new compositions is very
hard to come by. It can be extremely difficult to find an orchestra willing to
take on the task of rehearsing and preparing to perform works by unknown
composers. Motivation can run out before anyone has even looked at your
score. Set some self-imposed deadlines for getting your piece done. Hold a
gun to your own head and say, “I need it tomorrow.”
You can apply for grants if your work qualifies. Find someone who knows how
to write grants or go on the Internet and do some research. A demo of your
composition done in MIDI can be helpful — but if it is poorly executed it can
215
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

actually be hurtful. Talk to high schools and colleges in your area. Some
schools take pride in performing works by local or regional composers.
There might be some semi- or non-professional performance ensembles in
your area that could be open to experimentation. It is easier to get a string
quartet played than it is to get a symphony played simply because of the
number of musicians involved.
Good orchestral musicians are in the habit of being paid for their services, so
if you have the money you could produce your own performance event. This
is an expensive proposition, so it would be a good idea to have it profession-
ally recorded while it is being performed. The extra cost will be less than
trying to make a recording happen at another time (although you can do this
too, if you like).
Composing for Yourself
Similarly to composing for an orchestra, this is perhaps the toughest road
towards making a living with your music — but the most rewarding road in
terms of feeding your muse and drawing from your untrammeled creativity.
There aren’t any limits or restrictions on what instruments or sounds you
use; you don’t have to stay in a particular key signature; you are not limited
to portraying a particular vision other than your own; you can work with
whomever you please.
This is a perfect path for you if you are independently wealthy, infinitely
patient, indomitably persistent, or any combination of these things. Or
maybe you just want to hear your musical ideas played back on a CD and
couldn’t care less about monetary success or fame. There are some very tal-
ented musical minds at work out there who can’t get anyone to listen to their
work. And there are a lot of wannabe composers out there who don’t really
have all that much talent. One might argue that there are a few who have hit
the big time somehow without a lot of talent to back up their success.
There are many ways to the top of the mountain, and there are many different
mountains to climb in the music world. You have to define what success means
to you. Don’t let someone else define it for you.
The Internet is probably the best marketplace for your work if you are com-
posing for yourself. There are many ways to market yourself on the Internet.
You could create your own Web site and/or start a page on MySpace or
Facebook. You can get an account with download services such as iTunes or
distribute your product through services such as CDBaby.com. No matter
which of these directions you take (maybe all of them), you still have to get
people to go to your music somehow. For that, you might enlist the help of
someone who can optimize your Web presence to give you and your music
greater exposure.
216
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

The one rule we would suggest for you to follow in order to carve a place for
yourself in the music world is not to follow any rules (except maybe this one).
If you are composing for yourself, you have only yourself to please. If your
music sounds like everyone else’s, you won’t leave much of an impression.
Nearly every composer who has earned the honor of being remembered did
something new when they were composing. We don’t remember the copies,
only the originals. If no one is commissioning your work, you have nothing to
lose by being genuinely original. On the other hand, remember that there is
really nothing new under the sun. You are working with the same twelve
tones that everyone else has had to work with. But that doesn’t mean you
can’t put things together in new ways.
Composing Teams 
One good, tried-and-true way to get work in film, television, or video game 
scoring is to apply to work with a composing team. Composing teams are com-
panies that are contacted directly by production companies to write and per-
form scores for their films, shows, and games. Many professional musicians
217
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs
Mark Mothersbaugh, founder of Mutato Muzika
I got involved in scoring films because a friend
of mine, Paul Reubens, asked me if I would
score a TV show for him. And that’s kind of
where it started, with Pee-Wee’s Playhouse.
Since then, I’ve done music supervision, I’ve
done scoring, and I also write songs for films,
too. Sometimes I just come in for a couple of
days and write a song, depending on what the
movie is, or what the company needs. For some
of my projects, like Rugrats, for instance, I wrote
eight or nine songs that ended up being part of
the characters’ dialog — music that ended up
being integral to the movie, as opposed to writ-
ing songs that were added onto the storyline.
When people come to me for film scores, it’s
usually because they heard something I did that
made them interested. A while ago, I scored a
movie called Welcome to Collinwood that was
a very, very small film. It was kind of Oscar
Peterson/Django Reinhardt, very fast bebop
jazz, and immediately afterwards, people are
calling me up about that because they were
looking for someone who could do that type of
retro music.
There are people who have heard things I did in
Devo or like the projects I’ve done with Wes
Anderson, and they’re looking for that kind of
sound. I rarely get called to do horror films. I’ve
done television projects that were horror pro-
jects, but feature films — you know, people tend
to get categorized, and so they end up going to
a Marco Beltrami or a Chris Young for horror
soundtracks, since they’ve both done so many
of those types of scores. And then those guys,
too, they have the same dilemma where they
don’t want to be typecast horror-movie guys, so
they actively seek out projects where they can
break out of the genre.

have worked in composing teams, such as Devo’s Mark Mothersbaugh, who
founded the West Hollywood music production company Mutato Muzika, and
Camper Van Beethoven’s Jonathan Segel, who worked at Danetracks. 
Composing teams have been very popular in the world of animation, since
pretty much right from the beginning. What would Bugs Bunny have done
without Carl Stalling — or Donald Duck without Spike Jones to provide
accompaniment to his pratfalls? Animation features and shorts almost always
have a musical segment included, and because there is such a need for music
in this field, there’s a much better chance of breaking in as a beginner.
Check the credits of your favorite animated television show (or your kids’
favorite shows) to see who’s providing the music. If it’s a company name, and
not an individual’s, this is a place you can send your resume. Requirements
for becoming part of a composing team include existing talent and ability in
writing the type/style of music that the team works with, great people skills
(to get along with and work with other team members), and living in an area
where these teams exist.
As of yet, long-distance teams that collaborate via the Internet or some other
method are not common, but Web companies such as Rocket Network are
working hard to create extensive online collaboration networks that may
soon change the way composing teams are formed and operated.
You can also try and find out if composing teams exist in the city/town you
live in and make yourself known to the people in charge of the teams. Get
your demo to them and emphasize your willingness to work on the team 
with the other composers. Once hired, make sure that you’re at least getting
cue sheet credit for ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors &
Publishers), BMI (Broadcast Music Incorporated), and/or SESAC (Society of
European Stage Authors and Composers) royalties for the music you write —
even if you’re not getting screen credit. Without cue sheet credit, you’re only
ghostwriting, which has its own set of challenges, one of which is a flimsy-
looking résumé.
Helpful Organizations and Web Sites
There is nothing more important when working in the film industry than
being persistent. Talented musicians are born every day, but truly persistent
ones are made, not born.
If you aren’t spending most of your time between musical jobs sending out a
stack of résumés and demos and researching possible job opportunities
every single day, then you probably are not going to make it.

For the past 30 years, the American Composer’s Forum aim has been to join
communities with composers and performers, with the goal of encouraging
the creation of new music. The site includes lots of news for musicians and
composers alike, as well as job opportunities and links to other members of
the prestigious organization. 
American Composer’s Forum,

Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

Working with Agents
Unless you are working full-time for a company, you’re going to be considered
a freelance musician by most people you deal with — which can be both good
and bad for your working relationships. On the bad side, if the company can
find someone cheaper than you who is just as good, or merely adequate, they’ll
probably go with that composer. Another bad aspect of being a freelancer is
that a disreputable company might decide not to pay you for work completed,
or cut the project off just short of completion and steal your composition.
Unless you’ve got a great lawyer on your side and a lot of time on your hands,
these cases are almost always hopeless for the freelance composer. 
On the good side, as a freelancer you get to choose your own work hours and
most often work from home. You have to own your own equipment, of course,
but that also means you get to work on the equipment that you’re most com-
fortable with. Also, if you get a hinky feeling about a company that you’re
working with, and you can afford to withdraw from the project, you have the
choice of dropping them and approaching a different company for work
instead.
When you hire an agent, a lot of the bad aspects of freelancing change. For one
thing, a good agent will find work for you and, having a stake in whatever
money you make, will only approach companies that have a good reputation.
So, no more getting ripped off. Secondly, many bigger production companies,
such as Disney, absolutely will not work with anyone or any company not
represented by an agency. Most television stations also only work with an
artist or company through an agent. 
There are, of course, horror stories about musicians’ agents, but most of
them have to do with choosing an agent without checking his or her reputa-
tion first. The best way to find an agent is to find out what agencies represent
some of the musicians or composers you admire — easily found by a quick
search on the Internet. Start with those agents first and see where that gets
you. Many times, even if these agents turn you down, they’ll refer you to a
another agent that might suit your needs better.
Songwriting
Just about everyone has written at least one song in their life, whether it was
as a three-year-old making up new lyrics to “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” or,
later, playing around with chord progressions and making up lyrics on the
spot to accompany the resulting instrumental. The fact of the matter is that
writing songs isn’t very difficult. However, writing good songs, or at least songs
that other people outside of your immediate family can truly enjoy, can be
very hard. 
220
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Good songwriters use form to give their songs the emotional impact needed to
make them memorable. Just like the easiest poems to remember and even —
on a much less sophisticated level — rally cheers and anthems have some
sort of rhyming or rhythmic structure to them. The songs that are easiest for
audiences to truly connect with are the ones built according to form. The way
songs are put together is not arbitrary, and forms weren’t invented just to
create formula songs without depth or originality. These forms exist and per-
sist because songwriters, and audiences, have found that they help listeners
to understand and remember the message at the heart of a song. Chapter 13
talks a lot more about form.
Even when your songs come spontaneously, there will come a point when you
have to decide what form you want to use (we go into form in more detail
later in this section). Sometimes you may come up with a single verse or a
chorus idea first. After that first flash of inspiration and an exploration of
what you want the song to say, you need to have an idea of the type of form
you want to use to help you get your idea, or the story behind your song,
across most effectively. You may do that unconsciously, as a natural result of
having listened to and studied music all your life.
But sometimes — especially if you’ve only listened to bubblegum pop, or rap
music, or math rock — you may not be able to write anything that doesn’t
sound like a blatant imitation of a song you’re already familiar with. You have
to remember that what you already know or feel about form could be limiting. 
Deciding on lyrics and tempo
If you’re starting from a lyric, the mood and subject matter will probably dic-
tate the tempo of the music. If it’s a happy song that demands an up-tempo
sort of rhythm to it, you might want to use a form with just a few sections,
such as AAA or ABA. If it’s a slow or mid-tempo ballad — for example, a good
country ballad like Hank Williams’ “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” — you can
use either the longer or shorter forms.
If you’re writing your lyrics first, then you’re going to have to choose a beat
that works with those lyrics. If your lyrics use a lot of multisyllabic words, or
if you have a lot of short words that fit together in long phrases, then you’re
probably going to need to choose a fast beat that matches the rhythm of your
dialog. Listen to anything by a fast-singing punk rock band, such as early
Suicidal Tendencies or Husker Dü to see what we mean.
On the folk music front, compare the lyrical tempo of one of Bob Dylan’s
especially wordy songs, such as “Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,” to “Just Like 
a Woman.” There’s no way that you could take the lyrics of “Leopard-Skin”
and set it to the beat of “Just Like A Woman” — the words wouldn’t fit rhyth-
mically against the music, and you would end up with a lot of words left over
at the end of the song. 
221
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

The tempo you choose for your song will be also at least partially determined
by how easy it is to sing your lyrics. If your song is rhythmically clumsy, a
fast tempo may tie knots in your tongue trying to get them all in. Think of
Shakespeare and his constant use of iambic pentameter. Not only do his
words sound nice to the ear, but they’ve been easy for performers to repeat
without fear to being tongue-tied for more than 400 years. If you want a rapid-
fire, one-syllable-per-eighth or sixteenth note lyric, you have to be extra care-
ful that the words are easy to pronounce and sing together. It’s a good idea to
experiment with a metronome by singing or speaking the lyric against various
tempo settings. 
Fewer words to a song generally pose fewer problems, but the challenge is to
phrase them in an interesting way against the rhythm. You can stretch short
spoken phrases against slow musical phrases easily drawing short words out
as Hank Williams and Patsy Cline did in their music, or by using long pauses
between phrases like Leonard Cohen sometimes does. In songs with few words,
the way you deliver your lines — or the way your singer delivers your lines —
is just as important as the words used.
Building rhythm
We discuss how you can build rhythm around a lyrical phrase in Chapter 4.
Now it’s time to explore that a little more. Take a phrase from Henry Purcell’s
Dido and Aeneas:
Thy hand, Belinda! Darkness shades me,
If you were to break it up simply by spoken rhythmic accents, it would look
like Figure 17-1.

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Note this basic rule when matching lyrics to beats in music: Weak (unac-
cented) syllables are usually placed at weak metric points — those that are
weaker than those where the surrounding accented syllables occur. An
accented syllable may occur at any place, but an unaccented syllable before
or after an accented syllable must fall on a rhythmic point weaker or equal in
strength, meaning that weak syllables should occur on upbeats when next to
a strong syllable. Of course, eventually, rules are meant to be broken, and
many outstanding, musically rebellious songwriters — such as psychedelia’s
poster child, Donovan — made a lasting career of fitting lyrical accents
against musical downbeats. 
If we wanted to use this naturally occurring rhythm in a piece of music, we
could write it as shown in Figures 17-2 through 17-4.

Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

Any one of those rhythmic patterns could, and does, work for the Purcell
phrase. As does (naturally) the one he actually used (Figure 17-5).
As you can see in Figure 17-5, Purcell managed to stick to the convention of
matching weak and strong accents in his lyrics with the weak and strong
beats of each measure, yet still managed to present his lyrics in a completely
different rhythmic pattern than the more obvious patterns that were avail-
able to him.
Choosing your form
Once you’ve set the tempo and decided on the delivery of your lyrics, you’ve
begun to lock yourself into your form. If it takes one minute to get through a
verse and chorus, and you’re looking for a three-minute song, your options
have already shrunk further.
You should also consider how much space you’re going to need to tell your
story. Though it’s always a good idea to condense, the AAA... form, or the
one-part song form, gives you the most room to stretch lyrically. But it leaves
no room for a chorus or a catchy hook. A lot of folk music is written in this
form, and it’s a good medium for telling a musical story. 
Ternary forms (ABA, AABA, compound AABA, and so on — see Chapter 13 for
more on song forms) can give you plenty of lyric space as well as room to
develop a strong musical foundation, particularly if you use pre-choruses 
to present new lyric information each time. One-section and two-section
(ABABAB) forms at fast tempos are easy to write long, complicated lyrical
stories to — however, they can be melodically boring because the melodies
repeat so often.
On the other hand, if you stick to writing spare, condensed lyrics, you have
many musical options available to you. You can either set your lyrics to a fast
tempo — for example, a rock song — or set them against a slow ballad. Either
way will leave plenty of room to accommodate the individual phrasing styles
of different singers. Spare lyrics presented in a slower tempo have more of an

obligation to be interesting, which means bring in a good vocalist to deliver
them, or have a good voice yourself. You’re making the listener wait for that
lyric to unfold, and it had better be worth the wait! The same is true, of
course, of the music.
Eventually, like anything else, once you work with these forms, they become
second nature to you. You’ll also find that you will get yourself into problem-
atic situations for which you will have to find creative solutions. A substantial
amount of innovation in music is initiated by a need to find a graceful way out
of a jam. If you already have a repertoire of solutions, you’re ahead of the game.
In the beginning
Sometimes the first five seconds of a song are the hardest to come up with.
You may know you want to write something, but you may only have a vague
idea or a feeling about what it is you want to express. Or you may even know
exactly what you want to say, but have little or no idea how you would get
your idea across to another person.
There is a lot of pressure put on songwriters to make that first five seconds
the most interesting for the listener, too. How many times have you flipped
around on the radio, listening to a second here, a second there, before set-
tling on the one song that grabs your attention?
The first couple of seconds of your song are also the most important because
if you start well, you’ll have a lot less trouble down the line. Once you get
past the beginning, many times, the music and lyrics dictate where it’s going
to go on its own, and you just have to grab hold and try to keep it on track. 
Many times songwriters begin writing a song by grabbing an existing song
that they like and writing completely new lyrics for it. From there, they
modify the music to match the mood and then work on the lyrics some more
to match the new music, and continue editing and rewriting the music and
lyrics until they either come up with something they’re happy with or toss
the song into their “scrap file” to be worked on or used for something else
later. This technique works especially well when you’ve got a group of people
together to work with (your band, for example), where everyone can add
their input on where the original song should change and the identifying
traits of the new song should begin.
Another way to begin a song is to just play around with chord progressions.
Most pop songs use the same chord progressions — jazz musicians often
make fun of pop musicians for playing only three-chord songs — so, if the
basic chord progressions you come up with sound too familiar to you, don’t
sweat it.
225
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

Chord progressions can’t be copyrighted; only lyrics and melodies can be
copyrighted.
Still one more way to start a song is to think of a title for it first. A good title
can lead to specific images and ideas you want in your song. For example,
you could decide to call your song “Nice Shoes.” From that title, you could
start writing phrases about watching a person walking, what you think of when
you see that person’s shoes or where they’re going, and so forth. Musically,
the title and words could lend themselves to the rhythm of a person’s gait —
sauntering, pacing nervously, jogging, or what have you. From there, the music
could decide whether it was a menacing or sad song with lots of minor chords
or a happy, carefree song using mostly major chord progressions.
Action words, short phrases, or specific images work well as inspiring titles. 
Making your song moody
The mood of the song determines the music you put to your lyrics — or, if
you are a songwriter who’s more comfortable writing music first and then
working on lyrics, the mood of the music you write will determine how your
lyrics are interpreted by your audience. If you present happy lyrics set in a
dark-sounding minor key, or if you put a very depressing set of lyrics to a
happy-sounding upbeat tune (such as Morrissey of The Smiths used to do),
your audience will think you’re being ironic or sarcastic — and if that’s the
feeling you want to get across, then you’ll have succeeded. However, if that’s
not what you were intending, then you probably want to head back to the old
drawing board. 
A good rule of thumb is to remember that all music is a form of communica-
tion, and a song with lyrics is perhaps the most blatant form of musical com-
munication. Not only are you talking to your audience through your words,
but you are talking to them through your music as well. If a lyrical phrase in
your song asks a question, then the music can go up at the end of the musical
phrase right along with the words. If the lyrics are quiet and somber in a sec-
tion of an otherwise loud and boisterous song, there’s no reason why the
music can’t get as quiet and spare as the vocalist singing the lyrics in that
part of the song. Ideally, even if the vocals were removed, the emotional mes-
sage should still be clearly carried by the music. 
The hook
“Don’t bore us, take us to the chorus.”
This is a dictum among song publishers. What it means is that your song
needs to have a hook, and the listener shouldn’t have to wait around too long
for it. A hook is a phrase or group of phrases that sums up the idea of the
226
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

song, sticks in your head like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth, and
repeats throughout your song at critical points. It is the part of the song that
will be remembered (sometimes begrudgingly) when the rest of the song is
long forgotten.
Usually the hook is the chorus, but not always. Sometimes an instrumental
interlude between verses can be a hook (think of the guitar part to
“Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones). What we can say about hooks is that 
if your song doesn’t have one, you will have a hard time finding anyone to
publish or perform it.
So where do hooks come from? 
Many places. They can come from common expressions in daily use. Every
generation has its jargon. For example, how often do you hear someone say,
“It’s all good”? How about “24/7”? Many expressions go into and out of popu-
larity over the years; any of them can be a good starting point for coming up
with a memorable hook. Listen to conversations and try to observe which
simple phrases get used a lot. They don’t even have to have a lot of depth.
You will be able to provide depth when you begin to flesh them out.
Sometimes a hook comes from putting a new spin on a common idea. It can
even come from putting a new spin on a common musical idea. Originally, rock
and roll utilized snare accents on beat 2, the and of beat 2, and beat 4. At some
point the and of 2 was dropped and accents were put only on 2 and 4. Then
someone tried accenting all four beats with the snare. These were small
changes in the drums, but they provided a large change in feel and provided
musical hooks. Christopher Cross used a major ninth chord in “Sailing.”
Hendrix introduced us to the 7 sharp 9 chord. If you use the same hook a lot,
it can become your little identifying trademark. If you use the same hook too
much, it can make you a one-hit-wonder.
One common songwriting technique is to start with a strong musical or lyrical
phrase — it doesn’t matter which. This phrase will likely become the hook, but
it probably won’t be the very first thing that we hear in the finished song. You
are going to build up to it with your music and/or lyrics. Think of other lyrical
or musical ideas that support this phrase. Toss the phrase around in your head
for a couple of weeks until it magnetically starts to gather more words, more
music, more storyline ideas, and generally develops into a hook. Now you can
write verses that lead to the climax that your hook should provide.
Your hook will probably end up being the song title, but not the first lyrics
the listener hears. Not many songs actually start right out with the title in the
lyrics. So try writing your hooks first. That way you will at least be sure your
songs have them. Even if the phrase you work with doesn’t become a hook, it
is often a good idea to write songs from the inside out and not necessarily
force yourself to start writing your song from the beginning.

Making a Great Demo
You are going to need to put together a demonstration recording of your work.
There are still a few places where sheet music scores may be enough to get you
in the door, but the music world has gotten used to the idea that your calling
card should be in an easily-accessible audio format. If you are a songwriter,
your demo should include a few songs in their entirety, but to get into the
custom music composition world, you are going to have to do some cutting
and pasting (or have it done for you) to create a short recording compiling
excerpts of a variety of your works. 
Keep it short
Most people in the music business in the position to hire you or pay for your
music aren’t going to give you much time to make an impression. If you are
fortunate enough to arrange an interview or submit a demo, you will be
expected to deliver a brief but complete musical picture of yourself in about
ten minutes. Maybe three of these will be taken up by listening to your demo. 
Because most compositions follow structural forms such as AABA and so on,
it is not uncommon for people to just listen to your music through the first B
section and then skip ahead to the next piece. Don’t be offended by this. In
228
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 
Selling yourself 
Composing music is an art. If you want to make
any money at it, however, it’s also a business.
Unfortunately, most creative types are not nec-
essarily very good at selling themselves in a
persistent and organized way. For some reason,
the idea of sales and marketing seems to strike
fear and loathing in the hearts of many. The fact
is that the only people in the world who can
claim to have only one job are salespeople.
Everyone else has to be a bit of a salesperson
from time to time along with whatever else they
think of as their career.
When you consider it, you are selling every time
you try to persuade anyone to do anything.
Everything from convincing your kids that they
should eat their greens to suggesting a good
book to a friend involves the very skills that you
need to promote your music. One reason that 
it seems harder to sell a song to a publisher 
than it is to sell beans to your 4-year-old is
because it is hard to draw the line between
enthusiasm and boastfulness. It always seems
more appropriate for someone else to say great
things about you than to say them yourself.
Along with this, you might not be so confident
that your work is really any good to start with.
In fact, if you like your own work too much you
run the risk of getting stuck at your current level,
because you aren’t seeing the areas that need
improvement. Because of this, it is often a good
idea to find an agent or manager to help get
your stuff out there. Still there are a lot of things
you can do for yourself, and some composers
are very good at promoting themselves.

fact, what you should do is cut out only the choicest moments from as diverse
a variety of your works as possible, and paste them together in a musical —
or at least interesting — way. Try to edit these snippets into logical musical
phrases. Sometimes you can cut out a nice phrase that includes a complete
lyrical thought. Other times you will want to use four-, eight-, twelve-, or 
sixteen-measure cuts, as these lengths are often the natural length of a 
musical phrase.
Only include the best stuff
Find the most exciting moments of your music. You need to be able to listen
with a certain amount of pride if you end up sitting there while your demo is
getting played. Nothing is worse than a flash of embarrassment or feeling the
need to apologize for some awkward moment playing on your demo.
Organize it
The order of selections on your demo is also important. Start with your best
work, and follow it with something that contrasts with it. Be careful not to have
pieces in the same key or with the same groove or attitude back to back. You
can fade one out as the next one fades in. You can butt them right up against
each other so that the last beat of one is also the first beat of another. You
can put a little space between them if you want the listener to reflect on the
mood of a certain piece, or if the key change between the two pieces is a little
too challenging to the ear. Break up the landscape and present as diverse a
musical palette as possible. Be creative. That’s what they want to hear.
In short, you need to treat the creation of your demo CD as a composition
itself. It is a medley of your greatest hits (even if they are future hits). 
Have more ready to go
You should also have available the full-length versions of your recorded works.
If someone likes your demo they may be willing to give you their ears for a lot
longer. They will then want to hear how you develop your ideas from begin-
ning to end. They will want to get a feel for your sense of music. But they
won’t give you much time at first. We have listened to many excellent demos
that tell a very complete story about the artist’s work in 90 seconds. A minute
and a half is the perfect length if you are good with editing.
Don’t make your demo longer than three minutes.
229
Chapter 17: Composing Commercial Music and Songs

Identify yourself
Make sure that anything you leave with anyone — be it a CD, resume, cover
letter, or whatever — includes your contact information. Your name, phone
number(s), email, and address need to be on every item. If your resume is
more than a page long, put your contact info on all pages. Put it on the CD
label and on the jewel case. Often pages get separated, and CDs get left out of
the case. You don’t want to make people search for your information if they
want to contact you.
Invest in quality
All this information assumes that you have recordings of your work, of course,
or can have some recordings made. The usefulness of demo recordings cannot
be overstressed, but a poor recording or a poor performance can often do 
you more harm than good. If you are going to invest your own money in your
dreams of becoming a recognized music composer, the best investment is to
somehow procure professional quality recordings of good performances of
your work. If you can do it yourself, great. But most often, the wise choice is 
to concentrate on the music and let a professional help you with the technical
side. At the end you will at least get to hear your completed work, and that is
really the main point of writing it in the first place, isn’t it?
Copyright it
One last thing: Be sure to register a PA (performing arts) copyright form with
the Library of Congress before sending your stuff around (see earlier sidebar
on this). Most professionals in this business aren’t interested in stealing your
material, but in the age of the Internet, publishers are wary of works that
have not been copyright protected. The fear is that you may have put your
music out on the Internet, and someone else could have easily filed a copy-
right using a download of your music. Publishers and record companies don’t
want to risk being sued for copyright infringement, so show them that you
have been careful; copyright your compositions.

Composing Electronic Music
In This Chapter
 Checking out sequencers, digital audio workstations, and computerized music notation
 Visiting digital sound libraries
 Looping your compositions
 Scrapbooking with your computer
Your average electronic home-recording musician has to know almost 
as much about computers as he or she does about music itself. The
amount of necessary (and unnecessary) pieces of music hardware and soft-
ware is constantly growing and evolving, so much so that many musicians
long for the days when a four-track tape recorder was the height of home-
recording technology.
That said, electronic music is here and likely to stay. This chapter introduces
you to many of its advantages and limitations.
Software and Hardware for Composition
If you’re the type of musician who likes to spend as much time experimenting
with technology as writing and recording music, then learning how to use
new technology isn’t much of a problem. There is a fascinating array of new
instruments and programs to work with, from ultra-sensitive microphones
that can record insects’ voices and the steady slurping of deciduous trees, to
keyboards with three playable sides to each key that can produce microtones
and previously impossible chord constructions. 
However, if you’re the type of musician who has to be dragged kicking and
screaming to the 21st century of home recording, then the playback capabili-
ties of a MIDI theremin probably don’t interest you. And that’s okay. If this is
the case, there are really just a few software — or combined software and
hardware — packages that come in handy.

Sequencers and digital audio workstations
For composers who are more comfortable composing music on an instrument
than sitting down and writing down notes, a good sequencing program such
as any generation of Cubase, Sonar, ProTools, or LogicPro is a great place to
start. Although early sequencers required a composer to sit down at a com-
puter and plug notes into a staff by use of a mouse — or, worse yet, a 
computer keyboard — most modern sequencing programs come with input
hardware that fits right into an input jack in your computer. This way, if you
want to compose your music on any MIDI-capable instrument, such as a
guitar, a keyboard, or a microphone, you can play the music right into the
computer. There, the music is saved for future editing. Generally, when MIDI
hardware accompanies a sequencing software package, the combination of
the two is called a digital audio workstation.
Many sequencing programs have the capability to record as many as 70 tracks.
Some claim to be able to record an infinite number of tracks. This means that
you can play a melody line on an instrument, record it, play an accompaniment
to the melody line for the second track, lay down a rhythm track on top of that,
throw another instrument into the mix for the next track, and so on.
Sequencers are great to work with if you want to cut sections of music or spe-
cific instrument tracks out of existing compositions. They’re also fantastic for
creating your own loops, which can be used directly after composition to throw
into your full-length compositions (more on looping later in this chapter).
The downside of many music sequencers is that they have only limited music-
notation capabilities and are only able to follow and notate a simple melody
line being played. The latest sophisticated hardware/software sequencer
packages, such as LogicPro and CakeWalk, are able to notate much more
complicated pieces of music.
Music notation software: scorewriters
For the composer who wants to write sheet music for other musicians to
follow, or even create original pieces of music for publication purposes,
music notation software called a scorewriter is important to know how to use.
Although older, less-sophisticated scorewriters insist that a composer plug
the notes into a staff directly by use of a mouse or keyboard, newer versions
of Finale, Encore, and Capella allow a user to plug a keyboard or other MIDI
instrument directly into a piece of accompanying hardware and play the
music directly into the computer, just like a sequencer. Then the software
interprets what you played and produces the written music notation for it.
232
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Scorewriters make it very easy for a composer to write different sections of
the same piece of music for a variety of instruments, such as brass and wood-
wind instruments. The program automatically does the transpositions neces-
sary for instruments set in specific keys, which is very handy when you are
playing the music to be notated on a keyboard or guitar. 
There are also a few scorewriters available with optical character recognition
(OCR) capabilities. This means that you can scan a piece of music directly
into your computer — via a scanner, of course — and then either edit that
piece of music through the scorewriter program or play it through the pro-
gram’s MIDI output to see what it sounds like. Programs with this feature
include SmartScore and Sibelius.
Repetition and the computer
As we have seen from previous chapters, repetition plays a large role in music
composition. Binary and ternary compositional forms include repeating
motifs and the storytelling concepts of statement, development, departure, and
resolution or recapitulation. The central concept is this: If something is worth
listening to once, it’s probably worth listening to twice (or more).
Computer-aided composition benefits from the computer’s editing prowess
and greatly speeds up composition. You can structure an eight-measure phrase
and, instead of having to write it all again, you can simply copy and paste it
into the next eight measures. Once copied, you can make changes to it as you
see fit. You can add and delete material and experiment with any aspect of
the phrase or motif you like. You can paste it in again as many times and in as
many places as necessary. You can then compose another eight measures —
say, for a bridge or a chorus — and perform the same copy, cut, and paste
operations with it. Modern computer programs make this all very easy. 
233
Chapter 18: Composing Electronic Music
What is MIDI?
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface. It’s basically a process that digitizes
the timbre and quality of sound coming out of an
instrument, meaning the attack, vibrato, modu-
lation, sustain, and so forth — the things that
make up the “feel” of an instrument’s specific
sound. Then, because the sound is now digital,
notes on the keyboard can be assigned to the
sounds. When you play a MIDI synthesizer, and
the MIDI file being used is “bowed violin,” for
example, every note you play will have the
timbre and quality of an individual violin string
being bowed. MIDI is not a straight audio
recording of an instrument — it’s simply the
encoded characteristics of an instrument.

Sound libraries
With many computer programs, such as Apple’s Logic Pro, a variety of sounds
(called sound libraries) are included in the program that allow you to audition
your parts played with simulations or samples of actual orchestral and non-
orchestral instruments. You can try out dozens of ideas with these sounds
and get a general preview of how they will sound when a score is printed and
parts are performed on real instruments. 
One potential drawback of having all of these different instrument sounds at
your disposal is that if you’re writing music that will eventually be played by
real instruments, there is the danger of writing a part that seems easy on
your keyboard or guitar but that your average tuba player or saxophonist
can’t easily, or even possibly, play. The keyboard and guitar are both very
quick instruments on which it’s not a big deal to rapidly play up and down a
wide range of notes for long periods of time. However, when you hand it over
to a saxophonist or a tuba player, you may be greeted with a very angry glare
and a declaration of surrender, simply because you didn’t take into account
that these musicians need to occasionally take a breath. 
When composing on a computer, the sounds provided by the program are
limited in their verisimilitude, owing to the fact that they are not subject to
the physical realities of performance on actual instruments. There are no real
bows bowing, no real breaths taken, no limits of range, and so forth. You can
only get a rough idea at best of what will happen when you get real musicians
to play the parts, unless you compose with these limitations in mind. 
On the other hand, perhaps you don’t want real instruments to ever play your
composition. With a computer, you have an entire orchestra at your fingertips
that likes and respects you and doesn’t get huffy when handed impossible
parts. Thanks to our friend technology, you can invest in massive third-party
libraries of excellent orchestral sound recordings. Some even have elements
such as “bowing” for strings that can be manipulated through MIDI control
and that sound just like the real thing.
These libraries are quite expressive and expensive, but they take up a lot of
hard drive space and require powerful computers to access all their attrib-
utes for a lengthy composition. Many film composers, such as Cliff Martinez
(Solaris, Narc, Traffic) and John Murphy (28 Days Later), exclusively use com-
puters to compose and record music and prefer to do so simply because they
can work on their own schedules and creative whims and don’t have to deal
with any other musicians’ foibles or creative interference. If you know what
you are doing with sound libraries in conjunction with a good music pro-
gram, you can avoid the real orchestra altogether.

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

Composing on Computers
It’s often a good idea to start your computer composition with the rhythm.
Setting a metronome going and establishing a time signature at the beginning
will make editing easier later on, because you will be able to use measures
and beats as timing references for cutting and pasting once your computer
knows where to put the measure lines. Good computer programs allow you
to make changes to tempo and meter later if your composition requires them.
Even if you are starting with just a melody in your head, taking time to set the
correct tempo can be an aid for the creative and technical processes involved.
If you are writing a song or something else that has a strong groove, it is often
a good idea to come up with a little MIDI drum track for two or four measures,
copy it into the whole length of the tune, and use it instead of the boring click
of a metronome. Later you can replace it by re-recording the drums with more
variety — or even re-record it with a real percussionist playing to your origi-
nal groove track.
Thinking in sections
The next thing you can do is to think in two-, four-, or eight-measure phrases
as you add other rhythm section parts (bass, keys, guitar) to your composi-
tion. You don’t have to follow this or any other rule, but most Western music
runs in sections composed of multiples of two or four measures. Thinking in
these terms also makes cutting and pasting easier. 
You can work up all your parts for each section separately. Then you can cut
and paste the entire sections into their proper places within your composi-
tion. You can have a verse, chorus, and bridge, all with multiple instrument
parts in them. The individual parts can be moved around — or you can move
the entire sections. Then you can make changes within each occurrence 
of these parts or sections so that there is some development of your musical
ideas throughout your piece.
Linear composition
Of course, you don’t have to compose by writing sections and copying and
pasting them in. You can always write in a linear fashion. You can play melodies
or even entire performances across the composition in real time. If you are
using MIDI recording instead of recording audio tracks (exception: audio
loops), you can slow the tempo down temporarily just enough so that you
can perform a difficult part that may be beyond your technique as a musician
235
Chapter 18: Composing Electronic Music

at the correct tempo. Then you can set the tempo back to the correct setting
for playback. The nice thing about linear performances with MIDI is that you
can preserve the spontaneity and freshness of a first take, editing out just the
bad notes later.
You can also write the notes into a staff one at a time with mouse clicks or
key commands just as you might do with pencil and paper. You have the
advantage of being able to hear your work back instantly (if not always with
the exact sound you intended).
When working with MIDI, whether or not you plan on printing out a score and
parts, you can always make changes on a note-by-note level, so you never
have to be stuck with a part you don’t like.
Loop composing
There is a growing trend these days to construct compositions using ready-
made phrases of music of varying lengths, styles, and instrumental content.
These phrases are known as loops. Two of the most popular types of loops
are Apple Loops and REX files. 
Loop composition is not new. What is relatively new is the ability to take
recorded audio materials and change the tempo and/or key independently.
For many years now it has been fairly easy to do this with MIDI, but if you
receive a MIDI loop from another musician you still have to attach a sound to
it. MIDI sounds still haven’t quite hit the same nerve that real recordings of
musicians playing real instruments such as a piano or guitar seem to hit.
The problem with audio materials of real instruments is that when you play
them back at a faster or slower tempo, the pitch rises or drops. It sounds
unnatural due to the fact that along with the pitch changing, the other for-
mants of the instrument, such as sound duration, vibrato, attack, and so on,
are being changed as well. This gives the recording an unnaturally eerie or
comical quality when all you wanted was to change the tempo. To create an
audio loop with the ability to change pitch or tempo independently, the audio
file has to be chopped up into small pieces and accordioned out or in, depend-
ing on whether you want the tempo slower or faster, or whether you want the
pitch to shift down or up. Fortunately, that is now pretty easy to do.
You can record a piano phrase of several measures, run it through the Apple
Loops utility to make it into a loop, and then can send it to another person to
use in their next compositional construction. That person can change the
tempo or the key — or both — and paste it in between other complementary
loops. Strictly speaking, this would be more in the nature of assembly than
composition, because you would be using someone else’s musical ideas. 
Of course, if you are making the loops yourself, you are back to the realm of
composition again.
236
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

There is a demand for such loops, and it could become profitable if you can
get hooked up with the right business connections. 
Loops are generally two, four, or eight measures long to make them easier to
use, as most music is constructed in multiples of four measures. You can use
the same loop over and over again throughout your construction, or you can
break up the scenery a little and insert a different loop every so often. You
can also use a different loop every measure if you like. And of course, 
you can have piano loops playing on one track while drum loops are playing
on another and a guitar loop is repeating over and over again on another.
Loops are a bit like a collage of pre-recorded sounds. But keep in mind that
any commercially available loop is going to be available to everyone who
bought the same disc of loops. If you are comfortable with the idea that your
music is an assembly of phrases that are not uniquely your creations, then
loops may be for you. Keep in mind that they can certainly act as an inspira-
tion for your own creativity if you think of them strictly in that way and are
willing to get rid of them after they have performed their inspirational duties.
237
Chapter 18: Composing Electronic Music
Music concrête
Music concrête is a type of music that sprang
directly out of the evolution of music technol-
ogy. In the 1930s, French composer Pierre
Schaeffer began experimenting with splicing
bits of analog tape together to create music
completely different than the source material.
As a throwback to classical music being
inspired by poetic forms, music concrête has its
roots in the 1920s Surrealist literary practice of
cut-up and fold-in composition. In cut-up, writ-
ers would take existing pieces of literature and
rearrange the order of the phrases and words
by cutting up the source material and physically
rearranging it, whereas in fold-in compositions,
a group of writers would write random phrases,
one at a time, on a piece of paper, folding the
paper over after each turn so that the next
writer couldn’t see what the previous writer had
written. 
Music concrête basically means that you are
making music out of existing sounds. This can
range from human voices (as in Steve Reich’s
“It’s Gonna Rain” and “Come Out”), spinning
around on a radio dial (Ben Azarm’s “Neoap-
plictana”), static (Apollon and Muslimgauze’s
“Year Zero”), or a combination of power tools
and bird songs (such as in the music of
Japanese noise rocker Rhizome). A list of sig-
nificant pioneers of the music concrête move-
ment must include Swiss musician Christian
Marclay, whose most notorious composition,
1988’s “Footsteps,” was created by having thou-
sands of people walking across many copies of
the same slab of vinyl and then taking the dam-
aged records and playing them on a turntable,
recording the best bits for an album under the
same title.
Throughout the 1980s, rap artists used the ideas
behind music concrête to completely change
the way contemporary pop musicians would
create music. Through their use of samples
and loops of existing music and dialog, artists
such as Del Tha Funky Homo Sapien and Ice T
brought music concrête from art galleries and
other experimental music forums into the fore-
front of popular music.

When using loops for your music, you will find yourself confronted with almost
limitless choices of which loops to use and where to use them. Loops are
often arranged in categorical file hierarchies. These categories may include
instrument, genre, key, meter, tempo, style, length in measures, and so on.
It is best to try to find a loop that comes close to the key, meter, and tempo
that you have chosen for your composition. Even though you can change all
these things as you see fit, there are limits to how far you can stretch an
audio file and still have it sound decent. On the other hand, experimentation
is often a catalyst for creativity, so if you get lost or bored, try a loop that
doesn’t fit categorically at all with your compositional ideas.
Computer as recorder: 
musical scrapbooking
Another use of the computer in composition is the simple ability of the com-
puter to make basic recordings of your ideas. You don’t always have to think
of the big picture when you are composing. Large compositions start from
small beginnings, and the computer can be there to archive your musical
imagination. 
Keep a folder on your hard drive for your little, inspired noodling sessions.
When you feel like putting your hands on an instrument but have no particu-
lar chords or melody in your head, click Record and just play what comes to
your fingers. Later, if you don’t like any of it, you can delete it, but often you
will land on a good moment or two that you can develop out later. It is useful
to play into the computer using a decent MIDI keyboard, but you can re-
record any ideas that you develop later on the real piano, if you prefer that
sound. Go back to the saved bits in your file folder when you are looking for
ideas to develop.
Create a simple setup for yourself to record so you aren’t bothered with tech-
nical concerns during moments of musical inspiration. Make it easy for you
to just flip a switch or two and begin recording. Don’t let yourself get too
fancy during these noodling sessions. Technology can be a creativity killer,
although it can be a creative process as well under the right circumstances.
The bad news
Well, it’s not exactly bad news, but a warning is warranted here: The com-
puter can never replace your ears or your imagination. Quite often when
using the computer for music you will find yourself getting hooked on the
visual aspect and the quick responsiveness of computers.
238
Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

The fact that computers have provided us with visual tools for musical edit-
ing is wonderful. It lets us look at larger chunks of our work at once. We can
see (not just hear) where our writing has come from and where it is going.
And it provides us with a level of control of even the smallest things beyond
the wildest aspirations of pencil and paper. But the ears on your head (and
inside your head) ought to be the final arbiters of quality when it comes to
music. A piece of music is no shorter or longer than the entire amount of time
it takes to listen to it. Its emotional effect is cumulative. You can’t really judge it
without listening to it from start to finish. Computers can sometimes trick us
into working on bits and pieces and forgetting about the flow of the entire
composition. Be careful!
Saving and backing up
All who have worked extensively with computers have experienced the hollow
feeling in the pits of their stomachs that comes from the realization that much
valuable, hard work has been lost due to computer crashes, forgotten saves,
and the tendency to not back up often enough. A lot of good music has evap-
orated in these ways even as computers advance and our storage methods
and software applications advance. Remember floppy disks? Cassettes? It is
important to remember that the information stored on a computer drive, CD,
or DVD is not actually the thing that it represents. Those bits are not your
composition.
239
Chapter 18: Composing Electronic Music
Andrew Broder, electronic music composer
I don’t know if I’m a great lover of new tech-
nologies. I mean, they’re there, and I’ll use what-
ever’s at my disposal that I happen to think
sounds good. There are some computer pro-
grams that are just like, well, learning quantum
physics. They’re mind-blowingly difficult to
learn. But so is learning how to really immerse
yourself in learning how to play the piano. It’s
just as complicated, and it’s just as much of its
own world, and requires the same kind of facil-
ities in a person, the same kind of dedication,
the same kind of curiosity. But there’s a danger
that your music can become too reliant on new
technology, and the music sometimes can feel
empty when it just becomes a matter of keeping
up with what the latest products are. That said,
though, it’s really cool to be able to make a
whole album on your home computer. 
Everything was new technology at some point.
Reel-to-reel recording was new technology at
one point, same with the electric guitar and the
synthesizer. Those all came along, and people
went through those same kind of debates with
them as to whether or not it was kind of cheating
or somehow more artificial to use than an
acoustic instrument. So, as far as I’m concerned,
what matters is the end result. 

It is critical that you save your work frequently, and back it up by making
copies onto external hard drives and/or hard media such as CDs and DVDs.
In addition, we highly recommend that you make hard copies of everything.
Print out your scores and parts and make recordings of all your work. Through
the course of their careers, many musicians have had to transfer work from
analog tape to VHS Hi-Fi, to DAT, and finally to MP3 audio files and CDs. No
one knows what the next 30 years will bring or how relevant your musical
ideas may be by then, but you need to make it a habit to keep archives of
your work that can be accessed by modern methods.

T
here comes a time in almost every composer’s life when he or she is going
to have to work with other musicians. And while it’s fine to sit and jam
with a couple of guys (or gals), shout chord changes to one another, record
the session, and call the end result a song — it’s entirely another thing to sit
down and write a piece of music that any musicians with some basic music
theory knowledge can read for themselves, without your being there to
explain verbally what you want to hear from them.
The best way to communicate your compositions to others is to write them
down. There are many ways to write music down, and in this chapter we
cover the ones you’re most likely to run into.
Composing with Lead Sheets
The simplest, most basic type of sheet music is called a lead sheet. Lead sheets
are mainly used by pop and jazz musicians — types of music that allow for
individual interpretation of how an instrument’s musical accompaniment
should go. 
A lead sheet is composed of a single staff with the notes of the melody written
out on it, and the accompanying chords written above the staff, as seen in
Figure 19-1. 

Most guitar-centric or popular music magazines publish at least one or two
lead sheets per issue, ones that are usually based on contemporary songs.
There are also stacks and stacks of books that compile many lead sheets,
called fakebooks. The best-known fakebook is called, perhaps confusingly,
The Real Book (Hal Leonard Corporation, currently in its 6th edition). In a
fakebook, you’re provided with a melody line, chord name, a guitar chord
chart showing the proper fingering for each chord to be played, and the
lyrics of the song.
For many cover bands, making their way through a fakebook of modern rock
tunes is about as deep into music theory as they ever get. Or need to get.
Being able to work off a lead sheet or fakebook as a musician can be immensely
satisfying, as they give a musician the room to make up his or her own version
of the song.
Many times, a very basic lead sheet is all a good jazz or pop ensemble needs
to get rolling. A good rule of thumb is that the bass player of the band is the
one with the most detailed sheet music, because, as the fulcrum of the band,
the bass player needs to know exactly when a chord or tempo change is to be
expected. So if you wanted to only write one part for a whole ensemble to
work off of, you would write out a specific bass line, showing the note values
and tempo needed as well as the notes to be played for the bass part.
By writing the chord symbols above the staff on that same lead sheet, you then
provide enough information for the pianist and the guitarist to work from.
Then, because the bass player is playing something very specific and is already
defining the basic rhythm of the piece, the percussionist would be able to use
this same chart to figure out when to play. Instead of needing an individual
rhythm chart, a drummer can look at a bass player’s melodic phrasing and
see where the accents are. Knowing how to put together a good lead sheet
that everyone in the band can use can save you a lot of time. 
Listen to any old jazz or funk record — especially from the catalog of Stax
Records, which represented such performers as Otis Redding and Booker T.
& the MGs during their heyday — and you can hear this musical process
unfold for yourself. They almost all start off with the drums and a bass riff.

Composing with Guitar Tablature
A distinct type of lead sheet, designed specifically for guitar and bass, is called
tablature, or just tab. Instead of using standard musical notation symbols, tab
uses ordinary ASCII numbers and letters, making it ideal for reproducing
music for the Internet and online newsgroups where anybody with any 
computer can link up, copy a tab file, and read it. 
Tablature notation has existed for more than 800 years, with the first known
examples appearing in Asia. Up until the 1600s, the majority of musicians
used tablature to write music for just about every instrument you can think
of, from stringed instruments and horns to early keyboard instruments.
However, tablature had some serious limitations, a major one being that each
piece of it was so instrument-specific that there was no possible way for a
lute player to reproduce a piece of music on a harpsichord, or any other
instrument, by reading his lute tablature. The system began to fall out of
common use when the five-lined staff and modern music notation was stan-
dardized in the 16th century. 
Basically, tab sheets tell you what notes to play. However, there is no way to
tell a musician reading tab exactly how long or short a note needs to be —
the way quarter notes and half notes and so on do — so it may be necessary
for musicians to hear how a piece is to be played before they can success-
fully read any tab you’ve written. There are some cases where note flags are
written above tab characters, but this is not a standard practice and is mostly
confined to tablature written for more archaic instruments like the lute and
the contrabass. 
Tab is very easy to read, though, and many beginning musicians, or musicians
without any real music theory background, prefer to have their music written
for them this way. The basic idea of tab for guitar is that you start out by
drawing six parallel horizontal lines (four for bass), which correspond to the
strings of the instrument. The top line is the highest-pitched string, and the
bottom line is the lowest-pitched. An example is shown in Figure 19-2.

Chapter 19: Composing for Other Musicians

If you’re writing a piece for a bass, you would write out something like 
Figure 19-3.
Next, you write numbers on the lines to show you where to fret the string —
meaning upon which fret to apply pressure (in case there’s any confusion). 
If a zero appears, this means play the open string (no fretting).
The tab shown in Figure 19-4 means play the sequence of notes: E(0), F(1),
F#(2), G(3), G#(4), and A(5) on the bottom E string by moving up a fret at a
time, starting with the open string.
If two or more notes are to be played together, they are written on top of one
another, such as in the example of a G barre chord shown in Figure 19-5. 
In Figure 19-5 you would play all these notes together at once, as a chord.

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

You might see the same chord written out something like Figure 19-6.
Writing tab like Figure 19-6 would mean you want your guitarist to strum the
chord, but more slowly, with each individual string plucked, starting at the
bottom string and ending at the top.
Most modern tablature doesn’t show note values, but as a general rule the
horizontal spacing of the numbers on the tab should tell you which notes are
the long ones, and which are the short and fast ones. As an example, Figure
19-7 shows the first few notes of “The Star-Spangled Banner” in tab. As you
can see, the different spacings correspond to the different note lengths.
To show technical markings in tab, the standard practice is to write extra 
letters or symbols between notes to indicate how to play them, such as the
example in Figure 19-8, which indicates a hammer-on (playing the note by
simply bringing the finger down on the fret, without plucking the note). In
that example you would play the open E twice, then hit the A string at the
fifth fret and hammer on to the seventh fret.

The Score
A piece of music that includes all the notation — precise melodic lines and
harmonic accompaniment — the composer intended for the instrumentalist
to play is called a score. A score can be as simple as the melodic and har-
monic accompaniment of a child’s song for the piano, as in Figure 19-9.
In Figure 19-9, you can see that all the notes the composer intended to be
played by the musician are right there on the paper. There are no chord
charts listed over the staff to suggest improvisation, and there is no mystery
as to how long each note is supposed to be held. Although improvisation might
still be possible, and even welcomed by your audience, there’s no need for it. 
A more advanced score is shown in Figure 19-10.

Chapter 19: Composing for Other Musicians

As you can see, this is a multi-instrumental score, meant for a large ensemble
to play. Generally, the only people who would see this particular score would
be the composer and the conductor of the orchestra. The other members 
of the orchestra would only receive the sheet music for the parts they were
meant to play. Therefore, if you were the second violinist, for this particular
section of music, you would only receive a fragment of the score to read from.
This separation of parts in written scores is why it’s so important for concert
musicians in an orchestral pit to pay attention to the music in front of them,
the music being played around them, and the conductor in front of them. The
performers don’t have the entire instrumental score in front of them, so if
they miss their cue, they might as well pack up their instruments and leave.
Writing for Ensembles
Take a look at the orchestral score in Figure 19-10 again. If you were to play
each instrument’s section straight out on the piano, you might think that
many of the instruments on here are playing completely different notes from
each other. If you got a lot of pianos together and had everyone play the part
of a different instrument from this sheet, you’d end up with a real mess. This
is because many of the instruments used in your standard orchestra are
transposing instruments, meaning that they’re tuned to different keys. (Take 
a look at Chapter 14, on writing for the standard orchestra, for much more
about the specific tunings for these instruments.)
Most composition software automatically helps with the transposition for you
when you’re writing a full score like this one — which makes your Average
Joe Composer’s job a lot easier than it was even 20 years ago. Many software
programs, such as Finale, even ask how many instruments are going to be
used in your composition before you even begin writing, and present you
with as many staffs as needed, as shown in Figure 19-11. 
Many such programs are also equipped with MIDI capabilities, making it possi-
ble to hear all the parts of your composition played out — in tutti, that is, with
all the instruments playing together — before giving it to a live ensemble.
Working with Foreign 
Scores and Ensembles
Many times, especially when working with older scores or with traveling
ensembles, you’ll have a score come across your desk that’s not written in
English — you’ll still be dealing with quarter notes, half notes, and so forth

on the staff itself, but the chords and major and minor keys all have different
names. Because the majority of classical music has been written in non-
English-speaking countries, there’s a good chance this will happen a lot.
This can especially be the case with a multi-instrumental score that changes
key mid-score, where writing one “Sol (G)” in the blank space between staffs
in the middle of the page, right where the key change happens, is quicker
than changing every key signature for every single instrument on every
single staff (such as in many of Tchaikovsky’s orchestral scores). It’s also
handy when reading older folk music scores or working with European folk
music ensembles that use different symbols for their lead sheets. 
Table 19-1 shows a simple chart of note names to help you cross the language
barrier more easily.

Part IV: Orchestration and Arrangement 

As you can see, the French and the Italian note names follow the solfege tra-
dition of the 11th century Roman Catholic Church. Solfege was a system of
note reading invented by Father Guido D’Arezzo for teaching Gregorian chants,
forever immortalized by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music: “Do re mi fa sol
la ti do.”

Ten Composers You 
Should Know About
In This Chapter
 Surveying some of the more extraordinary composers
 Spanning centuries and genres
 Expanding your exposure to giants of music
L
et’s face it: There’s just no way to pick the ten best composers, or ten
most important composers, or even the ten handsomest composers of
all time. Everybody’s got an opinion on what makes a composer great, and if
you go to the library or bookstore looking for books about composers, you’ll
be faced with a daunting wall of personal opinion on this matter. 
Taking this into consideration, what we’ve tried to do here is pick ten extraor-
dinary composers who challenged musical conventions and public perception
of what music is supposed to be — just ten out of dozens of pioneers in the
world of music.
Claudio Monteverdi, 1567–1643
If you had to name one person who was the “missing link” between the music
of the Renaissance and the Baroque periods, it would be Claudio Monteverdi.
Monteverdi brought an unparalleled level of sophistication and respect to
vocal music, turning it from something only peasants and priests could enjoy
into full-blown opera performances designed to entertain the ruling and intel-
lectual elite. 
Even as a child, Monteverdi was musically precocious. His first publication of
sheet music was issued by a prominent Venetian publishing house when he
was only 15, and by the time he was 20 a variety of his works had gone to print.
His first book of five-voice madrigals succeeded in establishing his reputation
outside of his provincial hometown and helped him find work in the court of
the Duke Gonzaga of Mantua. 

Monteverdi became known as a leading advocate of the then radical approach
to harmony and text expression. In 1613, Monteverdi was appointed maestro
di cappella at St. Mark’s, Venice. There, Monteverdi was active in reorganizing
and improving vocal music, specifically a capella, as well as writing music for
it. He was also in huge demand outside of the Church for his operas and
made a decent living from opera commissions. 
Monteverdi can be justly considered one of the most influential figures in the
evolution of modern music. His opera, Orfeo, was the first to reveal the poten-
tial of the genre, while his follow-up, Arianna, may be responsible for the sur-
vival of opera into the 18th century and beyond. Monteverdi’s final opera,
L_incoronazione di Poppea, is his greatest masterpiece and arguably the finest
opera of the 17th century. Monteverdi was also one of the first composers to
utilize the techniques of tremolo and pizzicato on stringed instruments.
In his collections of sacred music, Monteverdi displayed his knowledge and
mastery of other musical genres as well. His masses are a monument to the
old style, whereas his motets, written for virtuoso singers, are the most thor-
oughgoing exhibition of the modern style and the seconda prattica. His most
important contribution to secular and vocal music, however, is that he intro-
duced a more intensely expressive and dramatic element into music than had
previously been felt. Today he is regarded less as a revolutionary than as one
of the outstanding composers of his time, who combined the old with the new
to forge a style of music with a dramatic range, emotional expression, and
sensuous lyricism that had never been heard before.
Charles Ives, 1874–1954
American composer Charles Ives was an experimental and boldly original
pioneer in musical expression. Without him, the brilliance of the American
experimental music scene in the 1930s would have been delayed by years, 
or perhaps never even happened. Recognition of his forceful, often eccentric
genius came late in his life and much more fully after his death. 
In a way, Charles Ives really lived two lives: an outward, tradition-bound public
life as a very successful executive at Mutual Life Insurance, and an inward
reflective life full of paradoxical and revolutionary musical ideas. By being
gainfully employed in insurance — and he bordered on being a millionaire
due to his brilliant ideas regarding estate planning — Ives found he didn’t
need to rely on his music to bring in any money and could therefore write
and record his music according to how he wanted, and not how any per-
ceived audience wanted. 
The musical environment in late 19th-century America, when Ives began com-
posing, was conservative, cold, and retrogressive and was still attached to the
nearly exhausted European Romantic tradition. Though he sometimes wrote
traditional pieces, Ives mostly experimented with new musical procedures. 
256
Part V: The Part of Tens 

By the 1920s, Ives had experimented with practically every important musical
innovation that would still be considered new music 50 years later, including
atonality, bitonality, polymetric patterns, polyharmonic and polytonal partic-
ulars, quarter tones, microtones, tone clusters, and tone rows. Realizing that
his music was too unconventional for most people to enjoy, he composed pri-
marily for his own pleasure and, except for works for organ and church choirs,
most of his compositions remained unperformed for years.
During most of his life, Ives was treated simply as a musical eccentric.
Fortunately, he lived just long enough to see his work begin to be accepted.
His Symphony No. 3 (The Camp Meeting) won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947. In all,
Ives wrote a staggeringly large amount of music: four symphonies, numerous
large and small orchestral and chamber works, two finger-breaking, sprawling
piano sonatas, four violin sonatas, many choral pieces, short solo piano, and
organ works, and nearly 200 songs.
Béla Bartók, 1881–1945
Béla Bartók was another very important figure in 20th-century music. The
Hungarian-born composer and pianist’s most lasting contribution to music is
his incorporation of Hungarian folk music into his compositions. Not only is he
considered one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, but he was also
one of the founders of the field of ethnomusicology, or the study and ethnog-
raphy of folk music. As a composer, Bartók was an influential modernist, who
used such revolutionary techniques as atonality, bitonality, polymodal chro-
maticism, octonal scales, diatonic and heptatonic second and seven-note
scales, whole-tone scales, and many other principles outside the realm of
what was then considered musically acceptable. 
The defining event of Bartók’s musical life occurred in 1905, when he and
fellow Hungarian composer Zoltan Kodály journeyed into remote rural areas
of Hungary to collect the peasant songs of the Magyar, an ancient semi-
nomadic people that had lived in the region for possibly thousands of years.
The melodies and rhythms of Magyarok folk music incorporated scale and
rhythmic patterns that lay completely outside the traditions of 19th century
Western music. Ironically, these scales and rhythms were a lot like the ones
being “invented” and explored by early 20th-century modernists such as
French composers Clause Debussy and Maurice Ravel. 
Before Bartók and Kodály’s examination of the Magyars’ music, most people
had considered Magyarok folk music to be Gypsy music. In actuality, the old
Magyarok folk melodies discovered by Bartók and Kodály were almost all
based on pentatonic scales similar to those found in various Oriental folk 
traditions, notably those of Central Asia and Siberia. 
257
Chapter 20: Ten Composers You Should Know About

From 1905 on, Bartók considered the documentation of rural folk music his
true calling in life. He recorded thousands of examples from Bulgaria, Hungary,
Romania, Turkey, and other areas. Eventually he wrote down a vast amount
of this material in musical notation, organized it systematically, and analyzed
and wrote about it. This contribution to the developing discipline of ethno-
musicology ranks among Bartók’s most important achievements. 
For Bartók the composer, the discovery of peasant music had a liberating
influence. Bartók based some of his compositions directly on the music he
collected, as in the Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs for solo piano.
But more commonly, he composed his own material in a style that reflected
his absorption of the melodic and rhythmic aspects of the folk music he stud-
ied, but still retained many of the classical elements of mainstream classical
music.
Among Bartók’s important works are his Mikrokosmos (1926, 1932–1939),
which consists of 153 piano pieces in six books of increasing difficulty.
Ranging from basic five-finger exercises to the virtuosity of “Six Dances in
Bulgarian Rhythm,” Mikrokosmos is both a unique 20th-century teaching
method for piano and a thorough introduction to Bartók’s compositional
style. Other major works include six string quartets, the one-act opera
Bluebeard’s Castle, Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, and Sonata for
Two Pianos and Percussion.
Igor Stravinsky, 1882–1971
Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky was a Russian-born composer who spent most of
his musical career challenging established musical conventions. His composi-
tions were technically challenging enough that no critics could dare fault him
for writing “easy” music, yet engaging enough thematically that they couldn’t
just dismiss him as obsessed with technique and random experimentation. 
His most famous composition, 1913’s Rite of Spring, was so radical in its overt
sexuality both musically and choreographically that the Parisian audience
rioted violently in the theater during its opening performance, with some
attendees even taking the mayhem into the streets outside. The protests were
so loud, in fact, that the dancers on stage had trouble hearing the orchestra
playing. It wasn’t very long before the composition was heralded as genius,
and subsequent performances were both well attended and well received. 
Stravinsky’s initially disturbing yet wildly popular compositions, which
included The Rite of Spring, Fireworks, and Firebird, all drew heavily from the
Russian folk music of the “common” people — music that before had been
considered inferior for concert performances. Another defining feature of
Stravinsky’s larger pieces is that he made no attempt to link the movements
of his compositions in a harmonious way. Instead, he made a clean break
258
Part V: The Part of Tens 

from one movement to the next, almost as though he was presenting an
entirely different song. These lurches from one symphonic movement to the
next were incredibly disorienting to 19th-century audiences, who were used
to being gently and harmoniously led through a composition from the begin-
ning to the end.
The binding energy of his orchestral compositions is much more rhythmic
than harmonic, and the driving pulsations of The Rite of Spring marked a 
crucial change in the nature of Western music. Stravinsky, however, left it 
to others to use that change, for after completing his Chinese opera The
Nightingale, he turned aside from writing large orchestral pieces to concen-
trate on small chamber orchestra music and piano compositions. 
Aaron Copland, 1900–1990
If ever a classical composer could be said to have defined the sound of
“American” music, Aaron Copland has to be at the top of the list. His music
was the aural equivalent of the movie western: big, bold, short on subtlety
and long on orchestral exclamation points. He was a true pioneer of American
music and showed the world how to write classical music in an American
way. He was an American composer in a time when Americans were rarely
recognized as composers in the music world.
Although his earliest work was heavily influenced by the French impression-
ists, he soon began to develop a personalized style. After experimenting with
jazz rhythms in such works as Music for the Theater (1925) and the Piano
Concerto (1927), Copland turned to more austere and dissonant composi-
tions. Concert pieces such as the Piano Variations (1930) and Statements
(1933-1935) rely on nervous, irregular rhythms, angular melodies, and highly
dissonant harmonies.
Copland’s immense output of Americana-inspired classical music, such as
Fanfare for the Common Man, Rodeo, Billy the Kid, Appalachian Spring, The
Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson, and El Salon Mexico showed other American
composers that they didn’t have to pretend to be European to be taken seri-
ously. Like many composers of his time, he drew heavily on the folk music of
his country, bringing the sound of the Old West into the classical arena. Many
of his compositions, especially Billy the Kid, Fanfare for the Common Man, 
and Appalachian Spring, have been used in many movie westerns and, most
recently, parodies of movie westerns. You might think you don’t know
Copland, but you’d have to have been living under a rock for the past 40 years
to have completely missed his music. 
Copland’s work had (and still has) a universal appeal that seemed to fit into
anything American. His compositions Hoe-Down and Fanfare for the Common
Man were reworked in the 1970s by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In the 1990s, the
259
Chapter 20: Ten Composers You Should Know About

National Cattlemen’s Beef Association used Hoe-Down as the background
music to their marketing campaign, “Beef ... it’s what’s for dinner.” This piece
was also used during the 78th Academy Awards. Hoe-Down resurfaced once
again in Spike Lee’s film He Got Game, where it played in the background of a
neighborhood basketball game. It’s difficult to overestimate the influence
Copland has had on film music. Virtually every composer who scored for
western movies, particularly between 1940 and 1960, was shaped by the style
Copland developed. 
Raymond Scott, 1909–1994
If you’ve ever watched a Looney Tunes cartoon, or really any cartoon in the
Warner Bros. catalog, you’ve heard the music of Raymond Scott, a.k.a. Harry
Warnow. Ironically, Scott never consciously wrote any music for cartoons,
and, according to his wife, never even watched cartoons. Scott simply sold
the rights to a huge chunk of his music to Warner Brothers in the 1940s, and
the rest is animation history. Carl Stalling, music director for Warner’s Looney
Tunes and Merrie Melodies, was allowed to adapt anything in the Warner
music catalog, and he immediately began making liberal use of Scott’s scores.
Scott’s music scored more than 120 Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck animated
shorts, while today The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, Animaniacs, The Oblongs,
Batfink, and Duckman are just a few of the cartoon series that regularly use
Scott’s music. His best-known composition, “Powerhouse,” was used ten
times in 2003’s full-length feature movie, Looney Tunes: Back in Action.
To the casual observer, it might seem like Scott had given the best work of
his life away, but Scott was involved in so many other music projects it prob-
ably felt like getting a lot of money for nothing. Almost immediately after
graduating from Julliard in 1931, Scott had been working as a professional
musician, with the support of his older brother, Mark Warnow, who was the
musical director for the very popular radio show Your Hit Parade. While still
in his early 20s, Scott became the pianist for the CBS Radio house band, where
he met the members of his first band, the Raymond Scott Quintette. Coming
from a classical background, Scott disliked the popular jazz tradition of
improvisation, but also disliked the concept of sheet music, believing that
good music would just stick in the heads of the musicians involved without
need to write it down. He wrote nothing down on paper, insisting that the
other members of his group follow lead lines often hummed at them from
behind the piano. 
The Quintette existed from 1937 to 1939 and sold millions of records, despite
being labeled a novelty jazz band. When Scott was appointed music director
of CBS radio in 1942, he made history by breaking the color barrier by orga-
nizing the first racially integrated radio band, which included saxophonist
Ben Webster and trumpeter Charlie Shavers. 
260
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Far from being simply a musician and bandleader, however, Scott was also
heavily involved in music technology. As far back as the 1940s, Raymond
Scott had a home recording studio, where he would cut and splice reels of his
band’s rehearsal sessions to find the best parts of the music. In 1946, Scott
started his own company, Manhattan Research, Inc., which he announced
would “design and manufacture electronic music devices and systems.” Dr.
Robert Moog worked for Scott for a short time before starting his own com-
pany up and claimed he was a huge influence on his own direction in music.
At Manhattan Research, Inc., Scott invented the the Electronium, which was
one of the first synthesizers ever created; the Karloff, an early sampler capa-
ble of recreating sounds ranging from sizzling steaks to jungle drums; and the
Videola, which fused together a keyboard and a TV screen to aid in compos-
ing music for films and other moving images. 
Raymond Scott continued to write and record music during this period,
releasing records of electronic ambient music well before Philip Glass and
Terry Riley, and in 1971, he was hired as director of Motown’s electronic
music and research department — and was kept there for many years just in
case the future of music really was “electronic.” He continued to compose
and invent electronic instruments until his death in 1994.
Leonard Bernstein, 1918–1990
Leonard Bernstein was an American composer, conductor, and pianist who
wrote music that can only be described as exuberant. Just about every single
piece of music he wrote was incredibly uplifting, irresistibly happy, and full of
energy — much as Bernstein himself physically appeared when taking the
reins as conductor, both at the New York Philharmonic and elsewhere. His
success as a composer for both Broadway and the orchestra helped forge a
new relationship between classical and popular music. His guiding principle
was that music could and should play a vital role in the lives of all people, 
not just academics. In 1967, he wrote, “Life without music is unthinkable,
music without life is academic. That is why my contact with music is a total
embrace.”
Bernstein’s limitless energy and virtuosity were legend in New York in the
1940s, where he seemed to be everywhere at once. In 1944, he collaborated
with his friend, the dancer and choreographer Jerome Robbins, on a new
ballet entitled Fancy Free. The acclaim that greeted Fancy Free convinced
Robbins and Bernstein that the ballet contained the seeds of a full-fledged
Broadway musical. With their friends Betty Comden and Adolph Green, they
quickly created On the Town (1944), which became their first Broadway hit.
At the same time, he began building a conventional conducting career, with
the advice and counsel of such mentors as Koussevitzky, Artur Rodzinski,
261
Chapter 20: Ten Composers You Should Know About

and Dimitri Mitropoulos, virtually reinventing the role of the serious American
composer, freely moving between Broadway and the concert hall. With
Comden and Green and their friend Judy Holliday, he performed in night-
clubs as part of The Revuers. The night before his impromptu New York
Philharmonic debut, mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel, at her Town Hall debut
recital, gave the first performance in New York of Bernstein’s “I Hate Music.”
Bernstein seemed comfortable writing in any form he chose. His composition
included three symphonies, including a tribute to his Jewish heritage,
Symphony No. 1: Jeremiah, to the musicals On the Town, Wonderful Town, and
West Side Story. He also composed the operetta Candide; the operas Trouble
in Tahiti and A Quiet Place; Chichester Psalms for chorus and orchestra; the
ballets Fancy Free and The Dybbuk Variations; Mass, for “singers, dancers, 
and players”; and the song cycle Arias and Barcarolles (1989). 
Arvo Pärt, 1935–present
Arvo Pärt is one of those composers lumped under the term minimalism that
doesn’t really belong there. There has to be a better way to describe his music,
however, because instead of simply condensing a piece of music to its bare
tonal center, Pärt is just somehow able to find the very best couple of notes
for his compositions. His composition process is legendary, with reports of
him sitting at the piano for hours and hours on end, hitting the same key 
over and over, trying to find the perfect way to sound that one note. 
Far from resulting in tedious, mechanical-sounding music, Pärt’s music is so
pure and perfect that many have dubbed his work sacred minimalism. Pärt,
who received his musical training almost equally within the Catholic Church
and in music school, draws heavily on the tradition of Gregorian chant in his
vocal works, applying the same principal of using only the absolute best
notes for both the instruments and the voices used in his compositions.
Throughout Pärt’s career, he has demonstrated a voracious musical curiosity
and daring experimental spirit that has allowed him to become not only
Estonia’s premiere composer, but one of the best-known choral and sacred
music composers of the 21st century. Thirty years of musical experimenta-
tion with influences as wide ranging as Russian neoclassicism, Western mod-
ernism, Schoenbergian dodecaphony, minimalism, polytonality, Gregorian
chant, and collage have led him to a style of music he calls “tintinnabulation,”
also called “sacred minimalism” by colleague Steve Reich. This method,
which takes its name from the Latin word for bells, places unusual emphasis
on individual notes and makes extensive use of silence.
262
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Steve Reich, 1936–present
Steve Reich could easily be considered the father of all industrial music, and
his influence can be felt in the music of bands as wide ranging as Einstürzende
Neubauten to Nine Inch Nails. Way back in the 1960s, Reich was using tape
loops of people speaking as rhythmic devices in his compositions, created at
the San Francisco Tape Music Center. These tape pieces, such as “It’s Gonna
Rain” (1965) and “Come Out” (1966), are the earliest examples of phasing, 
one of Reich’s most used and most well known techniques. In phasing, 
two tape loops are set into motion at two slightly different speeds, so that 
the tapes begin in unison and slowly shift out of phase, creating a new set of
harmonies and rhythms. It’s like music concrète, or “found” music, but taken
one step further, creating controlled and fully realized compositions out of
random chaos. 
This process was later incorporated into several pieces for traditional acoustic
instruments (or instruments and tape), such as in “Piano Phase” and “Violin
Phase.” In addition to the initial process of phasing, Reich also introduces
into “Violin Phase” the notion of “found” or “resulting” patterns (new melodic
figures created from the overlapping voices of the original “theme”). In 1970,
Reich set out on an intensive study of Ghanaian drumming, which is the tribal
drumming of the indigenous peoples of Bali in which a single “song” can last
all day long. His highly influential percussive recording, “Drumming,” came
directly out of this experience. This piece is an enormous, hour-long elabora-
tion of a single rhythmic cell, developed and re-orchestrated through four 
distinct sections. 
Reich’s 1988 piece, the Grammy award-winning “Different Trains,” marked a
new compositional method in which speech recordings were used as the per-
cussive instrument and accompanied by a live string quartet. In this piece,
Reich compared and contrasted his childhood memories of his train journeys
between New York and California in 1939-1941 with the very different trains
being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths
under Nazi rule.
Eric Whitacre, 1970–present
While many of the composers on this list have made their mark because 
they wrote music that broke through the musical conventions of the day, 
Eric Whitacre had been making waves by digging deep into the history of
Western music and revitalizing the relatively ancient genres of a capella
music and polyphonic chant. His compositions draw their lyrical inspiration
263
Chapter 20: Ten Composers You Should Know About

from many of the most important poets of the past century, such as Octavio
Paz, e. e. cummings, Edmund Waller, and Emily Dickinson, and imbued those
words with the spiritual beauty of a capella Gregorian chant. 
Many of Whitacre’s works have entered the standard choral and symphonic
repertoires and have become the subject of several recent scholarly works
and doctoral dissertations. His works Water Night, Cloudburst, Sleep, Lux
Aurumque, and A Boy and a Girl are among the most popular choral works of
the last decade. One major aspect of Whitacre’s compositions is that he
builds complex chords using the human voice. The challenge of playing his
music is that everything has to be sung perfectly in tune, without vibrato or
any vocal affectation, or the sophisticated chords won’t work. 
Whitacre has received composition awards from the Barlow International
Composition Competition, the American Choral Directors Association, and
the American Composers Forum. In 2001, he became the youngest recipient
ever awarded the coveted Raymond C. Brock commission by the American
Choral Directors Association. Whitacre’s chorale music has even inspired the
creation of a number of national and international music festivals specifically
for chorale and wind instruments. Australia now hosts an annual Eric Whitacre
Wind Symphony Festival, while in Italy, both Venice and Florence hold a
Venice Whitacre Festival. 
264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Steve Reich, composer
Minimalism is a term used by journalists and
music historians, and it’s fine for them, but use
a word like that for one of my compositions, to
me, and I’ll tell you to go to the bathroom and
wash out your mouth. What would happen if you
or I went to Paris and dug up Claude Debussy,
and said, ‘Excuse me, Monsieur, are you an
Impressionist?’ He would said, ‘No!’ and go right
back to sleep. Because these are terms taken
from painting and sculpture, and applied by
journalists and historians to musicians. To musi-
cians, these terms mean absolutely nothing. 
It’s just a short-hand way of lumping types of
musicians together into a movement or scene
that doesn’t exist.

Nine Career Opportunities 
for Composers

You don’t need a book to tell you that making a living as a composer is
hard. And it’s not because the money isn’t out there waiting for you to
come along. It’s simply because that for every legitimate composing job out
there, there are dozens — or even hundreds — of budding, starry-eyed com-
posers out there, waiting in line for their big chance.
Does that mean you should give up? No, it means that what’s going to set you
apart from every other composer out there — besides your massive talent —
is your ability to persevere against what might seem like tremendous odds.
That, and the ability to seek out work on your own and not sit around and
wait for want ads in the paper or the music journals to pop up.
The following careers are just a few of the opportunities open to composers
that may not have crossed your — or your competition’s — mind. 
School Bands and Choirs
Every year, high schools and colleges across the country put on musical per-
formances for both parent and community audiences. Sometimes, the music
used for these performances comes from well-known sources, such as

Oklahoma! or Grease. Sometimes, though, the school in question wants to
use completely original music, preferably written by a local composer. It’s 
an extra bonus if that composer once attended that school. 
The best way to get your foot in the door as a composer at your local high
school or college is to approach the music department head in person with 
a selection of your own original music. Call up the school in question, set up
an appointment, and then come prepared. You’ll want to bring a portfolio of
your original written music to present at the appointment, plus a recording of
it for the music director to listen to at his or her leisure.
Granted, most high schools and universities don’t have a huge budget for
paying composers for original work, but having this credit under your belt
may open doors you can’t currently imagine. Your name will be on the
printed program of the performance, and every single person attending the
performance will receive a copy of this program. If the performance is a suc-
cess, there’s a chance that schools outside of your community will want to
use your music.
The trick to writing music for either a high school/college choir or musical is
that you have to take into consideration that you’re writing for kids. Talented
kids, probably, but still kids. Therefore, you want to keep the instrumentation
and vocals just easy enough for them to handle, but challenging enough for
them to feel like they’ve accomplished something. Think somewhere between
Andrew Lloyd Weber’s Phantom of the Opera and the music from The Muppet
Show.
Make sure you copyright any work that is accepted for use in a performance.
A “poor man’s copyright” should do for this purpose — simply fold your
score into thirds, staple it closed (don’t put it in an envelope), then mail it to
yourself. If you do put it in an envelope, send it Certified Mail, Return Receipt
Requested. The post office’s dated postal mark on an unopened copy of the
score, or your signature for delivery, will hold up in most preliminary court
settings in case of copyright infringement. (For information on making a more
secure copyright, see the sidebar “Copyrighting your work” in Chapter 17.)
Incidental Television Music
Spend any amount of time in front of a television set, and you’ll be amazed at
how much incidental filler music is used on any given program. There’s music
to accompany car chases, love scenes, deep or funny or confusing or danger-
ous or poignant moments, and so on. Even your local news programs proba-
bly use little musical segments at the beginning and end of the shows.
266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

For major network shows, you’re going to need a good, persistent agent and 
a whole lot of experience behind you to get your music in those action/love/
flashback scenes. However, the world of cable TV is a whole lot more
approachable to the beginning or mid-level composer. Your locally produced
cable or public-access stations are good places to start. Their budget is likely
to be small or nonexistent, so you’re probably going to have to do a lot of
free work right off the bat — but people do watch these shows, and this is a
credit you can put on your résumé.
Scout out programs that you personally think are interesting or show great
promise and then call up the station and find out when those shows are
taped. You can then either show up in person on the day of the taping and try
to hand your demo CD to the hosts or actors of the show in person, or leave
a phone message and a copy of the CD in the program’s station mailbox.
Make sure you call back to confirm that they received the CD and to see if
you can set up an appointment with the people in charge of the program’s
music. Don’t be a pest, but be persistent. If you don’t hear anything back
within a reasonable frame of time, brush the dust off your jeans and go 
knock on another door.
Local news programs are another place to try and place your music. Call
ahead of time and try to get an appointment with the music director. If an in-
person interview isn’t possible, try mailing a copy of your CD and a résumé
to the director. Always include your contact info (address, phone number,
email address) and follow up with a phone call about a week after sending
the demo. 
Musical Theater 
Musical theater is another area where your mastery of music composition can
be utilized. Generally, the composer writes the music, and a lyricist writes the
words, although it’s not unusual for one person to act as both composer and
lyricist. In most cases, composers leave the dances or underscoring to the
orchestrator and dance arranger. Only a very few people have succeeded as
both composer and lyricist as successfully as Noel Coward, Robert Meredith
Wilson, or Jonathan Larson. If you can find a good lyricist to partner up with
early in the game, you can save yourself a lot of hassle. 
Most show tunes are written on an AABA structure, with a verse and a chorus/
refrain. The verse (A) sets up the premise of a song and helps move the story
of the musical along, and the chorus (B) states the main idea. For example,
consider the title song to Oklahoma!, where the verse begins “They couldn’t
pick a better time to start in life,” and says how happy the leads will be living
in a “brand new state.” The chorus starts with a joyous shout of “Ooooo-
klahoma,” and then sings the praises of that territory. 
267
Chapter 21: Nine Career Opportunities for Composers

Broken down very simply, there are three basic types of show tunes used in
musicals:
 “I Am” songs
 “I Want” songs
 “New” songs
“I Am” songs explain a character, a group of characters, or a situation. “I
Want” songs tell us what characters desire — what motivates them. Most
love songs fit into this category. “New” songs include any songs that don’t 
fit the other two categories, such as instrumentals. “New” songs are there
because they serve special dramatic needs, such as the dialog-free big fight
scene in West Side Story, set to “the rumble” ballet. 
The chances that you’re going to have your music performed on Broadway
right out of the gate are slim to none. So once again, this is a good time for
you to check out the musical theater offerings in your own neck of the woods
and see if you can get hired writing music for local productions. Dinner 
theaters that feature live musical entertainment sometimes hire one or two
composers or musical directors to work with all of their productions. 
When you do land yourself a gig, any gig, put in your own fair share in getting
the word out about the production. Send press releases to newspapers and
local critics. If any good reviews of the production go to print, especially if they
mention you by name or your music, photocopy them many, many times and
include a copy of the positive review with any future résumés you send out. 
Concert Composition and Performances
Any pop musician will tell you that the big money in music is in playing con-
certs. This is why some bands and artists are always on the road. It applies to
classical performers as well. Sure, some people will buy a major label classi-
cal recording to listen to in the car, but the real cash comes from ticket sales
at concert halls.
Your best bet for booking a performance at a club is to talk to the club’s book-
ing agent. Or hire a tour manager to set up performances for you on a national
or international basis. If you’re just planning on playing small, independently
run venues on the local level or on tour, you probably don’t need a manager,
and a little bit of Internet and phone book research can give you the names of
hundreds of clubs that would love to have you stop by and play for free, or for
popcorn and beer, or for a percentage of ticket sales. You also usually get a
table to sell your CDs (and T-shirts) before and after the performance. A good
tour manger also has the connections necessary to book you at larger venues
where money up front, a guaranteed rate, or a substantial percentage of ticket
sales are part of the deal. 
268
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you’re not comfortable performing in front of people, but you have lots of
music that is performance-ready, you can get that music performed by selling
or even lending out your performances on a profit-sharing basis to a local
classical ensemble to perform at events. Unless you’re composing for an
ensemble as big as the Kronos Quartet, you’re not going to make a whole 
lot of money this way, but you can get your name out for people to see, and
it’s one more credit to put on the ol’ résumé. 
Producer/Arranger
Just about every rap star and electronic music performer has had a “producer”
credit at one time or another. Ask them what they did as “producer” on the
record, however, and they may give you a blank look. “Why, I produced! What
kind of question is that?”
The truth is, being a producer can range from singing backing vocals on a of
couple tracks to really giving a record a complete overhaul with a patient and
guiding hand. If you’re very famous, then the first example is probably the
extent of your production work. You’re attaching your very famous name to 
a lesser-known person’s name, and hopefully attracting your fans to this
person’s record (and vice versa). 
Real producers are people like Genya Raven and Steve Albini (who prefers to
call himself a studio engineer instead of producer). They go into the studio
with the band and help tweak their sound and make it more marketable, or
just better. A good producer can call up other musicians in the trade, like
horn or steel pedal or xylophone players, to fill in what they think are missing
parts of the existing music. 
As a composer and overall expert in music, you can make a huge difference in
the evolution of a band by working in the producer capacity. Start with small,
local bands first, and if it seems like this is something you are very good at,
the word of mouth and studio association will start bringing the clients in.
There are lots more bands out there than there are producers (especially
good producers). A good producer is never short on steady employment.
Don’t be afraid to start at the bottom. Many producers need assistants, and
this is a good way to gain experience and get your foot in the door if a pro-
ducing position opens up.
Knowing how to write arrangements is another side of being a good 
producer — it’s also a good career in itself. An arranger can take a piece of
music written for one instrument, or multiple instruments, and make it better
suited for another instrument or another set of instruments entirely. A famil-
iarity with instruments’ physical and tonal capabilities and excellent, second-
nature transposition abilities are essential to being an arranger.

Chapter 21: Nine Career Opportunities for Composers

Industrial Music and Advertising
Industrial music — not the dance music, but the music of the working world —
is any music that is used for a specific, usually commercial, purpose.
Advertising music (jingles), convention music, and music written for music
libraries all fall under this category. 
The best way to break into advertising as a new composer is to actively go
out and seek local businesses and find out if they need music for any televi-
sion or radio campaigns. Local bars are a great place to start, because they
almost always use music in their advertising — an extra bonus for them (and
you) would be for you or your band to perform at the bar in question. Local
clothing and shoe stores are also good places to try, as they also use music 
in their advertising and are always trying to find a new way to sound “fresh”
and “cutting-edge.” 
Business conventions
If there’s going to be a big business convention in your town, find out if any
local businesses are going to have a booth at the event. Many times, the most
stodgy-seeming company, such as medical suppliers or stationery stores, will
hire a musician or a small band to play music at their booth in order to attract
attention away from their competitors. As with any potential job, call ahead
to set up an appointment — or at the least, try to find out who is in charge of
setting up the convention booth for the company. Mail a copy of your demo
disc to that person and follow up after the appropriate length of time (one
week is usually good).
Music libraries 
Music libraries, or song banks, can range from a single CD with one composer’s
interpretation of public domain scores (musical copyright expires 70 years
from the composer’s death and becomes “public domain”) to Web sites that
sell thousands of sound effects to full-length compositions from any number
of musicians and composers. Many of the Web-based music libraries, such as
Audiosparx (www.audiosparx.com), are always open to working with more
musicians, and will pay you 50 percent of whatever they earn from people
downloading your sound effects or music. Plenty of musicians make a small
but steady income working with music libraries, which then sell music and
sounds to video game companies, independent film companies, and even
phone companies (for ringtones).

Film Scoring
One of the most lucrative careers that a music composer can pursue is writ-
ing scores for films. It’s a very difficult arena to get into, though, and if you’re
not able to stomach competition or rejection, it’s probably not for you. If you
do get your moment in the sun, however, just remember that your score has
to fit the film, it has to be evocative emotionally, and you absolutely have to
be able to stick to all deadlines and timetables thrown at you, no matter how
impossible they seem. See Chapter 17 on more about being a film composer. 
Video Game Scoring
Video game scoring is another very lucrative career for composers, and also
one of the most challenging. You have to have an intimate knowledge of every
game you’re scoring for, including the sounds needed for every possible sce-
nario in the game. Most video games are wall-to-wall sounds, all the way
through, and therefore require a composer to write a lot of music. An inti-
mate knowledge of how rhythm and changing tempos affects mood is neces-
sary, as is the ability to compose both highly unpleasant, discordant music
and triumphant-sounding music to fit scenes on a very tight deadline. There
is more about video game scoring in Chapter 17.
Songwriting
Another good career for composers is that of a songwriter. Many big-name
pop stars depend on songwriters to come up with lyrics for them, and if you
can get your foot in the door in this highly competitive field, you’ll have no
trouble finding money to fund your own pet projects. 
A good place to start finding leads is the book Songwriter’s Market (Ian Bessler,
Writer’s Digest Books). Songwriter’s Market lists hundreds of agencies, record
labels, publishing companies, and production companies looking for songwrit-
ers to work with, as well as pay rates and basic contract information.

W
alk into any bookstore and check out the Music Books section, and
you’ll find yourself before a wall of daunting choices. Stop by any
given online bookstore and search for music, and you’ll be faced with even
more. It seems there are nearly as many books written about music composi-
tion, the music business, and music appreciation as there are albums or 
compact discs containing music.
Here are just a few of the good ones. 
Songwriter’s Market
by Ian Bessler, Writer’s Digest Books
Songwriter’s Market is one of the most respected of the market guides and
worth picking up every year when a new edition comes out (the 2008 edition
is the latest as of this writing). For more than 30 years, the guide has provided
up-to-date contact information on music-publishing houses, record compa-
nies, managers, booking agents, and record producers. It also explains what
sorts of musicians and composers these organizations want to work with for
the coming year. Besides that, the book lists how much money you can expect

to be paid for projects from each record label and music publisher mentioned.
There’s also lots of information on composing and songwriting contests, as
well as information on networking groups and unions that are beneficial for
composers and musicians. 
Plus the book has a huge, easy-to-understand section on the business side of
being a composer or songwriter, including how to read contracts or even
write your own basic contract, what sorts of fees are acceptable when sign-
ing with a manager or agent, and advice on copyrighting your material. There
are also about a dozen interviews in each edition with professional composers
and songwriters on how they found success in their given field.
The Shaping of Musical Elements, Vol. II
by Armand Russell and Allen Trubitt, Schirmer Books/Macmillan, Inc.
If you’ve taken a beginning theory class in college, you may have read or heard
of this series. Where the first volume introduced many of the basic principals
of music theory, form, and analysis, Vol. II concerns itself with the historical
development of music since the 17th century. Baroque, Classical, and Romantic
era music is analyzed and dissected to its minutest parts, with good and
detailed explanations of what each composer was either trying to do with his
music or what his music inspired the next generation of composers to do.
The book progresses into the 20th century, with analytical stops at every
point in musical history. 
It’s a really ambitious (and pricey) book — we feel particularly sorry for any
student expected to cover all this heady material in one year at music school,
even with the benefit of a professor close at hand. You could spend years
familiarizing yourself with the concepts and techniques discussed in this
book and have a lot of fun doing it, too.
The Norton Scores, Vols. 1 
and 2, 10th Edition
edited by Kristine Forney, W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.
These books are an absolute must for anyone interested in seriously dissect-
ing classical music. Vol. 1 contains full orchestral scores from the early secu-
lar period to Renaissance, Baroque, and Classic periods of music, including
works of Beethoven, Bach, Scarlatti, Haydn, and more than a dozen other
composers. Vol. 2 features scores from the 19th century on and includes
scores from Schoenberg, Bartók, Copland, and others. 
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The best way to use these books is to own or check out a recording of the
score being studied so that you can follow along with the written material.
For the novice score reader, this is an exciting new way to study music; for
the more advanced score reader, these books provide the opportunity to
really study a composer’s technique in a whole new way. Both books are writ-
ten for the expert and the novice alike, with significant sections of the scores
highlighted to make following the piece easier without dumbing down any of
the material. 
Another great thing about these books is that you have all this truly amazing
sheet music at your fingertips. When you’re feeling particularly uninspired to
write your own music, sit down and analyze and play a section of Mozart’s
Don Giovanni or Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto — it might be just the thing
you need to get inspired to write something entirely new!
How to Grow as a Musician
by Sheila E. Anderson, Allworth Press
This is a really fun and informative book to read, one that is aimed specifi-
cally at the touring and recording musician. There is a lot of information here
about booking a tour, mentally preparing yourself for live performances in
both familiar and unfamiliar settings, marketing yourself, and even figuring
out how much to charge for different types of performances. Contracts and
royalties are discussed in great detail, as are all the hidden fees that can pop
up even after a contract is signed. 
Anderson’s background as a jazz radio journalist makes this a great book to
just sit down and read even if you’re not planning on going on tour or even
into the studio; the book contains tons of great stories about the ups and
downs of being a professional musician, including anecdotes from jazz greats
like Ruth Brown and Michael Wolff. It also contains advice provided by attor-
neys working within the music business. 
Analysis of Tonal Music: 
A Schenkerian Approach
by Alan Cadwallader and David Gagné, Oxford University Press
Schenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis based on the theories of
Heinrich Schenker, a music theorist of the early 20th century. In Schenkerian
analysis, the basic goal is to reveal the tonal structure of a piece of music by
reducing the music using a specialized, symbolic form of musical notation
275
Chapter 22: Ten Recommended Books for Composers

devised by Schenker. The analysis reveals the inner musical workings of the
music, dividing it into what is called the foreground and the fundamental
structure. The foreground is the part of the music that immediately attracts a
listener’s attention, such as the rhythm or the repeated chord changes; the
fundamental structure is composed of the arrhythmic pitch events that help
keep the music from sounding mechanical. 
The beauty of Schenkerian analysis is that it is completely subjective, and
there is no right or wrong answer to how each individual dissects a piece of
music. Each analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst, and shows
what he or she thinks is the underlying structure or most important parts of
a given piece of music. It’s a more philosophical way of studying music than
most theoretical approaches, and one more way to learn how to really sit and
listen to a piece of music, instead of allowing it to disappear into background
noises at a cocktail party. 
The Virgin Directory of World Music
by Philip Sweeney, Owl Books/Henry Holt & Company
This is an extremely well-organized summary of traditional music from
around the world. The book is divided into specific regions of the world:
Africa (North, West, Central, South, and East), Europe (North, South, and
East), the Middle East and India, and so on. Each division is then broken
down into the states and countries of those regions, with detailed descrip-
tions of the types of traditional music coming from those regions. There’s
even detailed mention of notable performers who recorded and released
albums of the music of their region, from Ladysmith Black Mambazo to
Jamaica’s Jolly Boys. 
The Rough Guide to Classical 
Music, 4th Edition
edited by Joe Staines and Duncan Clark, published by Rough Guides, 
distributed by Penguin
The Rough Guides are arguably the best music-critique book series out there,
with titles ranging from The Rough Guide to Reggae to The Rough Guide to
Opera. This book works for people who are just taking their first steps into
the world of classical music appreciation — and for those who are massive
classical music fans already but want to see if they’ve overlooked any essential
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

composers or recordings. Each composer’s entry is divided into the types of
music the composer delved into, where his or her influence is most felt in
later composers’ works, and even the political pressures that made them
write the types of music they did. 
Overall, the guidebook contains the biographies of more than 160 classical
composers, spanning from as far back as the 14th century to the present, 
and offers print reviews of some of the most relevant recordings of each com-
poser’s work. The main performers on these recordings are also discussed 
in brief, with an explanation of why the album being mentioned is the absolute
best one for you to pick up. 
Fun to either read straight through or to jump around in as a reference book,
it’s an indispensable guide to anyone who wants to learn more about classi-
cal music without getting bogged down by the snobbery that can accompany
the genre. 
American Mavericks
edited by Susan Key and Larry Roethe, University of California Press
This book is gorgeous enough to be a coffee table book, and, if you’re as
obsessed with music as we are and you have a coffee table, you really should
pick up a copy. It’s loaded with fantastic photographs of unique American
composers and their equally unique choices of instruments. It features in-
depth profiles of composers as varied and dissimilar as John Cage, Aaron
Copland, Steve Mackey, and Carl Ruggles. The book also comes with a CD
containing 18 tracks of music — one for every composer and several from
albums that are just about impossible to find in your local record store.

Les Baxter, Robert Moog on the theremin, Juan Esquivel on the Latin music 
of the 1950s, and Yma Sumac on her own mythical life. Both volumes contain
many, many more interviews and articles than what we’ve just mentioned

t’s one thing to sit and read piles of sheet music and composition books
and learn how notes scientifically fit against one another, but it’s another
thing to truly try to “get” music. To do so, you’ve got to listen to it, lots and
lots and lots of it, and to as many different types as you can. And boy, is there
a lot of music out there to explore. 
The most interesting periods of music are usually those at the turning point
from one accepted style to the next, such as the break from baroque music to
classical music, guitar rock to Krautrock and later to math rock and so on.
These turning points are generally not recognized at all by general audiences
from that period and are, in fact, often dismissed as passing fads; with hind-
sight, it’s much easier to tell which composers and what period of music
ended up making the greatest impact on the course of Western music. 
Because this book is mostly concerned with the Western musical tradition of
composition, we’ve confined our choices here to the Western canon. However,
there is more than half a globe not even mentioned here that is worth writing
extra volumes about. 
Classical Music
The term classical music has become sort of a catch-all phrase for any sort of
“highbrow” music that uses orchestral instruments and arrangements — 
violins, solo piano, flutes, oboes, and so forth — therefore lumping about

1,500 years’ worth of music into one neat little category. A purist, however,
would say that true classical music has to be music composed approximately
between the years 1750 and 1820 in Europe, with lots of copycats coming
afterwards in America.
We’re not purists, in case you couldn’t tell by now, so we’re sticking with the
broad, lumping term classical to describe the types of music discussed in this
section, which are some of the most significant milestones to happen to
Western classical music along the way.
Medieval period: the monophonic 
phase (590–1200)
In the 7th century A.D., Pope Gregory, later canonized as the patron saint of
musicians, declared that the human voice was the only instrument appropri-
ate for glorifying God. All instruments were therefore banned from worship
services, to be replaced by more and more complex vocal choirs. 
Although some may look at this decree as being a step backwards in the evo-
lution of human music, it was actually the first step forwards in truly explor-
ing the capabilities of the human voice. The Gregorian chants — named after
Gregory, but not directly invented by him — were the apex of a capella, mono-
phonic (as in, everyone sang the same notes together) singing of the time,
expanding on the storytelling plainchant singing that had come to Rome
through the indigenous peoples of Europe who had been conquered and
assimilated by the Romans. 
As only the human voice was allowed within the structure of Church music, the
greatest contribution this period made to modern music was the evolution of
singing. By 850 A.D., Gregorian chant had given way to polyphonic singing —
which is when you have two unrelated voices singing at once (melody and har-
mony), and by the beginning of the 11th century, it was the music of choice,
even after polyphonic music was declared “illegal” by the papacy.
Around 1000 A.D., a Benedictine monk named Guido D’Arezzo completely
reworked the crude neumatic music notation used for Gregorian chant and
designed his own music staff. His staff still used the four lines of the neumatic
staff, but he added a time signature at the beginning of the staff to make it
easier for performers to keep up with one another. He also devised solfege, a
vocal scale system that replaced the four tones used by the Greeks with six
tones: ut (later changed to do), re, mi, fa, so, and la, to be placed in specific
spots on the staff. Later, when the diatonic scale was combined with the
“Guido Scale,” as it’s sometimes called, the ti sound finished out the octave.
The Sound of Music just wouldn’t be the same without it. 
280
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Although most composers from this time wrote anonymously, a few dared 
to attach their names to their incredible vocal compositions. One such 
composer — a woman, no less — wrote such incredible choral music that 
her work is still performed and recorded today. Hildegard von Bingen was 
the Abbess of Rupertsburg in Germany in the 12th century A.D. She began to
record her religious visions in the form of poetry beginning about 1150, pro-
viding written melodic outlines using the Church’s archaic neumatic notation.
She is one of the first identifiable composers in the history of Western music.
Her compositions are also some of the only music known from that time that
suggest female voices for the high notes, and not boys or men castrated 
as boys.
Pre-classical period (1700–1770)
This particular period of music is sometimes divided into two separate peri-
ods of music, depending on who’s doing the lecturing: the Third Polyphonic
Phase of the Late Baroque Period (roughly 1700–1750) and the Pre-classical
Period (roughly 1720–1770). However, it works better to lump the two 
“periods” together because there is so much intermingling of composers 
and time frames that it’s hard to decide which composer belongs to which
particular style. 
The main thing that sets this period apart, and what makes it really fascinat-
ing to study, is that this is the period where composers began to truly break
away from the simple and predictable rhythm structures that earmarked
nearly 1,000 years of popular music. Musicians such as Antonio Vivaldi
(1678–1741) created concertos that were so controlled and tense and such 
a true study of the mathematics of rhythm that critics accused his work of
sounding like finger exercises for the violin. Johann Sebastian Bach
(1685–1750) is best known for the prominence of point-counterpoint in his
music, where two basic lines of music were played simultaneously on top of
one another.
Bach’s technique must have seemed liked massive grandstanding back in his
day, when most composers relied on having a lead line of music specifically
defined, with a lesser line of music designed solely for accompaniment. Two
of Bach’s 18 children, Carl Philipp Emanuel (his fifth, 1714–1788) and Johann
Christian (his last, 1735–1782), also grew up to be major composers during
this time frame. The former, known as “the Hamburg Bach,” was the principle
founder of the sonata style of the classical period; the latter, known as “the
London Bach,” wrote many symphonies, operas, and harpsichord works that
are still played today.

Early 20th century (1910–1950)
This period of time is the true bridge between what was known as classical
music and what became known as the avant garde. In Austria, composer
Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) experimented with using the 12-tone scale 
in his music (as opposed to the 8-tone system considered “normal”), creating
some truly disturbing and dark pieces perfectly fit for future horror films. In
Hungary, Béla Bartók drew heavily on the dying folk music of his countrymen
to create beautifully dark pieces for both orchestral arrangements and solo
piano. 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., Charles Ives (1874–1954) mixed complex harmonies,
polyrhythms, and polytonalities with early American hymns and folk music,
leading to his eventual winning of the Pulitzer Prize for Music. His country-
man John Cage (1912–1922) laid some of the groundwork for future minimal-
ists in his compositions, requiring audiences to listen to his recorded works
via dozens of radios and record players simultaneously — almost overnight
making the United States the birthplace of experimental music.
This period of music especially is earmarked by a desperation of composers
to really speak to audiences in a time of world-wide turbulence (the two
World Wars). Much of the classical music of this time is drawn directly from
native traditional music in an attempt to connect with the “common man,” as
opposed to previous generations of composers, who admittedly were trying
to attract the attention of the well-heeled genteel classes.
Minimalism (1950-present)
If you ever find yourself in a conversation with composer Steve Reich, don’t
dare refer to his music as minimalism, because he’ll threaten to wash your
mouth out with soap. However, his work, as well as that of Philip Glass, Terry

Nick Currie, a.k.a. Momus
I love baroque music. Bach, of course, is my
favorite classical composer. I love that basso
continuo thing, that simple, strong counter-
point that happens in baroque music. I love
how it defines chords in a fleeting, subtle way
rather than the sledgehammer way rock and
folk tend to do, with their strummed or fuzzed
chord sequences filling out the whole dynamic
spectrum of the sound, leaving no space, no
ambiguity. I call rock’s tendency to hog the
whole audible sound area — from deep bass
to the hiss of the high-hats — “full-spectrum
dominance,” and I really think of it as some-
what fascist. Baroque music is more like a
sympathetic relationship between two lines,
which create harmony and chords by their
courtly dance around each other.

Riley, John Adams, and Arvo Pärt, has all been lumped together under this
category. 
Minimalist music springs from the exploratory work started by John Cage
and is a genre concerned with finding the absolute right note or rhythm for a
piece of music. Philip Glass’s work has been earmarked by his songs built
around complex rhythms and early use of the synthesizer. In the 1970s, Arvo
Pärt put Estonia on the musical map by introducing a new style of composi-
tion he called tintinnabuli, based on a two-part homophonic texture that is
simply breathtaking in its incredible sparseness. In the 1960s, Steve Reich
was one of the first to work tape loops into his rhythm-oriented composi-
tions, possibly making him responsible for inspiring much of the electronic
loop-based music to come nearly 20 years later. 
Jazz
One unexpected side effect of the Civil War in the United States was that after
it ended, pawn shops all over the South were suddenly stocked with brass
and percussive instruments hocked by former members of military bands.
Suddenly, instruments that had never been owned by anyone outside of the
military or nobility were now readily available to the common man. One thing
led to another, and, well, jazz has been called the one truly American art form.
Early jazz (roughly 1890–1930)
New Orleans was a fitting home for the birthplace of jazz. The city was a thriv-
ing international center of commerce at the turn of the century — unlike the
rest of the economically devastated South. Because of its seaport location at
the delta of the Mississippi River, it became a melting pot for seemingly a
whole world of cultures. Musical influences from Africa, Spain, Italy, South
America, and France combined with blues, folk music, and ragtime to create
New Orleans jazz, which was invented and further developed by African
Americans. Later, in the 1920s, jazz migrated to Chicago, New York, and
Kansas City when the black population of the segregated South moved up
North to find better job opportunities. 
Some of the amazing characters from this time were pianist/composer Jelly
Roll Morton, whose massive hands could bang out four octaves’ worth of
chords at a time. On the brass, Joe “King” Oliver, Freddie Keppard, Louis
Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Jimmy Noone, and Kid Ory blazed a new trail
through the tame and timid (and mostly white) music scene of the day with
their wild improvisation, unorthodox instrumentation, and obvious sheer
delight in just playing music. Anyone who thinks that jazz is something con-
fined to snooty and sophisticated cocktail bars has obviously not checked
out any of the guys mentioned above.

Avant garde (1960s)
With the civil unrest of the 1960s came a slew of brand new types of musical
expression, including a brand new form of jazz. The avant garde/free jazz
movement encouraged composers to find their own path in music and find
their own true individual voice, instead of following the styles and rules of
jazz that had come before. In a lot of ways, the only reason that these musi-
cians were considered jazz performers at all was because they used jazz
instruments (specifically the whole family of horns), and many critics at the
time declared that these pioneers really weren’t jazz musicians — and even
that the atonal, arrhythmic soundscapes they created wasn’t even music.
Building on what composers Charles Mingus, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane
had started the previous decade with their own forays into improvisational
and modal jazz, Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, and
Sun Ra stretched the definition of jazz with raw energy and seeming on-the-
spot spontaneous performances that challenged everything that had previ-
ously been expected of music. Present-day free jazz artists worth checking
out include the amazing John Zorn, Mark Feldman, Dave Douglas, and 
Tim Berne.
Rock
Rock and roll is now more than 60 years old and still going strong. Its influ-
ence on popular music has been so pervasive that some of the more interest-
ing corners of it have been forgotten. Here we mention just a few of these.
Krautrock
In case you didn’t guess it already, Krautrock was German rock. Specifically, it
was a style of experimental German rock from the 1960s and 1970s, dubbed
Krautrock derogatorily by the English press, who were still not open to any-
thing coming out of Germany.
Just as free jazz was called jazz mostly because of the instrumentation
involved, Krautrock was considered rock because it used the guitar/bass/
percussion dynamic of a rock band. The music, though, drew heavily on 
minimalism and other experimental classical music forms. It sometimes 
used electronic instruments to give the music a powerfully stark and
machine-driven feel and sound. 
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Krautrock encompassed way too many styles and ideas to truly be considered
a single movement. 1970s group Faust incorporated pop sensibilities with
rhythmic experiments and tape loops, while other groups like Neu! and
Kraftwerk strove to sound as cold and mechanical and devoid of humanity as
possible. Can drew heavily on American minimalism and German classical
music to create incredibly beautiful and concise rock music, while Popol Vuh
took rock instruments and created ambient music that sounded both futuris-
tic and incredibly ancient. 
Math rock (1990s)
Math rock developed in the 1990s as a direct rebellion against rock and roll’s
traditional 4/4 beat. Math rock is based on complex time signatures such as
7/8, 11/8, or 13/8, giving the music a definite irregular feel.
Perhaps because of the complexity of the music, lyrics aren’t a big part of most
of these songs. Albums from bands like Slint, Don Cabellero, June of 44, and
Bastro were often instrumental-only, whereas other bands such as Shellac,
early Modest Mouse, and U.S. Maple included such truly discordant and free-
form lyrics in their songs they felt as though they were put there simply to
throw off the traditional rock music fan even further. 
Post-rock (1980s–present)
Post-rock can almost be considered the direct descendant of the ambient rock
of Krautrock. All the traditional rock instruments are there — guitar, percus-
sion, bass, keyboards — but they are used in completely different ways than
in old-fashioned rock and roll. Guitar feedback and static are used to create
gorgeous backdrops of ambient sound. Layers of keyboard washes are used
to fill in the spaces between notes. Vocals — if there are any — are recorded
at the same levels as the instruments, instead of on top of the music, so that
the listener’s attention isn’t immediately drawn to them. 
As with the Krautrock genre, the bands that are considered post-rock vary
incredibly in construction and sound. The Kentucky band Rachel’s is put
together like a chamber ensemble, using stringed instruments and piano
along with guitars and keyboards, turning out instrumentals that are too dark
and tense for most classical audiences, yet not “rock” enough to be consid-
ered truly rock and roll. England’s Stereolab puts out pleasant pop songs that
are so densely layered it’s hard to tell where one instrument ends and another
one (including the vocals) begins. Canada’s Godspeed You Black Emperor!
builds incredibly intense arrangements out of traditional rock instruments,
drawing both on the traditions of minimalism and ambient music.

Right Now
Every minute of every day, round the clock, something new is being tried out
by an artist or an ensemble out there. As of this writing, there’s an explosion
of new noise, electronic, ambient, rock — you name it — artists out there
releasing records, posting MP3s on free download sites, and just playing live
at the bar down the street from you. If you’re not looking for it, you’re not
going to find it.

Music Composition For Dummies 

Appendix B
Glossary
accompaniment: The use of additional music to support a lead melodic line.
anacrusis: Note(s) preceding the first full measure in a piece of music, some-
times called a pick-up. 
atonal: Music that is not in a key and not organized diatonically.
augmentation dot: A dot placed after a note or rest that extends its value by
one half of the original value. (See dotted note and dotted rest.)
back phrasing: Moving a melody to begin later than it is expected.
bar form: A typical musical form in three sections: AAB.
bar lines: Vertical lines in written music that separate notes into different
groups of notes and rests, depending on the time signature used.
bass clef: The lower staff in the grand staff. The bass clef establishes the
pitch of the notes on the lines and spaces of the staff below middle C.
beam: A bar used instead of a flag to connect the stems of eighth notes and
smaller notes.
beat: A series of repeating, consistent pulsations of time in music. Each 
pulsation is called a beat.
binary form: A two-art musical form: AB.
bpm: Beats per minute.
bridge: The contrasting musical section between two similar sections of music.
Also sometimes called the B section.
cadence: The ending of a musical phrase, containing points of repose or
release of tension.

cadenza: A solo section near or at the end of a piece of music in which the
soloist improvises or plays in a virtuoso style.
call and response: When a soloist is answered by another musician or group
of musicians.
chord: The simultaneous sounding of at least two pitches or notes.
chord progression: Moving from one chord to another, usually in established
patterns.
compound time: A meter whose beat count can be equally divided up into
thirds (6/8, 9/4, and so on) with the exception of any time signature that has 
a 3 as the top number of its time signature (as in 3/4 or 3/8 time).
counterpoint: The art of combining multiple complementary melodies.
cut time: Another name for 2/2 time.
da capo: To repeat from the beginning. Often abbreviated D.C.
devil’s interval: The augmented fourth (or flatted fifth), a dissonant interval
that was once banned by the Catholic Church. Also called the tri-tone.
diatonic: Conforming to the notes found in a given key. In a piece written in C
major, for example, the C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are all diatonic pitches, and any
other notes used in the piece are non-diatonic.
diminution: Re-writing of a melody in rhythmic values smaller than what was
originally used.
dotted note: A note followed by an augmentation dot means the note is worth
one and a half times its normal value.
dotted rest: A rest followed by an augmentation dot means the rest is worth
one and a half times its normal value.
double bar: Two closely spaced vertical lines to indicate the end of a 
composition.
downbeat: The accented beats in a measure.
duet: A composition for two soloists. May have accompaniment.
duplet: Used in compound time to divide a beat that should contain three
equal parts into two equal parts.
312
Music Composition For Dummies 

etude: A piece of music composed to help a performer develop technical 
abilities.
finale: The final movement in a multi-movement composition.
flag: A curved line added to the stem of a note to indicate a reduced rhythmic
value. Flags are equivalent to beams.
form: The overall shape, organization, or structure of a musical composition.
Forms may arise from very persistent genres.
front phrasing: Moving a melody to begin earlier than it is expected.
genre: A style or manner of music.
grand staff: The combination of the bass clef staff and the treble clef staff.
half step: The smallest interval in Western music, represented on the piano
by moving one key (black or white) to the left or right from a starting point,
or on the guitar as one fret up or down from a starting point. Also called a
semitone.
harmonic overtone: Sympathetic frequencies produced by a tone that are
integer multiples of the fundamental tone (as opposed to inharmonic over-
tones, which are non-integer multiples).
harmony: Pitches heard simultaneously in ways that produce chords and
chord progressions.
heterophony: Simultaneous use of varied forms of one basic melody. Notes
may be omitted and/or changed.
homophony: Layers of musical activity that move at the same rhythm, such
as melody and accompaniment.
improvisation: Spontaneous musical creation.
incidental music: Music composed to enhance a film or play.
interval: The pitch distance between two notes.
key: Normally defined by the beginning and ending chord of a musical com-
position and by the order of whole steps and half steps between tonic scale
degrees (in the key of C, for example, this would be represented by the first 
C of the scale and the C an octave above the first).
313
Appendix B: Glossary

key signature: A series of sharps or flats (or lack of both) at the beginning of
each staff following the clef.
lead sheet: A scaled-down, notated melody with chord symbols, usually for
rock or jazz music, on which a musical performance is based.
leitmotiv: A melody, chord, or rhythm used in musicals, opera, cinema, 
and other visual arts that reoccurs throughout the production to identify a
place, object, idea, or character. This compositional technique builds famil-
iarity for the audience.
libretto: The text of an opera or other dramatic works.
measure: Also called a bar. A segment of written music, contained within two
vertical bars, that contains as many beats as the top number of the key signa-
ture indicates.
medley: A composition that strings a group of well-known tunes together to
form a new composition. 
melody: A succession of musical tones, usually of varying pitch and rhythm,
that together have an identifiable shape and meaning.
meter: The organization of rhythmic patterns in a composition in such a way
that a regular, repeating pulse of beats continues throughout the composition.
metronome: A device that maintains a steady beat at varying speeds. It is
common for composers to use metronome markings at the beginning of a
piece to indicate how fast the piece should be played.
middle C: The C note located right between the two musical staffs in the grand
staff (numbered as C4).
modulation: Transition from one key to another.
notation: The use of written or printed symbols to represent musical sounds.
note: A symbol used to represent the duration of a sound and, when placed
on a music staff, the pitch of the sound.
octave: Two tones that span eight different diatonic pitches that have the
same pitch quality and the same pitch names in Western music.
orchestration: The art of composing or arranging for orchestra.
pick-up notes: Introductory notes placed before the first measure in a piece
of music.
314
Music Composition For Dummies 

pitch: The highness or lowness of a tone produced by a single frequency.
polyphony: Layers of different melodic and rhythmic activity within a single
piece of music.
polytonality: The simultaneous use of material from different keys.
quaver: Also called an eighth note or eighth rest.
refrain: A periodically recurring section of music and/or text.
rest: Symbol used to notate a period of silence.
retrograde: A restatement of notes in the reverse order in which they 
originally appeared.
rhythm: The notation of time in music through the use of symbols and 
patterns.
rondo: A musical form that is divided into five or seven parts with reoccurring
refrains: ABACA, ABACABA.
scale: A series of notes in ascending or descending order that presents the
pitches of a key, beginning and ending on the tonic of that key.
score: A printed version of a piece of music.
simple time: A time signature in which the accented beats of each measure
are divisible by two, as in 4/4 time.
solo: An entire composition or section within a composition for a single 
performer.
song: A musical composition in which vocals are used.
staff: Five horizontal, parallel lines, containing four spaces between them, on
which notes and rests are written.
syncopation: A deliberate disruption of the two- or three-beat stress pattern,
most often by stressing an off-beat, or a note that is not on the beat.
tablature: A system of notation that indicates pitches by numbers or letters
rather than notes. Generally used for guitar and bass guitar.
tempo: The rate or speed of the beat in a piece of music.
315
Appendix B: Glossary

ternary form: A typical three-part song form. ABA.
timbre: The unique quality of sound.
time signature: A notation made at the beginning of a piece of music, in the
form of two numbers such as 3/4, that indicates the number of beats in 
each measure or bar and which note value constitutes one beat. The top 
(or first) number tells how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom (or
second) number tells which kind of note receives the count of one beat.
tonal: A song or section of music which is organized by key or scale.
transposition: The transferring of a piece of music from its original key to
another.
treble clef: Symbol written at the beginning of the upper musical staff in the
grand staff. The treble clef establishes the pitch of the notes on the lines and
spaces of the staff existing above middle C.
triad: A chord of three tones.
trill: When a player rapidly alternates between two notes next to one another.
triplet: Used in simple time to divide a beat that should contain two equal
parts into three equal parts.
turnaround: A chord progression leading back to the beginning of a musical
composition.
whole step: An interval consisting of two half steps, represented on the piano
by moving two adjacent keys, black or white, to the left or right from a start-
ing point, or on the guitar as two frets up or down the neck from a starting
point.
