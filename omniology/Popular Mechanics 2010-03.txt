I recently took my Suzuki SX4 
to the dealership to have the 
Ô¨Üandard lube, oil and Ô¨Ålter 
service. e car has about 
16,000 miles on it. e 
mechanic called and told me 
the throttle also needed to be 
cleaned. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with 
that service, so I did an Internet 
search on ‚ÄúDoes a throttle 
have to be cleaned on a car?‚Äù 
e Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü article to pop up was 
written by Mike Allen and 
published in the May 2001 
issue of POPULAR MECHANICS. It 
clearly explained the complete 
procedure and when it was 
appropriate to have it done.

for Mike Allen‚Äôs articles in the

Digital Species 
I enjoyed your article on the 
technology behind the movie 
Avatar (‚ÄúView From the Brink,‚Äù 
Jan. ‚Äò10), especially how 
direor James Cameron 
developed new cameras and 
soware that combine live 
aion and animation to create 
the digital version of the 
movie‚Äôs charaers. is blend 
of digital and human elements 
makes one ponder the 
relationship between the 
aors and the charaers. 
Since the Ô¨Ånal animation is so 
intimately tied to the aor‚Äôs 
portrayal of the charaer, yet 
so heavily dependent upon the 
direor‚Äôs digital manipulation, 
do movie viewers Ô¨Üill witness 
the artiÔ¨Ü‚Äôs pure cra of aing? 
As this technique improves, 
which I think is bound to 
happen, the diÔ¨Üinion 
between digital and traditional 
Ô¨Ålm charaers is going to be 
increasingly blurred‚Äîand our 
concept of reality will be 
chipped away yet again by  
new technology!
PAT TRIBBLE
SUMMIT POINT, WV
I applaud James Cameron for 
his patience during the 10-year 
process of developing the 
innovative technology to 
create his Ô¨Ålm Avatar. e 
imagination and desires of this 
artiÔ¨Ü have pushed the bounds 
of possibility. Hopefully, the 
developments for the Ô¨Ålm will 
not be limited to the realm of 
entertainment and will some 
day spread into other, more 
praical applications.

$1.2 Million  
in Milk Money
When a trio of inveÔ¨Üors bought Missy the cow for a record-
setting $1.2 million at an auion at Toronto‚Äôs Royal Agricultural 
Winter Fair, outsiders gained a glimpse into the arcane world of 
elite liveÔ¨Üock breeding. Whether it‚Äôs the width of her hips or the 
protein content of her milk, Missy excels. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got the total pack-
age,‚Äù says Michael Hutjens, a dairy specialiÔ¨Ü at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Missy‚Äôs value is enhanced by the 
likelihood that she will pass those excellent genes on to genera-
tions of oÔ¨Äspring. Any male calves will be especially valuable for 
their sperm. Within the next seven years, dairy farmers expe 
that there could be 60 to 75 cattle carrying Missy‚Äôs genes.
WHY IS MISSY THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE DAIRY COW 
IN THE WORLD?  
BY ERIN SCOTTBERG 
Z`q
e preferred 
width is at leaÔ¨Ü 8 
inches. A cow with 
Ô¨Ürong ligaments 
supporting the 
udder is less likely 
to get a mammary 
gland infeion 
because its udder 
is farther from the 
ground.
v`q
Dairy farmers 
prefer that the 
teats of dairy 
cows Ô¨Åt into 
milking 
machines‚Äîthey 
should be 
perpendicular to 
the Ô¨Çoor and have 
a cylindrical shape. 
Missy‚Äôs milk 
makes more 
cheese per volume 
because it‚Äôs so 
protein-rich. 
t`q

e width between 
Missy‚Äôs rear legs is 
important because 
it allows room for 
the udder; the wide 
space between her 
front legs indicates 
a large cheÔ¨Ü 
cavity, a sign of a 
healthy heart. 
Digital forensic tools have added to the evidence that 
Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone gunman rather than 
part of a conspiracy to kill President John F. Kennedy. 
Hany Farid, direor of the Neukom InÔ¨Üitute for 
Computational Science at Dartmouth College, 
analyzed a famous photo of Oswald that some say 
muÔ¨Ü have been doored, because the shadows 
under Oswald‚Äôs nose and behind his body appear to 
be caused by diÔ¨Äerent light sources. However, Farid 
found no sign of tampering when he measured for 
inconsiÔ¨Üencies in the image‚Äôs underlying pixels.  
He also created a 3D image of Oswald that demon-
Ô¨Ürated that both shadows could have been made by 
the sun at the time Oswald‚Äôs wife took the photo. 
Farid says that the image would be hard to fake 
today, and likely impossible using 1963 technology.

As government 
agencies and corpora-
tions tighten security, 
new technology is 
promising to let them 
incorporate eye-scan 
data into identiÔ¨Åca-
tion cards. At a 
checkpoint, an eye 
scanner would match 
the subje‚Äôs iris to an 
image Ô¨Üored on the 
card‚Äîmaking it easy 
to spot a fake ID or an 
impoÔ¨Üor. Iris images 
are about 30 
kilobytes in size, but 
the Ô¨Åles muÔ¨Ü be 
condensed to 3 KB to 
be used on a card, 
and that compression 
degrades the image‚Äôs 
resolution. In Ô¨Üudies 
funded by the 
Department of Home-
land Security, the 
National InÔ¨Üitute of 
Standards and 
Technology identiÔ¨Åed 
compression 
technologies that  
could be used in  
new passports and

perhaps even national

Larry Fullerton is a former NASA 
engineer with experience developing 
advanced radar syÔ¨Üems and ultra-wide-
band communications technology for the 
military. But when he tried to assemble 
toys for his grandchildren, he found 
himself Ô¨Üumped. ‚ÄúWhat if these could 
self-assemble?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI knew it would 
have to be done with magnets.‚Äù MoÔ¨Ü 
magnets used in self-assembly initiate 
aion by using elericity to switch their 
north and south poles. But Fullerton had 
an idea: What if he could inÔ¨Üill multiple 
poles, inÔ¨Üead of juÔ¨Ü two, into magnetic 
material? 
Fullerton is now serving as CEO and 
chief scientiÔ¨Ü of Alabama-based Corre-
lated Magnetics Research, which late laÔ¨Ü 
year unveiled magnetic devices unlike any 
others. When the correlated patterns on 
CMR‚Äôs magnets match‚Äîwith the opposite 
charges Ô¨Åtting together like jigsaw puzzle 
pieces‚Äîthey attra and clasp. With a 
slight rotation, the correlation is loÔ¨Ü and 
the two sides can be easily separated. 
Imagine a supereÔ¨Écient freezer door that 
seals at 25 pounds per square inch but 
can be opened aer a turn of the wriÔ¨Ü 
reduces the attraive force to 4 psi. 
CMR is looking to license tech to 
various induÔ¨Üries, so these magnets 
could conceivably turn up almoÔ¨Ü 
anywhere, particularly in niche markets 
such as NASA hardware and military gear. 
Programmable magnets could be used to 
seal spaceship hatches, to create 
friion-free proÔ¨Ühetic ball joints and to 
make long-laÔ¨Üing gears for engines. In 
truly foolproof assemblies, smart 
magnets would ensure that every part 
links only where it belongs. Experts say 
the physics makes sense. ‚ÄúIt seems to be 
legitimate engineering,‚Äù says Bill Butler, 
the direor of the University of Alabama‚Äôs 
Center for Materials for Information 
Technology. ‚ÄúIt also seems to be elemen-
tary. at said, sometimes the beÔ¨Ü ideas 
are the simple ones.‚Äù

 When the patterns align, the 
magnets stick tightly together. 
Rotating one magnet reduces the 
attraction. Placing these magnets 
in a refrigerator door would form a 
seal that users could open easily.

When one magnetic disc turns, 
the other corresponds without 
touching. CMR engineers built a 
nearly friionless generator that 
is run by a wind turbine.
The blank face of 
typical magnets, 
shown here under 
metal-infused mag-
netic-field paper, 
can be imprinted 
with multiple poles. 
Fullerton uses a 
powerful electro-
magnetic print head 
to trace new pat-
terns onto magnets. 
He also developed 
a method to make 
more precise pat-
terns: He heats 
magnetic material 
to the point that it 
loses its magnetism, 
then reprograms the 
material by bringing 
it into contact with 
a magnetic stamp. 
The stamp instills 
new field patterns, 
and when the 
material cools, the 
multipole pattern 
remains.

Max speed:

How it works: An 
engine harnesses 
the enormous 
energy released 
when matter and 
antimatter come 
into conta. 
Tradeoffs: Creating 
enough antimatter 
in particle 
accelerators is 
currently impossible. 
e engine would 
also have a 
damaging kick and 
produce a lot of 
radiation.
Update: Penn 
State researchers 
have conceived of an 
engine to drive a 
spacecra with 
shock absorbers 
tough enough to 
survive the collisions 
of protons and 
antiprotons.
 
Chemical combuÔ¨Üion engines are an unbeatable technology 
for escaping Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and gravitational pull. In 
space, however, these rockets are ineÔ¨Écient‚Äîthey burn through 
huge quantities of fuel while generating more thruÔ¨Ü than necessary. 
at‚Äôs why researchers are increasingly turning to nonchemical 
propulsion syÔ¨Üems, which could draÔ¨Üically lighten spacecra while 
achieving higher speeds. Some of the ideas being researched, like 
antimatter engines, depend on eÔ¨Üablished physics but go far 
beyond current technology. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs got to think beyond the obvious,‚Äù says Marc 
Millis, a propulsion physiciÔ¨Ü at NASA‚Äôs Glenn Research Center. ‚ÄúYou have enough other 
people in the world doing the next obvious thing. By reaching beyond that, you can 
discover the breakthroughs other folks aren‚Äôt even looking for, and change everything.‚Äù

Once the design was 
Ô¨Ånalized, Baker took a 
mold, or lifecaÔ¨Ü, of Del

artiÔ¨Ü sculpted canine 
features on the lifecaÔ¨Ü. 
From those sculptures 
he created Ô¨Åberglass molds, which he 
Ô¨Ålled with foam latex. e molds were 
cured for 8 hours to create the appliances 
that Baker adhered to Del Toro‚Äôs face: 
FirÔ¨Ü, a cowl with the canine ears, then a 
face piece with a snout. e laÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üep was 
laying Ô¨Ürands of yak hair by hand. Despite 
his long legacy of creating cinematic 
werewolves, Baker feels a special aÔ¨Énity 
for this remake. ‚Äúe classic Universal 
horror Ô¨Ålms are why I do what I do for a 
living,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to know that in 
this day and age, makeup is Ô¨Üill consid-

Let‚Äôs review: Over the paÔ¨Ü year we‚Äôve been asked  
to buy a new smartphone, a netbook, a tablet PC, and 
now, a smartbook? If manufaurers are to be believed, 
the next big computer category will be ultratiny

promise of always-on Internet conneivity (like some

praical way of 
logging on to WiMax 
yet. Like other 
mobile hotspots, it 
converts airborne 
cellular signals into a 
Wi-Fi feed that any 
PC can use to get 
online. If you‚Äôre in one 
of the (Ô¨Üill-too-few)

it uses a 3G network

e new Buick Regal is a sport sedan. Really. 
Behind that Buick grille is the autobahn-conquering 
Opel Insignia‚Äîa successful European sedan for 
GM. e Regal slots in juÔ¨Ü below the 7-inches-
shorter LaCrosse in the lineup, and the base engine 
is a 182-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder mated to a 
six-speed automatic. e prototypes we drove in 
Michigan had the uplevel 220-hp 2.0-liter turbo 
Four that should hit 60 mph in around 7 seconds 
and deliver 29 mpg on the highway. Compared with 
a LaCrosse, the Regal is the sharper, nimbler, more 
entertaining car. Turbo lag and torque Ô¨Üeer are 
absent and the suspension is Ô¨Årm. If traditional 
Buick cuÔ¨Üomers want a so, Ô¨Çoaty ride, they won‚Äôt 
Ô¨Ånd it here. e Regal is evidence that a smaller, 
nimbler GM could be a good thing.  ‚Äî KEVIN A. WILSON

Old Guard
Something about the new $51,970 
Lexus GX 460 seems archaic. It is 
old-school, oÔ¨Ä-road rugged in a world 
where moÔ¨Ü luxury SUVs have settled for 
being juÔ¨Ü tough enough to lug home a 
gallon of Rocky Road from the Safeway. 
It has a full ladder frame and a solid rear 
axle‚ÄîjuÔ¨Ü like its Toyota brethren, the 
4Runner. e new 301-hp 4.6-liter V8 
under its hood helps it tow a solid 6500 
pounds. And the GX never feels Ô¨Ürained 
or at a loss for thruÔ¨Ü. Like many Lexus 
vehicles, the GX‚Äôs suspension seems 
tuned to smother any hint of road 
conditions long before they‚Äôre communi-
cated to the driver. OÔ¨Ä-road, the GX 460 
really works. e suspension is supple, 
and the ride is composed even when 
bounding over basketball-size ruts and 
football-size rocks. When the going gets 
tough, the GX 460 will crawl over 
obÔ¨Üacles with precision and dignity. 
Considering its oÔ¨Ä-road prowess, the GX 
is among the beÔ¨Ü luxury SUVs for 
people who need to go where paved 
roads don‚Äôt.  ‚Äî JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN
ConÔ¨Ådence Builder
Newcomers to motorcycling face a 
range of sportbikes that are simply 
beyond their capabilities. But this 
Kawasaki isn‚Äôt one of them. e $6699 
ER-6n is essentially a toned-down, naked 
and more forgiving version of the Ninja 
650R. It has a Ô¨Üeel frame, and the 
fuel-injeed 649-cc parallel-twin engine 
is tuned for broad torque. And though 
the engine Ô¨Üarts with a snarl, the 
relatively low saddle and upright poÔ¨Üure 
make this bike welcoming. e seating 
position is comfortable enough for short 
and medium legs, but extended time in 
the saddle makes the pushed-againÔ¨Ü-
the-tank position a bit uncomfortable. 
When the road surface twiÔ¨Üs, the ER-6n 
complies with quick turn-ins and nimble 
direion changes. Traversing canyon 
roads yields the moÔ¨Ü riding satisfaion 
and allows this Kawasaki‚Äôs Ô¨ÜrongeÔ¨Ü 
asset‚Äîabsolutely eÔ¨Äortless handling‚Äî
to shine through.  ‚Äî BASEM WASEF

e wide, low-slung, 
leering grille of the new 
$200,000 (eÔ¨Ü.) 
Mercedes SLS AMG Ô¨Ålls 
the rearview mirrors of 
lesser cars with an 
aggressive maw. Yet this 
is one of the moÔ¨Ü 
civilized supercars 
around. Duck under the 
gullwing doors and Ô¨Üep 
across the narrow sill to 
drop into a supportive 
bucket seat, and you Ô¨Ånd 
yourself in an intimate 
cockpit. JuÔ¨Ü don‚Äôt forget 
that there‚Äôs a 563-hp 
6.2-liter V8 under that 
long hood, with all the 
Ô¨Üunning performance 
you‚Äôd expe. Let the 
beaÔ¨Ü spin hard‚Äîthe 
intensity increases 
speacularly as the revs 
rise. It pulls so hard in 
the upper reaches that 
it‚Äôs all too easy to run 
into the limiter beyond 
the 7300-rpm redline. 
Fun? Oh yeah.

Hot-Rod Hybrid
The ultimate driving machine 
should be, well, ultimate. e  
watered-down, disconneed driving 
experience conveyed by some hybrids 
would be inappropriate in a BMW, right? 
at‚Äôs why BMW has tuned its execution 
of the two-mode hybrid transmission 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü for responsive performance. e 
eleric drive is paired to the 400-hp 
twin-turbo V8, so combined, this 
$89,725 X6 puts out 480 hp and a 
diesel-like 575 lb- of torque. e X6 
whooshes eÔ¨Äortlessly to freeway 
speeds and beyond with no indication of 
exertion. OÔ¨Ä the line, the hybrid is 
quicker than the regular V8 X5 thanks to 
the torque from its eleric motors, but 
within a few seconds the gas version 
would reel in the hybrid. BMW says it is 
possible to drive up to 1.56 miles in 
eleric-only mode. But this Ô¨Üate 
proved to be elusive on our teÔ¨Ü drive. 
More importantly, the modeÔ¨Ü 17-mpg-
city and 19-mpg-highway ratings make 
this BMW‚Äôs raison d‚Äô√™tre a bit of  
a puzzle.  ‚Äî DAN CARNEY
Benchmarker
Ferrari‚Äôs early cars were dominated 
by V12 engines. But the midengined V8 
sport coupes have been the backbone of 
the company‚Äôs model range for the paÔ¨Ü 
35 years. e lateÔ¨Ü is the swoopy 458 
Italia. Press the big red Ô¨Üarter, and the 
562-hp Ô¨Çat-plane V8 whirs to life without 
a trace of temperament, sounding almoÔ¨Ü 
disappointingly quiet. Pull the right-hand 
paddle, and Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü gear engages with a 
slight thump. As soon as you touch the 
accelerator, the noise changes to a 
hardcore buzz as muÔ¨Ñer valves open. At 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü, the 458 feels darty and abrupt. e 
Ô¨Üeering is so sharp you could cut 
yourself, and it‚Äôs very easy to overdrive 
this car in a series of twitching, elbows-
out wheel movements. If you calm down 
and truÔ¨Ü the Ô¨Üeering, it Ô¨Üarts to feel 
natural. Is it quick? Well, the 458 can hit 
130 mph before a Toyota Prius gets to 
60 mph. Let‚Äôs not discuss fuel economy 
though, eh?  ‚Äî ANDREW ENGLISH

Deja Vroom
Don‚Äôt let the classic shape fool you. 
Porsche‚Äôs new 500-hp 911 Turbo is 
every bit a supercar-level performance 
machine. e launch control boots the 
car out of the blocks with such vigor‚Äîall 
four tires clawing for traion‚Äîthat 
drivers experience a few seconds of 
g-force giddiness. Since the car will only 
launch like this in the automatic-drive 
mode, it proceeds to snap oÔ¨Ä ultrafaÔ¨Ü 
shis as the tachometer needle nears 
its 6800-rpm redline. Porsche engineers 
suggeÔ¨Ü a zero-to-60 mph sprint of 3.2 
seconds is possible. Several revisions to 
the current 997 chassis have improved 
the Turbo‚Äôs Ô¨Üability at speed and in the 
corners. e car‚Äôs newfound prediabil-
ity allowed the Turbo to circulate the 
N√ºrburgring‚Äôs Nordschleife (northern 
loop) some 10 seconds quicker than its 
predecessor. On-road, the $132,800 
Porsche feels more responsive at the 
wheel yet at the same time exhibits 
composure, comfort and quietness. Is 
this the ultimate everyday supercar?  
Could be.  ‚Äî BARRY WINFIELD
Hard Target
The midsize luxury sedan class is 
among the moÔ¨Ü competitive. e cars 
are not merely good‚Äîthey‚Äôre great. Into 
that maelÔ¨Ürom of excellence, InÔ¨Åniti will 
later this spring launch its third- 
generation 2011 M37 and M56. We had 
a chance to drive prototypes recently, 
and found that despite the M56‚Äôs 
420-hp V8, the 330-hp six-cylinder M37 
had the more engaging personality. Yes, 
the M56 is quicker, but that engine (at 
leaÔ¨Ü in prototype) has no discernible 
exhauÔ¨Ü note and a rather easygoing 
personality. In contraÔ¨Ü, the V6 is one of 
the moÔ¨Ü eager and excitable power-
plants on earth. e M56 wants to 
cruise, but the M37 wants to romp, 
rollick and spend the aernoon 
intoxicated by its own redline. Short of 
the turbocharged BMW 535i, the M37 
may be the only six-cylinder-powered car 
in this class that a hardcore driving 
enthusiaÔ¨Ü could really love.  ‚Äî J.P.H.

One look at the new 
Mitsubishi Outlander‚Äôs

lies‚Äîthe Evolution sport 
sedan. But don‚Äôt expe 
the Evo‚Äôs turbocharged 
power here. e 
Outlander GT‚Äôs 3.0-liter 
V6 gains a modeÔ¨Ü bump 
in power to 230 hp. 
Besides the thoroughly 
upgraded cabin, with 
so-touch Ô¨Ånishes and 
leather, the moÔ¨Ü notable 
aspe of the Outlander 
GT is the chassis.  
ere‚Äôs a new all-wheel-
drive syÔ¨Üem and a 
suspension-and-tire 
combination that make 
twiÔ¨Üy roads really fun to 
drive. We blaÔ¨Üed up (and 
down) a mountain road

very prediable

The last time we teÔ¨Ü-drove a Volt 
prototype, it was locked in eleric-only 
mode. But a brief Ô¨Üint recently behind 
the wheel of the car in charge-suÔ¨Üaining 
mode (once the 40-mile eleric-only 
range is depleted, the gas engine doesn‚Äôt 
charge the pack but rather provides the 
eleric motor with precisely the amount 
of elerical energy it needs at the time) 
proved engineers have done a remark-
able job tuning the car. When the 
1.4-liter four-cylinder engine cut in during 
our drive, we barely noticed. If you‚Äôre on 
a Ô¨Üeep climb maintaining a high cruising 
speed, the gas engine might climb as 
high as 5000 rpm to meet the challenge. 
In that case, the engine‚Äôs exertions will 
be very obvious. It sounds a lot like a car 
with a CVT. Engage Sport Mode and 
there‚Äôs an additional 20 kilowatts 
available‚Äîmaking the Volt much more 
fun to drive. ‚Äî BARRY WINFIELD
The plug-in Prius uses exaly the 
same hardware as the Ô¨Üandard Prius. 
e biggeÔ¨Ü diÔ¨Äerence is the battery, a 
5-kilowatt-hour/345.6-volt Panasonic 
unit with a nickel-lithium-oxide cathode, 
a carbon anode and carbonate-eÔ¨Üer 
liquid elerolyte. It raises the trunk Ô¨Çoor 
a couple of inches and adds 242 pounds. 
Like the Ô¨Üandard, the plug-in was 
away using battery power alone. If you 
modulate your right foot oÔ¨Ä the 
Ô¨Çoorboards and keep under 62 mph, and 
if there is enough juice in the battery, the 
Prius Ô¨Üays on battery power for up to 
12.5 miles. In praice, this means the 
engine will Ô¨Üay silent in heavy traÔ¨Éc. 
e transition from battery to gas, which 
has consumed Volt engineers, is 
mercifully smooth here. Toyota expes 
fuel economy to improve 69 percent 
over the Ô¨Üandard Prius, to deliver 
around 81 mpg.  ‚Äî A.E.

ince I‚Äôm one of the few guys on TV who own old 
cars and enjoy restoring them, people often contact 
me about their car projects. Some are restorations 
that folks may have barely started. Others are vehi-
cles they‚Äôve labored over, but never quite Ô¨Ånished. 
Then there are the cars that people have owned for 
40 years, and now they ask me if I‚Äôd like to buy them 
so they end up in a good home.
That‚Äôs how I came to own a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 
300SL Gullwing. It was an old race car that its own-
ers put in a storage container out in the California 
desert in the late 1970s. And the Mercedes just sat 
there for decades. I‚Äôm only the third owner. And 
that makes it special.
The 300SL was ahead of its time, with a tubular 
space frame, fully independent suspension, a fuel-
injected SOHC Six, those cool gullwing doors and a 
lot of racing history. John Fitch won the GT Class in 
the 1955 Mille Miglia, and Ô¨Ånished 
Ô¨Åfth overall in what was basically a 
stock 300SL. But for me, it was always 
a car that was just out of reach. When 
I was in college in 1969, working for 
a Mercedes-Benz dealer, we took one 
in trade. We gave the guy $5500 for it, 
which seemed like a lot of money 
back then. Within 10 days, we‚Äôd sold 
it for $7200. We thought we‚Äôd pulled 
off quite a con job ... we got 7200 
bucks for that thing.  
We‚Äôre restoring the mechanicals 
and the instruments on my Gullwing,

but we‚Äôll leave the worn interior and 
exterior alone. I like not having to 
worry about a freshly sprayed, pristine 
paint job. It‚Äôs very liberating if a screw-
driver falls on the fender and makes a 
mark. You don‚Äôt go, ‚ÄúAaarrrggghhh! 
The Ô¨Årst chip!‚Äù
At some point, we will restore it 
completely. But there‚Äôs something 
charming about having a car that‚Äôs 
used for its original purpose‚Äî
driving. I‚Äôll just 
tool around in 
this coupe for a 
while, and when 
enough purists 
get angry at me, 
we‚Äôll restore it. 
But right now, I 
can take it to 
Bob‚Äôs Big Boy 
and if somebody 
wants to lean on it, I won‚Äôt get upset. I 
don‚Äôt want to be one of those guys 
who says ‚ÄúHey! Hey! Heyyy!‚Äù 
So far, we‚Äôve redone the transmis-
sion, the brakes and the motor. We 
broke in the engine correctly‚Äîon the 
dynamometer. There‚Äôs a diaphragm 
in the Bosch fuel-injection system 
that was originally made of some kind 
of lambskin. The original one was 
faulty, and the engine was running 
way too lean over the 3500 to 4000 
rpm range. But we have a new one in 
now, and it‚Äôs running much better. If 
we had installed the engine in the car 
without the dyno test, we would have 
probably melted a piston, and the 
engine would have been destroyed. 
But luckily, we caught the problem.
These 3-liter Sixes were supposed 
to develop 220 to 240 hp. We cleaned 
it up internally, did a little work to it, 
and we‚Äôre seeing around 180 hp. I was 
disappointed, but I talked to a few 
Mercedes guys, and they said that was 
about right.  It‚Äôs like the Jaguar XKE‚Äî
Jag claimed 265 hp, but it was proba-
bly more like 210 hp. Back then, every-
body lied about horsepower.
The 300SL has beautiful finned 
brake drums, but a chunk of one 
drum was missing. We could have 
made a new one with our CNC 
machine, but instead we called the 
Mercedes-Benz Classic Center, which 
has parts for just about every car the 
company made. They‚Äôre not inexpen-
sive, but try to Ô¨Ånd one anywhere else. 
It‚Äôs brand-new, and it‚Äôs made by Mer-
cedes-Benz. Every Gullwing part is 
available from the Classic Center. 
Honda used to do that. When 
Soichiro Honda, the company‚Äôs 
founder, was alive, he vowed that 
every part for every Honda motorcycle 
would always be available. But once 
he died, they brought in the accoun-
tants who said it wasn‚Äôt viable to keep 
Honda 50 leg shields in stock. Yet 
Mercedes-Benz has always produced 
those parts, and that makes people 
bond with the brand. 
They built just 1402 300SL Gull-
wing coupes, but it was enough to 
support the spare-parts market. If you 
write a book on the Gullwing, you‚Äôll 
always sell at least 1400 of them. If 
you write a book on, say, the Jackson 
car, made in Michigan until 1923, 
you‚Äôll sell five. There might be five 
Jacksons left out there. 
My vintage 300SL Gullwing will be 
Ô¨Ånished at about the same time the 
new SLS AMG Gullwing hits the road 
(see ‚ÄúNew Cars,‚Äù page 35). And the old 
ones still cost more than those brand-
new ones. I think that‚Äôs funny, but I do 
like to see the heritage carried on. The 
Gullwing works because there‚Äôs a bit 
of theater involved. The car requires 
some effort: You can‚Äôt just get in and 
drive it. There are certain things you 
have to know about, whether it‚Äôs as 
simple as the Ô¨Çip-down steering wheel 
or the heater controls. You sort of pilot 
these cars; you don‚Äôt necessarily drive 
them. You have to understand the 
handling limitations of those swing 
axles too‚Äîin high-speed corners they 
can be a handful. Consequently, you 
tend to drive a bit more carefully. 
I‚Äôm not one of those people who 
have to have the ultimate 300SL with 
the knockoff Rudge wheels either. 
That‚Äôs just extra cake frosting. I think 
the regular hubcaps and steel wheels 
look a little nicer. The knockoffs can 
loosen and come off, and I don‚Äôt want 
to drill them and put safety wire on 
them. With lug nuts, I know what I‚Äôm 
doing. It‚Äôs like women who wear those 
high heels. ‚ÄúYes, but they‚Äôre really 
attractive,‚Äù they‚Äôll say. And I think to 
myself, ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre uncomfortable!‚Äù
The Gullwing isn‚Äôt our only Mer-
cedes project. I bought a 6.3-liter 600 
sedan from the 1960s with 324,000 
miles on it‚Äîmy favorite Mercedes 
from a styling and performance point 
of view. I thought, why don‚Äôt we 
install the modern 6.3-liter V8? So 
we‚Äôre putting in a new AMG 563-hp 
V8, like the one in the SLS, with a 
seven-speed transmission. We‚Äôll turn 
it into the ultimate 6.3 Mercedes-
Benz. Stay tuned.

Honda Insight EX Navi
Welcome back, Insight. e original 
and forward-looking Insight hybrid le 
Honda‚Äôs produ line in 2006. It was a 
pioneering vehicle, but it was too 
small and had too (or perhaps two) 
few seats. Now the nameplate has 
returned in an inÔ¨Ånitely more praical 
package, albeit without the industry-
leading fuel economy of the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü one. 
But the new four-door Insight is Ô¨Üill a 
mileage champ. On a recent teÔ¨Ü (see 
Nov. ‚Äô09), the Insight delivered a thriy 
45.3 mpg on our city loop and 43.3 on 
the highway. ose are solid numbers. 
But we knew we could do better. So 
we decided to add an Insight to our 
long-term fleet. The Insight is pro-
pelled by a small 98-hp 1.3-liter four-
cylinder‚Äînot much oomph for even a 
featherweight 2730-pound vehicle. 
But add in the 13 hp and 58 lb-ft of 
torque produced by the eleric motor 
and it‚Äôs at least capable, if not quite 
brilliant, in traffic. We ordered the

We‚Äôve worked the Ram hard over

the rear-view camera really takes the

when towing, fuel economy fell to a

Some cars just make you feel smart. And this is one of those cars. e 2.0-liter 
turbo delivers nearly lag-free torque that belies the engine‚Äôs size, and the six-speed 
automatic praically predis your moves. It adds up to performance that‚Äôs more 
precise than exhilarating‚ÄîalmoÔ¨Ü cerebral, but in a good way. Inside the cabin, Audi 
has assembled one of the sharpeÔ¨Ü user interfaces. Audio, nav and climate controls 
are handled through the Multi Media Interface (MMI), a scroll-wheel/button combina-
tion that operates somewhat akin to a computer mouse. Once you get the hang of it, 
you can dial in radio Ô¨Üations or climate settings almoÔ¨Ü entirely by touch. We‚Äôve put 
over 10,000 miles on the Avant so far. Our Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü service was hassle-free, and, aside 
from a couple of Ô¨Çuky TPMS warnings, the vehicle has oÔ¨Äered zero headaches. Driven 
with reÔ¨Üraint, the Avant delivers good mileage. (But, like all turbos, it sucks fuel with 
abandon if you have too much fun.) And the wagon conÔ¨Åguration handles all the cargo 
you can throw at it, but Ô¨Üill feels sporty and looks sophiÔ¨Üicated.  ‚Äî JIM MEIGS

the 27-foot-long Israeli UAV is making a

tions. As each one sweeps overhead, an 
announcer gushes over its abilities with 
the over-enthusiasm of a county fair 
emcee describing a prize sheep. 
The crowd watches on the massive 
screen as the two boats converge and 
the Coast Guard crew completes the 
mock interception. The image of the 
river scene wheels as the Heron banks 
away from the boats and returns to the 
airÔ¨Åeld. The UAV glides into a smooth, 
autonomous landing and as the Heron 
taxis, the goofball emcee coos over the 
PA speakers: ‚ÄúAw, isn‚Äôt that just pretty?‚Äù
The day is a spectacle of Ô¨Çying robots. 
A unit of Textron shows off an aircraft 
that it is pitching to the Marine Corps. It 
has a 12-foot wingspan and a pusher 
propeller mounted between its fuselage 
and inverted V-tail; it can be launched 
from a moving vehicle and is recovered 
by Ô¨Çying it into a net. The U.S. Army also 
has a marquee UAV to demo, the MQ-8B 
Fire Scout. The 3150-pound unmanned 
helicopter, the Army‚Äôs first, may soon 
scan battleÔ¨Åelds for chemical weapons, 
minefields and radio transmissions. 
And the showstopper, even while 
remaining earthbound, is the Navy‚Äôs 
Joint Unmanned Combat Air System, a 
sleek, blended-wing aircraft with the 
maw of an air inlet placed almost mock-
ingly where a cockpit would go. It sits 
like a resting bird, its 31-foot-long wings 
folded up for better storage on a war-
ship. It is scheduled to perform an 
autonomous takeoff and landing from 
an aircraft carrier deck this year. 
With all the hardware and enthusias-
tic attendees, it‚Äôs easy to overlook a 
missing guest‚Äîthe U.S. Air Force. Of all 
the advanced aircraft on the Ô¨Çight line, 
none is being developed for Air Force 
programs or is controlled by the ser-
vice‚Äôs airmen. 
Unmanned aircraft are the biggest 
thing to happen in military aviation 
since stealth geometry, and the Air 
Force‚Äôs leadership is dramatically 
increasing the UAV Ô¨Çeet this year. How-
ever, the service is still struggling over 
how the technology can be maximized 
in the future. ‚ÄúToday, the evolution of 
the machine is beginning to outpace the 
capability of the people we put in them,‚Äù 
Air Force chief of staff Gen. Norton 
Schwartz said late last year in a speech 
to the Air Force Association. ‚ÄúWe now 
must reconsider the relationship.‚Äù
Under his direction, the Air Force is 
trying to become the Pentagon‚Äôs leader 
of future UAV development. Schwartz‚Äôs 
primary tool is the ‚ÄúUnmanned Aircraft 
Systems Flight Plan, 2009‚Äì2047,‚Äù a com-
prehensive look at how the U.S. military 
can expand the use of UAVs over the next 
38 years. The Air Force is proposing to 
use next-generation unmanned aircraft 
in a slate of new missions, including air 
strikes, aerial refueling, cargo transport 
and long-range bombing. 
But how much freedom will the Air 
Force be willing to grant unmanned air-
planes? Its airmen are only now coming 
to accept UAVs‚Äîthey Ô¨Çy them every day 
over Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of 
 Africa and other hot spots‚Äîbut the ser-
vice has articulated a way forward that 
not only marginalizes pilots, it also 
promises to replace many UAV ground-
control crews with automation. Today‚Äôs 
highly trained airmen may not embrace 
this vision of the future. One Air Force 
ofÔ¨Åcer working with unmanned aircraft 
would only say he supports the report 
‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs a plan. And having a plan is 
better than not having a plan.‚Äù 
MisÔ¨Åt Toys to Frontline Heroes
The Air Force squandered decades‚Äô 
worth of opportunities to lead U.S. mili-
tary UAV development. In the 1970s, the 
service experimented with unmanned 
surveillance craft in Vietnam but 
dropped all funding after it decided the 
technology did not offer improvements 
over traditional airplanes. Continued 
advances of Soviet warplanes, such as 
the MiG fighter, kept a Cold War 
premium on air superiority won by high-
performance, expertly piloted airplanes.
The idea of unmanned airplanes also 
runs contrary to the airman-centric 
ethos that has deÔ¨Åned the Air Force since 
it became an independent military 
branch in 1947. Aviation Week and Space 
Technology magazine in 1973 quoted an 
Air Force official‚Äôs disparaging verdict 
on remote-control warplanes: ‚ÄúHow can 
you be a tiger sitting behind a console?‚Äù 
That attitude proved to be shortsighted. 
In 1982, Israel used UAVs to spoof Syrian 
radar in Lebanon, but the status quo  
in America continued for another 
decade. The Pentagon started UAV 
research in the mid-1990s, but even then 
the funding was tepid, in part because of 
Washington‚Äôs bias toward large, job- 
generating manned airplane programs.
Guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan changed all that; the need for con-
stant overhead video is driving a UAV 
spending spree. When facing insurgents 
who blend into a local population, good 
intelligence is worth more than even the 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 
an overstatement 
that this is a 
revolution of 
military affairs. 
The revolution is 
the conscious 
application  
of automated 
technology.‚Äù

A box-wing UAV could fuel many

could be built to service UAVs.

When unmanned aircra can refuel one another, their time on a mission 
will be dramatically extended. e Air Force Research Laboratory is spend-
ing $49 million over the next four years to create a syÔ¨Üem that will allow 
UAVs to autonomously refuel in the air, as seen in this 2007 Predator teÔ¨Ü.

Col. Pete GerÔ¨Üen commands the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing at Creech Air Force Base, 
Nevada, the only wing dedicated to unmanned airplanes like the MQ-9 Reaper (shown). GerÔ¨Üen 
is eagerly seeking crews to operate UAVs, but isn‚Äôt ready to replace them with soware. 
smartest bomb. In 2010 the Defense 
Department will spend $5.4 billion on 
unmanned aircraft development, pro-
curement and operations‚Äîabout $2.5 
billion more than the military spent on 
UAVs during the 1990s. 
This boom is causing turf wars with-
in the Pentagon. Military branches sel-
dom develop weapons systems together, 
despite the potential savings of time and 
money if the services shared research 
costs and ordered hardware in bulk. The 
Air Force wants to coordinate UAV devel-
opment within the Pentagon and 
 drafted its ambitious Flight Plan to 
describe how the service would serve as 
the Pentagon‚Äôs chief guide to unmanned 
airplane development, in concert with 
the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. ‚ÄúThe 
Flight Plan is part of an Air Force effort 
to lay claim over everything that Ô¨Çies, 
whether it has a pilot or not,‚Äù says mili-
tary analyst and author Jim Dunnigan.
The Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
Task Force, which drafted the plan, is 
headquartered in a modest ofÔ¨Åce that 
takes up a small fraction of one floor 
inside a banal building in Crystal City, 
Va. The full-time staff here tops out at a 
handful, but National Guard and Air 
Force Reserve temps Ô¨Åll out the admin-
istrative positions. Dozens of moon-
lighting planners from the Pentagon 
also volunteer for the task force, forgo-
ing their free time for a chance to work 
on a project with high-ranking luminar-
ies at Air Force headquarters who advise 
the task force.
The day-to-day work is supervised by 
the task force‚Äôs director, Col. Eric 
Mathewson. The former F-15 pilot is a 
compact man with a soft, smooth voice 
that always sounds earnest. Mathewson 
often places a hand on his head when he 
speaks, as if his ideas could burst from 
his temple if he weren‚Äôt holding them 
in. ‚ÄúIt was clear we had been reactive, 
reactive, reactive,‚Äù Mathewson says. ‚ÄúIt 
was time to develop a vision.‚Äù
That vision depends on developing 
smarter unmanned aircraft that can 
make life-and-death combat decisions 
on their own. According to the Flight 
Plan, UAVs will demonstrate ‚Äúsense and 
avoid‚Äù collision-avoidance systems by 
the end of this year. Unmanned aircraft 
will be able to refuel each other by 2030. 
Global strike capability, perhaps even 
with nuclear weapons, is projected  
for 2047. ‚ÄúAs technology advances, 
machines will automatically perform 
some repairs in Ô¨Çight,‚Äù the Flight Plan 
reads. ‚ÄúRoutine ground maintenance 
will be conducted by machines without 
human touch labor.‚Äù The Air Force docu-
ment not only discusses once-taboo sub-
jects, such as automatic target engage-
ment and autonomous UAVs flying in 
commercial airspace, it also includes 
short-term recommendations and goals 
to one day make them feasible. 
Mathewson says that by 2020 just one 
control crew‚Äîairborne or ground-
based‚Äîwill be able to control multiple 
UAVs at once. Ground-control crews 
today, even when aided by advanced 
autopiloting, continuously monitor a 
single UAV. This level of direct control 
and supervision is referred to as man-in-
the-loop. But a robotic system that only 
alerts humans when a critical decision 
needs to be made is called man-on-the-
loop. A ground-control crew can opt to 
redirect the UAV or assume direct control 
until the key choice is made. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt 
think it‚Äôs an overstatement that this is a 
revolution of military affairs,‚Äù Mathew-
son says. ‚ÄúThe revolution is the conscious 
application of automated technology.‚Äù
Robot-Assisted Air Strike 
Man-on-the-loop controls could make a 
battleÔ¨Åeld look like this: An F-35A Light-
ning II Ô¨Åghter cuts through the night sky. 
The pilot‚Äôs mission is simple‚Äîdestroy 
an enemy bunker protected by a network 
of radar and antiaircraft missile batter-
ies. His three wingmen‚Äîone Ô¨Çying scant 
feet away,  another 150 miles ahead and 
the third preparing to cause a diversion 
far to the east‚Äîare following a meticu-
lous battle plan meant to defeat these 
defenses. Of the four aircraft in the strike 
group, only the F-35A has a cockpit; the 
rest are semiautonomous UAVs that the 
pilot must trust with his life. 
One of the most dangerous missions 
in military aviation is suppression of 
enemy air defenses, or SEAD. The lead 
UAV becomes bait as it Ô¨Çies into radar 
range of antiaircraft missile batteries. 
An icon on the F-35 pilot‚Äôs virtual head-
up display, projected onto the faceplate 
of his helmet, alerts him that the SEAD 
unmanned airplane has automatically 
identified the emissions of an enemy 
radar site. This is the Ô¨Årst time in the 
mission that the SEAD airplane has 
communicated with any human.

‚ÄúThe road map to 2047 
will likely be good for just 
a few years. But that‚Äôs all 
we need for it to make a 
big difference.‚Äù
Miles from the danger, the F-35A 
pilot coolly assesses the situation dis-
played on one of the screens in his cock-
pit, conÔ¨Årms the target is legitimate and 
authorizes the lead UAV to fire. The 
AGM-88 high-speed antiradiation mis-
sile follows the radar waves back to their 
source, obliterating the dish and its 
crew. There is now a gap in the enemy 
radar screen, and the pilot directs the 
UAV to return to base. 
Meanwhile, another UAV east of the 
target, navigating by using a mix of GPS 
and accelerometer data, is busy scram-
bling other enemy radar installations by 
Ô¨Çooding the skies with emissions that 
share the radar‚Äôs frequency. The jam-
ming pods under the UAV‚Äôs wings also 
disrupt radio transmissions from the 
air-defense network, covering up the 
sudden loss of contact with the radar 
sites protecting the bunker. Otherwise, 
an enemy commander could discover 
the location of the actual raid. After a 
preset amount of time spreading confu-
sion, the UAV returns to base.
The F-35A pilot is closing in on the 
target fast and needs to carefully aim the 
F-35‚Äôs electro-optical targeting system 
to release a bomb that will hit the struc-
ture at an angle calculated to collapse it 
without destroying nearby civilian build-
ings. He triggers the laser designator 
and authorizes the nearby unmanned 
airplane to drop a pair of bombs, which 
use Ô¨Åns to steer toward the laser-desig-
nated sweet spot. The pilot watches the 
twin, concurrent explosions, makes a 
quick battle-damage assessment and, 
satisÔ¨Åed, banks the airplane and heads 
back to base. His robotic wingman fol-
lows his lead, Ô¨Çying evenly at his side.
Skeptical Views From the Front
It can be hard to see the Flight Plan‚Äôs 
vision of autonomous Ô¨Çying robots from 
the human-intensive work being done at 
Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. The 
desert base is in the midst of an unprec-
edented boom as it hosts the fast- 
growing 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing, 
the only one dedicated solely to Ô¨Çying 
unmanned aircraft. Every aircraft and 
satellite-linked ground-control station 
here is being used to Ô¨Çy missions in the 
Middle East, the Horn of Africa and 
points beyond. New buildings fill up 
with staff as soon as the construction 
dust settles. ‚ÄúEvery time the fishbowl 
grows, the Ô¨Åsh get too big for it,‚Äù says 
Col. Pete Gersten, the 432nd‚Äôs com-
mander. Mathewson served at Creech as 
group commander before Gersten‚Äôs 
arrival, but their jobs now are pointed in 
opposite directions. As Gersten wrestles 
with recruiting ground-control crews, 
Mathewson promotes ways to replace 
the airmen with artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence. 
Every time an airman is replaced by a 
machine, the Air Force cuts the cost of 
health benefits, base upkeep and 
recruitment. Current unmanned sys-
tems require as many, if not more, peo-
ple to Ô¨Çy missions than piloted airplanes 
do. For example, it takes a crew of three 
to operate a Reaper, even while it‚Äôs on 
autopilot: one to Ô¨Çy, another to operate 
the sensor ball in its nose and a third to 
serve as military intelligence liaison. 
Another pair must deploy to the forward 
airÔ¨Åeld to guide the UAV, using line-of-
sight radio during takeoff and landing. 
By replacing these positions with auto-
mated functions, the cost of joystick 
operators could plummet.
But Gersten‚Äîwho calls his 
unmanned airplanes remotely piloted 
vehicles to emphasize the crews operat-
ing them‚Äîdoes not give up human con-
trol over the aircraft unless it provides a 
clear war-fighting edge. For example, 
the Flight Plan pegs autonomous take-
off and landing for the Reaper by the 
end of 2010, but Gersten is not begging 
for that ability. In fact, when faced with 
a rash of accidents during landings, Ger-
sten chose a solution to help, not 
replace, the joystick pilot.
The landing gear would collapse 
when Gersten‚Äôs UAVs bounced down the 
runway. Operators have a tough time 
Ô¨Ånding the correct pitch of the nose after 
A I R  W A R  2 0 2 5

P O P U L A R M EC H A N I C S . C O M   |   M A R C H  2 0 10 63
Even as the Air Force frantically expands its Ô¨Çeet of MQ-9 Reapers‚Äîhoping to Ô¨Åeld more than 
300 by the end of 2010‚Äîthe service is seeking a tougher, faÔ¨Üer and smarter successor. ‚ÄúWe 
are going to replace them before they fail,‚Äù says the wing commander in charge of the Reapers.
a UAV‚Äôs wheels bounce off the runway, 
causing oscillations that can destroy the 
aircraft on the third or fourth bounce. 
The seemingly obvious solution: Pro-
gram the machines to take over and land 
automatically‚Äîsomething the Army‚Äôs 
Sky Warrior, which is nearly identical to 
a Predator, already does. But Gersten 
 opted for a simpler Ô¨Åx, adding a triangu-
lar carrot icon on the flight-control 
screen that sets the correct pitch to pre-
vent the oscillation cycle from starting. 
This change will be made to ground- 
control stations this year, and he says 
‚Äúthe cost is minuscule.‚Äù
Gersten‚Äôs reaction to the Flight Plan 
is coolly receptive. (He rolls his eyes at 
the report‚Äôs language that suggests that 
UAVs one day could carry nuclear 
 weapons.) The lower ranks on the base 
are more frankly skeptical of autonomy. 
Senior Airman Jessie Grace, a sensor-
operator instructor at Creech, has spent 
wrist-aching hours keeping a UAV‚Äôs 
camera trained on a target vehicle or 
locking his tired eyes on display screens 
to catch subtle signs of insurgent activ-
ity. While he does say that pilots could 
control more than one airplane at once, 
Grace sees things differently when it 
comes to his specialty. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine a 
computer doing intelligence, surveil-
lance and reconnaissance better than a 
person,‚Äù he says. 
Mathewson lists battleÔ¨Åeld demands 
as the biggest hindrance to the Flight 
Plan, but he notes inÔ¨Çexible attitudes as 
another roadblock. ‚ÄúYou see a cultural 
resistance,‚Äù Mathewson says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 
same thing with the horse cavalry dur-
ing the introduction of the tank.‚Äù
Programmed Killer Instincts 
Until the Flight Plan, it was nearly 
impossible to Ô¨Ånd ofÔ¨Åcials who would 
even discuss the possibility of 
unmanned airplanes firing their 
weapons without human permission. 
But the report states that by 2030, Ô¨Çying 
robots could be programmed with 
‚Äúautomatic target engagement‚Äù abili-
ties. A UAV would open Ô¨Åre only after 
clearing a checklist of technical details 
from its sensors‚Äîits preset rules of 
engagement. Such a system would be an 
heir to ones currently used in Patriot 
antiaircraft batteries and some antimis-
sile weapons on Navy ships. The legacy 
of the Patriot is mixed. During the sec-
ond Gulf War, the system downed a pair 
of friendly airplanes, killing one Ameri-
can and two British pilots, after mistak-
ing the planes for enemy missiles. Many 
military ofÔ¨Åcials faulted an over-reliance 
on automation, but think-tank analysts 
noted that a lack of training caused the 
dependence and was the root cause of 
the tragedies.
Mathewson says that keeping people 
directly involved at the end of the kill 
chain is optional but preferred. ‚ÄúThere 
are not that many cases where you‚Äôll 
have free Ô¨Åre, where you‚Äôre going to have 
the system completely automated,‚Äù he 
says. ‚ÄúIf you look at the way we employ 
unmanned aircraft in the current Ô¨Åghts, 
the rules of engagement require that 
someone [in charge at the rear]  has to 
approve it, to say, ‚ÄòYes, indeed, you‚Äôre 
cleared hot‚Äô for every single case. And 
that would hold true.‚Äù
While Gersten normally keeps any 
pride in check, the former F-16 pilot can 
be moralistic in arguing to have a man 
at the helm of a system that can bring 
death to its targets. ‚ÄúWarfare should be 
humanistic,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHuman value 
requires a human interface.‚Äù It‚Äôs his way 
of saying that even sworn enemies 
deserve to have an actual person, rather 
than an algorithm, make the decision to 
kill them.

1. D Concrete doesn‚Äôt dry‚Äîit cures via 
a chemical reaction between cement 
and water. e reaction takes place over 
Ô¨Åve to seven days, during which time it‚Äôs 
critical to keep the fresh pour covered 
and moist. Stake a tarp over the patio 
and mist the slab once every 24 hours.
2. B Air pressure recommendations 
appear on the driver‚Äôs side doorsill or in 
the owners‚Äô manual, not here. e only 
psi number on the tire is the maximum 
air pressure‚Äînot a recommended level. 
3. D Second step down from the cap.
4. D Increasing the tire pressure 
reduces the rolling resistance. Going 
easy on the gas provides an eÔ¨Écient 
throttle input. And a/c requires engine 
power to run, reducing fuel economy.  
5. D Hacking at an old gutter with a 
moving reciprocating-saw blade just 
might knock you oÔ¨Ä a ladder. Instead, 
wedge the saw‚Äôs blade and shoe Ô¨Årmly 
against the material before pulling the 
trigger. Get the other saws‚Äô blades 
spinning at full speed before carefully 
making contact with the workpiece.
6. B Window sash-weight chains‚Äô 
Ô¨Çexible links and low he make them 
ideal to snake wires down stud bays.
7. C Polyurethane insulation materials 
typically have an R-value of about 7.0 to 
8.0 per inch, and rigid polyurethane 
panels with foil facings can get up to 8.7 
per inch. With an R-value of 3.0 to 3.8, 
loose-Ô¨Åll cellulose ranks near Ô¨Åberglass 
batts. Same goes for shredded blue 
jeans, with a 3.4 to 3.7 R-value, and for 
mineral wool, about 3.7. 
8. B Ball-peen hammer. e 
ball-peen‚Äîand not your old carpenter‚Äôs 
framing hammer‚Äîis appropriate for 
striking chisels, punches and other 
hardened metal. Use soer faces like 
lead or brass for delicate work.
9. C Hickory is the hardest here, falling 
in at 1820 on the Janka hardness scale. 
Cherry is at 950, bamboo measures 
1380, and maple scores 1450.
10. A e 15-degree nozzle‚Äôs narrow 
spray can cut caked mud oÔ¨Ä the 
lawnmower and strip weak paint from 
brick. e wider, gentler, 60-degree spray 
can apply mixtures of cleaning chemicals 
and water to weathered decks and 
wood siding.
11. C Acrylic paints are superior to 
alkyds‚Äîexcept on exterior ironwork. 
Scrape away loose paint and rust, apply 
a Ô¨Åsh-oil-based primer, and clean with 
mineral spirits.
12. C Overdoing mulch actually 
stresses the plant‚Äîpile it 2 to 4 inches 
high, and avoid burying the plant‚Äôs root 
stem. Apply mulch in cool late spring to 
give the plant‚Äôs roots insulation against 
the Ô¨Årst hot sunshine.
13. B e problem with those cheap 
lug wrenches is that the short handle 
gives the user little leverage. e pipe 
extends the handle and increases the 
user‚Äôs mechanical advantage over the 
nut the wrench is turning.
14. B Carbon-steel brushes like this 
one work on ferrous metals, but can 
introduce rust and contamination to 
stainless steel.
15. C At up to 11.3 cfm at 90 psi, the 
orbital sander‚Äôs continuous draw may 
overtax this machine during extended 
periods of use. e compressor can 
handle the 3‚ÅÑ8-inch impact wrench (2.5 to 
3.5 cfm at 90 psi), the framing nailer (2.2 
to 5.0 cfm at 90 psi) and brad nailers 
(0.3 cfm to 1.3 cfm at 90 psi). 
16. C Dutchman repairs oen stand 
in contrast to the surrounding Ô¨Çooring, 
and on historic Ô¨Çoors exposed to years 
of wear, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see 
several such patches. e aesthetic is so 
distinct that some engineered Ô¨Çooring 
manufacturers have built faux Dutchman 
repairs into the Ô¨Ånished product when 
replicating historic styles.
17. B Connect one end of the positive 
(red) cable to the positive (+) terminal on 
the battery of the dead car, then repeat 
for the booster car. Connect one end of 
the negative (black) cable to the negative 
(‚Äì) terminal on the booster battery. en 
connect the other end of the negative 
(black) cable to a clean, unpainted metal 
surface (such as the engine block) on the 
engine of the disabled vehicle. 
18. A According to Quikrete‚Äôs Build 
and Repair With Concrete (the edition 
with a sneering, troweling Don Knotts 
on the cover), the diameter of a 
posthole should be roughly three times 
the post diameter. Hole depth should be 
one-third the overall post length. Ergo, 
drop this 12-foot 4 x 4 in a hole 1 foot 
wide and 4 feet deep, leaving 8 feet of 
tether post exposed.
19. D e 8-inch nominal dimension 
actually measures at 71‚ÅÑ4 inches. e 
diÔ¨Äerence occurs because the nominal 
dimensions typically refer to rough 
lumber, the size of which declines as the 
boards are planed and dried.
20. A File card.
21. C e cement will begin setting 
immediately, so have each end primed 
and ready before beginning the cement 
slather. PVC is easy to glue‚Äîno Ô¨Çame, 
no Ô¨Çux‚Äîbut don‚Äôt dawdle.
22. C Both the turbo- and 
supercharger are pumps that force more 
air into the engine. Increased air adds 
oxygen to the intake charge, producing 
more power. Turbos have a compressor 
and turbine wheel connected by a 
sha‚Äîthe exhaust gases spin the 
turbine, which drives the compressor. 
Superchargers, however, have only a 
compressor, which is powered by some 
connection to the crank, usually a belt.
23. D Not only are choices A  
through C oÔ¨Ä-limits, but if that outlet 
doesn‚Äôt have the third grounding 
connection, code states that you can‚Äôt 
even grind oÔ¨Ä the cord‚Äôs third prong. 
Install a new outlet. And use rope to 
wrangle dead wood. 
24. D Modern engines typically 
outlast the rest of the car as long as the 
manufacturer‚Äôs service schedule is 
followed. So do what the book says, but 
remember: Commuting in stop-and-go 
traÔ¨Éc is considered ‚Äúsevere‚Äù duty. 
25. A e pickle fork‚Äôs forged tines 
will separate the tie rod ends from  
the suspension, either by hammering 
the handle or attaching the handle to 
an air hammer.
26. A Load-bearing walls in the 
central part of the house run 
perpendicular to the joists. Exterior walls 
and most stair walls are also 
load-bearing.
27. B Neutral wires are white.
28. C Couplings continue a straight 
run in pipe or tubing, joining pipes of like 
sizes or, with a reducer coupling, mating 
two diÔ¨Äerent diameters.
29. B Sixteen inches.
30. D e multi-monikered hand tool 
is critical when installing interior trim. 
Measure the angle between two walls by 
pressing each leg against the wall 
surfaces, lock in the setting, then 
transcribe the Ô¨Åndings to the miter saw 
and cut the trim.
31. C Depending on the belt, the 
signs of old age include surface 
cracking‚Äîthink of the surface of a dry 
lakebed‚Äîand fraying like an unraveling 
sweater. Modern serpentine belts should 
last 10 years and 100,000 miles.
32. D e mullion is a vertical 
member separating two casement 
windows, the tympanum is the recessed 
triangular face of a pediment, the 
festoon is a decorative fruit or Ô¨Çoral 
carving oen found on a frieze, and the 
nasturtium is an edible Ô¨Çower.
33. A Using a roll-pin punch that‚Äôs too 
small will Ô¨Çare the end of the pin and 
make it even harder to move. e metal 
in the pin is so hard that it‚Äôll only melt 
the drill bit. e right punch is nearly as 
big as the pin. With the punch‚Äôs dimpled 
end centered on the pin, smack the tool 
smartly with a ball-peen hammer to drive 
the roll pin out.
34. B For Soss hinges, use a Forstner 
sized 13‚ÅÑ8 inch, or 35 mm.
35. D e blade to cut Ô¨Åber cement 
has a tooth geometry unlike the serrated 
edge of a woodcutting blade. Instead, it 
only contains about four or Ô¨Åve teeth, 
oen made of a high-density carbide and 
capped with a nonstick coating. 
Woodcutting blades are perfect for OSB 
and MDF, and they‚Äôre passable for PVC.
36. D Ripsaws work like a series of 
chisels to scoop out material in line with 
the woodgrain. Crosscut saws sever the 
wood Ô¨Åbers at each edge of the blade, 
then the saw teeth scoop out the 
sawdust in the saw blade‚Äôs channel, or 
kerf. On a 2 x 4, the crosscut saw works 
across the short side, while the ripsaw 
cuts along the board‚Äôs length.
37. C Tightening the lug nut 
fractionally, with a torque wrench, 
lengthens the wheel stud. is maintains 
the proper clamp force on the wheel. 
Overtighten the nut (likely with a 
pneumatic wrench) and you risk 
exceeding the bolt‚Äôs yield point, which 
weakens the metal. Too loose, and the 
wheel could fall oÔ¨Ä.  FC

When giant tankers need guidance getting in and out of port, captains call on the world‚Äôs most 
By Carl Hoffman  
The Methane Princess is inbound, and she‚Äôs not to be triÔ¨Çed with. 
She‚Äôs 909 feet long and 142 feet wide, draws 33 feet and is loaded 
with liqueÔ¨Åed natural gas (LNG). The 94,000-ton vessel is per-
ceived as a giant Ô¨Çoating bomb, and at slow speeds, within the 
conÔ¨Ånes of crowded shipping channels and ports, there‚Äôs simply 
not enough water passing over her rudder to maintain steerage. 
She might as well be adrift. Which is why, on this muggy, overcast 
September afternoon, the tractor tugboat Edward J. Moran is

powerful tugs to steer them straight.

In a mismatched tango, a tug prepares to escort the Methane Princess down the Savannah River and out to sea. 

churning down the Savannah River, headed 8 miles 
into the Atlantic off the Georgia coast to meet the Prin-
cess and escort her to the Elba Island LNG terminal, 
5 miles east of Savannah. And why the Edward and her 
sister ship Bulldog, owned by another company and 
heading out with us, are tasked with the job: They are 
the most powerful, sophisticated tugs in the United 
States. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got the strength of a center in the NFL,‚Äù 
David Missroon, the Edward‚Äôs captain, says of his ves-
sel, ‚Äúwith the speed and agility of a defensive end.‚Äù
Up in the pilothouse, Missroon is sitting in a Kirk-
like Star Trek chair, each forearm resting on a console, 
each hand holding a Ô¨Åst-size joystick knob. Missroon 
Ô¨Çicks his wrists. The ship pitches forward‚Äîthe force is 
strong enough to send me to the deck, but I‚Äôm holding 
on with both hands. Almost as quickly, the tug comes 
to a dead stop and then lurches backward. I‚Äôve been 
around the water my whole life, and I‚Äôve never seen a 
vessel move the way the Edward moves, much less one 
98 feet long and packing 6500 hp: She can go from 
13 knots forward to 13 knots in reverse in 15 seconds. 
Another twist of the joysticks and the ship pivots 360 
degrees within her own length.
The reason for all this power and agility is simple. 
To convince a skittish public of the safety of transport-
ing LNG, the Coast Guard and the LNG industry are 
building a Ô¨Çeet of tugs that are able to maintain abso-
lute control over the tankers in port at all times. 
When we exit the river and head into 
the ocean, the swells pick up, and 6-foot waves, driven 
by winds gusting to 30 knots, crash over the pilot-
house. It‚Äôs a long, rough slog out to the Princess, which 
Ô¨Ånally looms into view‚Äîa British-registered, black-
hulled steel monolith that left Egypt 12 days ago. 
We slide up against the hull in the ship‚Äôs lee, and 
Rodney Magwood, the docking pilot, climbs the gang-
way and disappears inside the tanker. We maneuver to 
the stern, the bow hard against steel, and deckhand 
David Krokoski tosses up a light line connected to our 
tow rope, a 9¬Ω-inch braid of Kevlar with a million 
pounds of breaking strength. We ease back 200 feet 
into what‚Äôs known as the in-line position and match 
the Princess‚Äôs speed of 9 knots. From here on, the 
tanker will remain tethered until she‚Äôs back out at sea.
It takes 2 hours for the Edward to reach the river‚Äôs 
mouth. The tug has four crewmen: a captain, a mate, a 
deckhand and an engineer, and they work a week on 
and a week off, on standby 24 hours a day for LNG work 
and whatever else the port throws their way, from 
docking container ships to rescuing disabled vessels 
at sea. Missroon is a third-generation Savannah River 
tug sailor. His mate, Anthony Groover, 25, is the son of 
a docking pilot who was trained by Missroon‚Äôs father 
and who in turn trained Missroon. ‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, I 
spent nights on the tugboat with my father,‚Äù Missroon 
says, ‚Äúand my life has mirrored his. He wanted me to 
go to the University of Georgia, but he died in a car 
accident when I was a senior in high school. I changed 
my plans and came to the water.‚Äù He adjusts the vol-
ume of a John Mellencamp song playing on the radio. 
‚ÄúMy son wants to do the same. He‚Äôs spent lots of time 
on the boat, and it‚Äôs in his blood, just like me.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs late afternoon when the Edward and the Princess,
now under escort by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter and 
two Coast Guard rigid-hull inÔ¨Çatable boats, close in on 
the LNG terminal, a long concrete pier parallel to the 
shore. These terminals have long been controversial, 
but all LNG tankers are double-hulled, and during 
33,000 voyages over the past 30 years there have been 
only eight leaks‚Äînone of them resulting in Ô¨Åres. LNG 
won‚Äôt burn unless it becomes a vapor and dissolves into 
the air at a concentration of 5 to 15 percent. The worst 
accident occurred in 1944 in Cleveland at the world‚Äôs 
first commercial LNG plant, when a tank failed and 
spilled its entire contents into creeks and sewers. When 
the air‚Äìgas concentrations were right, the vapor caught 
Ô¨Åre, killing 128 and injuring 225. Since then there have 
been four accidents worldwide that resulted in fatali-
ties, all at plants. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want any chain in the pro-
cess to be weak,‚Äù says David Beardsley, vice president of 
construction and repair for Moran.
We‚Äôre traveling at 9 knots, and it‚Äôs time to slow 
down. From here on, Magwood, the docking pilot on 
the Princess‚Äôs bridge, calls the shots. ‚ÄúHalf ahead, 
transverse,‚Äù he says over the radio.
‚ÄúHalf ahead,‚Äù replies Groover, now at the Edward‚Äôs 
con, as he pivots the joysticks inward, rotating the 
screws so they‚Äôre facing away from each other, a maneu-
ver that acts as a brake and is known as a transverse 
arrest. The Edward shudders violently‚Äîit feels as 
though we‚Äôre bumping over a washboard dirt road. The 
meter registering the load on the Edward‚Äôs line shows 
54 tons. The Edward slows to 8 knots, as the Bulldog
swings round to the Princess‚Äôs bow. At 7 knots, Groover 
shifts to starboard. When the Edward, straining and 
digging, slowly pulls the Methane Princess‚Äôs stern 
around, 94 tons register on the line.
‚ÄúFive-point-eight and backing,‚Äù Groover says.
The Edward‚Äôs bow is pushed down, its stern lifted 
up; it shudders as it backs against the strain.
Bit by bit over the next half-hour, we slow the Prin-
cess down to 4 knots. Two more tugs join us, the Bull-
dog ‚Äúend on‚Äù‚Äîbow forward and perpendicular to the

water power
For nearly 200 years tugboats have 
butted, towed and nudged big ships in 
American harbors. But handling the 
current maritime Ô¨Çeet of mammoth 
vessels calls for greater speed, agility, 
safety and power. Here‚Äôs the hardware 
that gets the job done.

Fire-Suppression
System
To douse Ô¨Åres, the 
Edward J. Moran, 
piured here, calls 
on the moÔ¨Ü 
powerful Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting 
capacity aÔ¨Çoat. Twin 
900-hp pumps pull 
water through 
12-inch risers to a 
pair of 360-degree 
nozzles that the 
crew controls 
remotely from the 
pilothouse. e Ô¨Çow 
rate: 11,800 gallons 
of water per minute.
easy.‚Äù The process is precise and slow, a nudge here, a 
pull there, four tugs and the Princess‚Äîfour captains 
and docking pilots, Ô¨Åve individual powerplants‚Äîall 
working in concert. 
‚ÄúStronger stern tugs, stronger,‚Äù Magwood com-
mands. ‚ÄúEasy astern, easy. Stop, Edward. In position.‚Äù
Groover smiles. ‚ÄúWe just put it within 1 foot of 
where he wanted it. Hey, Rodney, nice job!‚Äù
When the Princess is safely tied up, the Edward and 
the Bulldog lie a few hundred feet away; they stand by 
for the next 24 hours of unloading. The two older tugs 
return to Moran‚Äôs dock in downtown Savannah. John 
ship‚Äîagainst the Princess‚Äôs bow and two older Moran 
tugs amidships. The berth is now about 100 yards 
ahead. As Magwood guides the behemoth in, a dance 
based on years of experience and intuitive knowledge 
between docking pilot and tugs commences. ‚ÄúEdward, 
take me on down again,‚Äù Magwood says.
‚ÄúRoger, take you down,‚Äù Groover says.
‚ÄúEasy, Dog, easy,‚Äù Magwood says.
Over the next 45 minutes, the closer we get to the 
dock, the faster the commands come.
‚ÄúEasy does it on the Edward,‚Äù Magwood says. 
‚ÄúThirty percent on the Dog. Easy on the stern tugs,

Swiveling Twin Propellers
Twin screws known as Z-drives extend from the bottom of 
the hull like room fans and rotate 360 degrees, enabling 
tugs to go from a top speed of 14 knots to zero within a 
boatlength and to move forward while turned sideways.

Johnson emerges from the engine room, and the smell 
of his homemade enchiladas soon Ô¨Ålls the galley below 
the pilothouse. The galley is better equipped than my 
kitchen at home, with a full-size stainless-steel fridge 
and oven. ‚ÄúWe all love to cook,‚Äù Ô¨Årst mate Groover says. 
‚ÄúNothing comes out of a box.‚Äù 
Out here on the water, as the sun dips below the 
river‚Äôs green banks, it‚Äôs easy to see why generations of 
men have plied the tugboat trade. The river is serene, 
ever-changing. The crewmen are removed from the 
world but also connected to it in a way merchant sea-
men in the open ocean never are. With such small 
crews, even deckhands get a chance at every job. And 
though they‚Äôre on board for a week at a time, they 
remain in home port, and modern conveniences make 
the job less lonely‚Äîcellphones connect to friends and 
family, and Ô¨Çat-screen TVs in the galley and cabins and 
Wi-Fi keep the world at hand.
Late the next afternoon, it‚Äôs hot, bright and blue, 
and the Princess is empty, ready to disembark. The 
Bulldog noses into the tanker‚Äôs starboard bow and ties 
on. The Edward latches to her stern behind 267 feet of 
line, and another Moran tug ties on amidships. 
‚ÄúEasy on the Dog,‚Äù calls Magwood, once again direct-
ing from the bridge of the Princess. The Bulldog
responds with one long whistle and three short. Before 
two-way radios, tugs and pilots communicated by whis-
tle; most captains still prefer it. One whistle acknowl-
edges the request, three whistles means easy, and four 
means hooked up, slang for full ahead or astern.
‚ÄúStop, Dog, stop.‚Äù 
One whistle.
‚ÄúStraight out on Edward, straight out. Stop the Dog, 
stop. All stop.‚Äù
The Edward‚Äôs engines throb, the river churns and 
foams, and the rope strains. The Methane Princess
begins to slide away from the terminal and 
into the channel at the stately speed of 
1 knot. The tanker is the length of a city 
block, and such an enormous mass has an 
inertia that is hard to grasp, yet the tug-
boats move it with choreographed preci-
sion and few words.
We drift backward a bit, and Magwood 
calls, ‚ÄúStronger, Edward, stronger.‚Äù
One long whistle, two short.  
‚ÄúOkay, right on up the river, Edward. 
Easy, easy, Dog, easy!‚Äù
We power backward. The Bulldog pushes 
on the bow, and the Edward navigates to 
almost 90 degrees astern of the Princess, 
shuddering and thrumming and vibrating. 
The Edward‚Äôs bow digs into the river, and 
the stern tilts up, swinging the tanker 
around, slowly, slowly, until she‚Äôs pointing 
downriver.
‚ÄúStop, Edward, stop.‚Äù 
A churning swirl of water begins under 
the stern of the Princess as she goes to full ahead. 
‚ÄúEdward, full ahead, and home we go!‚Äù
It‚Äôs night by the time we drop off the 
Princess 8 miles out, pick up the pilot Magwood and 
re-enter the river. A high, full moon lights a shimmer-
ing path over the water. It‚Äôs quiet and dark in the pilot-
house, the glow of gauges and computer screens soft 
and comforting in a cocoon of utility and purpose 
that‚Äôs removed from the trafÔ¨Åc and lights and restau-
rants of pulsing Savannah, so near but so apart. 
In the anonymity of darkness, the stories of men 
who work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to keep it all 
going unspool. Of pressing and holding steel con-
tainer ships and tankers to the docks in hurricanes 
and 60-knot winds. Of times in waves and winds when 
tugs had to venture out to sea to Ô¨Ånd disabled ships 
and bring them safely to port. Of the pride of sons join-
ing their fathers on the water to do gratifying work 
that‚Äôs about steel and horsepower amid dynamic waves 
and currents and wind. Of shared experience and no 
nagging existential angst about why are we here and 
what are we doing.
The ship thrums under our feet. It‚Äôs 10 pm, the 
dock is near, and the lights of Savannah burn bright, 
lighting up the horizon. The men on the Edward are 
like those in coal mines and on deep-sea oil rigs‚Äî
they‚Äôre the wizards of Oz, the men behind the curtain, 
unseen and unheard for the most part, but vital to 
everything we take for granted. 
Before we bump gently against Moran‚Äôs dock in the 
moist night, Groover and Krokoski are throwing lines 
and spraying down. As I step off the tug, I hear whistles 
tooting somewhere out there, over the river. One long, 
three short. An answer. Now I know what they mean, 
and they‚Äôll be singing all night long.

OLYMPIC SKIERS SUBJECT THEIR BODIES to as much as 3.5 g‚Äôs‚Äîmore than 
space shuttle astronauts endure during launch‚Äîand to velocities that would earn 
them speeding tickets in most states. And when steep sections of a run Ô¨Çatten out, it 
takes a world-class athlete to stay upright despite the downward inertia. ‚ÄúA lot of us 
can leg-press 900 pounds, but that‚Äôs easy compared to this race,‚Äù says Ted Ligety, a 
Park City, Utah, native and reigning Olympic gold medalist in the combined skiing 
event, which is based on the total time from one downhill and two slalom runs. 
For the 2010 Olympics, Ligety is focusing on the slalom and giant slalom events. 
The slalom course is 2507 feet long, with 65 gates and a vertical drop of 722 feet. 
The giant slalom event has about 10 fewer gates in a course of more than twice the 
length (5256 feet) and vertical drop (1476 feet). Both events demand that athletes 
master a high-speed onslaught of gravity, friction and inertia.
qq
Alpine skiers‚Äô knees 
suÔ¨Üain about 110 
-lb of lateral 
torque during turns 
and nearly 300 
pounds of total 
force at the 
joint‚ÄîalmoÔ¨Ü as 
much torque as can 
be found in the 
engines of a ski 
resort‚Äôs snow-
removal trucks. 
qq
Ligety‚Äôs Rossignols 
are made of a 
wood, Ô¨Åberglass 
and metal laminate. 
Shorter skis enable 
competitors to 
make quicker turns; 
longer skis 
generate more 
speed. Minimum 
lengths: 165 cm for 
the turn-Ô¨Ålled 
slalom; 185 cm for 
the giant slalom.
qqq
For the men‚Äôs giant 
slalom, the gradient 
peaks at nearly  
40 degrees on the 
Dave Murray 
Downhill Course at 
WhiÔ¨Üler Mountain 
(above). Skiers 
carve blind turns at 
50 mph and Ô¨Çy 
down Ô¨Üraight-
aways at up to  
90 mph.
q
Skiers generate 
enough g‚Äôs in  
turns to make a 
180-pound 
athlete‚Äîlike 
Ligety‚Äîfeel like he 
weighs more than 
600 pounds. Steep 
angulation of the 
legs and an upright 
torso generate 
greater energy and 
speed coming out 
of the gates.

WHEN A PLAYER BLASTS a slap shot 30 feet from the net 
with 125 pounds of force, the goalie has less than 200 milli-
seconds to react to the Ô¨Çying 3-inch-wide, 1-inch-thick puck. 
‚ÄúThe physics of it are astounding‚Äîeven to me,‚Äù says U.S. 
team hopeful David Backes, a forward on the St. Louis Blues.
COMPETING IN THE BIATHLON requires both endurance 
and world-class shooting skills. Athletes must ski 20 kilo-
meters with a riÔ¨Çe and stop four times to shoot at targets, 
alternating prone and standing positions. The .22-caliber 
riÔ¨Çes have no optical sights, and missing a target can mean 
skiing a 150-meter penalty loop. Former U.S. team member 
Shaun Marshall-Pryde once compared the event to ‚Äúclimbing 
25 Ô¨Çights of stairs and then threading a needle Ô¨Åve times 
without missing the hole.‚Äù Success requires tremendous 
conditioning: Within seconds of arriving at the ranges, ath-
letes must bring their heart rate down by about 20 beats per 
minute in order to shoot with a steady hand.

LAMINATED FOAM SKI JUMPSUITS are one of the 
sports world‚Äôs most tightly regulated pieces of 
equipment. The reason: Even small tweaks to surface 
area can add lots of lift. ‚ÄúPeople were tinkering with 
the suits and Ô¨Çying like bats,‚Äù says Troy Flanagan of 
the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association. So the 
International Ski Federation standardized the gear. 
Suits can now be no more than 5 mm thick; the 
underwear, 3 mm. And, since airtight suits function as 
sails, the rules require materials that allow 40 liters of 
air per square meter to Ô¨Çow through them per second.

qSliding 42 Pounds of Granite
In curling, teams slide 42-pound granite stones down an ice 
sheet toward a target. On dry surfaces, the front of a spinning 
sphere generates more friction than the back, and the sphere 
veers in a direction different from that of the rotational vector. 
On ice, the opposite is true: A liquid layer reduces frontward 
friction, and the stone spins and slides in the same direction. 
This is where the sweepers get involved. Two players use 
brooms to scrub the ice ahead of the stone, enhancing the liq-
uid Ô¨Ålm in order to adjust curl (how much the stone veers to 
either side) and the length. The U.S. squad‚Äôs tests have shown 
that sweepers can ‚Äúdrag‚Äù a stone up to 16 extra feet.

qFlying 450 Feet
MORE THAN JUST SHUFFLEBOARD ON ICE, curling is also one of the fastest-
growing Winter Olympic sports in the U.S., and a marvel of physics.
Every ice surface plays 
slightly differently, and 
even the crowd at 
Vancouver‚Äôs new 5600-seat 
curling arena will affect 
shots. ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs packed, 
there will be more heat in 
the building, and the  
ice could get softer  
and slower.‚Äù

IN 1992, FORMER DAYTONA 500 CHAMPION Geoff Bodine 
dedicated himself to rebuilding American bobsledding. With 
the help of car designer Bob Cuneo, he formed the Bo-Dyn 
Bobsled Project and began building custom sleds to replace 
the retread imports the U.S. had been using. ‚ÄúNow the Italians 
are working with Ferrari; the British have McLaren; the Swiss 
have gone to Audi,‚Äù Cuneo says. ‚ÄúBut we were the Ô¨Årst team to 
acknowledge the crossover between race cars and bobsleds.‚Äù 
Bo-Dyn engineers have spent nearly two decades improving 
the suspension, streamlining the sled body and studying 
metallurgy for the steel runners. The payoff: The U.S. team 
won its Ô¨Årst world championship in 50 years last February. 
Ultimately, Cuneo estimates that about a third of the team‚Äôs 
success in Vancouver comes down to engineering.

designs that are opening up a whole new world of angling. 
Unconventional kayak designs allow adventurers to pedal to remote locations‚Äîand Ô¨Åsh two-handed.

fast and efÔ¨Åcient yet squirrely for all 
but experienced paddlers. 
Not so with Ô¨Åshing kayaks. Wider 
and far more stable than traditional 
sea kayaks, they are easy to paddle solo 
and can handle breaking waves and 
open water. And they‚Äôre tough enough 
to drag across the driveway and light 
enough to load on a roof rack. My kayak 
is a comfortable sit-on-top. Instead of a 
conÔ¨Åning cockpit, it has a self-bailing 
hull with a padded seat that‚Äôs as easy to 
get in and out of as a lounge chair. 
These new Ô¨Åshing-friendly designs 
have ushered in a golden age of 
small-craft angling. According to the 
Paddlesports Industry Association, 
kayak Ô¨Åshing is the fastest growing 
segment of human-powered water 
recreation. These boats are introducing 
outdoor enthusiasts who might never 
have considered themselves paddlers to 
a new kind of Ô¨Åshing adventure. 
During my three-day deep South 
blitz, I sample saltwater ponds just a few 
feet from highways and back-country 
marshes so vast that I signal the other 
anglers in our group by waving my 
paddle high above the reeds. At one 
point, my host, Jon Deichert Jr., pulls 
out an iPhone and uses Google Earth to 
Ô¨Ågure out which labyrinthine marsh 
creek leads to his favorite honey hole. 
Deichert, a southeast Louisiana 
carpenter and president of the Bayou 
Coast Kayak Fishing Club (BCKFC), 
and his pals preach the allure of kayak 
Ô¨Åshing. ‚ÄúI used to Ô¨Åsh from motor-
boats like everybody else,‚Äù Deichert 
says, leaning over the side of his kayak 
to grab a 16-inch-long redÔ¨Åsh. ‚ÄúOnce 
I got into a kayak, that was it. I‚Äôve 
paddled right up to river otters, ducks 
and wading birds. I go places I‚Äôd never 
go in a powerboat. There‚Äôs less hassle, 
and I don‚Äôt have to spend a hundred 
bucks on gas just to catch a Ô¨Åsh.‚Äù
Deichert‚Äôs crew has brought along 
a wide assortment of boats. A few of 
the sit-on-tops differ little from 
e author, Ô¨Åghting a redÔ¨Åsh, reaches for his pliers‚Äî
a feat that is tricky in traditional paddled kayaks. 
Sitting  
sideways in  
a kayak, I cast a plug into  
the inky-black dark of a south  
Louisiana salt marsh. It‚Äôs a half- 
hour to sunrise, but I‚Äôm already a mile 
out after following Ô¨Åve other kayak 
anglers to a tiny island set deep in the 
wetlands. Now we‚Äôre catching spotted 
sea trout as fast as we can cast. All 
around me I hear lures plopping into 
the water and my fellow anglers whoop-
ing and hooting.
‚ÄúWhatcha doing over there, Top 
Dog?‚Äù The voice rings out from the far 
side of the island. 
‚ÄúFilling up the boat, Choupique!‚Äù
Suddenly, my rod bends deep. This 
is no 12-inch trout; I can feel the Ô¨Åsh all 
the way into the cork handle. As I 
scramble to my feet to put pressure on 
the line, the kayak holds steady. It‚Äôs a 
crazy notion: If I tried to stand in a 
traditional kayak, I‚Äôd be picking marsh 
muck from my teeth. But my kayak is a 
new breed, designed from bow to stern 
to maximize Ô¨Åshability. 
For centuries, Inuit paddled 
one-person sealskin craft in pursuit of 
halibut, salmon and bottom-dwelling 
rockÔ¨Åsh. Modern sea kayaks have 
followed those ancestral lines‚Äî 
narrow, cigar-shaped boats that are

ANCHOR
The most extreme 
kayak angler may 
be Chicago futures 
and options trader 
Dave Lamoureux, 
who paddles a 
modiÔ¨Åed 12-foot-
long recreational 
kayak off the tip of 
Cape Cod in pursuit 
of blueÔ¨Ån tuna. He‚Äôs 
had strikes powerful 
enough to tow  
him at 15 mph‚Äî 
a contemporary 
variation of a whale 
pulling a whaling 
boat in what 
Herman Melville 
described as a 
Nantucket sleigh 
ride. In November 
Lamoureux reeled 
in his biggest  
catch to date‚Äî 
a 157-pound blueÔ¨Ån 
(at right). ‚ÄúTuna are 
so big and fast,‚Äù  
he says, ‚Äúthe initial 
hit is extremely 
violent. I‚Äôve had my 
kayak cracked.‚Äù 
tournament director. ‚ÄúMaybe personal 
Ô¨Åshing craft comes closer to the idea.‚Äù 
But not every kayak angler goes for 
the slick new bells and whistles from 
the R&D departments of boat manufac-
turers. Joe Barbier, who trades rigging 
tips like family recipes, prefers 
make-it-work accessories. The 
gregarious truck driver proudly shows 
off his homemade upgrades: a 
depthÔ¨Ånder mount that holds a 
transducer in the water; a retractable 
Ô¨Çashlight system he uses to raise a 
beam above the boat while paddling in 
the dark; and an anchor made from a 
Ô¨Çounder-gig lure that rides vertically 
inside a PVC tube. A tee Ô¨Åtting allows 
him to operate a release line from the 
paddling seat, driving the gig into the 
Louisiana muck to hold the boat in 
perfect casting position. ‚ÄúI could buy 
this stuff,‚Äù Barbier says, ‚Äúbut I got a 
liking for making things I can put on a 
kayak. Give me PVC, aluminum stock 
and pop rivets, and I can perform 
rigging miracles.‚Äù 
On my last day in the marsh, I try 
out the catamaran-like Native Ultimate 
hybrid, which seems as stable as a 
Ô¨Çoating dock. I alternate 
paddle strokes with casts, 
the kayak parting curtains of 
green and gold reeds, its 
passage silent save for the 
sibilant hiss of marsh grass 
on polyethylene.
Suddenly a 30-inch 
redÔ¨Åsh jets from an under-
hang of marsh muck, 
slashing at the lure not 5 feet 
from the boat. ‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù I hol-
ler, the strike so sudden and 
close that it‚Äôs almost entirely 
unexpected even though I 
am, in fact, Ô¨Åshing. I set the 
hook and hang on as the Ô¨Åsh tugs the 
kayak in a full 360. Three times I reel in 
the redÔ¨Åsh, and three times it screams 
away. When the Ô¨Åsh Ô¨Ånally succumbs, 
Ô¨Ånning gently beside the boat, sunlight 
Ô¨Çashes on its copper Ô¨Çanks.
It‚Äôs when I pull out the pliers to free 
the Ô¨Åsh that I realize there‚Äôs not 
another soul in sight, no one I can brag 
to about the catch. Thanks to the 
kayaks, each of us is off in our own 
world of water and grass. And I 
wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.  FC
designs. It‚Äôs outÔ¨Åtted with the Mirage-
Drive propulsion system, a pedal-
powered pair of Ô¨Çexible Ô¨Åns that 
function as oscillating foils‚Äîmuch like 
penguin and sea-turtle Ô¨Çippers. Not 
only does the kayak move more quickly 
than a paddled model, but I can 
two-hand a Ô¨Åshing rod while cruising 
across the water. And it‚Äôs equipped with 
a system that allows me to drop the 
anchor off the stern with just a tug on a 
cord. ‚ÄúThese things stretch the term 
kayak,‚Äù says Brendan Bayard, BCKFC‚Äôs 
nonÔ¨Åshing models except for rod 
holders. Some of the hybrid craft look 
like a cross between a canoe and a 
kayak, with built-in mounts for Ô¨Åshing 
electronics and pontoon-boat hulls 
that provide extra stability for 
standing anglers. Other outÔ¨Åts sell

WE PIT EIGHT MOWERS AGAINST REAL-WORLD LAWNS‚ÄîAND EACH OTHER. BY ROY BERENDSOHN
 Years of teÔ¨Üing have taught us 
that any lawn machine can cut grass 
under ideal conditions. e queÔ¨Üion is 
how well it does amid the vagaries of 
the real world‚Äîwhere the grass is 
oen dry and brittle or wet and tall, 
there are Ô¨Üeep hills to climb and you 
have to coax the mower over roots.
Those conditions are what we 
faced when we teÔ¨Üed the new crop  
of convertible mulching mowers‚Äî
machines that cut and broadcaÔ¨Ü clip-
pings, and bag them or mulch them 
back into the grass. We gathered 
eight mowers at a farm at the edge of 
the Catskills in lower New York Ô¨Üate. 
All but one had a 190-cc engine; we 
threw in a high-torque 160-cc model 
to keep things intereÔ¨Üing. en we 
put the mowers to work on and oÔ¨Ä 
over three weeks of sun, wind and 
rain. Here‚Äôs our report.

 ‚ÄúA sweet ride.‚Äù at‚Äôs how one of our teÔ¨Üers 
described the quick-clipping Crasman. One 
example of its smart design is the spring-loaded 
height adjuÔ¨Üment. Pull up on the large red grip at 
each wheel and pivot to the corre height setting. 
Let go of the handle, and the height-adjuÔ¨Üment pin 
snaps sharply into its hole. Other nice details 
include the well-shielded drive belt under the deck 
and a responsive squeeze-handle drive lever. 
q Louder than other mowers. Grass built 
up under the deck, at the rear mulch plug, though it 
didn‚Äôt interfere with mowing. (We also teÔ¨Üed the 
$500 Crasman 37103. We found it pleasant and 
clean-cutting, but too slow for our taÔ¨Ües.)

speed is quick to adjuÔ¨Ü using a pivoting top handle 
(Deere calls it the MowMentum syÔ¨Üem), and there‚Äôs 
so little rolling resiÔ¨Üance that with the engine oÔ¨Ä, 
the machine juÔ¨Ü skates down the driveway or 
around the garage. One pull Ô¨Üarts the mower, and 
one easy-pivoting lever raises and lowers the deck. 
q e pivoting top-handle drive control 
seems better suited for simple cut patterns, not the 
elaborate back-and-forth aion or pivoting moves 
that some yards require.

 e luxury car of walk-behind lawnmowers. 
e Honda leaves a velvet Ô¨Ånish, thanks to a unique 
dual blade and a domed plaÔ¨Üic deck that keeps the 
clippings suspended as they are cut and recut. e 
mower Ô¨Üays unusually clean as it cuts, both in wet 
and dry grass, or even as it plows through a pile of 
dry leaves. Niceties include a large fuel cap that‚Äôs 
easy to turn and tool-free air-Ô¨Ålter access.
 Someday, Honda will redesign the 
deck-li levers, which are small and uncomfortable 
to use. In the meantime, they mar an otherwise 
outÔ¨Üanding machine.

the laÔ¨Ü machines with a choke lever, handy for 
cold-climate users who prefer a slightly fuel-rich 
Ô¨Üart. Shi to choke and pull on the recoil Ô¨Üart

worked well, and the mower Ô¨Üarted almoÔ¨Ü

box. We welded it. We also found that the drive 
belt under the deck was poorly proteed‚Äîan

q is is a great idea. e Snapper is 
equipped with a device called a Fresh Start insert 
in its gas cap. is slowly releases a drip of 
concentrated fuel preservative into the gas tank. 
When the insert runs dry, the user snaps a new one 
into the cap. By preserving the gas in the mower 
inÔ¨Üead of your gas can, you‚Äôre always assured of 
Ô¨Üabilized fuel during the cutting season, 
regardless of how many cans of fuel you run 
through. Additionally, with a rated top speed of  
4 mph, the Snapper is a quick clipper. 
q Like the Deere, the Snapper‚Äôs top-
handle drive control is better for cutting open 
areas, not for intricate, back-and-forth mowing.

q Top-to-bottom attention to detail. Toro‚Äôs 
engineers designed a mower that suits a variety of 
users and mowing conditions. Leave the bag on 
the mower and switch between mulching and 
bagging with the Ô¨Çip of a lever near the rear wheel. 
Mow at your own pace by simply pushing more 
Ô¨Årmly againÔ¨Ü the handle, which slides forward and 
makes the mower go faÔ¨Üer. Back oÔ¨Ä the pressure 
to slow down. Other features combine to make 
this a value-packed produ: a Ô¨Åtting where you can 
attach a garden hose for washing the underside of 
the deck, and a three-year warranty that covers the 
mower‚Äôs drive syÔ¨Üem and ease-of-Ô¨Üart capability.

Q
I installed vinyl cove base molding in my kitchen and 
front foyer because we mop those Ô¨Çoors regularly, and all 
that cleaning ruined the wood baseboard trim that was in 
there. e problem is that I can‚Äôt make the outside corners of 
the cove base look nice. I tried folding the cove base around  
the corner, but it won‚Äôt stay put. e pieces that I put down are 
already pulling loose. I tried cutting an outside miter on it but 
found that I couldn‚Äôt cut it accurately. How do pros get those 
nice, crisp outside corners?
A
e secret to a good outside cor-
ner on cove base is on the inside, 
which is grooved with a utility knife. 
(You can also use a specialty flooring 
tool known as a top-set cove-base 
gouge, but unless you handle hundreds 
of yards of cove-base material, it proba-
bly doesn‚Äôt make sense to buy one.) 
e inÔ¨Üallation of an outside corner 
works like this: FirÔ¨Ü, hold the cove base 
againÔ¨Ü the corner, and mark the corner 
location on the molding with a sharp 
pencil or an indelible marker. Now fold 
the outside face of the cove base 
againÔ¨Ü itself so that the marked line is 
at the center of the fold. Use the utility 
knife and pare across the width of the 
vinyl along the folded edge. is leaves 
a groove on the molding‚Äôs back that 
matches the rounded edge of the dry-
wall corner. It also creates a thin area 
that allows the molding to Ô¨Üretch as 
it‚Äôs wrapped around the corner.
You‚Äôll produce a neater Ô¨Åt if you Ô¨Çare 
out the groove ever so slightly at the 
base of the molding (a tip we Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü ran in 
PM in the 1940s, by the way, in an arti-
cle that describes installing linoleum 
base molding). By widening the groove, 
you let the molding Ô¨Üretch more where 
its vertical face meets the rounded cove 
at the base. Finally, if the cove does not 
meet the Ô¨Çoor neatly, pare away the 
tiny ridge at the bottom of the molding. 
Spread vinyl-cove-base adhesive on the 
cove-base back and press the molding 
into place. Professional Ô¨Çooring inÔ¨Üall-
ers work over the molding with a rubber 
roller to ensure it‚Äôs bonded Ô¨Årmly.
e Leak Technique
When it rains all day, water leaks into 
our basement. We removed some 
drywall and found a crack in the 
foundation that looks like somebody 
had tried to repair it by smearing  
some concrete over it. How do we 
really Ô¨Åx the problem?
It seems logical to use concrete to seal 
a crack, but a better material is water-
Ô¨Üopping mortar. It expands as it cures.
FirÔ¨Ü, remove enough drywall to get 
at the full length of the crack, then 
remove as much of the patch as you 
can using a hammer and a masonry 
chisel. Next, push the water-Ô¨Üopping 
mortar into the crack using a trowel.
at takes care of the inside. I‚Äôd dig

down and do the same thing on the out-
side. It‚Äôs also likely that you‚Äôve got a 
plugged foundation drain or a down-
spout discharges right next to the 
house. Take care of these and let the 
repair go through at least one rainy 
Ô¨Üretch of weather before repairing dry-
wall damage on the inside. 
Du Seal,
the Real Deal?
I have a two-Ô¨Çoor raised ranch that‚Äôs 
25 years old, and from what I can see, 
the dus aren‚Äôt very well sealed. 
ere are companies such as Aeroseal 
that claim they can seal air leaks from 
inside the dus. Is this service 
legitimate, and is it worth the money? 
Can I seal the dus myself?
I haven‚Äôt used it at my house, but 
Aeroseal looks to be a legitimate pro-
cess that‚Äôs well-engineered. And it 
should be. The technology was first 
developed by Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory. The contractors

who license it are trained and speciÔ¨Åcally 
equipped. In other words, you can‚Äôt buy 
the components at a hardware Ô¨Üore 
and simply set up shop. Given that it‚Äôs 
not unusual for a house to lose 10 to 20 
percent of heated and cooled air 
through leaks, it‚Äôs likely the process can 
pay for itself. e more severe the leak-
age, and the greater the demand on the 
house‚Äôs heating and cooling syÔ¨Üem, the 
quicker the payback. 
Here‚Äôs how the process works. FirÔ¨Ü, 
the du outlets are sealed and the du 
is pressurized. A pressure reading is 
taken that measures the amount of air 
escaping. Next, a fog of dry adhesive 
particles is blown into the du. e par-
ticles stick in places where the air 
stream makes a sharp turn to exit 
through a leak. e adhesive builds up 
at this point, eventually bridges the gap, 
and seals the leak from the inside. 
e coÔ¨Ü for an Aeroseal application 
can range from $1500 to $3000. One 
of the beÔ¨Ü aspes of the technology is 

slowly than their petroleum-based coun-
terparts, but the fume reduion makes 
it worthwhile.
Bad Trip
I‚Äôve got a circuit breaker that‚Äôs 
permanently tripped. It‚Äôs in a part of 
the house where we don‚Äôt spend much 
time, but I noticed there was no power 
in the wall outlets. So I went to the 
service panel and found the tripped 
breaker. It tripped with a small pop 
when I reset it. What causes this?
Based on your description, it‚Äôs almoÔ¨Ü 
certainly a wiring problem that eleri-
cians describe as a ‚Äúdead short.‚Äù Some-
where in the wiring the so-called hot 
wire (more officially known as the 
ungrounded conduor) and the neutral 
wire (known as the grounded conduor) 
are making conta. Usually, these two 
conduors are only conneed via an 
elerical load such as a light or an appli-
ance. When there‚Äôs no load between 
them, you get a massive inrush of cur-
rent that trips the breaker.  A similar 
thing happens if the hot wire makes con-
ta with the grounding wire (known as 
the documentation that shows the 
reduction in the duct‚Äôs leakage. Not 
only does this provide some peace of 
mind to the homeowner, it‚Äôs also proof 
for potential buyers.
Can a homeowner seal the home‚Äôs 
dus? Yes. (For a handy tutorial, visit 
rcdmastics.com.) It‚Äôs hard and dirty 
work, and there‚Äôs more to it than mak-
ing a wrap around a leaky joint using 
du tape that will later fall oÔ¨Ä.
FirÔ¨Ü, you have to make a thorough 
inspeion of air-conditioning and heat-
ing vents and the places where the du 
passes through. That usually means 
crawling around in an attic or crawl-
space, and it can mean standing in 
weird positions on a Ô¨Üepladder while 
using a telescoping inspeion mirror 
to look at joints and seams that are not 
easily visible. en you have to seal with 
maÔ¨Üic and perhaps Ô¨Åberglass mesh, if 
the gaps are quite large. 
It can take a fair amount of grit and 
determination to get at these spots, 
and unless you hire a heating‚Äìcooling 
contraor to teÔ¨Ü-pressurize the sys-
tem, you have no proof of how eÔ¨Äec-
tive your eÔ¨Äorts have been. Still, the 
more thorough you are, the greater 
your likelihood of success.
We Have LioÔ¨Ä 
When removing old wall-to-wall 
carpet in a bedroom, I discovered and 
removed the 9 x 9 resilient Ô¨Çoor tiles 
below. Although the tiles came up 
easily, there is a layer of black maÔ¨Üic 
le on the subÔ¨Çoor. It‚Äôs not Ô¨Üicky. 
Should I scrape this Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä up before 
putting down new carpet?
I wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs possible that the old 
adhesive has asbeÔ¨Üos Ô¨Åbers in it. It‚Äôs 
beÔ¨Ü le undiÔ¨Üurbed. Rather, I‚Äôd Ô¨Çoor 
over the material with 3‚ÅÑ16-inch lauan 
plywood. at will give you a nice clean 
surface to inÔ¨Üall new carpet on.
If for some reason that won‚Äôt work 
(for inÔ¨Üance, the increased Ô¨Çoor height 
caused by the plywood makes for diÔ¨É-
cult Ô¨Çoor transitions), you could scrape 
oÔ¨Ä the maÔ¨Üic aer soening it with 
maÔ¨Üic remover. (FirÔ¨Ü send a teÔ¨Ü sam-
ple of the maÔ¨Üic to a lab to determine 
if it contains asbeÔ¨Üos.) Do not use a 
petroleum-solvent maÔ¨Üic remover for 
this work. InÔ¨Üead, try a soy-based or 
similar product. These work more 


the equipment-grounding conductor). 
Fortunately, the breaker is doing its job 
and is opening the circuit.
Is it possible that it‚Äôs just an old 
 circuit breaker with a worn-out spring? 
Usually a breaker like that trips without 
the popping noise. Also, it‚Äôs not usually 
inÔ¨Üantaneous. at is, you can reset 
the breaker and it will hold for a little 
while, but eventually it will trip on its 
own. I wouldn‚Äôt simply replace the 
breaker, though. at‚Äôs gambling, not 
diagnosis. Determining whether the 
breaker is bad requires knowing how to 
work safely inside the service panel and 
how to use a voltage-ohm multimeter.
I‚Äôd recommend you call an eleri-
cian. e problem can be simple, such 
as two old wires with frayed insulation 
that have come into conta in a recep-
tacle box, or it can be complex, such as 
water leakage in the service panel that 
has resulted in some rotted wiring.
Worth the Weight?
A vinyl-fence website says its Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä is 
better than the vinyl fence you can buy 
at a home center.  Is this true?
Sometimes the only vinyl fence avail-
able at a home center is lightweight  
and pretty thin. e poÔ¨Üs, for example, 
are really a sleeve. You put a pressure- 
treated poÔ¨Ü in the ground and slip the 
vinyl sleeve over it.
e heavier vinyl fence that contrac-
tors use is available through websites, 
some lumberyards, vinyl supply houses 
and landscape supply centers. With 
these syÔ¨Üems, the poÔ¨Üs generally don‚Äôt 
need reinforcement, except at gates. In 
that case, the supplier usually makes an 
aluminum insert speciÔ¨Åcally designed 
for gatepoÔ¨Üs. With some of these fence 
syÔ¨Üems, other parts such as the lower 
support rail are also reinforced with 
heavy-gauge aluminum.
Does this mean that these syÔ¨Üems 
are better? at‚Äôs a tough call. Although 
they‚Äôre not diÔ¨Écult to inÔ¨Üall, they are 
not as easily inÔ¨Üalled as the syÔ¨Üems 
you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd in home centers, which are 
designed with homeowners in mind. To 
my casual observation, these fences are 
less likely to sag over time, and they 
seem more wind-resistant. Given 
enough abuse (such as a Ô¨Çying golf ball 
or ice chunks hurled by a passing snow 
plow), any vinyl fence can be damaged.
Finally, regardless of the syÔ¨Üem you 
use, conta your Ô¨Üate‚Äôs One Call sys-
tem to locate underground utilities 
before beginning fencework.
Feeling Flushed
We have toilets in back-to-back 
bathrooms that are showing poor 
Ô¨Çush performance. We had the drain 
cleaned, and both Ô¨Çush valves are only 
a couple of years old. e toilets are 
about 10 years old, and they juÔ¨Ü 
seem to be performing more poorly. 
e house is about 50 years old, if 
that makes a diÔ¨Äerence.
It‚Äôs a classic problem. Here‚Äôs an easy 
check. Stand in one bathroom and sim-
ply observe the water in one toilet (with-
out Ô¨Çushing) while someone in the other 
bathroom Ô¨Çushes that toilet. 
It‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll see the water in 
the unÔ¨Çushed bowl bob up and down. 
That indicates a lack of air available 
through the roof vent. A similar thing 
happens in properly funioning plumb-
ing when a Ô¨Ürong wind blows over a 
roof vent, pulling a vacuum on the water 
in the toilet‚Äôs trap. Okay, I admit that it 
seems weird to Ô¨Üand there and watch 
for this on a windy day. If your wife gives 
you a hard time, you can blame it on us.
Plumbing-vent problems are not 
unusual in older homes. As the home 
ages, branches grow out and overhang 
the roof. All it takes are a couple of 
leaves or seedpods a year to fall into the 
roof vent opening. Eventually, this spells 
trouble for the vent syÔ¨Üem. Clean out 
the roof vent with a long piece of hooked 
wire. e problem should go away.

Cold Storage
JUST BECAUSE YOUR CLASSIC MAY BE OFF THE ROAD DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN YOU CAN SKIMP 
ON SERVICE. HERE‚ÄôS HOW TO GET YOUR CAR READY FOR STORAGE. BY MIKE ALLEN
 ‚ÄúGreetings from the President of 
the United States.‚Äù at‚Äôs what it said 
when my draft notice came in the 
mail, a couple of wars ago. But inÔ¨Üead 
of thinking about how hard it would be 
to leave my family and friends for 
months, or years, I had another 
thought that ping-ponged around 
inside my head. What to do with my 
beloved and pampered 1965 Mus-
tang? It was juÔ¨Ü too dear to my heart 
to part with, and I didn‚Äôt dare leave it 
for my parents to drive‚Äîor worse yet, 
my little brother. It would juÔ¨Ü have to 
be pickled, and put up on blocks for 
the duration. That was a long time 
ago, and I wish I had done a better job 
of preserving that car, so I could drive 
it today. Yes, I miss that MuÔ¨Üang.
ere are lots of men and women 
serving in our armed forces around 
is Porsche is getting the royal treatment for its wintertime nap: a cool, dry indoor Ô¨Üor-
age facility, a Ô¨Åtted cloth car cover and freedom from vermin. It‚Äôll be like new in the spring.

Where to Park It
 If you muÔ¨Ü tuck your car away for 
an extended period of time, the beÔ¨Ü 
thing you can do is Ô¨Ånd an appropriate 
place. Obviously, Ô¨Üoring the car indoors 
is beÔ¨Ü. But if outside is the only choice, 
Ô¨Ånd a spot that‚Äôs dry, away from the 
sun‚Äôs rays and far from trees. Trees have 
leaves or needles, which will land on 
your car and can trap moiÔ¨Üure. Trees 
also have birds with poor toilet habits. If 
possible, pick a spot that isn‚Äôt infeÔ¨Üed 
with vermin, so avoid leaving the car 
near a woodpile or a row of  garbage 
cans. Some car manufaurers use wir-
ing insulated with plaÔ¨Üic derived from 
soybeans, and rodents will eat it clean 
oÔ¨Ä the wires. ey‚Äôll chomp on rubber 
hoses and belts. I once had a mouse 
neÔ¨Ü that blew out of my exhauÔ¨Ü sys-
tem when I fired the car up‚Äîand it 
nearly set my garage on Ô¨Åre. 
At any rate, there is  plenty you 
should do. Start with a thorough clean-
ing, inside and out. If you live where they 
dump salt on the road in winter, break 
out the pressure washer and get all that 
the globe. And I receive plenty of mail 
from them asking me how they should 
Ô¨Üore their cars while they are overseas. 
e rules of vehicular cold Ô¨Üorage are 
the same no matter why the car is le 
behind. But Ô¨Üorage isn‚Äôt always kind to 
vehicles. Corrosion and decay take their 
toll on engines, bodies and interiors. 
Time itself can ruin tires, and even a car 
Ô¨Üored inside a garage can attra some 
unwanted furry house guests. Here‚Äôs 
how to prote and Ô¨Üore your car, truck 
or motorcycle‚Äîthe right way.
Store or Sell?
 Unless there‚Äôs something very 
special about a particular car, I don‚Äôt 
suggest placing a car in storage for 
more than a year. Special-intereÔ¨Ü and 
colleor cars, like that 1966 Vette or 
antique Hispano-Suiza, might tug on 
your heartstrings (and purse strings) 
enough to keep them in the family, but 
anything that qualiÔ¨Åes as praical daily 
transportation, no matter how nice it is, 
should be sold. You can replace it with 
another car when you‚Äôre in need of a 
vehicle again. e loss in value of a car 
that accrues in another year from its 
manufacture, even if the odometer 
doesn‚Äôt see any more miles, is too high.
One option for shorter-term situa-
tions is to simply keep the car on the 
road. Find some responsible adult who 
will drive the car every two or three 
weeks for an hour or more. This will 
keep the drivetrain lubricated and the 
battery charged. An engine that doesn‚Äôt 
I L L U S T R A T I O N S B Y  G A B R I E L  S I L V E I R A
run regularly collects moisture and 
internal ruÔ¨Ü, especially on the portions 
of the cylinder walls not covered by the 
pistons, valves, camshafts and valve 
springs. Ditto for the brake discs, which 
are made from easy-to-ruÔ¨Ü caÔ¨Ü iron. A 
car that‚Äôs driven far enough to get com-
pletely warm and remain that way for 
an hour or more will drive oÔ¨Ä the mois-
ture, coat any lubricated surfaces with 
oil again, and sweep the rust off the 
discs before they Ô¨Üart to pit. 
And keep your insurance aive: In 
some Ô¨Üates, dropping your car insur-
ance, even if you‚Äôre not going to be driv-
ing, will make it nearly impossible or 
very expensive to get insurance again 
when you‚Äôre ready. Check with your 
insurance agent; he may be able to 
reduce your coverage or transfer it to 
some less expensive option. At the very 
leaÔ¨Ü, you‚Äôll want the and vandalism 
coverage‚ÄîjuÔ¨Ü in case. 
1. Moth Crystals
Keep furry vermin 
from eating your 
soy-based wiring 
insulation or using 
your seat foam for 
neÔ¨Üing material.  
I won‚Äôt even 
mention the urine. 
Put a dish of moth 
cryÔ¨Üals covered  
in aluminum foil 
inside. Renew 
several times  
a year. 
2. Fogging Oil
We bought this at 
a marina, but you 
could order it from 
the auto parts 
Ô¨Üore. is 
preservative oil 
creeps into the 
internal parts of 
the engine and 
prevents ruÔ¨Üing on 
machined surfaces. 
Spray liberally into 
all the spark plug 
holes.
3. Battery 
Removal
Remove the 
battery from the 
car. For short-term 
Ô¨Üorage, you can 
leave it in place 
disconneed, but 
it‚Äôs better to 
remove the battery 
and Ô¨Üore it 
someplace where 
it‚Äôs above freezing 
and dry. Clean the 
surface of 
conduive oil, dirt 
and corrosion, and 
keep it charged 
with a proper 
battery maintainer, 
not juÔ¨Ü a trickle 
charger. For 
long-term Ô¨Üorage, 
give this one to 
someone who 
needs a battery 
and buy a new one 
when it‚Äôs time.

and conne a battery maintainer. For 
longer-term Ô¨Üorage, remove the bat-
tery and Ô¨Üore it indoors in a dry place 
above freezing, again, with a battery 
maintainer.
If you‚Äôre Ô¨Üoring inside, under a cover, 
leave the windows cracked open an 
inch to prevent moisture and funky 
smells from collecting. If the storage 
area is genuinely secure, prop the doors 
and trunk open a few inches to keep 
from compressing the gaskets. Worried 
about spiders? ey‚Äôll get in even if the 
doors are closed and the windows are 
up, so relax. Speaking of the gaskets, 
give all the rubber door, window and 
trunk gaskets a generous coating of sili-
cone spray or, better yet, silicone grease 
to keep the rubber from getting hard.
Once you have the vehicle prepped 
inside and out, jack the car up and sup-
port it on four proper jackÔ¨Üands‚Äîbut 
only if the Ô¨Çoor is concrete. Soil, gravel 
and even asphalt are too unÔ¨Üable for  
the long haul. Now you can remove the 
wheels for Ô¨Üorage, which will keep the 
tires from Ô¨Çat-spotting and the wheels 
from corroding. It‚Äôll also give you access 
to the brakes. You did remember to 
loosen the lug nuts before you jacked it 
up, right? Keep the wheels and tires 
somewhere dry and cool, and nowhere 
near ozone-generating electrical 
motors. Let the air out of the tires. If you 
must store them outdoors, at least 
 cover them to keep the UV in sunlight 
from degrading the rubber. If you are 
Ô¨Üoring a car for Ô¨Åve years or longer, you 
should probably sell those tires now and 
purchase new ones when you are ready 
to get back on the road.
Take the laÔ¨Ü of the fogging oil that 
you used inside the engine and spray the 
brake discs with a thin coat to keep 
them from ruÔ¨Üing. Avoid getting oil on 
the calipers, because the rubber caliper 
boots and seals won‚Äôt like the hydro-
carbons in the oil.
Starting Over
 You‚Äôre back in town, ready to Ô¨Üart 
driving, so it‚Äôs time to unpickle your ride. 
Start by reinÔ¨Çating your tires with some 
nice, dry air. How do you know if the air is 
dry? Depress the inÔ¨Çator-nozzle pin with 
your Ô¨Ånger. If your Ô¨Ånger gets wet, you‚Äôve 
got water in the hose, caused by atmo-
spheric humidity colleing in the com-
pressor tank. MoiÔ¨Üure inside the tires 
will corrode the rims and degrade the 
rubber. Fill with either dry air or nitrogen. 
Clean the brake discs by showering 
them with aerosol brake cleaner, and 
reinÔ¨Üall the wheels. Use the Ô¨Çoor jack to 
li the vehicle oÔ¨Ä the Ô¨Üands and remove 
the car cover. If you‚Äôve le wax on the 
surface, polish it oÔ¨Ä. Change any Ô¨Çuids 
that weren‚Äôt changed immediately prior 
to Ô¨Üorage, especially the brake Ô¨Çuid. 
InÔ¨Üall the battery, which should have 
plenty of charge if you‚Äôve kept it on a 
maintainer. If you‚Äôve fogged the inside of 
the engine, it‚Äôll probably be a little hard to 
Ô¨Üart, so be prepared to 
swap out for new spark 
plugs if a minute or two 
of cranking won‚Äôt light 
the fires. Avoid using 
ether-based starting 
Ô¨Çuid. I saw a guy punch 
a conneing rod right through the side 
of the engine block on his S-10 by using 
ether. A little judicious priming with aero-
sol carb cleaner might help, but don‚Äôt 
lose your eyebrows.  
FC
salt oÔ¨Ä the undercarriage. 
If your coolant is more than halfway 
to its expiration (either two years for con-
ventional coolant or Ô¨Åve years for long-
life coolant), Ô¨Çush and reÔ¨Åll with fresh, 
which will have more anticorrosive addi-
tives available for the long haul. If there 
are any leaks in the cooling system, 
engine transmission or axle, better to Ô¨Åx 
them now rather than aer they‚Äôve bled 
Ô¨Çuids all over your Ô¨Çoor‚Äîand before they 
leak dry and leave your gears or other 
metal parts exposed to corrosion. 
Use a marine-Ô¨Üyle fogging oil to pro-
te internal engine parts. On carburet-
ed cars, spray direly into the carbu-
retor while the engine is at idle, until the 
engine dies as the plugs are oiled down, 
then pull the plugs and spray a 
10-second blast into each plug hole. 
Replace the plugs. If you have fuel injec-
tion, especially if your injeion syÔ¨Üem 
uses an MAF sensor, skip spraying into 
the intake lest you damage the sen-
sors‚ÄîjuÔ¨Ü do the plug holes. 
For short-term Ô¨Üorage, you can sim-
ply remove the battery‚Äôs negative cable, 
4. Fuel  
Stabilizer
Add the corre 
amount of fuel 
Ô¨Üabilizer to the 
tank to keep the 
fuel from oxidizing 
and turning into 
varnish. Fill the 
tank to the brim to 
prevent condensa-
tion in the space 
above the gas, 
then run the 
engine long 
enough to circulate 
the Ô¨Üabilizer.
5. Cleaning 
Clean the interior 
and shampoo the 
upholÔ¨Üery and 
carpets so Ô¨Üains 
don‚Äôt get a chance 
to set. And remove 
all those French 
fries and Jujubes 
that attra inses 
and rodents. Send 
me all the loose 
change you Ô¨Ånd. 
en wax the 
outside, but don‚Äôt 
polish all the wax 
oÔ¨Ä, so the surface 
has an extra layer 
of proteion. 
What kind of wax? 
It doesn‚Äôt really 
matter, as long as 
it‚Äôs car wax. en 
use a cloth car 
cover, not a plaÔ¨Üic 
tarp, which will 
trap moiÔ¨Üure and 
scratch the paint. If 
you‚Äôre Ô¨Üoring 
indoors, you might 
get away with 
using a clean 
bedsheet or new 
fabric dropcloth.
6. Oil Change
Change the oil and 
Ô¨Ålter, although I‚Äôd 
recommend 
changing them 
again within a few 
miles aer coming 
out of Ô¨Üorage.

Bad News Bearer
A 
Ah, the epic, classic fail. e good 
news is that now you probably 
have your timing belt timed correctly. 
The bad news is that you‚Äôve severely 
damaged your engine. Who would think 
something as simple and low-tech as 
replacing a water pump could totally 
trash an engine? From the top: You 
removed the timing belt to get to the 
water pump, which happens to be 
mounted behind the timing belt. It‚Äôs 
very clear to me, ex post facto, that you 
reinstalled the belt out of time, which is 
easy to do. at‚Äôs especially true if you 
didn‚Äôt realize that it needed to be 
installed with the pulleys aligned prop-
Q 
I replaced the water pump in my 2003 Mitsubishi 
Outlander. When I tried to start it, the cam timing was 
oÔ¨Ä. So I adjusted that, and now it will crank but won‚Äôt start. 
At one point I had white smoke and the smell of fuel in my 
air-Ô¨Ålter box, but no actual fuel there. Please help.
I L L U S T R A T I O N B Y  G A B R I E L  S I L V E I R A
erly. (It‚Äôs too late now, but I also hope 
you used a new belt.) Specifically, the 
cranksha and the camsha had to be 
properly indexed before you slipped the 
belt into place, preserving the phase 
relationship between the crank and the 
cam. The crankshaft rotates twice for 
every turn of the camsha‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not 
going to take up half the column to 
explain basic four-stroke engine theory, 
at least not this month. When you tried 
to start the engine with the cam 
improperly timed, some of the valves 
were still at least partly open when 
their respective pistons came to top 
dead center. Two physical objects can‚Äôt 
occupy the same place at 
the same time (see Ein-
stein‚Äôs theory of relativity), 
and the aforementioned 
valves bent.
is was bad. Bent valves 
don‚Äôt seal againÔ¨Ü the valve 
seat very well. But once you 
realized your mistake, you 
did fix the incorrect cam-
sha timing. e bad news: 
Now your engine has no 
compression, because the 
valves aren‚Äôt closing, allow-
ing the air/fuel mixture to be 
pumped back upÔ¨Üream into 
the air cleaner. Unfortu-
nately, you muÔ¨Ü now remove the cylin-
der head to replace the bent valves, and 
maybe the piÔ¨Üons, conneing rods and 
cranksha as well. Next time, read the 
manual Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü.
Not all engines will be damaged by 
an out-of-time or even a failed timing 
belt. If the valve doesn‚Äôt open far enough 
to hit the piÔ¨Üon, it won‚Äôt bend. Why 
don‚Äôt they juÔ¨Ü make these engines so 
the valves won‚Äôt ever hit the piÔ¨Üons, 
even if the belt snaps or goes out of 
time? Some engines, referred to in the 
industry as noninterference engines, 
will indeed suÔ¨Äer no damage when the 
belt goes south. Yours, however, is not 
Improper camsha 
timing can deÔ¨Üroy 
an engine inÔ¨Üantly, 
as the piÔ¨Üon 
smashes into the 
valve head, bending 
the Ô¨Üem. Not all 
engines will suÔ¨Äer 
this fate, however.

one of these. Noninterference 
engines tend to be low-performance 
dogs because the valves have to 
open far enough to gulp air/fuel mix-
ture to make power. Shallow valve 
li equals less power.
Civic Longevity
I own a 2007 Honda Civic EX sedan 
with an automatic transmission. I 
want to get the moÔ¨Ü from this 
Civic, so I take care of it, drive it 
gently and plan to use it until it juÔ¨Ü 
won‚Äôt run anymore. When I 
commute to work, I have a choice 
of driving about 30 miles one way 
over a Ô¨Üeep and twiÔ¨Üy mountain 
road, or driving 40 miles on a more 
level surface and at a Ô¨Üeady 
highway speed. Which route would 
you recommend for the longevity 
of my car?
is one is a tough call. Exaly how 
twiÔ¨Üy is the mountain road? FaÔ¨Üer 
Ô¨Üeady-Ô¨Üate driving is better than  
canyon carving. But in your case 
you‚Äôre driving 33 percent farther to 
achieve this wear-and-tear savings. 
If you can drive sensibly, without 
using a lot of throttle, downshiing 
and heavy braking, the mountain 
route might aually be no harder on 
your car. Spirited driving will con-
sume more tires and brakes‚Äîbut I 
can outdrive most people on a 
mountain road I know well without 
using much of either. As they say, 
your mileage may vary.
Without knowing anything about 
the road, I‚Äôll suggest you take the 
route that consumes the least 
amount of fuel, in total‚Äînot per mile. 
at‚Äôs probably the beÔ¨Ü indication of 
how hard you‚Äôre using your car.
MyÔ¨Üerious Drier 
I have a 2008 Mercury Mariner 
Hybrid with 8000 miles on it. I 
have noticed that the Mercury 
wants to veer le, ever so slightly. I 
have visited two dealers, and both 
have said there is nothing wrong, 
but I know diÔ¨Äerently. I Ô¨Ånd that it 
requires slightly less eÔ¨Äort to turn 
le than it does to turn right. On 
older cars with power Ô¨Üeering, 
you had a way of adjuÔ¨Üing the 
power unit. But they tell me these 

newer ones do not and that there is 
no adjuÔ¨Üment. What‚Äôs the truth?
There is no left‚Äìright adjustment on 
your Ô¨Üeering rack. Some old-fashioned 
recirculating-ball Ô¨Üeering boxes had an 
adjuÔ¨Üment, but that was used only for 
taking up slack as they wore, not to 
corre a tendency to veer le or right. 
However, there are plenty of adjuÔ¨Ü-
ments in the Mariner‚Äôs suspension for 
camber, caÔ¨Üer and toe-in‚Äîat both the 
front and rear. I don‚Äôt suppose anyone 
has actually checked the alignment 
beyond juÔ¨Ü taking a teÔ¨Ü drive around 
the lot? Another cause might be a bad 
tire or one that‚Äôs worn in an odd way. If 
the alignment is okay, try a tire rotation 
to see if the problem changes sides (but 
it probably won‚Äôt go away). You may 
need to replace one or more tires.
More data: Because road surfaces 
are crowned oÔ¨Ä to the curbside, many 
manufaurers bias a vehicle‚Äôs suspen-
sion settings to compensate. SpeciÔ¨Å-
cally, they call for diÔ¨Äerent camber set-
tings between the le and right front 
wheels, which can make the vehicle 
tend to veer le on absolutely Ô¨Çat roads. 
e faory alignment speciÔ¨Åcations for 
your Mariner are symmetrical, however.
Synthetic Recycling
I have a queÔ¨Üion about recycling 
synthetic motor oils. Can it be done? I 
have never heard anything about the 
proper disposal of used synthetic oil.
Synthetic or synthetic-blend motor oils 
should be disposed of juÔ¨Ü like conven-
tional mineral oils. In moÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üates, any 
place that changes oil commercially is 
required to accept small quantities of 
used motor oil from consumers for free. 
ese eÔ¨Üablishments send this oil to 
recyclers, where it‚Äôs used as the base 
stock for other petroleum products, 
including motor oil. ere are also some 
places that burn it in special furnaces 
for space heat in their shop.
I L L U S T R AT I O N  B Y  G A B R I E L  S I LV E I R A
Wintertime is generally 
no fun, at leaÔ¨Ü in my 
opinion. One cold day, a 
neighbor brought me his 
car, diÔ¨Üraught. His 
mechanic had told him he 
had a head or manifold 
gasket leak, and that his 
oil was heavily contami-
nated with coolant. 
Uh-oh. A manifold gasket 
leak could coÔ¨Ü several 
hundred bucks to remedy. 
A head gasket leak 
requires maybe a cool 
grand to Ô¨Åx.  Bad:    
I pulled the dipÔ¨Üick, and it 
was covered with dark  
brown glop that had the 
exa consiÔ¨Üency of 
mayonnaise.  Ditto for the 
underside of the 
oil-Ô¨Åller cap. 
Good: ere was 
no evidence of 
any oil in the 
coolant. So I 
Ô¨Üarted asking 
queÔ¨Üions. What 
is this vehicle‚Äôs 
usual drive cycle? He 
mentioned the car was 
used only for short 
errands around town. 
But the real clue was the 
weather. We had 
experienced weeks of 
snow and temps in the 
teens. Diagnosis? Not a 
bad gasket, but an engine 
that had a lot of moiÔ¨Üure 
built up in the crankcase. 
On those quick trips, the 
oil temperature never got 
high enough to drive the 
water out of the oil and 
into the PCV syÔ¨Üem. 
JuÔ¨Ü to be sure, we 
changed the oil and Ô¨Ålter, 
which appeared normal. 
e dipÔ¨Üick tube and oil 
cap were simply in an 
area of the engine 
compartment that never 
got warm, and the 
moiÔ¨Üure emulsiÔ¨Åed with 
the water, making glop 
remarkably like mayon-
naise. Cure? An occa-
sional trip of an hour or 
so on a warmer day to 
allow the water to be 
driven oÔ¨Ä.

Proper Diagnosis Pays OÔ¨Ä

If neither scenario is an option, con-
ta your local Department of Public 
Works, or even the local Ô¨Åre depart-
ment, to see what the proper disposal 
methods are.
Charged Up
I made a human-powered battery 
charger consiÔ¨Üing of a bicycle and a 
Bosch 65-amp alternator (salvaged 
from an old BMW) for my emergency 
power syÔ¨Üem, which consiÔ¨Üs of a 
bank of RV batteries maintained by a 
20-watt solar panel. I can produce 
about 15 amps comfortably with the 
bicycle when I use light bulbs as the 
load. But when I try charging the 
batteries, they only accept around  
3 amps unless they are deeply 
discharged. So I spend a lot of time 
pedaling to keep the batteries 
charged when I need backup power. 
Am I corre that raising the output 
voltage of the alternator will increase 
the rate the batteries charge? How 
do I accomplish this? All Bosch 
regulators that I have seen appear to 
have the same (or very similar) 
voltage output.
First of all, a lead-acid battery‚Äôs 
charging- current proÔ¨Åle tapers oÔ¨Ä sub-
Ô¨Üantially as it reaches about 50 per-
cent of its capacity, even if the charging 
voltage is corre. Raising it above 14.5 
to 14.7 volts won‚Äôt make it charge any 
faÔ¨Üer and will damage the battery. An 
automotive alternator is a constant-
voltage device, and it‚Äôs not optimized 
for rapidly charging a battery. The 
charge time of a sealed lead-acid bat-
tery is 12 to 16 hours (up to 36 hours 
for larger capacity batteries). With 
higher charge currents and multiÔ¨Üage 
charge methods, the charge time can 
be reduced to 10 hours or less. Lead-
acid cannot be fully charged as quickly 
as nickel or lithium-based systems. 
After approximately half of the bat-
tery‚Äôs capacity is reached during the 
bulk phase of charging, the current will 
taper oÔ¨Ä while voltage rises slightly. 
   What‚Äôs the battery voltage when the 
current starts to taper off? I‚Äôd say, 
charge for a while, then let the pack 
reÔ¨Ü for an hour with no charge or dis-
charge and measure the voltage at the 
battery poÔ¨Üs. Here‚Äôs a chart to corre-
late resting open-circuit voltage to 
charge Ô¨Üate at 68 F :
12.65 v = 100 percent
12.45 v = 75 percent
12.24 v = 50 percent
12.06 v = 25 percent
11.89 v or less = discharged
These specific gravities are highly 
dependent on the temperature of the 
elerolyte. I‚Äôll leave it to you as an exer-
cise to Ô¨Ånd the corre voltage at other 
temperatures. at laÔ¨Ü 25 percent of 
charge can‚Äôt be hurried much by upping 
the voltage. In fa, the Ô¨Ånish top-oÔ¨Ä 
charge should be at a leisurely 13.5 to 
13.7 volts to keep from damaging the 
battery and boiling water out of the 
elerolyte. 
But let‚Äôs give this a Ô¨Åghting chance: 
What is the voltage at the battery pack 
when the pedals are being cranked? 
Some of those old alternators had a set 
point of only 13.5 to 13.8 volts. A fresh 
voltage regulator should output around 
14.2 volts, measured at the alternator‚Äôs 
B+ terminal. Measure again at the bat-
tery poÔ¨Üs to check for voltage drop in 
the wiring. Anything more than a half-
volt or so diÔ¨Äerence (while you‚Äôre pedal-
ing away, of course) should precipitate 
an upgrade in your wiring. I‚Äôd use 10- or 
even 8-gauge wire, kept as short as 
possible, and with no intermediate con-
neors between B+ and the battery 
positive poÔ¨Ü. Ditto for the ground: Use 
a short piece of fat wire and run it 
direly from the alternator‚Äôs case caÔ¨Ü-
ing to the negative battery poÔ¨Ü. You 
might pick up another half-volt or so at 
the battery terminals by carefully reduc-
ing the resiÔ¨Üance in the wiring harness 
as much as possible.
Your last resort is an adjustable volt-
age regulator, which I found easily from 
several places on the Web, including 
eBay, for less than 20 bucks. DO NOT 
adjust it such that it ever delivers more 
than 14.5 volts at the battery posts. If 
your battery pack won‚Äôt deliver enough 
power to do what you need when it‚Äôs 
charged to 75 percent of its capacity, 
consider adding more batteries. The 
danger of that is that the electrolyte in a  
chronically undercharged battery will 
stratify, with much of the acid collecting 
near the bottom, leaving a more dilute 
solution at the top of the plates, reduc-
ing the battery‚Äôs capacity. 
You might consider upping the rating 

of your solar panel subÔ¨Üantially to pro-
vide the proper top-oÔ¨Ä charge.
Steal is!
Someone was Ô¨Üealing gas from my 
‚Äò07 Lincoln Town Car, so I put a 
locking gas cap on it. Now the fuel 
Ô¨Åller and Check Engine lights Ô¨Üay on. 
Is there a remedy? Will the engine 
get damaged?
It won‚Äôt damage the engine. But 
there is a trouble code being set, speciÔ¨Å-
cally one relating to the integrity of the 
evaporative emissions syÔ¨Üem, and your 
car can‚Äôt pass inspeion with it lit. at 
code is set because your locking gas cap 
isn‚Äôt sealing properly. It‚Äôs supposed to 
hold a small amount of pressure to keep 
gasoline vapors inside inÔ¨Üead of venting 
them to the atmosphere. The excess 
vapors are colleed in a caniÔ¨Üer full of 
aivated charcoal, and returned to the 
engine to be burned the next time the 
car is operated.
e remedy is to replace your cap 
with one that seals properly. Unfortu-
nately, not all locking gas caps are 
equal. If you bought one hanging on a 
peg from the auto parts aisle at some 
mass merchandiser, odds are it isn‚Äôt the 
corre one for your car, even if it seems 
to Ô¨Åt properly. Ford (or in your case, Lin-
coln) should have one available at the 
dealership‚Äôs parts counter. Or try asking 
at a real auto parts Ô¨Üore for a Stant 
10510, which should be the correct 
part for your car. Needless to say, other 
vehicles will require a diÔ¨Äerent cap to 
operate properly.
Pinch Proteion
My driver‚Äôs-side window goes up 
halfway automatically, then goes 
down all by itself. en, when I try to 
close it again, it won‚Äôt go at all unless I 
wait an hour.
Those automatic windows have a 
fail-safe to make them go back down if 
P M  D I Y  A U T O  /// C A R  C L I N I C  Q + A
they encounter some resistance (like 
your Ô¨Ångers or, say, the baby‚Äôs neck) to 
keep from hurting people. I‚Äôll guess the 
window is encountering some unusual 
resiÔ¨Üance, and is opening back up the 
way it‚Äôs programmed to do for safety. 
Check the window track for torn guides, 
gaskets, or foreign objes.  Spilled your 
Ô¨Üicky Big Gulp on the window lately?  A 
generous shot of silicone spray on the 
rubber guides oen will clear this up. 
What‚Äôs the wait about? For unre-
lated reasons, the eleric motor has an 
internal thermal protection circuit so 
you can‚Äôt burn out the motor windings 
by Ô¨Üalling it. is proteion automati-
cally resets when the motor cools oÔ¨Ä 
aer a few minutes.

 Anything that moves makes 
noise. And like many household 
machines, the personal computer is 
an assemblage of whirring, spinning, 
vibrating parts‚Äîhard drives, optical 
drives, heat-sink and exhauÔ¨Ü fans‚Äî
and each of these components con-
tributes to the overall noise of the 
computer. Depending on your particu-
lar machine and your sensitivity to 
such things, this can amount to a 
comforting white noise, or an irritat-
ing background drone that makes you 
want to kick a hole in the side of your 
computer to let the demons out.

For nearly every noisy component in your computer, there is 
a replacement that can accomplish the same thing more quietly.

the fans that came with our computer 
for a few 120-mm S-Flex fans from 
Scythe ($15 each). Not only were these 
fans larger and slower, but they are built 
with fluid-dynamic bearings for a 
smoother spin, which brings the decibel 
rating of each down to only 8.7. If your 
fans don‚Äôt natively run slow, you can dial 
them down manually by inÔ¨Üalling a con-
troller module (available from manufac-
turers such as ermaltake for around 
$25). ese typically mount in a 5.25-
inch drive bay‚Äîsuch as the one that 
houses your optical drive‚Äîand allow 
you to turn down the fan speed with the 
twiÔ¨Ü of a dial. JuÔ¨Ü remember to watch 
your computer‚Äôs temperature, which 
you can do with monitoring soware 
such as SpeedFan. 
One more note about fans. If possi-
ble, it‚Äôs always a good idea to power 
them oÔ¨Ä of motherboard ‚ÄúsyÔ¨Üem fan‚Äù 
plugs, rather than direly oÔ¨Ä the power 
supply. By supplying juice from the 
motherboard, the computer can control 
the speed of the fans based on its own 
temperature measurements, instead 
of simply running them at maximum 
power conÔ¨Üantly. 
Bad Vibrations
 Ever notice how your PC shivers 
whenever the CD-ROM spins up? Spin-
ning components such as optical drives 
As with many aspes of the tech-
nology world, there is a modder 
 subculture dedicated to quiet comput-
ing. (You can follow their obsessive 
eÔ¨Äorts on sites such as silentpcreview 
.com.) And wherever such subcultures 
exiÔ¨Ü, there is a market for produs that 
cater to them. In this case, it means 
there are plenty of options for lowering 
your computer‚Äôs volume. As a side ben-
efit, since the guiltiest noisemakers 
within a PC tend to be part of the cool-
ing apparatus, much of the same equip-
ment that can hush a computer will also 
increase its cooling eÔ¨Éciency‚Äîand can 
even shave a few watts oÔ¨Ä its power 
consumption to boot.
Before we get to the nitty-gritty tips 
and tricks, let‚Äôs dispense with the bad 
news: Laptops, the moÔ¨Ü popular kind 
of computer right now, are so hard to 
quiet down that it‚Äôs not worth trying for 
moÔ¨Ü end users. A considerable amount 
of eÔ¨Äort goes into engineering laptops 
that can run quietly, but that is largely a 
challenge for manufaurers. And the 
moÔ¨Ü obvious way of quieting a laptop‚Äî
using it on top of a pillow‚Äîcan have 
dire consequences for the machine‚Äôs 
ability to dissipate heat.
Desktop computers, however, are 
easy to shush. And how quiet you can 
make your desktop is entirely dependent 
upon how much money, time and eÔ¨Äort 
you‚Äôre willing to throw at the problem. 
So let‚Äôs tackle the challenge by degrees.
e Easy StuÔ¨Ä
 A simple fa of Ô¨Çuid dynamics: A 
120-mm fan rotating at a low speed 
moves more air than a smaller fan run-
ning at top speed. Now consider that 
inside the average PC there are four to 
six 80-mm fans hard at work dispersing 
the heat generated by internal compo-
nents such as the CPU, chipset, graph-
ics processor and power supply. Keeping 
the computer cool is a good thing, but 
your PC doesn‚Äôt need to sound like it‚Äôs 
taxiing down the runway to do it. e PC 
we seleed for our own sound-baÔ¨Ñing 
experiment had a typical conÔ¨Åguration, 
with five 80-mm fans and two hard 
drives. We measured the noise level at 
up to 80 decibels (about the level of a 
telephone dial tone).
e Ô¨Åx for this sort of sonic overload 
is to simply replace those small, noisy 
blowers (rated at 32 dBA each) with 
larger, quieter ones. We swapped out 
110  M A R C H  2 0 1 0   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
P M  D I Y  T E C H  /// Q U I E T  C O M P U T I N G
 Cool Differently
You replaced your whiny fans 
with quiet ones, and you Ô¨Üill 
hear noise? It‚Äôs probably 
coming from the CPU heat 
sink, which has its own fan. If 
you‚Äôre willing to do a little 
motherboard modiÔ¨Åcation, try 
liquid cooling. e easieÔ¨Ü 
liquid kits are self-contained, 
such as the Corsair H50.
 Swaddle Your Hard Drive
Spinning hard drives can send 
vibrations through the case 
and rattle things that shouldn‚Äôt 
rattle. A simple Ô¨Åx is to buÔ¨Äer 
the screws that mount the 
drive to the case with rubber 
washers. Or inÔ¨Üall your hard 
drive in an enclosure such as 
the AeroCool AVN-1000 for 
total soundprooÔ¨Ång.
 Stick-on Soundproofing
e same Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä that squelches 
road noise in cars does 
wonders for personal 
computers. Dynamat sells 
cut-to-Ô¨Åt sound-barrier panels 
that peel and Ô¨Üick to the 
inside of the PC. Whatever 
you do, however, don‚Äôt block 
any of the air-intake or 
exhauÔ¨Ü vents.
 Get Bigger Fans
Replacing small 80-mm fans 
with larger, slower 120-mm 
fans goes a long way toward 
cutting noise and is one of the 
easieÔ¨Ü Ô¨Åxes to do. e old 
ones screw out, the new ones 
screw in, and you‚Äôre up and 
running in 10 minutes. To 
adjuÔ¨Ü speed manually, inÔ¨Üall 
a front-panel fan control.
Ditching  
Extra Decibels

and hard drives can communicate 
plenty of vibration to the computer‚Äôs 
case, and that translates direly into 
sound. ere are a variety of options for 
silencing these shakes and shudders. 
The 60-second fix is to take a screw-
driver and tighten all the screws holding 
in your drives (loose screws cause the 
loudeÔ¨Ü rattles) and apply a drop of rub-
ber cement over the top of the screws. 
With our teÔ¨Ü computer, we opted 
for a more meticulous solution, relo-
cating the hard drives away from the 
front of the case, installing silicone 
bushings under hard-drive screws and 
placing silicone rubber jackets (like the 
ones used in iPod cases) over the hard 
drives, power supply and fans to 
reduce metal-to-metal conta. A Ô¨Üep 
up from simple dampers is to com-
pletely enclose your hard drives inside 
sound-isolating cases, such as the 
AeroCool AVN-1000 ($35). These 
boxes surround the drives with foam 
and aluminum (for heat dissipation), 
making them far quieter. One draw-
back to this approach: Sound- 
isolating boxes are too large to Ô¨Åt in 
Ô¨Üandard 3.5-inch hard-drive bays, so 
you‚Äôll need to mount your hard-drive-in-
a-box in a 5.25-inch drive bay.
Zero-Tolerance  
Sound Damping 
 ere‚Äôs a curious eÔ¨Äort-to-results 
ratio to PC sound control. Easy Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä 
such as changing out fans and putting 
rubber gaskets on drives will take care 
of 90 percent of your noise. Eliminating 
the laÔ¨Ü 10 percent requires consider-
ably more work‚Äîbut once you go down 
the quiet-PC path, the quest can 
become addiive. 
With our PC, we decided that a few 
more steps were appropriate. We 
applied sheets of Dynamat (a peel-and-
Ô¨Üick sound-absorbent foam Ô¨Ålm that is 
usually used to kill road noise in cars) to 
several acoustically vulnerable areas 
inside our case. e company sells a 
cut-to-Ô¨Åt PC kit for $30. 
at made a noticeable diÔ¨Äerence, 
but when liÔ¨Üening closely, we could Ô¨Üill 
hear the whir of the CPU heat-sink fan 
spinning. e guaranteed way to cut out 
heat-sink noise and draÔ¨Üically improve 
cooling is a liquid-cooling syÔ¨Üem (some-
times called water cooling). Usually, 
that‚Äôs a pretty elaborate proje, but we 
made things easy by using Corsair‚Äôs pre-
built, self-contained Hydro Series H50 
water-cooling kit ($90). The H50 
requires a little tinkering with the 
mother board to attach the water block 
to your CPU, and you have to bolt its 
small radiator over one of the case fans, 
but it is remarkably easier than the tra-
ditional DIY approach to liquid cooling, 
which involves cutting hoses and Ô¨Ålling 
the syÔ¨Üem with glycol.
All of our fan-swapping and 
vibration- damping eÔ¨Äorts reduced the 
maximum acouÔ¨Üic output to the point 
where it hardly showed up on our 
sound meter, which had a low-end 
range of 50 dBA. Only once, when we 
positioned our meter within 2 inches 
of the fans, did we get a reading of 51 
dBA (a whisper is generally rated at 40 
dBA). at was a level suÔ¨Écient for us 
to declare our work complete.
However, for the intelleually curi-
ous, it is possible to create a truly 
noiseless PC. To do so requires using 
nothing but solid-Ô¨Üate drives (SSDs) 
for data Ô¨Üorage and passively cooling 
all the hot bits (graphics processor, 
CPU, power supply) with a specially 
designed case. If you are so inclined, 
be warned, your obsession will cost  
you hundreds of dollars in low-capacity 
SSDs and may require submerging all 
of your components in a tank of min-
eral oil. Now that‚Äôs crazy quiet. 
FC
It‚Äôs really fast.  
WiGig, a wireless network-
ing protocol that should 
show up in equipment this 
year, is like Wi-Fi times 10. 
WiGig is based on a variant 
of Wi-Fi‚Äôs underlying IEEE 
802.11 networking protocol 
known as 802.11ad, which 
operates at the very high- 
frequency range of 60 GHz. 
But while the faÔ¨ÜeÔ¨Ü Wi-Fi 
Ô¨Üandard (802.11n) maxes 
out at 600 megabits per 
second, WiGig has a maxi- 
mum data throughput of 7 
gigabits per second, which 
puts it on a par with some of 
the faÔ¨ÜeÔ¨Ü wired networks.
It‚Äôs not a replacement  
for Wi-Fi.  
WiGig and Wi-Fi are 
complementary technolo-
gies. WiGig doesn‚Äôt have the 
whole-house 300-foot-
radius range that Wi-Fi does. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more of an in-room 
transmission technology,‚Äù 
says Mark Grodzinsky of  
the WiGig Alliance. So look 
for equipment that 
combines the two Ô¨Üan-
dards‚Äîusing Wi-Fi for basic 
networking, and WiGig for 
high-bandwidth short hops. 
Plus, WiGig is designed to 
make ad hoc (i.e., device-to-
device) networking easy and 
seamless, so that a 
smartphone, for inÔ¨Üance, 
could link direly to a 
computer to upload a movie 
Ô¨Åle without having to join a 
larger network.
What do we need that 
kind of speed for?  
Good queÔ¨Üion. Considering 
that moÔ¨Ü broadband 
Internet conneions 
operate in the 1.5- to 20- 
megabit-per-second range, 
WiGig isn‚Äôt going to make 
Web surÔ¨Ång any faÔ¨Üer. But 
AV equipment will see 
deÔ¨Ånite beneÔ¨Åts. WiGig can 
serve as a wireless conduit 
for HDMI conneions 
(current wireless HDMI tech 
is specialized and expen-
sive), moving hi-def Ô¨Üreams 
from Blu-ray players or com-
puters to TVs. WiGig can 
also enable networked 
displays, so that any PC in a 
room can conne cable-
free to a WiGig-enabled 
screen. Still, WiGig is not 
ensured success‚Äîmany 
people already have a 
wireless-network setup that 
works juÔ¨Ü Ô¨Åne for their 
needs. For them, WiGig‚Äôs 
big- bandwidth pipe may 
seem like drinking out of a 
Ô¨Åre hose.  ‚Äî GLENN DERENE

e Future of 
Call Forwarding
A
With today‚Äôs mishmash of land-
lines, oÔ¨Éce phones and personal 
and company-issued cellphones, people 
who aren‚Äôt forced to juggle multiple 
phones (and multiple phone numbers) 
have become an endangered species. 
Google Voice is undoubtedly the best 
way to manage this mess. 
Chances are good you‚Äôve heard of 
Google Voice‚Äîthe service Ô¨Üarted in 
2005 under the name GrandCentral 
before Google bought it in 2007 and 
relaunched it last March as Google 
Voice‚Äîbut it‚Äôs amazing how many 
people ask me juÔ¨Ü what it is and what 
it does. Fa is, this is such a complex 
and feature-Ô¨Ålled service that it really 
isn‚Äôt easy to explain in a single Ô¨Üate-
ment. e easieÔ¨Ü approach is to think 
of it as call forwarding on Ô¨Üeroids‚Äîa 
service that takes all incoming calls 
and automatically routes them to the 
proper phone (or phones), depending 
on who‚Äôs calling. 
is lets you cut the numbers you 
give out down to a single set of digits (a 
new number that‚Äôs given to you for free 
by Google) that you can distribute to 
anybody. Your boss is calling? Google 
Voice can forward the call to your work 
phone. A client? Have the call go Ô¨Üraight 
to your cellphone. Your mother? All your 
phones can ring, simultaneously.
Awesome? DeÔ¨Ånitely. I‚Äôve been using 
the service since it Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü launched, and 
it‚Äôs now the only phone number of mine 
that moÔ¨Ü people know. e beÔ¨Ü part: 
Like virtually every other Google service, 
it‚Äôs free‚Äîalthough, as of press time, the 
service was still invite-only, so you‚Äôll 
need to find somebody else with an 
account who can give you an invitation.
e Google Voice magic doesn‚Äôt end 
there. Even people who have no intereÔ¨Ü 
in consolidating calls to a single number 
can probably Ô¨Ånd something useful in 
Google Voice. For example, Google 
Voice revives an old answering machine

Between my work and 
personal lives, I juggle no 
fewer than four diÔ¨Äerent 
phone numbers. Is there a 
simple way of making it easier 
to handle all these phones?
by Seth Porges
How Google Voice Works
1:  You give everyone you know the same phone number.  
2:  Depending on who is calling, Google Voice will automatically forward the 
call to the phone or phones of your choice.  
3:  Voicemails are transcribed and e-mailed to you for quick viewing.

by, well, tapping it. Trouble is, it‚Äôs 
extremely sensitive and, in my experi-
ence, is very prone to miÔ¨Üaking care-
less palm brushes for clicks‚Äîan 
incredibly aggravating experience 
when you‚Äôre trying to type, and one 
that is oen exacerbated in netbooks 
by the close proximity of the trackpad 
to the keyboard.
While trackpad tapping is often 
turned on by default, it‚Äôs easy to turn 
oÔ¨Ä. Go to your Windows Control Panel, 
click Mouse (yes, we know your track-
pad isn‚Äôt technically a mouse), and look 
for a setting called Enable Tapping. 
Depending on your machine, you may 
also have to click on a menu item 
called Other Pointing Devices and 
sele your trackpad. Either way, once 
you Ô¨Ånd the Enable Tapping setting, 
disable it. Your problem is now solved.
Macs are not nearly as prone to this 
issue as are Windows machines (one 
reason: There are no cramped Apple 
netbooks yet), but Mac users can Ô¨Üill 
eliminate the problem by clicking on 
SyÔ¨Üem Preferences, seleing Trackpad 
and checking the box next to Ignore 
Accidental Trackpad Input.

mainÔ¨Üay that we sometimes miss: the 
ability to liÔ¨Üen in as somebody leaves 
a voicemail and pick up halfway 
through the message. It even allows 
you to transfer a conversation from 
one phone to another, midcall, as long 
as both numbers are linked to the 
same Google Voice account.
Even better is the way Google 
Voice treats voicemail. e iPhone‚Äôs 
Visual Voicemail feature has drawn 
acclaim for allowing users to inÔ¨Üantly 
pull up and play whichever voicemail 
they want. Google Voice takes it a 
Ô¨Üep further‚Äînot only does it let you 
play individual messages on demand 
(either on your phone or through the 
Web), but it aually transcribes your 
voicemails and gives you the option of 
receiving the transcription as an 
e-mail. (You might say it takes the 
voice out of voicemail.) For now, the 
automatic transcription service is 
very, very far from perfe (it‚Äôs prone 
to pretty hilarious mistakes), but it 
usually gets enough words right that 
I‚Äôm able to get the giÔ¨Ü of a message 
at a glance.
Tricky Trackpad 
My netbook has a cramped key-
board that causes my hand to 
regularly rub up againÔ¨Ü the

e world‚Äôs moÔ¨Ü famous dog sled race is the Iditarod, an 1100-mile trek across 
Alaska. But Egil Ellis prefers brutal 20- to 30-mile short-diÔ¨Üance races. e Swede is 
very good at sprints: He and his dogs‚Äîa cross between German shorthaired pointers and 
Alaskan huskies‚Äîhave won the three-day GCI Open North American Championship in 
Fairbanks a record-breaking nine times. Racing season runs December through April; the 
reÔ¨Ü of the year Ellis operates a kennel. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working with your beÔ¨Ü friends,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúAer years of breeding, training and caring for these dogs, you‚Äôre Ô¨Üanding on the Ô¨Üarting 
line of a big race. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling.‚Äù  ‚Äî EMILY HAILE

Ellis‚Äôs pointer‚Äìhusky cross 
produces pups with long legs 
and more muscle than regular 
huskies. ‚Äúe hybrid is very ath-
letic,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA super dog.‚Äù

e dogs‚Äô Dragr√•ttan har-
nesses are made of padded 
nylon webbing that goes 
around the neck and along the 
body, ending at the root of the 
tail. A tug line is hooked to 
the harness and the Kevlar-
reinforced main line. ‚Äúe lines 
can be 80 feet long,‚Äù Ellis 
says. ‚ÄùOn winding corners, you 
only see half your team. It‚Äôs 
exhilarating.‚Äù

Ellis mushes with the Bewe 
ALPI-S. Made of aluminum, 
wood, plaÔ¨Üic and carbon Ô¨Åber, 
the sled weighs 22 pounds 
and can hold two injured or 
tired dogs. When Ellis wants 
to maintain high speeds going 
uphill, he runs behind the sled 
and pushes.

Ellis has gear for weather 
conditions from 40 degrees F 
to minus 40, including a down 
parka and windproof coveralls. 
Alaskan crasmen make 
him heavy-duty mittens (not 
shown) of beaver fur or moose 
hide with a sheepskin liner.   
5. q   
It‚Äôs diÔ¨Écult to Ô¨Üop quickly 
when 10 to 20 dogs are run-
ning at an average of 20 mph. 
Ellis counts on this Norwegian 
IÔ¨Üind snow hook to a as a 
parking brake. e 5-pound 
hook has two Ô¨Üeel claws that 
penetrate the snow, Ô¨Üopping 
the team and holding the sled 
and dogs in place.
