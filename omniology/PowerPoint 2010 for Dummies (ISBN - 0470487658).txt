About the Author
Doug Lowe has written enough computer books to line all the birdcages in 
California. His other books include Word 2010 All-in-One For Dummies, Java 
All-in-One For Dummies, and Networking For Dummies, 9th Edition.
Although Doug has yet to win a Pulitzer Prize, he remains cautiously optimis-
tic. He is hopeful that James Cameron will pick up the fi lm rights to this book 
and suggests Avatar II: The Phantom Presentation as a working title.
Doug lives in sunny Fresno, California, which is kind of boring but fortunately 
close to non-boring places like Disneyland, Yosemite, and San Francisco. 
Dedication
To Rebecca, Sarah, and Bethany.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank the whole crew at Wiley who helped with this edition, espe-
cially Kim Darosett who did a great job keeping the entire project moving 
along when deadlines came and chapters didn’t. Copy editor Virginia Sanders 
dotted all the t’s and crossed all the i’s, or something like that, and managed 
to get my crude prose readable. Stuart Stuple gave the entire manuscript a 
thorough technical review and made many excellent suggestions. And, of 
course, many other people pitched in.
I’d also like to thank everyone who helped out with previous editions of 
this book: Mark Enochs Kala Schrager, Jennifer Riggs, Rebecca Mancilla, 
Doug Sahlin, Andrea Boucher, Garret Pease, Steve Hayes, Kel Oliver, 
Nancy DelFavero, Grace Jasmine, Rev Mengle, Tina Sims, Pam Mourouzis, 
Leah Cameron, Jim McCarter, Kezia Endsley, Becky Whitney, and Michael 
Partington.

PowerPoint 2010 For Dummies 
xvi

Introduction
W
elcome to PowerPoint 2010 For Dummies, the book written especially 
for people who are lucky enough to use this latest and greatest ver-
sion of PowerPoint and want to find out just enough to finish that presenta-
tion that was due yesterday.
Do you ever find yourself in front of an audience, no matter how small, flip-
ping through flip charts or shuffling through a stack of handwritten trans-
parencies? You need PowerPoint! Have you always wanted to take your 
notebook computer with you to impress a client at lunch, but you haven’t 
known what to do with it between trips to the salad bar? You really need 
PowerPoint!
Or maybe you’re one of those unfortunate folks who bought Microsoft Office 
because it was such a bargain and you needed a Windows word processor 
and spreadsheet anyway, and hey, you’re not even sure what PowerPoint is, 
but it was free. Who can resist a bargain like that?
Whichever circumstance you find yourself in, you’re holding the perfect book 
right here in your formerly magic-marker-stained hands. Help is here, within 
these humble pages.
This book talks about PowerPoint in everyday — and often irreverent — 
terms. No lofty prose here; the whole thing checks in at about the fifth-grade 
reading level. I have no Pulitzer expectations for this book. My goal is to 
make an otherwise dull and lifeless subject at least tolerable, and maybe even 
kind of fun.
About This Book
This isn’t the kind of book that you pick up and read from start to finish as 
though it were a cheap novel. If I ever see you reading it at the beach, I’ll kick 
sand in your face. This book is more like a reference — the kind of book you 
can pick up, turn to just about any page, and start reading. It has 24 chapters, 
each one covering a specific aspect of using PowerPoint — such as printing, 
animating your slides, or using clip art.

2
PowerPoint 2010 For Dummies 
Each chapter is divided into self-contained chunks, all related to the major 
theme of the chapter.
For example, the chapter on using charts contains nuggets like these:
 
✓ Understanding charts
 
✓ Adding a chart to your presentation
 
✓ Pasting a chart from Excel
 
✓ Changing the chart type
 
✓ Working with chart data
You don’t have to memorize anything in this book. It’s a need-to-know book: 
You pick it up when you need to know something. Need to know how to 
create an organization chart? Pick up the book. Need to know how to over-
ride the Slide Master? Pick up the book. After you find what you’re looking 
for, put it down and get on with your life.
How to Use This Book
This book works like a reference. Start with the topic that you want to find 
out about: To get going, look for it in the table of contents or in the index. 
The table of contents is detailed enough that you should be able to find most 
of the topics that you look for. If not, turn to the index, where you find even 
more detail.
When you find your topic in the table of contents or the index, turn to the 
area of interest and read as much or as little as you need or want. Then close 
the book and get on with it.
This book is loaded with information, of course, so if you want to take a brief 
excursion into your topic, you’re more than welcome. If you want to know all 
about Slide Masters, read the chapter on templates and Masters. If you want 
to know all about animation, read the chapter on animation. Read whatever 
you want. This is your book — not mine.
On occasion, this book directs you to use specific keyboard shortcuts to 
get things done. When you see something like Ctrl+Z, this instruction means 
to hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the Z key and then release both 
together. Don’t type the plus sign.
Sometimes I tell you to use a command that resides on the new ribbon inter-
face like this: Choose Home➪Editing➪Find. That means to click the Find 
button, which you can find in the Editing group on the Home tab.

 Introduction
Whenever I describe a message or information that you see onscreen, it looks 
like this:
Are we having fun yet?
Anything you’re instructed to type appears in bold like so: Type a:setup in 
the Run dialog box. Type exactly what you see, with or without spaces.
Another nice feature of this book is that whenever I discuss a certain button 
that you need to click in order to accomplish the task at hand, the button 
appears either in the margin or in a helpful table that summarizes the but-
tons that apply to a particular task. This way, you can easily locate it on your 
screen.
What You Don’t Need to Read
Some parts of this book are skippable. I carefully place extra-technical infor-
mation in self-contained sidebars and clearly mark them so that you can give 
them a wide berth. Don’t read this stuff unless you just gots to know. Don’t 
worry; I won’t be offended if you don’t read every word.
Foolish Assumptions
I make only three assumptions about you:
 
✓ You use a computer.
 
✓ It’s a Windows computer — not a Macintosh.
 
✓ You use or are thinking about using PowerPoint 2010.
Nothing else. I don’t assume that you’re a computer guru who knows how to 
change a controller card or configure memory for optimal use. These types of 
computer chores are best handled by people who like computers. My hope is 
that you’re on speaking terms with such a person. Do your best to stay there.
How This Book Is Organized
Inside this book are chapters arranged in six parts. Each chapter is broken 
down into sections that cover various aspects of the chapter’s main subject. 
The chapters have a logical sequence, so it makes sense to read them in 

4
PowerPoint 2010 For Dummies 
order if you want. But you don’t have to read the book that way; you can flip 
it open to any page and start reading.
Here’s the lowdown on what’s in each of the five parts:
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff
In this part, you review the basics of using PowerPoint. This is a good place 
to start if you’re clueless about what PowerPoint is, let alone how to use it.
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides
The chapters in this part show you how to make presentations that look 
good. Most important are the chapters about themes (Chapter 9), and 
Masters and templates (Chapter 11). Get the theme, template, and Masters 
right, and everything else falls into place.
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides
One of the nifty new features of PowerPoint 2010 is the Insert tab on the 
Ribbon. It’s loaded with things you can insert into your presentations. The 
chapters in this part explore the various goodies to be found here, such as 
pictures, clip art, charts, SmartArt objects, sounds, movies, tables, Ginsu 
knives, and more!
Part IV: Working with Others
The chapters in this part show you how to use PowerPoint’s many collabora-
tion features, such as using revision tracking tools, creating slide libraries, 
using the new presentation broadcasting feature, and creating a video from 
your presentation.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without lists of interesting snippets: 
ten PowerPoint commandments, ten tips for creating readable slides, ten 
ways to keep your audience awake, and ten things that often go wrong (my 
all-time favorite).

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
As you’re reading all this wonderful prose, you occasionally see the following 
icons. They appear in the margins to draw your attention to important infor-
mation. They’re defined as follows:
 
Watch out! Some technical drivel is just around the corner. Read it only if you 
have your pocket protector firmly attached.
 
Pay special attention to this icon — it tells you that some particularly useful 
tidbit is at hand, perhaps a shortcut or a way of using a command that you 
might not have considered.
 
Danger! Danger! Danger! Stand back, Will Robinson!
 
Did I tell you about the memory course I took? Paragraphs marked with this 
icon simply point out details that are worth committing to memory.
Where to Go from Here
Yes, you can get there from here. With this book in hand, you’re ready to 
charge full speed ahead into the strange and wonderful world of desktop pre-
sentations. Browse through the table of contents and decide where you want 
to start. Be bold! Be courageous! Be adventurous! Above all else, have fun!

Basic PowerPoint 
2010 Stuff

In this part . . .
O
nce upon a time, the term presentation software 
meant poster board and marker pens. Now, how-
ever, programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint enable you 
to create spectacular presentations on your computer.
The chapters in this part compose a bare-bones introduc-
tion to PowerPoint. You find out exactly what PowerPoint 
is and how to use it to create simple presentations. More-
advanced stuff, such as adding charts or using fancy text 
fonts, is covered in later parts. This part is just the begin-
ning. As a great king once advised, it is best to begin at 
the beginning and go on until you come to the end; then 
stop.

Chapter 1
Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering PowerPoint
▶ Firing up PowerPoint
▶ Making sense of the PowerPoint screen and the Ribbon
▶ Visiting backstage
▶ Creating a presentation
▶ Viewing presentation outlines
▶ Saving and closing your work
▶ Retrieving a presentation from the hard drive
▶ Getting out of PowerPoint
T
his chapter is a grand and gala welcoming ceremony for PowerPoint 
2010, Microsoft’s popular slide-presentation program.
This chapter is sort of like the opening ceremony of the Olympics, in which 
all the athletes parade around the stadium and people make speeches in 
French. In much the same way, this chapter marches PowerPoint 2010 
around the stadium so you can get a bird’s-eye view of what the program is 
and what you can do with it. I might make a few speeches, but not in French 
(unless, of course, you’re reading the French edition of this book).
What in Sam Hill Is PowerPoint?
PowerPoint is a program that comes with Microsoft Office (although you 
can buy it separately, as well). Most people buy Microsoft Office because it’s 
a great bargain: You get Word, Excel, and Outlook all together in one inex-
pensive package. And PowerPoint is thrown in for good measure. Of course, 
depending on which edition of Office you buy, you might get other goodies as 
well, such as Access, Publisher, a complete set of Ginsu knives, and a Binford 
VegaPneumatic Power Slicer and Dicer. (Always wear eye protection.)

10
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
You know what Word is — it’s the world’s most loved and most hated word 
processor, and it’s perfect for concocting letters, term papers, and great 
American novels. I’m thinking of writing one as soon as I finish this book. 
Excel is a spreadsheet program used by bean counters the world over. 
Outlook is that program you use to read your e-mail. But what the heck is 
PowerPoint? Does anybody know or care? (And as long as I’m asking ques-
tions, who in Sam Hill was Sam Hill?)
PowerPoint is a presentation program, and it’s one of the coolest programs I 
know. It’s designed to work with a projector to display presentations that will 
bedazzle your audience members and instantly sway them to your point of 
view, even if you’re selling real estate on Mars, season tickets for the Oakland 
Raiders, or a new healthcare plan to Congress. If you’ve ever flipped a flip 
chart, you’re going to love PowerPoint.
Here are some of the many uses of PowerPoint:
 
✓ Business presentations: PowerPoint is a great timesaver for anyone who 
makes business presentations, whether you’ve been asked to speak in 
front of hundreds of people at a shareholders’ convention, a group of 
sales reps at a sales conference, or your own staff or co-workers at a 
business meeting.
 
✓ Sales presentations: If you’re an insurance salesperson, you can use 
PowerPoint to create a presentation about the perils of not owning life 
insurance and then use your laptop to show it to hapless clients.
 
✓ Lectures: PowerPoint is also useful for teachers or conference speakers 
who want to reinforce the key points in their lectures with slides.
 
✓ Homework: PowerPoint is a great program to use for certain types of 
homework projects, such as those big history reports that count for half 
your grade.
 
✓ Church: People use PowerPoint at churches to display song lyrics on big 
screens so everyone can sing or to display sermon outlines so everyone 
can take notes. If your church still uses hymnals or prints the outline in 
the bulletin, tell the minister to join the 21st century.
 
✓ Information stations: You can use PowerPoint to set up a computerized 
information kiosk that people can walk up to and use. For example, you 
can create a museum exhibit about the history of your town or set up 
a tradeshow presentation to provide information about your company 
and products.
 
✓ Internet presentations: PowerPoint can even help you to set up a pre-
sentation that you can broadcast over the Internet so people can join 
in on the fun without having to leave the comfort of their own homes or 
offices.

11
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
Introducing PowerPoint Presentations
PowerPoint is similar to a word processor such as Word, except that it’s 
geared toward creating presentations rather than documents. A presentation 
is kind of like those Kodak Carousel slide trays that your father used to load 
up with 35mm slides of your family trip to the Grand Canyon. The main dif-
ference is that you don’t have to worry about dumping all the slides in your 
PowerPoint presentation out of the tray and onto the floor.
Word documents consist of one or more pages, and PowerPoint presenta-
tions consist of one or more slides. Each slide can contain text, graphics, 
and other information. You can easily rearrange the slides in a presentation, 
delete slides that you don’t need, add new slides, or modify the contents of 
existing slides.
You can use PowerPoint both to create your presentations and to actually 
present them.
You can use several different types of media to actually show your 
presentations:
 
✓ Computer monitor: Your computer monitor is a suitable way to dis-
play your presentation when you’re showing it to just one or two other 
people.
 
✓ Big-screen TV: If you have a big-screen TV that can accommodate 
computer input, it’s ideal for showing presentations to medium-sized 
audiences — say 10 to 12 people in a small conference room.
 
✓ Computer projector: A computer projector projects an image of your 
computer monitor onto a screen so large audiences can view it.
 
✓ Overhead transparencies: Overhead transparencies can be used to 
show your presentation using an overhead projector.
 
✓ Printed pages: Printed pages allow you to distribute a printed copy of 
your entire presentation to each member of your audience. (When you 
print your presentation, you can print one slide per page, or you can 
print several slides on each page to save paper.)
 
✓ 35mm slides: For a fee, you can have your presentation printed onto 
35mm slides either by a local company or over the Internet. Then, your 
presentation really is like a Kodak Carousel slide tray! It’s a little old 
school to be sure, but some people still do it this way.
Your presentations will be much more interesting if you show them using one 
of the first three methods (computer monitor, TV, or projector) because you 

12
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
can incorporate animations, videos, sounds, and other whiz-bang features in 
your presentation. The last three (transparencies, printed pages, and 35mm 
slides) can show just static content.
Presentation files
A presentation is to PowerPoint what a document is to Word or a worksheet 
is to Excel. In other words, a presentation is a file that you create with 
PowerPoint. Each presentation that you create is saved on your computer’s 
hard drive as a separate file.
PowerPoint 2010 presentations have the special extension .pptx added 
to the end of their filenames. For example, Sales Conference.pptx and 
History Day.pptx are both valid PowerPoint filenames. When you type 
the filename for a new PowerPoint file, you don’t have to type the .pptx 
extension, because PowerPoint automatically adds the extension for you. 
Windows may hide the .pptx extension, in which case a presentation file 
named Conference.pptx often appears as just Conference.
 
Versions of PowerPoint prior to 2007 saved presentations with the extension 
.ppt instead of .pptx. The x at the end of the new file extension denotes that 
the new file format is based on an open XML standard data format that makes 
it easier to exchange files among different programs. PowerPoint 2010 can still 
save files in the old .ppt format, but I recommend you do so only if you need 
to share presentations with people who haven’t yet upgraded to PowerPoint 
2007. (You can download a program called the Microsoft Office Compatibility 
Pack from www.microsoft.com that enables PowerPoint 2002 or 2003 to 
read and write files in .pptx format. This program enables you to share your 
.pptx files with people who haven’t yet upgraded.)
PowerPoint is set up initially to save your presentation files in the My 
Documents folder, but you can store PowerPoint files in any folder of your 
choice on your hard drive or on any other drive. You can write a presenta-
tion to a CD-RW drive or to a removable USB flash drive if you want to take 
it home with you to work on or if you need to give it to other people so they 
can use it on their computers.
What’s in a slide?
PowerPoint presentations comprise one or more slides. Each slide can con-
tain text, graphics, and other elements. A number of PowerPoint features 
work together to help you easily format attractive slides:

13
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
 
✓ Slide layouts: Every slide has a slide layout that controls how informa-
tion is arranged on the slide. A slide layout is simply a collection of one 
or more placeholders, which set aside an area of the slide to hold infor-
mation. Depending on the layout that you choose for a slide, the place-
holders can hold text, graphics, clip art, sound or video files, tables, 
charts, graphs, diagrams, or other types of content.
 
✓ Background: Every slide has a background, which provides a backdrop 
for the slide’s content. The background can be a solid color; a blend of 
two colors; a subtle texture, such as marble or parchment; a pattern, 
such as diagonal lines, bricks, or tiles; or an image file. Each slide can 
have a different background, but you usually want to use the same back-
ground for every slide in your presentation to provide a consistent look.
 
✓ Themes: Themes are combinations of design elements such as color 
schemes and fonts that make it easy to create attractive slides that don’t 
look ridiculous. You can stray from the themes if you want, but you 
should do so only if you have a better eye than the design gurus that 
work for Microsoft.
 
✓ Slide Masters: Slide Masters are special slides that control the basic 
design and formatting options for slides in your presentation. Slide 
Masters are closely related to layouts — in fact, each layout has its own 
Slide Master that determines the position and size of basic title and text 
placeholders; the background and color scheme used for the presenta-
tion; and font settings, such as typefaces, colors, and sizes. In addition, 
Slide Masters can contain graphic and text objects that you want to 
appear on every slide.
 
 You can edit the Slide Masters to change the appearance of all the slides 
in your presentation at once. This helps to ensure that the slides have a 
consistent appearance.
All the features described in the previous list work together to control the 
appearance of your slides in much the same way that style sheets and tem-
plates control the appearance of Word documents. You can customize the 
appearance of individual slides by adding any of the following elements:
 
✓ Title and body text: Most slide layouts include placeholders for title and 
body text. You can type any text that you want into these placeholders. 
By default, PowerPoint formats the text according to the Slide Master, 
but you can easily override this formatting to use any font, size, styles 
like bold or italic, or text color that you want.
 
✓ Text boxes: You can add text anywhere on a slide by drawing a text box 
and then typing text. Text boxes allow you to add text that doesn’t fit 
conveniently in the title or body text placeholders.

14
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
✓ Shapes: You can use PowerPoint’s drawing tools to add a variety of 
shapes to your slides. You can use predefined AutoShapes, such as rect-
angles, circles, stars, arrows, and flowchart symbols. Alternatively, you 
can create your own shapes by using basic line, polygon, and freehand 
drawing tools.
 
✓ Illustrations: You can illustrate your slides by inserting clip art, photo-
graphs, and other graphic elements. PowerPoint comes with a large col-
lection of clip art pictures you can use, and Microsoft provides an even 
larger collection of clip art images online.
 
✓ Charts and diagrams: PowerPoint includes a slick diagramming feature 
called SmartArt that enables you to create several common types of 
diagrams, including organization charts, cycle diagrams, and others. In 
addition, you can insert pie charts, line or bar charts, and many other 
chart types.
 
✓ Media clips: You can add sound clips or video files to your slides.
Starting PowerPoint
Here’s the procedure for starting PowerPoint:
 
1. Get ready.
 
 Light some votive candles. Take two Tylenol. Put on a pot of coffee. If 
you’re allergic to banana slugs, take an allergy pill. Sit in the lotus posi-
tion facing Redmond, Washington, and recite the Windows creed three 
times:
 
 Bill Gates is my friend. Resistance is futile. No beer and no TV make Homer 
something something. . . .
 
2. Click the Start button.
 
 The Start button is ordinarily found in the lower-left corner of the 
Windows display. When you click it, the famous Start menu appears. 
The Start menu works pretty much the same, no matter which version of 
Windows you’re using.
 
 If you can’t find the Start button, try moving the cursor all the way to the 
bottom edge of the screen and holding it there a moment. With luck on 
your side, you see the Start button appear. If not, try moving the cursor 
to the other three edges of the screen: top, left, and right. Sometimes the 
Start button hides behind these edges.
 
3. Point to All Programs on the Start menu.
 
 After you click the Start button to reveal the Start menu, move the 
cursor up to the word All Programs and hold it there a moment. Yet 
another menu appears, revealing a bevy of commands.

15
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
 
4. Choose Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2010.
 
 Your computer whirs and clicks and possibly makes other unmention-
able noises while PowerPoint comes to life.
 
If you use PowerPoint frequently, it might appear in the Frequently Used 
Programs list directly on the Start menu so you don’t have to choose All 
Programs➪Microsoft Office to get to it. If you want PowerPoint to always 
appear at the top of the Start menu, choose Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft 
Office. Then, right-click Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2010 and choose the Pin 
to Start Menu command.
 
If you hate clicking through menus but don’t mind typing, another way to start 
PowerPoint is to press your keyboard’s Windows key (usually found between 
the Ctrl and Alt keys), type the word powerpoint, and press the Enter key. 
(Note that this trick works only in Vista or Windows 7.)
Navigating the PowerPoint Interface
When you start PowerPoint, it greets you with a screen that’s so cluttered 
with stuff that you’re soon ready to consider newsprint and markers as a 
viable alternative for your presentations. The center of the screen is merci-
fully blank, but the top part of the screen is chock-full of little icons and but-
tons and doohickies. What is all that stuff?
Figure 1-1 shows the basic PowerPoint screen in all its cluttered glory. The 
following list points out the more important parts of the PowerPoint screen:
 
✓ The Ribbon: Across the top of the screen, just below the Microsoft 
PowerPoint title, is PowerPoint’s main user-interface gadget, called the 
Ribbon. If you’ve worked with earlier versions of PowerPoint, you were 
probably expecting to see a menu followed by one or more toolbars 
in this general vicinity. After meticulous research, Microsoft gurus 
decided that menus and toolbars are hard to use. So they replaced the 
menus and toolbars with the Ribbon, which combines the functions 
of both. The Ribbon takes some getting used to, but after you figure it 
out, it actually does become easier to use than the old menus and tool-
bars. The deepest and darkest secrets of PowerPoint are hidden on the 
Ribbon. Wear a helmet when exploring it.
 
 Note that the exact appearance of the Ribbon varies a bit depending on 
the size of your monitor. On smaller monitors, PowerPoint may com-
press the Ribbon a bit by using smaller buttons and arranging them 
differently (for example, stacking them on top of one another instead of 
placing them side by side).

 For more information about working with the Ribbon, see the section 
“Unraveling the Ribbon,” later in this chapter.
 
 Although PowerPoint 2010 has done away with the menus, the keyboard 
shortcuts (technically called accelerators) that were associated with the 
PowerPoint 2003 menu commands still work. However, instead of press-
ing Alt and the accelerator key at the same time, you press them sepa-
rately. For example, to call up the Open dialog box, press Alt, F, and O 
(for the old File➪Open command). And to insert clip art, press Alt, I, P, 
and C (for the old Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art command).
 
✓ The File tab: The first tab on the Ribbon is called the File tab. You can 
click it to switch the program into a special mode called Backstage View, 
which provides access to various functions such as opening and saving 
files, creating new presentations, printing, and other similar chores. For 
more information, see the section “Taking the Backstage Tour,” later in 
this chapter.

17
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
 
✓ Quick Access toolbar: Just to the right of the File tab is the Quick Access 
toolbar, also called the QAT for short. Its sole purpose in life is to pro-
vide a convenient resting place for the PowerPoint commands you use 
the most often.
 
 Initially, this toolbar contains just three: Save, Undo, and Redo. However, 
you can add more buttons if you want. To add any button to the QAT, 
right-click the button and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. You can 
also find a pull-down menu at the end of the QAT that lists several fre-
quently used commands. You can use this menu to add these common 
commands to the QAT.
 
✓ Current slide: Right smack in the middle of the screen is where your 
current slide appears.
 
✓ Slides tab and Outline tab: To the left of the slide is an area that has 
two tabs, labeled Outline and Slides. The Slides tab shows thumbnail 
icons of your slides, and the Outline tab shows your presentation 
arranged as an outline. You can switch between the two tabs by clicking 
the tab you want to view. (For more information on working in Outline 
View, see Chapter 3.) The Slides tab, shown in Figure 1-1, shows little 
thumbnail images of your slides.
 
✓ Notes pane: Beneath the slide is a small area called the Notes pane, 
which you can use to add notes to your slides. For more information on 
using this feature, see Chapter 5.
 
✓ Task pane: To the right of the slide is an area called the task pane. 
The task pane is designed to help you complete common tasks quickly. 
When you first start PowerPoint, the task pane isn’t visible, so you can’t 
see it in Figure 1-1. However, it appears whenever it’s needed, and you 
can see plenty of examples of it throughout this book.
 
✓ Status bar: At the very bottom of the screen is the status bar, which tells 
you the slide that is currently displayed (for example, Slide 1 of 1).
 
 You can configure the status bar by right-clicking anywhere on it. This 
right-click reveals a list of options that you can select or deselect to 
determine which elements appear on the status bar.
 
✓ Zoom control: PowerPoint automatically adjusts its zoom factor so that 
Slide View displays each slide in its entirety. You can change the size of 
your slide by using the zoom control slider that appears at the bottom 
right of the window.
 
You’ll never get anything done if you feel that you have to understand every 
pixel of the PowerPoint screen before you can do anything. Don’t worry about 
the stuff that you don’t understand; just concentrate on what you need to 
know to get the job done and worry about the bells and whistles later.

Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Unraveling the Ribbon
The Ribbon is Microsoft’s new user-interface gadget for not just PowerPoint 
2010, but also Word 2010, Excel 2010, and Access 2010. The Ribbon replaces 
the menus and toolbars found in versions prior to 2007.
Across the top of the Ribbon is a series of tabs. You can click one of these 
tabs to reveal a set of controls specific to that tab. For example, the Ribbon 
in Figure 1-1 (earlier in the chapter) shows the Home tab. Figure 1-2 shows 
the Ribbon with the Insert tab selected.

Besides these basic tabs, additional tabs appear from time to time. For exam-
ple, if you select a picture, a Picture Tools tab appears with commands that 
let you manipulate the picture.
The commands on a Ribbon tab are organized into groups. Within each 
group, most of the commands are simple buttons that are similar to toolbar 
buttons in previous versions of PowerPoint.

 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
The View from Here Is Great
Near the right edge of the status bar is a series of three View buttons. These 
buttons enable you to switch among the various views, or ways of looking at 
your presentation. Table 1-2 summarizes what each View button does.

Button
What It Does
Switches to Normal View, which shows your slide, outline, and notes 
all at once. This is the default view for PowerPoint.
Switches to Slide Sorter View, which enables you to easily rearrange 
slides and add slide transitions and other special effects.
Switches to Reading View, which displays your slideshow within a 
window.
Switches to Slide Show View, which displays your slides in full-
screen mode. This is the view you’ll use when you’re actually giving 
your presentation.
Taking the Backstage Tour
Every June, my wife and I attend plays at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival 
in Ashland, Oregon. A few years ago, we took the special backstage tour, in 
which we learned all kinds of nifty secrets worthy of a Dan Brown novel.
This section takes a brief look at PowerPoint’s Backstage View feature, which 
provides access to document management features previously found on the 
File menu. When you click the File tab in the top-left corner of the PowerPoint 
window, PowerPoint switches to Backstage View, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Initially, Backstage View displays information about the current presentation. 
However, the menu on the left — which bears a striking resemblance to what 
used to be called the File menu back in the day when programs had plain 
menus instead of fancy ribbons — provides access to the hidden features of 
PowerPoint available only to those who venture backstage.
You find out how to use the most important of these commands later in this 
chapter, and several of the more advanced commands on this menu are pre-
sented in later chapters.

Okay, the only secret my wife and I learned on the backstage tour at Ashland 
that was really worthy of a Dan Brown novel is the one about Psalm 46 in the 
King James translation of the Bible, which was published in 1611 — when 
William Shakespeare turned 46. If you count 46 words from the start of the 
Psalm, you get the word Shake. And if you count 46 words backwards from 
the end of the psalm, you get the word Spear. Which clearly means that 
there’s a treasure buried directly beneath the stage in Ashland’s outdoor 
theater. Next year I’m taking a shovel.
Creating a New Presentation
When you first start PowerPoint, a new, blank presentation is created. The 
simplest way to create a new presentation is to start PowerPoint and then 
edit the blank presentation to your liking.
An alternative is to click the File tab to switch to Backstage View and then click 
the New command. This action brings up the screen shown in Figure 1-4, which 
offers several ways to create a new presentation:

21
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
 
Figure 1-4: 
On the New 
screen in 
Backstage 
View, you 
can find 
templates 
and themes.
 
 
✓ Blank Presentation: Double-click Blank Presentation to start a new pre-
sentation from scratch.
 
✓ Recent Templates: This section of the New screen lists templates you’ve 
recently used to create presentations. You can double-click any of these 
templates to create another presentation based on the template.
 
✓ Sample Templates: Click this item to display a list of sample templates 
provided with PowerPoint. When you create a presentation from a tem-
plate, the presentation inherits various design elements (collectively 
called the theme) as well as prewritten content that’s stored in the 
template.
 
✓ Sample Themes: Click this item to display a list of sample themes 
installed on your computer. Creating a presentation from a theme is 
similar to creating a presentation from a template, except that the new 
presentation doesn’t contain any prewritten content.
 
✓ My Templates: Click My Templates to bring up a separate dialog box 
that lets you locate templates to create your presentation from.
 
✓ New from Existing: Double-click New From Existing to create a new pre-
sentation based on an existing one. Use this option if you want to create 
a presentation that is similar to one that you created previously.

22
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
✓ Office Online Templates: Use this section of the New screen to select 
a template from Microsoft’s online Web site, which contains templates 
developed by the community of PowerPoint users, not by Microsoft 
itself. Note that the templates are arranged into categories, such as 
Agendas, Plans, and Presentations.
Notice that to the right of the palette of available templates and themes is a 
preview area that gives you a glimpse of what a presentation created with the 
currently selected template will look like.
Editing text
In PowerPoint, slides are blank areas that you can adorn with various objects. 
The most common type of object is a text placeholder, a rectangular area that’s 
specially designated for holding text. (Other types of objects include shapes, 
such as circles or triangles; pictures imported from clip art files; and graphs.)
Most slides contain two text objects: one for the slide’s title and the other for 
its body text. However, you can add more text objects if you want, and you 
can remove the body text or title text object. You can even remove both to 
create a slide that contains no text.
 
Whenever you move the cursor over a text object, the cursor changes from 
an arrow to the I-beam, which you can use to support bridges or build aircraft 
carriers. Seriously, when the cursor changes to an I-beam, you can click the 
mouse button and start typing text.
When you click a text object, a box appears around the text, and an insertion 
pointer appears at the spot where you clicked. PowerPoint then becomes 
like a word processor. Any characters that you type are inserted into the 
text at the insertion pointer location. You can press Delete or Backspace to 
demolish text, and you can use the arrow keys to move the insertion pointer 
around in the text object. If you press Enter, a new line of text begins within 
the text object.
When a text object contains no text, a placeholder message appears in the 
object. For example, a title text object displays the message Click to add 
title. Other placeholders display similar messages. The placeholder mes-
sage magically vanishes when you click the object and begin typing text.
 
If you start typing without clicking anywhere, the text that you type is entered 
into the title text object — assuming that the title text object doesn’t already 
have text of its own. If the title object is not empty, any text that you type 
(with no text object selected) is simply ignored.
After you finish typing text, press Esc or click anywhere outside the text 
object.

23
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
In Chapter 2, you find many details about playing with text objects, but hold 
your horses. You have more important things to attend to first.
Adding a new slide
When you first create a presentation, it has just one slide, which is useful only 
for the shortest presentations. Fortunately, PowerPoint gives you about 50 
ways to add new slides to your presentation. You see only three of them here:
 
✓ On the Home tab, click the New Slide button in the Slides group, as 
shown in Figure 1-5.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+M.
 
✓ Right-click in the Slides or Outline tab on the left and then choose New 
Slide.
In all three cases, PowerPoint adds a blank slide with a standard layout that 
includes a title and content area as shown in Figure 1-5. If you want to choose 
a different layout, click the Layout button in the Home tab to display the gal-
lery of slide layouts. This pane enables you to pick from several types of slide 
layouts. Just click the one that you want to use, and PowerPoint sets the new 
slide to the layout of your choosing.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Choosing a 
slide layout.
 

24
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Each slide layout has a name. For example, the Title and Content layout 
includes a text object in addition to the title area. This is probably the layout 
you’ll use most. It’s the best format for presenting a topic along with several 
supporting points. For example, Figure 1-6 shows a typical bulleted list slide.
Moving from slide to slide
You have several ways to move forward and backward through your presen-
tation, from slide to slide:
 
✓ Click one of the double-headed arrows at the bottom of the vertical 
scroll bar. Doing so moves you through the presentation one slide at a 
time.
 
✓ Press the Page Up and Page Down keys. Using these keys also moves 
one slide at a time.
 
✓ Use the scroll bar. When you drag the box in the scroll bar, a tooltip 
appears to display the number and title of the current slide. Dragging 
the scroll bar is the quickest way to move directly to any slide in your 
presentation.
 
✓ In the list of slides on the left side of the window, click the thumbnail 
for the slide that you want to display. If the thumbnails are not visible, 
click the Slides tab above the outline.
Choosing a design
In Parts II and III of this book, you discover many different ways to create 
great-looking slides. However, you don’t have to wait until then to apply 
some basic style to your presentation. I’ve already mentioned that Office 
2010 comes preloaded with a handful of professionally designed themes that 
enable you to create polished presentations with just the click of a mouse. To 
apply one of these themes, just select the Design tab on the Ribbon and then 
click the theme you want to apply in the Themes group. Figure 1-7 shows a 
presentation after a theme has been applied.
Due to space constraints, PowerPoint doesn’t display all the available themes 
on the Ribbon at the same time. But just to the right of the themes is a scroll 
bar that you can use to scroll through the themes. And the button at the 
bottom of the scroll bar brings up a gallery that displays all the themes that 
come with Office 2010.

Displaying Your Presentation
When your masterpiece is ready, you can show it on the screen. Just follow 
these steps:
 
 
1. Choose the Slide Show tab on the Ribbon and then click the From 
Beginning button in the Start Slide Show group (shown in the margin).
 
 
 There are several shortcuts to this command. You can also start the 
show by pressing F5 or by clicking the Slide Show button, located with 
the other view buttons in the lower-right corner of the screen.
 
2. Behold the first slide.
 
 The slide fills the screen. Isn’t it pretty?
 
3. Press Enter to advance to the next slide.
 
 You can keep pressing Enter to call up each slide in the presentation. If 
you don’t like the Enter key, you can use the spacebar instead.
 
 If you want to go back a slide, press Page Up.
 
4. Press Esc when you’re done.
 
 You don’t have to wait until the last slide is shown. If you find a glaring 
mistake in a slide or if you just get bored, you can press Esc at any time 
to return to PowerPoint.
For the complete lowdown on showing your presentation, kindly turn to 
Chapter 6.
Saving Your Work
Now that you’ve spent hours creating the best presentation since God gave 
Moses the Ten Commandments, it’s time to save your work to a file. If you 
make the rookie mistake of turning off your computer before you’ve saved 
your presentation, poof! Your work vanishes as if David Copperfield were in 
town.
Like everything else in PowerPoint, you have at least four ways to save a 
document:
 
✓ Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
✓ Click the File tab to switch to Backstage View and then choose Save.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+S.
 
✓ Press Shift+F12.

27
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
If you haven’t yet saved the file to your hard drive, the magical Save As dialog 
box appears. Type the name that you want to use for the file in the Save As 
dialog box and click OK to save the file. After you save the file once, subse-
quent saves update the hard drive file with any changes that you made to the 
presentation since the last time you saved it.
Also note that after you save a file for the first time, the name in the presenta-
tion window’s title area changes from Presentation to the name of your file. 
This is simply proof that the file has been saved.
 
Keep the following tips in mind when saving files:
 
✓ Put on your Thinking Cap when assigning a name to a new file. The file-
name is how you can recognize the file later on, so pick a meaningful 
name that suggests the file’s contents.
 
✓ Don’t work on your file for hours at a time without saving it. I’ve learned 
the hard way to save my work every few minutes. After all, I live in 
California, so I never know when a rolling blackout will hit my neighbor-
hood. Get into the habit of saving every few minutes, especially after 
making a significant change to a presentation, such as adding a covey 
of new slides or making a gaggle of complicated formatting changes.
 
✓ If you want to save a copy of the presentation you’re working on using 
a different filename, choose File➪Save As. Type a new name for the file 
and then click Save.
 
✓ The File➪Save As command includes a Save As Type option that lets you 
change the file format your presentation file is saved in. The most impor-
tant use of this option is to save your file as a PDF or XPS file. A PDF file 
is a widely used file format that lets any user display the contents of the 
file whether or not he or she owns a copy of the software used to create 
the file. PDF was developed and marketed by Adobe. XPS has a similar 
purpose, but was developed and marketed by Microsoft.
Opening a Presentation
After you save your presentation to your hard drive, you can retrieve it later 
when you want to make additional changes or to print it. As you might guess, 
PowerPoint gives you about 2,037 ways to accomplish the retrieval. Here are 
the three most common:
 
✓ Click the File tab to switch to Backstage View and then choose the Open 
command.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+O.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+F12.

28
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
All three retrieval methods pop up in the Open dialog box, which gives you 
a list of files to choose from. Click the file that you want and then click OK or 
press Enter.
The Open dialog box has controls that enable you to rummage through the 
various folders on your hard drive in search of your files. If you know how to 
open a file in any Windows application, you know how to do it in PowerPoint 
(because the Open dialog box is pretty much the same in any Windows 
program).
If you seem to have lost a file, rummage around in different folders to see 
whether you can find it. Perhaps you saved a file in the wrong folder by acci-
dent. Also, check the spelling of the filename. Maybe your fingers weren’t 
on the home row when you typed the filename, so instead of River City.
pptx, you saved the file as Eucwe Xurt.pptx. I hate it when that happens. 
If all else fails, you can use Windows’ built-in Search feature. For Windows 
XP, click the Start button and then choose Search and follow the instructions 
that appear in the Search Results window. If you’re using Vista or Windows 7, 
you can simply type some or all of the filename in the Instant Search box that 
appears in the Start menu.
 
The fastest way to open a file from the Open dialog box is to double-click 
the file. This spares you from having to click the file once and then click OK. 
Double-clicking also exercises the fast-twitch muscles in your index finger.
PowerPoint keeps track of the files you’ve recently opened and displays them 
on the File menu. To open a file that you recently opened, click the File tab, 
select Recent in Backstage View, and then inspect the list of files on the right 
side of the menu. If the file that you want is in the list, click it to open it.
Closing a Presentation
Having finished and saved your presentation, you have come to the time to 
close it. Closing a presentation is kind of like gathering your papers, putting 
them neatly in a file folder, and returning the folder to its proper file drawer. 
The presentation disappears from your computer screen. Don’t worry: It’s 
tucked safely away on your hard drive where you can get to it later if you 
need to.
To close a file, click the Close button that appears at the top right of the 
PowerPoint window. Alternatively, you can click the File tab and then choose 
Close, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W. But clicking the Close button is 
the easiest way to close a file.

29
 Chapter 1: Welcome to PowerPoint 2010
 
You don’t have to close a file before exiting PowerPoint. If you exit PowerPoint 
without closing a file, PowerPoint graciously closes the file for you. The only 
reason that you might want to close a file is that you want to work on a differ-
ent file and you don’t want to keep both files open at the same time.
If you’ve made changes since the last time you saved the file, PowerPoint 
offers to save the changes for you. Click Save to save the file before closing or 
click Don’t Save to abandon any changes that you’ve made to the file.
If you close all the open PowerPoint presentations, you might discover that 
most of the PowerPoint commands have been rendered useless. (They are 
grayed on the menu.) Fear not. If you open a presentation or create a new 
one, the commands return to life.
Exiting PowerPoint
Had enough excitement for one day? Use any of these techniques to shut 
down PowerPoint:
 
✓ Click the File tab to switch to Backstage View and then choose Exit from 
the menu.
 
✓ Click the X box at the top-right corner of the PowerPoint window.
 
✓ Press Alt+F4.
Bam! PowerPoint is history.
You should know a couple things about exiting PowerPoint (or any 
application):
 
✓ PowerPoint doesn’t let you abandon ship without first considering 
whether you want to save your work. If you’ve made changes to any 
presentation files and haven’t saved them, PowerPoint offers to save the 
files for you. Lean over and plant a fat kiss right in the middle of your 
monitor — PowerPoint just saved you your job.
 
✓ Never, never, never, ever, never turn off your computer while PowerPoint 
or any other program is running. Bad! Always exit PowerPoint and all 
other programs that are running before you turn off your computer.

▶ Finding and replacing text
▶ Rearranging slides
I
f you’re like Mary Poppins (“Practically Perfect in Every Way”), you can 
skip this chapter. Perfect people never make mistakes, so everything that 
they type in PowerPoint comes out right the first time. They never have to 
press Backspace to erase something they typed incorrectly, or go back and 
insert a line to make a point they left out, or rearrange their slides because 
they didn’t add them in the right order to begin with.
If you’re more like Jane (“Rather Inclined to Giggle; Doesn’t Put Things 
Away”) or Michael (“Extremely Stubborn and Suspicious”), you probably 
make mistakes along the way. This chapter shows you how to go back and 
correct those mistakes.
Reviewing your work and correcting it if necessary is called editing. It’s not a 
fun job, but it has to be done. A spoonful of sugar usually helps.
This chapter focuses mostly on editing text objects. Many of the techniques 
apply to editing other types of objects, such as clip art pictures or drawn 
shapes. For more information about editing other types of objects, see Part III.
Moving from Slide to Slide
The most common way to move in a PowerPoint presentation is to press the 
Page Down and Page Up keys:
 
✓ Page Down: Press Page Down to move forward to the next slide in your 
presentation.

32
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
✓ Page Up: Press Page Up to move backward to the preceding slide in 
your presentation.
You can also use the vertical scroll bar on the right side of the window to 
navigate through your presentation:
 
✓ Double-headed arrows: You can move forward or backward through 
your presentation one slide at a time by clicking the double-headed 
arrows at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar.
 
✓ Single-headed arrows: You can also scroll forward or backward through 
your presentation by clicking and holding the single-headed arrow at the 
top or bottom of the vertical scroll bar. (Note that if the zoom factor is 
set so that a single slide is visible in the presentation window, clicking 
the single-headed arrows moves to the next or previous slide.)
 
✓ Scroll box: Another way to move quickly from slide to slide is by drag-
ging the scroll bar up or down. When you drag the scroll bar, a little 
tooltip pops up next to it to tell you which slide will be displayed if you 
stop dragging at that point.
Working with Objects
In the beginning, the User created a slide. And the slide was formless and 
void, without meaning or content. And the User said, “Let there be a Text 
Object.” And there was a Text Object. And there was evening and there was 
morning, one day. Then the User said, “Let there be a Picture Object.” And 
there was a Picture Object. And there was evening and there was morning, 
a second day. This continued for forty days and forty nights, until there were 
forty objects on the slide, each after its own kind. And the User was laughed 
out of the auditorium by the audience who could not read the slide.
I present this charming little parable solely to make the point that 
PowerPoint slides are nothing without objects. Objects are items — such 
as text, pictures, and charts — that give meaning and content to otherwise 
formless and empty slides. When it comes to objects, however, sometimes 
less is more. Don’t overdo it by cluttering your slides with so many objects 
that the main point of the slide is obscured.
Most of the objects on your slides are text objects, which let you type text 
on your slides. For more information about working with text objects, see 
Chapter 8.
Every slide has a slide layout that consists of one or more placeholders. A 
placeholder is simply an area on a slide that’s reserved for text, clip art, a 
graph, or some other type of object. For example, a slide that uses the Title 
layout has two placeholders for text objects: one for the title and the other 
for the subtitle. You use the Slide Layout task pane to select the layout when 

33
 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
you create new slides. You can change the layout later, as well as add more 
objects to the slide. You can also delete, move, or resize objects if you want. 
For more information about slide layouts, see Chapter 1.
You can add many different types of objects, such as clip art, charts, graphs, 
shapes, and so on. You can add more objects to your slide with one of the 
tools that appears on the Drawing toolbar at the bottom of the screen or by 
using the icons that appear in the center of slides created using the Content 
layouts. For more information about adding objects to your slides, see 
Chapters 12 through 17.
Each object occupies a rectangular region on the slide. The contents of the 
object might or might not visually fill the rectangular region, but you can see 
the outline of the object when you select it. (See the next section “Selecting 
objects.”)
Objects can overlap. Usually, you don’t want them to, but sometimes doing 
so creates a jazzy effect. You may lay some text on top of some clip art, for 
example.
Selecting objects
Before you can edit anything on a slide, you have to select the object that 
contains whatever it is that you want to edit. For example, you can’t start 
typing away to edit text onscreen. Instead, you must first select the text 
object that contains the text you want to edit. Likewise, you must select 
other types of objects before you can edit their contents.
Note that you must be in Normal view to select individual objects on the 
slide. In Slide Sorter view, you can select whole slides but not the individual 
elements on them.
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when selecting objects:
 
✓ Text objects: To select a text object so that you can edit its text, move 
the insertion point over the text that you want to edit and then click. A 
rectangular box appears around the object, and a text insertion point 
appears so that you can start typing away.
 
✓ Non-text objects: Other types of objects work a little differently. Click an 
object, and the object is selected. The rectangular box appears around 
the object to let you know that you’ve hooked it. After you’ve hooked 
the object, you can drag it around the screen or change its size, but you 
can’t edit it.
 
✓ The Ctrl key: You can select more than one object by selecting the first 
object and then holding down the Ctrl key while clicking to select addi-
tional objects.

34
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
✓ Click and drag: Another way to select an object — or more than one 
object — is to use the insertion point to drag a rectangle around the 
objects that you want to select. Point to a location above and to the 
left of the object(s) that you want to select, and then click and drag the 
mouse down and to the right until the rectangle surrounds the objects. 
When you release the button, all the objects within the rectangle are 
selected.
 
✓ The Tab key: Also, you can press the Tab key to select objects. Press 
Tab once to select the first object on the slide. Press Tab again to select 
the next object. Keep pressing Tab until the object that you want is 
selected.
 
 Pressing Tab to select objects is handy when you can’t easily point 
to the object that you want to select. This problem can happen if the 
object that you want is buried underneath another object or if the object 
is empty or otherwise invisible and you’re not sure of its location.
Resizing or moving an object
When you select an object, an outline box appears around it, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. If you look closely at the box, you can see that it has love handles, 
one on each corner and one in the middle of each edge. You can use these 
love handles to adjust the size of an object. You can also grab the box edge 
between the love handles to move the object on the slide. (Technically, the 
love handles are called sizing handles.)
In addition, for many types of objects, a green dot called the rotate handle 
appears, floating above the object. You can rotate the object by grabbing 
this handle and dragging it around in a circle. (Not all types of objects can be 
rotated, however. For example, you can’t rotate charts.)
To change the size of an object, click the object to select it and then grab one 
of the love handles by clicking. Hold down the mouse button and then move 
the mouse to change the object’s size.
The various handles on an object give you different ways to change the 
object’s size:
 
✓ The handles at the corners allow you to change both the height and the 
width of the object.
 
✓ The handles on the top and bottom edges allow you to change just the 
object’s height.
 
✓ The handles on the right and left edges change just the width of the 
object.

35
 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
 
Figure 2-1: 
You can 
resize this 
object by 
taking hold 
of its love 
handles.
 
Rotate handle
Sizing handle
If you hold down the Ctrl key while you drag one of the love handles, the 
object stays centered at its current position on the slide as its size adjusts. 
Try it to see what I mean. Also, try holding down the Shift key while you drag 
an object by using one of the corner love handles. This combination main-
tains the object’s proportions when you resize it.
Changing a text object’s size doesn’t change the size of the text in the object; 
it changes only the size of the frame that contains the text. Changing the 
width of a text object is equivalent to changing margins in a word proces-
sor: It makes the text lines wider or narrower. To change the size of the text 
within a text object, you must change the font size. For more information, see 
Chapter 8.
To move an object, click anywhere on the outline box — except on a love 
handle — and then drag the object to its new locale. Note that for shapes and 
other graphic objects, you don’t have to click precisely on the outline box — 
you can click and drag anywhere within the object to move it. But for objects 
that contain text, you must click the outline box itself to drag the object to a 
new location.

36
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
The outline box can be hard to see if you have a fancy background on your 
slides. If you select an object and have trouble seeing the outline box, try 
squinting or cleaning your monitor screen. Or, in severe weather, try selecting 
the View tab on the Ribbon and then choosing one of the Color/Grayscale 
options:
 
✓ Color: Displays slides in full color
 
✓ Grayscale: Displays colors as shades of gray
 
✓ Pure Black and White: Shows the slides in black and white
Viewing the slide in Grayscale or Pure Black and White might make the love 
handles easier to spot. To switch back to full-color view, click Back to Color 
View.
Editing a Text Object
When you select a text object for editing, PowerPoint transforms into a baby 
word processor so you can edit the text. Note that PowerPoint automatically 
wraps text so that you don’t have to press Enter at the end of every line. 
Press Enter only when you want to begin a new paragraph.
Text in a PowerPoint presentation is usually formatted with a bullet character 
at the beginning of each paragraph. The default bullet character depends on 
the theme you’ve applied to the slide. But if you don’t like the bullet provided 
by the theme, you can change it to just about any shape that you can imag-
ine. The point to remember here is that the bullet character is a part of the 
paragraph format, and not a character that you have to type in your text.
Some word-processing software enables you to switch between Insert mode 
and Typeover mode by pressing the Insert key on the right side of your 
keyboard. In Insert mode, any characters that you type are inserted at the 
insertion point (the blinking vertical line that appears within the text). In 
Typeover mode, each character that you type replaces the character at the 
insertion point. However, PowerPoint always works in Insert mode, so any 
text that you type is inserted at the insertion point. Pressing Insert has no 
effect on the way text is typed.
You can move around within a text object by pressing the arrow keys or by 
using the mouse. You can also use the End and Home keys to take the inser-
tion point to the start or end of the line that you’re on. Additionally, you can 
use the arrow keys in combination with the Ctrl key to move around even 
faster. For example, press the Ctrl key and the left- or right-arrow key to 
move left or right an entire word at a time.

 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
You delete text by pressing the Delete or Backspace key. To delete from the 
insertion point to the start or end of a word, use the Ctrl key along with the 
Delete or Backspace key. If you first select a block of text, the Delete and 
Backspace keys delete the entire selection. (The next section, “Selecting 
Text,” has some tips for selecting text.)
Selecting Text
Some text-editing operations — such as amputations and transplants — 
require that you first select the text on which you want to operate. The fol-
lowing list shows you the methods for selecting blocks of text:
 
✓ When you use the keyboard, hold down the Shift key while you press 
any of the arrow keys to move the insertion point.
 
✓ When you use the mouse, point to the beginning of the text that you 
want to mark and then click and drag over the text. Release the mouse 
button when you reach the end of the text that you want to select.
PowerPoint has an automatic word-selection option that tries to guess when 
you intend to select an entire word. If you use the mouse to select a block of 
text that spans the space between two words, you notice that the selected 
text jumps to include entire words while you move the mouse. If you don’t 
like this feature, you can disable it by clicking the File tab and Options button 
in Backstage View. Then deselect the When Selecting, Automatically Select 
Entire Word check box.
You can use the following tricks to select different amounts of text:
 
✓ A single word: To select a single word, point the insertion point any-
where in the word and double-click.
 
✓ An entire paragraph: To select an entire paragraph, point the insertion 
point anywhere in the paragraph and triple-click.
After you have selected text, you can edit it in the following ways:
 
✓ Delete text: To delete the entire block of text that you’ve selected, press 
Delete or Backspace.
 
✓ Replace text: To replace an entire block of text, select it and then begin 
typing. The selected block vanishes and is replaced by the text that 
you’re typing.
 
✓ Cut, Copy, and Paste: You can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands 
from the Clipboard group with selected text blocks. The following sec-
tion describes these commands.

38
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Using Cut, Copy, and Paste
Like any good Windows program, PowerPoint uses the standard Cut, Copy, 
and Paste commands. These commands work on text that you’ve selected, or 
if you’ve selected an entire object, the commands work on the object itself. 
In other words, you can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands with bits of 
text or with entire objects.
Cut, Copy, and Paste all work with one of the greatest mysteries of Windows — 
the Clipboard. The Clipboard is where Windows stashes stuff so that you can 
get to it later. The Cut and Copy commands add stuff to the Clipboard, and the 
Paste command copies stuff from the Clipboard to your presentation.
For basic cutting, copying, and pasting, you can use the standard Windows 
keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+X for Cut, Ctrl+C for Copy, and Ctrl+V for Paste. 
Because these three keyboard shortcuts work in virtually all Windows pro-
grams, memorizing them pays off.
The Ribbon buttons for working with the Clipboard are found in the 
Clipboard group of the Home tab. Three of the four buttons in this section 
are for working with the Clipboard:
 
 
Cut
 
 
Copy
 
 
Paste
Notice that the Copy button includes a drop-down arrow. If you click the 
Copy icon itself, the selected object is copied to the Clipboard. But if you 
click the drop-down arrow instead, a small menu with two icons is displayed. 
The first copies the selection; the second makes a duplicate. For more 
information about creating duplicates, see the next section, “Duplicating an 
Object.”
A new feature in PowerPoint 2010 lets you preview how the contents of the 
Clipboard will appear before you actually paste it into your slide. To use this 
feature, copy or cut something to the Clipboard. Then, click the down arrow 
beneath the Paste button. This reveals a menu with several buttons repre-
senting different ways to paste the selection. Hover the mouse over each icon 

39
 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
to see a preview of how the item will appear when pasted. When you find a 
button whose paste preview you approve of, click the button to paste the 
item.
If you want to blow away an entire object permanently, select it and then 
press Delete or Backspace. This step removes the object from the slide but 
doesn’t copy it to the Clipboard. It’s gone forever. Well, sort of — you can 
still get it back by using the Undo command, but only if you act fast. See the 
section, “Oops! I Didn’t Mean It (The Marvelous Undo Command)” for more 
information.
 
To include the same object on each of your slides, you can use a better 
method than copying and pasting: Add the object to the Slide Master, which 
governs the format of all the slides in a presentation. (See Chapter 11.)
Duplicating an Object
PowerPoint has a Duplicate command you can use to quickly create copies 
of objects. First, select the object you want to duplicate. Then, press Ctrl+D 
to create a duplicate of the object. You probably need to move the duplicate 
object to its correct location.
An even easier way to duplicate an object is to hold down the Ctrl key, click, 
and then drag the object to a new location on the slide. After you release the 
mouse button, a duplicate copy of the object is created.
Using the Clipboard Task Pane
The Clipboard task pane lets you gather up to 24 items of text or graphics 
from any Office program and then selectively paste them into your presen-
tation. To summon the Clipboard task pane, click the dialog box launcher 
in the Home tab on the Ribbon at the bottom right of the Clipboard group. 
Then, the Clipboard task pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-2. Here you can 
see the Clipboard task pane at the left side of the PowerPoint window, with 
several objects held in the Clipboard.
To paste an item from the Clipboard task pane, simply click the item you 
want to insert.

Oops! I Didn’t Mean It (The 
Marvelous Undo Command)
Made a mistake? Don’t panic. Use the Undo command. Undo is your safety 
net. If you mess up, Undo can save the day.
You have two ways to undo a mistake:
 
✓ Click the Undo button in the Quick Access toolbar.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Z.
Undo reverses whatever you did last. If you deleted text, Undo adds it back. 
If you typed text, Undo deletes it. If you moved an object, Undo puts it back 
where it was. You get the idea.
Undo is such a useful command that committing the Ctrl+Z keyboard short-
cut to memory is a good idea. If you want, think of the word Zip! to help you 
remember how to zip away your mistakes.

41
 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
 
 Undo remembers up to 20 of your most recent actions. You can undo each 
action one at a time by repeatedly using the Undo command. Or you can click 
the down arrow next to the Undo button (shown in the margin) on the Quick 
Access toolbar and then choose the actions you want to undo from the list 
that appears. However, as a general rule, you should correct your mistakes 
as soon as possible. If you make a mistake, feel free to curse, kick something, 
or fall on the floor in a screaming tantrum if you must, but don’t do anything 
else on your computer! If you use the Undo command immediately, you can 
reverse your mistake and get on with your life.
 
 PowerPoint also offers a Redo command (shown in the margin), which is sort 
of like an Undo for Undo. In other words, if you undo what you thought was a 
mistake by using the Undo command and then decide that it wasn’t a mistake 
after all, you can use the Redo command. Here are two ways to use the Redo 
command:
 
✓ Click the Redo button on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Y.
Note that if the last action you performed wasn’t an Undo command, the 
Redo button is replaced by a Repeat button. You can click the Repeat button 
to repeat the last command.
Deleting a Slide
Want to delete an entire slide? No problem. Simply move to the slide that you 
want to delete and click the Delete button in the Slides group of the Home tab 
on the Ribbon. Zowie! The slide is history.
Another way to delete a slide is to click the miniature of the slide in the Slide 
Preview pane (on the left side of the screen) and then press the Delete key or 
the Backspace key.
Deleted the wrong slide, eh? No problem. Just press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo 
button to restore the slide.
Duplicating a Slide
PowerPoint sports a Duplicate Slide command that lets you duplicate an 
entire slide — text, formatting, and everything else included. That way, after 
you toil over a slide for hours to get its formatting just right, you can create a 
duplicate to use as the basis for another slide.

42
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
To duplicate a slide — or slides — select the slide(s) you want to duplicate. 
Then open the Home tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow at the bottom of 
the Add Slide button in the Slides group, and choose the Duplicate Selected 
Slides button. A duplicate of the slide is inserted into your presentation.
If you’re a keyboard shortcut fanatic, all you have to do is select the slide 
that you want to duplicate in the Slides pane (located on the left side of the 
screen) and then press Ctrl+D.
Finding Text
You know that buried somewhere in that 60-slide presentation is a slide that 
lists the options available on the Vertical Snarfblat, but where is it? This 
sounds like a job for the PowerPoint Find command!
The Find command can find text buried in any text object on any slide. These 
steps show you the procedure for using the Find command:
 
1. Think of what you want to find.
 
 Snarfblat will suffice for this example.
 
 
2. Click the Find button in the Editing group of the Home tab (as shown 
in the margin) or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F.
 
 The Find dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-3, which contains the 
secrets of the Find command.
 
Figure 2-3: 
The Find 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Type the text that you want to find.
 
 It displays in the Find What box.
 
4. Press Enter.
 
 Or click the Find Next button. Either way, the search begins.
If the text that you type is located anywhere in the presentation, the Find 
command zips you to the slide that contains the text and highlights the text. 
You can then edit the text object or search for the next occurrence of the 

43
 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
text within your presentation. If you edit the text, the Find dialog box stays 
onscreen to make it easy to continue your quest.
Here are some facts to keep in mind when using the Find command:
 
✓ Find the next occurrence: To find the next occurrence of the same text, 
press Enter or click the Find Next button again.
 
✓ Edit the text: To edit the text you found, click the text object. The Find 
dialog box remains onscreen. To continue searching, click the Find Next 
button again.
 
✓ Start anywhere: You don’t have to be at the beginning of your presen-
tation to search the entire presentation. When PowerPoint reaches 
the end of the presentation, it automatically picks up the search at the 
beginning and continues to the point at which you started the search.
 
✓ Give up: You might receive the following message:
PowerPoint has finished searching the presentation. 
The search item wasn’t found.
 
 This message means that PowerPoint has given up. The text that you’re 
looking for just isn’t anywhere in the presentation. Maybe you spelled it 
wrong, or maybe you didn’t have a slide about Snarfblats after all.
 
✓ Match case: If the right mix of uppercase and lowercase letters is impor-
tant to you, select the Match Case check box before beginning the search. 
This option is handy when you have, for example, a presentation about 
Mr. Smith the Blacksmith.
 
✓ Find whole words: Use the Find Whole Words Only check box to find 
your text only when it appears as a whole word. If you want to find the 
slide on which you discuss Smitty the Blacksmith’s mitt, for example, 
type mitt for the Find What text and select the Find Whole Words Only 
check box. That way, the Find command looks for mitt as a separate 
word. It doesn’t stop to show you the mitt in Smitty.
 
✓ Replace text: If you find the text that you’re looking for and decide that 
you want to replace it with something else, click the Replace button. 
This step changes the Find dialog box to the Replace dialog box, which 
is explained in the following section.
 
✓ Close the Find dialog box: To make the Find dialog box go away, click 
the Close button or press Esc.
Replacing Text
Suppose that the Rent-a-Nerd company decides to switch to athletic consult-
ing, so it wants to change the name of its company to Rent-a-Jock. Easy. Just 

44
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
use the handy Replace command to change all occurrences of the word Nerd 
to Jock. The following steps show you how:
 
1. Click the Replace button (found in the Editing group on the Home tab 
on the Ribbon) or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+H.
 
 The Replace dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4, appears.
 
Figure 2-4: 
The Replace 
dialog box.
 
 
2. In the Find What box, type the text that you want to find.
 
 Enter the text that you want to replace with something else (Nerd, in 
this example).
 
3. Type the replacement text in the Replace With box.
 
 Enter the text you want to use to replace the text that you typed in the 
Find What box (Jock, in this example).
 
4. Click the Find Next button.
 
 PowerPoint finds the first occurrence of the text.
 
5. Click the Replace button to replace the text.
 
 Read the text first to make sure that it found what you’re looking for.
 
6. Repeat the Find Next and Replace sequence until you’re finished.
 
 Click Find Next to find the next occurrence, click Replace to replace it, 
and so on. Keep going until you finish.
If you’re absolutely positive that you want to replace all occurrences of your 
Find What text with the Replace With text, click the Replace All button. This 
step dispenses with the Find Next and Replace cycle. The only problem is that 
you’re bound to find at least one spot where you didn’t want the replacement 
to occur. Replacing the word mitt with glove, for example, results in Sglovey 
rather than Smitty. Don’t forget that you can also use the Find Whole Words 
Only option to find and replace text only if it appears as an entire word.
If you totally mess up your presentation by clicking Replace All, you can use 
the Undo command to restore sanity to your presentation.

 Chapter 2: Editing Slides
Rearranging Your Slides 
in Slide Sorter View
Normal View is the view that you normally work in to edit your slides, move 
things around, add text or graphics, and so on. However, Normal View has 
one serious limitation: It doesn’t give you a big picture of your presentation. 
You can see the details of only one slide at a time, and the Slide Preview pane 
lets you see snapshots of only a few slides. To see an overall view of your 
presentation, you need to work in Slide Sorter View.
You can switch to Slide Sorter View in two easy ways:
 
✓ Click the Slide Sorter button at the right side of the status bar (as shown 
in Figure 2-5).
 
✓ Select the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Slide Sorter button 
in the Presentation Views group.
The PowerPoint Slide Sorter View is shown in Figure 2-5.

46
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
The following list tells you how to rearrange, add, or delete slides from Slide 
Sorter View:
 
✓ Move a slide: To move a slide, click and drag it to a new location. Point 
to the slide and then hold down the mouse button. Drag the slide to its 
new location and release the button. PowerPoint adjusts the display to 
show the new arrangement of slides.
 
✓ Delete a slide: To delete a slide, click the slide to select it and then 
press Delete or Backspace. This works only in Slide Sorter View.
 
✓ Add a new slide: To add a new slide, click the slide that you want the 
new slide to follow and then click the New Slide button. The Slide Layout 
task pane appears so that you can select the layout for the new slide. To 
edit the contents of the slide, return to Normal View via the view but-
tons (shown in Figure 2-5) or the View tab on the Ribbon or by double-
clicking the new slide.
 
If your presentation contains more slides than can fit onscreen at one time, 
you can use the scroll bars to scroll through the display. Or you can use 
the zoom slider at the bottom-right corner of the screen to make the slides 
smaller.
Slide Sorter View might seem kind of dull and boring, but it’s also the place 
where you can add jazzy transitions, build effects, or add cool animation 
effects to your slides. For example, you can make your bullets fall from the 
top of the screen like bombs and switch from slide to slide by using strips, 
wipes, or blinds. Chapter 10 describes all this cool stuff.

Chapter 3
Working in Outline View
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the outline
▶ Focusing on substance instead of form
▶ Promoting, demoting, and the lateral arabesque
▶ Adding a slide in the Outline tab
▶ Collapsing and expanding the outline
M
ost presentations consist of slide after slide of bulleted lists. You 
might see a chart here or there and an occasional bit of clip art 
thrown in for comic effect, but the bread and butter of presentations is the 
bulleted list. It sounds boring, but it’s often the best way to make sure that 
your message gets through.
For this reason, presentations lend themselves especially well to outlining. 
Good presentations are light on prose but heavy in the point and subpoint 
departments — and that’s precisely where outlines excel. The Outline tab 
that appears to the left of your slides in Normal View lets you focus on your 
presentation’s main points and subpoints. In other words, it enables you to 
focus on content without worrying about appearance.
Calling Up the Outline
On the left side of the PowerPoint window is a pair of tabs — Slides and 
Outline. Normally, the Slides tab is active, showing you thumbnail images of 
your slides. To work with the presentation in Outline mode, click the Outline 
tab. Then, your presentation appears as an outline, with the title of each slide 
as a separate heading at the highest level of the outline, and the text on each 
slide appears as lower-level headings subordinate to the slide headings. See 
Figure 3-1. (Note that if a slide doesn’t have a title, the slide still appears in 
the outline, but the top-level heading for the slide is blank.)
 
You can expand the area devoted to the outline by clicking and dragging the 
border of the Outline pane.

48
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
Figure 3-1: 
Viewing the 
outline.
 
The following list highlights a few important things to notice about the 
outline:
 
✓ The outline is comprised of the titles and body text of each slide. Any 
other objects that you add to a slide — such as pictures, charts, and so 
on — are not included in the outline. Also, if you add any text objects to 
the slide in addition to the basic title and body text placeholders in the 
slide layout, the additional text objects are not included in the outline.
 
✓ Each slide is represented by a high-level heading in the outline. The 
text of this heading is taken from the slide’s title, and an icon that rep-
resents the entire slide appears next to the heading. Also, the slide 
number appears to the left of the Slide icon.
 
✓ Each text line from a slide’s body text appears as an indented head-
ing. This heading is subordinate to the slide’s main title heading.
 
✓ An outline can contain subpoints that are subordinate to the main 
points on each slide. PowerPoint enables you to create as many as 
nine heading levels on each slide, but your slides will probably get too 
complicated if you go beyond two headings. You can find more about 
working with heading levels in the section “Promoting and Demoting 
Paragraphs,” later in this chapter.

49
 Chapter 3: Working in Outline View
Selecting and Editing an Entire Slide
When you work with the Outline tab, you often have to select an entire slide. 
You can do that by clicking the icon for the slide. This selects the slide title 
and all its body text. In addition, any extra objects, such as graphics, that are 
on the slide are also selected even though those objects don’t appear in the 
outline.
You can delete, cut, copy, or duplicate an entire slide:
 
✓ Delete: To delete an entire slide, select it and then press Delete.
 
✓ Cut or copy: To cut or copy an entire slide to the Clipboard, select the 
slide and then press Ctrl+X (Cut) or Ctrl+C (Copy), or use the Cut or 
Copy button on the Home tab on the Ribbon. You can then move the 
cursor to any location in the outline and press Ctrl+V or use the Paste 
button to paste the slide from the Clipboard. (You can also cut or copy a 
slide by right-clicking the slide and choosing Cut or Copy from the menu 
that appears.)
 
✓ Duplicate: To duplicate a slide, select it and then press Ctrl+D. This step 
places a copy of the selected slide immediately after it. (Actually, you 
don’t have to select the entire slide to duplicate it. Just click anywhere 
in the slide’s title or body text.)
Selecting and Editing One Paragraph
You can select and edit an entire paragraph along with all its subordinate 
paragraphs. To do so, just click the bullet next to the paragraph that you 
want to select. To delete an entire paragraph along with its subordinate para-
graphs, select it and then press Delete.
To cut or copy an entire paragraph to the Clipboard along with its subordi-
nates, select it and then press Ctrl+X (Cut) or Ctrl+C (Copy). You can then 
press Ctrl+V to paste the paragraph anywhere in the presentation.
Promoting and Demoting Paragraphs
To promote a paragraph is to move it up one level in the outline. If you pro-
mote the “Memorizing jokes from Captain Billy’s Whiz Bang” paragraph in 
Figure 3-1, for example, that paragraph becomes a separate slide rather than 
a bullet paragraph under “Signs of Trouble.”

50
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
To promote a paragraph, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and 
then press Shift+Tab or click the Decrease List Level button in the Paragraph 
group on the Home tab.
To demote a paragraph is to do just the opposite: The paragraph moves 
down one level in the outline. If you demote the “Dime novels hidden in the 
corn crib” paragraph in Figure 3-1, it becomes a subpoint under “Rebuckling 
of knickerbockers below the knee” rather than a separate main point.
To demote a paragraph, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and 
then either press the Tab key or click the Increase List Level button in the 
Paragraph group on the Home tab.
Note that you can’t promote a slide title. Slide title is the highest rank in the 
outline hierarchy. If you demote a slide title, the entire slide is subsumed into 
the preceding slide. In other words, the slide title becomes a main point in 
the preceding slide.
You can promote or demote paragraphs by using the mouse, but the tech-
nique is a little tricky. When you move the cursor over a bullet (or the Slide 
button), the pointer changes from a single arrow to a four-cornered arrow. 
This arrow is your signal that you can click to select the entire paragraph 
(and any subordinate paragraphs). Then, you can use the mouse to pro-
mote or demote a paragraph along with all its subordinates by dragging the 
selected paragraph left or right.
Be sensitive when you demote paragraphs. Being demoted can be an emo-
tionally devastating experience.
Adding a New Paragraph
To add a new paragraph to a slide with the outline that appears on the 
Outline tab, move the insertion point to the end of the paragraph that you 
want the new paragraph to follow and then press Enter. PowerPoint creates a 
new paragraph at the same outline level as the preceding paragraph.
Note that if you move the insertion point to the end of the title line and press 
Enter, PowerPoint creates a new slide. However, you can then press the Tab 
key to change the new slide to a paragraph on the previous slide.
If you position the insertion point at the beginning of a paragraph and press 
Enter, the new paragraph is inserted above the cursor position. If you posi-
tion the cursor in the middle of a paragraph and press Enter, the paragraph 
is split in two.

51
 Chapter 3: Working in Outline View
After you add a new paragraph, you might want to change its level in the 
outline. To do that, you must promote or demote the new paragraph (as 
described in the preceding section). To create a subpoint for a main point, 
for example, position the cursor at the end of the main point and press Enter. 
Then, demote the new paragraph by pressing the Tab key.
Adding a New Slide
You can add a new slide in many ways when you’re working with the outline. 
This list shows the most popular methods:
 
✓ Promote existing text: Promote an existing paragraph to the highest 
level. This method splits a slide into two slides.
 
✓ Promote new text: Add a new paragraph and then promote it to the 
highest level.
 
✓ Press Enter: Place the cursor in a slide’s title text and press Enter. This 
method creates a new slide before the current slide. Whether the title 
text stays with the current slide, goes with the new slide, or is split 
between the slides depends on the location of the cursor within the title 
when you press Enter.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Enter: Place the cursor anywhere in a slide’s body text and 
press Ctrl+Enter. This method creates a new slide immediately follow-
ing the current slide. The position of the cursor within the existing 
slide doesn’t matter; the new slide is always created after the current 
slide. (The cursor must be in the slide’s body text, however, in order 
for this method to work. If you put the cursor in a slide title and press 
Ctrl+Enter, the cursor jumps to the slide’s body text without creating a 
new slide.)
 
✓ Insert a new slide: Place the cursor anywhere in the slide and use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+M or click the Add Slide button in the Slides 
group of the Home Ribbon tab.
 
✓ Duplicate an existing slide: Select an existing slide by clicking the slide’s 
icon or triple-clicking the title, and then press Ctrl+D to duplicate it.
 
Because the outline focuses on slide content rather than on layout, new slides 
receive the basic Title and Content layout, which includes title text and body 
text formatted with bullets.

52
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Moving Text Up and Down
The outline is a handy way to rearrange your presentation. You can easily 
change the order of individual points on a slide, or you can rearrange the 
order of the slides.
You can rearrange your presentation by right-clicking the paragraphs that 
you want to move and then clicking the Move Up or Move Down button in 
the menu that appears. Or you can point to the bullet next to the paragraph 
that you want to move. Then, when the cursor changes to the four-cornered 
arrow, click and drag the paragraph up or down. A horizontal line appears, 
showing the horizontal position of the selection. Release the mouse button 
when the horizontal line is positioned where you want the text.
 
Be careful when you’re moving text in a slide that has more than one level of 
body text paragraphs. Notice the position of the horizontal line when you drag 
the selection; the entire selection is inserted at that location, which might split 
up subpoints. If you don’t like the result of a move, you can always undo it by 
pressing Ctrl+Z or clicking the Undo button.
Collapsing and Expanding the Outline
If your presentation has many slides, you might find that grasping its overall 
structure is difficult, even when looking at the outline. Fortunately, PowerPoint 
enables you to collapse the outline so that only the slide titles are shown. 
Collapsing an outline doesn’t delete the body text; it merely hides the body 
text so that you can focus on the order of the slides in your presentation.
Expanding a presentation restores the collapsed body text to the outline so 
that you can once again focus on details. You can collapse and expand an 
entire presentation, or you can collapse and expand one slide at a time.
To collapse the entire presentation, right-click anywhere in the outline and 
then choose Collapse➪Collapse All or use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Shift+1. 
To expand the presentation, right-click and choose Expand➪Expand All or 
press Alt+Shift+9.
To collapse a single slide, right-click anywhere in the slide and then choose 
Collapse➪Collapse from the menu that appears. To expand a single slide, 
right-click the collapsed slide and choose Expand➪Expand.

qualifies me to run for president or anything, but it shows how much I 
appreciate computer spell checkers. Spelling makes no sense to me. I felt a 
little better after watching The Story of English on public television. Now at

Fortunately, PowerPoint 2010 has a pretty decent spell checker. In fact, the 
spell checker in PowerPoint is so smart that it knows that you’ve made a 
spelling mistake almost before you make it. The spell checker watches over 
your shoulder as you type and helps you to correct your spelling errors as 
you work.
Checking Spelling As You Go
Spelling errors in a word-processing document are bad, but at least they’re 
small. In a PowerPoint presentation, spelling errors are small only until 
you use a projector to throw your presentation onto a 30-foot screen. Then 
they get all blown out of proportion. Nothing is more embarrassing than a 
3-foot-tall spelling error. And if you’re like me, you probably try to look for 
mistakes in other people’s presentations just for kicks. Thank goodness for 
PowerPoint’s on-the-fly spell checker.
The PowerPoint spell checker doesn’t make you wait until you finish your 
presentation and run a special command to point out your spelling errors. 
It boldly points out your mistakes right when you make them by underlining 
any word it doesn’t recognize with a wavy red line, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
Figure 4-1: 
PowerPoint 
usually 
knows 
before you 
do that 
you’ve 
misspelled 
a word.
 
In Figure 4-1, two words have been marked as misspelled: snickerbockers 
(isn’t that a kind of cookie?), and Memorizating. When you see the telltale 
wavy red line, you have several options:
 
✓ Make the correction: You can retype the word using the correct spelling.
 
✓ Let PowerPoint help: You can right-click the word to call up a menu 
that lists suggested spellings for the word. In most cases, PowerPoint 
can figure out what you meant to type and suggests the correct spelling. 
To replace the misspelled word with the correct spelling, just click the 
correctly spelled word in the menu.
 
✓ Ignore the misspelling: Sometimes, you want to misspell a word on 
purpose (for example, if you run a restaurant named “The Koffee Kup”). 
More likely, the word is correctly spelled, but PowerPoint just doesn’t 
know about the word. The right-click menu will help in either case: You 
can right-click the word in question and then choose either Ignore All 
to ignore the misspelling or Add to Dictionary to add it to PowerPoint’s 
spelling dictionary.
 
The spell checker can’t tell you when you’ve used the wrong word but spelled 
it correctly. For example, the second bullet point in Figure 4-1 mentions dime 
navels instead of dime novels. Cheap literature might be a bad thing, but cheap 
citrus certainly is not.

 Chapter 4: Proofing Your Presentations
Spell Checking After-the-Fact
If you prefer to ignore the constant nagging by PowerPoint about your spell-
ing, you can always check your spelling the old-fashioned way: by running 
the spell checker after you finish your document. The spell checker works its 
way through your entire presentation, looking up every word in its massive 
list of correctly spelled words and bringing any misspelled words to your 
attention. It performs this task without giggling or snickering. As an added 
bonus, the spell checker even gives you the opportunity to tell it that you’re 
right and it’s wrong and that it should discern how to spell words the way 
you do.
The following steps show you how to check the spelling for an entire 
presentation:
 
1. If the presentation that you want to spell check is not already open, 
open it.
 
 
2. Open the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Spelling button 
found in the Proofing group (shown in the margin).
 
 
3. Tap your fingers on your desk.
 
 PowerPoint is searching your presentation for embarrassing spelling 
errors. Be patient.
 
4. Don’t be startled if PowerPoint finds a spelling error.
 
 If PowerPoint finds a spelling error in your presentation, it switches to 
the slide that contains the error, highlights the offensive word, and dis-
plays the misspelled word along with a suggested correction, as shown 
in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
The 
PowerPoint 
spell 
checker 
points out a 
boo-boo.
 
 
5. Choose the correct spelling and click the Change button. 
Alternatively, click Ignore and laugh in PowerPoint’s face.
 
 If you agree that the word is misspelled, scan the list of corrections 
that PowerPoint offers and select the one that you like. Then click the 
Change button.

56
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
 If you like the way that you spelled the word in the first place (maybe 
it’s an unusual word that isn’t in the PowerPoint spelling dictionary, or 
maybe you like to spell the way Chaucer did), click the Ignore button. 
Watch as PowerPoint turns red in the face.
 
 If you want PowerPoint to ignore all occurrences of a particular misspell-
ing within the current presentation, click the Ignore All button. Likewise, 
if you want PowerPoint to correct all occurrences of a particular mis-
spelling, click the Change All button.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until PowerPoint gives up.
 
 When you see the following message, you’re finished:
The spelling check is complete.
PowerPoint always checks spelling in the entire presentation, beginning with 
the first slide — unless you specify a single word or group of words by high-
lighting them first. PowerPoint checks the spelling of titles, body text, notes, 
and text objects added to slides. It doesn’t check the spelling in embedded 
objects, however, such as charts or graphs.
 
If PowerPoint can’t come up with a suggestion or if none of its suggestions are 
correct, you can type your own correction and click the Change button. If the 
word that you type isn’t in the dictionary, PowerPoint asks whether you’re 
sure that you know what you’re doing. Double-check and click OK if you really 
mean it.
If you get tired of PowerPoint always complaining about a word that’s not in its 
standard dictionary, click Add to add the word to the custom dictionary. If you 
can’t sleep at night until you know more about the custom dictionary, read the 
following sidebar titled “Don’t make me tell you about the custom dictionary.”
 
Ordinarily, the speller can’t tell the difference between your and you’re, ours 
and hours, angel and angle, and so on. In other words, if the word is in the dic-
tionary, PowerPoint passes it by regardless of whether you used the word cor-
rectly. Consequently, the PowerPoint spell checker is no substitute for good, 
old-fashioned proofreading. Print your presentation, sit down with a cup of 
cappuccino, and read it.
PowerPoint does, however, have a feature called contextual spelling that 
can detect some of these types of spelling errors. This feature is turned off 
by default, but you can activate it by choosing File➪Options, clicking the 
Proofing tab, and selecting the Use Contextual Spelling option. Contextual 
spelling will catch errors such as “Put you’re boots on because your going 
out in the rain,” marking both you’re and your as misspelled and suggesting 
the correct alternative. But it won’t catch an error such as “In a few ours we 
can go home.” So even when contextual spelling is on, you still must manu-
ally proof your presentations.

57
 Chapter 4: Proofing Your Presentations
Using the Thesaurus
PowerPoint includes a built-in thesaurus that can quickly show you syn-
onyms for a word that you’ve typed. Using it is easy:
 
1. Right-click a word that you’ve typed and choose Synonyms from the 
menu that appears.
 
 A menu listing synonyms for the word appears. (Sometimes PowerPoint 
throws an antonym into the list just to be contrary.)
 
2. Select the word that you want to use to replace your word.
 
 PowerPoint replaces the original word with your selection.
 
 If you choose Thesaurus from the Synonyms menu (shown in the margin), 
the Thesaurus section of the Research task pane appears with the synonyms 
listed, as shown in Figure 4-3. The Thesaurus lets you look up words to find 
even more synonyms. For example, if you select falloff from the list of syn-
onyms, you get another set of words. You can keep clicking words to find 
other synonyms as long as you’d like, until you’re ready to get back to real 
work.
Don’t make me tell you about 
the custom dictionar y
The PowerPoint spell checker can use more 
than one spelling dictionary. Besides the 
standard dictionary, which contains untold 
thousands of words that were all reviewed for 
correctness by Noah Webster himself (just kid-
ding), you can have one or more custom dic-
tionaries, which contain words that you have 
added by clicking the Add button when the spell 
checker found a spelling error.
Custom dictionaries are shared by other 
Microsoft programs that use spell checkers — 
most notably Microsoft Word. So if you add 
a word to a custom dictionary in Word, the 
PowerPoint spell checker knows about the 
word, too.
What if you accidentally add a word to the dic-
tionary? Then you have a serious problem. You 
have two alternatives. You can petition Noah 
Webster to have your variant spelling officially 
added to the English language, or you can edit 
the Custom.dic file, search through the file 
until you find the bogus word, and then delete it. 
The easiest way to edit the Custom.dic file 
is to click the File tab, and then in Backstage 
View, click Options, click Proofing, and then 
click the Custom Dictionaries button. You can 
then select the Custom.dic file and click 
Edit Word List to edit its contents.

Capitalizing Correctly
The PowerPoint Change Case command enables you to capitalize the text in 
your slides properly. These steps show you how to use it:
 
1. Select the text that you want to capitalize.
 
 
2. Choose the Home tab on the Ribbon and then click the Change Case 
button in the Font section (shown in the margin).
 
 This reveals a menu of Change Case choices.
 
3. Study the options for a moment and then click the one that you want.
 
 Here are the case options:
 
• Sentence case: The first letter of the first word in each sentence is 
capitalized. Everything else is changed to lowercase.
 
• lowercase: Everything is changed to lowercase.
 
• UPPERCASE: Everything is changed to capital letters.
 
• Capitalize Each Word: The first letter of each word is capitalized.

59
 Chapter 4: Proofing Your Presentations
 
• tOGGLE cASE: This option turns uppercase into lowercase and 
turns lowercase into uppercase, for a ransom-note look.
 
4. Check the results.
 
Always double-check your text after using the Change Case command to make 
sure that the result is what you intended. This is especially true when you 
select Capitalize Each Word. In most cases, you should not capitalize articles 
(like a and the) and prepositions (like of and from). The Capitalize Each Word 
option capitalizes every word in the title, so you’ll have to manually change 
articles and prepositions back to lowercase.
Slide titles should almost always use title case. The first level of bullets on 
a slide can use title case, where all words except articles like a or the and 
prepositions like for and to are capitalized, or sentence case, where only the 
first word of each sentence is capitalized. Lower levels usually should use 
sentence case.
 
Avoid uppercase if you can. It’s hard to read and LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE 
SHOUTING.
Using the AutoCorrect Feature
PowerPoint includes an AutoCorrect feature that can automatically correct 
spelling errors and style errors as you type them. For example, if you acci-
dentally type teh, PowerPoint automatically changes your text to the. And 
if you forget to capitalize the first word of a sentence, PowerPoint automati-
cally capitalizes it for you. AutoCorrect can even catch certain multi-word 
mistakes. For example, if you type their are, AutoCorrect will substitute 
there are.
 
Any time PowerPoint makes a correction that you don’t like, just press Ctrl+Z 
to undo the correction. For example, if you really intended to type teh, press 
Ctrl+Z immediately after PowerPoint corrects it to the.
If you move the insertion pointer back to a word that has been corrected (or 
if you click the word), a small blue line appears beneath the first letter of the 
word. Point the mouse at this blue line, and the button with a lightning bolt 
in it appears. You can then click this button to bring up a menu that enables 
you to undo the correction that was made, tell PowerPoint to stop making 
that type of correction, or summon the AutoCorrect options dialog box to 
adjust your AutoCorrect settings.

60
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
To control PowerPoint’s AutoCorrect feature, click the File tab to switch 
to Backstage View and then click Options. This summons the PowerPoint 
Options dialog box. Next, choose the Proofing tab on the left side of the 
PowerPoint Options dialog box, and then click the AutoCorrect Options 
button to display the dialog box shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
The 
AutoCorrect 
Options 
dialog box.
 
As you can see, the AutoCorrect Options dialog box contains check boxes for 
a variety of options that govern how AutoCorrect works:
 
✓ Show AutoCorrect Options buttons: This option displays the AutoCorrect 
button beneath words that were changed by the AutoCorrect feature, 
which allows you to undo the change or tell PowerPoint to stop making 
that particular type of correction.
 
✓ Correct TWo INitial CApitals: Looks for words with two initial capitals 
and changes the second one to lowercase. For example, if you type 
BOther, PowerPoint changes it to Bother. However, if you type three 
or more capitals in a row, PowerPoint assumes that you did it on pur-
pose, so no correction is made.
 
✓ Capitalize first letter of sentences: Automatically capitalizes the first 
word of a new sentence if you forget.
 
✓ Capitalize first letter of table cells: Automatically capitalizes the first 
word in table cells.
 
✓ Capitalize names of days: You know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
and so forth.

61
 Chapter 4: Proofing Your Presentations
 
✓ Correct accidental use of cAPS LOCK key: This is an especially cool 
feature. If PowerPoint notices that you’re capitalizing everything back-
wards, it assumes that you accidentally pressed the Caps Lock key. 
So it turns off Caps Lock and corrects the words that you capitalized 
backwards.
 
✓ Replace text as you type: This option is the heart of the AutoCorrect 
feature. It consists of a list of words that are frequently typed wrong, 
along with the replacement word. For example, teh is replaced by the, 
and adn is replaced by and. The AutoCorrect list also contains some 
shortcuts for special symbols. For example, (c) is replaced by the copy-
right symbol (©), and (tm) is replaced by the trademark symbol (™).
 
 You can add your own words to this list. In the Replace text box, type 
the word that you want PowerPoint to watch for. In the With text box, 
type the word that you want PowerPoint to substitute for the first word. 
Then click Add.
The AutoCorrect feature also includes several formatting options that can 
automatically apply formats as you type. To set these options, click the 
AutoFormat As You Type tab. The options shown in Figure 4-5 appear. These 
options let you control formatting features, such as automatically converting 
straight quotes to curly quotes, changing fractions such as 1/2 to fraction 
symbols such as 1⁄2, and so on.

Chapter 5
Don’t Forget Your Notes!
In This Chapter
▶ Creating speaker notes to get you through your presentation
▶ Adjusting the notes page to make long notes fit
▶ Adding a new slide from Notes Page View
▶ Printing your notes pages
E
ver had the fear — or maybe the actual experience — of showing a beau-
tiful slide, complete with snappy text and perhaps an exquisite chart, 
and suddenly forgetting why you included the slide in the first place? You 
stumble for words. “Well, as you can see, this is a beautiful chart, and, uh, 
this slide makes the irrefutable point that, uh, well, I’m not sure — are there 
any questions?”
Fear not! One of the slickest features in PowerPoint 2010 is its ability to 
create speaker notes to help you get through your presentation. You can 
make these notes as complete or as sketchy as you want or need. You can 
write a complete script for your presentation or just jot down a few key 
points to refresh your memory.
The best part about speaker notes is that you’re the only one who sees them. 
They don’t actually show up on your slides for all the world to see. Instead, 
notes pages are printed separately. One notes page is allocated for each slide 
in the presentation, and each notes page includes a reduced version of the 
slide so that you can keep track of which notes page belongs to which slide.
 
One great feature of PowerPoint is that, assuming your computer has the 
hardware to pull it off, you can display your slides on a computer projector 
and your notes on a separate monitor so only you can see them. For more 
information about this feature, see the section “Displaying Notes on a Separate 
Monitor,” later in this chapter.
Don’t you think that it’s about time for a short chapter? Although notes pages 
are one of the slickest features in PowerPoint, creating notes pages isn’t all 
that complicated — hence the brevity of this chapter.

64
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Understanding Notes
Notes are like an adjunct attachment to your slides. They don’t appear on the 
slides themselves but are displayed separately. Each slide in your presenta-
tion has its own page of notes.
Notes are usually hidden at the bottom of the screen in a tiny Notes pane 
that’s just large enough to display a line or two of text. To work with notes, 
you must first enlarge the Notes pane to give yourself some room to work. 
For more information, see the section “Adding Notes to a Slide,” later in this 
chapter.
PowerPoint also has a separate view designed for working with notes pages, 
called (you guessed it) Notes Page View. To call up Notes Page View, choose 
the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Notes Page button found in the 
Presentation Views group. Each notes page consists of a reduced version of 
the slide and an area for notes, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Notes Page 
View lets 
you see 
your notes.
 
Type your text in the notes area

65
 Chapter 5: Don’t Forget Your Notes!
Depending on the size of your monitor, these notes are too small to see or 
work with in Notes Page View unless you increase the zoom setting. But on 
smaller monitors, you can zoom in to see your work.
Unfortunately, no keyboard shortcut is available to switch directly to Notes 
Page View. Earlier versions of PowerPoint included a button for this along-
side the other view buttons in the lower-right corner of the screen. But for 
some mysterious reason, Microsoft decided to omit this button in recent ver-
sions of PowerPoint. So the only way to get to Notes Page View now is to use 
the Ribbon’s Notes Page button.
Adding Notes to a Slide
To add notes to a slide, as shown in Figure 5-2, follow this procedure:
 
Figure 5-2: 
A slide with 
notes.
 
Notes pane

66
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
1. In Normal View, move to the slide to which you want to add notes.
 
2. Click and drag the Notes pane border, if necessary, to bring the notes 
text into view.
 
3. Click the notes text object, where it reads Click to add notes.
 
4. Type away.
The text that you type appears in the notes area. As you create your notes, 
you can use any of the PowerPoint standard word-processing features, such 
as Cut, Copy, and Paste. Press Enter to create new paragraphs.
Figure 5-2 shows a slide with some notes typed.
Adding an Extra Notes Page for a Slide
PowerPoint doesn’t provide a way to add more than one page of notes for 
each slide. However, these steps show you a trick that accomplishes essen-
tially the same thing:
 
1. Create a duplicate slide immediately following the slide that requires 
two pages of notes.
 
 To duplicate the slide, move to the slide that you want to duplicate in 
Normal View and press Ctrl+D to duplicate the slide.
 
2. Click the Notes Page button in the Presentation Views group of the 
View tab.
 
 The notes page for the new duplicate slide appears.
 
3. Delete the slide object at the top of the duplicate notes page.
 
 To do so, click the slide object at the top of the page and press Delete.
 
4. Extend the notes area up so that it fills the page.
 
 To extend the notes area, just drag the top-center love handle of the 
notes area up.
 
5. Type the additional notes for the preceding slide on this new notes 
page.
 
 Add a heading, such as “Continued from slide 23,” at the top of the text 
to help you remember that this portion is a continuation of notes from 
the preceding slide.
 
6. Return to Normal View.
 
 Click the Normal button in the Presentation Views group of the View tab.

67
 Chapter 5: Don’t Forget Your Notes!
 
7. Open the Slide Show tab on the Ribbon and then click the Hide Slide 
button in the Set Up group.
 
 The Hide Slide button hides the slide, which means that it isn’t included 
in an onscreen slide show.
The result of this trick is that you now have two pages of notes for a single 
slide, and the second notes page doesn’t have an image of the slide on it and 
is not included in your slide show.
If you’re printing overhead transparencies, you might want to deselect the 
Print Hidden Slides check box in the Print dialog box. This way, the hidden 
slide isn’t printed. Be sure to select the check box when you print the notes 
pages, though. Otherwise, the notes page for the hidden slide isn’t printed 
either — and the reason you created the hidden slide in the first place was to 
print a notes page for it!
 
Think twice before creating a second page of notes for a slide. Do you really 
have that much to say about a single slide? Maybe the slide contains too much 
to begin with and should be split into two slides.
Adding a New Slide from 
Notes Page View
If you’re working in Notes Page view and realize that you want to create a 
new slide, you don’t have to return to Normal View. Just click the Add Slide 
button in the Slides group on the Home tab to add the new slide. Or press 
Ctrl+M.
If you want to work on the slide’s appearance or contents, however, you must 
switch back to Normal View. You can’t modify a slide’s appearance or con-
tents from Notes Page View.
Printing Notes Pages
If you don’t have a computer that can show your slides on a projector and 
your notes on a separate monitor, you can always print your notes on paper 
and then use the printed notes while you give your presentation. These steps 
show you how to print your notes:
 
1. Choose the Print command from the Office button menu.
 
 The Print dialog box appears.

68
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
2. Use the Print What list box to choose the Notes Pages option.
 
3. Make sure that the Print Hidden Slides check box is selected if you 
want to print notes pages for hidden slides.
 
 The Print Hidden Slides check box is dimmed if the presentation doesn’t 
have any hidden slides.
 
4. Click OK or press Enter.
You can find more information about printing in Chapter 6.
Displaying Notes on a Separate Monitor
Assuming you’re showing your project with a laptop computer connected to 
a projector, you can display a special view called Speaker View on the lap-
top’s monitor while the slides are displayed on the projector. As you can see 
in Figure 5-3, Speaker View shows the main slide on the left, your notes on 
the right, and thumbnails of adjacent slides on the bottom. To activate this 
view, simply select the Use Presenter View option in the Monitors group on 
the Slide Show tab.

Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Don’t worry — when you print a PowerPoint presentation, no one’s wait-
ing to ambush you with annoying one-liners like that guy who used to be on 
Saturday Night Live. All that awaits you is a handful of boring dialog boxes 
with boring check boxes. Point-point, click-click, print-print.
The fastest way to print your presentation is to click the Quick Print button, 
which appears on the Quick Access toolbar. This button does not appear on 
your Quick Access toolbar by default. To add it, click the down arrow to the 
right of the Quick Access toolbar and then click the Quick Print button.
Clicking this Quick Print button prints your presentation without further ado, 
using the current printer settings, which I explain in the remaining sections 
of this chapter. Usually, this action results in printing a single copy of all the 
slides in your presentation. But if you have altered the settings on the Print 
screen in Backstage View during the current PowerPoint session, clicking the 
Print button uses the altered settings automatically.
You’ll find more information about printing from Backstage View in the next 
section.
Printing from Backstage View
For precise control over how you want your presentation to be printed, you 
must switch to Backstage View and conjure up the Print screen, shown in 
Figure 6-1. To summon this screen, choose Office➪Print or press Ctrl+P.
 
 After you call up the Print screen, click the big Print button (shown in the 
margin) or press Enter to print all the slides in your presentation. Fiddle 
around with the settings to print a select group of slides, to print more than 
one copy, or to print handouts, speaker notes, or an outline. The following 
sections show you the treasures that lie hidden in this screen.
 
Printing can be es-el-oh-double-ewe, so don’t panic if your presentation 
doesn’t start printing right away. PowerPoint printouts tend to demand a great 
deal from the printer, so sometimes the printer has to work for a while before 
it can produce a finished page. Be patient. The Printer Wizard has every inten-
tion of granting your request.
Printing more than one copy
The Number of Copies field lets you print more than one copy of your pre-
sentation. You can click one of the arrows next to this field to increase or 
decrease the number of copies, or you can type directly in the field to set the 
number of copies.

Changing printers
If you’re lucky enough to have two or more printers at your disposal, you can 
use the Printer list to pick which printer you want to use. Each printer must 
first be successfully installed in Windows — a topic that’s beyond the reach of 
this humble book. However, you can find plenty of information about installing 
printers in the appropriate version of Andy Rathbone’s Windows For Dummies.
Printing part of a document
The Print All Slides drop-down list lets you choose how much of (or what 
part of) your presentation you want to print. When you first access the Print 
page in Backstage view, the Print All Slides option is selected so that your 
entire presentation prints. The other options in this drop-down list enable 
you to tell Word to print distinct portions of your presentation:
 
✓ Print Selection: Prints just the portion of the presentation that you 
selected before invoking the Print command. First, select the slides that 
you want to print. Then call up the Print command, click the Selection 
option, and click OK. (Note that this option is grayed out if nothing is 
selected when you call up the Print dialog box.)

72
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
✓ Print Current Slide: Prints just the current slide. Before you invoke the 
Print command, you should move to the slide that you want to print. 
Then select this option in the Print dialog box and click OK. This option 
is handy when you make a change to one slide and don’t want to reprint 
the entire presentation.
 
✓ Custom Range: Lets you type specific slide numbers you want to print.
 
✓ Custom Shows: If you set up one or more custom slide shows, you can 
use this option to select the show that you want to print. (See “Using 
Custom Shows” later in this chapter.)
But wait, there’s more! Beneath the Print All Slides drop-down list are several 
other controls:
 
✓ Full Page Slides: Lets you indicate how many slides per page you want 
to print. You can also use this same drop-down list to print notes pages 
or the outline rather than slides.
 
✓ Collated: This option tells PowerPoint to print each copy of your pre-
sentation one at a time. In other words, if your presentation consists of 
ten slides and you select three copies and select the Collate check box, 
PowerPoint first prints all ten slides of the first copy of the presentation, 
then all ten slides of the second copy, and then all ten slides of the third 
copy. If you don’t select the Collate check box, PowerPoint prints three 
copies of the first slide, followed by three copies of the second slide, fol-
lowed by three copies of the third slide, and so on.
 
✓ Color: This drop-down list lets you choose whether to print your slides 
in color, black and white, or with shades of gray.

The Print screen of Backstage View includes a Print Preview feature that lets 
you see how your pages will appear before actually printing them.
From the Print screen, you can zoom in to examine the preview more closely 
by clicking anywhere in the preview area. You can also scroll through the 
pages by using the scroll bar or the navigation arrows beneath the preview 
area.
Starting a Slide Show
The PowerPoint printing features are useful, but PowerPoint is really 
designed to create slides that are presented directly on a screen rather than 
printed out. The screen can be either your computer’s own monitor, a pro-
jector, or an external monitor such as a giant-screen Plasma or LCD display. 

73
 Chapter 6: Show Time!
Either way, this section and the sections that follow show you how to set up 
and show a presentation.
When you want to do a slide show in a one-on-one or small group setting 
without a projector, beginning the show is just a click away. To start a slide 
show immediately, click the Slide Show button located (along with the other 
View buttons) in the lower-right corner of the screen. If you have set up a 
full-screen slide show, PowerPoint fills the entire screen with the first slide of 
the slide show. To advance to the next slide, click the mouse button or press 
Enter, the down arrow, Page Down, or the spacebar.
You can also start a slide show by opening the Slide Show tab on the Ribbon 
and clicking either From Beginning or From Current Slide, depending on how 
you want to start the show. Or, if you’re in a hurry and have a good memory 
for keyboard shortcuts, just press F5.
If you’ve configured PowerPoint to display the slide show on a secondary 
monitor, the slide show runs on the secondary monitor. The primary monitor 
still displays the presentation in Normal View. If you want, you can switch to 
Notes View on the primary monitor to display your notes while the slides are 
displayed on the secondary monitor.
Setting Up a Slide Show
In most cases, the default settings for showing a presentation are adequate. 
However, in some cases you may need to change the default settings. To do 
so, first open the presentation that you want to set up and then open the 
Slide Show tab on the Ribbon and click Set Up Slide Show (found in the Set 
Up group). This action summons the Set Up Show dialog box, which is shown 
in Figure 6-2. With this dialog box, you can twiddle with the various options 
that are available for presenting slide shows.
 
Figure 6-2: 
The Set Up 
Show dialog 
box.
 

74
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
With the options on the Set Up Show dialog box, you can do the following:
 
✓ Configure the presentation: You can configure the presentation for one 
of three basic slide show types: Presented by a Speaker (Full Screen), 
Browsed by an Individual (Window), or Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen).
 
✓ Loop through slides: Select the Loop Continuously until ‘Esc’ check box 
if you want the show to run indefinitely. If you enable this setting, the 
show jumps back to the first slide after the last slide is shown, and the 
show continues to repeat until you press Esc.
 
✓ Simplify the presentation: Deselect the Show Without Narration and 
Show Without Animation options if you want to simplify the presenta-
tion by not playing narrations that you’ve recorded or animations that 
you’ve created.
 
✓ Select pen and laser pointer color: Select the color to use for the pen or 
laser pointer. (See the sections “Scribbling on Your Slides” and “Using 
the Laser Pointer,” later in this chapter, for more information about 
using the pen and the laser pointer.)
 
✓ Select slides: In the Show Slides area, select All to include all slides in the 
slide show or choose From and supply starting and ending slide numbers 
if you want to display just some of the slides in the presentation.
 
✓ Set up custom shows: Choose Custom Show if you have set up any 
custom shows within your presentation. (See the section “Using Custom 
Shows,” later in this chapter, for more information.)
 
✓ Choose to change slides manually: In the Advance Slides area, choose 
Manually to advance from slide to slide by pressing Enter, pressing the 
spacebar, or clicking. Or, if you want the show to proceed automatically, 
select the Using Timings, If Present option if it’s available.
 
✓ Select a monitor: If your computer has two monitors, select the moni-
tor to use for the slide show by using the drop-down list in the Multiple 
Monitors area.
Setting Up a Projector
If you’re going to present your show by using a computer projector and a 
laptop, you need to know how to connect the computer to your laptop as 
well as how to set up the projector, turn it on, focus it, and so on. Most of 
these details vary from one projector to the next, so you have to consult the 
manual that came with the projector or bribe someone to set up the projec-
tor for you. The following list provides a few general tips that might help:
 
✓ Connecting the projector: Most laptops have an external video port on 
the back or side, and most projectors have a video input connection. A 
standard VGA or DVI (depending on the type of connector on the PC and 
the projector) cable works to connect the computer to the projector.

75
 Chapter 6: Show Time!
 
✓ Activating the external video port: To use the laptop with a projector, 
you must first activate the external video port. Some laptops have a key 
that you can press to accomplish this; others require that you twiddle 
with the display settings to activate the external video port. If you can’t 
figure out how to make the switch, try right-clicking an empty area of 
the desktop and choose Properties from the menu that appears. This 
brings up a Properties dialog box. Click the Settings tab in this dialog 
box and then click the Advanced button and look for a setting to enable 
the external video port. (On my Toshiba laptop, this setting is located 
in the Display Device tab of the dialog box that appears when I click the 
Advanced button.)
 
 Note that in Vista or Windows 7, you can switch the computer into 
Presentation Mode by pressing the Windows key+P. This automatically 
activates the external video port for the projector.
 
✓ Resuming normal video: When your presentation is finished, be sure to 
switch your computer back to its normal video port setting before you 
disconnect the projector. It’s never a good idea to unplug a video cable 
while the video port is active. Plus, if your laptop disables its built-in dis-
play while the external port is active, you won’t be able to see anything!
 
✓ Selecting the projector’s video input: Most projectors can accept input 
from more than one source. For example, you might be able to connect 
a computer and a VCR to the projector. The projector should have some 
buttons or perhaps a menu setting that lets you select the input that is 
used to display the projected image. If you connect your computer to 
the projector and everything else seems okay but you still don’t get a 
picture, make sure that the projector is set to the correct input.
 
✓ Using the projector’s remote control: If you want to use the projector’s 
remote control to operate your presentation, you need the appropriate 
cable to connect the projector to your laptop’s mouse port or USB. The 
correct cable should come with the projector.
 
✓ Using sound: If your presentation has sound, you need to connect your 
computer’s sound outputs to a set of amplified speakers or, if you’re 
showing the presentation in a large auditorium, a PA system. The cor-
rect cable to connect to a PA system depends on the PA system, but a 
cable with a mini-stereo plug on one end and a 1⁄4-inch plug on the other 
will probably do the trick.
Keyboard and Mouse Tricks 
for Your Slide Show
During an onscreen slide show, you can use the keyboard and mouse to con-
trol your presentation. Tables 6-1 and 6-2 list the keys and clicks that you 
can use.

76
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
If the cursor is hidden, you can summon it by jiggling the mouse. Then, when 
the cursor is visible, a faint menu appears in the lower-left corner of the slide. 
You can use this menu to activate various slide show features.

Scribbling on Your Slides
If you’ve always wanted to diagram plays onscreen the way John Madden 
used to do before he retired and ruined Monday Night for all of us, try using 
the pen during a slide show:
 
1. Start a slide show.
 
2. When you want to doodle on a slide, press Ctrl+P.
 
 The arrow cursor changes to a pen shape.
 
3. Draw away.
 
 Figure 6-3 shows an example of a doodled-upon slide.
 
4. To erase your doodles, press E.
 
5. To stop drawing, press Esc.
 
 This returns the normal cursor.

78
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
Drawing doodles like this requires good mouse dexterity. With practice, you 
can create all kinds of interesting doodles. Work on circling text or drawing 
exclamation points or question marks, smiley faces, and so on.
Keep these tasty tidbits in mind when doodling:
 
✓ Hiding the cursor: To hide the cursor temporarily during a slide show, 
press A or the equal sign (=). The cursor returns the moment you move 
the mouse, or you can press A or the equal sign again to summon it back.
 
✓ Adding emphasis: If you use the pen, be sure to say “Bam” and “Pow” 
a lot.
 
✓ Changing the pen color: If you don’t like the pen color, you can change 
it by using the faint Show menu that appears in the bottom-left corner of 
the slide. This menu has four little icons, and the second icon from the 
left displays a list of pen options: a ballpoint pen, a felt-tipped pen that 
draws a somewhat heavier line, and a highlighter, which draws in broad 
lines that are semitransparent, just like a real highlighter. (The Show 
menu disappears after a few seconds if you don’t use it, but you can get 
it to reappear by moving the mouse around a bit.)
 
You can also right-click for a floating menu of the preceding choices; however, 
this might be a little more distracting for your audience than the keystrokes 
because the audience will suddenly be privy to all your fancy footwork. 
Notice, though, that the menu allows you to change pen colors and a few 
other tricks. You can set up the pen color by clicking Set Up Slide Show in the 
Set Up group of the Slide Show tab before you begin your presentation so as 
not to distract your audience. If you have a remote mouse and you won’t have 
access to your keyboard during your presentation, I suggest that you investi-
gate the floating menu method.
When you finish your presentation, you’re given the option to keep your 
doodles as annotations in your presentation. Then you won’t have to draw 
the doodles next time.
Using the Laser Pointer
The Laser Pointer feature displays a bright red dot on the screen, which 
you can move around by moving the mouse. It’s not quite as good as using a 
real laser pointer, but if you don’t happen to have one, the PowerPoint laser 
pointer will do.
To use it, hold down the Ctrl key, then click and hold the left mouse button 
and move the mouse. The laser pointer will appear on the screen and move 
as you move the mouse.
When you release the left mouse button, the laser pointer disappears.

79
 Chapter 6: Show Time!
Rehearsing Your Slide Timings
You can use the PowerPoint Rehearsal feature to rehearse your presentation. 
The Rehearsal feature lets you know how long your presentation takes, and it 
can even set slide timings so that the slides automatically advance based on 
the timings you set during the rehearsal.
 
 To rehearse a slide show, click the Rehearse Timings button in the Set Up 
section of the Slide Show Ribbon tab (shown in the margin). This starts 
the slide show, with a special Recording dialog box visible, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Rehearsing 
a slide 
show.
 
Now rehearse your presentation. Click or use keyboard shortcuts to advance 
slides. As you rehearse, the Rehearse dialog box keeps track of how long you 
display each slide and the total length of your presentation.
When you end the presentation, PowerPoint displays a dialog box that 
gives you the option of applying or ignoring the timings recorded during the 
rehearsal to the slides in the presentation. If you were satisfied with the slide 
timings during the rehearsal, click Yes.
If you mess up during a rehearsal, click the Repeat button. Clicking this 
button restarts the rehearsal from the beginning.
Using Custom Shows
The Custom Shows feature in PowerPoint lets you create several similar slide 
shows stored in a single presentation file. For example, suppose that you’re 
asked to give presentations about company benefits to management and 
non-management staff. You can create a presentation containing slides for all 
the company benefits and then create a custom show containing only those 
slides describing benefits that are available to non-management staff. (This 
custom slide show can leave out slides such as “Executive Washrooms,” “Golf 
Days,” and “Boondoggles.”) You may then show the complete presentation to 
management but show the custom show to non-management staff.

80
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
A presentation can contain as many custom shows as you want. Each custom 
show is simply a subset of the complete presentation — comprised of 
selected slides from the complete presentation.
Creating a custom show
To create a custom show, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab on the Ribbon, click Custom Slide Show (located 
in the Start Slide Show group) and then choose Custom Shows from the 
menu that appears.
 
 This displays the Custom Shows dialog box.
 
2. Click the New button.
 
 The Define Custom Show dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Defining 
a custom 
show.
 
 
3. Type a name for the custom show in the Slide Show Name field.
 
4. Add the slides that you want to appear in the custom slide show.
 
 All the slides available in the presentation are listed in the list box on 
the left side of the Define Custom Show dialog box. To add a slide to the 
custom show, click the slide that you want to add and then click Add. 
The slide appears in the list box on the right side of the Define Custom 
Show dialog box.
 
 You don’t have to add slides to the custom show in the same order 
that the slides appear in the presentation. Slides for a custom show can 
appear in any order you want. You can also include a slide from the 
original presentation more than once in a custom show.

81
 Chapter 6: Show Time!
 
 To remove a slide that you’ve added by mistake, click the slide that you 
want to remove in the list box on the right side of the Define Custom 
Show dialog box, and then click Remove.
 
 You can use the up and down arrows near the right edge of the Define 
Custom Show dialog box to change the order of the slides in the custom 
show.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 You return to the Custom Shows dialog box.
 
6. Click Close to dismiss the Custom Shows dialog box.
Showing a custom show
To show a custom show, first open the presentation that contains the 
custom show. Then choose Slide Show➪Start Slide Show➪Custom Slide 
Show➪Custom Show on the Ribbon to summon the Custom Shows dialog 
box. Click the custom show that you want and then click the Show button.
Hiding slides
 
 If you don’t want to go to all the trouble of creating a custom show, but you 
want to exclude a few slides from a presentation, you don’t have to delete the 
slides. Instead, you can hide them. To hide a slide, select the slide and then 
choose Slide Show➪Set Up➪Hide Slide on the Ribbon (shown in the margin). 
To unhide a slide, select the slide and click the button again. (You can deter-
mine which slides have been hidden by looking at the slide in the Slides tab 
on the left. If the slide number has a slash through it, the slide is hidden.)

Chapter 7
Getting Help
In This Chapter
▶ Accessing Help
▶ Finding help that holds your hand
▶ Searching for specific Help topics
▶ Getting help on the Internet
T
he ideal way to use PowerPoint would be to have a PowerPoint expert 
sitting patiently at your side, answering your every question with a 
straightforward answer, gently correcting you when you make silly mistakes, 
and otherwise minding his or her own business. All you’d have to do is occa-
sionally toss the expert a Twinkie and let him or her outside once a day.
Short of that, the next best thing is to find out how to coax PowerPoint itself 
into giving you the answers you need. Fortunately, PowerPoint includes a 
nice built-in help feature that can provide the answers you’re looking for. No 
matter how deeply you’re lost in the PowerPoint jungle, help is never more 
than a few mouse clicks or keystrokes away.
Several Ways to Get Help
As with everything else in Office, more than one method is available for 
calling up help when you need it. The easiest thing to do would be to yell, 
“Skipper!!!” in your best Gilligan voice. Otherwise, you have the following 
options:
 
✓ Press F1 or click the Help button, located just above the right edge of 
the Ribbon. This activates PowerPoint’s main Help system, shown in 
Figure 7-1.

84
Part I: Basic PowerPoint 2010 Stuff 
 
Figure 7-1: 
Help!
 
 
✓ Whenever a dialog box is displayed, you can click the question mark 
button in the top-right corner of the dialog box to summon help.
 
✓ When you hover the mouse over an item in the Ribbon, a tooltip appears 
explaining what the item does. Many of these tooltips include the phrase 
“Press F1 for more help.” In that case, you can press F1 to get help spe-
cific to that item.
Finding Your Way Around in Help
The Help dialog box, shown in Figure 7-1, offers several ways to access the 
help you need. The following paragraphs describe the various ways you can 
work your way through PowerPoint’s help feature:
 
✓ Help window links: You can click any of the links that appear in the 
Help window to display help on a particular topic. For example, if you 
click the Working with Charts link, you’ll find a page of useful informa-
tion about creating charts.
 
 
✓ Show/Hide Table of Contents button: You can click the Show/Hide 
Table of Contents button (shown in the margin) to hide the table of con-
tents, which gives you an organized overview of the various help topics. 
If the Table of Contents is hidden, click this button again to show it.

85
 Chapter 7: Getting Help
 
✓ Search feature: If you can’t find what you’re looking for, try entering a 
word or phrase in the Search text box and clicking the Search button. 
This displays a list of topics that pertain to the word or phrase you 
entered.
 
 
✓ Pushpin icon: Normally, the Help window always displays on top. In 
many cases, this obscures your access to the PowerPoint window. If you 
don’t want the Help window to always stay on top, you can click the 
button with the pushpin icon. Then the Help window will minimize like 
any other window.
 
 
✓ Back button: You can retrace your steps by clicking the Help window’s 
Back button. You can use the Back button over and over again, retracing 
all your steps if necessary.
 
 
✓ Home button: Takes you back to the Help home page.

All about Fonts and 
Text Format ting
In This Chapter
▶ Using bold, italics, underlining, and other character effects
▶ Changing the text font, size, and color
▶ Using bullets and numbers
▶ Tabbing and indenting
▶ Spacing out lines of text
▶ Aligning text
▶ Making fanciful text with the WordArt feature
A
 good presentation is like a fireworks show: At every new slide, the 
audience gasps, “O-o-o-h. A-a-a-h.” The audience is so stunned by the 
spectacular appearance of your slides that no one really bothers to read 
them.
This chapter gets you on the road toward ooohs and aaahs by showing you 
how to format text. If you use PowerPoint templates as the basis for your pre-
sentations, your text is already formatted acceptably. To really pull out the 
pyrotechnic stops, however, you have to know a few basic formatting tricks.
Many PowerPoint text-formatting capabilities work the same as in Microsoft 
Word. If you want to format text a certain way and you know how to do it 
in Word, try formatting the same way in PowerPoint. Odds are good that it 
works.
Changing the Look of Your Text
The theme that’s applied to your presentation determines the basic look of 
the presentation’s text. However, you’ll often want to change that look, some-
times subtly and sometimes dramatically. 

90
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
You can control the most commonly used font settings by using the Font 
group in the Home tab on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 8-1.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Font 
group on the 
Home tab on 
the Ribbon.
 
If the Font group in the Home tab doesn’t provide enough options for format-
ting your text, you can call up the Font dialog box for additional options. To 
summon this dialog box, just select the dialog launcher for the Font Group. 
(The dialog launcher is the cursor at the bottom-right corner of the group.) 
Figure 8-2 shows this dialog box.
 
Figure 8-2:

It’s true — PowerPoint has many keyboard shortcuts for character format-
ting. You don’t have to know them all, though. The only ones I know and use 
routinely are the shortcuts for bold, italic, underline, and clear all formatting. 
Study these and you’ll be in good shape. You get the added bonus that these 
keyboard shortcuts are the same as the shortcuts that many other Windows 
programs use. If you’re mouse-happy and keyboard-annoyed, click away for 
goodness’ sake. What matters most is that you can easily find and use what 
you need.
Two ways to apply formatting
You can format text in two basic ways:
 
✓ To format existing text, highlight the text that you want to format. Then, 
click the toolbar button or use the keyboard shortcut for the format that 
you want. For example, to make existing text bold, highlight it and then 
click the Bold button or press Ctrl+B.

92
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
✓ To type new text using a fancy format, click the toolbar button or use 
the keyboard shortcut for the format. Then, type away. The text that 
you type is given the format you selected. To return to normal format-
ting, click the button or use the keyboard shortcut again. Or press 
Ctrl+spacebar.
Changing the size of characters
Whether text is difficult to read or you simply want to draw attention to it, 
you can make part of the text bigger than the surrounding text. The easiest 
way to change the size of your text is to use the Font Size drop-down list 
that appears next to the font name in the Font group on the Home tab. Just 
choose among the sizes that appear in the Font Size drop-down list or click in 
the Font Size box and type whatever size you want to use.
You can also change the size of your text by using the Increase Font Size 
or Decrease Font Size buttons, or by using the Ctrl+Shift+> or Ctrl+Shift+< 
keyboard shortcuts. These commands increase or decrease the font size 
in steps.
 
If you type more text than will fit in a text placeholder, PowerPoint will auto-
matically make your text smaller so that the text will fit within the placeholder.
Choosing text fonts
If you don’t like the looks of a text font, you can switch easily to a differ-
ent font. To change the font for existing text, select the text. Then click the 
arrow next to the Font control (found in the Font group of the Home tab) 
and choose the font that you want to use. If you’re allergic to the mouse, you 
can get to the font list by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F. Then you can use the up- or 
down-arrow keys to choose the font you want to use.
Here are a gaggle of additional points to ponder concerning fonts:
 
✓ Although you can change the font from the Font dialog box, the Font 
control on the Ribbon has one major advantage over the Font dialog 
box: It displays each of your fonts by using the font itself, so you can see 
what each font looks like before you apply it to your text. In contrast, 
the Font dialog box displays the name of each font by using the standard 
Windows system font.
 
✓ If you want to change the font for all the slides in your presentation, 
switch to Slide Master View and then change the font. Details on how to 
do so are covered in Chapter 11.

93
 Chapter 8: All about Fonts and Text Format ting
 
✓ PowerPoint automatically moves the fonts that you use the most to the 
head of the font list. This feature makes picking your favorite font even 
easier.
 
✓ Don’t overdo it with fonts! Just because you have many different font 
choices doesn’t mean that you should try to use them all on the same 
slide. Don’t mix more than two or three typefaces on a slide, and use 
fonts consistently throughout the presentation.
 
✓ If you want to set a font that is used consistently throughout a presen-
tation, the best way to do so is to set the font for the presentation’s 
theme. For more information, see Chapter 9.
Adding color to your text
Color is an excellent way to draw attention to text in a slide. To change text 
color, first select the text whose color you want to change. Then click the 
Font Color button and choose the color that you want to use from the color 
menu that appears.
 
If you don’t like any color that the Font Color button offers, click More Colors. 
A bigger dialog box with more color choices appears. If you still can’t find the 
right shade of teal, click the Custom tab and have at it. Check out Chapter 10 if 
you need further help with colors.
If you want to change the text color for your entire presentation, do so in the 
Slide Master View (see Chapter 11 for details). And you can refer to Chapter 9 
for information about changing font colors via the theme.
Adding shadows
Adding a shadow behind your text can make the text stand out against its 
background, which makes the entire slide easier to read. For that reason, 
many of the templates supplied with PowerPoint use shadows.
 
 You can apply a shadow to any text by first selecting the text and then click-
ing the Text Shadow button, found in the Font section of the Home tab. If you 
want all of the text on a slide to be shadowed, however, you should use the 
Slide Master View to create the shadow format. For more information, peek 
ahead to Chapter 11.

94
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
Big Picture Text Format ting
The Paragraph group on the Home tab on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 8-3, 
has several buttons that apply formats to entire paragraphs. The following 
sections describe the most common uses for the buttons in this group.
 
Figure 8-3: 
The 
Paragraph 
group on the 
Home tab on 
the Ribbon.
 
Biting the bulleted list
Most presentations have at least some slides that include a bulleted list, 
which is a series of paragraphs accented by special characters lovingly 
known as bullets. In the old days, you had to add bullets one at a time. 
Nowadays, PowerPoint comes with a semi-automatic bullet shooter that is 
illegal in 27 states.
 
PowerPoint lets you create fancy bullets that are based on bitmap pictures 
rather than simple dots and check marks. Before you go crazy with picture 
bullets, take a look at the basic way to bite the bullet.
To add bullets to a paragraph or series of paragraphs, take aim and fire, 
like so:
 
1. Highlight the paragraphs to which you want to add bullets.
 
 To add a bullet to just one paragraph, you don’t have to highlight the 
entire paragraph. Just place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph.
 
2. Click the Bullets button found in the Paragraph group of the 
Home tab.
 
 PowerPoint adds a bullet to each paragraph that you select.
The Bullets button works like a toggle: Press it once to add bullets and press 
it again to remove bullets. To remove bullets from previously bulleted text, 
therefore, you select the text and click the Bullets button again.
If you don’t like the appearance of the bullets that PowerPoint uses, you can 
select a different bullet character, picture, or even a motion clip by clicking 

95
 Chapter 8: All about Fonts and Text Format ting
the down arrow at the right side of the Bullets button. This action reveals a 
list of choices for various types of bullets.
If none of the bullets in this list are acceptable, you can bring up the Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box by clicking the arrow at the right of the Bullets 
button and then choosing Bullets and Numbers. This summons the Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4. From this dialog box, you 
can choose a different bullet character, change the bullet’s color, or change 
its size relative to the text size.
 
Figure 8-4: 
The 
Bullets and 
Numbering 
dialog box.
 
The following paragraphs point out some important tidbits to keep in mind 
when you use bullets:
 
✓ Customize bullet characters: You can choose from among several 
collections of bullet characters that are available. If you don’t like 
any of the bullet characters displayed for you in the dialog box, click 
Customize in the lower-right corner of the dialog box. This brings up 
a dialog box that lists a variety of useful alternative bullet characters, 
such as pointing fingers, a skull and crossbones, and a time bomb. Pick 
the bullet that you want to use and then click OK. If you can’t find a 
bullet that suits your fancy, choose a different font in the Font control 
drop-down list.
 
✓ Change the size of bullet characters: If the bullet characters don’t seem 
large enough, increase the size in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
The size is specified as a percentage of the text size.
 
✓ Change the color of bullet characters: To change the bullet color, 
use the Color drop-down list to choose the color that you want to use. 
Colors from the current color scheme appear in the drop-down menu 
that appears. For additional color choices, choose More Colors to call 
up a dialog box that offers a complete range of color choices. (For more 
information about using colors, see Chapter 9.)

96
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
✓ Use images for your bullet characters: To use a picture bullet, click the 
Picture button located in the lower right of the Bullets and Numbering 
dialog box. This click brings up the Picture Bullet dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 8-5. Select the picture that you want to use for your bullet and 
then click OK. (You can use the Import button in this dialog box to use 
your own bitmap file for a bullet.)
 
Figure 8-5: 
Using a pic-
ture bullet.
 
 
You can use certain bullet characters for good comic effect in your presenta-
tions. Be creative, but also be careful. A thumbs-down bullet next to the name 
of your boss might get a laugh, but it might also get you fired. One cool thing 
to do with bullets when you pitch a product or service is to use your logo as 
a bullet. It subliminally grinds your image in their brains until they submit to 
your will.
Creating numbered lists
If you want your slide to include a numbered list, use the Numbering button, 
which appears next to the Bullets button on the Home tab. When you click 
the Numbering button, PowerPoint adds simple numbers to the selected 
paragraphs.
If you want to change the numbering format, click the arrow next to the 
Numbering button to display a list of number style choices. Then you can 
select the style that suits your fancy.
If none of the styles in the list are right, choose Bullets and Numbering to 
reveal the numbering options shown on the Numbered tab of the Bullets and 
Numbering dialog box. See Figure 8-6.

97
 Chapter 8: All about Fonts and Text Format ting
 
Figure 8-6: 
More ways 
to format 
numbers.
 
 
Normally, the starting number for each list reverts to 1 for each new slide. 
What if you have a list that has more items than can fit on one slide, such as a 
David Letterman–style Top Ten list? In that case, you can type the first half of 
the list on one slide and then type the second half of the list on a second slide. 
Next, right-click the first item on the second slide and choose Bullets and 
Numbering from the menu that appears. Then, change the Start At value to the 
number at which you want the second part of the list to begin. For example, if 
the first slide has five numbered items, change the Start At value for the first 
item on the second slide to 6.
Setting tabs and indents
PowerPoint enables you to set tab stops to control the placement of text 
within a text object. For most presentations, you don’t have to fuss with tabs. 
Each paragraph is indented according to its level in the outline, and the tem-
plate that you use to create the presentation presets the amount of indenta-
tion for each outline level.
If you’re stubborn about tabs, you can mess with the indent settings and tab 
stops — that is, if you’re adventurous and have no real work to do today. 
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Click the Slide button to switch to Normal View.
 
 You can’t mess with tabs or indents in Notes Page View or Slide Sorter 
View.
 
2. If the rulers aren’t visible, summon them by clicking the View tab on 
the Ribbon and then selecting the Ruler check box in the Show/Hide 
group.
 
 Rulers appear above and to the left of the presentation window and 
show the current tab and indentation settings.

98
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
3. Select the text object whose tabs or indents you want to change.
 
 Each text object has its own tabs and indents settings. After you click a 
text object, the ruler shows that object’s tabs and indents.
 
4. Click the ruler to add a tab stop.
 
 Move the cursor to the ruler location where you want to add a tab stop 
and then click. A tab stop appears.
 
5. Grab the indentation doohickey and then drag it to change the 
indentation.
 
 The indentation doohickey (that’s not its official name) is the control 
that looks like an hourglass sitting on a little box, normally positioned 
at the left side of the ruler. It actually consists of three parts: the top 
upside-down triangle sets the indentation for the first line of the para-
graph, the middle triangle sets the indentation for the remaining lines 
of the paragraph, and the box at the bottom sets the indentation for the 
paragraph. Try dragging the different parts of the indentation doohickey 
to see what happens. Have fun. Good luck.
Each text object is initially set up with default tab stops set at every inch. 
When you add a tab stop, any default tab stops located to the left of the new 
tab stop disappear.
 
To remove a tab stop, use the mouse to drag the tab stop off the ruler. (For 
instance, click the tab stop, drag it off the ruler, and then release the mouse 
button.)
Don’t even bother with this 
stuff about tab types
PowerPoint isn’t limited to just boring left-
aligned tabs. In all, it has four distinct types of 
tabs: left, right, center, and decimal. The square 
button that appears at the far-left side of the 
ruler when you select text tells you which type 
of tab is added when you click the ruler. Click 
this button to cycle through the four types of 
tabs:
 ✓ Standard left-aligned tab: Press Tab to 
advance the text to the tab stop.
 ✓ Right-aligned tab: Text is aligned flush right 
with the tab stop.
 ✓ Centered tab: Text lines up centered over 
the tab stop.
 ✓ Decimal tab: Numbers line up with the dec-
imal point centered over the tab stop.

99
 Chapter 8: All about Fonts and Text Format ting
Spacing out
Feeling a little spaced out? Try tightening the space between text lines. 
Feeling cramped? Space out the lines a little. These steps show you how to 
do it all:
 
1. Highlight the paragraph — or paragraphs — whose line spacing you 
want to change.
 
2. Click the Line Spacing button and then select the amount of line spac-
ing you want.
 
 The Line Spacing button displays the most common line spacing 
options: 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. If you want to set the line spacing to a 
value that’s not shown on the Line Spacing button, select Line Spacing 
Options to display the Paragraph dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Change the 
line spacing.
 
Lining things up
PowerPoint enables you to control the way your text lines up on the slide. 
You can center text, line it up flush left or flush right, or justify it. You can 
change these alignments by using the alignment buttons in the Paragraph 
group on the Home tab. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts described 
in Table 8-2.
Here are some semirandom thoughts on aligning paragraphs:
 
✓ Centered text lines up right down the middle of the slide. Actually, 
text lines up down the middle of the text object that contains the text; a 
text line appears centered on the slide only if the text object is centered 
on the slide.
 
✓ Bulleted lists look best when left-aligned. Otherwise, the bullets don’t 
line up.

Making columns
 
 Most slides place all their text in a single column. However, you can easily 
create multiple columns by using the Columns button, found in the 
Paragraph section of the Home tab. To create a one-, two-, or three-column 
layout, just click the Columns button and then choose one, two, or three col-
umns from the menu that appears. If you want more than three columns, 
select the More Columns command and then choose the number of columns 
you want to use.
Creating Fancy Text with WordArt
Previous versions of PowerPoint included a feature called WordArt that let 
you insert special objects that could incorporate fancy text effects such as 
gradient fills or curved paths. For PowerPoint 2010, Microsoft has integrated 
WordArt into PowerPoint, so that you can apply WordArt formatting to any 
bit of text in your presentation just by highlighting the text and applying the 
WordArt formats. Figure 8-8 is an example of what you can do with WordArt 
in just a couple of minutes.
Follow these steps to transform mundane text into something worth looking at:
 
1. Select the text you want to apply WordArt formatting to.
 
 The text can be anywhere in your presentation. For example, you can 
apply WordArt formatting to a slide title or body text.
 
2. Click the Drawing Tools Format tab.

101
 Chapter 8: All about Fonts and Text Format ting
 
Figure 8-8: 
You, too, 
can create 
fancy text 
effects like 
this using 
WordArt.
 
 
 The Drawing Tools Format tab includes a WordArt Styles group, shown 
in Figure 8-9. As you can see, this Ribbon group includes several pre-
configured WordArt styles as well as buttons that let you control the 
text fill, outline style, and text effects such as shadows and glowing.

3. Click the More button found at the bottom of the scroll bar to the right 
of the predefined WordArt styles.
 
 The WordArt Quick Styles gallery appears, as shown in Figure 8-10.
 
4. Select the WordArt style that most closely resembles the formatting 
you want to apply.
 
 Don’t worry if none of the gallery choices exactly match the effect you 
want; you can tweak the text’s appearance later.
 
5. Fool around with other WordArt controls in the WordArt Styles group 
of the Drawing Tools Format tab.
 
 Table 8-3 describes the other controls in the WordArt Styles group. 
Experiment with these controls as much as you want until you get the 
text to look just right.

Chapter 9
Designing Your Slides
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how to use themes
▶ Using theme colors, fonts, and effects
▶ Playing with the background
O
ne of the most bothersome tasks of putting together a good PowerPoint 
presentation is making the presentation look good. Always wanting to 
be helpful in such matters, Microsoft has endowed PowerPoint with a feature 
called themes that lets you create good-looking slides in minutes. One of the 
best features of themes is that they work not only in PowerPoint, but also 
in Word and Excel. Thus, you can use themes to create PowerPoint presen-
tations, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets that have a consistent 
appearance.
The main access to PowerPoint themes is from the Design tab on the Ribbon. 
This entire chapter is devoted to this Design tab. To keep things simple, I 
approach this most useful tab from left to right even though that’s not always 
the order in which you use the controls it contains.
Looking at the Design Tab
To get things started, Figure 9-1 shows the Design tab on the Ribbon. As you 
can see, the Design tab contains several groups of controls that let you set 
various aspects of the slide design used within your presentation. You can 
summon the Design tab by clicking it on the Ribbon or by using the handy 
keyboard shortcut Alt+G.
The following list describes the general purpose of each group of controls on 
the Design tab:
 
✓ Page Setup: Lets you change the orientation of your slides from 
Landscape to Portrait and control other page setup options.
 
✓ Themes: Lets you apply a theme to the presentation. This is the group 
you work with most while you play with the design of your slides.

106
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 9-1: 
The Design 
tab.
 
 
✓ Background: Lets you apply a color effect or a picture to the slide 
background.
Designing the Page Setup
The Page Setup group consists of a Slide Orientation control that lets you flip 
the slide from Landscape mode (the default) to Portrait mode. You should 
use Portrait mode only if you intend to print the slides on transparency mas-
ters and project them with an old-fashioned overhead projector, or if you 
intend to present the slide show on a tablet computer or other PC that has a 
screen with portrait orientation.
If you click the Page Setup button in the Page Setup group, you’re rewarded 
with the Page Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-2. This dialog box gives 
you extra control over your presentation’s page setup.
The following list describes the controls in this dialog box:

107
 Chapter 9: Designing Your Slides
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Page 
Setup dialog 
box.
 
 
✓ Slides Sized For: This drop-down list lets you set the size of your slides 
based on how you plan to present them. The most common is to present 
the slides on a standard computer screen, which has an aspect ratio of 
4:3. (Aspect ratio is the ratio of the screen’s width to its height. Although 
4:3 is a common aspect ratio, many newer computers use wide-screen dis-
plays, which usually have an aspect ratio of 16:10.) Other options on this 
drop-down list include different screen ratios (suitable for wide-screen 
displays), standard sized paper, and even 35mm slides. A Custom option 
even lets you set whatever width and height you want for your slides.
 
✓ Width: Lets you set a custom width for your slides.
 
✓ Height: Lets you set a custom height for your slides.
 
✓ Number Slides From: If your slides include numbers, this option lets 
you set the number for the first slide. The default is 1.
 
✓ Orientation: Lets you set the orientation to portrait (tall and skinny) or 
landscape (short and fat). You can set the setting separately for your 
slides, handouts, and notes. The most common setting is for the slides 
to use landscape orientation and the notes and handouts to use portrait.
Working with Themes
The Themes group of the Design tab lets you select a theme to apply to your 
slides. PowerPoint 2010 comes with a ton of carefully crafted themes that 
give a professional look to your presentations. If you’re somewhat artsy, you 
can design your own themes as well.
A theme is a set of design elements that are applied to one or more slides in a 
presentation. Each theme includes several basic components:
 
✓ A set of colors that work well together. Each theme has four colors that 
can be used for text or backgrounds and six colors that can be used for 
accents.
 
✓ A set of fonts that looks good when used together. Each theme has a 
font used for headings and a font used for regular text.

108
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
✓ A set of background styles, which are a combination of background 
colors and effects such as patterns or gradient fills.
 
✓ A set of design effects such as line and fill styles and line styles.

Applying themes
To apply a theme to an entire presentation, simply click the theme you want 
to apply in the Themes group on the Design tab. If the theme you want to 
apply isn’t visible, use the scroll buttons on the right side of the Themes 
group to display additional themes.
 
To see a preview of how your presentation will appear with a particular 
theme, hover the mouse over that theme in the gallery. After a moment, the 
current slide momentarily appears formatted with the theme. If you move the 
mouse off the theme without actually clicking the theme, the current slide 
reverts to its previous formatting.
 
You can click the down arrow in the scroll bars in the Theme gallery, which 
displays an expanded list of themes, as shown in Figure 9-3. As you can see, 
this window displays PowerPoint’s built-in themes and also includes links that 
let you search online for additional themes. A link even lets you save the cur-
rent combination of theme elements as a new theme.
 
Not all the slides in a presentation have to follow the same theme. To apply a 
theme to a single slide — or a set of slides — select the slide(s). Then, right-
click the theme you want to apply and choose Apply to Selected Slides.

109
 Chapter 9: Designing Your Slides
 
Figure 9-3: 
The Theme 
gallery.
 
Using theme colors
Each PowerPoint theme includes a built-in color scheme, which consists of 
sets of colors chosen by color professionals. Microsoft paid these people 
enormous sums of money to debate the merits of using mauve text on a teal 
background. You can use these professionally designed color schemes, or 
you can create your own if you think that you have a better eye than the 
Microsoft-hired color guns.
As far as I’m concerned, the color schemes in PowerPoint themes are the 
best things to come along since Peanut M&Ms. Without color schemes, 
people like me are free to pick and choose from among the 16 million or so 
colors that PowerPoint lets you incorporate into your slides. The resulting 
slides can easily appear next to Cher and Lindsay Lohan in People magazine’s 
annual “Worst Dressed of the Year” issue.
Each color scheme has 12 colors, with each color designated for a particular 
use, as shown in this list:
 
✓ Four Text/Background colors: These four colors are designed to be the 
primary colors for the presentation. One from each pair is used for text, 
and the other for the background. (You could use the same color for 
both, but that would make the slides impossible to read!)
 
✓ Six accent colors: These colors are used for various bits and pieces of 
your slides that complement the basic text and background colors.
 
✓ Two hyperlink colors: These colors are used only when your presenta-
tion includes hyperlinks.

110
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
When you apply a theme, the color scheme for that theme is applied along 
with the other elements of the theme. However, PowerPoint lets you change 
the color scheme from the scheme that comes with the theme. For example, 
you can apply a theme such as Opulent but then change the color scheme to 
the scheme from the Verve theme.
Applying a color scheme
To apply a color scheme without applying a different theme, click the Theme 
Colors button at the top-right of the Themes group. This click reveals the 
drop-down list shown in Figure 9-4. Then you can choose the scheme you 
want to apply.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The Colors 
drop-down 
list.
 
Creating your own color scheme
If you don’t like any color schemes that come with the built-in themes, you 
can create your own color scheme. Here are the steps:
 
1. Select a color scheme that’s close to the one you want to use.
 
 
Be warned that after you deviate from the preselected color scheme 
combinations, you’d better have some color sense. If you can’t tell char-
treuse from lime, you should leave this stuff to the pros.
 
2. Click the Theme Colors button and then choose Create New Theme 
Colors.
 
 The Create New Theme Colors dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-5.

colors.
 
 
3. Click the button for the color you want to change.
 
 For example, to change the first accent color, click the Accent 1 button. 
You then see a gallery of color choices, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
Figure 9-6:

color.
 
 
4. Pick a color you like.
 
 As you can see, a plethora of color choices are available. This gallery 
reminds me of the shelf of paint color chips in the paint section of a 
hardware store.
 
5. If you don’t like any of the choices, click the More Colors button.
 
 This brings up the Colors dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-7. As you can 
see, PowerPoint displays what looks like a tie-dyed version of Chinese 
checkers. (Note that this dialog box comes up with the Standard tab 
selected. If you used the Custom tab the last time you used this dialog 
box, the Custom tab will be selected instead.)

6. Click the color that you want and then click OK.
 
 After you click OK, you’re whisked back to the Create New Theme Colors 
dialog box.
 
7. (Optional) Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for any other colors you want to 
change.
 
8. Choose Save.
 
 The new color scheme is saved.
 
The Standard tab of the Colors dialog box (refer to Figure 9-7) shows 127 pop-
ular colors, plus white, black, and shades of gray. If you want to use a color 
that doesn’t appear in the dialog box, click the Custom tab. This step draws 
forth the custom color controls, as shown in Figure 9-8. From this tab in the 
dialog box, you can construct any of the 16 million colors that are theoreti-
cally possible with PowerPoint. You need a PhD in physics to figure out how 
to adjust the Red, Green, and Blue controls, though. Mess around with this 
stuff if you want, but you’re on your own.

113
 Chapter 9: Designing Your Slides
Using theme fonts
Theme fonts are similar to theme colors, but theme fonts have fewer choices. 
Although there are 12 colors per theme, there are only two fonts: one for 
headings, the other for body text.
If you don’t want to use the fonts associated with the theme you’ve chosen 
for your presentation, you can use the Theme Fonts button at the right side 
of the Themes group on the Design tab on the Ribbon to choose fonts from 
a different theme. Then the fonts you select are applied throughout your 
presentation.
 
Note that changing the theme font is not the same as changing the font via the 
Font controls found in the Font group of the Home tab. When you use the Font 
controls on the Home tab, you’re applying direct formatting. Direct formatting 
temporarily overrides the font setting specified by the theme. As a general 
rule, you should use theme fonts to set the fonts used throughout a presenta-
tion. Use direct formatting sparingly — when you want to create a word or two 
in a font that differs from the rest of the presentation.
You can change the font used in a theme by clicking the Theme Fonts button 
and then choosing Create New Theme Fonts. This brings up the Create New 
Theme Fonts dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-9. Here you can change the font 
used for headings and body text.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Changing 
theme fonts.
 
Applying theme effects
Another major component of PowerPoint themes are the theme effects, which 
apply subtle variations to the graphical look of your presentations. Theme 
effects are applied automatically whenever you apply a theme. However, you 
can apply theme effects from a different theme by clicking the Effects button 
at the right side of the Themes group on the Design tab on the Ribbon. This 
brings up the Theme Effects gallery, as shown in Figure 9-10. You can choose 
any of the theme effects listed.

114
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 9-10: 
Changing 
theme 
effects.
 
Using Background Styles
A background style is a combination of a background color chosen from a 
theme color scheme and a background fill effect. The color scheme always 
includes four colors that can be used for the background — two light colors 
and two dark colors. In addition, you can choose from three background fill 
effects. These three fills are Subtle, Moderate, and Intense. For example, the 
Subtle fill might be a solid color, the Moderate fill might be a gentle pattern 
applied to the color, and the Intense fill might be a bold gradient fill.
Each combination of the four background colors and three background fills 
is a background style. Thus, each theme provides a total of 12 background 
styles.
To apply one of the theme’s background styles to your presentation, use the 
Background Styles control in the Background group on the Design tab. This 
control reveals the Background Styles gallery, as shown in Figure 9-11.

 Chapter 9: Designing Your Slides
Using a gradient fill
You may have noticed that the slide background used in many PowerPoint 
templates is not a solid color. Instead, the color is gradually shaded from top 
to bottom. This type of shading — gradient fill — creates an interesting visual 
effect. For example, look at the slide shown in Figure 9-12. This slide was 
based on the standard Office Theme that comes with PowerPoint 2010. The 
background is light gray in the center that fades to darker gray on the edges.
 
Figure 9-12: 
Using a 
gradient fill 
to create an 
interesting 
background.
 
You can create your own custom gradient fill by following these steps:
 
1. Choose the slide that you want to shade.
 
 This step isn’t necessary if you want to apply the shading to all slides in 
the presentation.
 
2. Click the Background Styles button in the Background group of the 
Design tab on the Ribbon.
 
 The Background Styles gallery appears.
 
3. Click Format Background.
 
 This brings up the Format Background dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-13.
 
4. Select the Fill option on the left if it isn’t already selected.

6. Set the gradient fill options the way you want them.
 
 You have to play with the controls until you get a feel for how they 
work. Start by selecting the present colors, which let you choose one 
of several predefined fill patterns. Then play with the controls until you 
get the fill to look the way you want. You can choose the colors to use 
for the fill, the transparency level, the direction, and several variants for 
each option.
 
7. Click OK.
Using other background effects
Besides gradient fills, you can use the Format Background dialog box to 
create several other interesting types of backgrounds. For example, you can 
assign a picture of your choosing, or you can use one of several predefined 
patterns supplied with PowerPoint.
To use a texture, click the Picture or Texture Fill radio button. Then click the 
Texture button to reveal the Texture gallery, as shown in Figure 9-14.
You can also use the Picture or Texture Fill radio button to select an image 
file of your own. Just click the File button and then select the file you want 
to use. Or, you can import an image from the Clipboard or select a clip art 
image. The remaining controls on this dialog box let you further tweak the 
appearance of the picture or text you select.

I
f you plan to run your presentation on your computer’s screen or on a 
computer projector, you can use (or abuse) a bagful of exciting onscreen 
PowerPoint animations. The audience members probably won’t be fooled 
into thinking that you hired Disney to create your slides, but they’ll be 
impressed all the same. Animations are just one more example of how 
PowerPoint can make even the dullest content look spectacular.
This chapter begins with slide transitions, which are not technically anima-
tions because they don’t involve movement of individual items on a slide. 
However, slide transitions are usually used in concert with animations to 
create presentations that are as much fun to watch as they are informative.
Using Slide Transitions
A transition is how PowerPoint gets from one slide to the next during an 
onscreen slide show. The normal way to segue from slide to slide is simply 
cutting to the new slide — effective, yes, but also boring. PowerPoint enables 
you to assign any of the more than 50 different special effects to each slide 
transition. For example, you can have the next slide scoot over the top of the 
current slide from any direction, or you can have the current slide scoot off 
the screen in any direction to reveal the next slide. You can have slides fade 
out, dissolve into each other, open up like Venetian blinds, or spin in like 
spokes on a wheel.
Slide transitions are controlled via the Transitions tab of the Ribbon, as 
shown in Figure 10-1.

120
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 10-1: 
The 
Transitions 
tab.
 
The Transitions tab consists of three groups of controls, as described in the 
following list:
 
✓ Preview: This group includes a single control — a Preview button — 
that displays a preview of the transition effect you selected for the cur-
rent slide.
 
✓ Transition to This Slide: This group lets you select the transition effect 
that will be used to display the current slide.
 
✓ Timing: This group lets you select options that affect how the transition 
effect is applied to the slide, such as how quickly the transition occurs 
and whether it’s triggered by a mouse click or automatically after a time 
delay.
To create a slide transition, follow these steps:
 
1. Move to the slide to which you want to apply the transition.
 
 Note that the transition applies when you come to the slide you apply 
the transition to, not when you go to the next slide. For example, if you 
apply a transition to slide 3, the transition is displayed when you move 
from slide 2 to slide 3, not when you move from slide 3 to slide 4.
 
 If you want to apply the animation scheme to all your slides, you can 
skip this step because it won’t matter which slide you start from.
 
 
If you want to apply different transitions to different slides, you might 
prefer to work in Slide Sorter View (click the Slide Sorter View button 
near the bottom-right corner of the screen), which allows you to see 
more slides at once. If you’re going to use the same transition for all 
your slides, though, no benefit comes from switching to Slide Sorter 
View.
 
2. Select the transition you want to apply from the Transition to This 
Slide section of the Transitions Ribbon tab.
 
 If you want, you can display the complete gallery of transition effects by 
clicking the More button at the bottom right of the mini-gallery of transi-
tion effects displayed within the Ribbon. Figure 10-2 shows the complete 
Transitions gallery.
 
 Note that when you select a transition, PowerPoint previews the transi-
tion by animating the current slide. If you want to see the preview again, 
just click the transition again.

121
 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
 
Figure 10-2: 
The 
Transitions 
gallery.
 
 
3. Use the Effect Options drop-down list to select a variation of the transi-
tion effect you selected in Step 2.
 
 The available variations depend on the transition you’ve chosen. For 
example, if you choose the Wipe transition, the following variations are 
available:
 
• From Right
 
• From Left
 
• From Top
 
• From Bottom
 
• From Top-Right
 
• From Bottom-Right
 
• From Top-Left
 
• From Bottom-Left
 
4. If you want, use the Sound drop-down list to apply a sound effect.
 
 The Sound drop-down list lists a collection of standard transition 
sounds, such as applause, a cash register, and the standard whoosh. You 
can also choose Other Sound to use your own .wav file.
 
5. Use the Duration drop-down list to control how fast the transition 
should proceed.
 
 The default is 1 second, but you can specify a slower or faster speed if 
you want.
 
6. Use the On Mouse Click or After options to indicate how the transition 
should be triggered.
 
 If you want to control the pace of the slide show yourself, select the On 
Mouse Click check box. Then, the slide will remain visible until you click 
the mouse. If you want the slide to advance automatically after a delay, 
select the After check box and specify the time delay.

122
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
To apply the animation to the entire presentation, click Apply to All. This 
applies the animation to all the slides in the presentation.
Here are some additional points to keep in mind when using slide transitions:
 
✓ Consider computer speed: Transition effects look better on faster com-
puters, which have more raw processing horsepower to implement the 
fancy pixel dexterity required to produce good-looking transitions. If 
your computer is a bit slow, change the speed setting to Fast so the tran-
sition won’t drag.
 
✓ Select sets of transitions: Some of the transition effects come in 
matched sets that apply the same effect from different directions. You 
can create a cohesive set of transitions by alternating among these 
related effects from slide to slide. For example, set up the first slide with 
Wipe Right, the second slide with Wipe Left, the third with Wipe Down, 
and so on.
 
✓ Preview transitions: When you work in Slide Sorter View, you can click 
the little star icon beneath each slide to preview the transition for that 
slide. Also, the automatic slide timing is shown beneath the slide if you 
set the slide to advance automatically.
Using the Animations Tab
Besides slide transitions, the most common type of animation in PowerPoint 
is adding entrance and exit effects to the text that appears on the slide. This 
effect is especially useful for bullet lists because it lets you display the list 
one item at a time. You can have each item appear out of nowhere, drop from 
the top of the screen, march in from the left or right, or do a back somersault 
followed by two cartwheels and a double-twist flip (talc, please!).
This type of animation is often called a build effect because it lets you build 
your points one by one. It’s easy to apply this type of animation using the 
Animations tab of the Ribbon, shown in Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
The 
Animations 
tab.
 

123
 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
The Animations tab consists of four groups of controls, as described in the 
following list:
 
✓ Preview: This group includes a single control — a Preview button — 
that displays a preview of the animation effects you selected for the cur-
rent slide.
 
✓ Animation: This group lets you select one of several predefined anima-
tions for the selected object.
 
✓ Advanced Animation: The controls in this group let you create 
custom animations with features the basic animations provided via the 
Animation group. For more information, see the section “Customizing 
Your Animation” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Timing: This group lets you set the timing of the animation. For more 
information, see the section “Timing your animations,” later in this 
chapter.
To apply an animation effect, first select the text box that you want to ani-
mate. Then, choose the animation style from the Animation gallery on the 
Animations tab.
Like other PowerPoint galleries, the Animation gallery includes a More button 
(at the bottom right) that summons the complete gallery, as shown in 
Figure 10-4.
 
Figure 10-4: 
The 
Animation 
gallery.
 

124
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
After you apply a basic animation, you can use the Effect Options drop-down 
list to select one of several variations of the animation. For example, if you 
choose the Fly In animation, the Effect Options drop-down list lets you pick 
the direction from which the object will fly on to the slide.
 
Notice that there are several More… menu items at the bottom of the 
Animation gallery. You can click any of these buttons to reveal even more pre-
animation types.
For more complex animations, you need to use custom animations as 
described in the next section, “Customizing Your Animation.”
Customizing Your Animation
Custom animation is the nitty-gritty of PowerPoint animation. Custom anima-
tion is the only way to apply text animation that’s more complicated than the 
predefined Fade, Wipe, or Fly In styles of the Animate drop-down list. In addi-
tion to animating text, custom animation lets you animate other objects on 
your slides, such as pictures, shapes, and charts.
Understanding custom animation
Before I get into the details of setting up custom animation, you need to 
understand some basic concepts. Don’t worry — this won’t get too technical. 
But you need to know this stuff before you start creating custom animations.
For starters, you can apply custom animations to any object on a slide, 
whether it’s a text placeholder, a drawing object such as an AutoShape or a 
text box, or a clip art picture. For text objects, you can apply the animation to 
the text object as a whole or to individual paragraphs within the object. You 
can also specify whether the effect goes all at once, word by word, or letter 
by letter. And you can indicate whether the effect happens automatically or 
whether PowerPoint waits for you to click the mouse or press Enter to initi-
ate the animation.
Custom animation lets you create four basic types of animation effects for 
slide objects:
 
✓ Entrance effect: This is how an object enters the slide. If you don’t 
specify an entrance effect, the object starts in whatever position that 
you placed it on the slide. If you want to be more creative, though, you 
can have objects appear via any of the 52 different entrance effects, such 
as Appear, Blinds, Fade, Descend, Boomerang, Bounce, Sling, and many 
others.

125
 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
 
✓ Emphasis effect: This effect lets you draw attention to an object that’s 
already on the slide. PowerPoint offers 31 different emphasis effects, 
including Change Fill Color, Change Font Size, Grow/Shrink, Spin, Teeter, 
Flicker, Color Blend, Blast, and many more.
 
✓ Exit effect: This is how an object leaves the slide. Most objects don’t 
have exit effects, but if you want an object to leave, you can apply one 
of the 52 different effects — which are similar to the entrance effects — 
Disappear, Blinds, Peek Out, Ease Out, Spiral Out, and so on.
 
✓ Motion path: Motion paths are the most interesting types of custom 
animation. A motion path lets you create a track along which the object 
travels when animated. PowerPoint provides you with 64 predefined 
motion paths, such as circles, stars, teardrops, spirals, springs, and so 
on. If that’s not enough, you can draw your own custom path to make an 
object travel anywhere on the slide you want it to go.
 
 If the motion path begins off the slide and ends somewhere on the slide, 
the motion path effect is similar to an entrance effect. If the path begins on 
the slide but ends off the slide, the motion path effect is like an exit effect. 
And if the path begins and ends on the slide, it is similar to an emphasis 
effect. In that case, when the animation starts, the object appears, travels 
along its path, and then zips off the slide.
 
 To draw a custom motion path, click the Add Effect button in the Custom 
Animation pane, choose Motion Paths Draw, and then choose Draw Custom 
Path and select one of the motion path drawing tools from the menu that 
appears. The tools include straight lines, curves, freeform shapes, and 
scribbles. You can then draw your motion path using the tool you selected.
You can create more than one animation for a given object. For example, you 
can give an object an entrance effect, an emphasis effect, and an exit effect. 
That lets you bring the object onscreen, draw attention to it, and then have it 
leave. If you want, you can have several emphasis or motion path effects for 
a single object. You can also have more than one entrance and exit effect, but 
in most cases, one will do.
Each effect that you apply has one or more property settings that you can 
tweak to customize the effect. All the effects have a Speed setting that lets you 
set the speed for the animation. Some effects have an additional property set-
ting that lets you control the range of an object’s movement. (For example, the 
Spin effect has an Amount setting that governs how far the object spins.)
 
If you want, you can create a trigger that causes an animation effect to operate 
when you click an object on the slide. For example, you might create a trigger 
so that all the text in a text placeholder pulsates in when you click the slide 
title. To do so, first add the animation effect to the text. Then, click Trigger in 
the Advanced Animation group and choose On Click Of. A list of all objects on 
the slide that can be clicked is displayed; select the Title placeholder. (You 
can also trigger an animation when a specific location is reached during play-
back of a video file. For more information, refer to Chapter 16.)

126
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
Using the Animation pane
 
 The Animation pane is a task pane that appears to the right of the slide and 
displays important information about the animations you have added to your 
slides. The Custom Animation task pane is hidden by default, but I recom-
mend you turn it on before you start adding custom animations to your 
slides. To turn on the Custom Animation task pane, just click the Animation 
Pane button (shown in the margin) in the Advanced section of the Animation 
Ribbon tab.
Figure 10-5 shows how the Animation pane appears for a slide that has not 
yet had any animations added to it.
 
Figure 10-5: 
The 
Animation 
pane.
 
In the sections that follow, you find out how to use the Animation pane as 
you create custom animations.
Adding an effect
To animate an object on a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. In Normal View, call up the slide that contains the object you want to 
animate and then click the object to select it.
 
 For example, to animate text paragraphs, select the text placeholder 
that holds the text.

127
 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
 
2. If you haven’t already done so, click the Animation Pane button.
 
 This step opens the Custom Animation task pane.
 
3. Click the Animations tab on the Ribbon.
 
4. Click the Add Animation button and then select the effect you want to 
create from the menu that appears.
 
 Clicking the Add Animation button menu reveals a menu that lists the 
four types of effects: Entrance, Emphasis, Exit, and Motion Path. In this 
example, I chose the Bounce entrance effect.
 
 The entrance effect you selected is added to the Animation pane, as 
shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 Note that each of the paragraphs in the text placeholder have been 
assigned the numbers 1 through 3 to indicate the sequence in which the 
paragraphs will be animated. In the Custom Animation pane, the anima-
tion that was added in Step 4 is given the single number 1; numbers 2 
and 3 don’t appear in the pane. That’s because although this animation 
is applied to three separate paragraphs, it is treated as a single anima-
tion in the Custom Animation pane.
 
 However, if you click the double down arrow beneath the animation, 
the three separate paragraph animations will be listed individually, as 
shown in Figure 10-7.

Animation 
pane after

graphs can

5. (Optional) Use the Effect Options control to select additional options 
for the effect.
 
 For example, if you choose a Fly In effect, you can use the Effect Options 
control to specify the direction from which you want the text to fly.
 
6. To preview the animation, click the Play button at the bottom of the 
Custom Animation task pane.
 
 Or, if you prefer, just run the slide show to see how the animation looks. 
If nothing happens, click the mouse button to start the animation.
If you add more than one effect to a slide, the effects are initiated one at a 
time by mouse clicks, in the order you create them. You can drag effects up 
or down in the custom animation list to change the order of the effects. For 
more information about changing the order or setting up automatic effects, 
see the “Timing your animations” section later in this chapter.
You can further tweak an effect by clicking the down arrow that appears next 
to the effect in the custom animation list and then choosing Effect Options. 
This brings up a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 10-8. This 
dialog box has settings that let you add a sound to the animation, change the 
color of the object after the animation completes, and specify how you want 
text animated (All at Once, One Word at a Time, or One Letter at a Time). 
Depending on the type of effect, additional controls might appear in this 
dialog box.

More about animating text
The most common reason for animating text is to draw attention to your text 
one paragraph at a time while you show your presentation. One way to do 
this is to create an entrance effect for the text placeholder and then adjust 
the effect settings so that the entrance effect is applied one paragraph at a 
time. When you do that, your slide initially appears empty except for the title. 
Click once, and the first paragraph appears. Talk about that paragraph for a 
while and then click again to bring up the second paragraph. You can keep 
talking and clicking until all the paragraphs have appeared. When you click 
again, PowerPoint calls up the next slide.
Another approach is to use an emphasis effect instead of an entrance effect. 
This sort of effect allows all the paragraphs to display initially on the slide. 
When you click the mouse, the emphasis effect is applied to the first para-
graph — it changes colors, increases in size, spins, whatever. Each time you 
click, the emphasis effect is applied to the next paragraph in sequence.
Either way, you must first add the effect for the text placeholder and then call 
up the Effect Settings dialog box by clicking the down arrow next to the effect 
in the custom animation list and then choosing Effect Settings. This summons 
the settings dialog box for the text object. Click the Text Animation tab to see 
the animation settings, shown in Figure 10-9.
The Group Text setting, found on the Text Animation tab of the animation 
settings dialog box, controls how paragraphs appear when you click the 
mouse during the show, based on the paragraph’s outline level. If you have 
only one outline level on the slide, grouping By 1st Level Paragraphs will do. 
If you have two or more levels, grouping text By 1st Level Paragraphs causes 
each paragraph to be animated along with any paragraphs that are subor-
dinate to it. If you’d rather animate the second-level paragraphs separately, 
group your text By 2nd Level Paragraphs instead.

130
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 10-9: 
Animating 
text.
 
The other controls on this tab let you animate each paragraph automati-
cally after a certain time interval or display the paragraphs in reverse order. 
(David Letterman, if you’re reading this, you can use this feature when you 
present your Top Ten lists.)
Timing your animations
Most animations are initiated by mouse clicks. However, you can set up sev-
eral animations to activate automatically — in sequence or all at the same 
time. To do so, you must use PowerPoint’s animation timing features.
The first trick to controlling animation timing is to get the effects listed in the 
custom animation list in the correct order. Effects are added to the list in the 
order you create them. If you plan carefully, you might be able to create the 
effects in the same order that you want to animate them. More likely, you’ll 
need to change the order of the effects. Fortunately, you can do that easily 
enough by dragging the effects up or down in the Custom Animation task 
pane.
After you get the effects in the right order, choose an option from the Start 
drop-down list that’s near the top of the Custom Animation task pane to set 
the Start setting for each effect. This setting has three options:
 
✓ Start On Click: Starts the effect when you click the mouse or press Enter
 
✓ Start With Previous: Starts the effect when the effect immediately above 
it starts
 
 Use this option to animate two or more objects simultaneously.
 
✓ Start After Previous: Starts the effect as soon as the preceding effect 
finishes

131
 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
Starting with the first effect in the list, click each effect to select it and then 
choose the Start setting for the effect. If all the effects except the first are set 
to With Previous or After Previous, the entire slide’s animations run automat-
ically after you start the first effect by clicking the mouse.
For example, Figure 10-10 shows a slide with three polygons drawn to resem-
ble pieces of a puzzle. You can animate this puzzle so that the three pieces 
come together at the same time.
 
If you want to find out how to draw the shapes that are animated in this illus-
tration, you can look ahead to Chapter 13.
Follow these steps to set up an animated puzzle like the one shown in Figure 
10-10:
 
1. Add a Fly In entrance effect for the top-left piece with the following 
settings:
 
• Start: On Click
 
• Direction: From Top-Left
 
• Duration: 2 Seconds
 
Figure 10-10:

132
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
2. Add a Fly In entrance effect for the top-right piece with the following 
settings:
 
• Start: With Previous
 
• Direction: From Top-Right
 
• Duration: 2 Seconds
 
3. Add a Fly In entrance effect for the bottom piece with the following 
settings:
 
• Start: With Previous
 
• Direction: From Bottom
 
• Duration: 2 Seconds
For even more control over an effect’s timings, click the down arrow to the 
right of the effect and then choose Timing. A dialog box similar to the one in 
Figure 10-11 appears. Here’s the lowdown on the timing settings:
 
✓ Start: This is the same as the Start setting in the Custom Animation task 
pane.
 
✓ Delay: This lets you delay the start of the animation by a specified 
number of seconds.
 
✓ Duration: This is the same as the Speed setting in the Custom Animation 
task pane.
 
✓ Repeat: This lets you repeat the effect so the object is animated several 
times in succession.
 
✓ Rewind When Done Playing: Certain effects leave the object in a dif-
ferent condition than the object was when you started. For example, 
the object might change color or size or move to a new position on the 
slide. If you select the Rewind When Done Playing option, the object is 
restored to its original condition when the animation finishes.

 Chapter 10: Animating Your Slides
Making Text Jiggle
One of my favorite cute little animations is to make text — especially a short 
heading — jiggle. Not a lot, but just a little. The effect works best if the text 
has a funny typeface, such as Cosmic or Jokerman. By using a very small 
motion path and setting the timing options to repeat until the end of the 
slide, you can make the text jiggle just a little bit the entire time the slide is 
onscreen:
 
1. Type the text that you want to jiggle and use the Font drop-down list 
to choose an appropriately silly typeface.
 
 Jokerman is a favorite font for jiggling text.
 
2. Use the Zoom control at the bottom-right corner of the screen to zoom 
in to 400%.
 
 You want to zoom way in so you can draw a very small motion path.
 
3. On the Animation tab, click Add Animation and then choose Custom 
Path from the Motion Paths section of the gallery. (You probably have 
to scroll the gallery to see this option.)
 
 The cursor changes to a little pencil.
 
4. Draw a tightly knit scribble pattern right in the center of the text.
 
 Just wiggle the pencil cursor back and forth and up and down in an area 
of just a few pixels. Go back and forth quite a few times to make the 
jiggle effect appear to be random.
 
5. Zoom back out to normal size.
 
6. In the Custom Animation task pane, click the arrow next to the anima-
tion you just created and then choose Timing.
 
 This brings up the dialog box that lets you set the timing options.
 
7. Change the speed to 2 seconds and the Repeat drop-down to Until End 
of Slide. Then click OK.
 
8. Run the slide show to check the effect.
You might have to try this several times before you get an effect you like, 
adjusting the random scribbles or the duration of the animation. Don’t be 
afraid to experiment!
Using the Animation Painter
One of the nice new features of PowerPoint 2010 is the Animation Painter, 
which makes it easy to copy a complete animation effect from one object to 
another. To use the Animation Painter, follow these steps:

134
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
1. Use the techniques presented throughout this chapter to apply an ani-
mation effect to one of the objects in your slide show.
 
2. Select the object you have animated.
 
3. In the Custom Animation group of the Animation Ribbon tab, click the 
Animation Painter button.
 
 The mouse pointer changes to a little paintbrush.
 
4. Click the object you want to apply the animation to.
 
 The animation that you created for the object selected in Step 2 is 
applied to the object you clicked on in this step.
 
If you want to apply the animation to more than one object, double-click the 
Animation Painter in Step 3. Then, you can repeat Step 4 as many times as you 
wish to copy the animation to multiple objects. When your animation frenzy 
has come to a close, press the Esc key.

W
ant to add a bit of text to every slide in your presentation? Or maybe 
add your name and phone number at the bottom of your audience 
handouts? Or place a picture of Rush Limbaugh at the extreme right side of 
each page of your speaker notes?
Masters are the surefire way to add something to every slide. No need to 
toil separately at each slide. Add something to the Master, and it shows up 
automatically on every slide. Remove it from the Master, and — poof! — it 
disappears from every slide. Very convenient.
Masters govern all aspects of a slide’s appearance: background color, objects 
that appear on every slide, text that appears on all slides, and more.
Working with Masters
In PowerPoint, a Master governs the appearance of all the slides or pages in a 
presentation. Each presentation has at least three Masters:
 
✓ Slide Master: Dictates the format of your slides
 
 You work with this Master most often when you tweak your slides to 
cosmetic perfection.

136
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
✓ Handout Master: Controls the look of printed handouts
 
✓ Notes Master: Determines the characteristics of printed speaker notes
Each Master specifies the appearance of text (font, size, and color, for 
example), slide background color, animation effects, and any additional text 
or other objects that you want to appear on each slide or page.
In addition, each Master can contain one or more layouts that provide 
different arrangements of text and other elements on the slide. For example, 
a typical Slide Master might contain a Title layout and several Text layouts 
for various types of body text slides.
One interesting — and often useful — aspect of Slide Masters is that any 
elements you add to the Master itself are also included in each layout that’s 
associated with the Master. For example, if you set the background color for 
the Slide Master, that color is used for each layout. Likewise, if you add a big 
blue rectangle in the top-left corner of the Slide Master, that rectangle is 
visible in the top-left corner of each layout.
However, you can also add elements to an individual layout. Then, the 
element is present only for that layout. For example, you may want to add 
more graphical elements to the Title layout. Then, those elements appear 
only on slides that use the Title layout.
Here are a few other points to ponder while you lie awake at night thinking 
about Slide Masters:
 
✓ Masters aren’t optional. Every presentation has them. You can, however, 
override the formatting of objects contained in the Master for a particular 
slide. This capability enables you to vary the appearance of slides when 
necessary.
 
✓ PowerPoint allows you to create more than one Slide Master in a 
single presentation, so you can mix two or more slide designs in your 
presentations. That’s why I say a presentation has at least three Masters. 
If you have more than one Slide Master, a presentation will have more 
than three Masters altogether. Note, however, that you can still have 
only one Handout or Notes Master in each presentation. For more 
information about using more than one Slide Master, see the section, 
“Yes, You Can Serve Two Masters,” at the end of this chapter.
 
✓ If you’ve used previous versions of PowerPoint, you might be wondering 
what happened to the Title Master. In the old days, there was actually a 
separate Master for title slides. However, in PowerPoint 2010, title slides 
don’t have their own Masters. Instead, the format of title slides is controlled 
by a Title Slide layout that belongs to a particular Slide Master.

Modifying the Slide Master
If you don’t like the layout of your slides, call up the Slide Master and do 
something about it, as shown in these steps:
 
1. Call up Slide Master View by opening the View tab on the Ribbon and 
then clicking the Slide Master button, found in the Presentation Views 
group.
 
 Alternatively, you can hold down the Shift key and then click the Normal 
View button near the bottom right of the screen.
 
2. Behold the Slide Master in all its splendor.
 
 Figure 11-1 shows a typical Slide Master. You can see the placeholders 
for the slide title and body text. Although none are visible in this example, 
the Master can also contain background colors and other elements that 
are present on each slide.
 
 The Slide Master includes placeholders for three objects that appear at 
the bottom of each slide: the Date area, Footer area, and Number area. 
These special areas are described later in this chapter under the heading, 
“Using Headers and Footers.”
 
 A thumbnail of each Slide Master as well as the layouts for each Master 
are shown on the left side of the screen.
 
3. Make any formatting changes that you want.
 
 Select the text you want to apply a new style to and make your format-
ting changes. If you want all the slide titles to be in italics, for example, 
select the title text and then press Ctrl+I or click the Italic button on the 
Formatting toolbar.
 
 Make sure the Slide Master itself is selected — not one of its layouts. 
That way, any changes you make apply to all the layouts associated with 
the Slide Master.
 
4. (Optional) To add elements that are specific to one of the layouts, 
select the layout and then add your changes.
 
 For example, you may want to add more graphical elements or select dif-
ferent fonts for your title slides. To do that, select the Title Slide layout 
and make your changes.
 
5. Click the Normal View button near the bottom right of the window to 
return to Normal View.
 
 You’re done!

Slide Sorter Outline
Slide Show
Notice that the body object contains paragraphs for five outline levels 
formatted with different point sizes, indentations, and bullet styles. If you 
want to change the way an outline level is formatted, this is the place to do so.
 
You can type all you want in the title or object area placeholders, but the text 
that you type doesn’t appear on the slides. The text that appears in these 
placeholders is provided only so that you can see the effect of the formatting 
changes you apply. (To insert text that appears on each slide, see the upcoming 
section, “Adding recurring text or other elements.”)
 
You can edit any other object on the Master by clicking it. Unlike the title and 
object area placeholders, any text that you type in other Slide Master objects 
appears exactly as you type it on each slide.

139
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
Working with the Slide Master 
and Edit Master tabs
When you switch to Slide Master View, an entirely new tab appears on the 
Ribbon. This new tab — appropriately called Slide Master — is shown in 
Figure 11-2.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The Slide 
Master tab.
 
Throughout this chapter, I show you how to use many of the controls on 
this tab. For now, here’s a quick overview of each group on this tab and the 
controls found in them:
 
✓ Edit Master: The controls in this group let you edit the Slide Master. You 
can use the Insert Slide Master button to create a new Slide Master, or 
you can use the Insert Layout button to add a new layout to an existing 
Master. You can also use the Delete and Rename buttons to delete or 
rename Masters or layouts. For information about the Preserve button, 
see the section “Preserving your masters,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Master Layout: The controls in this group let you edit a layout by adding 
or removing placeholders, the title, and footer elements.
 
✓ Edit Theme: The controls in this group let you apply a theme to a Master 
or a layout. For more information about themes, flip to Chapter 9.
 
✓ Background: The controls in this group let you set the background for a 
Master or a layout. Refer to Chapter 9 for more information.
 
✓ Page Setup: The control in this group lets you change the orientation for 
a page. (Unfortunately, PowerPoint doesn’t allow you to have Masters 
with different orientations in a single presentation. When you change the 
orientation of a Slide Master or a layout, the orientation of all Masters 
and layouts in the presentation is changed.)
 
✓ Close: This group contains a Close Master View button that returns you 
to Normal View.

140
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
Adding recurring text or other elements
To add recurring text to each slide, follow this procedure:
 
1. Call up the Slide Master (by clicking Slide Master in the Presentation 
Views group of the Views tab) if it’s not displayed already.
 
2. Add a text box to the Slide Master by selecting the Insert tab on the 
Ribbon and then clicking the Text Box button (found in the Text group).
 
 Click where you want to add the text.
 
3. Type the text that you want to appear on each slide.
 
 For example, Call 1-800-555-NERD today! Don’t delay! Operators are 
standing by!
 
4. Format the text however you want.
 
 For example, if you want bold, press Ctrl+B or click the Bold button on 
the Formatting toolbar. (See Chapter 8 for more on text formatting.)
 
5. Click the Normal View button to return to your presentation.
 
 Now’s the time to gloat over your work. Lasso some co-workers and 
show ’em how proud you are that you added some text that appears on 
each slide in your presentation.
You can add other types of objects to the Slide Master, too. You can add clip 
art, pictures, or even a video or sound clip. Anything that you can add to an 
individual slide can be added to the Slide Master.
After you place an object on the Slide Master, you can grab it with the mouse 
and move it or resize it in any way you want. The object appears in the same 
location and size on each slide.
To delete an object from the Slide Master, click it and press Delete. To delete 
a text object, you must first click the object and then click again on the object 
frame. Then press Delete.
Applying themes to your Masters
You can use the Edit Theme group in the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon to 
change the theme applied to a Slide Master. Note: All the layouts that belong 
to a given Master use the same theme. So, it doesn’t matter whether the Slide 
Master itself or one of its layouts is selected when you change the theme; 
either way, the entire Slide Master is changed.

141
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
To change the theme for a Slide Master, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose View➪Presentation Views➪Slide Master or Shift+click the 
Normal View button at the bottom right of the PowerPoint window to 
summon the Slide Master.
 
2. Use the Themes drop-down list on the Slide Master tab to select the 
theme you want to apply to the Slide Master.
 
3. (Optional) Use the Colors, Fonts, and Effects controls to modify the 
color scheme, fonts, and effects used for the theme.
 
 Treat yourself to a bag of Cheetos if it works the first time. If it doesn’t 
work, have a bag of Cheetos anyway. Then rub all that orange gunk 
that sticks to your fingers on the computer screen. That will apply the 
Cheetos Orange color scheme to your Slide Master — at least temporarily.
PowerPoint themes are hefty enough that I’ve devoted an entire chapter to 
them. Go to Chapter 9 if you need to know how they work.
 
If you want to adjust the slide background, use the Background Styles control. 
Chapter 9 walks you through this feature.
Adding new layouts
If you don’t like the standard layouts that come with PowerPoint’s built-in 
Slide Master, you can add a layout and customize it any way you want. To 
add your own layout, just follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master View by choosing View➪Presentation 
Views➪Slide Master or Shift+click the Normal View button near the 
bottom right of the window.
 
2. On the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon, click Insert Layout in the Edit 
Master group.
 
 A new, blank layout is inserted in the current Slide Master.
 
3. Use the Insert Placeholder drop-down list in the Master Layout group 
on the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon to insert whatever placeholders 
you want to add to the new layout.
 
 This control reveals a list of placeholder types you can insert. The 
options are Content, Text, Picture, Chart, Table, Diagram, Media, and 
Clip Art.
 
4. Play with the layout until you get it just right.

142
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
 You can move and resize the placeholders to your heart’s content, and 
you can apply any formatting or other options you want for the layout.
 
5. When you’re happy, click the Close button to switch back to Normal 
View.
Adjusting the Handout 
and Notes Masters
Like the Slide Master, the Handout and Notes Masters contain formatting 
information that’s applied automatically to your presentation. This section 
tells you how you can modify these Masters.
Changing the Handout Master
Follow these simple steps to change the Handout Master:
 
1. Choose View➪Presentation Views➪Handout Master or hold down the 
Shift key while clicking the Slide Sorter View button.
 
 The Handout Master rears its ugly head, as shown in Figure 11-3. Notice 
that it includes a special Handout Master tab on the Ribbon.
 
2. Mess around with it.
 
 The Handout Master shows the arrangement of handouts for slides 
printed two, three, four, six, or nine per page, plus the arrangement for 
printing outlines. You can switch among these different handout layouts 
by using the Slides-Per-Page control in the Page Setup group on the 
Handout Master tab.
 
 Unfortunately, you can’t move, resize, or delete the slide and outline 
placeholders that appear in the Handout Master. You can, however, add 
or change elements that you want to appear on each handout page, such 
as your name and phone number, a page number, and maybe a good 
lawyer joke.
 
3. Click the Close Master View button on the Handout Master tab on the 
Ribbon.
 
 PowerPoint returns to Normal View.
 
4. Print a handout to see whether your changes worked.
 
 Handout Master elements are invisible until you print them, so you 
should print at least one handout page to check your work.

143
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
 
Figure 11-3: 
The 
Handout 
Master.
 
When you print handout pages, the slides are formatted according to 
the Slide Master. You can’t change the appearance of the slides from the 
Handout Master.
Changing the Notes Master
Notes pages consist of a reduced image of the slide, plus any notes that you 
type to go along with the slide. For more information about creating and 
using notes pages, see Chapter 5.
When printed, notes pages are formatted according to the Notes Master. To 
change the Notes Master, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose View➪Presentation Views➪Notes Master.
 
 The Notes Master comes to life, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
2. Indulge yourself.
 
 The Notes Master contains two main placeholders — one for your notes 
and the other for the slide. You can move or change the size of either 

144
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
of these objects, and you can change the format of the text in the notes 
placeholder. You also can add or change elements that you want to 
appear on each handout page. Also notice the convenient placement of 
the header, footer, date, and page number blocks.
 
3. Click the Close Master View button.
 
 PowerPoint returns to Normal View.
 
4. Print your notes to see whether your changes worked.
 
At the very least, add page numbers to your speaker notes. That way, if you 
drop a stack of notes pages, you can use the page numbers to quickly sort 
them back into order.
If public speaking gives you severe stomach cramps, add the text “Just 
picture them naked” to the Notes Master. It works every time for me.
 
Figure 11-4: 
The Notes 
Master.
 

145
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
Using Masters
You don’t have to do anything special to apply the formats from a Master 
to your slide; all slides automatically pick up the Master format unless you 
specify otherwise. So this section really should be titled “Not Using Masters” 
because it talks about how to not use the formats provided by Masters.
Overriding the Master text style
To override the text style specified by a Slide Master, simply format the text 
however you want while you’re working in Normal View. The formatting 
changes you make apply only to the selected text. The Slide Masters aren’t 
affected.
 
The only way to change one of the Masters is to do it directly by switching to 
the appropriate Master View. Thus, any formatting changes you make while in 
Slide View affect only that slide.
 
If you change the layout or formatting of text elements on a slide (for example, 
if you move the title placeholder or change the title font) and then decide that 
you liked it better the way it was, you can quickly reapply the text style from 
the Slide Master. Right-click the slide in the Slide Preview pane (on the left 
side of the screen) and then choose Reset Slide from the menu that appears.
Hiding background objects
Slide Masters enable you to add background objects that appear on every 
slide in your presentation. You can, however, hide the background objects 
for selected slides. You can also change the background color or effect used 
for an individual slide. These steps show you how:
 
1. Display the slide that you want to show with a plain background.
 
2. Click the Design tab on the Ribbon and then select the Hide 
Background Graphics check box found in the Background group.

146
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Hiding background objects or changing the background color or effect applies 
only to the current slide. Other slides are unaffected.
If you want to remove some but not all the background objects from a single 
slide, try this trick:
 
1. Hide the background graphics from the slide.
 
 To hide a background object, choose Design➪Background➪Hide 
Background Objects.
 
2. Call up the Slide Master by choosing View➪Presentation Views➪Slide 
Master.
 
3. Hold down the Shift key and then click each of the background 
objects that you want to appear.
 
4. Press Ctrl+C to copy these objects to the Clipboard.
 
5. Return to Normal View by clicking the Normal button at the bottom of 
the screen.
 
6. Press Ctrl+V to paste the objects from the Clipboard.
 
7. Click the Design tab on the Ribbon and then click the Sent to Back 
button (in the Arrange group) if the background objects obscure other 
slide objects or text.
 
Note that if you paste objects in this way, those objects are no longer tied to 
the Slide Master. Thus, if you later change the objects on the Slide Master, the 
change won’t be reflected on the slides with the pasted copies of the objects.
Using Headers and Footers
Headers and footers provide a convenient way to place repeating text at the 
top or bottom of each slide, handout, or notes page. You can add the time 
and date, slide number or page number, or any other information that you 
want to appear on each slide or page, such as your name or the title of your 
presentation.
The PowerPoint Slide Masters include three placeholders for such information:
 
✓ The Date area can be used to display a date and time.
 
✓ The Number area can be used to display the slide number.
 
✓ The Footer area can be used to display any text that you want to see on 
each slide.

147
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
 
In addition, Handout and Notes Masters include a fourth placeholder, the 
Header area, which provides an additional area for text that you want to see 
on each page.
Although the Date, Number, and Footer areas normally appear at the bottom 
of the slide in the Slide Masters, you can move them to the top by switching 
to Slide View or Slide Master View and then dragging the placeholders to the 
top of the slide.
Adding a date, number, or footer to slides
To add a date, slide number, or footer to your slides, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Header and 
Footer button (found in the Text group).
 
 The Header and Footer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-5. 
(If necessary, click the Slide tab so that you see the slide footer options 
as shown in the figure.)
 
Figure 11-5: 
The Header 
and Footer 
dialog box.
 
 
2. To display the date, select the Date and Time check box. Then select 
the date format that you want in the list box beneath the Update 
Automatically radio button.
 
 Alternatively, you can select the Fixed radio button and then type any 
text that you want in the Fixed text box. The text that you type appears 
in the Date area of the Slide Master.
 
 If you’re the sort of bloke who begins a presentation with G’day mates!, 
you might want to change the Language and Calendar Type settings.

148
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
3. To display slide numbers, select the Slide Number check box.
 
4. To display a footer on each slide, select the Footer check box and then 
type the text that you want to appear on each slide in the Footer text box.
 
 For example, you may type your name, your company name, a subliminal 
message, or the name of your presentation.
 
5. If you want the date, number, and footer to appear on every slide 
except for the title slide, select the Don’t Show on Title Slide check box.
 
6. Click Apply to All.
 
If you’re going to give a presentation on a certain date in the future (for 
example, at a sales conference or a trade show), type the date that you’ll be 
giving the presentation directly into the Fixed text box. You can use the same 
technique to postdate presentations that you never really gave but need to 
supply to your legal counsel to back up your alibi. (You can also type any 
other type of text you want to appear here.)
If you want to change the Footer areas for just one slide, click Apply instead 
of Apply to All. This option comes in handy for those occasional slides that 
contain a graphic or a block of text that crowds up against the footer areas. 
You can easily suppress the footer information for that slide to make room 
for the large graphic or text.
Adding a header or footer to 
notes or handouts pages
To add header and footer information to notes or handouts pages, follow the 
steps described in the preceding section, “Adding a date, number, or footer 
to slides,” except click the Notes and Handouts tab after the Header and 
Footer dialog box appears. Clicking this tab displays a dialog box that’s simi-
lar to the Header and Footer dialog box for Slide, except that it gives you an 
additional option to add a header that appears at the top of each page. After 
you indicate how you want to print the Date, Header, Number, and Footer 
areas, click the Apply to All button.
Editing the header and footer 
placeholders directly
If you want, you can edit the text that appears in the header and footer 
placeholders directly. First, display the appropriate Master — Slide, Handout, 
or Notes. Then click the date, number, footer, or header placeholder and 
start typing.

149
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
You may notice that the placeholders include special codes for the options 
that you indicated in the Header and Footer dialog box. For example, the date 
placeholder may contain the text <date,time> if you indicated that the date 
should be displayed. You can type text before or after these codes, but you 
should leave the codes themselves alone.
Yes, You Can Serve Two Masters
In spite of the Biblical edict, Microsoft has endowed PowerPoint with the 
ability to have more than one Slide Master. This feature lets you set up two 
or more Slide Masters and then choose which Master you want to use for 
each slide in your presentation.
The following sections explain how to use the multiple Masters feature.
Creating a new Slide Master
To add a new Master to a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master View.
 
 From the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Slide Master button (found 
in the Presentation Views group). Or if you prefer, hold down the Shift 
key and click the Normal View button near the lower-right corner of the 
screen.
 
2. In the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon, click the Insert Slide Master 
button in the Edit Master group.
 
 A new Slide Master appears, as shown in Figure 11-6. Notice that a 
thumbnail for the new Slide Master is added to the list of thumbnails 
on the left side of the screen, and that the new Slide Master uses 
PowerPoint’s default settings (white background, black text, and so 
forth).
 
3. Modify the new Slide Master to your liking.
 
 You can make any formatting changes you want: Change the background 
color and text styles, add background objects, and so on.
 
4. Click the Close Master View button on the Slide Master tab on the 
Ribbon to return to Normal View.
 
 You can now begin using the new Master that you created. (See the 
section, “Applying Masters,” later in this chapter for more information.)

150
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 11-6: 
Creating a 
new Slide 
Master.
 
 
Another way to create a new Slide Master is to duplicate one of your 
presentation’s existing Slide Masters. When you do that, the new Slide Master 
inherits the formatting of the original one. This inheritance can save you a lot 
of work, especially if you want to create a new Slide Master that varies from an 
existing one in only a minor way, such as having a different background color.
To duplicate a Slide Master, click the Master that you want to duplicate in the 
thumbnails on the left of the screen and then press Ctrl+D.
To delete a Slide Master, click the Master that you want to delete. Then click 
the Delete Master button in the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon (located in 
the Edit Master group). Or, just press Delete.
Applying Masters
If you have created multiple Masters for a presentation, you can select which 
Master to use for each slide in your presentation. To apply a Master to one or 
more slides, follow these steps:

151
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
 
1. Select the slide or slides to which you want to apply the alternate 
Slide Master.
 
 The easiest way to do this is to click the slide that you want in the 
thumbnails area on the left of the screen. To select more than one slide, 
hold down the Ctrl key and click each slide that you want to select.
 
2. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon and then click the Layout button (in 
the Slides group).
 
 This action summons the gallery, shown in Figure 11-7. Here, you can 
see all the layouts for all the Slide Masters contained in the presentation.
 
Figure 11-7: 
Choosing a 
layout.
 
 
3. Select the Slide Master layout you want to apply to the slides you 
selected.
 
 The Slide Master is applied to the selected slides.
Preserving your masters
PowerPoint has a bad habit of deleting Slide Masters when they’re no longer 
used in your presentation. For example, if you create a new Slide Master and 
then apply it to all the slides in your presentation, PowerPoint assumes that 
you no longer need the original Slide Master. So, the original is deleted. Poof! 
Your presentation is now one pickle short of a full jar.

152
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
You can prevent this from happening with the Preserve Master option for 
your Slide Masters. Any new Slide Masters that you create automatically get 
the Preserve Master option, so they won’t be deleted. However, the Slide 
Masters that your presentations start off with don’t have the Preserve Master 
option, so you may want to set it yourself.
To preserve a Master, switch to Slide Master view, click the thumbnail for 
the Master that you want to preserve, and then click the Preserve button on 
the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon (found in the Edit Master group). A little 
pushpin icon appears next to the Master’s thumbnail to show that the Master 
will be preserved.
 
Don’t click the Preserve button indiscriminately! If you click it for a Master 
that already has the Preserve Master setting, Preserve Master is removed for 
that Master. Then the Master is subject to premature deletion.
Restoring Lost Placeholders
If you’ve played around with your Masters too much, you may inadvertently 
delete a layout placeholder that you wish you could get back. For example, 
suppose that you delete the footer placeholder from a Master and now you 
want it back. No problem! Just follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master View.
 
2. Call up the Master with the missing placeholder.
 
3. In the Slide Master tab on the Ribbon, click the Master Layout button 
(in the Master Layout group).
 
 This calls up the Master Layout dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-8.
 
Figure 11-8: 
The Master 
Layout dia-
log box.
 
 
 The Master Layout dialog box is one of the strangest dialog boxes you 
encounter. If you summon it for a Master that still has all its placehold-
ers, all the check boxes on the Master Layout dialog box are grayed out. 
So, all you can do is look at the controls, grunt, scratch your head, and 
then click OK to dismiss the seemingly useless dialog box. However, 
if you have deleted one or more placeholders, the check boxes for the 
missing placeholders are available.

153
 Chapter 11: Masters of the Universe Meet the Templates of Doom
 
4. Select the check boxes for the placeholders that you want to restore.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The missing placeholders reappear.
 
Note that the preceding procedure works only for actual masters, not for 
individual layouts. If you delete a placeholder from a layout, you must re-
create it by using the Insert Placeholder command as described in the section 
“Adding new layouts,” earlier in this chapter.
Working with Templates
If you had to create every presentation from scratch, starting with a blank 
slide, you would probably put PowerPoint back in its box and use it as a 
bookend. Creating a presentation is easy, but creating one that looks good 
is a different story. Making a good-looking presentation is tough even for the 
artistically inclined. For left-brained, nonartistic types, it’s next to impossible.
 
Thank heavens for themes and templates. A theme is simply a PowerPoint 
presentation with predefined Slide Masters. A template is similar to a theme, 
but also includes boilerplate text. Because they are so similar, I’ll refer to both 
themes and templates simply as templates throughout the rest of this section.
Templates jump-start the process of creating good-looking presentations. You 
can create your own templates, but fortunately PowerPoint comes with a ton 
of them designed by professional artists who understand color combinations, 
balance, and all that other artsy stuff. Have a croissant and celebrate.
Templates use the special file extension .potx, but you can also use ordinary 
PowerPoint presentation files (PPT) as themes or templates. You can, 
therefore, use any of your own presentations as a template. If you make 
extensive changes to a presentation’s Masters, you can use that presentation 
as a template for other presentations that you create. Or, you can save the 
presentation as a template by using the .potx file extension.
 
Because a template is a presentation, you can open it and change it if you want.
Creating a presentation 
based on a template
To create a new presentation based on a template, choose New from the 
Office menu to summon the New Presentation dialog box. Then, click 
Installed Templates in the Template Categories list to display a list of the 
templates that come with PowerPoint. See Figure 11-9.

154
Part II: Creating Great-Looking Slides 
 
Figure 11-9: 
The New 
Presentation 
dialog box.
 
To create a presentation based on one of these templates, simply click the 
template to select it and then click the Create button.
Another way to create a new presentation via a template is to click one of the 
categories listed under Microsoft Office Online. Then, you’re presented with 
a frequently changing set of templates that are available for download from 
Microsoft’s Office Web site.
Creating a new template
If none of the templates that come with PowerPoint appeals to you, you can 
easily create your own. All you have to do is create a presentation with the 
Masters and the color scheme set up just the way you want and then save it 
as a template. Here are a few points to remember about templates:
 
✓ If you want to make minor modifications to one of the supplied templates, 
open the template via the Open command. Then, make your changes 
and use the Save As command to save the template under a new name.

155

✓ You can also create your own presentation templates. Just create the 
template as a normal presentation and add however many slides that 
you want to include.
Working with Presentation Sections
Sections are a new feature of PowerPoint 2010 that let you divide a presentation 
into two or more groups of slides called sections. Sections are designed to be 
used with large presentations that contain a large number of slides that can 
easily be grouped into logical groupings.
Using the Sections feature in PowerPoint 2010 couldn’t be easier. To create a 
new section in your presentation, just select the first slide that you want 
in the new section, switch to the Home tab, click the Section button (found in 
the Slides group), and then choose Add Section. The new section appears in 
the Slide thumbnail area with the name Untitled Section, as shown in 
Figure 11-10.
After you’ve created one or more sections in your presentation, you can do 
several interesting things with the sections:
 
✓ You can select all of the slides in a section by clicking the section header 
in the Slide Thumbnail pane.
 
✓ You can collapse or expand the sections in the Slide Thumbnail pane by 
clicking the arrow at the left of the section header.
 
✓ You can rename a section by right-clicking the section header and 
choosing Rename Section.
 
✓ You can move all the slides in a section by dragging the section header 
to a new location in the Slide Thumbnail pane.
 
✓ You can delete the slides in a section, as well as the section itself, by 
clicking the section header to select the section and then pressing the 
Delete key.
 
✓ You can remove a section without deleting its slides by right-clicking the 
section header and choosing Remove Section.
 
✓ During a slide show, you can go to the first slide in any selection by 
clicking the Menu icon in the bottom-left corner of the slide, then 
choosing Go To Section and selecting the section you want to go to.

ace it: Most of us weren’t born with even an ounce of artistic ability. 
Some day (soon, hopefully), the genetic researchers combing through 
the billions and billions of genes strung out on those twisty DNA helixes will 
discover the Artist Gene. Then, in spite of protests from the da Vincis, 
Van Goghs, and Monets among us (who fear that their NEA grants will be 
threatened), doctors will splice the little gene into our DNA strands so that 
we can all be artists. Of course, this procedure won’t be without its side 
effects: Some will develop an insatiable craving for croissants, and others will 
inexplicably develop French accents and whack off their ears. But artists we 
shall be.
Until then, we have to rely on clip art, pictures we’ve found on the Internet, 
or pictures that we scanned into the computer with a scanner or took with a 
digital camera.
In this chapter, you find out about the different types of computer pictures 
and how you can insert them into a PowerPoint slide. Then, after you get 
your pictures into PowerPoint, you discover how you can fiddle with them to 
get them to look better.

Exploring the Many Types of Pictures
The world is awash with many different picture file formats. Fortunately, 
PowerPoint works with almost all these formats. The following sections 
describe the two basic types of pictures that you can work with in 
PowerPoint: bitmap pictures and vector drawings.
Bitmap pictures
A bitmap picture is a collection of small dots that compose an image. Bitmap 
pictures are most often used for photographs and for icons and other 
buttons used on Web pages. You can create your own bitmap pictures with 
a scanner, a digital camera, or a picture-drawing program such as Adobe 
Photoshop. You can even create crude bitmap pictures with Microsoft Paint, 
which is the free painting program that comes with Windows.
The dots that make up a bitmap picture are called pixels. The number of 
pixels in a given picture depends on two factors: the picture’s resolution and 
its size. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per inch. A typical computer 
monitor displays 72 pixels per inch, though many monitors can display at 
higher resolutions. At 72 pixels per inch, a 1-inch square picture requires 
5,184 pixels (72 x 72). Photographs that will be printed on an inkjet or laser 
printer usually have a much higher resolution, often 300 pixels per inch or 
more. At 300 pixels per inch, a 4-x-6-inch photograph requires more than two 
million pixels.
The amount of color information stored for the picture — also referred to as 
the picture’s color depth — affects how many bytes of computer memory the 
picture requires. The color depth determines how many different colors the 
picture can contain. Most pictures have one of two color depths: 256 colors 
or 16.7 million colors. Most simple charts, diagrams, cartoons, and other 
types of clip art look fine at 256 colors. Photographs usually use 16.7 million 
colors.
 
Pictures with 16.7 million colors are also known as TrueColor pictures or 24-bit 
color pictures.
A 4-x-6-inch photograph, which has more than 2 million pixels, requires about 
2MB to store with 256 colors. With TrueColor, the size of the picture jumps to 
a whopping 6.4MB. Fortunately, bitmap pictures can be compressed to reduce 
their size without noticeably distorting the image. Depending on the actual 
contents of the picture, a 6MB picture might be reduced to 250KB or less.
Bitmap picture files usually have filename extensions such as .bmp, .gif, 
.jpg, .png, or .pcx. Table 12-1 lists the bitmap file formats that PowerPoint 
supports.

161
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
 
If you have a choice in the matter, I recommend you use JPEG format images 
for photographs that you want to include in PowerPoint presentations 
because JPEG’s built-in compression saves hard drive space.

Victor, give me a vector
Besides bitmap pictures, you can also use vector drawing with PowerPoint. 
A vector drawing is a picture file that contains a detailed definition of each 
shape that makes up the image. Vector drawings are usually created with 
high-powered drawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator.
PowerPoint supports all the most popular vector drawing formats, as 
described in Table 12-2.

Using Clip Art
Are you sitting down? Whether you buy PowerPoint by itself or get it as a part 
of Microsoft Office, you also get a collection of thousands of pictures, sound 
clips, and motion clips that you can pop directly into your presentations.
PowerPoint lets you access clip art through a special Clip Art task pane that 
lets you search for clip art by keyword. The Clip Art task pane makes it easy 
to find just the right picture to embellish your presentation.
The first time you access the clip art, a dialog box appears, offering to 
search your entire hard drive and create a catalog of all the pictures it 
contains. I suggest you accept this offer so that you can use it to access your 
own picture files in addition to the clip art files that come with PowerPoint.
In addition to pictures, PowerPoint can work sound and video clips. For more 
information about using sound and video, see Chapter 16.
 
Don’t overdo the pictures. One surefire way to guarantee an amateurish look 
to your presentation is to load it down with three clip art pictures on every 
slide that all chime or go zip or boing. Judicious use is much more effective.
Dropping in some clip art
The following steps explain how to drop clip art into your presentation:
 
1. Move to the slide on which you want to plaster the clip art.
 
 If you want the same clip art picture to appear on every slide, move to 
Slide Master View.

163
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
 
2. On the Ribbon, choose Insert➪Illustrations➪Clip Art.
 
 After a brief moment’s hesitation, the Clip Art task pane pops up in all 
its splendor, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
3. Type a keyword in the Search For text box and then click the Go 
button.
 
 For example, to search for pictures of trombones, type Trombone in the 
Search For text box and then click Go.
 
 PowerPoint searches through the Clip Organizer to locate the clip art 
you’re looking for, and then it displays thumbnails of the pictures it 
finds in the Clip Art task pane.
 
 PowerPoint may ask you whether you want to search through its vast 
online collection of clip art in addition to clip art that’s already on your 
computer. I recommend you click Yes if this question appears, unless 
you’re working without an Internet connection.
 
4. Click the picture that you want to use.
 
 The picture is inserted on the current slide, as shown in Figure 12-2. 
Notice that a special Picture Tools tab with tools for working with pictures 
has appeared. This Picture Tools tab appears whenever you select a 
picture object.

The Clip Art 
task pane.
 

164
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 12-2: 
PowerPoint

picture on 
the slide.
 
 
5. If you’re finished inserting pictures, click the Clip Art task pane’s 
Close button (the X in the upper-right corner of the task pane).
 
 The task pane vanishes.
You’ll probably want to move the picture and change its size. To find out 
how, see the following section.
Moving, sizing, and stretching clip art
Because PowerPoint chooses an arbitrary position on the slide to insert clip 
art, you undoubtedly want to move the clip art to a more convenient location. 
You probably also want to change the size of the clip art if it’s too big or too 
small for your slide.
Follow these steps to force your inserted clip art into full compliance:
 
1. Click the picture and drag it wherever you want.

165
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
 
 You don’t have to worry about clicking exactly the edge of the picture or 
one of its lines; just click anywhere in the picture and drag it around.
 
2. Notice the eight handles. Drag one of them to resize the picture.
 
 You can click and drag any of these handles to adjust the size of the 
picture. When you click one of the corner handles, you can change the 
height and width of the picture at the same time. When you drag one of 
the edge handles (top, bottom, left, or right) to change the size of the 
picture in just one dimension, you distort the picture’s outlook as you go.
 
When you resize a picture, the picture changes its position on the slide. As 
a result, you can count on moving it after you resize it. If you hold down the 
Ctrl key while dragging a handle, however, the picture becomes anchored at 
its center point as you resize it. Therefore, its position is unchanged, and you 
probably don’t have to move it.
Stretching a clip art picture by dragging one of the edge handles can 
dramatically change the picture’s appearance. For example, you can stretch 
an object vertically to make it look tall and thin or horizontally to make it 
look short and fat.
Inserting Pictures from a File
If you happen to already have an image file on your computer that you want 
to insert into a presentation, PowerPoint lets you insert the file. These steps 
show you how:
 
1. Move to the slide on which you want to splash a picture.
 
2. Open the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Picture button in 
the Illustrations group.
 
 This step summons the Insert Picture dialog box, shown in Figure 12-3.
 
3. Dig through the bottom of your hard drive until you find the file that 
you want.
 
 The picture you want might be anywhere. Fortunately, the Insert Picture 
dialog box has all the controls you need to search high and low until 
you find the file. Just click the icons at the left side of the box and you’re 
halfway there.
 
4. Click the file and then click Insert.
 
 You’re done! Figure 12-4 shows how a picture appears when it has been 
inserted on a slide.

Picture 
dialog box.
 
 
Figure 12-4: 
Stay, girl. 
Good girl!
 
As you can see in Figure 12-4, PowerPoint scales your pictures so they fill as 
much of the slide as possible. You need to resize the picture if you want it to 
be smaller. Just select the picture and then drag one of the size handles in 
the corner of the picture.

167
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
 
You also can paste a picture directly into PowerPoint by way of the Clipboard. 
Anything that you can copy to the Clipboard can be pasted into PowerPoint. 
For example, you can doodle a sketch in Paintbrush, copy it, and then zap 
over to PowerPoint and paste it. Voilà — instant picture!
Cropping a Picture
Sometimes you want to cut off the edges of a picture so that you can include 
just part of the picture in your presentation. For example, you might have a 
picture of two people, only one of whom you like. You can use PowerPoint’s 
cropping feature to cut off the other person. (Note that you can crop bitmap 
images, but not vector pictures.)
To crop a picture, select the picture and click the Crop button located near 
the right side of the Format tab on the Ribbon, in the group labeled Size. The 
selection handles change to special crop marks. You can then drag the crop 
marks around to cut off part of the picture. When you’re satisfied, press the 
Escape key. Figure 12-5 shows the picture that was inserted in Figure 12-4 
after it has been cropped and resized.
 
Figure 12-5:
A picture 
that has 
been 
cropped.
 

168
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
If you decide later that you don’t like the cropping, you can right-click the 
picture and choose Format Picture from the menu that appears. Then click the 
Reset button.
 
When you crop a picture, the picture still retains a basic rectangular shape. If 
you prefer to remove the background from an irregular shape in the picture, 
refer to the section “Removing Picture Backgrounds” later in this chapter.
Adding Style to Your Pictures
PowerPoint enables you to draw attention to your pictures by adding stylistic 
features such as borders, shadows, and reflections. Figure 12-6 shows a slide 
with several copies of a picture, each with a different style applied.
To add a style effect to a picture, select the picture and open the Picture 
Tools tab on the Ribbon. Then, simply select the picture style you want to 
apply.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Pictures 
with style.
 

169
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
PowerPoint comes with 28 predefined picture styles, shown in the gallery 
pictured in Figure 12-7. Each of these styles is simply a combination of three 
types of formatting you can apply to pictures: Shape, Border, and Effects. If 
you want, you can apply these formats individually as described in the fol-
lowing sections.
Note that if you use one of these predefined picture styles, the picture will 
be updated automatically if you later change the presentation’s theme. As a 
result, you should use one of the predefined styles whenever possible.
 
Figure 12-7: 
The Picture

Applying a picture border
You can apply a border to a picture by choosing Format➪Picture Styles➪
Picture Border on the Ribbon. This reveals the Picture Border menu, which 
lets you choose the border color, weight (the width of the border lines), and 
the pattern of dashes you want to use.
Note that if you have applied a shape to the picture, the border is applied to 
the shape.
Applying picture effects
The Picture Effects button in the Picture Styles group (located on the Format 
tab) lets you apply several interesting types of effects to your pictures. When 
you click this button, a menu with the following effect options is displayed:

170
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Shadow: Applies a shadow to the picture. You can select one of several 
predefined shadow effects or call up a dialog box that lets you customize 
the shadow.
 
✓ Reflection: Creates a reflected image of the picture beneath the original 
picture.
 
✓ Glow: Adds a glowing effect around the edges of the picture.
 
✓ Soft Edges: Softens the edges of the picture.
 
✓ Bevel: Creates a 3-D beveled look.
 
✓ 3-D Rotation: Rotates the picture in a way that creates a three-dimensional 
effect.
 
The best way to figure out how to use these effects is to experiment with them 
to see how they work.
Correcting Sharpness, Brightness, 
and Contrast
Sometimes, in spite of your best efforts, your pictures just don’t come out 
quite right. They may be too bright or too dim, faded or too contrasty, or a 
bit out of focus.
PowerPoint’s new Corrections command can help you out in those situations. 
This command, found on the Picture Tools Format tab, lets you adjust a 
picture’s sharpness, brightness, and contrast.
To change a picture’s sharpness, contrast, or brightness, click the 
Corrections button and choose one of the preset options from the gallery of 
choices that appears. Or, choose the Picture Correction Options command 
from the bottom of the Corrections menu to reveal the dialog box shown in 
Figure 12-8, which lets you individually control the sharpness, brightness, 
and contrast adjustments.

171

options.
 
Adjusting Color
The Color button on the Picture Tools Format tab lets you adjust the color of 
your pictures. You can adjust the following aspects of a picture’s color:
 
✓ Saturation: Controls the overall amount of color in the picture
 
✓ Tone: Controls the overall “warmth” of the picture’s color
 
✓ Recolor: Lets you change the primary color visible in the picture
To change a picture’s color, click the Color button on the Picture Tools 
Format tab and choose one of the options from the gallery of preset choices. 
Or, choose the Picture Color Options command at the bottom of the Color 
menu. This brings up the dialog box shown in Figure 12-9. You can then 
adjust the color settings to your liking.

172

options for a

Applying Artistic Effects
The Artistic Effects command applies one of several special filters to your 
picture in an effort to make the picture look like it was created by an artist 
rather than photographed with a $60 digital camera. Depending on the nature 
of the original picture, the results may or may not be convincing; the only 
way to find out is to try.
Here is a list of the artistic effects that are available on the Artistic Effects 
button:
 
✓ Marker
 
✓ Pencil Grayscale
 
✓ Pencil Sketch
 
✓ Line Drawing
 
✓ Chalk Sketch
 
✓ Paint Strokes
 
✓ Paint Brush
 
✓ Glow Diffused
 
✓ Blur
 
✓ Light Screen
 
✓ Watercolor Sponge
 
✓ Film Grain
 
✓ Mosaic Bubbles

173
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
 
✓ Glass
 
✓ Cement
 
✓ Texturizer
 
✓ Crisscross Etching
 
✓ Pastels Smooth
 
✓ Plastic Wrap
 
✓ Cutout
 
✓ Photocopy
 
✓ Glow Edges
To apply one of these effects, simply double-click the picture, click the 
Artistic Effects button on the Picture Tools Format tab, and choose the effect 
you want from the gallery.
To give you an idea of what these effects can accomplish, Figure 12-10 shows 
how the photograph originally shown in Figure 12-5 appears with the Pencil 
Sketch, Paint Strokes, and Plastic Wrap filters applied.

Compressing Your Pictures
Adding pictures to your slide show can dramatically increase the size of 
your presentation’s file on disk. This is especially true if you insert a bunch 
of pictures taken with a modern digital camera. For example, pictures taken 
with digital cameras are often half a megabyte or more each. Insert 50 such 
pictures into your slide show and the file will grow accordingly.
However, it turns out that the amount of detail contained in your average 
digital photograph is mostly wasted in a PowerPoint slide show. That’s 
because digital cameras are designed to create pictures that can be printed 
on high resolution printers. However, most computer monitors (and projectors) 
have a much lower resolution.

174
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
To compensate for this, PowerPoint includes a Compress Pictures command 
that can eliminate the extraneous detail in your images and thereby reduce 
the size of your presentation files. To save even more space, the Compress 
Pictures command also removes any parts of your pictures that have been 
cropped.
You can use this command to compress just a single picture or to compress 
all the pictures in your presentation at once. I recommend that you compress 
all of your pictures by following these steps:
 
1. Double-click any picture in the presentation to bring up the Picture 
Tools Format tab.
 
 The dialog box shown in Figure 12-11 appears.
 
Figure 12-11: 
Compressing 
pictures.
 
 
2. Uncheck the Apply Only to This Picture option.
 
 If you leave this option checked, only the selected picture will be 
compressed. Uncheck this option to compress all the pictures in the 
presentation.
 
3. Select Screen for the Target Output option.
 
 This step sets the compression so that image quality will still be good 
when the pictures are displayed on a computer screen or projector.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The images are compressed. Note that if you have a lot of pictures in 
your presentation, this step may take a few moments.
 
5. Save your presentation.
 
 The images won’t actually be compressed in the presentation file until 
you save the file.

175
 Chapter 12: Inserting Pictures and Clip Art
Removing Picture Backgrounds
One final bit of picture editing wizardry provided by PowerPoint 2010 is the 
ability to remove the background from a picture. For example, Figure 12-12 
shows a picture of my dog Lucy with the background removed.
To accomplish this bit of photo-editing magic, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the picture whose background you want to remove.
 
2. Click the Remove Background button in the Picture Tools Format tab.
 
 When you do, PowerPoint attempts to determine which part of your 
picture is the subject of the picture and which part is the background. 
The background is then displayed in purple. In addition, a special 
Background Removal tab appears on the Ribbon. See Figure 12-13.
 
Figure 12-12: 
Lucy with 
the back-
ground 
removed.
 

176
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 12-13: 
Removing 
the back-
ground.
 
 
3. Use the Mark Areas to Keep and Mark Areas to Remove buttons to 
refine the location of the picture’s background.
 
 For example, if an area that’s part of the subject is shown as back-
ground, click the Mark Areas to Keep button. Then, either click in the 
area you want included or click and drag a line across a large portion of 
the area to be included. PowerPoint will attempt to discern which part 
of the picture you mark and include that area in the picture’s subject.
 
 Similarly, if PowerPoint has mistaken part of the background for the 
subject, click the Mark Areas to Remove button and click or draw a line 
within the area that should be removed.
 
 If PowerPoint misinterprets your mark, press Ctrl+Z to undo your action. 
Or, click the Delete Mark button and then click the mark you want to 
delete.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until you’ve successfully removed the picture’s 
background.
 
5. Click the Keep Changes button.
 
 The slide returns to normal, with the background of your picture 
removed.

You’re going to cut out some simple shapes and paste them on your 
PowerPoint slides so that people either think that you’re a wonderful artist or 
scoff at you for not using clip art.
This chapter covers the drawing features of PowerPoint 2010. One of the 
best things about PowerPoint is the cool drawing tools. Once upon a time, 
PowerPoint had but rudimentary drawing tools — the equivalent of a box of 
crayons — but PowerPoint now has powerful drawing tools that are sufficient 
for all but the most sophisticated aspiring artists.
Some General Drawing Tips
Before getting into the specifics of using each PowerPoint drawing tool, the 
following sections describe a handful of general tips for drawing pictures.

178
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
Zooming in
When you work with the PowerPoint drawing tools, you might want to 
increase the zoom factor so that you can draw more accurately. I often work 
at 200, 300, or even 400 percent when I’m drawing. To change the zoom 
factor, use the zoom slider located in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 
Before you change the zoom factor to edit an object, select the object that you 
want to edit. This way, PowerPoint zooms in on that area of the slide. If you 
don’t select an object before you zoom in, you might need to scroll around to 
find the right location.
Displaying the ruler, gridlines, and guides
PowerPoint provides three onscreen features that can help you line up your 
drawings:
 
✓ Ruler: Horizontal and vertical rulers appear at the top of and to the left 
of the slide.
 
✓ Gridlines: A grid of evenly spaced dots appears directly on the slide.
 
✓ Guides: A pair of horizontal and vertical lines intersect on your slide like 
crosshairs in a target.
You can activate any or all of these features by clicking the View tab on the 
Ribbon and selecting the Ruler, Gridlines, or Guides check box. Figure 13-1 
shows PowerPoint with the rulers, gridlines, and guides displayed.
When you work with drawing objects, the ruler is positioned so that zero is 
at the middle of the slide. When you edit a text object, the ruler changes to a 
text ruler that measures from the margins and indicates tab positions.
For more information about using the gridlines or guides, see the section 
“Using the grids and guides” later in this chapter.
Sticking to the color scheme
You can assign individual colors to each object that you draw, but the 
purpose of the PowerPoint color schemes (described in Chapter 9) is to 
talk you out of doing that. If possible, let solid objects default to the color 
scheme’s fill color, or, if you must change the fill color, change it to one of 
the alternative colors provided by the scheme. The beauty of doing this is 
that if you change the color scheme later, the fill color for objects changes to 
reflect the new fill color. After you switch to a color that’s not in the theme, 
however, the object ignores any subsequent changes to the theme.

179

Saving frequently
Drawing is tedious work. You don’t want to spend two hours working on a 
particularly important drawing only to lose it all just because a comet strikes 
your building or an errant Scud lands in your backyard. You can prevent 
catastrophic loss from incidents such as these by pressing Ctrl+S or by 
frequently clicking the Save button as you work. And always wear protective 
eyewear.
Don’t forget Ctrl+Z
 
In my opinion, Ctrl+Z — the ubiquitous Undo command — is the most important 
keyboard shortcut in any Windows program, and PowerPoint is no exception. 
Remember that you’re never more than one keystroke away from erasing a 
boo-boo. If you do something silly — like forgetting to group a complex 
picture before trying to move it — you can always press Ctrl+Z to undo your 
last action. Ctrl+Z is my favorite and most frequently used PowerPoint key 
combination. (For left-handed mouse users, Alt+Backspace does the same 
thing.) And if you aren’t ready to climb on a chair shrieking at the first sign of 
a mouse, try clicking the handy Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar.

Drawing Simple Objects
To draw an object on a slide, first call up the Insert tab on the Ribbon. Then 
click the Shapes button (located in the Illustrations group) to reveal a gallery 
of shapes you can choose from, as shown in Figure 13-2. Finally, select the 
shape you want to draw from the Shapes gallery, shown in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-2: 
The Shapes 
gallery.
 
You find detailed instructions for drawing with the more important tools in 
the following sections. Before I get to that, though, I want to give you some 
pointers to keep in mind:
 
✓ Choosing a location: Before you draw an object, move to the slide on 
which you want to draw the object. If you want the object to appear on 
every slide in the presentation, display the Slide Master by choosing 
View➪Presentation Views➪Slide Master or by Shift+clicking the 
Normal View button.
 
✓ Fixing a mistake: If you make a mistake while drawing a shape, the Undo 
command on the Quick Access Toolbar can usually correct the mistake 
for you.

181
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
 
✓ Holding down the Shift key: If you hold down the Shift key while 
drawing a shape, PowerPoint forces the shape to be “regular.” That is, 
rectangles are squares, ellipses are circles, and lines are constrained to 
horizontal or vertical, or 45-degree diagonals.
Drawing straight lines
You can use the Line button to draw straight lines on your slides. Here’s the 
procedure:
 
1. Click the Line button in the Shapes group on the Insert tab.
 
2. Point the cursor to where you want the line to start.
 
3. Click and drag the cursor to where you want the line to end.
 
4. Release the mouse button when you reach your destination.
After you’ve drawn the shape, the Ribbon displays the Drawing Tools tab, as 
shown in Figure 13-3. You can then use the controls in the Shape Styles group 
to change the fill, outline, and effects applied to the line.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The 
Drawing 
Tools tab.
 
 
After you’ve drawn a line, you can adjust it by clicking it and then dragging the 
handles that appear on each end of the line.
Remember that you can force a line to be perfectly horizontal or vertical by 
holding down the Shift key while you draw. If you hold the Shift key and drag 
diagonally while you draw the line, the line will be constrained to perfect 
45-degree angles.
Drawing rectangles, squares, 
ovals, and circles
To draw a rectangle, follow these steps:

182
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
1. On the Insert tab, click the Shape buttons (in the Illustrations group), 
then click the Rectangle button.
 
2. Point the cursor to where you want one corner of the rectangle to be 
positioned.
 
3. Click and drag to where you want the opposite corner of the rectangle 
to be positioned.
 
4. Release the mouse button.
The steps for drawing an oval are the same as the steps for drawing a rectangle 
except that you click the Oval button rather than the Rectangle button. To 
draw a square or perfectly round circle, select the Rectangle button or the 
Oval button but hold down the Shift key while you draw.
 
You can adjust the size or shape of a rectangle or circle by clicking it and 
dragging any of its love handles (the small circles you see at the corners of the 
shape).
Creating Other Shapes
Rectangles and circles aren’t the only two shapes that PowerPoint can draw 
automatically. The Shapes gallery includes many other types of shapes you 
can draw, such as pentagons, stars, and flowchart symbols.
The Shapes gallery (refer to Figure 13-2) organizes shapes into the following 
categories:
 
✓ Recently Used Shapes: The top section of the gallery lists as many as 
24 of the shapes you’ve used most recently. The shapes found in this 
section change each time you draw a new shape.
 
✓ Lines: Straight lines, curved lines, lines with arrowheads, scribbly lines, 
and free-form shapes that can become polygons if you want. The free-
form shape is useful enough to merit its own section, “Drawing a polygon 
or free-form shape,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Rectangles: Basic rectangular shapes, including not just a regular 
rectangle but also rectangles with corners lopped off.
 
✓ Basic Shapes: Squares, rectangles, triangles, crosses, happy faces, 
lightning bolts, hearts, clouds, and more.

183
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
 
✓ Block Arrows: Fat arrows pointing in various directions.
 
✓ Equation Shapes: Shapes for drawing simple math equations.
 
✓ Flowchart: Various flowcharting symbols.
 
✓ Stars and Banners: Shapes that add sparkle to your presentations.
 
✓ Callouts: Text boxes and speech bubbles like those used in comic strips.
 
✓ Action Buttons: Buttons that you can add to your slides and click during 
a slide show to go directly to another slide or to run a macro.
Drawing a shape
The following steps explain how to draw a shape:
 
1. Click the Shapes button in the Illustrations group of the Insert tab.
 
 The Shapes gallery appears.
 
2. Select the shape you want to insert.
 
 When you select one of the shapes, the Shapes gallery disappears and 
PowerPoint is poised to draw the shape you selected.
 
3. Click the slide where you want the shape to appear and then drag the 
shape to the desired size.
 
 Hold down the Shift key while drawing the Shape to create an evenly 
proportioned shape.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the Shape object takes on the 
current fill color and line style.
 
4. (Optional) Start typing if you want the shape to contain text.
 
 After you’ve typed your text, you can use PowerPoint’s formatting 
features to change its typeface, size, color, and so on. For more 
information, refer to Chapter 8.
Some shapes — especially the stars and banners — cry out for text. 
Figure 13-4 shows how you can use a star shape to add a jazzy burst to a slide.
You can change an object’s shape at any time. First, select the shape. Then, 
open the Drawing Tools tab on the Ribbon, look in the Insert Shapes group, 
click the Edit Shape button, and choose Change Shape from the menu that 
appears.

184
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 13-4: 
Use a star 
shape to 
make your 
presentation 
look like a 
late-night 
infomercial.
 
 
Many shape buttons have an extra handle shaped like a yellow diamond that 
enables you to adjust some aspect of the object’s shape. For example, the 
block arrows have a handle that enables you to increase or decrease the size 
of the arrowhead. The location of these handles varies depending on the 
shape you’re working with. Figure 13-5 shows how you can use these extra 
handles to vary the shapes produced by six different shapes. For each of the 
six shapes, the first object shows how the shape is initially drawn; the other 
two objects drawn with each shape show how you can change the shape by 
dragging the extra handle. (Note that the yellow handles aren’t shown in this 
figure. When you select a shape that has one of these adjustment handles, the 
handles will appear.)
Drawing a polygon or free-form shape
Mr. Arnold, my seventh-grade math teacher, taught me that a polygon is a 
shape that has many sides and has nothing to do with having more than one 
spouse. (One is certainly enough for most people.) Triangles, squares, and 
rectangles are polygons, but so are hexagons, pentagons, and any unusual 
shapes whose sides all consist of straight lines. Politicians are continually 
inventing new polygons when they revise the boundaries of congressional 
districts.

185
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
 
Figure 13-5: 
You can 
create 
interesting 
variations 
by grabbing 
the extra 
handles 
on these 
shapes.
 
One of the most useful shapes in the Shapes gallery is the Freeform Shape 
tool. It’s designed to create polygons, but with a twist: Not all the sides have 
to be straight lines. The Freeform Shape tool lets you build a shape whose 
sides are a mixture of straight lines and free-form curves. Figure 13-6 shows 
three examples of shapes that I created with the Freeform Shape tool.
Follow these steps to create a polygon or free-form shape:
 
 
1. Select the Freeform shape (shown in the margin) from the Shapes 
gallery.
 
 You can find the Shapes gallery in the Shapes group on the Insert tab. 
When you select the Freeform Shape tool, the cursor changes to a 
cross-hair pointer.
 
2. Click where you want to position the first corner of the object.
 
3. Click where you want to position the second corner of the object.
 
4. Keep clicking wherever you want to position a corner.
 
5. (Optional) To draw a free-form side on the shape, hold down the 
mouse button when you click a corner and then drag to draw the 
free-form shape. When you get to the end of the free-form side, release 
the mouse button.

186
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 13-6: 
Three 
free-form 
shapes.
 
 
 You can then click again to add more corners. Shape 3 in Figure 13-6 has 
one free-form side.
 
6. To finish the shape, click near the first corner — the one that you 
created in Step 3.
 
 You don’t have to be exact: If you click anywhere near the first corner 
that you put down, PowerPoint assumes that the shape is finished.
You’re finished! The object assumes the line and fill color from the slide’s 
color scheme.
 
You can reshape a polygon or free-form shape by double-clicking it and then 
dragging any of the love handles that appear on the corners.
If you hold down the Shift key while you draw a polygon, the sides are 
constrained to 45-degree angles. Shape 2 in Figure 13-6 was drawn in this 
manner. How about a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to use 
the Shift key when it redraws congressional boundaries?
You also can use the Freeform Shape tool to draw a multisegmented line 
called an open shape. To draw an open shape, you can follow the steps in this 
section, except that you skip Step 6. Instead, double-click or press Esc when 
the line is done.

187
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
Drawing a curved line or shape
Another useful tool is the Curve Shape tool, which lets you draw curved lines 
or shapes. Figure 13-7 shows several examples of curved lines and shapes 
drawn with the Curve Shape tool.
 
Figure 13-7: 
Examples of 
curved lines 
and shapes.
 
Here’s the procedure for drawing a curved line or shape:
 
1. Select the Curve shape tool from the Shapes gallery.
 
 You’ll find the Shapes gallery in the Shapes group on the Insert tab. 
When you select this tool, the cursor changes to a cross-hair pointer.
 
2. Click where you want the curved line or shape to begin.
 
3. Click where you want the first turn in the curve to appear.
 
 The straight line turns to a curved line, bent around the point where you 
clicked. As you move the mouse, the bend of the curve changes.
 
4. Click to add turns to the curve.
 
 Each time you click, a new bend is added to the line. Keep clicking until 
the line is as twisty as you want.

188
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
5. To finish a line, double-click where you want the end of the curved 
line to appear. To create a closed shape, double-click over the starting 
point, where you clicked in Step 3.
Creating a text box
A text box is a special type of shape that’s designed to place text on your 
slides. To create a text box, call up the Insert tab, select the Text Box button 
in the Text group, and then click where you want one corner of the text box 
to appear and drag to where you want the opposite corner, just like you’re 
drawing a rectangle. When you release the mouse button, you can type text.
You can format the text that you type in the text box by highlighting the 
text and using the usual PowerPoint text formatting features, most of which 
are found on the Home tab. For more information about formatting text, see 
Chapter 8.
You can format the text box itself by using Shape Fill, Shape Outline, Shape 
Effects, and other tools available on the Drawing Tools tab, as described in 
the next section. By default, text boxes have no fill or line color, so the box 
itself is invisible on the slide — only the text is visible.
 
Most shapes also function as text boxes. If you want to add text to a shape, 
just click the shape and start typing. The text appears centered over the 
shape. (The only shapes that don’t accept text are lines and connectors.)
Styling Your Shapes
The center section of the Drawing Tools tab is called Shape Styles. It lets you 
control various stylistic features of your shapes. For example, you can set a 
fill color, set the outline, and add effects such as shadows or reflections.
You can set these styles individually, or you can choose one of the preselected 
shape styles that appears in the Shape Styles group. Note that the styles that 
appear in the Shape Styles group vary depending on the type of shape you’ve 
selected and the theme used for the presentation. For example, if you select a 
line, various predefined line styles are displayed. But if you select a rectangle, 
the styles appropriate for rectangles are displayed.

189
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
Setting the shape fill
The Shape Fill control (in the Shape Styles group of the Drawing Tools tab) 
lets you control how shapes are filled. The simplest type of fill is a solid 
color. But you can also use a picture, a gradient fill, or a pattern to fill the 
shape.
Working with shape fills is similar to working with background and theme 
colors. For more information on backgrounds and themes, check out 
Chapter 9.
Setting the shape outline
The Shape Outline control (in the Shape Styles group of the Drawing Tools 
tab) lets you change the style of line objects or the border for solid shape 
objects. You can change the following settings for the outline:
 
✓ Color: Sets the color used for the outline.
 
✓ Weight: Sets the thickness of the line.
 
✓ Dashes: The dashing pattern used for the lines that outline the object. 
The default uses a solid line, but different patterns are available to 
create dashed lines.
 
✓ Arrows: Lines can have an arrowhead at either or both ends. 
Arrowheads are used mostly on line and arc objects.
For maximum control over the outline style, select the More command from 
the menu that appears when you click the Fill, Outline, or Effects button. This 
brings up the Format Shape dialog box shown in Figure 13-8. From this dialog 
box, you can control all aspects of a line’s style: its color, width, dash pattern, 
and cap type (various arrowheads can be applied).
Applying shape effects
The Shape Effects button on the Drawing Tools tab on the Ribbon lets you 
apply several interesting types of effects to your shapes. When you click this 
button, a menu with the following effect options is displayed:

190
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 13-8: 
Formatting 
the line 
style.
 
 
✓ Shadow: Applies a shadow to the picture. You can select one of several 
predefined shadow effects, or you can call up a dialog box that lets you 
customize the shadow.
 
✓ Reflection: Creates a reflected image of the picture beneath the original 
picture.
 
✓ Glow: Adds a glowing effect around the edges of the picture.
 
✓ Soft Edges: Softens the edges of the picture.
 
✓ Bevel: Creates a beveled effect.
 
✓ 3-D Rotation: Rotates the picture in a way that creates a three-dimensional 
effect.
 
The best way to discover how to use these effects is to experiment with them 
to see how they work.
Flipping and Rotating Objects
To flip an object means to create a mirror image of it. To rotate an object 
means to turn it about its center. PowerPoint lets you flip objects horizontally or 
vertically, rotate objects in 90-degree increments, or freely rotate an object to 
any angle.

191
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
 
Rotation works for text boxes and Shape text. Thus, you can use rotation to 
create vertical text or text skewed to any angle you want. However, flipping an 
object doesn’t affect the object’s text.
Flipping an object
PowerPoint enables you to flip an object vertically or horizontally to create a 
mirror image of the object. To flip an object, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the object that you want to flip.
 
2. Open the Drawing Tools tab, click the Rotate button on the Arrange 
group, and then choose Flip Horizontal or Flip Vertical.
Rotating an object 90 degrees
You can rotate an object in 90-degree increments by following these steps:
 
1. Choose the object that you want to rotate.
 
2. Open the Drawing Tools tab, click the choose Rotate button on the 
Arrange group, and then choose Rotate Right or Rotate Left.
 
3. To rotate the object 180 degrees, click the appropriate Rotate button 
again.
Using the rotate handle
Remember how all the bad guys’ hideouts were slanted in the old Batman TV 
show? The rotate handle lets you give your drawings that same kind of slant. 
With the rotate handle, you can rotate an object to any arbitrary angle just by 
dragging it with the mouse.
The rotate handle is the green handle that appears when you select an object 
that can be rotated. The rotate handle appears above the object, connected 
to the object by a line, as shown in Figure 13-9. You can rotate an object to 
any angle simply by dragging the rotate handle.

192
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 13-9: 
The rotate 
handle lets 
you rotate 
an object 
to any arbi-
trary angle.
 
The following steps show you how to use the rotate handle:
 
1. Click the object that you want to rotate.
 
2. Drag the rotate handle in the direction that you want to rotate the 
object.
 
 As you drag, an outline of the object rotates around. When you get the 
object’s outline to the angle you want, release the mouse button, and 
the object is redrawn at the new angle.
 
To restrict the rotation angle to 15-degree increments, hold the Shift key while 
dragging around the rotation handle.
Drawing a Complicated Picture
When you add more than one object to a slide, you might run into several 
problems. What happens when the objects overlap? How do you line up 
objects so that they don’t look like they were thrown at the slide from a 
moving car? And how do you keep together objects that belong together?
The following sections show you how to use PowerPoint features to handle 
overlapped objects and how to align and group objects.
Changing layers
Whenever you have more than one object on a slide, the potential exists for 
objects to overlap one another. Like most drawing programs, PowerPoint 
handles this problem by layering objects like a stack of plates. The first 

193
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
object that you draw is at the bottom of the stack; the second object is on 
top of the first; the third is atop the second object; and so on. If two objects 
overlap, the one that’s at the highest layer wins; objects below it are partially 
covered. (Note that PowerPoint’s layers aren’t nearly as powerful as layers 
in programs like Adobe Illustrator or AutoCAD. All they really do is set the 
stacking order when objects are placed on top of one another.)
So far, so good — but what if you don’t remember to draw the objects in 
the correct order? What if you draw a shape that you want to tuck behind 
a shape that you’ve already drawn, or what if you want to bring an existing 
shape to the top of the pecking order? No problem. PowerPoint enables you 
to change the stacking order by moving objects toward the front or back so 
that they overlap just the way you want.
The Drawing Tools tab provides two controls that let you move an object 
forward or backward in the layer order:
 
✓ Bring to Front: Brings the chosen object to the top of the stack. Note 
that this button has a down arrow next to it. If you click this down 
arrow, you reveal a menu with two subcommands: Bring to Front and 
Bring Forward. The Bring Forward command moves the object just one 
step closer to the top of the heap, whereas the Bring to Front command 
moves the object all the way to the top.
 
✓ Send to Back: Sends the chosen object to the back of the stack. Again, 
this button has a down arrow next to it. You can click this down arrow 
to access the Send Backward subcommand, which sends the object one 
level down in the layer order.
Layering problems are most obvious when objects have a fill color. If an 
object has no fill color, objects behind it are allowed to show through. In this 
case, the layering doesn’t matter much.
To bring an object to the top of another, you might have to use the Bring 
Forward command several times. The reason is that even though the two 
objects appear to be adjacent, other objects might occupy the layers 
between them.
Line ’em up
Nothing looks more amateurish than objects dropped randomly on a slide 
with no apparent concern for how they line up with each other. The Drawing 
Tools tab includes an Align button that brings up a menu with the following 
commands:

194
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Align Left
 
✓ Align Center
 
✓ Align Right
 
✓ Align Top
 
✓ Align Middle
 
✓ Align Bottom
 
✓ Distribute Horizontally
 
✓ Distribute Vertically
The first three commands (Align Left, Center, and Right) align items horizontally; 
the next three commands (Align Top, Middle, and Bottom) align items 
vertically.
You can also distribute several items so that they’re spaced evenly. Select 
the items that you want to distribute, click the Draw button, choose Align or 
Distribute, and then choose Distribute Horizontally or Distribute Vertically. 
PowerPoint then adjusts the spacing of the objects that appear between the 
two outermost objects selected.
 
Another quick way to align one item to another is to simply drag the first item 
until it is close to the alignment you want. When the item reaches the correct 
alignment, a magic guideline will appear to indicate that you have found the 
correct alignment. If you release the mouse button while this magic guideline 
is visible, the object will be snapped into alignment.
Using the grids and guides
To help you create well-ordered slides, PowerPoint lets you display a grid of 
evenly spaced lines over the slide. These lines aren’t actually a part of the 
slide, so your audience won’t see them when you give your presentation. 
They exist simply to make the task of lining things up a bit easier.
In addition to the grid, PowerPoint also lets you use guides. The guides 
are two lines — one horizontal, the other vertical — that appear onscreen. 
Although the gridlines are fixed in their location on your slides, you can 
move the guides around as you want. Any object that comes within a pixel’s 
breadth of one of these guidelines snaps to it. Like the grid, the guides don’t 
show up when you give your presentation. They appear only when you’re 
editing your slides. Guides are a great way to line up objects in a neat row.

195
 Chapter 13: Drawing on Your Slides
To display the grid or guides, click the dialog box launcher in the bottom-
right corner of the Show section of the View tab on the Ribbon. This click 
summons the Grid and Guides dialog box, shown in Figure 13-10.
 
Figure 13-10: 
The Grid 
and Guides 
dialog box.
 
To activate the grid, select the Snap Objects to Grid check box and then 
adjust the grid spacing to whatever setting you want. If you want to actually 
see the grid onscreen, select the Display Grid on Screen check box.
To fire up the guides, select the Display Drawing Guides on Screen check box. 
After the guides are visible, you can move them around the slide by clicking 
and dragging them.
You can also uncheck Display Smart Guides When Shapes Are Aligned to 
disable the guidelines that appear when you move shapes into alignment 
with each other. This is a useful feature, however; so I recommend that you 
leave this option checked.
Group therapy
A group is a collection of objects that PowerPoint treats as though it were one 
object. Using groups properly is one key to putting simple shapes together 
to make complex pictures without becoming so frustrated that you have to 
join a therapy group. (“Hello, my name is Doug, and PowerPoint drives me 
crazy.”)
To create a group, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose all objects that you want to include in the group.
 
 You can do this by holding down the Shift key and clicking each of the 
items or by clicking and dragging the resulting rectangle around all the 
items.

196
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
2. Right click one of the selected objects and then choose Group➪Group 
from the menu that appears.
You can also find the Group command on the Drawing Tools tab, but it’s 
much easier to find by right-clicking.
To take a group apart so that PowerPoint treats the objects as individuals 
again, follow these steps:
 
1. Right click the group you want to break up.
 
2. Choose Group➪Ungroup.
If you create a group and then ungroup it so that you can work on its elements 
individually, you can easily regroup the objects. These steps show you how:
 
1. Right click one of the objects that was in the original group.
 
2. Choose Group➪Regroup.
 
 PowerPoint remembers which objects were in the group and automatically 
includes them.
PowerPoint enables you to create groups of groups. This capability is useful 
for complex pictures because it enables you to work on one part of the 
picture, group it, and then work on the next part of the picture without 
worrying about accidentally disturbing the part that you’ve already grouped. 
After you have several such groups, select them and group them. You can 
create groups of groups of groups and so on, ad nauseam.

Charting for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
▶ Adding a chart to your presentation
▶ Getting data from other programs
▶ Moving and resizing your chart
▶ Embellishing your chart with titles, legends, and other stuff
O
ne of the best ways to prove a point is with numbers, and one of the 
best ways to present numbers is in a chart. With PowerPoint, adding a 
chart to your presentation is easy. And getting the chart to look the way you 
want is usually easy, too. It takes a little bit of pointing and clicking, but it 
works. This chapter shows you how.
Understanding Charts
If you’ve never attempted to add a chart to a slide, the process can be a little 
confusing. A chart is simply a series of numbers rendered as a graph. You can 
supply the numbers yourself, or you can copy them from a separate file, such 
as an Excel spreadsheet. You can create all kinds of different charts, ranging 
from simple bar charts and pie charts to exotic doughnut charts and radar 
charts. Very cool, but a little confusing to the uninitiated.
The following list details some of the jargon that you have to contend with 
when you’re working with charts:
 
✓ Graph or chart: Same thing. These terms are used interchangeably. A 
graph or chart is nothing more than a bunch of numbers turned into a 
picture. After all, a picture is worth a thousand numbers.
 
✓ Chart type: PowerPoint supports several chart types: bar charts, 
column charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter charts, area charts, radar 
charts, Dunkin’ Donut charts, and others. You can even create cone 
charts that look like something that fell off a Fembot in an Austin Powers 
movie. Different types of charts are better suited to displaying different 
types of data.

198
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Chart Layout: A predefined combination of chart elements such as 
headings and legends that lets you easily create a common type of chart.
 
✓ Chart Style: A predefined combination of formatting elements that 
controls the visual appearance of a chart.
 
✓ Datasheet: Supplies the underlying data for a chart. After all, a chart is 
nothing more than a bunch of numbers made into a picture. Those 
numbers come from the datasheet, which is actually an Excel spreadsheet. 
When you create a chart, PowerPoint automatically starts Excel (if it 
isn’t already running) and uses Excel to hold the numbers in the datasheet.
 
✓ Series: A collection of related numbers. For example, a chart of quarterly 
sales by region might have a series for each region. Each series has four 
sales totals, one for each quarter. Each series is usually represented by 
a row on the datasheet, but you can change the datasheet so that each 
column represents a series. Most chart types can plot more than one 
series. Pie charts can plot only one series at a time, however. The name 
of each series can be displayed in a legend.
 
✓ Axes: The lines on the edges of a chart. The X-axis is the line along the 
bottom of the chart; the Y-axis is the line along the left edge of the chart. 
The X-axis usually indicates categories. Actual data values are plotted 
along the Y-axis. Microsoft Graph automatically provides labels for the 
X- and Y-axes, but you can change them.
 
✓ Legend: A box used to identify the various series plotted on the chart. 
PowerPoint can create a legend automatically if you want one.
 
The most interesting thing to know about charting in PowerPoint 2010 is that 
it is closely integrated with Excel 2010. When you insert a chart in PowerPoint, 
Excel is automatically started, and the data that you chart is placed in an Excel 
workbook. However, that Excel workbook isn’t stored as a separate document. 
Instead, the chart and the datasheet workbook are stored within the 
PowerPoint document.
Adding a Chart to Your Presentation
To add a chart to your presentation, you have several options:
 
✓ Create a new slide by using a layout that includes a Content placeholder 
(an object that reserves space for content on the slide). Then click the 
Chart icon in the Content placeholder to create the chart.
 
✓ Use the Insert tab to insert a chart into any slide.

199
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
✓ Create the chart separately in Excel 2010 and then paste the chart into 
PowerPoint. This is the most common method if the chart is based on 
data that’s already stored in an Excel workbook.
Adding a new slide with a chart
The following procedure shows how to insert a new slide that contains a chart:
 
1. Move to the slide that you want the new slide to follow.
 
2. Click the Home tab and then click the New Slide button in the Slides 
group.
 
 This action reveals a list of slide layouts.
 
3. Click one of the slide layouts that includes a Content placeholder.
 
 Several slide types include a Content placeholder. When you click the one 
you want, a slide with the selected layout is added to your presentation, as 
shown in Figure 14-1. (In this case, I chose the “Title and Content” layout.)
 
 As you can see, the Content placeholder includes six little icons for 
inserting different types of content:

5. Select the type of chart you want to create.
 
 You can select any of the following chart types:
 
• Column: Data is shown as vertical columns. The columns can be 
displayed side by side or stacked, and you can pick various shapes 
for the columns including simple bars, 3-D blocks, cylinders, cones, 
and pyramids.
 
• Line: The data is shown as individual points linked by various 
types of lines.
 
• Pie: The data is shown as slices in a circular pie.
 
• Bar: The same as a column chart, except the columns are laid out 
horizontally instead of vertically.

201
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
• Area: Similar to a line chart, but the areas beneath the lines are 
shaded.
 
• X Y (Scatter): Plots individual points using two values to represent 
the X, Y coordinates.
 
• Stock: Plots high/low/close values.
 
• Surface: Similar to a line chart but represents the data as a 
three-dimensional surface.
 
• Doughnut: Similar to a pie chart, but with a hole in the middle.
 
• Bubble: Similar to a scatter chart but uses a third value to 
determine the size of the bubble.
 
• Radar: Plots data relative to a central point rather than to X, Y 
axes.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 PowerPoint whirs and grinds for a moment and then inserts the chart 
into the slide, as shown in Figure 14-3. The reason for all the commotion 
is that to insert the chart, PowerPoint must find out whether Excel is 
already running. If not, PowerPoint launches Excel as you can see in the 
figure.

7. Change the sample data to something more realistic.
 
 The data for the chart is shown in Excel, tiled alongside PowerPoint, 
as you can see back in Figure 14-3. You need to change this worksheet 
to provide the data you want to chart. Notice that the chart changes to 
reflect the new data as soon as you return to PowerPoint (by clicking 
anywhere in the PowerPoint window).
 
 For more information, turn to the section “Working with Chart Data,” 
later in this chapter.
 
8. Customize the chart any way you want.
 
 For example, you can change the chart layout or style, as described later 
in this chapter. Figure 14-4 shows a finished chart.
 
Figure 14-4:

a finished 
chart.
 
Adding a chart to an existing slide
If you prefer, you can add a chart to an existing slide by following these 
steps:
 
1. Move to the slide on which you want to place the chart.

203
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
2. Activate the Insert tab on the Ribbon. Click the Chart button in the 
Illustrations group.
 
 This step summons the Insert Chart dialog box, shown earlier in 
Figure 14-2.
 
3. Select the type of chart you want to create and then click OK.
 
 PowerPoint launches Excel (if it isn’t already running) and inserts a 
chart based on sample data.
 
 See the section “Changing the Chart Type,” later in this chapter, for 
more information about chart types.
 
4. Change the sample data to something more realistic.
 
 For more information about working with chart data, check out the 
section “Working with Chart Data,” later in this chapter.
 
5. Finish the chart by setting the chart layout and style.
 
 For more information, see the sections “Changing the Chart Layout” and 
“Changing the Chart Style,” later in this chapter.
 
6. Rearrange everything.
 
 The chart undoubtedly falls on top of something else already on the 
slide. You probably need to resize the chart by selecting it and then 
dragging it by the love handles. You can move the chart like any other 
object: Just click and drag it to a new location. You might also need 
to move, resize, or delete other objects to make room for the chart or 
change the layer order of the chart or other surrounding objects. You 
can find information about these manipulations in Chapter 13.
Pasting a chart from Excel
If the data you want to chart already exists in an Excel workbook, the easiest 
way to chart it in PowerPoint is to first create the chart in Excel. Then copy 
the chart to the clipboard, switch over to PowerPoint, and paste the chart 
to the appropriate slide. When you do so, the chart appears in PowerPoint 
exactly as it did in Excel.
When you paste an Excel chart into PowerPoint, a smart tag appears near 
the bottom right of the chart. You can click this smart tag to reveal a menu 
that lets you indicate whether you want to keep the original formatting of the 
chart or use the theme in the PowerPoint presentation.

204
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
In addition, the smart tag lets you indicate whether the chart should be 
embedded or linked. If you embed the chart, PowerPoint creates a copy of 
the Excel data and stores it as a workbook object within your PowerPoint file. 
This effectively severs the chart in the PowerPoint presentation from 
the original workbook, so any changes you make to the data in the original 
workbook aren’t reflected in the PowerPoint chart.
On the other hand, if you link the chart, PowerPoint copies the chart into the 
PowerPoint presentation but creates a link to the data in the original Excel 
workbook. Then any changes you make to the data in the original Excel 
workbook are reflected in the chart.
One final option on the smart tag lets you insert the chart as a picture. If 
you choose this option, PowerPoint converts the chart to a collection of 
PowerPoint shape objects, with no linkage to the original Excel chart or data.
Changing the Chart Type
PowerPoint enables you to create 14 basic types of charts. Each type conveys 
information with a different emphasis. Sales data plotted in a column chart 
might emphasize the relative performance of different regions, for example, 
and the same data plotted as a line chart might emphasize an increase 
or decrease in sales over time. The type of chart that’s best for your data 
depends on the nature of the data and which aspects of it you want to 
emphasize.
Fortunately, PowerPoint doesn’t force you to decide the final chart type up 
front. You can easily change the chart type at any time without changing the 
chart data. These steps show you how:
 
1. Click the chart to select it.
 
 When you select a chart, a set of three tabs called the Chart Tools is 
added to the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Design tab, as shown in Figure 14-5.
 
Figure 14-5:

205
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
 
3. Click the Change Chart Type button (shown in the margin)
 
 PowerPoint displays a gallery of chart types.
 
4. Click the chart type that you want.
 
5. Click OK, and you’re done.
Working with Chart Data
The data that provides the numbers plotted in a PowerPoint chart is stored 
in an Excel workbook. Depending on how you created the chart, this Excel 
workbook can either be a separate workbook document or be embedded 
within your PowerPoint document. Either way, you can work with Excel 
whenever you want to modify the chart data.
To change the data on which a chart is based, select the chart. A set of three 
tabs called the Chart Tools is automatically added to the Ribbon when you 
select the chart. Next, choose the Design tab. This tab includes a group called 
Data, which provides four controls. These controls let you perform various 
tricks on the data, as described in the following sections.
Switching rows and columns
 
 The first control in the Data group, shown in the margin, is called Switch 
Row/Column. It changes the orientation of your chart in a way that can 
be difficult to describe but easy to visualize. Look back at the chart in 
Figure 14-4. It’s based on the following data:
River City
Pixley
Hootersville
Instruments
20.4
50.6
45.9
Music
27.4
38.6
46.9
Uniforms
90
34.6
45
Instruction
75
102
89
As shown earlier in Figure 14-4, the rows are used to determine the data 
categories. Thus, the chart displays the data for Instruments, Music, 
Uniforms, and Instruction along the horizontal axis.

206
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
If you click the Switch Row/Column button, the chart changes, as shown in 
Figure 14-6. Here, the chart categorizes the data by city, so sales for River 
City, Pixley, and Hootersville are shown along the horizontal axis.
 
Figure 14-6: 
Swapping 
the row/
column 
orientation 
of a chart.
 
Changing the data selection
 
 The Select Data button in the Data group of the Design tab (shown in the 
margin) lets you change the selection of data that your chart is based on. 
When you click this button, you’re escorted to Excel, and the dialog box 
shown in Figure 14-7 is displayed.
This dialog box lets you do three basic tasks:
 
✓ Change the range. You can change the range of data that’s used for the 
chart by using the Chart Data Range text box.
 
✓ Switch row/column. You can switch rows and columns by clicking 
the Switch Row/Column button. This has the same effect as clicking the 
Switch Row/Column button back in PowerPoint.
 
✓ Modify ranges and series. You can play with the individual ranges that 
contain the data for each series. You can add a new series, edit the 
range used for an existing series, delete a series, or change the order in 
which the series are presented.

207
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit

The Select 
Data Source 
dialog box.
 
Editing the source data
 
 To change the actual data values on which a chart is based, click the Edit 
Data button in the Data group of the Design tab (shown in the margin). This 
action launches Excel to display the chart data. You can then make any 
changes you want. When you return to PowerPoint (by clicking anywhere in 
the PowerPoint window), the chart is updated to reflect your changes.
Refreshing a chart
If a chart is linked to a separate Excel workbook, you can update the chart 
to reflect any changes that have been made to the underlying data. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart to select it.
 
 The Ribbon expands to include the Chart Tools tabs.
 
2. Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
 
3. Click the Refresh button in the Data group.
 
 The chart is updated with the data from the underlying Excel workbook.
Changing the Chart Layout
A chart layout is a predefined combination of chart elements such as legends, 
titles, and so on. Microsoft studied thousands of charts and talked to chart 
experts to come up with galleries of the most common layouts for each chart 
type. For example, Figure 14-8 shows the Chart Layout gallery for column 
charts.

208
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 14-8:

To change the layout for a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart to select it.
 
 The Ribbon expands to include the Chart Tools tabs.
 
2. Click the Layout tab on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
Figure 14-9:

3. Click the Quick Layout button.
 
 This brings up the Chart Layout Gallery, which was shown in Figure 14-8.
 
4. Click the layout you want to use.
 
 The layout you select is applied to the chart.
Changing the Chart Style
A chart style is a predefined combination of formatting elements such as 
colors and shape effects. Microsoft provides a large assortment of chart 
styles to choose from. For example, Figure 14-10 shows the Chart Style 
gallery for column charts.

209
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
Figure 14-10:

To change the style for a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart to select it.
 
 The Ribbon expands to include the three Chart Tools tabs. (Refer to 
Figure 14-5.)
 
2. Click the Design tab.
 
3. Select the style you want to use from the Chart Styles group.
 
 The Chart Styles group displays the most commonly used styles for the 
chart type.
 
 If the style you want to use isn’t visible in this group, you can click the 
More button to display a gallery of all available styles. (The More button 
is the down-arrow button at the bottom of the scroll bar that appears at 
the right side of the Chart Styles group.)
Embellishing Your Chart
PowerPoint enables you to embellish a chart in many ways: You can add 
titles, labels, legends, and who knows what else. The easiest way to add 
these elements is by selecting a chart layout, as described in the earlier 
section “Changing the Chart Layout.” However, you can create your own 
unique chart layout by adding these elements individually.
To do that, select the chart to reveal the Chart Tools tab on the Ribbon, then 
select the Layout tab that has several groups of controls as described in the 
following paragraphs.
The Current Selection group lets you apply formatting to the part of the 
graph that is currently selected.

210
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
The Insert group on this tab lets you insert a picture, shape, or text box. For 
more information about working with these elements, refer to Chapter 13.
The Labels group on the Layout tab lets you add various types of labels to 
your chart:
 
✓ Chart titles: A chart title describes the chart’s contents. It normally 
appears at the top of the chart, but you can drag it to any location.
 
✓ Axis titles: These titles describe the meaning of each chart axis. Most 
charts use two axes titles: the Primary Horizontal Axis Title and the 
Primary Vertical Axis Title.
 
✓ Legends: A legend identifies the data series that appear in the chart. 
When you click the Legend button, a menu with several choices for the 
placement of the legend appears. You can also choose More Legend 
Options to display the Format Legend dialog box, shown in Figure 14-11. 
From this dialog box, you can set the position of the legend as well as 
control various formatting options for the legend, such as the fill and 
border style. (Note that you can also drag the legend to move it to 
another location in the chart.)
 
Figure 14-11: 
The Format 
Legend 
dialog box.
 
 
 PowerPoint enables you to create a legend, but you’re on your own if 
you need a myth or fable.
 
✓ Data Labels: Lets you add labels to the data points on the chart. For 
maximum control over the data labels, choose More Data Label Options 
to display the dialog box shown in Figure 14-12.

211
 Chapter 14: Charting for Fun and Profit
 
Figure 14-12: 
The Format 
Data Labels 
dialog box.
 
 
 For most slide types, data labels add unnecessary clutter without adding 
much useful information. Use labels only if you think that you must back 
up your chart with exact numbers.
 
✓ Data Table: The data table is a table that shows the data used to create 
a chart. Most charts do not include a data table, but you can add one if 
you think your audience will benefit from seeing the raw numbers. For 
example, Figure 14-13 shows a chart with a data table.
The Axes group on the Layout tab includes just two controls:
 
✓ Axes: Sometimes an axe is what you’d like to use to fix your computer. 
But in this case, axes refer to the X- and Y-axes on which chart data is 
plotted. The X-axis is the horizontal axis of the chart, and the Y-axis is 
the vertical axis. For 3-D charts, a third axis — Z — is also used. The 
Axes control lets you show or hide the labels used for each chart axis.
 
✓ Gridlines: Gridlines are light lines drawn behind a chart to make it easier 
to judge the position of each dot, bar, or line plotted by the chart. You 
can turn gridlines on or off via the Gridlines button.
The Background group on the Layout tab includes the following useful 
controls for formatting various parts of the chart background:
 
✓ Plot area: This button lets you format the background of the main area 
of the chart.
 
✓ Chart wall: For chart formats that have a wall, this button lets you 
control the format of the wall.

212
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Chart floor: For chart formats that have a floor, this button lets you 
control the floor’s format.
 
✓ 3-D View: For charts that have a 3-D format, this button lets you control 
the rotation and other aspects of the 3-D display.
The Analysis group lets you add even more elements that can help your 
audience interpret the meaning of your graph. For example, you can add a 
trend line to show sales (which are hopefully trending up) versus expenses 
(which are hopefully trending down).

Working with SmartArt
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the SmartArt feature
▶ Creating diagrams using SmartArt
▶ Creating organization charts
You’ll hear nothing but yawns from the back row if your presentation 
consists of slide after slide of text and bulleted lists with an occasional 
bit of clip art thrown in for good measure. Mercifully, PowerPoint is well 
equipped to add all sorts of embellishments to your slides. This chapter 
shows you how to work with one of the coolest ways to embellish your 
slides: adding special diagrams called SmartArt.
Understanding SmartArt
PowerPoint includes a nifty little feature called SmartArt, which lets you add 
several different types of useful diagrams to your slides. With SmartArt, you 
can create List, Process, Cycle, Hierarchy, Relationship, Matrix, Pyramid, 
and Picture diagrams. And each of these basic diagram types has multiple 
variations. In all, there are 167 variations you can choose from.
The diagrams created by SmartArt consist of multiple elements such as 
shapes and lines. SmartArt itself takes care of drawing these elements in 
a coordinated fashion, so you don’t have to draw the separate elements 
manually.
The basic idea behind SmartArt diagrams is to represent bullet lists as a 
diagram of interconnected shapes. Although many different types of 
SmartArt diagrams are available, they all work the same way. The only real 
difference among the various SmartArt diagram types is how they graphically 
represent the bullets. For example, consider the following bullet list:

214
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Arrive
 
✓ Work
 
✓ Lunch
 
✓ More work
 
✓ Leave
Figure 15-1 shows this list represented by two different types of SmartArt. 
All I did to create both of these SmartArt diagrams was select the text, right-
click, and choose Convert to SmartArt. The only difference between the two 
is the type of SmartArt diagram I selected.
Note that many of the SmartArt diagram types can display two or more 
outline levels in your bullet list. For example, suppose you have this list:
 
✓ Arrive
 
• Stop for coffee on the way
 
• Try not to be late
 
✓ Work
 
• Coffee break at 10:00
 
• Look smart!
 
✓ Lunch
 
• Best part of the day!
 
✓ More work
 
• Coffee break at 2:00
 
• Try to stay awake at 4:00
 
✓ Leave
 
• Leave early today?
Figure 15-2 shows how this list appears when formatted as an Increasing 
Arrows Process chart. As you can see, the second-level bullets are incorporated 
as text within the diagram.
One of the most useful aspects of SmartArt is that you can easily change from 
one type of diagram to another. Thus, if you decide that a diagram doesn’t 
convey the message you intend, you can try changing the diagram type to see 
whether the message is clearer.

Creating a SmartArt Diagram
The easiest way to create a SmartArt diagram is to create a new slide and 
enter the bullet list as if you were going to display the list as normal text and 
then convert the text to SmartArt. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new slide with the Title and Content layout.
 
2. Type your bullet list.
 
 Use one or two levels of bullets, but try to keep the list as short and 
concise as you can.
 
3. Right-click anywhere in the list and choose Convert to SmartArt.
 
 A menu of SmartArt diagram types appears, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
4. Select the SmartArt type you want to use.
 
 If the SmartArt type doesn’t appear in the menu, you can choose More 
SmartArt Graphics to display the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 15-4. As you can see, this dialog box lets you choose 
from about a million different SmartArt diagram types. PowerPoint offers 
eight basic categories of SmartArt diagrams; these diagram types are 
pictured and described in Table 15-1.

 For more information, see the section “Tweaking a SmartArt Diagram,” 
later in this chapter.
 
7. You’re done!
 
 Well, you’re never really done. You can keep tweaking your diagram 
until the end of time to get it perfect. But at some point, you have to say, 
“Enough is enough,” and call it finished.

Tweaking a SmartArt Diagram
After you’ve created a SmartArt diagram, you can adjust its appearance in 
many ways. The easiest is to change the SmartArt Style that’s applied to the 
diagram. A SmartArt Style is simply a collection of formatting elements such 
as colors and shape effects that are assigned to the various elements of a 
SmartArt diagram.
Microsoft provides a large assortment of SmartArt styles to choose from. For 
example, Figure 15-5 shows the style gallery for Pyramid diagrams.

 Chapter 15: Working with SmartArt
To change the quick style for a SmartArt diagram, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the diagram to select it.
 
 This adds the SmartArt tools to the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Design tab.
 
 Figure 15-6 depicts the SmartArt Tools Design tab.
 
Figure 15-6:

3. Select the style you want to use from the SmartArt Styles group.
 
 The Quick Styles group displays the most commonly used styles for 
the diagram type. If the style you want to use isn’t visible in this group, 
you can click the More button to display a gallery like the one that was 
shown in Figure 15-5.
Note that the SmartArt Tools Design tab also includes controls that let you 
modify the SmartArt diagram by adding additional shapes or bullet items 
or changing the chart type. You can also reset the diagram to its original 
appearance by clicking the Reset Graphic button found in the Reset group.
Editing the SmartArt Text
When you create a SmartArt diagram from an existing bullet list, the bullet 
text is replaced by the diagram. This raises an important question: After 
you’ve converted the text to SmartArt, what do you do if you need to modify 
the text?
To modify SmartArt text, simply select the SmartArt diagram. Then click 
the little double-arrow icon that appears on the left edge of the diagram’s 
selection box. This action reveals a fly-out window called the Text pane, in 
which you can edit the bullet points. See Figure 15-7.

Working with Organization Charts
Organization charts — you know, those box-and-line charts that show who 
reports to whom, where the buck stops, and who got the lateral arabesque —
are an essential part of many presentations. The hierarchical SmartArt dia-
grams are ideal for creating organization charts. You can create diagrams 
that show bosses, subordinates, co-workers, and assistants. You can easily 
rearrange the chain of command and add new boxes or delete boxes. Figure 
15-8 shows a finished organization chart.
The bullet list I used to create this chart looked like this before I converted it 
to SmartArt:
 
✓ Doc
 
• Sneezy
 
• Grumpy
 
 • Sleepy
 
 • Happy
 
• Bashful

221
 Chapter 15: Working with SmartArt
Flowcharts, anyone?
One type of diagram that people often want to 
create with PowerPoint is a flowchart. Although 
SmartArt doesn’t have an option for creating 
flowcharts, you can easily create flowcharts by 
using PowerPoint’s AutoShapes. For example, 
take a look at the following flowchart, which I 
created with just a few minutes’ work.
To create a flowchart like this, follow these 
basic steps:
 1. Draw each flowchart shape by using basic 
shape objects as described in Chapter 13.
 
 Use the shapes in the Flowchart section of 
the Shapes gallery to create the shapes for 
the flowchart, and use arrows to connect 
the shapes.
 2. Enter text into each flowchart shape by 
clicking the shape and typing.
 
 If necessary, adjust the text font and size.
 3. Adjust the alignment of your shapes.
 
 Here’s where the flowcharting AutoShapes 
really shine: The connectors stay attached 
to the shapes even when you move the 
shapes around! Pretty slick, eh?

chart.
 
Notice that Dopey isn’t in this list. That’s because Dopey is in a special kind 
of box on the chart, called an Assistant. You find out how to add Assistant 
boxes later in this chapter.
 
Keep in mind that organization charts are useful for more than showing 
employee relationships. You also can use them to show any kind of hierarchical 
structure. For example, back when I wrote computer programs for a living, 
I used organization charts to plan the structure of my computer programs. 
They’re also great for recording family genealogies, although they don’t have 
any way to indicate that Aunt Milly hasn’t spoken to Aunt Beatrice in 30 years.
Adding boxes to a chart
You can add a box to an organization chart by calling up the Text pane and 
editing the text. Refer to the section “Editing the SmartArt Text,” earlier in 
this chapter, for tips on how to do that.
Alternatively, you can use the controls in the SmartArt Tools tab on the 
Ribbon to add boxes. One nice feature that these controls provide is the 
ability to add an Assistant, which is a box that appears outside of the 
hierarchical chain of command. Here are the steps:

223
 Chapter 15: Working with SmartArt
 
1. Click the box you want the new box to be below or next to.
 
2. Open the SmartArt Tools tab on the Ribbon.
 
3. Click the Add Shape button to reveal a menu of choices. Then select 
one of the following options:
 
• Add Shape Before: Inserts a new box at the same level as the 
selected box, immediately to its left.
 
• Add Shape After: Inserts a new box at the same level as the selected 
box, immediately to its right.
 
• Add Shape Above: Inserts a new box above the selected box.
 
• Add Shape Below: Inserts a new box beneath the selected box.
 
• Add Assistant: Inserts a new box beneath the selected box, but the 
new box is connected with a special elbow connector to indicate 
that the box is an Assistant, not a subordinate.
 
4. Click the new box and then type whatever text you want to appear in 
the box.
 
5. If necessary, drag the box to adjust its location.
Deleting chart boxes
To delete a box from an organization chart, select the box and press Delete. 
PowerPoint automatically adjusts the chart to compensate for the lost box.
When you delete a box from an organization chart, you should observe a 
moment of somber silence — or throw a party. It all depends on whose name 
was in the box, I suppose.
Changing the chart layout
PowerPoint lets you choose from four methods of arranging subordinates in 
an organization chart branch:
 
✓ Standard: Subordinate shapes are placed at the same level beneath the 
superior shape.
 
✓ Both Hanging: Subordinates are placed two per level beneath the 
superior with the connecting line between them.
 
✓ Left Hanging: Subordinates are stacked vertically beneath the superior, 
to the left of the connecting line.
 
✓ Right Hanging: Subordinates are stacked vertically beneath the 
superior, to the right of the connecting line.

Figure 15-9 shows an organization chart that uses all four of these layouts. 
Sneezy, Grumpy, and Bashful use Standard layout. Sleepy and Happy use 
Both Hanging layout. Groucho, Harpo, and Chico use Left Hanging layout, and 
Manny, Moe, and Jack use Right Hanging layout.
To change the layout of a branch of your chart, first click the shape at the top 
of the branch, and then click the SmartArt Tools Design tab on the Ribbon. 
Then click the Layout button in the Create Graphic group and choose the 
layout type you want to use.

(Adding Sound and Video)
In This Chapter
▶ Adding burps, chortles, and gee-whizzes to your presentation
▶ Playing music from a CD with your presentation
▶ Narrating your presentations
▶ Fiddling with video
O
ne of the cool things about PowerPoint is that it lets you create slides 
that contain not only text and pictures but also sounds and even 
movies. You can add sound effects such as screeching brakes or breaking 
glass to liven up dull presentations. You can even add your own applause, 
making your presentation like a TV sitcom or game show. You can also add a 
musical background to your presentation.
Additionally, you can insert a film clip from The African Queen or a picture 
of the space shuttle launching if you think that will help keep people awake. 
This chapter shows you how to add those special effects.
This chapter is short because you can’t do as much with sound and video in 
PowerPoint as you can with, say, a professional multimedia-authoring program 
such as Adobe Director. Still, PowerPoint allows you to paste sound and 
video elements into your slide show, thus giving you the power to craft some 
impressive high-tech presentations. And PowerPoint 2010 introduces new 
video-editing features that let you perform basic edits on the videos you 
insert.
Getting Ready to Add Sound to a Slide
A sterile beep used to be the only sound you could get from your computer. 
Nowadays, you can make your computer talk almost as well as the computers 
in the Star Trek movies, or you can give your computer a sophomoric sense 
of audible distaste. At last, the computer can be as obnoxious as the user!

226
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
Investigating sound files
Computer sounds are stored in sound files, which come in two basic varieties:
 
✓ Wave files: Wave files contain digitized recordings of real sounds. These 
sounds can be sound effects, such as cars screeching, guns firing, or 
drums rolling; music; or even quotes from movies or your favorite TV 
shows. (Imagine Darth Vader saying to your audience, “I find your lack 
of faith disturbing.”)
 
 Wave files come in several formats:
 
• WAV: The basic format for wave files is the standard Windows 
WAV format. Both Windows and PowerPoint come with a collection 
of WAV files that provide simple sound effects such as swooshes, 
blips, applause, and drum rolls.
 
• MP3 and WMA: For longer sound clips, such as complete songs, 
the popular formats to use include MP3 and WMA. MP3 is a 
compressed format that’s popular for sounds obtained from the 
Internet, and WMA is a newer audio format developed by Microsoft 
for newer versions of Windows. You can tell the format of a 
sound file by the filename’s extension (.mp3 or .wma). (There’s an 
improved version of MP3 out called MP4, but it isn’t used much yet.)
 
✓ MIDI files: MIDI files contain music stored in a form that the sound 
card’s synthesizer can play. Windows comes with several MIDI files, and 
you can download many more from the Internet. MIDI files have the file 
extension .mid.
To insert a sound into a PowerPoint presentation, all you have to do is paste 
one of these sound files into a slide. Then when you run the presentation in 
Slide Show View, you can have the sounds play automatically during slide 
transitions, or you can play them manually by clicking the Sound button.
You’re more likely to use wave files than MIDI files in a PowerPoint 
presentation. MIDI files are great for playing music, but the wave files enable 
you to add truly obnoxious sounds to a presentation.
Fortunately, the national shortage of sound files ended years ago. PowerPoint 
comes with a handful of useful sound files, including drum rolls, breaking 
glass, gunshots, and typewriter sounds. Windows comes with some useful 
sounds, too. If you have access to the Web, you have a virtually unlimited 
supply of sounds at your disposal. Pop into any of the popular search 
engines (such as www.google.com) and perform a general search, such as 
“WAV file collection,” or a specific search, such as “Star Trek sounds.”

227
 Chapter 16: Lights! Camera! Action! (Adding Sound and Video)
Inserting a sound object
In this section, I explain how to insert a sound object onto a slide. You can 
configure the sound object to play automatically whenever you display the 
slide, or you can set it up so that it will play only when you click the sound 
object’s icon. Note that if you want the sound to play automatically and the 
sound is a WAV file, it’s easier to add it to the slide transition (as described 
in Chapter 10) than to add it as a separate object. If you want to control when 
the sound plays or if the sound file is in a format other than WAV, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Move to the slide to which you want to add the sound.
 
2. Open the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Audio button 
located on the right side of the tab.
 
 The Insert Audio dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
MP3 and the Internet
MP3 files are a compressed form of wave files 
that allow entire songs to be squeezed into a 
reasonable amount of hard drive space. For 
example, the Steppenwolf song, “Wild Thing,” 
weighs in at just under 2.5MB in an MP3 file. The 
same file in WAV format requires a whopping 
26MB — more than ten times the space.
Napster, the online file exchange system that 
let users swap MP3 files, popularized the MP3 
format. Of course, this file swapping bothered 
the music industry, which sued because it said 
users were illegally trading copyrighted music 
without paying for it, which of course they 
were, and we (oops, I mean they) all knew it.
These days, the most popular sources for 
legally obtaining MP3 files are iTunes, Amazon.
com, and Zune.com. You can legally download 
music from these sources, and you can still find 
plenty of online sources to trade music under 
the table. Another popular way to obtain MP3 
files is to rip them from a music CD. Windows 
Media player has the built-in ability to do this.
Keep in mind, however, that the legality of 
using copyrighted music in your PowerPoint 
presentations is questionable. So if you use hot 
MP3 files you got from the Internet or ripped 
from a CD, don’t blame me if one day you wake 
up and find your house surrounded by federal 
agents and CNN news crews, who refer to you 
as a “dangerous copyright abuser” and your 
house as a “compound.” They’ll probably even 
interview your ninth-grade English teacher, 
who will tell the nation that all you could talk 
about when you were a troubled teen was 
stealing Aerosmith music from the Internet and 
using it in illegal PowerPoint presentations.

3. Select the audio file that you want to insert.
 
 You might have to rummage about your hard drive to find the folder 
that contains your sound files. (You can use the Search box on the Start 
menu to search for files in Windows 7.)
 
4. Click the Insert button.
 
 The audio file is inserted into the current slide, along with a toolbar of 
controls that let you play the sound. See Figure 16-2.
 
You can also insert sounds from the Clip Art pane. To do so, click the Clip Art 
Pane button from the Insert menu and then search for the sound you want to 
insert. Double-click the sound to insert it onto the slide.
Here are a few other random thoughts on adding sounds to your slides:
 
✓ To play a sound while working in Normal View, double-click the sound 
icon. However, to play the sound during a slide show, click only once.
 
✓ Remember that you can also play audio files as a part of the slide 
transition. For more information, see Chapter 10.
 
✓ If you change your mind and decide you don’t want any sounds, you can 
easily remove them. To remove a sound, click the sound’s icon (which 
resembles a speaker) and press Delete.

Setting Audio Options
You can control several important aspects of how an audio file is played by 
selecting the file to reveal the Audio Tools contextual tab on the Ribbon and 
then opening the Playback tab, shown in Figure 16-3. As you can see, this tab 
contains several controls that let you edit the way the sound file is played. 
The following sections explain how to use the most important of these tools.
 
Figure 16-3: 
The Audio 
Tools

tab.
 

230
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
Controlling when a sound is played
By default, sounds are not played until you click the sound icon that 
appears on the slide. If you want a sound to play automatically when the 
slide is displayed, change the option in the Start drop-down list (found in 
the Audio Options group on the Audio Tools Playback tab) from On Click to 
Automatically.
If you select On Click or Automatically, the sound automatically stops when 
you move to the next slide. To allow the sound to continue over several 
slides, select the Play Across Slides option from the Start drop-down list.
Looping a sound
If the sound file isn’t long enough, you can loop it so that it plays over and 
over again. This feature is most useful when you have a subtle sound effect, 
such as the sound of waves crashing, that you want to continue for as long 
as you leave the slide visible. To loop an audio clip, just select the Loop Until 
Stopped check box found in the Audio Options group.
Hiding the sound icon
By default, the icon representing an audio clip is visible on the slide during 
your slide show. Assuming that you have set the sound to play automatically, 
you probably don’t want the icon visible.
The Audio Options group includes a check box titled Hide While Not Playing, 
but it hides the icon only when the sound is not playing; the icon is visible 
when the sound is playing.
 
The easiest way to get the icon off of your slides altogether is to simply drag 
the icon off the edge of the slide that contains it. The sound will still be a 
part of the slide, so it will play automatically when the slide is displayed. 
But because the icon is off the edge of the slide, it won’t be visible to your 
audience.
Fading the sound in and out
The Fade In and Fade Out controls let you gradually fade your audio clip in 
and out. By default, these controls are both set to 0, so the audio clip begins 
and ends at full volume. By changing either or both of these controls to a 
value such as 2 or 3 seconds, you can smoothly fade the sound in or out for a 
more subtle effect.

231
 Chapter 16: Lights! Camera! Action! (Adding Sound and Video)
Trimming an audio clip
The Trim Audio button brings up the Trim Audio dialog box, shown in Figure 
16-4. This dialog box allows you to select just a portion of the audio clip to 
play in your presentation by letting you choose start and end times. You can 
choose the start and end times by dragging the green start pointer or the red 
end pointer over the image of the audio file’s waveform. Or, you can enter the 
time (in seconds) in the Start Time and End Time boxes.
 
Figure 16-4:

Adding Video to Your Slides
Welcome to the MTV era of computing. If your computer has the chutzpah, 
you can add small video clips to your presentations and play them at will. I’m 
not sure why you would want to, but hey, who needs a reason?
Adding a movie motion clip to a slide is similar to adding a sound clip. A 
crucial difference exists, however, between motion clips and sound bites: 
Video is meant to be seen (and sometimes heard). An inserted motion clip 
should be given ample space on your slide.
 
If you think sound files are big, wait till you see how big motion clips are. Ha! 
They consume hard drive space the way an elephant consumes veggies. The 
whole multimedia revolution is really a conspiracy started by hard drive man-
ufacturers. (Be aware that you may have trouble sending a PowerPoint pre-
sentation bloated with large video files to your friends and colleagues via e-mail 
because many e-mail servers have limits on the size of e-mail attachments.)
The following steps show you how to add a video clip to a slide:
 
1. Find a good movie and, if needed, download it or upload it to your 
hard drive.
 
 The hardest part about using video in a PowerPoint presentation is find-
ing a video file that’s worth showing. Many good sources offer video clips. 
PowerPoint comes with movies in the Media Gallery, and Microsoft has 
additional movies that you can download from the online Media Gallery. 
You can also find a wide variety of video clips available for download on 
the Web. Or, you can create your own videos using a camcorder.

232
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
2. Move to the slide on which you want to insert the movie.
 
 Hopefully, you left a big blank space on the slide to put the movie in. If 
not, rearrange the existing slide objects to make room for the movie.
 
3. Open the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click Video in the Media 
group.
 
 The Insert Video dialog box appears, shown in Figure 16-5.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Inserting a 
video.
 
 
4. Select the movie that you want to insert.
 
 You might need to scroll the list to find the movie you’re looking for or 
navigate your way to a different folder.
 
5. Click the Insert button.
 
 The movie is inserted on the slide, as shown in Figure 16-6.
 
6. Resize the movie if you want and drag it to a new location on the 
slide.
 
 When you resize the movie, try to do it by using one of the corner 
handles. If you drag one of the side handles, you distort the image.
 
 To play the movie while you’re working on the presentation in Normal 
View, double-click the movie. During a slide show, a single click does the 
trick, unless you set the movie to play automatically. In that case, the 
movie runs as soon as you display the slide.

Playback tab on the Ribbon, shown in Figure 16-7. As you can see, this tab 
contains several controls that let you edit the way the sound file is played.

Controlling when a video is played
By default, videos play when you click the Play button that appears beneath 
the video frame. If you want the video to start automatically when you 
display the slide, change the option in the Start drop-down list (found in 
the Video Options group on the Video Tools Edit tab) from On Click to 
Automatically.
Looping a video
If the video is short, you may want to repeat it over and over again until you 
move to the next slide. To do so, select the Loop Until Stopped check box 
found in the Video Options group.
Trimming a video clip
The Trim Video button summons the Trim Video dialog box, which is shown 
in Figure 16-8. Here, you can select the portion of the video clip you want to 
play in your presentation. You can choose the start and end points of the 
video by dragging the start pointer or the red end pointer over the image of 
the video’s soundtrack wave, which appears immediately beneath the video 
frame. Or, you can enter the time (in seconds) in the Start Time and End 
Time boxes.

 Chapter 16: Lights! Camera! Action! (Adding Sound and Video)
Playing the video full screen
If you want the video to take over the entire screen, select the Play Full 
Screen check box. Note that this option works best for high-quality videos. If 
the video is of lower quality, it may not look good when played in full-screen 
mode.
Fading the video’s sound in and out
The Fade In and Fade Out controls for video clips work just as they do for 
audio clips (described earlier in this chapter). In other words, they affect the 
video’s sound track, not the video image itself. You can use these controls to 
gradually fade the video’s sound in and out.
Adding a bookmark
A bookmark is a marked location within the playback of a video file that 
can be used to trigger an animation effect. For example, a few seconds into 
the video of the Apollo 11 launch shown in the previous two figures, the 
announcer says “Liftoff!” and the rocket begins to rise. It’s a simple matter to 
create a bookmark at that exact point in the video playback. Then, you can 
use that bookmark to trigger an animation that causes the word “Liftoff!” to 
appear beneath the video, as shown in Figure 16-9.
 
Figure 16-9:

bookmark

236
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
Here are the steps for creating a video bookmark and animating an object 
when the video playback reaches the bookmark:
 
1. Add a video to the slide.
 
 For this example, I added a video of the Apollo 11 launch that I downloaded 
from the Internet.
 
2. Select the video object and then select the Video Tools Playback tab.
 
 This tab was shown earlier in Figure 16-7.
 
3. Click the Play button that appears beneath the video frame.
 
 The video begins to play.
 
 
4. When the video reaches the point where you want to insert the 
bookmark, click the Add Bookmark button on the Playback tab 
(shown in the margin).
 
 The bookmark is created; a small dot appears in the progress bar that 
appears beneath the video frame to mark the location of the bookmark.
 
5. Click the Stop button beneath the video frame to stop the video.
 
6. Create an object on the slide that you will animate when the 
bookmark is reached during playback.
 
 For this example, I created a text box with the text “Liftoff!”
 
7. Click the Animations tab.
 
8. Select the object you created in Step 6 and then click the Add 
Animation button in the Animations tab and select the animation 
effect you want.
 
 For this example, I chose the Appear effect to cause the object to 
appear.
 
9. Click the Trigger button on the Animations tab, choose On Bookmark, 
and then choose the bookmark you created in Step 4.
 
 This sets up the animation so it is triggered automatically when the 
bookmark in the video is reached.
 
10. You’re done!
Here are a few additional points to ponder concerning bookmarks:
 
✓ You can create more than one bookmark in a single video. Each 
bookmark can be used as an animation trigger.
 
 
✓ To remove a bookmark, click the small circle that represents the 
bookmark in the video’s slider bar. Then click the Remove Bookmark 
button in the Ribbon (shown in the margin).
 
✓ For more information about creating animations, refer to Chapter 10.

Inserting Tables
Tables are a great way to present lots of information in an orderly fashion. 
For example, if you want to create a slide that shows how many people like 
or hate various computer presentation programs, a table is the way to go. Or 
if you’re considering purchasing some new computer equipment and want to 
list the prices for five different computer configurations from three different 
vendors, a table is the best way.

Creating a table in a Content placeholder
Basic tables are simple to create in PowerPoint. The easiest way to create a 
slide that contains a table is to use the Title and Content slide layout. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Home tab on the Ribbon and then click the New Slide 
button in the Slides group to add a slide with the Title and Content

 A new slide is created.
 
2. Click the Table icon in the center of the Content placeholder.

4. Type information into the table’s cells.
 
 You can click any cell in the table and start typing. Or you can move 
from cell to cell by pressing the Tab key or the arrow keys.
 
5. Play with the formatting if you want.
 
 You can use Table Tools on the Ribbon, described later in this section, 
to control the formatting for the table.

Inserting a table on a slide
You can use the Table button on the Insert tab to insert a table on an existing 
slide. When you click this button, a grid-like menu appears that enables you 
to select the size of the table you want to create, as shown in Figure 17-4. You 
can use this technique to create a table as large as ten columns and eight 
rows.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Inserting a 
table.
 
Drawing a table
A third way to create a table is to use the Draw Table command. The Draw 
Table command lets you draw complicated tables onscreen using a simple 
set of drawing tools. This command is ideal for creating tables that are not 
a simple grid of rows and columns, but rather a complex conglomeration in 
which some cells span more than one row and others span more than one 
column.

241
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
Here’s the procedure for creating a table by using the Draw Table tool:
 
1. On the Insert tab on the Ribbon, click the Table button in the Tables 
group and then choose Draw Table from the menu that appears.
 
 PowerPoint changes the cursor to a little pencil.
 
2. Draw the overall shape of the table by dragging the mouse to create a 
rectangular boundary for the table.
 
 When you release the mouse button, a table with a single cell is created, 
as shown in Figure 17-5. Notice also in this figure that Table Tools is 
displayed on the Ribbon.
 
Figure 17-5: 
Drawing a

3. Click the Draw Table button in the Table Tools Design tab (shown in 
the margin).
 
 
 The mouse pointer changes into a little pencil when you click this 
button.

242
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
4. Carve the table into smaller cells.
 
 To do that, just drag lines across the table. For example, to split the 
table into two rows, point the cursor somewhere along the left edge 
of the table and then click and drag a line across the table to the right 
edge. When you release the mouse button, the table splits into two rows.
 
 You can continue to carve the table into smaller and smaller cells. For 
each slice, point the cursor at one edge of where you want the new cell 
to begin and click and drag to the other edge.
 
5. If you want to change the line size or style drawn for a particular 
segment, use the Pen Style and Pen Weight drop-down controls in the 
Draw Borders group on the Table Tools Design tab.
 
 You can change the style of a line you’ve already drawn by tracing over 
the line with a new style.
 
6. If you make a mistake while drawing the table cells, click the Eraser 
(the one that looks like an eraser) button in the Draw Borders group 
and erase the mistaken line segment.
 
 Or, just press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo button on the Quick Access 
toolbar.
 
 If you want to draw additional segments after using the Erase tool, click 
the Draw Table button.
 
 The most common mistake I make when drawing table cells is to 
accidentally create diagonal borders. If you make this common mistake, 
just press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo button, or use the eraser to erase the 
diagonal border.
 
7. When you’re done, click outside of the table to finish drawing the 
table.
Figure 17-6 shows a table carved up into several cells, with various types of 
line styles and line weights.
Applying style to a table
After you’ve created a table, you can set its style by using the controls under 
Table Tools on the Ribbon. The easiest way to format a table is by applying 
one of PowerPoint’s predefined table styles.
Before you apply a style, however, use the check boxes that appear at the left 
side of the Design tab under Table Tools on the Ribbon. These check boxes 
determine whether PowerPoint uses special formatting for certain parts of 
the table:
 
✓ Header Row: Indicates whether the style should format the first row 
differently than the other rows in the table

243
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
 
✓ Total Row: Indicates whether the style should format the last row 
differently than the other rows in the table
 
✓ Banded Rows: Indicates whether alternating rows should be formatted 
differently
 
✓ First Column: Indicates whether the style should format the first column 
differently than the other column in the table
 
✓ Last Column: Indicates whether the style should format the last column 
differently than the other columns in the table
 
✓ Banded Columns: Indicates whether alternating columns should be 
formatted differently
 
Figure 17-6: 
A finished 
table.
 
After you’ve set the Quick Style options, you can apply a Table Style to the 
table by clicking the style you want to apply (refer to Figure 17-5). If the style 
doesn’t appear in the Table Styles group under Table Tools on the Ribbon, 
click the More button to reveal the Table Styles gallery, shown in Figure 17-7. 
This gallery displays all the built-in styles provided with PowerPoint.
In addition to using one of the preselected table styles, you can format each 
cell and line in your table by using the following controls under Table Tools:
 
 
✓ Shading: Sets the background color for the selected cells.
 
 
✓ Borders: Lets you control which edges of the selected cells have borders.
 
 
✓ Table Effects: Applies bevels, shadows, and reflections. (Note that you 
can apply bevels to individual cells, but shadows and reflections apply

Inserting WordArt
In Chapter 8, you discover how to apply WordArt formatting to any bit of text 
in PowerPoint 2010. WordArt also appears on the Insert tab on the Ribbon, 
which provides a convenient way to insert a text box with text that is already 
formatted with WordArt formatting.
To insert WordArt, follow these steps:
 
1. Move to the slide on which you want to insert WordArt.
 
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the WordArt button 
in the Text group.
 
 A gallery of WordArt styles is displayed, as shown in Figure 17-9.

Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
Using Hyperlinks
In PowerPoint, a hyperlink is simply a bit of text or a graphic image that you 
can click when viewing a slide to summon another slide, another presentation, 
or perhaps some other type of document, such as a Word document or an Excel 
spreadsheet. The hyperlink may also lead to a page on the World Wide Web.
For example, suppose that you have a slide that contains a chart of sales 
trends. You can place a hyperlink on the slide that, if clicked during a slide 
show, summons another slide presenting the same data in the form of a 
table. That slide can in turn contain a hyperlink that, when clicked, summons 
an Excel spreadsheet that contains the detailed data on which the chart is 
based.
Another common use for hyperlinks is to create a table of contents for your 
presentation. You can create a slide — usually the first or second slide in the 
presentation — that contains links to other slides in the presentation. The 
table of contents slide may include a link to every slide in the presentation, but 
more likely, it contains links to selected slides. For example, if a presentation 
contains several sections of slides, the table of contents slide may contain links 
to the first slide in each section.
Hyperlinks are not limited to slides in the current presentation. Hyperlinks 
can lead to other presentations. When you use this kind of hyperlink, a person 
viewing the slide show clicks the hyperlink, and PowerPoint automatically 
loads the indicated presentation. The hyperlink can lead to the first slide in the 
presentation, or it can lead to a specific slide within the presentation.
A common use for this type of hyperlink is to create a menu of presentations 
that can be viewed. For example, suppose that you have created the following 
four presentations:
 
✓ The Detrimental Effects of Pool
 
✓ Case Studies in Communities Destroyed by Pool Halls
 
✓ Marching Bands through the Ages
 
✓ Understanding the Think System
You can easily create a slide listing all four presentations and containing 
hyperlinks to them. The person viewing the slide show simply clicks a 
hyperlink, and off he or she goes to the appropriate presentation.
Here are a few additional thoughts to ponder concerning hyperlinks:

249
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
 
✓ Hyperlinks aren’t limited to PowerPoint presentations. In PowerPoint, 
you can create a hyperlink that leads to other types of Microsoft Office 
documents, such as Word documents or Excel spreadsheets. When the 
person viewing the slide show clicks one of these hyperlinks, 
PowerPoint automatically runs Word or Excel to open the document or 
spreadsheet.
 
✓ A hyperlink can also lead to a page on the World Wide Web. When the 
user clicks the hyperlink, PowerPoint runs Internet Explorer to connect 
to the Internet and displays the Web page.
 
✓ Hyperlinks work only when the presentation is shown in Slide Show 
View. You can click a hyperlink all you want while in Outline View or 
Slide Sorter View, and the only thing that happens is that your finger 
gets tired. Links are active when viewing the slide show. In Normal View, 
you can activate a link by right-clicking it and choosing Open Hyperlink.
Creating a hyperlink to another slide
Adding a hyperlink to a presentation is easy. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text or graphic object that you want to make into a hyperlink.
 
 The most common type of hyperlink is based on a word or two of text in 
a slide’s body text area.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Links➪Hyperlink.
 
 Alternatively, click the Insert Hyperlink button found on the standard 
toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K. One way or the other, the 
Insert Hyperlink dialog box, shown in Figure 17-11, is summoned.
 
Figure 17-11: 
The Insert 
Hyperlink 
dialog box.
 

250
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
 The dialog box has four icons on the left side, as follows:
 
• Existing File or Web Page: This means you can link to another file in 
another application, or to a Web page on the Internet.
 
• Place in This Document: This means you can link one part of your 
PowerPoint presentation to another part.
 
• Create New Document: This is just what it says it is. You can, 
however, choose now or another time to edit the new document by 
clicking the appropriate button.
 
• E-mail Address: Use this to link to an e-mail address. This feature is 
useful in an intranet or Internet setting because this link allows the 
reader to write an e-mail to the e-mail address that you link to.
 
3. Click the Place in This Document icon on the left side of the dialog box.
 
 A list of the slides in the current presentation appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click the slide that you want the hyperlink to lead to and then click OK.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box vanishes, and the hyperlink is created.
If you selected text in Step 1, the text changes color and is underlined. If 
you selected a graphical object, the picture isn’t highlighted in any way to 
indicate that it is a hyperlink. However, the cursor always changes to a 
pointing hand whenever it passes over a hyperlink in Slide Show View or 
Reading View, thus providing a visual clue that the user has found a hyperlink.
Creating a hyperlink to another 
presentation or to a Web site
Creating a hyperlink that opens another presentation is much like the 
procedure described in the preceding section, “Creating a hyperlink to 
another slide,” but with a couple important differences:
 
1. Select the text or graphical object that you want to make into a 
hyperlink.
 
2. Click the Hyperlink button in the Links group on the Insert tab.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-11).
 
3. Click the Existing File or Web Page icon in the list of icons on the left 
side of the dialog box.
 
 You can also link to a specific slide within another presentation by 
clicking the Bookmark button in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box. 
This brings up another dialog box listing the slides in the selected 
presentation. Choose the slide you want to link to; then click OK to 
return to the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.

251
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
 
4. Click Current Folder.
 
5. Select the file that you want to link to.
 
 You might have to rummage about your hard drive to find the 
presentation.
 
 The presentation that you link to doesn’t have to be in the same folder 
or even on the same drive as the current presentation. In fact, you can 
link to a presentation that resides on a network file server.
 
6. Click OK.
When you follow a link to another presentation, PowerPoint automatically 
opens the other presentation. This means that you now have both presentations 
open. When you’re finished viewing the second presentation, close it to 
return to the original presentation.
If you want to create a hyperlink to an existing Web page, just type the 
address of the Web page in your outline or on your slide and a hyperlink 
automatically appears. You can select any page of a Web site as long as you 
know the URL for that specific page.
 
To remove a hyperlink, right-click the hyperlink that you want to zap and then 
choose Remove Hyperlink from the menu that appears. To change a hyperlink, 
right-click it and choose Edit Hyperlink.
Adding Action Buttons
An action button is a special type of AutoShape that places a button on the 
slide. When the user clicks the button during a slide show, PowerPoint takes 
whatever action you’ve designated for the button. A well-planned arrangement 
of action buttons scattered throughout a presentation can make it easy for 
someone to view the presentation in any order he or she wants.
The following sections describe how action buttons work and show you how 
to add them to your presentations.
Assigning button actions
When you create an action button, you assign both a shape for the button 
(you have 12 shapes to choose from; the shapes are described a bit later in 
this section) and an action to be taken when the user clicks the button or 
merely points the cursor at it. The action for a button can be any of the 
following:

252
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Activate a hyperlink: This is the most common button action. It causes 
a different slide in the current presentation, a different presentation 
altogether, a non-PowerPoint document, or even an Internet Web page 
to appear.
 
✓ Run a program: For example, you can set up a button that runs 
Microsoft Word or Excel.
 
✓ Run a macro: PowerPoint lets you create macros, which are programs 
written in a powerful programming language called Visual Basic for 
Applications.
 
✓ Play a sound: This is just one way to add sound to a PowerPoint 
presentation. For more ways, refer to Chapter 16.
Choosing button shapes
PowerPoint provides a selection of built-in shapes for action buttons. Table 
17-2 lists the action button shapes that you can place in your presentation 
and indicates what type of action is associated with each type.

Creating a button
To add a button to a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Move to the slide on which you want to place a button.
 
2. Open the Insert tab on the Ribbon, click the Shapes button in the 
Illustrations group, and choose one of the Action Button shapes found 
at the bottom of the gallery that appears.
 
3. Draw the button on the slide.
 
 Start by pointing to the spot where you want the upper-left corner of the 
button to appear. Then click and drag to where you want the lower-right 
corner of the button to appear.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the Action Settings dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 17-12.
 
Figure 17-12: 
The Action 
Settings 
dialog box.
 

254
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
4. If you want, change the action settings for the action button.
 
 In most cases, the default setting for the action button that you chose is 
appropriate for what you want the button to do. For example, the action 
setting for a Forward or Next button is Hyperlink to Next Slide. If you 
want the slide to hyperlink to some other location, change the Hyperlink 
To setting.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Action Settings dialog box vanishes, and the button is created.
Here are some additional thoughts concerning action buttons:
 
✓ Change the look of a button: You can format action buttons like any 
other shape object. That means you can use Drawing Tools on the 
Ribbon to apply fill colors, line styles, or shape effects such as bevels 
and 3-D rotations. For more information, refer to Chapter 13.
 
✓ Move a button: To move a button, just click it to select it. Then use the 
mouse to drag the button to a new location.
 
✓ Change the action setting for a button: You can change the action 
setting for a button by right-clicking the button and choosing the Action 
Settings command.
Creating a navigation toolbar
Grouping action buttons into a navigation toolbar makes a slide show easy 
to navigate. You can add a set of navigation buttons to the bottom of your 
Slide Master. Figure 17-13 shows a slide with navigation buttons in the lower-
right corner. These buttons make getting around the show a snap. For this 
example, I use Beginning, Backward (Previous), Forward (Next), and Ending 
buttons, but you can include any buttons you want.
To create a navigation toolbar that appears on every slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master View.
 
 From the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Slide Master button in the 
Presentation Views group. Or if you like shortcuts, hold down the Shift 
key and click the Normal View button in the lower-left corner of the 
PowerPoint window.
 
2. Create the action buttons that you want to include.
 
 Follow the procedure described in the preceding section, “Creating a 
button,” to create each button. Make sure that all the buttons are the 
same size and line them up to create a tight cluster of buttons.

255
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
 
Figure 17-13: 
A slide with 
navigation 
buttons.
 
 
 You can easily duplicate a button by holding down the Ctrl key while 
you drag the button to a new location. This technique makes it easy to 
create several similar buttons such as navigation buttons.
 
3. Return to Normal View.
 
 Click the Normal View button or click the Normal button in the 
Presentation Views group on the View tab.
The buttons that you created appear on every slide in your presentation.
Inserting Equations
Steven Hawking has said that his editor told him that every mathematical 
equation he included in his classic book A Brief History of Time would cut the 
book’s sales in half. So he included just one: the classic e=mc2. See how easy 
that equation was to type? The only trick was remembering how to format 
the little 2 as a superscript.

256
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
My editor promised me that every equation I included in this book would 
double its sales, but I didn’t believe her, not even for a nanosecond. Just in 
case, Figure 17-14 shows some examples of the equations you can create by 
using PowerPoint’s handy-dandy Equation feature. You wouldn’t even con-
sider using ordinary text to try to create these equations, but they took me 
only a few minutes to create with the Equation tool. Aren’t they cool? Tell all 
your friends about the cool equations you saw in this book so that they’ll all 
rush out and buy copies for themselves.
 
Figure 17-14: 
These 
equations 
will 
probably 
not affect 
the sales 
of this book 
one way or 
another.
 
You don’t have to know anything about math to use PowerPoint. I don’t have 
a clue what most of the equations in Figure 17-14 do, but they sure look great, 
don’t they?
 
Don’t forget to tell your friends how great the equations in Figure 17-14 are. 
Those alone are worth the price of the book.
To add an equation to a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Call up the Insert tab of the Ribbon and then click the Equation 
button to reveal the gallery of equations, as shown in Figure 17-15.

257
 Chapter 17: More Things to Insert on Your Slides
 
Figure 17-15: 
Inserting an 
equation.
 
 
2. If one of the preformatted equations in the gallery meets your needs, 
select it. Otherwise choose Insert New Equation found at the bottom of 
the gallery.
 
 The rest of this procedure assumes you’ve chosen to insert a new equation. 
A placeholder for the equation appears in the slide, and the Equation 
Tools Design tab appears on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 17-16.
 
3. Start typing your equation.
 
 PowerPoint watches any text you type in an equation and does its level 
best to figure out how the text should be formatted. If you type the letter 
x, for example, PowerPoint assumes that you intend for it to be a vari-
able, so the x is displayed in italics. If you type cos, PowerPoint assumes 
that you mean the cosine function, so the text is not italicized. If you use 
the mathematical operators +, –, *, and /, PowerPoint will automatically 
format them using the equivalent equation symbols.
 
 Don’t worry about how the equation is formatted; when you press Enter, 
PowerPoint formats the equation automatically. For example, suppose 
you enter the following:
 
 a = (b + 2c) / 2b
 
 When you press Enter, the equation is formatted as follows:
 
 

258
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
Figure 17-16: 
Creating 
a new 
equation
 
 
4. To add a symbol that’s not on the keyboard, use one of the buttons in 
the Symbols section of the Equation Tools Design tab.
 
 The Symbols section contains a gallery of mathematical symbols most of 
which only Robert Oppenheimer could understand. To use this gallery, 
first click the More button in the bottom-right corner of the Symbols 
section. Then choose the symbol category from the drop-down menu 
that appears at the top of the gallery. For example, Figure 17-17 shows 
the Operators gallery. Additional galleries contain basic math symbols, 
Greek letters, negated relations, and other obscure symbols.
 
5. To create symbols stacked upon each other in various ways, use the 
controls in the Structures section of the Equation Tools Design tab.
 
 Each button in the Structures section reveals a gallery of structures that 
you can use to create equations with stacked symbols. Most structures 
include a symbol and one or more slots, in which you type text or insert 
other symbols or other structures. For example, Figure 17-18 shows 
the gallery of templates that are displayed when you click the Radical 
button. These structures let you insert a square-root sign along with 
slots in front of and inside the sign.

The 
Operators 
symbol 
gallery.

structures

6. When you’re done, click outside of the equation to return to the slide.
Confused? I don’t blame you. After you latch on to the idea behind structures, 
you can slap together even the most complex equations in no time. But the 
learning curve here is steep. Stick with it.
Here are a few additional points to keep in mind when editing equations:
 
✓ Spend some time exploring the symbols and structures available on 
the Equation Tools Design tab. There’s enough stuff here to create a 
presentation on how to build your own atomic bomb. (None of the 
equations in Figure 17-14 have anything to do with atomic bombs. 
Honest.)

260
Part III: Embellishing Your Slides 
 
✓ Don’t use the spacebar to separate elements in an equation — let 
PowerPoint worry about how much space to leave between the variables 
and the plus signs. The only time you should use the spacebar is when 
you’re typing two or more words of text and you need the space to 
separate the words.
 
✓ The Enter key has an interesting behavior in an equation: It adds a new 
equation slot, immediately beneath the current slot. This technique is 
sometimes a good way to create stacked items.
 
✓ The denominator is the bottom part of a fraction, not an Arnold 
Schwarzenegger movie.

Part IV
Working with 
Others

In this part . . .
R
emember, there is no I in PowerPoint. Well, I guess 
there is. But there’s only one. That being said, many 
PowerPoint presentations are crafted by teams of people 
rather than by individuals. So, the chapters in this part 
focus on those features of PowerPoint that are designed 
with teamwork in mind. So get out there and collaborate! 

Chapter 18
Using PowerPoint’s 
Collaboration Tools
In This Chapter
▶ Sending your presentation via e-mail
▶ Adding comments to a presentation
▶ Comparing changes in a revised version of a presentation
▶ Co-authoring a presentation
▶ Sending your presentation on a CD
▶ Broadcasting your slide show to remote viewers
“W
orks well with others” is more than standard fare for rookie 
resumes. It’s also one of the PowerPoint mantras. Many 
presentations are designed not by and for a single presenter, but by a team 
of presenters. Fortunately, PowerPoint includes several simple tools that let 
you distribute your presentation to others and allow others to add comments 
to the presentation so you can get their feedback. This chapter shows you 
how to use those features.
E-Mailing a Presentation
The first step in working on a team PowerPoint project is figuring out how to 
get a copy of the presentation to your teammates. If all your collaborators 
share a common location to access the presentation — such as a shared 
network location or a SharePoint or Windows Live site — you can do that by 
saving the presentation to the shared location. But if your collaborators don’t 
all have access to a shared location, your next best bet is to e-mail copies of 
the presentation to your colleagues for their review. PowerPoint includes a 
built-in feature for doing that. Here are the steps:

264
Part IV: Working with Others 
 
1. Open the presentation that you want to send out for review.
 
 If the presentation is already open, choose File➪Save to save any 
changes you made since you opened it.
 
2. Choose File➪Save and Send➪Send Using E-mail.
 
 PowerPoint displays a Backstage View screen that provides five options 
for sending the file, as shown in Figure 18-1. The five options are
 
• Attach a Copy of This Presentation to an E-Mail: This is the most 
commonly used option. It simply creates an e-mail message with 
the presentation file inserted as an attachment.
 
• Create an E-Mail That Contains a Link to This Presentation: This 
option works only if you’ve saved the presentation to a Web 
server. It then creates an e-mail that contains a link that the 
recipient can click to open the presentation.
 
• Attach a PDF Copy of This Presentation to an E-Mail: This option 
creates a PDF version of the presentation, and then creates an 
e-mail that contains the PDF version as an attachment.
 
• Attach a XPS Copy of This Presentation to an E-Mail: This option 
creates an XPS version of the presentation (XPS is Microsoft’s 
attempt at competing with PDF) and then creates an e-mail that 
contains the XPS version as an attachment.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Sending a 
presentation 
via e-mail.
 

265
 Chapter 18: Using PowerPoint’s Collaboration Tools
 
• Send as Internet Fax: If you have an account with an Internet fax 
service, you can use this option to send a fax of your presentation. 
(This option would be more useful in today’s world if it could also 
send your presentation back in time, so that, for example, the 
recipient would receive the fax in 1983 — when faxing was popular.)
 
3. Click the option you want to use to send the e-mail.
 
 Outlook fires up and creates an e-mail message with the correct 
attachment or link, depending on which option you choose.
 
4. In the To field, add an e-mail address for each person to whom you 
want to send a review copy.
 
 You can type the e-mail addresses directly into the To field, or you can 
click the To button to call up the Address Book. You can then use the 
Address Book to select your reviewers.
 
 If you want to send the presentation to more than one person, separate 
the e-mail addresses with semicolons.
 
5. If you want, change the Subject field or message body.
 
 By default, PowerPoint uses the filename as the message’s subject and 
leaves the message body blank. You probably want to say something a 
little more cordial.
 
6. Set any other e-mail options you want for the message.
 
 Depending on the program you use for your email, you have a bevy of 
options to set for e-mail messages, such as high or low priority, signatures, 
stationery, read receipts, plain or HTML formatting, and more.
 
7. Click the Send button.
 
 Your message is whisked away and will be delivered as soon as possible.
Using Comments
If you’re reviewing a presentation, one of the best ways to communicate your 
thoughts to your colleagues is to insert comments into the presentation. A 
comment is a lot like a sticky note. (I’d call it a Post-It note, but then I’d have 
to remember the Word command to generate the little registered trademark 
symbol so the folks at 3M won’t sue me. Oh, in case any 3M lawyers are 
reading: “Post-It is a registered trademark of the 3M corporation.”)
The beauty of comments is that you can turn them on and off. Thus you can 
view the comments while you’re editing your presentation, and you can turn 
them off when it’s time for the show.

266
Part IV: Working with Others 
To add a comment to a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Call up the slide to which you want to add a comment.
 
2. Click where you want the comment to appear.
 
 You can click anywhere in the slide.
 
3. Open the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the New Comment 
button.
 
 A comment bubble appears on the slide. Your initials and a comment 
number appear in the small box next to the bubble.
 
4. Type whatever you want in the comment bubble.
 
 Offer some constructive criticism. Suggest an alternative approach. Or 
just comment on the weather. Figure 18-2 shows a completed comment.
 
Figure 18-2: 
Creating a 
comment.
 
 
5. Click anywhere outside the comment bubble to make it disappear.
 
 Only the comment tag (the little box with the reviewer’s initials and 
comment number) remains.
 
6. If you want, move the comment tag.
 
 You can move the comment closer to the slide item on which you’re 
commenting by dragging the comment tag around the slide.
Here are some additional thoughts concerning working with comments:
 
✓ To view a comment, click the comment tag.
 
✓ To change a comment, double-click the comment tag and then edit the 
text in the comment until you’re satisfied.
 
✓ You can move a comment by dragging it. Note that comments are not 
attached to any particular slide object or text. Thus if you move a 
comment near the text or object that the comment applies to and then 
edit the slide so that the text or object moves, the comment will not 
move along with the text or object. You have to manually move the 
comment if you want it to stay near the text or object it applies to.

267
 Chapter 18: Using PowerPoint’s Collaboration Tools
 
✓ To delete a comment, click the comment to select it and then press 
Delete.
 
✓ To delete all of the comments on a particular slide, click the down arrow 
beneath the Delete button on the Review tab. Then choose Delete All

Presentation.
 
✓ You can quickly scan through all the comments in a PowerPoint 
presentation by using the Previous and Next buttons on the Review tab 
on the Ribbon.
 
✓ You can use the Show Markup button on the Review tab to show or hide 
comments from a presentation.
Comparing Presentations
The new Compare feature lets you compare the differences between two 
versions of a presentation and accept or reject the differences. This feature is 
useful if you’ve sent a copy of the presentation to a reviewer and you want to 
selectively incorporate the reviewer’s changes.
Using the Compare feature is easy. Here are the steps:
 
1. Open the original version of the presentation.
 
2. On the Reviewing tab of the Ribbon, click the Compare button.
 
 This brings up a dialog box that lets you open the revised version of the 
presentation.
 
3. Navigate to the revised version of the presentation, select it, and click 
Open.
 
 This action opens the revised version of the presentation and merges 
the two presentations together, keeping track of the differences between 
the original presentation and the revised version.
 
 The differences between the original and the revised versions are 
highlighted as shown in Figure 18-3. As you can see, the revisions are 
shown as check boxes, which allow you to select the individual changes 
you want to accept or reject. You can also select the All Changes . . . 
check box to accept or reject all of the changes for a given object.

4. Use the check boxes to select the changes you want to accept or reject; 
then click either Accept or Reject on the Review tab of the Ribbon.
 
 If you click Accept, the selected changes are incorporated into the 
drawing. If you click Reject, the original version of the selected changes 
is restored.
 
5. Click the Next button found in the Compare section of the Review tab 
to move to the next set of edits.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have accepted or rejected all the edits 
to the presentation.
 
7. Click the End Review button (in the Compare group of the Review tab 
of the Ribbon) when you’re finished.
 
 This step hides any remaining edits that you haven’t yet accepted or 
rejected.
 
8. Save the presentation.

 Chapter 18: Using PowerPoint’s Collaboration Tools
Co-Authoring a PowerPoint Presentation
One of the most interesting new collaboration features of PowerPoint 2010 
is co-authoring, which allows two or more users to edit a presentation at 
the same time. To use this feature, the presentation must be stored on a 
SharePoint 2010 server or on Windows Live. For more information about 
SharePoint, please refer to SharePoint 2010 For Dummies by Vanessa L. 
Williams.
Co-authoring a PowerPoint presentation stored on SharePoint 2010 or 
Windows Live is easy. Whenever two or more people open a PowerPoint file 
from one of these locations, the co-authoring feature kicks in. Note that any 
changes you make to the presentation will not be visible to your co-authors 
until you save your changes using the normal Save command. Likewise, you 
won’t be able to see any of your co-authors’ changes until they save their 
versions.
Co-authoring works best when the co-authors work on entirely separate parts 
of the presentation. You wouldn’t want to have two people working on the 
same part of the same slide at the same time, and in fact PowerPoint won’t 
allow it: The specific part of the presentation you are editing at any given 
moment is locked to prevent other users from editing it.
Packaging Your Presentation on a CD
Often, you may need to share a PowerPoint presentation with someone 
who doesn’t own a copy of PowerPoint. Fortunately, PowerPoint includes a 
Package for CD command that creates a CD with the presentation and a 
special program called the PowerPoint Viewer that can display the 
presentation on a computer that doesn’t have PowerPoint installed.
 
Unfortunately, the PowerPoint Viewer program that’s placed on the CD isn’t 
able to display all the features of PowerPoint 2010 presentations with the 
same quality that PowerPoint 2010 displays them. As a result, your presentation 
may look slightly different when you view it with the PowerPoint Viewer.
To create a CD with your presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the presentation in PowerPoint and then choose File➪Save and 
Send➪Package Presentation for CD. Then click the Package for CD 
button.
 
 The Package for CD dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-4.

270
Part IV: Working with Others 
 
Figure 18-4: 
The 
Package for 
CD dialog 
box.
 
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 This step summons the Options dialog box, shown in Figure 18-5.
 
Figure 18-5: 
The Options 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Look over the options and change any that aren’t set the way you 
want.
 
 The following list describes each of the options that are available:
 
• Linked Files: Select this option to include any linked files, such as 
videos or large audio files.
 
• Embedded TrueType Fonts: Select this option to ensure that the 
fonts you use in your presentation will be available when you show 
the presentation on another computer.
 
• Password to Open Each Presentation: Enter a password if the 
presentation contains top-secret information, such as the true 
whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa.
 
• Password to Modify Each Presentation: Enter a password if you want 
to prevent unauthorized people from changing the presentation.
 
• Inspect Presentations for Inappropriate or Private Information: Sorry, 
this option doesn’t check your presentation for off-color jokes or 
naughty pictures. Instead, it checks for any personal information 
that might be embedded in your presentation.

271
 Chapter 18: Using PowerPoint’s Collaboration Tools
 
4. Click OK to return to the Package for CD dialog box.
 
5. If you want to add other presentations to the CD, click Add Files, 
select the files that you want to add, and then click Add.
 
 You can put as many files as will fit on the CD. You can add other 
PowerPoint presentations or any other files you’d like to add to the CD, 
such as Word documents or text files.
 
6. Click Copy to CD.
 
 If you haven’t already inserted a blank CD into the drive, you’re 
prompted to insert one now. Go ahead and insert a blank CD when 
prompted.
 
 PowerPoint copies the files to the CD. This might take a few minutes, so 
now is a good time to catch a few z’s. When the CD is finished, the drive 
spits it out and asks whether you want to make another copy.
 
7. Remove the CD and then click Yes if you want to make another copy. 
Otherwise, click No and then click Close.
 
 You’re done!
The CD is set up so that the presentation should start running all by itself 
when you insert it into a computer. If it doesn’t, open a My Computer 
window and then open the CD drive and double-click pptview.exe. A list of 
presentations on the CD appears. Double-click the one that you want to run, 
and off you go.
Broadcasting Your Presentation
PowerPoint 2010 includes a feature called Presentation Broadcast that lets 
you share a live slide show of your presentation with anyone on the Internet. 
Your viewers can follow along in a Web browser as you present your slide 
show.
To use this feature, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Broadcast Slide Show button in the Slide Show Ribbon tab 
(shown in the margin).
 
 This brings up the dialog box shown in Figure 18-6.
 
2. Click Start Broadcast.
 
 PowerPoint connects to the broadcast service and prepares your pre-
sentation for broadcast. After a few moments, the dialog box shown in 
Figure 18-7 appears.

Figure 18-7: 
The show is 
ready to be 
broadcast.
 
 
3. Send the link shown in the dialog box to your viewers and wait for 
them to open the link.
 
 The easiest way to share the link is to click Send in Email, which adds 
the link to an e-mail message. You can then add the e-mail addresses of 
your viewers and then send the message.
 
 When your viewers receive the e-mail message, they should open the 
link in their Web browsers to view the show. When they open the link, 
your viewers are taken to a page similar to the one shown in Figure 18-8.
 
4. After all of your viewers have opened the link, click the Start Slide 
Show button in the Broadcast Slide Show dialog box.
 
 This begins the slide show and the broadcast.
 
5. Present your slide show.
 
 Once you begin, your viewers see the slide show in their browser 
windows, as shown in Figure 18-9.

Chapter 19
Using a Slide Library and Other 
Ways to Reuse Slides
In This Chapter
▶ Stealing slides from another presentation
▶ Saving slides in a slide library
▶ Stealing slides from a slide library
W
hat do you do when you’re plodding along in PowerPoint and realize 
that the slides you’re trying to create probably already exist in some 
other presentation somewhere? You do what I do: You borrow the slides 
from the other presentation. This chapter shows you how to do that.
Note that in the old days, the only way to steal slides from another presentation 
was to get on your horse and chase down the other presentation (that is, 
find the presentation on your hard drive), jump on board (open the 
presentation), and steal the slides at gunpoint (copy the slides you want to 
steal and paste them into the new presentation).
You can still steal slides that way — in fact, Microsoft has created a special 
command that makes it easy to steal slides directly from another presentation. 
But if you steal slides often and want to become a career criminal, the real 
way to do it is to set up a slide library, which is a central repository for slides. 
The slide library lives on a server, so anyone can access it, and it’s managed 
by SharePoint so it has a bunch of nice SharePoint-like features.
Stealing Slides from Another 
Presentation
Stealing slides from another presentation isn’t a serious crime. In fact, 
Microsoft provides a special command on the Insert tab on the Ribbon to let 
you do it. Here are the steps:

276
Part IV: Working with Others 
 
1. Open the presentation you want to copy slides into (not the one you 
want to steal the slides from).
 
2. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon and then click the New Slide button 
and choose Reuse Slides. (Reuse Slides appears at the bottom of the 
New Slide menu.)
 
 This step displays a Reuse Slides task pane, which appears on the right 
side of the screen as shown in Figure 19-1.
 
Figure 19-1: 
The Reuse 
Slides task 
pane lets 
you steal 
slides from 
other pre-
sentations.
 
 
3. Click the Open a PowerPoint File link in the Reuse Slides task pane.
 
 This summons a Browse dialog box.
 
4. Locate the presentation you want to steal slides from and then click 
Open.
 
 The slides from the presentation you selected are displayed in the Reuse 
Slides task pane, as shown in Figure 19-2.
 
 You’re now privy to one of the coolest effects in PowerPoint: When 
you point at one of the slides in the Reuse Slides task pane, the slide 
magnifies to twice its original size so you can better see the contents of 
the slide.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Keep Source Formatting check box if you want 
the slides to retain their original formatting.
 
 Normally, you should keep this option deselected. With the option 
deselected, the slide assumes the theme of the presentation it is 
inserted into.

277
 Chapter 19: Using a Slide Library and Other Ways to Reuse Slides
 
Figure 19-2:

slides!
 
 
6. Click the slides you want to steal.
 
 Each slide you click is added to the presentation.
 
7. When you’re done, click the X at the top right of the Reuse Slides task 
pane to dismiss it.
That’s about all there is to stealing slides from other presentations.
Saving Slides in a Slide Library
If you’re lucky enough to work at a company that uses SharePoint, you have 
several additional PowerPoint features at your disposal. One of the most 
useful is the ability to create and use slide libraries, which are special types 
of document folders that store individual slides, not whole documents. 
When you’ve saved slides in a slide library, you can easily insert them into 
a presentation. And as an added bonus, you can have PowerPoint check to 
see whether the slides have changed and automatically update them with the 
changes. Pretty cool, eh?
To save one or more slides to a slide library, you must first create the slide 
library. That’s a task better left to a SharePoint system administrator, so you 
can skip that step here. Instead, assume that the slide library has already 
been created for you, and you’ve been provided with the URL (that is, the 
Web address) of the slide library and any login credentials you might need to 
access it.

278
Part IV: Working with Others 
Here are the steps for adding slides to a slide library:
 
1. Open the presentation that contains the slides you want to add to the 
library.
 
2. Choose File➪Save and Send➪Publish Slides; then click the Publish 
Slides button.
 
 This step brings up the dialog box shown in Figure 19-3.
 
Figure 19-3: 
The Publish 
Slides 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Select the slides you want to add to the library.
 
 To select an individual slide, select the check box next to the slide 
thumbnail. To select all of the slides in the presentation, click the Select 
All button.
 
4. Enter the URL of the slide library in the Publish To text box.
 
 Or if you prefer, you can click the Browse button to browse to the 
library.
 
5. Click the Publish button.
 
 The slides are copied to the slide library.

279
 Chapter 19: Using a Slide Library and Other Ways to Reuse Slides
 
6. Play a game of Solitaire.
 
 Depending on the speed of your local network and how many slides you 
selected, PowerPoint might take a while to publish the slides (probably 
not long enough for a game of Solitaire, but your boss doesn’t have to 
know that).
 
7. You’re done!
The slides have now been added to the library.
Stealing Slides from a Slide Library
To incorporate a slide from a SharePoint slide library into a presentation, just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open the presentation you want to copy slides into (not the one you 
want to steal the slides from).
 
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Add Slide button 
and choose Reuse Slides.
 
 This step displays a Reuse Slides task pane, shown earlier in Figure 19-1.
 
3. Click the Open a Slide Library link in the Reuse Slides task pane.
 
 This step summons a Browse dialog box.
 
4. Locate the Slide Library you want to steal slides from and then click 
Open.
 
 The slides from the presentation you selected are displayed in the Reuse 
Slides task pane, in the same way that slides from a PowerPoint file are 
shown. Refer to Figure 19-2.
 
5. (Optional) To keep the original formatting for the slides, select the 
Keep Source Formatting check box.
 
 Normally, you should keep this option deselected.
 
6. Click the slides you want to steal.
 
 Each slide you click is added to the presentation.
 
7. When you’re done, click the X at the top right of the Reuse Slides task 
pane to dismiss it.

Chapter 20
Creating a Video Version of 
Your Presentation
In This Chapter
▶ Adding timings and narration to your presentation
▶ Creating a presentation video
▶ Watching the presentation
P
owerPoint is great for preparing presentations to give in person. But 
what about giving presentations when you can’t be there? With digital 
video cameras practically being given away in cereal boxes these days, just 
about anyone can record a video of himself giving a presentation. Wouldn’t it 
be great if you could easily combine the slides from a PowerPoint presentation 
with a video of you presenting it? Then anyone can watch the presentation 
later, when you can’t be there.
Good news! Beginning with PowerPoint 2010, you can! In fact, creating a video 
version of your presentation is a snap. First, you set up the timing you want 
for each slide and for each animation within each slide. You can even add a 
voice narration to each slide. After the timings and narration are all set up, 
you just click a few times with the mouse, and your presentation is converted 
to video.
Adding Timings and Narration
PowerPoint includes a nifty feature that lets you record the timings for each 
slide and for each animation element (such as bullet points appearing). At 
the same time, you can record your own voice to use as a narration for the 
presentation.
To record the timings, you essentially rehearse the presentation as if you 
were giving it to an audience. PowerPoint keeps track of the time between 
each mouse click or other action and records those timings along with the 
presentation.

282
Part IV: Working with Others 
As for the narration, you simply speak your narration into a microphone, and 
PowerPoint attaches your recorded voice to each slide. Then, when you play 
back the presentation, the slides are automatically synchronized with the 
narrations you recorded.
Note that you can also record PowerPoint’s built-in laser pointer. Then, when 
you play back the show or create a video, the pointer will dance across the 
screen automatically! For more information about using the laser pointer, 
refer to Chapter 6.
 
You’ll need a microphone plugged into your computer to record narrations. 
I recommend you get the kind that’s built in to a headset rather than a hand-
held microphone. The headset microphone will provide more consistent voice 
quality, plus it will leave your hands free to work your keyboard and mouse 
while you record the timings, narration, and laser pointer.
To record timings and narration, first plug a microphone into your computer’s 
microphone input jack. Then, open the presentation and follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Slide Show tab, choose Record Slide Show and then choose 
Start Recording from Beginning.
 
 The Record Slide Show dialog box, shown in Figure 20-1, appears. 
This dialog box simply asks whether you want to record slide timings or 
narration.
 
Figure 20-1: 
Specify 
what 
elements 
you want to 
record.
 
 
2. To record slide timings, select the Slide and Animation Timings check 
box. To record narrations and the laser pointer, select the Narrations 
and Laser Pointer check box.
 
 You’ll almost always want to select the Slide and Animation Timings 
check box. Select the Narrations and Laser Pointer check box only if you 
want to add your voice narration, the laser pointer, or both.
 
 If you don’t want to record a narration but you would still like the laser 
pointer to appear in your final video, select the Narrations and Laser 
Pointer check box. Then, in Step 4, just skip the part about speaking into 
the microphone.

283
 Chapter 20: Creating a Video Version of Your Presentation
 
3. Click OK to begin recording the slide show.
 
 The first slide of your presentation is displayed, and a small toolbar 
titled Record Slide Show is displayed, as shown in Figure 20-2.
 
Figure 20-2: 
The Record

toolbar.
 
 
4. Speak your narration into the microphone. Press Enter or click the 
mouse button each time you want to advance to a new slide or call up 
a new animation element (such as a bullet point).
 
5. If you want to use the laser pointer on a slide, hold down the Ctrl 
key and then click and hold the mouse button and use the mouse to 
control the laser pointer.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the laser pointer disappears. (For 
more information about working the laser pointer, see Chapter 6.)
 
6. If you need to pause the recording at any time, click the Pause button 
that appears in the Record Slide Show toolbar.
 
 The recording is suspended, and a dialog box appears with a button that 
lets you resume the recording. When you’re ready to continue, click this 
button.
 
7. When you’re finished recording, press Esc.
 
 PowerPoint ends the recording and switches to Slide Sorter View, which 
displays the timings associated with each slide, as shown in Figure 20-3.
 
8. If you messed up on any slide, select that slide, click Record Slide 
Show and then choose Start Recording from Current Slide. Then 
re-record the timings and narration for that slide. Press Esc to stop 
recording.
 
 You can re-record more than one slide in this way; just press Enter or 
click the mouse to advance through all the slides you want to re-record. 
Press Esc to stop recording.
 
9. Press F5 or click the Slide Show button on the right side of the status 
bar to begin the slide show so you can see whether your narration 
works.
 
 The slide show begins. The narration plays through your computer’s 
speakers, and the slides advance automatically along with the narration. 
The laser pointer should also appear if you used it during the recording.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about narrations:
 
✓ As you record the narration, leave a little gap between each slide. 
PowerPoint records the narration for each slide as a separate sound file 
and then attaches the sound to the slide. Unfortunately, you get cut off if 
you talk right through the slide transitions.
 
✓ The narration cancels out any other sounds you placed on the slides.
 
✓ To delete a narration, click the Record Slide Show button, click Clear, 
and then click either Clear Narrations on Current Slide (to delete 
narration from just one slide) or Clear Narration on All Slides (to delete 
all narration).
Creating a Video
Creating a video from your presentation couldn’t be much easier. Here’s the 
procedure:
 
1. (Optional) Record the slide timings and any narration you want to use.
 
 For the procedure to record timings and narration, refer to the previous 
section. If you skip this step, each slide will be displayed for a fixed 
duration in the resulting video.

285
 Chapter 20: Creating a Video Version of Your Presentation
 
2. Click the File button, click Save and Send, and then click Create a 
Video.
 
 The Create a Video Backstage View screen is displayed, as shown in 
Figure 20-4.
 
3. Select the video quality.
 
 The quality drop-down control lets you choose High Quality, Medium 
Quality, or Low Quality. High Quality is intended for recording to a DVD 
so it can be played back at the highest possible resolution. This option 
results in the largest video file sizes. Low Quality results in smaller video 
files, but the quality is low — suitable for viewing over the Internet. 
Medium quality is in-between.
 
4. Select whether to use recorded timings and narrations.
 
 If you choose not to use recorded timings, you can set the duration to 
display each slide. (The default is 5 seconds.)
 
5. Click Create Video.
 
 A Save As dialog box appears.
 
6. Select the folder where you want to save the file and enter the filename 
you want to use.
 
 By default, the video file will be saved in the same folder as the 
presentation and will have the same name, but with the extension .wmv.

7. Click Save.
 
 The video is created.
 
 Depending on the size of the presentation and the quality you selected, 
the video may take a long time to create. A progress bar appears in the 
status bar to indicate the video’s progress. You can continue doing 
other work in PowerPoint while the video is being created, but your 
computer will probably respond sluggishly until the video is finished.
 
8. When the progress bar completes, the video is finished!
You can view the video in Windows Media Player by navigating to it in 
Windows Explorer and double-clicking the video’s .wmv file.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
P
owerPoint is pretty good at slinging bullets, so I fig-
ured it would be fitting to end this book with a bevy 
of chapters that aren’t much more than glorified bulleted 
lists. Each chapter in this part covers ten things (more or 
less) worth knowing about PowerPoint. Without further 
ado, here they are, direct from the home office in Fresno, 
California.

Chapter 21
Ten PowerPoint Commandments
And the hapless Windows user said, “But who am I to make this 
presentation? For I am not eloquent, but I am slow of speech and of 
tongue, and my colors clasheth, and my charts runneth over.” And 
Microsoft answered, “Fear not, for unto you this day is given a program, 
which shall be called PowerPoint, and it shall make for you slides, which 
shall bring forth titles and bullets and, yea, even diagrams.”
— Presentations 1:1
A
nd so it came to pass that these ten PowerPoint commandments were 
passed down from generation to generation. Obey these commandments 
and it shall go well with you, with your flip chart, and with your overhead 
projector.
I. Thou Shalt Frequently 
Savest Thy Work
Every two or three minutes, press Ctrl+S. It takes only a second to save your 
file, and you never know when you’ll be the victim of a rotating power outage 
(even if you don’t live in California).
II. Thou Shalt Storeth Each Presentation 
in Its Proper Folder
Whenever you save a file, double-check the folder that you’re saving it to. It’s 
all too easy to save a presentation in the wrong folder and then spend hours 
searching for the file later. You’ll wind up blaming the computer for losing 
your files.

290
Part V: The Part of Tens 
III. Thou Shalt Not Abuseth Thy 
Program’s Formatting Features
Yes, PowerPoint lets you set every word in a different font, use 92 different 
colors on a single slide, and fill every last pixel of empty space with clip art. 
If you want your slides to look like ransom notes, go ahead. Otherwise, keep 
things simple.
IV. Thou Shalt Not Stealeth 
Copyrighted Materials
Given a few minutes with Google or any other search engine, you can probably 
find just the right picture or snippet of clip art for any presentation need that 
might arise. But keep in mind that many of those pictures, clip art drawings, 
and media files are copyrighted. Don’t use them if you don’t have permission.
V. Thou Shalt Abideth by Thine Color 
Scheme, Auto-Layout, and Template
Microsoft hired a crew of out-of-work artists to pick the colors for the color 
schemes, arrange things with the slide layouts, and create beautifully crafted 
templates. Humor them. They like it when you use their stuff. Don’t feel 
chained to the prepackaged designs, but don’t stray far from them unless you 
have a good artistic eye.
VI. Thou Shalt Not Abuse Thine 
Audience with an Endless 
Array of Cute Animations
PowerPoint animations are cute and sometimes quite useful. But if you do 
a goofy animation on every slide, pretty soon your audience will just think 
you’re strange.

291
 Chapter 21: Ten PowerPoint Commandments
VII. Keep Thy Computer Gurus Happy
If you have a friend or co-worker who knows more about computers than you 
do, keep that person happy. Throw him or her an occasional Twinkie or a bag 
of Cheetos. Treat computer nerds as if they’re human beings. After all, you 
want them to be your friends.
VIII. Thou Shalt Backeth Up 
Thy Files Day by Day
Yes, every day. One of these days, you’ll come to work only to discover a pile 
of rubble where your desk used to be. A federal agent will pick up what’s left 
of your computer’s keyboard and laugh. But if you back up every day, you 
won’t lose more than a day’s work.
IX. Thou Shalt Fear No Evil, for 
Ctrl+Z Is Always with Thee
March ahead with boldness. Not sure what a button does? Click it! Click it 
twice if it makes you feel powerful! The worst that it can do is mess up your 
presentation. If that happens, you can press Ctrl+Z to set things back the way 
they should be.
 
If you really mess things up, just close the presentation without saving. 
Then open the previously saved version. After all, you did obey the first 
commandment, didn’t you?
X. Thou Shalt Not Panic
You’re the only one who knows you’re nervous. You’ll do just fine. Imagine 
the audience naked if that will help. (Unless, of course, you’re making a 
presentation to a nudist club and they actually are naked, in which case try 
to imagine them with their clothes on.)

Ten Tips for Creating 
Readable Slides
T
his chapter gives you a few random tips and pointers that will help you 
produce readable slides.
Try Reading the Slide from 
the Back of the Room
The number-one rule of creating readable slides is that everyone in the room 
must be able to read them. If you’re not certain, there’s one sure way to find 
out: Try it. Fire up the projector, call up the slide, walk to the back of the 
room, and see whether you can read it. If you can’t, you need to make an 
adjustment.
 
Remember that everyone’s eyesight might not be as good as yours. If you have 
perfect vision, squint a little when you get to the back of the room to see how 
the slide might appear to someone whose vision isn’t perfect.
If a projector isn’t handy, make sure you can read your slides from 10 or 15 
feet away from your computer’s monitor.
Avoid Small Text
If you can’t read a slide from the back of the room, it’s probably because 
the text is too small. The rule to live by is that 24-point type is the smallest 
you should use for text that you want people to read. A 12-point type 
might be perfectly readable in a Word document, but it’s way too small for 
PowerPoint.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
No More Than Five Bullets, Please
Have you ever noticed how David Letterman uses two slides to display his 
Top Ten lists? Dave’s producers know that ten items is way too many for one 
screen. Five is just right. You might be able to slip in six now and again, but if 
you’re up to seven or eight, try breaking the slide into two slides.
Avoid Excessive Verbiage Lending to 
Excessively Lengthy Text That Is Not 
Only Redundant but Also Repetitive 
and Reiterative
See what I mean? Maybe the heading should have been, “Be Brief.”
Use Consistent Wording
One sign of an amateur presentation is wording in bullet lists that isn’t 
grammatically consistent. Consider this list:
 
✓ Profits will be improved
 
✓ Expanding markets
 
✓ It will reduce the amount of overseas competition
 
✓ Production increase
Each list item uses a different grammatical construction. The same points 
made with consistent wording have a more natural flow and make a more 
compelling case:
 
✓ Improved profits
 
✓ Expanded markets
 
✓ Reduced overseas competition
 
✓ Increased production

 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Creating Readable Slides
Avoid Unsightly Color Combinations
The professionally chosen color schemes that come with PowerPoint are 
designed to create slides that are easy to read. If you venture away from 
them, be careful about choosing colors that are hard to read.
Watch the Line Endings
Sometimes, PowerPoint breaks a line at an awkward spot, which can make 
slides hard to read. For example, a bullet point might be one word too long 
to fit on a single line. When that happens, you might want to break the line 
elsewhere so the second line has more than one word. (Press Shift+Enter to 
create a line break that doesn’t start a new paragraph.)
Alternatively, you might want to drag the right margin of the text placeholder 
to increase the margin width so that the line doesn’t have to be broken at all.
 
Web addresses (URLs) are notoriously hard to squeeze onto a single line. If 
your presentation includes long URLs, pay special attention to how they fit.
Keep the Background Simple
Don’t splash a bunch of distracting clip art on the background unless it’s 
essential. The purpose of the background is to provide a well-defined visual 
space for the slide’s content. All too often, presenters put up slides that have 
text displayed on top of pictures of the mountains or city skylines, which 
makes the text almost impossible to read.
Use Only Two Levels of Bullets
Sure, it’s tempting to develop your subpoints into sub-subpoints and 
sub-sub-subpoints, but no one will be able to follow your logic. Don’t make 
your slides more confusing than they need to be. If you need to make 
sub-sub-subpoints, you probably need a few more slides.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Keep Charts and Diagrams Simple
PowerPoint can create elaborate graphs that even the best statisticians will 
marvel at. However, the most effective graphs are simple pie charts with 
three or four slices and simple column charts with three or four columns. 
Likewise, pyramid, Venn, and other types of diagrams lose their impact when 
you add more than four or five elements.
 
If you remember only one rule when creating your presentations, remember 
this one: Keep it simple, clean, and concise.

Chapter 23
Ten Ways to Keep Your 
Audience Awake
N
othing frightens a public speaker more than the prospect of the 
audience falling asleep during the speech. Here are some things you 
can do to prevent that from happening. (Yawn.)
Don’t Forget Your Purpose
Too many presenters ramble on and on with no clear sense of purpose. The 
temptation is to throw in every clever quotation and every interesting tidbit 
you can muster that is even remotely related to the topic of your presentation. 
The reason that this temptation is so strong is that you most likely haven’t 
identified what you hope to accomplish with your presentation. In other 
words, you haven’t pinned down your purpose.
Don’t confuse a presentation’s title with its purpose. Suppose that you’re 
asked to give a presentation to a prospective client on the advantages of your 
company’s new, improved, deluxe model ChronSimplastic Infindibulator. 
Your purpose in this presentation is not to convey information about the 
new Infindibulator, but to persuade your client to buy one of the $65 million 
beasties. The title of your presentation might be Infindibulators for the 21st 
Century, but the purpose is “Convince these saps to buy one, or maybe two.”
Don’t Become a Slave to Your Slides
PowerPoint makes such beautiful slides that the temptation is to let them be 
the show. That’s a big mistake. You are the show — not the slides. The slides 
are merely visual aids, designed to make your presentation more effective, 
not to steal the show.

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Your slides should supplement your talk, not repeat it. If you find yourself 
just reading your slides, you need to rethink what you put on the slides. The 
slides should summarize key points, not become the script for your speech.
Don’t Overwhelm Your Audience 
with Unnecessary Detail
On November 19, 1863, a crowd of 15,000 gathered in Gettysburg to hear 
Edward Everett, one of the greatest orators of the time. Mr. Everett spoke 
for two hours about the events that had transpired during the famous battle. 
When he finished, Abraham Lincoln rose to deliver a brief two-minute 
postscript that has become the most famous speech in American history.
If PowerPoint had been around in 1863, Everett probably would have spoken 
for four hours. PowerPoint practically begs you to talk too much. When you 
start typing bullets, you can’t stop. Pretty soon, you have 40 slides for a 
20-minute presentation. That’s about 35 more than you probably need. Try to 
shoot for one slide for every two to five minutes of your presentation.
Don’t Neglect Your Opening
As they say, you get only one opportunity to make a first impression. Don’t 
waste it by telling a joke that has nothing to do with the topic, apologizing 
for your lack of preparation or nervousness, or listing your credentials. Don’t 
pussyfoot around; get right to the point.
The best openings are those that capture the audience’s attention with a 
provocative statement, a rhetorical question, or a compelling story. A joke is 
okay, but only if it sets the stage for the subject of your presentation.
Be Relevant
The objective of any presentation is to lead your audience to say, “Me, too!” 
Unfortunately, many presentations leave the audience thinking, “So what?”
The key to being relevant is giving your audience members what they need, 
and not what you think is interesting or important. The most persuasive 
presentations are those that present solutions to real problems rather than 
opinions about hypothetical problems.

299
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Keep Your Audience Awake
Don’t Forget the Altar Call
What would a Billy Graham crusade be without the altar call? A wasted 
opportunity.
The best presentations are the ones that entice your audience to action. 
That might mean buying your product, changing their lifestyles, or just being 
interested enough to do more research into your topic.
But the opportunity will be wasted if you don’t invite your audience to 
respond in some way. If you’re selling something (and we’re all selling 
something!), make it clear how your audience can buy. Tell them the toll-free 
number. Give them a handout with links of Web sites they can go to for more 
information. Ask everyone to sing Just As I Am. Do whatever it takes.
Practice, Practice, Practice
Back to good ol’ Abe: Somehow a rumor got started that Abraham Lincoln 
hastily wrote the Gettysburg Address on the train, just before pulling into 
Gettysburg. In truth, Lincoln agonized for weeks over every word.
Practice, practice, practice. Work through the rough spots. Polish the 
opening and the closing and all the awkward transitions in between. Practice 
in front of a mirror. Videotape yourself. Time yourself.
Relax!
Don’t worry! Be happy! Even the most gifted public speakers are scared 
silly every time they step up to the podium. Whether you’re speaking to one 
person or 10,000, relax. In 20 minutes, it will all be over.
No matter how nervous you are, no one knows it except you. That is, unless 
you tell them. The number one rule of panic avoidance is to never apologize 
for your fears. Behind the podium, your knees might be knocking hard 
enough to bruise yourself, but no one else will notice. After you swab down 
your armpits and wipe the drool off your chin, people will say, “Weren’t you 
nervous? You seemed so relaxed!”

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Expect the Unexpected
Plan on things going wrong, because they will. The projector may not focus, 
the microphone may go dead, you may drop your notes on the way to the 
podium. Who knows what else may happen?
Take things in stride, but be prepared for problems you can anticipate. Carry 
an extra set of notes in your pocket. Bring your own microphone if you have 
one. Have a backup projector ready if possible.
Don’t Be Boring
An audience can overlook almost anything, but one thing they’ll never forgive 
you for is boring them. Above all, do not bore your audience.
This guideline doesn’t mean you have to tell jokes, jump up and down, or talk 
fast. Jokes, excessive jumping, and rapid speech can be unimaginably boring. 
If you obey the other instructions in this chapter — if you have a clear-cut 
purpose and stick to it, avoid unnecessary detail, and address real needs — 
you’ll never be boring. Just be yourself and have fun. If you have fun, so will 
your audience.

Chapter 24
Ten Things That Often Go Wrong
T
he actual number of things that can go wrong when working with 
PowerPoint is probably closer to 10,000, but the following are among the 
things that go wrong most often.
I Can’t Find My File
You spent hours polishing that presentation, and now you can’t find the file. 
You know that you saved it, but it’s not there! The problem is probably one 
of two things: Either you saved the file in a different folder, or you used a 
different filename to save it than you intended. The solution? The most likely 
way to find your presentation is to check the list on the right side of the File 
menu. This list includes the presentations you’ve most recently worked on. 
If you don’t find the presentation in that list, summon the Open dialog box 
(choose File➪Open) and then click Recent Places. This displays a larger list 
of recently used files. As a last resort, use the Windows search feature (on 
the Start menu) to find the presentation.
I’ve Run Out of Hard Drive Space
Nothing is more frustrating than creating a fancy PowerPoint presentation 
and then discovering that you’re completely out of hard drive space. What 
to do? Open the Windows Explorer window (choose Start➪Computer) and 
rummage through your hard drive, looking for files you don’t need. Delete 
enough files to free up a few megabytes and then press Alt+Tab to move back 
to PowerPoint and save your file. I did this recently: I had to delete a bunch 
of music files that I had accumulated to make my own CDs. (It was either 
them or the Word document files for the first few chapters of this book. Not 
an easy decision.)

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If your hard drive is full and you can’t find more than a few files to delete, 
try double-clicking the Recycle Bin icon and choosing File➪Empty Recycle 
Bin. This often frees up additional hard drive space. If that doesn’t work, 
choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Cleanup. The 
Disk Cleanup program scans your hard drive for unnecessary files and offers 
to remove them for you. It can often free up many megabytes of hard drive 
space.
If you often run out of hard drive space, consider adding a larger hard drive 
to your computer. Nowadays, you can buy a 250GB hard drive for less than 
$100. If the thought of opening up your computer and installing a hard drive 
causes you to break out in a sweat, you can also get external drives that plug 
in to your computer’s USB port.
I’ve Run Out of Memory
Many people still use computers with only 512MB of internal memory. 
Although you can run PowerPoint with as little as 512MB of memory, 1GB is 
a more reasonable minimum, and 4GB is ideal. The additional memory helps 
your computer to not give up and crash from the overload of open applications. 
Memory is cheap! Why not make sure you have enough?
PowerPoint Has Vanished!
You’re working at your computer, minding your own business, when 
suddenly — whoosh! — PowerPoint disappears. What happened? Most 
likely, you clicked some area outside the PowerPoint window or you pressed 
Alt+Tab or Alt+Esc, which whisks you away to another program. To get 
PowerPoint back, press Alt+Tab. You might have to press Alt+Tab several 
times before PowerPoint comes back to life.
 
PowerPoint can also vanish into thin air if you use a screen-saver program. 
Try giving the mouse a nudge to see whether PowerPoint reappears.
I Accidentally Deleted a File
Just found out how to delete files and couldn’t stop yourself, eh? Relax. It 
happens to everyone. Odds are good that you can rescue the deleted file if 
you act quickly enough. Double-click the Recycle Bin icon that sits on your 
desktop. You can probably find the deleted file there. If so, right-click it and 
choose Restore from the menu that appears.

303
 Chapter 24: Ten Things That Often Go Wrong
It Won’t Let Me Edit That
No matter how hard you click, PowerPoint won’t let you edit that doohickey 
onscreen. What gives? The doohickey is probably a part of the Slide Master. 
To edit it, click the View tab and then click the Slide Master button in the 
Presentation Views group. This step displays the Slide Master and enables 
you to edit it. However, the object you’re trying to edit might be underneath 
another object. If so, move the other object aside temporarily. When you’re 
done, drag the other object back into place.
Something Seems to Be Missing
You just read the chapter about SmartArt, but nothing happens when you try 
to insert a SmartArt diagram. Or worse, PowerPoint locks up when you try to 
insert SmartArt. Arghhhh!
It’s possible that your PowerPoint installation has somehow become corrupted. 
Perhaps an important system file was accidentally deleted, or a problem has 
somehow managed to creep into the Windows Registry (the file that keeps 
track of settings for Windows as well as for programs you have installed on 
your computer).
Fear not! Office 2010 includes a self-healing feature that can diagnose and 
correct problems with your Office installation. To use it, click the Office 
button, choose PowerPoint Options, and then select the Resources tab and 
click the Diagnose button. Then follow the instructions that appear onscreen.
I Can’t Figure Out Where the 
X-Y-Z Command Went
If you’re a long-time PowerPoint user, you’ve invested a lot of time finding 
where all of its important commands are hidden. Although the new user 
interface of PowerPoint 2010 is supposed to be easier to use, sometimes 
features are still hard to find. For example, PowerPoint’s self-healing feature 
used to be available as the Help➪Detect and Repair command. Now you have 
to navigate several layers deep to find this command.
Fortunately, PowerPoint’s Help has a handy chart that lists the new location 
for all the old commands and toolbar buttons. To find this list, click the Help 
button (found at the top right of the PowerPoint window), click What’s New, 
and then click the link labeled Locations of PowerPoint 2003 Commands in 
PowerPoint 2010.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Projector Doesn’t Work
An LCD projector might not be working for many reasons. Assuming that the 
computer and projector are both plugged in and turned on and you have 
used the correct video cable to connect your computer to the projector, here 
are two common problems you should check:
 
✓ Make sure your video input ports are working. Most projectors have 
two or more video input ports. The projector must be configured to use 
the input port to which your computer is connected. Look for a button 
on the projector to set the input source. The projector might use a 
menu to set the input source: In that case, use the button that calls up 
the menu, scroll through the choices to find the video input source, and 
then select the input port to which your computer is connected.
 
✓ If you’re using a laptop, make sure that the external video port is 
activated. Most laptops have a function key on the keyboard to do this. 
Also look for a key with an icon that represents a video monitor. You 
might have to hold down a function key (probably labeled “Fn”) while 
you press the monitor key. (If you’re using Windows 7, you can switch to 
Presentation mode by pressing Windows+P.)
