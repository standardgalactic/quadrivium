Acknowledgments
A book such as this requires a solid team to bring it to its full 
potential. At every phase of this project, I received extremely 
helpful feedback, guidance, and support from several terrific 
people. And ironically, it is their performance appraisals of my 
performance that have played a key role in strengthening this 
book.
In this regard, I would like to thank Charles P. Leo, Professor 
of Management at the Graziadio School of Business and 
Management at Pepperdine University. Dr. Leo conducted a 
patient and thorough technical review of the manuscript, and 
he provided numerous insightful comments and suggestions.
I also offer thanks to Donovan R. Greene, PhD, one of the fore-
most organizational psychologists and executive coaches. Dr. 
Greene has been a longtime source of expertise in a wide range 
of managerial areas. He not only conducts outstanding semi-
nars on performance appraisal, but also serves as a great role 
model when actually conducting appraisals. I thank him for all 
the early lessons in this important area.
I also thank the entire team at Wiley Publishing. Mike Baker, 
Acquisitions Editor, provided outstanding direction for this 
project from day one. Another key player on the team has 
been the project’s editor, Elizabeth Kuball. She is truly an edi-
tor’s editor, with outstanding ability not only in terms of writ-
ing, but also in terms of project management.
I would like to give a posthumous thanks to the father of “back-
timing,” L. K. Lloyd, who also happened to be my father. A 
master in many fields, L. K.’s abilities to manage by wandering 
around and conduct performance appraisals that helped his 
employees learn, grow, and advance are truly legendary.
I also offer a very special thanks to my home team. First, I am 
very fortunate to have a fantastic research librarian, friend, 
and wife, Roberta. And I feel equally fortunate to have three 
wonderful children, Jessica, Stacey, and Joshua. If there were 
performance appraisals for a wife and children, they would all 
be rated as “exceptional” in every category.

Performance Appraisals & Phrases For Dummies 
xvi

Introduction
A
s the time to conduct performance appraisals approaches, 
many managers experience one or more of the following 
feelings: anxiety, nervousness, nausea, aggravation, frustration, 
confusion, fear, stress, or dread. Frankly, based on the 
way that many companies put together their performance 
appraisal programs, these reactions aren’t surprising.
The good news is that today’s performance appraisals are 
user-friendly, easily administered, and an essential compo-
nent of effective management. Performance appraisal plays 
a central role in developing your employees and enhancing 
their performance and productivity. As such, the appraisal 
process plays a key role in adding value to your employees — 
and ultimately to your department and your company at large.
And as for those negative feelings aroused by performance 
appraisal, the antidote is in your hands!
About This Book
I wrote this book to identify every key piece of the perfor-
mance appraisal process, and to provide up-to-date informa-
tion and tools to help you effectively manage them. Every 
chapter stands on its own, and you can jump around this 
book as much as you like, without missing a beat.
If you’re interested in (or concerned by) a particular aspect 
of performance appraisals, you can flip right to it and hit the 
page running. For example, if you’re interested in how to con-
duct an appraisal session, there is a chapter just for you. And 
the same applies if you’re interested in knowing more about 
the kinds of performance appraisals, how to gather the right 
performance data, how to avoid mistakes, how to follow up 
with employees, and how to do just about anything else when 
it comes to performance appraisals.

If you’re interested in seeing the best phrases to use in the 
process, there are nine whole chapters of phrases — more 
than 3,200 phrases in all — waiting for you!
Conventions Used in This Book
I don’t use many conventions in this book, but I do use a 
couple that you should be aware of:
 
✓ Anytime I refer to a Web address, I put the address in 
monofont, to make it easier for you to spot.
 
✓ I alternate the use of masculine and feminine pronouns 
for gender equality.
What You’re Not to Read
Although I encourage you to read the whole book, you can 
still build your performance appraisal skills if you pass on 
anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon. (For more on 
icons, see the “Icons Used in This Book” section, later in this 
Introduction.)
This book has thousands of phrases that you can use when 
evaluating your employees, but you certainly don’t need to 
read every single phrase. Think of these phrase chapters the 
way you would any other reference book — search for what 
you need when you need it and leave the rest for later.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made a number of assumptions

productive ways to carry out your responsibilities in this 
area.
 
✓ You want to build your performance appraisal skills. 
Whether you’re new to management or you’re an expe-
rienced veteran, I assume that you aren’t satisfied with 
your current appraisal skills and you’re looking for a way 
to improve them.
If at least one of these assumptions sounds like you, then this 
book has some sound advice for you.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve divided this book into four parts. Although the order 
of the parts basically follows the same sequencing that you 
would follow in the actual performance appraisal process, you 
can easily target any section and find all you need to know 
without having to read anything that precedes or follows it.
Part I: When It’s Time to 
Appraise Your Employees
This part provides you with the full range of foundational 
information on the performance appraisal process. I cover the 
widespread and major roles that performance appraisal plays, 
as well as the vast array of performance appraisal systems, 
techniques, and forms, and the effectiveness of each.
Part II: Working Your Way 
through the Process
In this part, you find the best ways to carry out each of the 
performance appraisal steps. I give you hands-on information 
on topics that cover the full range of planning and prepara-
tion, gathering and analyzing employee performance data, 
completing the evaluation forms, and avoiding the most 
common mistakes.

In this part . . .
P
erformance appraisals play a remarkably wide range 
of roles. Instead of being an isolated annual event, 
appraisals are but one component in the overall process 
of performance management. Within this framework, a 
state-of-the-art performance appraisal system generates a 
vast array of positive and productive outcomes.
The chapters in this part show you how appraisals moti-
vate your employees, build their self-insights, and set the 
groundwork for training and developmental programs, all 
the while enhancing individual and departmental 
performance.
You also fi nd a snapshot of the wide range of appraisal 
systems, techniques, processes, and forms, along with 
insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Looked at in 
a slightly different way, these chapters conduct a perfor-
mance appraisal of the various performance appraisal 
systems.

Performance Appraisals
In This Chapter
▶ Facilitating the performance appraisal process from start to finish
▶ Generating great results with state-of-the-art performance appraisals
▶ Using performance appraisals to build your employees and their 
productivity
M
any managers see the performance appraisal process 
as an administrative rite that consumes a lot of time, 
while producing little more than frustration, confrontation, 
and piles of paperwork. This reaction is totally understand-
able if your company is relying on a performance appraisal 
system that has fallen woefully out of date.
However, as I explain in this book, the performance appraisal 
process can play a remarkably powerful role in building your 
employees, as well as their performance and productivity — 
when it’s done right.
Part of the problem with the appraisal process is that managers 
often see it as an isolated annual set of steps that are separate 
from all other managerial responsibilities. In actuality, today’s 
performance appraisals are integrated into your ongoing 
managerial functions, year-round.
As a manager, a key part of your role is to maintain strong 
contact with your employees and provide them with on going 
coaching, guidance, and feedback. These steps are called 
performance management. As part of the performance manage-
ment process, there is a specific time — typically once a 

year — when managers gather all the performance data on 
their employees, analyze it, document it, and then provide 
employees with specific feedback. This piece of the perfor-
mance management process is performance appraisal.
Laying the Foundation
In order to take full advantage of the wide range of measur-
able benefits associated with state-of-the-art performance 
appraisals, you need to start with a few foundational steps.
Recognizing the roles of 
performance appraisal
Managers who view performance appraisal as an isolated 
annual event tend to regard documentation as its sole and 
primary purpose. Although documentation has a place in the 
process, it sits beside numerous equally important functions:
 
✓ Motivating employees
 
✓ Educating employees
 
✓ Clarifying performance expectations
 
✓ Increasing self-awareness
 
✓ Building your managerial skills
 
✓ Communicating and reinforcing company values
 
✓ Establishing performance goals and developmental goals
 
✓ Establishing training and reviewing its effectiveness
 
✓ Setting the bases for promotions, transfers, and raises
 
✓ Preventing legal problems
I discuss all these functions in greater detail in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 1: Building Success with Performance Appraisals 11
Laying the Foundation
Seeking additional sources 
of feedback
Most people think that the only source of feedback during 
the appraisal process is the manager herself. Although the 
manager’s role in the process is central and essential, the 
quality and effectiveness of the entire process is significantly 
upgraded when two additional sources are included.
These two primary additional sources — self-evaluations and 
360-degree feedback — provide insights that lead to the con-
tinuation of excellent performance and improvement of sub-
par performance.
Turn to Chapter 3 for more on these types of feedback.
Strengthening your role
 
As your employees’ manager, you play the central role in the 
performance appraisal process, because you’re still the pri-
mary source of feedback.
In order to effectively carry out this responsibility, one of the 
most important foundational steps is to have a clear under-
standing of the different types of performance appraisal sys-
tems that are available, along with the pros and cons of each. 
This information helps you understand, enhance, and succeed 
with any system that you may be using.
Here are your options for performance appraisals (all of 
which I cover in greater detail in Chapter 3):
 
✓ Essays
 
✓ Graphic rating scales
 
✓ Checklists
 
✓ Forced choice methods
 
✓ Employee ranking
 
✓ Critical incidents
 
✓ Behavioral checklists
 
✓ Management by objectives

Successfully Navigating through the Appraisal Process
Successfully Navigating through 
the Appraisal Process
With the foundation in place, you can take some specific pre-
paratory steps that help set the stage for highly effective and 
productive performance appraisals.
Generating the right mindset 
and the right plans
As I explain in Chapter 4, an essential step in the appraisal 
process is to establish a performance appraisal mindset in 
which you:
 
✓ Truly see yourself as the leader.
 
✓ Set positive expectations regarding the entire process.
 
✓ Take productive steps to identify and overcome any fear 
or reluctance you may be experiencing regarding the 
appraisal process.
 
By applying specific strategies to build your self-awareness 
and empathy, you’ll greatly enhance your understanding 
of your employees as well as your skills to appraise them. 
When you combine these steps with some advance planning, 
anticipation of the kinds of questions you may encounter, and 
preparation of the kinds of answers that you can provide, 
you reduce your personal reluctance and increase your 
confidence.
Accumulating and examining 
performance data
In order for your feedback to have relevance and a lasting 
impact, you must base it on specific examples of employee 
performance. You can’t glean this information from quick 
visits with your employees, nor is it accessible at the last 
minute.

 Chapter 1: Building Success with Performance Appraisals 13
Successfully Navigating through the Appraisal Process
As I explain in Chapter 5, accurate appraisals require a real 
understanding of your employees’ performance throughout 
the evaluation period. The only way to effectively reach that 
high level of understanding is by sharpening your observa-
tional skills, continuously managing by wandering around, 
and using all your senses in the process.
In addition to carefully monitoring your employees’ perfor-
mance, you can enhance the quality, reliability, accuracy, and 
acceptance of your performance appraisals by familiarizing 
yourself upfront with other important pieces of data as well 
(such as job descriptions, last year’s appraisal, performance 
objectives, notes you’ve been taking, employee files, and pre-
vious performance evaluations).
 
Marginal data gathering leads to useless feedback, which 
leads to employee resistance.
Preparing evaluations
After you’ve reviewed all the performance data from a variety 
of sources, the next step is to complete the evaluation form. 
These forms vary from one company to another, but some 
overarching principles will help you handle this step more 
easily and effectively. Some of these steps include evaluating 
your best employees first, entering your written comments 
before the numerical ratings, and considering how your 
employees will feel when they read your comments.
 
Your comments will generate resistance if they’re invalid, 
unsubstantiated, or focused on personality instead of 
performance.
Conducting highly effective 
appraisal sessions
After you’ve completed evaluation forms with ratings that 
are based on direct observations of your employees’ perfor-
mance, behaviors, and results, you’re ready for the face-to-
face performance appraisal sessions.
Because you’re providing your employees with feedback, 
coaching, and guidance throughout the evaluation period, 

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
14
Successfully Navigating through the Appraisal Process
your employees already have a clear understanding of how 
they’ve been performing on the job, so you’ve all but elimi-
nated the likelihood of resistance or defensiveness during this 
meeting.
Some of the key steps that will help make these meetings even 
more successful include
 
✓ Understanding your objectives for the meeting itself
 
✓ Setting an agenda
 
✓ Practicing any comments that may be difficult to express
 
✓ Bringing your notes and relevant forms and files with you
 
✓ Entering with positive expectations
 
✓ Preventing interruptions
 
✓ Scheduling sufficient time for the appraisal
 
✓ Selecting a private venue for the appraisal
As you hold appraisal sessions, you also need to take 
some key steps when opening the discussions, giving your 
employees opportunities to talk, engaging in active listening, 
reviewing objectives and results, analyzing critical incidents, 
discussing strengths and areas needing improvement, going 
over the final rating, and properly concluding the sessions — 
all of which (and more) I cover in Chapter 6.
Avoiding mistakes
As you navigate through the performance appraisal pro-
cess, be sure to note and avoid the common errors that can 
instantly undo all your efforts in this area. As I outline in 
Chapter 7, some of the strategies to identify and deal with 
these errors include
 
✓ Accurately assessing recent events
 
✓ Removing bias and stereotypes
 
✓ Ending the halo-and-horns effects
 
✓ Thinking twice about first impressions

 Chapter 1: Building Success with Performance Appraisals 15
Successfully Navigating through the Appraisal Process
 
✓ Understanding the contrast effect
 
✓ Controlling your emotions
 
✓ Avoiding the central tendency and skews
 
✓ Eliminating labeling, arguing, defensiveness, excessive 
talking, postponed sessions, and surprises
Taking follow-up actions
Although some managers believe that the appraisal process 
ends when the performance appraisal session ends, that 
ending is actually more of a beginning.
With the evaluations completed, you’ll have plenty of data to 
use in developing real goals with your employees (namely, 
goals that are clear, specific, prioritized, challenging, mea-
surable, and supported by action plans). In order to be truly 
effective, these goals should be in sync with company goals 
as well as your goals, and they should be designed to enhance 
your employees’ performance, productivity, and development.
With these goals in place, your next step is to manage by wan-
dering around and providing your employees with ongoing 
communication, coaching, guidance, and feedback. By doing 
so, you’ll be able to keep your employees on track to meet 
their goals. You’ll also be able to identify and correct any 
number of departmental issues before they become serious 
problems.
With the appraisal process functioning as but one component 
in the performance management process, a cycle is actually 
developed: First, you and your employees jointly establish 
and agree upon specific performance and developmental 
goals. Then you provide ongoing coaching and feedback 
throughout the evaluation period. When the time for perfor-
mance appraisals arrives, both you and your employees know 
exactly how they’ve performed, so you have no difficulty cre-
ating the evaluation or conducting the face-to-face sessions. 
And after you’ve completed those sessions, the goal-setting 
process starts anew. Chapter 8 contains a detailed discussion 
of this cycle and the follow-up actions you need to take.

Using Effective Phrases and Expressions
Using Effective Phrases 
and Expressions
Your written comments in the performance appraisal process 
offer an excellent opportunity to present compelling, long-
lasting, and motivational feedback to your employees. In 
order to do so, the phrases you use must be specifically 
designed to energize your employees to continue and even 
surpass their excellent performance, while simultaneously 
helping them to understand and upgrade their questionable 
performance.
The best way to reach this objective is to identify the key 
areas of performance and then provide powerful phrases that 
target the full range of employee behaviors. With this in mind, 
Chapters 9 through 17 provide more than 3,200 such phrases. 
With a state-of-the-art performance appraisal system in place, 
backed up by the best phrases to use in this process, you’re 
in an excellent position to enhance the performance and 
productivity of your employees, your department, and your 
company.

icture yourself as an archer, your bowstring fully 
extended and ready to sail an arrow toward the target 50 
yards down the range. You carefully aim and let the arrow fly. 
But this is a different kind of range — you can’t see where your 
arrow actually lands. You have no way of knowing if you hit the 
target or the bail of hay behind it. As a result, you don’t know 
what to improve, how to improve, if you’re actually improving, 
or whether you need to improve at all. What you do know is 
that archery is no longer interesting, motivating, or fun.
Welcome to life without performance appraisals.
 
Everyone needs feedback. Without it, you have no way to 
learn, grow, and fully reach your potential.
The problem is, many managers see appraisals as annual ritu-
als that drag them and their employees away from their work, 
seemingly satisfying no one but the human resources depart-
ment. And this feeling is natural — after all, most businesses 
haven’t taken the time to explain the purpose of appraisals or 
train their managers in how to conduct them.

 
Performance appraisals shouldn’t be isolated events that 
stand starkly removed from the rest of your managerial 
responsibilities. As a manager, you’re communicating with 
your employees on a regular and frequent basis. You’re pro-
viding them with assignments, updates, information, and 
feedback on their work. You may even be writing up their per-
formance on various projects during the course of a year.
By taking these steps, you’re engaging in what’s called per-
formance management. And within the framework of perfor-
mance management, there is one point each year when you 
provide your employees with formal and documented feed-
back regarding their performance. That piece of the process 
is called the performance appraisal.
If I told you I knew about an easy-to-use managerial strategy 
that improves employee motivation, focus, insights, and 
growth, you’d probably be intrigued — especially if that strat-
egy were free. Good news: Performance appraisals have all 
these intriguing advantages, and many more!
In this chapter, I explore the rationale behind performance 
appraisals. I also give you steps you can take to easily, seam-
lessly, and effectively incorporate performance appraisals 
into your managerial style.
Harnessing the Motivational 
Power of Appraisals
Motivation is the process that energizes employees and 
propels them to pursue their goals. Well-designed and well-
executed performance appraisals have a strong motivational 
impact. Appraisals have the power to motivate employees 
because they provide a number of interconnected benefits:
 
✓ They demonstrate the need for improvement. If employ-
ees don’t have a clear understanding of how they’ve 
been performing, they can’t be motivated to make any 
improvements. After all, if they haven’t been told that 
there are issues regarding their expertise, their com-
munication, or the quality or quantity of their work, and 
if they don’t sense that any improvements are needed,

18

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
19
Harnessing the Motivational Power of Appraisals
then they certainly won’t be motivated to work harder in 
these areas.
 
✓ They meet higher-level psychological needs. Researchers 
continue to find that recognition is one of the most pow-
erful forms of motivation for large numbers of employ-
ees. Although you can find numerous possible sources 
of recognition on the job, performance appraisals are an 
opportunity for employees to receive formal, significant, 
and enduring recognition from their manager. This pros-
pect is particularly energizing for that large percentage of 
employees who have strong needs in this area.
 
✓ They build a sense of personal value. When manag-
ers take the time and effort to carefully review, analyze, 
document, and discuss performance with employees, 
the underlying message to the employees is that they’re 
important and valuable, and this alone is quite reward-
ing, whether the feedback is positive or not.
 
✓ They enhance personal development. Performance eval-
uations are motivational for employees who are looking 
to enhance their personal learning, growth, and develop-
ment. Appraisals are a highly valuable source of infor-
mation, insights, and tools necessary for such progress. 
Performance appraisals are similarly motivational for 
employees whose needs are centered on achievement, 
goal attainment, and sensing personal effectiveness, 
respect, and trust.
 
✓ They turn employees around. When employees are 
performing poorly, performance appraisals can provide 
the wakeup call that they need to get refocused and 
reenergized. Perhaps a struggling employee has been 
given a verbal warning, and maybe she was written up 
along the way. This type of negative documentation is 
often perceived as self-serving for the company, and it 
can easily generate resentment, anger, and defensive-
ness, none of which is much of a precursor to improved 
performance. With performance appraisal, however, the 
purpose of the session is not strictly disciplinary, so the 
employee is more likely to walk in with a more receptive 
and open mind. As a result, your comments regarding an 
employee’s questionable performance have an excellent 
chance of being heard and generating action as a result.
 
✓ They increase satisfaction. When performance apprais-
als meet the employees’ needs in such areas as gaining 

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
20
Educating while Evaluating
recognition, sensing achievement and competence, 
experiencing growth, and meeting objectives, they’re 
also contributing to the employees’ job satisfaction, and 
this is one of the most important elements at work today. 
When employees are satisfied, some of the most visible 
indicators are reduced turnover, absenteeism, and 
tardiness.
On the flipside, when employees are subjected to a shoddy or 
even nonexistent performance appraisal system, the opportu-
nities to fulfill these higher-level employee needs are substan-
tially reduced.
 
If you think about this in psychological terms, when the 
employees’ needs are not being met on the job, employees are 
likely to try to meet them elsewhere. The result can be joining 
another company or simply spending less time on the job and 
more time on activities that do meet their needs — and those 
are the very pursuits that can cause them to miss work or be 
less than productive when they’re at work.
Just as a solid performance appraisal system is motivational, 
the lack of such a system undercuts motivation and fosters a 
growing sense of dissatisfaction, frustration, and confusion. 
Employees who aren’t given regular performance appraisals 
become hapless archers who don’t know where their arrows 
have landed.
Educating while Evaluating
Performance appraisals are also important because of the 
numerous ways in which they contribute to employee educa-
tion and development.
In order for anyone to learn, he needs to receive feedback 
on his performance. Performance appraisal is an outstand-
ing educational tool because the entire process is based on 
providing feedback. Employees learn a great deal about them-
selves through performance appraisal, whether the apprais-
als take the form of self-evaluations or evaluations from their 
managers, peers, and others in the workplace. (For more 
information on the types of appraisals, turn to Chapter 3.)

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
21
Educating while Evaluating
In this section, I fill you in on the many ways in which per-
formance appraisals can help your employees — and you! — 
learn and grow.
Setting expectations
When an employee starts a new job, she’s typically provided 
with a job description that spells out her responsibilities 
and functions, which, ideally, helps her understand what 
she’s supposed to do. But in order to perform at peak levels, 
employees also need to know how they’re supposed to work. 
This type of information is not usually found in a job descrip-
tion, but it’s critical when the time comes for the employee to 
be evaluated.
A performance evaluation plays a powerful educational role 
by providing employees with an essential counterbalance to 
Feedback: Would you like a 
little formality with that?
There are actually two types of 
feedback:
 ✓ Informal feedback: Informal 
feedback is brief and intermit-
tent advice, typically provided 
spontaneously or in a casual 
discussion. When you provide 
your employees with informal 
feedback, it’s often regarded 
as passing news that may or 
may not require much attention 
or action. Your employees may 
hear what you’re saying, but you 
have no guarantee that they’re 
actually listening or learning.
 ✓ Formal feedback: Formal feed-
back is a planned and structured 
discussion in which the objec-
tive is to give the employees 
clear and specific information 
regarding their performance. 
This automatically means that 
your employees’ attention levels 
are more likely to be turned up 
and tuned in. Employees enter 
this session with the expecta-
tion that they’re about to receive 
key information regarding their 
performance. This expectation 
sets the stage for them to listen 
more attentively to what you’re 
saying.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
22
Educating while Evaluating
their job description. By understanding the content of the job 
description as well as the content of the performance evalua-
tion, an employee is armed with full knowledge of the meaning of 
excellent performance. This knowledge can actually help draw 
out such performance.
Building self-awareness
Performance evaluations have the unique power to help 
employees throughout the company build their self-awareness, 
whether they’re being evaluated or doing the evaluating. 
The better that employees truly understand themselves, the 
better they’ll be able to learn, grow, and perform on the job. 
If their self-insights are marginal, their work is likely to be 
marginal, too.
Generating insights for your employees
A well-crafted performance appraisal is one of the most pow-
erful tools for increasing your employees’ self-awareness. 
With greater understanding of their strengths and weaknesses 
on the job, it’s far easier for them to be more focused, goal-
oriented, and productive.
 
An effective way to teach your employees is to focus on them 
as individuals, instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach to 
education. As an educational process, performance appraisal is 
100 percent focused on your employees as unique individuals.
Although most of life’s experiences offer a degree of learning, 
there is a random aspect to many such experiences. Incorrect, 
inappropriate, or meaningless lessons can be learned at any 
time, often leaving a person on the sidelines, in the wrong 
game, or generally out of it. But this doesn’t happen with per-
formance appraisals. When they’re conducted properly, infor-
mation is direct, factual, and specific, and it’s tailored to just 
one person (namely, the employee you’re evaluating).
 
The feedback that your employees receive during a perfor-
mance appraisal has extra credibility for one main reason: 
You’re providing it. Employees are more likely to believe and 
internalize your comments because you’ve observed and ana-
lyzed their performance, and because you’re one of the most 
important people in their lives. If you’re unsure about this, 
just ask them.

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
23
Educating while Evaluating
Generating awareness for yourself
As a manager in the performance appraisal process, you have 
three key opportunities to build your own self-awareness. 
(You didn’t think your employees were the only ones who had 
something to learn, did you?)
 
✓ The feedback that you receive from your own manager 
can be a major help in strengthening your self-awareness, 
just as your comments do for your employees.
 
✓ If you opt to complete a self-evaluation form, you, too, 
are afforded the opportunities for self-awareness that 
accompany this step in the process.
Points of reflection
When you look at yourself in the 
mirror at home, you’re essentially 
getting a look at yourself from one 
perspective. Granted, it’s an accu-
rate view, but it isn’t the complete 
view. If you have full-length folding 
mirrors that allow you to see yourself 
from many different angles, you’re 
sure to get a more thorough look and 
a good deal more information, for 
better or for worse.
The same principle applies to per-
formance appraisals. The feedback 
you provide to your employees 
essentially holds up one mirror that 
gives them a look at themselves, 
while feedback from others in the 
workplace holds up many mirrors 
from entirely different perspectives. 
With all this additional data, there 
are great opportunities for additional 
self-awareness and growth.
And if your company’s appraisal 
system gives employees the option 
to complete self-evaluations, there 
are even more opportunities to build 
self-awareness. When employees 
take the self-evaluation option seri-
ously, they tend to spend some quiet 
time truly thinking about their perfor-
mance, productivity, skills, knowl-
edge, and other key elements that 
are central to their jobs. The mere act 
of sitting down and looking honestly 
at their work not only helps them 
understand their performance on the 
job, but also helps them understand 
themselves.
At the same time, when employ-
ees take this option casually and 
automatically rate themselves as 
outstanding in every category, the 
opportunities for self-awareness will 
arrive when you sit down with them 
and paint a more accurate picture.
And if your company’s appraisal 
process includes feedback from the 
employees’ peers and subordinates, 
the opportunities for self-awareness 
and growth are multiplied.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
24
Educating while Evaluating
 
✓ If your company uses a 360-degree feedback program 
(see the nearby sidebar, “Points of reflection”), your 
peers, employees, and others in the workplace can 
enhance your self-awareness on a wide range of work-
place behaviors, including planning, organizing, commu-
nicating, delegating, and leading.
With a greater understanding of how you’re perceived in 
these areas (and in many others that are part of managerial 
performance), you, too, now have the advantage of looking at 
yourself in many mirrors. You can truly see yourself as others 
see you, and that is one of the premier building blocks for 
self-awareness.
Increasing your managerial 
effectiveness
While you’re carrying the various responsibilities that are 
part of the performance appraisal process, you’re also prof-
iting from one of the less apparent roles that this process 
plays. By definition, in order to conduct effective evaluations, 
you need to have finely tuned observational skills. Without 
such skills, your reviews will be full of misstatements and mis-
takes, and the one-on-one sessions with your employees will 
miss the mark. When you have excellent observational skills, 
you’re empowered with accurate firsthand data, one of the 
true keys to building successful evaluations.
 
Managers quickly learn that one of the best ways to gather 
accurate data about their employees is to engage in a highly 
regarded practice called managing by wandering around. This 
doesn’t mean having constant face time with your employees 
every day, but it does mean that you get out of your office fre-
quently and visit with your employees in their work areas.
When you take these steps, you end up creating a mental grid 
for yourself in which you can file the behaviors and actions 
that you observe. And the more frequently you use this frame-
work with your employees, the more astute an observer you 
become.
 
As you spend time in a department gathering performance 
appraisal data, an important byproduct is that you’re likely 
to gather firsthand information about new developments, 

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
25
Educating while Evaluating
problems, issues, and concerns. In many cases, these matters 
may not have been brought to your attention until they’ve 
morphed into full-blown crises.
Plus, face time with your team has a positive impact on their 
motivation and morale. When a manager spends time with her 
employees, the employees simply feel better. The unspoken 
message is that the employees are important and valuable, 
and that’s a message you want to convey.
 
There is more to observation than meets the eye. If you really 
want an accurate picture of employee performance, think about 
observing with all your senses. The next time you wander 
through the work area, turn up your antennae and concentrate 
on what you’re seeing, hearing, touching, and even smelling. 
In every respect, this is a sensible way to manage. (Turn to 
Chapter 5 for more on managing with all your senses.)
Transmitting company values
Performance appraisals educate the employees on the compa-
ny’s culture. For example, some companies place a premium 
on independence, creative thinking, and assertiveness, 
and language in their appraisals reinforces these types of 
behaviors.
Other employers may speak glowingly of their support for 
such behaviors, but they don’t mention them in their perfor-
mance appraisals. In fact, in such companies, these behaviors 
may be viewed as trouble-making, boat-rocking, or arguing. 
Their reviews may emphasize such qualities as “obedience,” 
“respect,” and “following company procedures.”
Performance appraisals spell out valuable information 
regarding the behaviors that are valued and rewarded in the 
company. If employees want to succeed and thrive in a given 
company, paying attention to which company values are high-
lighted in their performance appraisals is essential.
Understanding and meeting goals
A performance appraisal is an excellent time to confirm that 
the employees understand your goals, as well as the goals for 
your department and the company at large.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
26
Educating while Evaluating
Employees are often provided with this information when 
they join a company, but that can be the first and last time 
that they ever hear anything about it. Performance appraisals 
offer the perfect time to clarify and reinforce the company’s 
objectives and align the employees’ goals with your goals.
The better your employees understand the objectives, espe-
cially reasonably challenging objectives, the more motivated 
they’ll be to meet them.
Defining a career path
When employees receive performance-based feedback 
through the appraisal process, it’s as if they’ve plugged into a 
navigation system that pinpoints their exact location on their 
career path. But employees need to know more than where 
they are — they need to know if they’re on the right road, and 
if that road is taking them where they want to go.
Through the appraisal process, you gain a better understand-
ing of each employee. This insight is generated from the most 
valuable indicator of a person’s strengths and weaknesses — 
namely, her behavior. People can talk about performance, 
standards, and goals, but their performance on the job speaks 
much louder.
With in-depth knowledge of each employee, a manager is in 
the perfect position to work with an employee to help set 
the most appropriate career path and objectives. Employees 
should be receiving some of this feedback on a regular and 
informal basis throughout the year, but performance apprais-
als guarantee that they receive a current road map at least 
once a year.
 
When performance appraisals are overlooked or given short 
shrift, employees will still be on a career path — but their 
navigation system will be turned off.
Identifying training needs and 
evaluating the results
Before you implement any educational program, whether 
conducted on the job or in sessions that are held off-the-job, 

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
27
Educating while Evaluating
the most critical step is to determine the areas in which your 
employees actually need to be trained. The data that you gen-
erate through performance appraisals provide a solid basis 
for determining training and educational needs, whether on 
an individual or departmental basis.
For example, maybe you find a significant number of evalu-
ations that point to problems in teamwork and cooperation. 
This finding would highlight a need for training in these areas, 
such as a team-building program. On the other hand, if the 
performance review data indicate that there are no teamwork 
or cooperation problems, even the best team-building pro-
gram in the world will be of only marginal value.
 
In the world of training, excellent programs are described 
as having a high degree of transference, meaning that the 
information learned in these programs can be readily applied 
to the attendees’ jobs. Training that is conducted without 
consideration for the employees’ needs is destined to have 
minimal transference at best, and this means minimal interest, 
attention, and learning. For example, in order to perform more 
effectively on their jobs, apparel designers don’t need training 
on tax laws.
When a training program is completed, one key step is to eval-
uate its effectiveness. And one of the best ways to do this is to 
compare performance evaluations prior to and after the train-
ing. If the evaluations included consistently low ratings and 
negative comments on teamwork and cooperation prior to the 
training, while the ratings and comments became more posi-
tive in later evaluations, then the training most likely worked. 
However, if later evaluations show that the ratings and com-
ments remained poor or even dropped, then the issue needs 
to be revisited.
 
When employees are provided with clear and specific 
examples of performance where they fell short, and they 
understand the consequences associated with continued 
poor performance, their interest in taking corrective steps is 
significantly enhanced. As a result, they enter an educational 
program as motivated learners, which is essential for learning 
to occur.

Aiding Administration
Performance appraisals play a key role in several adminis-
trative areas. As a result of the data generated through the 
appraisal process, you’re better able to make good decisions 
about a wide range of matters that directly impact your 
employees, your department, and the company at large.
These decisions, many of which are life changing for the 
impacted employees and critical for the organization, are 
best based on facts, and one of the best sources of such facts 
is performance appraisals. With accurate hard data in hand, 
employment-related decisions are easier for managers to 
make — and they’re easier for employees to understand and 
accept.
Setting the groundwork 
for promotions
One of the strongest motivators that many employees bring to 
the job is focused on being promoted.
As manager, you can look back on an employee’s performance 
over a given period and have a general impression regarding 
his promotability. However, if you base a promotion decision 
on feelings rather than findings, you actually generate difficul-
ties in three distinct arenas.
 
✓ Problems for the promoted employee: Without accurate 
performance data, you’re likely to promote the wrong 
person. In such a case, the outcome is obvious. Namely, 
she’s likely to fail. This creates an entirely new menu of 
problems that await you, such as extra time monitoring, 
coaching, counseling, disciplining, and perhaps terminat-
ing this individual. Plus, you’ve lost an employee who 
probably was performing satisfactorily in her original 
position and became just a marginal person in the newly 
filled position.
 
✓ Problems for the employee who is not promoted: By 
promoting the wrong person, you’ve most likely also 
upset at least one other person in the department — 
namely, the person who deserved to move up the ladder. 

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
29
Aiding Administration
This person is likely to be upset and believe that promo-
tions in the department are unfair and arbitrary. These 
types of feelings eat away at an employee’s motivation, 
commitment, and performance — which means one of 
your best employees is now dissatisfied.
 
✓ Problems for the rest of the team: Employees get a 
strong sense of which co-workers are actually deserving 
of promotions. When they see a promotion decision that 
ignores a truly outstanding co-worker, they too develop 
doubts about the role of equity and merit in the depart-
ment. Such doubts can chip away at their attitudes and 
job behaviors as well.
 
When the wrong person is promoted, dissatisfaction is pro-
moted throughout the department.
Setting the groundwork 
for job transfers
A transfer can be a great way for an employee to advance his 
career and undergo a significant growth experience. Although 
the new position may be essentially at the same level as the 
employee’s current position, a transfer allows him to have an 
expanded opportunity to learn, acquire new skills, work with 
different people, and possibly open a wider and more suitable 
career path.
If you have a job opening and an interested employee asks to 
be considered, whether through a job-posting system, internal 
advertisement, or simply word of mouth, you’ll need some 
accurate performance data in order to make a good decision. 
Certainly some important information can be gleaned by an 
interview, but the decision needs to be based on more than a 
friendly conversation.
Assuming there is mutual interest, the next step is to speak 
with the applicant’s manager. Just keep in mind that any 
number of factors can contaminate the data that the manager 
provides. For example, that manager may be upset that her 
employee wants to make a change, which could lead to some 
biased comments.
Here’s where performance appraisals again enter the 
scene. When you’re looking at an employee who wants to 

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
30
Aiding Administration
be transferred, one of the best steps is to review all the appraisal 
data on him. And if you have multiple applicants, this approach 
can help you put all of them on a level playing field, matching 
each against the other on comparable work-related skills and 
behaviors.
Establishing meaningful raises
The raises that you provide to your employees can lead to 
positive, neutral, and negative reactions, all heavily influenced 
by the performance appraisal process itself.
Garnering bravos for the raises you give
With solid performance appraisal data, you can look back at 
clear, specific, and consistent measures of performance for 
each employee on your team. Instead of trying to recall how 
an employee did or simply relying on gut feel, a state-of-the-
art performance appraisal system allows you to accurately 
focus on such factors as quality, quantity, communication, 
cooperation, attendance, and much more. As a result, you’re 
able to base your raise decisions on factors that are fair, con-
sistent, and tailored to individual performance.
 
When raises are based on accurate, fair, and measurable 
behaviors and outcomes, all your employees are literally on 
the same page. With a clear link between performance and 
pay increases, the entire process becomes more transparent, 
equitable, and motivational.
 
One of the major sources of pay-related dissatisfaction is not 
the actual amount of an increase. Instead, the dissatisfac-
tion emanates from what is called pay equity. For example, 
a person may be satisfied with a raise until she finds out 
that a co-worker with less skill, training, or productivity has 
received an equal or larger raise. When this happens, that sat-
isfying raise instantly morphs into a source of dissatisfaction, 
frustration, and demotivation. You can prevent this from hap-
pening by making sure that the raises you grant are clearly 
related to your employees’ performance.
Dodging rotten tomatoes after you hand out raises
 
If raises appear arbitrary or unfair, employees view them neg-
atively. When employees believe they’ve met all the criteria 
for a specific raise, but they’re granted a lower raise for 
no apparent reason, their reaction will be a combination 

 Chapter 2: What Performance Appraisals Do for You and Your Team
31
Aiding Administration
of dissatisfaction, disappointment, distress, and resentment. 
And these feelings aren’t likely to energize employees to put 
forth extra effort in the future.
In fact, when an employee believes that he is under-rewarded, 
he has a conscious or unconscious tendency to get even with 
the company. The attitude goes something like this: “If they’re 
going to shortchange me, I’m going to shortchange them.” 
And employees do this by cutting back in such areas as qual-
ity, quantity, commitment, and dedication.
On the other side of the coin, believe it or not, employees 
generally don’t like being over-rewarded. When they receive a 
raise that greatly exceeds their expectations, their reaction is 
not necessarily positive. In these scenarios, many employees 
experience a combination of guilt, nervousness, and anxiety. 
They don’t sense the feelings of competence and accomplish-
ment that accompany a reasonable raise, and they wonder if 
there are strings attached to this unexpected windfall.
Putting your employees to sleep with your raises
Sometimes raises elicit a ho-hum response from employees, 
indicating that the pay increase neither dissatisfies nor ener-
gizes them.
This response is typically what you see when all employees 
receive essentially the same raise, year after year. In this 
scenario, the raises are simply expected, and the employees 
believe that they’re automatically entitled to them. When 
raises have nothing to do with performance, they actually 
become background noise. Employees typically receive them 
with a shrug, and there is no measurable positive impact on 
motivation or performance.
The employer spends money and gets nothing in return. 
And by the way, the only time these raises impact employee 
behavior is when an employer eliminates them. So, although 
such raises have no motivational power, the raises will demo-
tivate employees if they’re reduced or removed.
Preventing legal problems
One of the less obvious but equally important roles of perfor-
mance appraisals comes from the legal protection that they 
can provide.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
32
Aiding Administration
In today’s workplace, you must fairly, fully, and formally 
document employee performance before you take any kind of 
action — positive or negative, promotion or termination. Such 
documentation is extremely helpful in preventing legal claims 
and in dealing with claims if they’re made.
The documentation associated with performance appraisals 
can clearly demonstrate that decisions on such matters as 
work assignments, transfers, promotions, and raises were 
made on the basis of performance and merit.
At the same time, if an employee is struggling on the job and 
is ultimately terminated, the data and feedback in his perfor-
mance review will provide strong documentation showing 
that the employee was well advised regarding performance 
issues, and was equally well informed regarding the conse-
quences of continued questionable performance.
 
If an employee is terminated and she’s surprised, don’t be sur-
prised if she considers legal options.
Evaluations without raises
Some managers wonder if they 
should conduct performance evalu-
ations when an employee isn’t 
going to be given a raise. Maybe the 
employee doesn’t deserve a raise, or 
maybe the company’s financial situ-
ation has led to a freeze on all raises. 
Either way, evaluating performance 
is still very important.
If an employee’s raise is being denied 
because of performance issues, the 
evaluation helps the employee under-
stand not only the specific areas in 
which she has fallen short, but also 
the consequences of her actions or 
inaction. The process also gives an 
employee the key tools that she can 
use to do better in every respect in 
the future.
Employees should also be evalu-
ated if financial developments have 
caused a company to freeze raises. 
Even if there is no raise, all the moti-
vational and administrative benefits 
of the process still apply. Plus, when 
employers opt to eliminate perfor-
mance evaluations during tough 
times, other problems develop down 
the road. For example, when raises 
are reintroduced, there can be con-
fusion over how to reward employ-
ees when no evaluative data exists.

Chapter 3
The Types of Performance 
Appraisals
In This Chapter
▶ Building on self-evaluations
▶ Capitalizing on the input of others
▶ Strengthening your skills with a full range of appraisals
P
erformance appraisals come in three main categories: 
feedback from the employee himself; feedback from the 
employee’s co-workers and customers; and feedback from 
you, the manager. In order to generate the most thorough and 
accurate feedback for your employees, the best approach 
actually combines all three components.
The feedback that you provide is a critical part of the process, 
but it isn’t necessarily the first step in the annual performance 
appraisal. You can build a better foundation for your feedback 
by first gathering performance data from two other workplace 
sources: the employee who is about to be evaluated, and the 
employee’s associates.
In this chapter, I walk you through each of the three types of 
evaluations, showing you how they work together to give you 
the full picture of an employee’s performance.
Feedback from the Employee: 
Self-Evaluations
One of the most powerful ways to open the evaluation pro-
cess is to have your employees do a self-evaluation. There is 

nothing complicated about this step. All you need to do is 
give the employee a blank copy of the exact form that you’re 
using and ask her to complete it for herself.
Encourage her to truly think about her performance during 
the year and to be totally honest and forthright. In addition, 
let her know that you’ll be carefully looking over her self-
evaluation and you’ll be considering her ratings and com-
ments when determining her performance appraisal.
 
Be sure to tell your employees that this isn’t a bargaining 
game, where their 5 and your 3 for the same factor average 
out to a 4. They should be as honest as possible and not 
overrate themselves to try to balance out a low score they 
expect to receive from you.
Some companies exclude the self-evaluation step altogether, 
while others merely recommend it. If your company offers 
the option to include self-evaluations, seize the opportunity 
and ask all your employees to evaluate themselves. The 
advantages of self-evaluations cover a broad spectrum:
 
✓ They demystify the process. When employees sit 
down and complete the same evaluation form that you’ll 
be using, any mystery in the process is immediately 
wiped out.
 
✓ They help employees focus their behavior. The better 
employees truly understand the criteria on which they’re 
being judged, the better they’re able to target their 
efforts on the job.
 
✓ They send a motivational message. Employees view 
the opportunity to evaluate themselves as an indicator 
of respect and trust and as a sign that their ideas and 
inputs are important and valued — all of which motivates 
them to work harder and care more.
 
✓ They improve communications. Your understanding 
of your employees’ appraisals leads to a more open, 
focused, and effective discussion when you meet 
with them.
 
If you’ve given an employee a low rating on a factor that he 
sees as an area of significant accomplishment and success, 
the discussion can become tense, argumentative, and 
sidetracked. By reviewing an employee’s self-evaluation 
Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
34
Feedback from the Employee: Self-Evaluations

 Chapter 3: The Types of Performance Appraisals 35
Feedback from Others: 360-Degree Feedback
in advance, you’ll be able to either prepare for this difference 
of opinion or make an adjustment in this particular rating 
(for example, if you somehow overlooked some compelling 
aspects of the employee’s performance).
 
Especially revealing are the areas in which you’ve rated your 
employees higher than they’ve rated themselves. Don’t lower 
your rating just because you came in higher than your 
employees. Instead, discuss this point with them — it’s a 
great opportunity to provide recognition and support.
 
The way in which employees approach self-evaluations is 
quite revealing. Whether they realize it or not, self-evaluations 
are actually work assignments. Employees who simply plug in 
all the same scores and make no effort to elaborate on their 
ratings are giving you additional insight into their work ethic, 
attitude, and motivation.
Feedback from Others: 
360-Degree Feedback
You can learn a great deal about the performance, productivity, 
and overall effectiveness of your employees by gathering feed-
back from selected associates at work.
Known as 360-degree feedback, this evaluative technique pro-
vides employees with performance-based feedback from a 
dozen or so anonymous raters in the workplace — including 
peers, subordinates, additional members of management, 
customers, and vendors — all of whom have had work-related 
dealings with the employees being evaluated.
These raters are asked to complete questionnaires that focus 
on the performance of individual employees. There is no 
single and widely accepted form or format for 360-degree 
feedback, and the approach varies in terms of areas probed, 
numbers of questions, and types of questions.
Some of the forms that the evaluating individuals complete 
are lengthy questionnaires with hundreds of questions, while 
other forms have fewer than 20 questions. Some forms are 
developed and implemented internally, while other forms are 
the work of outside experts.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
36
Feedback from You
 
The underlying premise of 360-degree feedback is that if one 
manager can gather meaningful data about an employee from 
the top-down angle, a significant amount of additional perfor-
mance data can be gathered by looking at an individual from 
all the other angles and degrees.
A professionally operated 360-degree feedback program can 
be an excellent source of feedback for whoever is being 
evaluated. But what to do with this feedback is hotly debated 
among human resources experts. Some experts contend that 
360-degree feedback should be part of an employee’s formal 
appraisal, while others contend that such data should be 
limited to employee development.
The resolution to this conundrum is for you to carefully 
consider any 360-degree feedback that you obtain as part of 
the performance appraisal process and use it as a source of 
additional data but not as a key factor in determining ratings. 
Because you’ve been managing by wandering around and 
providing your employees with ongoing coaching, feedback, 
and guidance, you already have a clear idea of their perfor-
mance. The data from 360-degree feedback can help support 
the ratings that you provide.
Besides, employees tend to be receptive to feedback from 
their peers and others at work when such information is 
used for training and development, but they tend to be less 
comfortable with the prospect of having peers and other indi-
viduals impacting their evaluations, raises, or promotions.
Feedback from You
Several performance appraisal systems exist, from classic to 
cutting-edge. Some of these systems work better than others, 
and there is some overlap among the various systems. The 
most successful systems are tailored to the companies in 
which they’re used. No matter what performance appraisal 
approach your company uses, there is one element that can 
make any of them work better, and that element is you.
 
If you do all the following, you’re likely to generate highly 
effective evaluations:

✓ Keep the evaluation process transparent.
 
✓ Jointly establish fair and challenging objectives.

✓ Use meaningful and appropriate phrases when providing 
feedback.
In this section, I cover the various types of appraisal systems 
your company may use.
Writing essays
If the word essay gives you the same queasy feeling that 
you had in high school English class, you’re not alone. 
Essays were among the earliest performance evaluation 
techniques — and they’re among the most trying as well.
As the name implies, this approach consists of little more 
than a manager’s written overall opinion of each employee’s 
performance. Under this system, when the end of the year 
rolls around, a manager is typically handed a form that reads 
something like, “Please evaluate your employee’s perfor-
mance during the year.” The rest of the page is blank — 
and, interestingly enough, so is the manager’s face. Armed 
with little more than a hint of guidance, the manager writes 
whatever comes to mind.
For managers who find writing to be a chore, and evaluations 
to be a bore, the write-up typically contains a few scribbled 
points that may or may not relate to the employees’ perfor-
mance. Such comments are generally off the cuff, off the top 
of their heads, and, as a result, off target. There is no reason 
to assume that such information will have even a hint of 
accuracy, relevance, or usefulness to employees.
The situation isn’t much better for managers who are more 
verbose. They may fill up the page with words, but all of it 
may be irrelevant. The form doesn’t provide a framework for 
them to follow, nor are they given any direction regarding 
rating criteria and focus. As a result, their essays tend to 

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
38
Feedback from You
be filled with impressions, biases, distortions, and rambling 
comments that run far astray from the real meaning of 
performance appraisal.
Whether the essay-writer is terse or wordy, you can only 
imagine what a one-on-one session with the evaluated 
employee would be like. With the essay written by the 
minimalist, the evaluated employee will feel short-changed, 
ignored, and insulted. And in the session conducted 
by the purported wordsmith, the evaluated employee 
will be instantly defensive and ready to argue each point 
vociferously. Neither scenario sets the stage for an open 
discussion in which actual performance, behaviors, and 
outcomes are discussed and reviewed.
 
When an evaluation form provides no structure in terms of 
topics, techniques, and criteria, the raters can provide highly 
impressionistic feedback that can easily wander far from work 
itself. This type of form can lead to biased and discriminatory 
comments (whether intentional or not), which can lead to 
legal problems for the company.
There is still a place for essays in the evaluation process — 
but not lengthy diatribes, and not at center stage. Instead, 
today’s essays should be short, focused, and performance-
related, and they should be provided along with your rating 
or ranking of your employees. At the heart of these mini-
essays are the specific, targeted, job-related phrases that are 
among the most powerful tools for performance appraisal and 
improvement — the kinds of phrases I provide in Part III of 
this book.
Using graphic rating scales
Graphic rating scales are among the most common tools 
in the performance appraisal process. They typically contain 
a list of the following, which employees demonstrate on 
the job:
 
✓ Traits and characteristics: Traits and characteristics 
are parts of an employee’s personality. As such, they 
tend to be quite stable and unlikely to change over time, 
especially as the result of a performance appraisal.

 Chapter 3: The Types of Performance Appraisals 39
Feedback from You
 
 Rating scales that focus on traits and characteristics 
tend to run into trouble. Traits and characteristics 
are difficult to identify, measure, and evaluate, and 
there isn’t much an employee can do with feedback in 
this area. For example, when you give an employee 
a low rating in “self-esteem,” she can’t go back to her 
workstation and start working on that.
 
✓ Competencies: Competencies are the overarching, 
measurable, and observable attributes deemed neces-
sary for successful performance on the job. Depending 
upon the position, they can include such topics as 
knowledge, supervisory skills, communication, and 
problem solving.
 
✓ Actions and behaviors: Actions and behaviors are the 
specific, observable, and measurable behaviors that 
employees have taken in the course of carrying out their 
job responsibilities. Feedback in this area is factual and 
performance-based. This type of feedback is easier for 
employees to understand, accept, and act upon.
 
✓ Results: Results are the benchmarks, outputs, and objec-
tives that your employees achieve. Feedback in this area 
is clear, specific, measurable, accurate, and based upon 
the employees’ meeting specific agreed-upon standards. 
Appraisals that focus on objectives are easier for you to 
structure, because the data speaks for itself. At the same 
time, appraisals in this area help employees focus their 
attention on the right targets, which can be motivational 
as well.
The forms usually include a numerical scale, often from 1 to 5, 
indicating whether the employee is outstanding, excellent, 
competent, marginal, or unsatisfactory in each described area.
Some of these forms also include a section where you 
can write comments and phrases to further describe the 
employee’s performance. This is where you would include 
specific examples, supporting data, and meaningful phrases 
to support the ratings you provide (see Part III).
 
Graphic rating scales offer several advantages:

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
40
Feedback from You
 
✓ The forms are easy to design for most organizations.
 
✓ The forms have a clear rating scale, with a description of 
the level of performance associated with each numerical 
ranking.
 
✓ The forms are easy to complete, and they don’t take 
much time.
One main problem with graphic rating scales occurs when 
they focus on traits and characteristics rather than perfor-
mance. Other problems are caused by errors that managers 
make when completing these forms (see Chapter 7).
Choosing checklists
Another basic evaluation method relies on checklists, the 
most common of which is a broad listing of work-related 
behaviors, characteristics, and outcomes. With this list in 
hand, you place a checkmark indicating “yes” or “no” next to 
any of the descriptors that apply to the employee who is 
being evaluated.
A variation on this method is the weighted checklist. This 
approach uses the same process, but the descriptors in the 
checklist are given different values based on their role and 
importance in the employee’s position.
In either case, you total the scores and determine the 
employee’s overall rating.
The checklists approach is a quick way to evaluate an 
employee. It can be used to evaluate employees in any position.
At the same time, the checklists approach has some 
noticeable deficiencies:
 
✓ It’s incomplete. Some key outcomes and performance 
measures can be missing from the checklist, while other 
measures don’t lend themselves to the simplicity of a 
“yes” or “no” response.
 
✓ It’s uncontrolled. Without specific performance 
indicators, various biases can enter the equation.

✓ It’s muddled in the middle. Managers can encounter addi-
tional difficulties when using this approach for employees 
who are neither stars nor strugglers — people who fall 
somewhere in between a definite “yes” or “no” response.
Forcing the choice
Some managers have the tendency to give many employees 
the same ratings, whether positive, neutral, or negative. 
Although this problem can be addressed by training, some 
employers opt for an appraisal method called forced choice.
Under the forced choice approach, managers use a list that 
contains several groupings of four statements. Each of the 
four statements describes a work-related behavior. Developed 
through careful prior analysis (typically conducted by outside 
specialists), two of these statements (the weighted ones) are 
most typical of the performance of excellent employees, and 
the other two statements are unrelated to the performance of 
excellent employees. However, they all look equally positive 
to the manager doing the evaluation.
For each grouping of four statements, you select any two 
statements that appear to best describe the employee you’re 
evaluating. When you select either or both weighted state-
ments, the employee’s appraisal score is increased. When you 
select the non-weighted statements, there is no impact on the 
employee’s score.
The good news is that there is greater objectivity when you 
don’t really know how positively or negatively you’re rating 
your employees. Without the influence or distraction of 
specific rating scales, you’re more likely to focus on behaviors 
rather than scoring. Plus, this method eliminates the tendency 
to give all employees the same rating.
Still, there are some downsides to consider:
 
✓ The actual process of determining the groupings of 
statements calls for considerable technical expertise, 
which can be costly.
 
✓ This approach can leave out some of the specific 
behaviors associated with the quality and quantity of 
an employee’s work or attainment of goals.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
42

✓ The process can be annoying to complete, especially 
when managers feel forced to select an inaccurate option 
when none of the statements applies.
When the design of an evaluation form overlooks important 
behaviors and provides no leeway for a manager to tailor his 
responses, the most likely outcome is an evaluation session 
that is uncomfortable for the manager and his employees.
Ranking employees
Referred to as multi-person comparison methods, these 
appraisal strategies match each employee’s performance 
with that of her peers and then generates a rank order 
from top to bottom.
In some cases, comparing employees can be based on 
any number of criteria conjured up by the managers them-
selves. In fact, it can be as basic as asking managers to 
rank their employees from the best to the worst. In other 
cases, the ranking process and strategy can be more focused, 
structured, and sophisticated.
 
Multi-person comparisons work best when you have 
large departments or groupings of employees in the same 
evaluation unit.
Forced distribution
The forced distribution approach is a lot like that high school 
or college class you had that was graded on a curve. In the 
workplace, the manager doing the evaluating is supposed 
to look at each employee’s performance, compare it to 
the performance of the employee’s peers, and then place 
each employee in an appropriate percentile grouping — 
slotting the top 5 percent to 10 percent in the “excellent” 
group, the bottom 5 percent to 10 percent in the “poor” 
group, 15 percent in the “fair” group, 15 percent in the “very 
good” group, and the balance in the “competent” group.
 
Some companies believe in the forced distribution approach 
so strongly that they terminate employees who land in the 
bottom group.

 Chapter 3: The Types of Performance Appraisals 43
Feedback from You
Here are the advantages of forced distribution:
 
✓ It eliminates the possibility of a manager giving all 
employees similar or equal ratings, whether unduly low 
or unduly high. By definition, the evaluations are going 
be spread out from highest to lowest, even if the range is 
quite narrow.
 
✓ The forced distribution scale forces managers to put 
some serious thought into their evaluations.
 
✓ This approach is more likely to highlight the real factors 
that are used to measure success in a company.
 
✓ Some employers contend that this approach leads to 
higher-caliber employees, especially if the bottom ranks 
are eliminated each year.
On the flip side, here are some of the drawbacks to the forced 
distribution approach:
 
✓ It can have a negative impact on teamwork because 
employees sense that they should set aside any notion 
of working as a cohesive entity, and instead focus their 
attention on outdoing, outperforming, and outshining 
their co-workers whenever possible.
 
✓ If the program is used for several years, the bottom 
10 percent has been getting better and better, and the 
prospect of continuing to eliminate employees in this 
grouping can have a chilling effect across the company.
 
✓ This approach may not be successful in laying the appro-
priate groundwork for employee development and growth.
Pairing up
A second well-known multi-person comparison method is 
called paired comparisons. With this approach, the manager 
pairs an employee with another person in his department 
or work unit; then he looks at the pairing and chooses the 
better performer from the pair. He pairs the better employee 
with another employee in the department, and evaluates that 
pair to see who is the better performer. As employees con-
tinue to be matched up in pairs with each other, the manager 
continues to choose the better performing individual.

Part I: When It’s Time to Appraise Your Employees 
44
Feedback from You
When all the possible pairings and selections have been 
made, it’s time to total things up. Employees who are selected 
more frequently move toward the top of the list, while those 
who are selected less frequently drop toward the bottom. 
Ultimately, there is a rank ordering of employees from the 
highest to the lowest. Those at the top receive the top 
rewards, such as raises, while those at the lower end receive 
lower-level rewards, if any at all.
This approach prevents all employees from getting the same 
ranking, and it can be used in many departments across a 
company.
 
At the same time, this process can easily be subjective, and 
factors other than performance can leak into the mix. In fact, 
popularity can play a greater role than performance.
Finding critical incidents
Critical incidents are a special category of employee behaviors 
that focus on two distinct areas: particularly outstanding 
behaviors and particularly questionable behaviors. The criti-
cal incidents method of performance appraisal is based 
on managers spending time during the year observing and 
gathering behavioral data on their employees, while looking 
extra carefully for those critical incidents.
At the end of the year, the managers take out all their notes 
on these critical incidents and categorize them as either 
positive/satisfactory behaviors or negative/unsatisfactory 
behaviors. An employee’s rating is then heavily influenced 
or even determined by which pile of data is taller — the 
satisfactory or the unsatisfactory.
Here are the advantages of the critical incidents approach to 
performance appraisal:
 
✓ It’s based on direct observations. The greatest strength 
of this approach is that performance evaluations are 
based on actual performance that is observed firsthand 
by the employee’s manager.
 
✓ It’s time-tested. In this approach, managers gather data 
over a full year, so it’s less likely to be influenced by a mad 
last-minute scurry for data or the undue impact that can 
be associated with an employee’s most recent behaviors.

 Chapter 3: The Types of Performance Appraisals 45
Feedback from You
 
✓ It provides more face time. By definition, the critical 
incident approach encourages managers to spend time 
on the floors with their employees, which allows them to 
provide more coaching, guidance, and feedback, while 
also learning more about overall developments in the 
department
On the other hand, the critical incidents approach has some 
drawbacks:
 
✓ It delays the giving of feedback. In order for feedback to 
be truly effective (whether the feedback is positive or 
negative), it should be linked as closely as possible to the 
behavior in question. With critical incidents, a greater 
emphasis may be placed on gathering data and tallying it 
than actually using it to inform, educate, and motivate 
employees.
 
 As the distance between behavior and feedback 
increases, the value of feedback decreases.
 
✓ All satisfactory and unsatisfactory behaviors are not 
equal. Throughout the year, a person may display 
many excellent behaviors but only one unsatisfactory 
behavior. In that case, her pile of satisfactory behaviors 
would be much greater than her pile of unsatisfactory 
behaviors. But weighing the number of satisfactory 
behaviors against the number of unsatisfactory ones 
can lead to an erroneous conclusion if the one unsatisfac-
tory behavior cost the company its best client, or its 
computer system, or its line of credit.
 
 In order to increase the accuracy and utility of the 
critical incident method, managers who use it should 
attach a numerical value to each positive and negative 
behavior.
 
✓ Although managers should engage in managing by 
wandering around, the critical incident approach can 
cause managers to spend too much time on the floors. If 
the manager is constantly wandering around with his 
employees, the employees can start to feel as though the 
team is being micromanaged.

Using rating scales 
tied to behavior
Instead of relying on behaviors that can be appraised in 
any position in a company, one well-known appraisal 
method takes the process into a different arena and bases 
evaluations on specific behaviors required for each individual 
position in an individual company. This approach is known 
as behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS).
Development of BARS evaluations requires an in-depth under-
standing of each position’s key tasks, along with an understand-
ing of the full range of behaviors displayed by individuals in 
carrying out such tasks. You rate these behaviors for each 
employee; then you anchor each behavior to points on a 
rating scale, which indicates whether the behavior is excep-
tional, excellent, fully competent, or unsatisfactory. The result 
is a rating scale for each task.
For example, in a hypothetical position of human resources 
coordinator, one of the job holder’s responsibilities is to 
complete status change notices, which update the personnel 
system regarding changes in employee pay, position, title, 
supervisor, and personal data. The BARS method for this 
specific task in this specific job could read as follows:
 
5 — Exceptional performance: Accurately completes 
and submits all status change notices within an hour of 
request.
 
4 — Excellent performance: Verifies all status change 
notice information with requesting manager before 
submitting.
 
3 — Fully competent performance: Completes status 
change notice forms by the end of the workday.
 
2 — Marginal performance: Argues when asked to 
complete a status change notice.
 
1 — Unsatisfactory performance: Says status change 
notice forms have been submitted when they haven’t.

The BARS approach offers several key advantages:
 
✓ It’s behaviorally based. The BARS system is totally 
focused on employee performance. Ideally, it removes 
all uncertainty regarding the meaning of each numerical 
rating.
 
✓ It’s easy to use. The clear behavioral indicators make the 
process easier for the manager to carry out and the 
employee to accept.
 
✓ It’s equitable. With its heavy emphasis on behavior, the 
evaluation process comes across as fair.
 
✓ It’s fully individualized. From the standpoint of consis-
tency within a company, BARS is designed and applied 
individually and uniquely for every position.
 
✓ It’s action-oriented. With an understanding of the spe-
cific performance expectations and standards of excel-
lence, employees can much more easily take steps to 
improve their performance, and they’re more likely to do 
so as a result.
Like any method, BARS isn’t perfect. Here are some of the 
drawbacks to the BARS approach:
 
✓ The process of creating and implementing BARS is 
time-consuming, difficult, and expensive. Each BARS 
form must be created from scratch for every position in 
the company.
 
✓ Sometimes the listed behaviors still don’t include 
certain actions required of the employee, so managers 
can have difficulty assigning a rating.
 
✓ It’s high maintenance. Jobs change over time, which 
means that BARS requires a high degree of monitoring 
and maintenance.
 
✓ It’s demanding of managers. In order to successfully 
conduct BARS evaluations, managers need detailed 
information regarding the actions of their employees. 
Gathering such data can be quite time-consuming, and 
many managers end up letting this slide.

Managing by objectives
Another well-regarded and widely used approach to perfor-
mance appraisal is called management by objectives 
(MBO). By definition, under this method, you evaluate your 
employees on the basis of results.
MBO is more than performance appraisal — it’s a construct 
for managing the entire organization. Its breadth includes 
the organization’s vision, values, strategies, goals, and perfor-
mance measurement.
MBO begins with managers at the top of the company setting 
goals. Then managers and employees at each successively 
lower level develop their own goals. Employees’ goals are 
designed to support the goals of their own managers. In this 
way, the entire organization is linked together in the pursuit 
of objectives.
 
The focus is on outcomes that are clear, specific, measurable, 
and supported by action plans, benchmark dates, and dead-
lines. All aspects of the goal-setting process also apply to 
the employees’ personal and developmental goals, such as 
building their skills or knowledge base.
After employees meet with their managers to establish 
their goals and action plans, the employees return to work 
newly energized and focused on specific short-term and 
longer-term targets. Simultaneously, their managers monitor 
the employees’ performance, provide coaching and support, 
remove barriers or help employees overcome them, and 
make adjustments and course corrections as necessary. The 
employees’ performance and progress are clear, measured, 
documented, and transparent every step of the way.
 
Employees are highly motivated through MBO because 
they’ve been able to actively participate in the process of 
setting goals, instead of simply having the goals dumped on 
them. Their involvement in this type of decision making helps 
meet many of their higher-level needs for accomplishment, 
achievement, recognition, and self-worth.

When the time arrives for the annual appraisal, there is no 
mystery or surprise in the evaluation — a plus both for 
managers and the employees they’re evaluating. With MBO, 
employees clearly know how they’ve been doing along the 
way because they’ve been given regular managerial feedback 
starting from the point when the objectives were originally 
set. Because employees know where they stand, they aren’t 
likely to be resistant, argumentative, or defensive.
As part of the annual appraisal process, employees and their 
managers establish objectives for the coming year, and the 
cycle starts anew.
 
MBO brings a wide range of advantages to the appraisal 
process:
 
✓ It helps build relationships between managers and 
employees. MBO includes a great deal of contact and 
communication between managers and their employees, 
which builds camaraderie, communication, and trust — 
all key elements in strengthening teamwork.
 
✓ It fosters a comfortable climate in the workplace. MBO 
helps build an atmosphere of respect and trust within a 
given department and beyond.
 
✓ Because managers work directly with employees to 
identify and solve problems, MBO improves the quality 
of decision making and problem solving.
 
✓ It’s fair. Employees are evaluated on the basis of their 
performance and attainment of goals, which is regarded 
as fair and energizing.
 
✓ It’s quick and easy. Performance evaluation forms 
associated with MBO are a breeze to complete. Typically, 
they spell out each objective as established at the 
beginning of the cycle, and then provide a space for the 
manager to summarize the results.
Some MBO forms also include a scale that asks for a numeri-
cal assessment of the employees’ success in meeting their 
goals. These scales guide the managers in the rating process 
by including specific descriptions of excellent, good, fair, and 
poor levels of goal attainment.

W
ith so many appraisal forms, techniques, and strat-
egies at your command, you can easily become 
sidetracked and overlook the most important element in the 
entire performance evaluation process: you!
Researchers continue to find that, although it’s obviously 
important for companies to select and implement performance 
appraisal systems that match their culture, style, and stan-
dards, the individual who conducts the evaluations is the key 
factor in determining the effectiveness of the system itself.
 
Think of your company’s performance appraisal system as a 
car — in fact, think of it as a high-performance car. And think 
of yourself as the driver. If you’re not driving the car or the 
appraisal process, neither will go very far.
Building Your Evaluation 
Mindset
Before you start looking at your employees, you need to look 
at yourself. In order to provide the most relevant, compelling, 
credible, and effective appraisals, you need a mindset that 
is fully supportive of the process. Managers who approach 
performance appraisal as a ritual, a chore, or an isolated 
event undercut their own effectiveness before they even start.

To have the right mindset, you need to:
 
✓ See yourself as a leader.
 
✓ Set positive expectations.
 
✓ Overcome your own fear, reluctance, and resistance.
 
✓ Gain self-awareness.
 
✓ Empathize with your employees.
With this foundation in place, you’ll be in a much better 
position to understand and analyze your employees’ perfor-
mance and, ultimately, to help each individual achieve 
greater productivity, growth, and satisfaction.
Seeing yourself as a leader
One of the primary reasons that managers struggle with the 
performance evaluation process is that they haven’t mentally 
crossed the bridge to management. Perhaps they were pro-
moted over their workplace friends, maybe even long ago, but 
they still see themselves as part of the old group rather than 
as a member of management.
These managers are the ones who don’t want to give their 
employees any negative feedback because they’re afraid that 
their friendships will be disrupted. For these managers, being 
liked is more important than being a leader.
 
If you’re concerned about upsetting your employees because 
you have to deliver negative performance-related feedback, 
you haven’t fully crossed that bridge to management. And 
until you do so, the evaluation process is going to be uncom-
fortable for you and meaningless for your employees.
Managers who want to be effective leaders while simultane-
ously remaining buddies with their employees find that these 
two desires don’t mix. By continuing to play the buddy card, 
they undermine their influence, power, and ability to guide 
the team to meet its goals. Plus, instead of coming across as 
likable, managers who act this way appear weak.

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 55
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
 
A manager needs to act like a manager, and that includes 
providing employees with honest, accurate, job-related feed-
back, especially during the performance appraisal process. 
Acting like a manager generates something more important 
than popularity: It generates respect — and managers who 
are respected tend to be well liked.
 
Unless you see yourself as a manager, your employees won’t 
see you as one — and they won’t accept or act on the informa-
tion you give them during the performance appraisal.
Setting positive expectations
Your expectations are directly linked to your employees’ per-
formance and, hence, to the performance appraisal process 
itself. Why? Because your expectations have a measurable 
impact on how your employees ultimately perform on the job. 
Not only do you need to have accurate expectations, but the 
expectations you set for your employees need to be positive.
If you expect an employee to perform poorly, you telegraph 
that expectation in many subtle and not-so-subtle ways:
 
✓ On the subtle side, your body language can clearly 
signal your negative expectations. You may have the 
perpetual hint of a frown when communicating with the 
employee. Your brow may be furrowed, your arms may 
be crossed, and you may even shake your head in an 
almost imperceptible way.
 
✓ On the not-so-subtle side, you may talk and behave 
in a way that clearly communicates your negative 
expectations. You may speak curtly; frequently use the 
word no in your comments; give better assignments to 
other employees; and give minimal signs of thanks, 
appreciation, and recognition.
 
Your employees pick up all these cues — whether subtle or 
obvious. They internalize your cues and act accordingly, which 
leads to negative attitudes and diminished performance.
At the same time, when you expect your employees to do 
well, you deal with them in an enthusiastic, upbeat, and 
supportive style. You tend to smile and nod more, and your 
speech is likely to be more animated and filled with the word 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
56
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
yes, as well as with encouraging phrases. The work you assign 
and the feedback you provide tell the employees that they’re 
terrific, and they respond with terrific performance.
 
Think of expectations as self-fulfilling prophecies.
 
Your expectations have a major impact on your employees’ 
performance and ultimately on the evaluations that you 
conduct.
As you prepare yourself to appraise your employees, think of 
your employees as individuals, and then consider the expecta-
tions that you’ve established for each one of them. You’ll find 
that the employees for whom you have low expectations are, 
indeed, the weaker performers, while the better performers 
are the employees for whom you have high expectations.
 
The annual performance appraisal is a perfect time to take a 
careful look at your expectations for all your employees and 
then commit to building more positive expectations for each 
of them. Be sure to express positive expectations during the 
performance appraisal process.
Overcoming fear, reluctance, 
and resistance
When you’re confronted with the prospect of several perfor-
mance appraisals looming on the horizon, you may feel queasy. 
In fact, some of the more common reactions that managers have 
to performance appraisals are fear, reluctance, and resistance.
 
If you’re experiencing any of these emotions, the best way to 
dig yourself out of them is to dig into them. After all, if you carry 
these feelings into the performance appraisal process, they’ll 
carry you and the process far from where you want to go.
Eliminating fear
Fear is an emotion that is aroused by imminent danger — 
whether real or imagined. In the case of performance 
appraisals, fear belongs in the imagined file. Instead of 
sensing that there may be significant danger in the various 
stages of the appraisal process, managers have more 
mundane fears that can hold them back, such as:

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 57
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
 
✓ A fear of looking foolish: Managers who have this fear 
are primarily concerned that their ratings, comments, 
and face-to-face appraisal sessions will put them in 
situations that highlight their lack of knowledge, lack of 
accurate information, and even lack of managerial skills.
 
✓ A fear of confrontation: Some managers are also afraid 
that their one-on-one sessions with their employees 
will turn into arguments and disagreements. Instead of 
opening the door to these encounters, some managers 
simply opt to provide unwarranted positive reviews to 
avoid confrontation. Unfortunately, these reviews don’t 
do anyone any good.
 
Providing undeserved positive reviews in order to avoid a 
confrontation doesn’t qualify as a method of overcoming fear. 
Actually, it’s a method of surrendering to fear.
Fortunately, there are two major steps that you can take to 
help yourself overcome your fears about conducting perfor-
mance appraisals:
 
✓ Spend more face time with your team. Not only will this 
strategy help you gather the factual, specific, and job-
related performance data you need to create and provide 
a valid evaluation, but it will demonstrate to your 
employees that you aren’t pulling data out of thin air.
 
 In every respect, your firsthand knowledge provides you 
with first-rate confidence.
 
✓ Become an expert in your company’s performance 
appraisal system. If you’re thumbing through the 
documents and rating forms the night before an 
evaluation, you’re likely to miss key points, emphasize 
the wrong points, and move in a direction that has 
nothing to do with the evaluation or its objectives. Plus, 
your employees will react negatively to any or all of 
these indiscretions, bringing out the very behaviors 
that you fear.
 
A key source of fear is a perceived lack of power. When you 
have in-depth knowledge of your employees’ performance and 
the appraisal system, your fears will be alleviated — because 
knowledge is power.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
58
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
 
Just as your expectations about your employees’ performance 
will strongly influence how they ultimately perform, the same 
applies to your expectations about how the performance 
appraisal process will go. If you enter the process expecting 
an embattled exchange, that’s precisely what you’re likely 
to get. On the other hand, if you approach the process with 
positive expectations, it’s far more likely to go well.
Eliminating reluctance
Managers who are reluctant to provide performance reviews 
aren’t necessarily afraid of conducting appraisals. They’re just 
hesitant, tentative, and likely to defer the process until a later 
date — a much later date.
One of the primary sources of this reluctance stems directly 
from a manager’s prior experiences with performance 
evaluations — both the kind they gave to other employees 
and the kind they received from their own managers:
 
✓ Problems with reviews you gave: If you’ve had difficul-
ties providing performance appraisals in the past, you’re 
likely to feel reluctant to give another appraisal now. 
Perhaps you gave reviews based on information that 
wasn’t fully substantiated, or maybe you had to give an 
employee a negative review when he expected a great 
review. Either way, the outcome most likely was conflict. 
And now you’re reluctant to enter the ring again. That 
reaction is a normal one — after all, you don’t want to 
repeat a less-than-pleasant situation.
 
✓ Problems with reviews you received: You can also 
experience reluctance about conducting performance 
appraisals if you had a particularly dissatisfying experi-
ence when you were on the receiving end of an appraisal. 
Perhaps you had a manager who evaluated you unfairly 
or focused on traits and characteristics that had nothing 
to do with your performance. Because you don’t want to 
put your employees through this type of ordeal, you’re 
reluctant to appraise them at all.
By definition, reluctance is not an absolute refusal to conduct 
the process. Instead, it’s a hesitancy to do so until you reach 
more of a comfort zone. You can take a couple of key steps 
that can help you get to that place of comfort:

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 59
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
 
✓ Set goals for yourself. When you carry out most of 
your other managerial functions, you establish specific 
objectives, strategies, and deadlines — do likewise 
for performance appraisals. Try to determine the 
measurable outcomes that you’d like to achieve from 
this process, and spell them out in specific terms. 
These objectives can focus on actual improvements in 
employee performance, upgrading of employee skills, 
and achieving greater results.
 
 When you include specific objectives and an action plan 
as part of each appraisal, your reluctance will decrease. 
You’re implementing the appraisal process similarly to 
your other managerial functions.
 
✓ Practice. A second important way to overcome reluc-
tance is to build your appraisal skills. One way to do 
this is to conduct a mock evaluation session with one 
of your fellow managers or your company’s human 
resources (HR) representative. The practice will increase 
your comfort level with the process, and the feedback 
provided in this mock session will help fine-tune your 
skills and confidence.
Eliminating resistance
When managers resist performance appraisals, they flat-out 
oppose it. Typically, resistance doesn’t have anything to do 
with being afraid. Instead, managers who resist appraisals 
tend to believe that the process is an unnecessary intrusion 
on their time or that it doesn’t provide them with useful 
results.
When some managers first look at performance appraisal 
materials, their brains go immediately into overload. The 
result is that they either close the file or set the pile aside. 
This step, also known as avoidance, does nothing to help 
them. In fact, although they may physically remove the perfor-
mance appraisal materials, they still know that the appraisals 
must be completed. And whenever that thought resurfaces, 
the queasy feeling returns, along with another round of 
avoidance.
For some managers, conducting real performance appraisals 
is very different from what they’ve been doing in the past, 
which leads to additional resistance — they want to avoid 
change. (See the “Resistance to change” sidebar for more on 
this topic.)

Building Your Evaluation Mindset
If you find that your approach to the performance appraisal 
process is best described as resistance, you can take two key 
steps to help remove this barrier:
 
✓ Consider the advantages. Instead of approaching the 
appraisal process as a time-consuming exercise with 
minimal usefulness, take a look at the potentially positive 
outcomes associated with it, especially in terms of 
advantages for you. For example, with a well-tuned 
appraisal process, your employees are likely to be 
more satisfied, energized, and productive, which means 
that your department will be more successful.
 
 At the same time, if you resist the process, the likelihood 
of these outcomes will diminish, and you’ll be forced 
to spend more time trying to focus and motivate your 
Resistance to change
Some managers resist performance 
appraisals because appraisals call 
for a change in long-term and well-
established daily behaviors. It doesn’t 
take long for someone to say, “Well, 
it’s human nature to resist change.” 
But believe it or not, this may not be 
the case.
If you were told that you were going 
to experience a gigantic change in 
your life, a change so profound that it 
would definitely change your rela-
tionship with your employer, family, 
friends, and community at large, 
would you resist it? Well, it’s human 
nature to resist change, so the 
answer must be “yes,” right?
But what if this gigantic change is 
that you just won the state lottery 
and a cool $50 million? That’s proba-
bly a major change for you, but would 
you resist it? If not, how can it be 
human nature to resist change?
The answer is clear: Change itself is 
not automatically resisted. But 
people do resist the unknown ele-
ments of change. When a change is 
being introduced, people instantly 
wonder how it’ll impact them. And 
when the change is filled with 
unknowns, they resist it.
The best way to reduce resistance to 
change is to make the entire process 
more transparent. The more people 
know about the change, the more 
they’re able to make an intelligent 
judgment about the best way to 
react to it. This applies to any 
change that people encounter in life, 
including the actions that they’re 
expected to take in the course of 
a performance review. Taking the 
time to practice the evaluation pro-
cess is a great way to reduce your 
resistance to it.

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 61
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
team. In fact, you’re likely to spend more time on those 
efforts than you would have spent on the evaluation 
process.
 
✓ Demystify the process. Grab the appraisal materials by 
the horns and read them. One particularly effective 
strategy is to sit down with a couple of managers or 
even the HR representative and do a point-by-point run-
through. As you’ll no doubt find, the process is not as 
daunting as you thought. And as your familiarity and 
understanding increase, your resistance will decrease.
Gaining self-awareness
Effective performance appraisals require managers to have 
considerable insight into their employees, but this task is 
virtually impossible for managers who lack insight into them-
selves. When self-awareness is lacking, managers easily 
miss the main event when appraising their staff and focus 
on performance issues that are secondary, off the mark, or 
simply meaningless.
At the same time, self-awareness is a personality trait that 
employees and managers can’t just snap into place overnight. 
Upgrading skills in this area takes time, focus, and practice. 
Still, if you want to carry out excellent performance apprais-
als, you need to address your self-awareness and, if neces-
sary, do some building in this area.
One of the most valid and effective sources of information 
that can strengthen your self-awareness is the feedback that 
you’ve received over the years. Here’s the catch: If you’ve 
been in denial mode and deflected all negative feedback, 
you’ve blocked out information that could help you see your-
self more accurately, make some upgrades, and ultimately see 
others more accurately as well.
 
With that in mind, one of the best ways to build your self-
awareness is to carefully consider the feedback that you 
receive from the credible sources in your life. This doesn’t 
mean that you have to roll over every time someone says 
something about you that doesn’t sit well, but it does mean 
that you should truly listen to what others are saying and then 
try to make an honest judgment.

Building Your Evaluation Mindset
Walking the walk
One of the key ways in which your 
self-awareness directly impacts your 
performance appraisals is the extent 
to which you literally and figuratively 
“walk the walk” that you expect of 
your employees. The more you under-
stand yourself in this area, the more 
effective your evaluations will be.
For example, if you have a casual 
attitude toward safety and your 
employees are well aware of your 
lackadaisical comments and behav-
iors in this area you won’t have much 
credibility and impact if you try to 
emphasize safety when evaluating 
your employees. This applies to every 
component of the performance eval-
uations that you provide.
As a manager, you need to continu-
ously monitor the degree of consis-
tency between your behaviors and 
the standards you’re using to evalu-
ate your employees’ performance:
 ✓ Your self-evaluation: Regardless 
of whether your manager 
requires you to complete a self-
evaluation, do one — even if 
it’s just for yourself. This self-
evaluation will give you a hands-
on opportunity to see whether 
you’re truly performing at least at 
the level that you expect of your 
own employees. Go through 
every component of the evalua-
tion process and look honestly at 
your specific performance on 
each factor.
 ✓ Your support for the process: In 
order for your performance 
appraisals to have real signifi-
cance, you need to not only get 
actively behind them but also let 
your employees know that you’re 
doing so. If you make offhand 
negative comments about the 
appraisal process, or if your eval-
uations run late, your employees 
will respond in kind, not only ver-
bally but behaviorally.
 ✓ Your questions: In order to 
continue to build your self-
awareness, ask yourself the fol-
lowing key questions — and 
answer honestly. As you do so, 
the self-portrait you paint will 
help you see and evaluate the 
work of your employees more 
accurately.
 ✓ What are my greatest 
strengths and weaknesses?
 ✓ What am I most and least 
proud of at work?
 ✓ What is my greatest suc-
cess? What is my greatest 
failure?
 ✓ How would my manager 
describe me? How would my 
co-workers describe me? 
How would my employees 
describe me? How would 
my friends describe me? How 
would my family describe 
me?
 ✓ What steps am I taking to 
continue my growth and 
development?

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 63
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
If the feedback you receive starts to fall into a pattern or 
common theme, you should definitely give it a second 
thought, or even a third. In particular, pay attention to feed-
back from:
 
✓ Your manager: Part of your manager’s job is to observe 
and evaluate your performance, which requires her to 
learn a lot about you. Your manager probably gives 
you feedback throughout the year, as well as during 
your performance review. If you want to build your self-
awareness, take this feedback to heart.
 
✓ Your co-workers: Your fellow employees spend a lot 
of time with you every day. Some of the feedback they 
provide may come out during informal conversations, 
but you may also have the benefit of their insights 
through a 360-degree feedback program as well (see 
Chapter 3 for more on 360-degree feedback). Either way, 
your co-workers have lots of data on your personality 
and performance. Their comments, insights, and 
suggestions are definitely worth considering.
 
✓ Your friends: By definition, true friends are open and 
honest with each other, which means that they can 
provide you with feedback that can enhance your self-
awareness. When you’re with your friends, you’re free 
to be yourself — certainly more than you are in the 
workplace — which means that your friends see a much 
wider range of your behaviors. As a result, when friends 
give you feedback, it’s worth hearing.
 
✓ Your family: Your family knows you in an entirely 
different context, but — like it or not — your family 
does know you. For some people, feedback from family 
members is wrapped in so much emotional baggage 
that it’s difficult to accept. Nonetheless, if you truly want 
to build your self-awareness, try to set some of your 
own baggage aside and listen to what they have to say.
 
✓ Professionals: If you’ve taken any tests during the 
employment process — including tests in such areas as 
personality, math, reading, job knowledge and aptitudes, 
and even physical abilities — go back and look at that 
data. If you’ve ever met with a career counselor or 
mental health professional, take a second look at what he 
said to you as well. Because these are professional obser-
vations, they merit some extra observation from you.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
64
Building Your Evaluation Mindset
 
✓ Yourself: The messages that you give yourself will pro-
vide you with some of your most compelling self-insights. 
Maybe you’re too hard on yourself, or maybe you don’t 
expect enough from yourself. Either way, listen to what 
you say to yourself during the course of the day. Each 
message gives you one more piece of useful data.
 
If you pause to look at your behaviors and listen to your own 
messages, you can gain significant insight into your confi-
dence, self-image, ethics, attitude, self-control, communica-
tion skills, interpersonal skills, energy, and much more.
Empathizing with your employees
Empathy is the quality of sensing the feelings and thoughts of 
other people. As you may expect, empathy is a particularly 
valuable and desirable quality for any manager to have.
During the performance evaluation process, your ability to 
feel what your employees are feeling will help you craft 
written and verbal feedback that will be more meaningful 
and useful to them. When employees sense that you feel 
what they feel, their trust in you increases, as does their 
acceptance of your messages.
 
Managers who are low in empathy tend to resort to a one-size-
fits-all style of appraisal, but they soon find that this approach 
doesn’t fit at all.
Although you can’t develop empathy overnight, you can 
take some steps right away to upgrade your skills in this 
important area:
 
✓ Understand your own feelings. The better you under-
stand your own emotions and feelings, the better you’ll be 
able to experience the emotions and feelings of others. 
You can build your abilities in this area by stepping back 
and taking a good hard look at yourself in situations in 
which your emotions are actively in play. Feedback from 
the significant others in your work life and personal life 
can also help you strengthen these abilities.
 
✓ Widen your network. The more people you know, and 
the more varied and diverse the situations in which you 

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 65
Playing the “What If?” Game
place yourself, the greater your opportunities will be to 
enhance your ability to empathize with others. As you 
experience the ways in which others display empathy, 
you can learn from their examples and try to emulate 
their behaviors.
 
✓ Practice empathy. In the various interactions that you 
have with others, whether in the workplace or in your 
personal life, try to direct your thinking onto what other 
people may be feeling, sensing, and seeing.
 
The more you can see and experience the world from the 
perspective of those around you, the more compelling and 
effective your evaluations will be.
Playing the “What If?” Game
By identifying the most difficult questions that your employ-
ees can ask during the appraisal process, and then coming up 
with answers to those questions, you increase the likelihood 
that your evaluation sessions will be successful.
Many of today’s highly successful salespeople try to come up 
with the most difficult questions that a customer can ask and 
then develop solid answers to them. This is called the “What 
If?” game, and it applies to the performance appraisal process 
as well.
Being stunned by an employee’s questions isn’t pleasant; 
neither is stumbling around for answers. By reviewing some 
of the more frequent questions that employees ask during the 
face-to-face sessions, along with sample answers, you increase 
your likelihood of keeping your appraisal sessions on track 
and on target.
 
The following answers may not be perfect for your individual 
situation, but they can give you an idea of the direction to take:
Question: Why am I not getting a raise?
Answer: When you and I originally set goals for this year, 
we agreed that raises would depend on how successfully 
you met them.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
66
Planning and Scheduling
Question: Why is my raise so small?
Answer: Your raise is in line with what we talked about 
when we set up the goals.
Question: What did you rate Joe?
Answer: Everyone’s rating is confidential.
Question: I thought my performance was better than that. 
Why did you rate me so low?
Answer: I based the ratings on direct observations of 
your work that we talked about during the year. Let’s talk 
about the specific ratings that you feel are too low.
Question: Why don’t you like me?
Answer: Actually, I do like you. But your evaluation isn’t 
based on that. It’s based totally on your performance.
Question: Who told you I did that?
Answer: None of this is based on comments from any 
single person.
Question: Doesn’t loyalty count for anything?
Answer: Loyalty counts a lot, and you received strong 
ratings in areas that dealt with commitment and 
dedication.
Question: What do I need to do to get higher ratings?
Answer: Great question. Let’s talk about it.
As part of the performance evaluation process, meet with your 
fellow managers, discuss the most common and difficult kinds 
of questions they’ve faced during the evaluation sessions, and 
then work together to craft some excellent answers to each. 
This approach is the perfect way to play the “What If?” game.
Planning and Scheduling
As the time for the performance evaluation grows near, 
you need to move into an administrative role to handle the 
planning and scheduling of the process.

 Chapter 4: Getting Started 67
Planning and Scheduling
 
Set dates and times for all of the key benchmarks in the pro-
cess. One of the best ways to do this is to use a process called 
back-timing. With this approach, you establish the specific 
date that you want to conduct the sit-down session with each 
individual employee and then work backward to set up the 
benchmark dates for all the activities that need to occur prior 
to the meeting.
Start the process by contacting each employee at least six 
weeks ahead of the proposed date. For example, if you 
want to have your review sessions with your employees in 
mid-December, contact each of your employees by November 1 
to set up a mutually acceptable day and time for your 
one-on-one session.
When you and one of your employees have agreed on a date 
and time to meet, set up advance benchmark dates for that 
meeting to occur:
 
✓ Six weeks before the meeting (as soon as you’ve set 
up a date and time for the meeting): Meet with the 
employee, discuss the evaluation process, and give the 
employee the self-evaluation form. Advise the employee 
of the due date for this form (see “Four weeks before 
the meeting,” later in this list). Reserve a conference 
room if you don’t have a private office. If you’re using 
360-degree feedback (see Chapter 3), advise these 
individuals that you’ll need their input on this employee 
within two weeks.
 
✓ Five weeks before the meeting: Assemble all your 
performance data, notes, and documentation for the 
employee.
 
✓ Four weeks before the meeting: The employee returns 
her self-evaluation form to you. If you use 360-degree 
feedback, those forms are returned to you at this point 
as well.
 
✓ Two weeks before the meeting: Complete the review of 
your documentation, self-evaluation form, and 360-degree 
feedback.
 
✓ One week before the meeting: Complete the first draft of 
the employee’s evaluation. Review the recommended 
raise, if any.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
68
Planning and Scheduling
 
✓ Three days before the meeting: Finalize the raise, 
if any.
 
✓ Two days before the meeting: Finish the final draft of the 
employee’s evaluation. Plan the agenda for the meeting.
 
Be sure to put each of these benchmark dates on your calen-
dar. By setting specific dates for every step of the process, 
you’re able to give your employees the time and attention that 
they deserve for their performance appraisals.
Without planning ahead, you can easily let the time slide 
by. Then, all of a sudden, there are three days left and you 
haven’t even gathered all the information and documentation, 
let alone reviewed it and completed the evaluation materials. 
You can save yourself a lot of stress, and ensure that your 
performance appraisals are a success, by getting ready ahead 
of time.

M
ost managers understand the necessity of basing 
performance evaluations on workplace behaviors, 
competencies, and results. But there is less of a consensus 
and understanding of how to gather and analyze this informa-
tion. If you don’t pay enough attention to this part of the 
process, you end up with flawed performance data — and 
equally flawed evaluations.
The information that you need in order to precisely and 
productively evaluate your employees’ performance won’t 
suddenly appear on your desk. Gathering what you need for 
this process is a year-round responsibility, and handling 
it effectively helps not only in the performance evaluation 
process but also in the daily process of managing your 
employees.
Numerous workplace sources and resources provide the kind 
of information that’s essential for an accurate and meaningful 
performance appraisal. Of course, as important as these 
resources are, you’re the most important resource of all.

 
You’re at the center of the entire evaluation process for your 
employees. You’re most familiar with them, you’ve spent the 
most time observing them, you have access to more data 
about them than anyone else in the company, and you’re the 
one who will ultimately make sense of all the information and 
turn it into an accurate and relevant appraisal for each of your 
employees.
 
If you scrimp in the data-gathering phase, your evaluations 
will show it, and so will your employees’ reactions.
In this chapter, I show you the state-of-the-art methods to 
gather, analyze, and utilize the most important performance 
data on each of your employees.
Managing with All Your Senses
One of the most important ways to gather the kind of informa-
tion you need to appraise your employees’ performance is to 
manage by wandering around and spending time side by side 
with your employees as they do their work.
 
By intermittently visiting your team, you gather some excel-
lent firsthand performance data. Plus, you’re carrying out 
several key functions in the realm of performance manage-
ment (for example, providing coaching, guidance, support, 
and feedback right at the point when your employees need 
it most).
When you spend time working with your employees, you 
can easily get so caught up in their projects that you miss 
other subtle yet important developments that are occurring 
simultaneously. One key way to capture the less obvious, 
yet strikingly important, subtleties is to apply all of your 
senses to your managerial style. Together, your five senses — 
hearing, touch, taste, sight, and smell — play a key role in 
understanding the world around you, and that world includes 
the workplace. Even if one or more of your senses is impaired, 
your other senses still provide extremely valuable data.
 
Here’s how you can expand each of your senses:
 
✓ Hearing: When you meet with your employees, don’t 
just listen to what they’re saying. Listen to the speed of 
their delivery; the length of their sentences; and their 
Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
70
Managing with All Your Senses

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 71
Managing with All Your Senses
vocabulary, pitch, tone, and volume. Try to listen for 
any other sounds in the department, from disgruntled 
whispers to possibly malfunctioning equipment.
 
✓ Smell: Most managers don’t enter a meeting with their 
employees thinking about what they’re going to smell, 
but that’s exactly what you should do. By tuning into 
your sense of smell, you may discover alcohol, illegal 
substances, mold, fumes, and even extreme perfumes, 
all of which could be tip-offs in terms of employee 
performance.
 
✓ Touch: Carefully consider what your sense of touch is 
telling you when you meet with your employees. For 
example, when you pick up a piece of your employees’ 
work, ask yourself if it’s heavier or lighter than it should 
be. If your employee was supposed to provide you with a 
brief report but he delivers one that immediately feels as 
heavy as a phonebook, that may raise some questions 
about his performance, regardless of the contents.
 
✓ Sight: The next time you meet with your employees in 
their work areas, take a careful look around. Look at 
their desks, the photos on the walls, the piles on the 
credenzas, the in-baskets, the junk on the floors, or 
the half-open drawers. Most managers walk into an 
employee’s office or workstation, have their meeting, 
and then leave. If you take the time to look around, you’ll 
actually be able to see into your employee.
 
✓ Taste: When it comes to evaluating employees, taste is 
more figurative than the other senses. For example, when 
you meet with some employees, the discussion may 
leave a bad taste in your mouth and give you a gut feeling 
that something is amiss. On the one hand, you can easily 
ignore these feelings and refocus on the task. But, by 
doing so, you may be overlooking information that you 
should be taking into consideration. If you’re getting a 
bad visceral reaction, acknowledge it and try to figure 
out what’s behind it.
In each of these ways, the real message is to try to draw all 
your senses into your interactions with your employees. By 
combining this data with the broad array of performance 
data, you’re more likely to generate deeper and more useful 
information and insights, followed by more accurate and 
effective performance evaluations.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
72
Focusing On the Entire Year
Focusing On the Entire Year
In order for your performance appraisals to be effective, you 
need to maintain regular communication, contact, and coach-
ing with your employees throughout the entire evaluation 
period (typically, one year). Your employees shouldn’t have 
any doubt about how they’re doing. If they run into perfor-
mance glitches, issues, or problems, they should feel confi-
dent that you’ll identify and address these situations quickly.
 
Think of it this way: You’re conducting mini-appraisals and 
feedback sessions all year.
Still, many managers base their annual performance evalua-
tions on selected chunks of time and individual incidents 
during the evaluation period, rather than on the entire period. 
When they do this, they end up short-circuiting the evaluation 
process — and their employees.
Managers offer many excuses for gathering limited data, but 
all are dubious at best:
 
✓ There’s not enough information. This claim typically 
means that the managers haven’t been wandering around 
or focusing on the myriad available sources of perfor-
mance information. And now, with evaluations around 
the corner, they don’t have any clear and specific 
examples of their employees’ performance.
 
 With limited data, their evaluations suffer from a lack of 
thoroughness, specificity, and meaningful examples. 
Employees typically react to this type of feedback with 
denial, defensiveness, and disappointment.
 
✓ There’s not enough time. This pronouncement comes 
from managers who may be aware of the various 
sources of performance data, but who lack a true 
sense of interest, involvement, and commitment to 
the evaluation process itself.
 
 These managers base their judgments on limited and 
arguably questionable performance data, and they tend 
to rely on general impressions. The employees’ reactions 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 73
Focusing On the Entire Year
to their appraisals will again be distress, but they’ll also 
feel a sense of frustration and humiliation in seeing the 
minimal amount of time and interest that their managers 
put into their appraisals.
 
✓ There’s enough information already. For these manag-
ers, the rationalization is that people don’t change 
very much, so it makes just as much sense to do a 
cut-and-paste and provide the employees with essentially 
the same evaluation as last year.
 
 This approach is thoroughly dissatisfying and upsetting 
to employees, especially those who sincerely tried to 
improve their performance, competencies, and results. 
More than likely, they won’t make that “mistake” again.
 
✓ The most recent behavior is most important. Instead 
of taking the time to look at an entire year’s worth of 
performance, these managers rely heavily on recent 
events, whether positive or negative. They then justify 
their stance by claiming that these events are more 
important than events from months long gone by.
 
 If you want your employees to do next to nothing for 
the first few months and then come to life in the final 
quarter of the year, this plan is perfect. It punishes the 
employees who give their all throughout the year. It also 
punishes employees who had a great year, only to hit 
even a minor stumbling block toward the end of the year.
 
✓ Only a few incidents really matter. Managers who 
rely on this excuse believe that there’s no need for a 
year’s worth of data because it only takes a few critical 
incidents to really understand employee performance.
 
 This belief is problematic for a couple reasons:
 
• The critical incident method (see Chapter 4) 
includes numerous incidents from throughout the 
year, not just a few.
 
• When a manager relies only on a few key incidents, 
there is no way to know how accurately these inci-
dents reflect the employees’ overall performance. 
With limited performance data, the evaluations can 
be unduly positive or negative, both of which will 
be unfair not only to the employees who are being 
evaluated but also to the rest of the department.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
74
Focusing On the Entire Year
 
✓ I already know these are strong employees. These are 
the conflict-avoidance managers, the ones who view 
the appraisal process as a time to praise rather than 
appraise. Their evaluations are filled with happy talk 
and language designed to build bonds of friendship and 
goodwill with their employees. They enter the process 
with the preconceived notion that their employees are 
terrific, and that’s how they appraise them, regardless of 
the facts.
 
 Providing employees with recognition and building a 
strong working relationship with them is important, but 
that’s not appraisal — that’s another activity altogether: 
team building.
 
✓ I already know these are weak employees. These 
managers use the performance appraisal process as an 
opportunity to strike back or put down their employees, 
regardless of the employees’ accomplishments or 
achievements during the year. The twisted idea behind 
this approach is that the employees need to be tougher, 
and those who can take this heat will stand out and stand 
up for themselves.
 
 This macho approach generates little more than annoy-
ance, frustration, and hostility from the employees. 
For those who have worked hard and met their goals, 
this type of feedback tells them that their efforts and 
accomplishments during the year were meaningless.
 
Regardless of explanations or rationalizations, appraisals that 
fail to look at the full range of employee performance and 
competencies throughout the entire year are destined to fail.
There are four additional advantages associated with perfor-
mance evaluations that cover a full year:
 
✓ They put the employees on a level playing field. It isn’t 
fair to have employees in one department evaluated on a 
few samples of performance during the past month, while 
other employees are being scrutinized for an entire year.
 
✓ They’re accurate. When evaluations are based on perfor-
mance data gathered over the evaluation period, the 
employees’ ratings are not excessively downgraded 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 75
Accessing the Information
because of a couple of mistakes they made. When evalua-
tions cover only a few critical incidents or a few weeks, 
any number of invalid and unwarranted conclusions can 
be drawn.
 
✓ They’re motivational. If employees see that all of their 
behaviors throughout the year will be considered as part 
of their performance evaluation, they’re more likely to be 
motivated to maintain high standards and output 
throughout the year.
 
✓ They lead to better documentation. If a need arises to 
look back at an employee’s performance, data that 
covers the entire evaluation period is very useful.
Accessing the Information
One of the main determinants of the effectiveness of your 
appraisals is the quantity and quality of performance-based 
information that you gather. This information provides the 
foundation and support for the evaluations you create as well 
as for the feedback that you provide. If the information is thin 
or flimsy, the same will be said of your appraisals.
In any company, numerous resources can provide you with 
important performance-based data. Your notes on your 
employees’ performance are at the top of the list, but several 
resources beyond your notes provide additional insight into 
your employees’ performance — and give your evaluations 
additional impact.
Getting back to basics
Before looking at your notes or at any other resource related 
to performance appraisals, there are three basic preparatory 
steps you need to take.
Checking out job descriptions
Take a look at your employees’ job descriptions. You need 
to be sure that the criteria you’re using to evaluate your 
employees’ performance are actually part of their job today.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
76
Accessing the Information
As the year goes by, any number of formal responsibilities 
can slip by the wayside, while other roles, expectations, and 
standards can slip in and take their place. Sometimes this 
happens so subtly that neither you nor the employees notice 
it, but by the end of the year, their jobs can only bear a slight 
resemblance to what they were when the year began.
 
When you find that a job has changed but the job description 
has not, you need to make a decision: Either update the job 
description or update the employees and let them know that 
they need to refocus their energies and efforts back onto the 
central responsibilities that were originally assigned to them.
Reviewing last year’s appraisal
Assuming that your employees worked for you last year or 
worked for another manager in your company last year, 
another important early step is to take a look at last year’s 
evaluation. Presumably, that evaluation contained areas 
in which the employees needed to demonstrate some 
improvement. Identify those areas, as well as possible sources 
of such deficiencies, and keep them in mind as you conduct 
this year’s evaluation.
For example, if a particular performance issue is interfering 
with an employee’s effectiveness, it would be very helpful 
to know whether this is a new development or whether it’s a 
problem that was apparent last year. If this is a new develop-
ment, you can address it in the performance evaluation and 
offer some strategies to correct it.
At the same time, if this problem was addressed in the 
employee’s evaluation last year, then you’re dealing with two 
issues:
 
✓ There is a performance problem with this employee that 
needs attention and a plan of correction.
 
✓ This employee failed to take adequate action regarding 
an issue that was identified in last year’s evaluation.
Revisiting the objectives
The final step is to go back to last year’s evaluation and look 
at the specific objectives that you established with your 
employees for the current evaluation period. At this point in 
the process, you aren’t evaluating their performance. Instead, 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 77
Accessing the Information
your goal is strictly to familiarize yourself with the objectives 
and the priorities that were attached to them.
Reviewing your notes
When you regularly spend time on the floors with your 
employees, you’re in the perfect position to observe their 
work and provide them with the coaching, feedback, 
guidance, and support that they need to do their jobs well. 
Your face time with them also allows you to gather data 
regarding all aspects of their performance.
Your notes don’t need to be a detailed treatise. They can 
be a list that includes the dates, a few words describing 
the incidents, and a few more words describing their impact. 
When the time for the annual evaluation arrives, these 
notes will provide you with accurate firsthand information 
regarding your employees’ performance during the entire 
course of the evaluation period.
 
If you rely on your memory for all this information, you 
probably won’t remember exactly what happened, when it 
happened, and who did what to whom, especially over the 
course of a year.
 
When you go back over the log that you’ve kept on your 
employees’ performance over the year, you’ll find several 
areas that are rich sources of data for their evaluations:
 
✓ Getting the job done: Upon initial review, your notes are 
going to provide you with the factual information you 
need in order to determine whether your employees 
actually carried out all their job responsibilities.
 
 The idea at this point is not so much to evaluate data 
as it is to gather it. Depending upon the job position, 
this is where you generate specific and measurable 
performance-related totals (such as sales calls made, 
number of designs completed, number of programs 
accepted or rejected, amount of errors, number of 
returns, number of projects completed on time, training 
programs attended, and the like). You can feed this 
information back to your employees, and it establishes a 
credible framework for the evaluative feedback that 
you’ll also be providing.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
78
Accessing the Information
 
✓ Meeting objectives: Your notes will tell you whether 
your employees met the agreed-upon objectives. Because 
you’ve already reviewed the objectives, you’re also able 
to make an accurate judgment regarding the value of 
meeting one objective versus the value of meeting 
another.
 
✓ Performing up to par: Your notes will also show you 
how your employees handled the full spectrum of inci-
dents that they encountered, all the way from carrying 
out the most important functions of their position down 
to their handling of the most basic chores. You can find 
clear and specific examples of your employees’ key 
behaviors, actions, and interactions, and importantly, 
the results that your employees achieved in these myriad 
situations. You’ll have clear documentation on how the 
employees handled each incident, as well as how each 
situation ended up.
 
✓ Applying competencies: Your notes will provide you with 
valuable insight into the full range of your employees’ 
competencies in such areas as communication, technical 
knowledge, dealings with others, managing time, and so 
on. Although observing your employees’ skills in these 
areas is important, it’s even more critical for you to see 
how effectively your employees are able to apply these 
skills to their work. Your on-site observations will also 
provide you with firsthand data on your employees’ 
commitment to upgrading their competencies, as well as 
their ability to impart their knowledge to others.
Reviewing the files
As part of the process of accessing and gathering a full range 
of information about your employees’ performance during the 
year, take a look at each employee’s file. The file can contain 
important pieces of performance-related data that can 
enhance as well as round out the information you’ve already 
assembled.
 
If other managers have work-related contact and dealings with 
your employees, you can gather additional information for the 
evaluations by discussing your employees’ performance with 
them. Don’t forget to ask your own manager.

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 79
Accessing the Information
Considering complaints
During the course of the year, complaints about an employee 
can be documented. The complaints could have come from 
other managers or employees, or possibly from customers or 
vendors.
If the complaints were focused on incidents that occurred 
early in the year, you may not be aware of them at evaluation 
time, unless you specifically check the employee’s file.
Regardless of whether these complaints impact the 
employee’s ratings, you need to be aware of them, review 
them, and calibrate the role you believe they should play 
in the employee’s appraisal.
Considering compliments
As you look through your employees’ files, you may also find 
letters, e-mails, and other documentation praising your 
employees. Compliments can come from people at any level 
within the company, as well as from outsiders who have 
contact with your employees. Depending upon the sources 
and incidents behind this praise, you may also want to 
consider this data in preparing your evaluation.
 
Be sure to mention these compliments when you’re conduct-
ing evaluation sessions. They’ll motivate your employees to 
keep up the good work!
Reviewing reprimands
Your review of the files may also turn up some reprimands. 
You may have entered these reprimands in your notes, but 
they may have slid under the radar, which is why checking 
the employee files is so important.
When you find reprimands, consider the number of incidents, 
their severity, and any actions taken as a result, whether by 
the employee or the company. If the problematic behaviors 
are continuing, make a note of that.
Homing in on honors and awards
Companies provide awards for all sorts of behaviors, such 
as for volunteering, coming up with suggestions for safety or 
sustainability, or referring friends to come to work for the 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
80
Accessing the Information
company. In addition, you may find honors that have been 
bestowed on your employees from outside organizations. If 
your employees have received awards of any kind, consider 
them as you compile the evaluations.
 
In some cases, honors and awards can be just enough to tip a 
given employee’s evaluation into a higher range.
Mulling over milestones
Documentation associated with employees’ efforts to con-
tinue their education and self-development is often found in 
their files. Look for information regarding classes, seminars, 
continuing education credits, certifications, degrees, and 
designations that your employees have pursued and achieved 
during the year.
In many cases, these milestones are met off-site, and, as 
a result, they may not appear in your notes. These accom-
plishments clearly fall in the area of competencies, and 
they’re worth considering as part of the appraisal process. 
After all, by enhancing their knowledge and skills, your 
employees bring additional value to their jobs and to the 
company at large.
Reviewing the evaluations
If your company’s appraisal process includes self-evaluations, 
or if you’ve opted to include them in the process, this is 
the time to look them over. The same applies to 360-degree 
feedback (see Chapter 3), if your company uses it.
Evaluating self-evaluations
When reviewing your employees’ self-evaluations, the first 
step is to take a look at how your employees approached 
this assignment. Employees who are careful, thorough, 
and detailed in their approach to work will demonstrate these 
characteristics in the way that they complete their self-
evaluations. At the same time, employees who are lackadaisi-
cal or careless will reflect these attitudes in this assignment.
After you’ve looked over the appearance of the forms, it’s 
time to look at the content. Look carefully at the employee’s 
ratings and try to get an overall sense of how she sees her 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 81
Accessing the Information
own performance. If the employee’s ratings are in sync with 
the data that you’ve generated, you can make three strong 
suppositions:
 
✓ Your employee has a realistic view of how she’s been 
performing.
 
✓ You’ve been providing the employee with effective feed-
back during the course of the year.
 
✓ The employee is being honest in completing her 
self-evaluation.
As a result of these suppositions, you shouldn’t have any 
trouble discussing your ratings during the evaluation 
sessions.
If you find that an employee’s self-ratings are totally different 
from what his performance data indicates, a couple things 
could be going on:
 
✓ Either your employee is living in dreamland, or you 
haven’t been adequately monitoring his performance and 
providing feedback.
 
✓ If you have overwhelming performance data to substanti-
ate your views of the employee’s performance, and 
you’ve been actively managing by wandering around, 
then the employee is naïve, lying, manipulative, or unin-
volved and uninterested in the evaluation process.
As a result of these two possibilities, you may face some 
difficulties when you and your employee sit down to discuss 
the performance appraisals. Make sure you’re thoroughly pre-
pared with clear, accurate, and specific performance data.
Evaluating 360-degree feedback
Companies use 360-degree feedback for different purposes. 
Some use it for employee appraisal, some use it for employee 
development, and some use it for both. (See Chapter 3 for 
more on 360-degree feedback.)
If your company includes 360-degree feedback in the appraisal 
process, this is the time to review the findings. This data — 
gathered from an array of anonymous individuals, such as 
co-workers, managers, peers, customers, and others — can 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
82
Completing the Evaluation Form
provide a good deal of additional insight regarding your 
employees’ performance competencies and effectiveness.
If you’ve been provided with an overview of the 360-degree 
feedback findings, you should find significant overlap between 
this feedback and the data you’ve generated on your own. If 
there are major differences, stay with your assessments, 
because your data focuses more directly on your employees’ 
specific job responsibilities and goal attainment.
 
360-degree feedback can help you further understand your 
employees and assess their performance, but this information 
should not be a substitute for your own appraisals, nor 
should it trump your own judgment.
 
Regardless of its role in the appraisal process, if your com-
pany uses 360-degree feedback, it’s most helpful to bring the 
feedback into play when you’re establishing a development 
plan with your employees.
Completing the Evaluation Form
After you’ve reviewed all the performance data from the 
various sources and resources that you were able to access, 
the next step is to complete the evaluation form. These 
forms vary from one company to another, but there are some 
overarching principles that can help you handle this step 
more easily and effectively:
 
✓ Start with your best employees. As a result of your 
direct observations and analysis of the performance 
data, you’re probably able to name the better employees 
in your department. These employees should be the first 
ones that you evaluate.
 
 By starting your evaluations with these individuals, you 
can clearly define, for yourself, the actual meaning of 
excellent performance. With this standard in place, you’ll 
be able to interpret and evaluate the performance of the 
rest of your team more easily.
 
✓ Write first, rate later. Because many companies have 
evaluation forms that combine written comments with 
numerical ratings for each component that’s being 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 83
Completing the Evaluation Form
evaluated, it can be difficult to know which to do first — 
ratings or written comments.
 
 The best approach is to go to a given item, write out your 
written comments, and then enter a numerical rating.
 
 When you write the numerical rating first, you may find 
yourself adjusting your writing in order to match those 
numbers. For example, if you think an employee is 
average and you immediately enter an average numerical 
rating, your writing will tend to confirm this rating. At the 
same time, when you do your writing first, you aren’t 
consciously or unconsciously influenced to color your 
comments to fit your predetermined numerical rating.
 
 Many performance appraisal forms that call for written 
comments also provide information on the kinds of 
factors to consider in your write-up. Be sure to look over 
these tips very carefully before starting your written 
comments.
 
✓ Think while writing. By writing out the assessments of 
your employees’ performance in a particular category, 
you’re forced to think specifically about their actions, 
their objectives, their competencies, and the outcomes 
of their efforts.
 
 Whether you’re writing a positive or negative comment, 
be sure that it’s laced with examples and supported by 
times and dates as you deem necessary. As you create 
and review your written comments, adding appropriate 
descriptive phrases as needed, you’ll be generating a 
clearer picture of your employees’ performance and the 
rating that it merits.
 
✓ Consider how it will be read. Don’t forget that whatever 
you write in the appraisals is going to be read by your 
employees. If your comments are vague, unsubstantiated, 
or focus on personality over performance, you’re setting 
the stage for problematic sessions with your employees.
Selecting a rating
After you enter your comments for each factor that you’re 
appraising, you’re ready to enter a numerical rating (assuming 
your form calls for one). The key to success with this step is 
to fully familiarize yourself with the rating scale.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
84
Completing the Evaluation Form
With many numerical rating scales, there is a mini-description 
associated with each number. For example, the rating form 
may list several behaviors associated with communication, 
accompanied by a rating scale that reads:
5 — Exceptional: Consistently exceeds expectations.
4 — Excellent: Frequently exceeds expectations.
3 — Fully competent: Meets expectations.
2 — Marginal: Occasionally fails to meet expectations.
1 —  Unsatisfactory: Consistently fails to meet 
expectations.
Without the mini-description following each rating, it would 
be easy for each manager to have a different opinion on 
what outstanding means. The descriptions result in far greater 
consistency in the process.
 
One of the major concerns in the performance appraisal pro-
cess is called inter-rater reliability. Essentially, this is the 
extent to which the 5 that you rate an employee is equivalent 
to the 5 that other managers rate their employees. With 
increased clarity in the evaluation forms, such as including 
mini-descriptions for each rating, the chances of increased 
inter-rater reliability improve. This reliability can be improved 
even further through training, practice evaluations, and 
additional information in the evaluation forms themselves.
At the same time, it’s at least as important for a manager to 
maintain a high degree of internal consistency when rating 
employees — in other words, all the employees who merit 
the same rating from you in a particular category should be 
essentially performing at the same level. Even if a 4 from 
you is closer to a 3 from most other managers, the internal 
consistency of your ratings will allow your scores to be better 
understood if one of your employees is being considered for a 
transfer, a promotion, or even a layoff.
Describing strengths 
and weaknesses
With all your numerical ratings and written comments in 
place, some forms will pose additional questions, the most 

 Chapter 5: Gathering and Analyzing the Data 85
Determining an Overall Rating
common of which focus on the employees’ strengths and 
areas for improvement.
Strengths
When writing about your employees’ strengths, your com-
ments will be most effective if they focus on specific behav-
iors and competencies. For example, although it’s nice for 
employees to hear that they “do excellent work,” the focus is 
totally unclear and the employees can’t anchor your comment 
to any particular action. So, although your employees would 
like to receive positive feedback in the future for their excel-
lent work, they don’t know which behaviors to repeat.
 
Your comments will take on more meaning, have a greater 
motivational impact, and have a longer shelf life if you 
phrase them in behavioral terms. For example, instead of 
saying that your employees do excellent work, give them 
specific examples of such work, such as “Provides extremely 
high-quality work on time.” With this type of comment, your 
employees clearly know the two components that generated 
this positive feedback — quality and timeliness.
Weaknesses
When writing about your employees’ weaknesses, the same 
basic framework applies. You need to be specific and avoid 
phrases such as “attitude could use improvement.” Your com-
ments will be more effective and more motivational if 
you leave out the word attitude and focus specifically on 
behaviors that are indicative of a questionable attitude, such 
as complaining, arguing, or refusing to help others.
 
After the review, part of your job will be to work with the 
employees to help them become more effective in the areas 
currently needing improvement. The more specific you are 
in your description, the better able you’ll be to focus your 
developmental efforts. And because your employees under-
stand the specifics of the areas needing improvement, they’re 
likely to be more receptive to your guidance.
Determining an Overall Rating
As you work your way through the performance appraisal 
form, you’ll start to get a sense of the overall rating of each of 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
86
Determining an Overall Rating
your employees. In some evaluation forms, the final rating is 
based on little more than this overall perception. In this case, 
you’re asked to give your own overall rating of the employee 
based on all the comments and rankings that you’ve entered 
into the form. The best guideline in this case is to make sure 
that the overall rating you provide is consistent with the 
individual ratings that you’ve provided in each category.
The only time to stray from this strategy is if your employee 
has done extremely well or poorly in parts of the job that are 
truly the most important elements of the job itself.
 
If you have full latitude in determining the final rating, you can 
add weightings to various areas that you evaluated in order to 
make sure that performance in those areas has a greater 
impact on the employee’s final rating.
At the other end of the continuum, some performance evalua-
tion forms include mathematical calculations and weightings 
for each of the ratings that you enter. In some cases, these 
forms are designed to take the ratings that you provide for 
each component, calculate an average score, and convert that 
into the overall rating.
 
When you’ve finished writing the appraisals and made your 
final evaluations, set them aside for a few days. This will 
give you some time to think about them and let any of your 
concerns incubate. When you revisit these evaluations, 
you’ll do so with a fresh perspective. Give each evaluation 
a final look, make any needed adjustments, and then lock 
them in as final. You’re guaranteed to be more certain about 
your ratings, and more comfortable with them, after this 
second visit.

B
y the time you’ve completed your employees’ evalua-
tions, the scheduled dates for your one-on-one sessions 
loom large on your calendar. Some managers feel uneasy at 
this point. But I have good news for you: If you’ve worked 
through Chapter 5, you’ve already taken three major steps to 
quell such feelings:
 
✓ You’ve gathered and documented accurate and specific 
performance data for each of your employees.
 
✓ In order to gather such data, you spent a lot of time in 
direct contact with your employees, providing them 
with feedback, coaching, guidance, and support. In 
doing so, you’ve provided them with a clear under-
standing of your thoughts regarding their performance, 
so you’ve eliminated the element of surprise from the 
forthcoming session. And this means that the likelihood 
of resistance, defensiveness, or disagreement is dramati-
cally reduced.
 
✓ You’ve written performance evaluations that are thor-
ough, fair, and focused on specific and measurable 
behaviors, competencies, and results, rather than on 
personalities.

In order to have highly productive appraisal sessions with 
your employees, all you need to do at this point is prepare 
and plan for each face-to-face discussion and then make sure 
that you stick to your plan and run each session in an orga-
nized, businesslike, and positive style.
Setting the Stage for 
the Appraisal
A few days before the sit-down sessions, you can take several 
key steps that will greatly increase their effectiveness and 
improve their chances of succeeding.
Identifying your objectives
Your employees won’t remember everything you say during 
their appraisal sessions. Because of the amount of informa-
tion and the nature of the feedback that you’re providing, 
employees often get overloaded and zone out a bit.
Plus, if an appraisal contains some negative feedback, or it’s 
a positive appraisal but still lower than what your employee 
expected or wanted, she’s likely to focus on this discrepancy 
and fail to absorb all your other important comments and 
points.
 
Regardless of the nature of the feedback that you’ll be provid-
ing, take the time to note two or three major points that you 
definitely want your employees to hear and remember. For 
example, these points may focus on specific competencies 
that your employees need to upgrade, various behaviors that 
are interfering with individual or departmental performance, 
or opportunities for growth and development.
By identifying these major points before the sessions, and 
then emphasizing and reemphasizing them during the 
sessions, you’ll greatly increase the likelihood that your 
employees will leave with a clear understanding of the most 
important components of your feedback.
Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
88
Setting the Stage for the Appraisal

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 89
Setting the Stage for the Appraisal
Setting an agenda
You don’t need an iron-clad agenda for appraisal meetings 
because the dynamics of these sessions can draw the discus-
sions into unplanned topics — and that’s not necessarily a 
bad thing. After all, such topics can include unanticipated 
suggestions, complaints, and concerns that can help identify 
existing problems or prevent new ones.
However, when the discussion strays from what you had 
intended, you need to be able to eventually guide the dis-
cussion back to the main points that you need to cover. An 
agenda can help you keep your discussions on target.
Your agenda should include
 
✓ The highlights of your opening remarks
 
✓ The step-by-step sequence of the performance-related 
feedback that you’re planning to provide
 
✓ A list of the key points that you want your employees to 
remember
 
✓ The point in the session where you plan to discuss the 
employee’s raise (or lack thereof)
 
✓ The key points you want to make when closing the 
session
 
In developing your agenda, jot down some estimates on the 
amount of time that you’re planning on spending on each 
item. Granted, some areas may take longer than you plan, 
but having a sense of timing will help you keep each session 
focused on the higher-priority topics and issues.
Scripting your delicate comments
When you have to provide negative feedback to an employee, 
knowing exactly what to say can be difficult. If you fumble for 
words and then hedge around a problematic issue or behav-
ior, your employee will sense your apprehension and confu-
sion and either shrug off your comments or seize the opening 
and challenge you.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
90
Setting the Stage for the Appraisal
One of the best ways to prevent this problem is to look care-
fully at the areas in which you’re going to give some negative 
feedback and then write down exactly what you want to say. 
You don’t have to give a lengthy diatribe — a well-crafted sen-
tence or two can say it all.
 
Don’t rush this scripting process. You may need to spend 
quite a bit of time, writing several drafts, to come up with the 
right handful of words, but they’ll be valuable to you during 
the session. After you’ve scripted your comments, be sure 
to practice them aloud several times until you can say them 
easily and naturally.
Bringing the data
Before the evaluation session, decide which pieces of docu-
mentation you’re going to bring. You don’t need every piece 
of data that you touched in determining the ratings, but you 
should have some data at your side:
 
✓ Evaluation forms: Be sure to bring two hard copies of 
the completed evaluations. If your employee completed a 
self-evaluation, bring two copies of that as well.
 
✓ The employee’s file: You aren’t likely to need to thumb 
through the employee’s file during the evaluation ses-
sion, but if you do need to access some primary support 
data, having the files nearby is helpful.
 
✓ Your notes: If your employee raises questions about 
specific times and dates regarding the issues that you’re 
discussing, having your log or notes nearby is helpful.
Setting positive expectations
Your expectations play a key role in many aspects of effective 
management (see Chapter 4), and they come into play again 
at this point in the performance appraisal process.
One of the most effective ways to increase the likelihood of a 
positive, open, and highly productive two-way conversation 
during an appraisal session is for you to set positive expecta-
tions. Visualize how you want each session to go — you’ll 
have an easier time achieving your goals if you’ve visualized 
them.

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 91
Handling the Logistics
Handling the Logistics
Several premeeting administrative steps play an important 
supporting role in determining the success of your sessions 
with your employees.
Scheduling the time
As part of the back-timing process, you most likely scheduled 
the discussion sessions with your employees several weeks in 
advance. At that time, your calendars and theirs probably had 
a fair share of wide-open spaces, but that’s likely not the case 
anymore — now your schedules are jam-packed, and you need 
to make sure you’ve allotted enough time for each meeting.
Clearing the deck
Always place scheduled appraisal sessions at the top of your 
priority list. Remove all other projects, meetings, and tasks 
from your calendar during the hours that are scheduled for 
these sessions.
If other assignments come your way, or if other people want 
to meet with you during these scheduled times, do everything 
you can to defer or delay them until you’ve completed the 
sessions.
 
Clearing the deck also means clearing your desk. Remove, file, 
or cover all documents on your desk while you’re conducting 
these sessions. If these documents are visible during the eval-
uation session, they can distract you and your employees — 
plus, they may reveal confidential information.
Blocking extra time
In most cases, you should schedule appraisal sessions to last 
an hour. Just to be safe, though, don’t schedule any other 
appointments that end right before the evaluation sessions 
or start right after them. Leave yourself at least a 30-minute 
cushion both before and after every evaluation.
 
Dashing into an evaluation session after the scheduled starting 
time sends a message of disinterest and carelessness to the 
employee, and it’s sure to raise his anxiety, distress, and ire.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
92
Handling the Logistics
Recognizing the role of reminders
When the times and dates for the sessions are around the 
corner, send e-mail confirmations to your employees. Make 
sure the confirmation e-mails are clear and direct, not wishy-
washy. Don’t ask an employee whether the date and time still 
works for her — remind her of the date and time you agreed on.
 
Unless a real crisis, crunch, or emergency occurs, avoid 
rescheduling these meetings. Each time an appraisal meeting 
is deferred, its role, impact, and significance decrease in the 
employee’s eyes.
Giving out the appraisals
One of the most important decisions to make prior to the eval-
uation sessions is when to give the completed evaluations to 
your employees. You can opt to give them their formal evalua-
tion forms at one of three different points.
When the session starts
Some managers start evaluation sessions by handing the com-
pleted evaluation forms to their employees. On the one hand, 
this approach reduces any mystery and doubt over the points 
to be covered in the sessions. The employees have an imme-
diate idea of the focus and even the tenor of the discussion.
On the other hand, when managers hand employees completed 
forms at the beginning of the sessions, the employees tend to 
rush through the forms and typically have trouble absorbing all 
the detail. Feedback of any kind arouses emotions, and these 
heightened emotions further interfere with the employees’ 
abilities to concentrate on what they’re reading. Plus, most 
employees aren’t comfortable sitting and reading their evalua-
tions while their managers are staring at them.
When the session ends
At the other end of the spectrum, some managers discuss the 
entire evaluation with their employees, and then give out the 
evaluation forms at the end. Although this approach elimi-
nates the speed-reading and concentration issues associated 
with handing out the forms at the outset, it has its own prob-
lems: When managers go point-by-point through evaluations 

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 93
Handling the Logistics
that the employees haven’t seen yet, employees typically hear 
the first few words of their managers’ comments regarding 
performance in a particular area and then start to wonder 
how they’ll be appraised on the next item.
Before the session
Many managers find that the best time to give the completed 
forms to their employees is before the sit-down sessions. 
Some managers give out the forms an hour or two ahead, 
while others give them out a day or two in advance.
Either way, the idea is to give employees a chance to under-
stand their evaluations and remove any initial knee-jerk reac-
tions. This approach gives the employees time to think more 
about their performance, formulate productive questions, 
and consider their own ways to make improvements where 
needed.
 
When you give the evaluations to your employees ahead of the 
discussion sessions, your employees come to these sessions 
better prepared to have a productive two-way conversation.
Selecting the right venue
As the time for your sit-down sessions with your employees 
draws nearer, carefully consider where you’re going to hold 
the meetings. You can do a great deal of preparatory work 
and create the most perfect evaluations in the world, but if 
you hold the sit-down sessions in inappropriate locations, 
their effectiveness instantly evaporates.
 
One of the best places for your sit-down evaluation sessions 
with your employees is your office, as long as you have a 
private office. Only hold evaluations in your office if it’s not 
a cubicle or workstation but rather a traditional office with a 
door and four walls that extend from floor to ceiling.
 
Even if your employees have their own private offices, you 
should still conduct the evaluations in your own office. Your 
employees will sense that they have more power and control 
in their own offices, but this can make it easier for them to 
resist or reject your comments, input, and guidance.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
94
Handling the Logistics
If you don’t have a private office, try to reserve a conference 
room or an available private office if your company has any. 
The goal is to find a site where you can meet privately, confi-
dentially, and out of the earshot of anyone else.
 
If you don’t have a private office but your manager has one, 
ask her whether you can use it for your evaluations. Many 
managers will go along with this request, especially those who 
take the process seriously and expect their employees to do 
likewise. Your manager may also have some suggestions for 
other options or meeting areas in the company.
Keeping it private
The concept of privacy is central to an effective performance 
evaluation session. Without privacy, both parties in the session 
feel awkward, distracted, and unable to be totally honest. And if 
these sessions lack honesty, there’s no point in holding them.
In order for evaluations to be productive, you need to have 
privacy both during and after the appraisal session.
During the session
In order to have an open and honest exchange, you need to 
have absolute privacy during appraisal sessions. This means 
that there are no visitors, audiences, or eavesdroppers of any 
kind.
After the session
The information that you discuss in appraisal sessions is 
private and confidential. Don’t discuss the contents of these 
meetings with others unless necessary in the context of doing 
business (such as in terms of promotions, transfers to other 
departments, or staffing cutbacks).
You’re not the only one who needs to keep the contents of 
appraisal meetings private. Employees shouldn’t discuss their 
ratings or your comments with others — either to brag or 
complain. In fact, if you find out that employees have freely 
discussed their performance evaluations with their co-workers, 
you may want to note this as a critical incident in their next 
performance evaluations.

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 95
Holding the Meeting
 
Performance appraisals don’t contain state secrets, but as 
you wrap up your review sessions, give your employees a 
friendly reminder that you won’t be sharing what you’ve dis-
cussed and that you expect them to do the same.
Holding the Meeting
When the time for the evaluation sessions with your employ-
ees arrives, several strategies will help make these meetings 
more effective from start to finish. You’ve already put the 
foundation in place, and now you’re ready to build some solid 
review sessions.
Opening the discussion
Your opening comments will set the tone, tenor, and atmo-
sphere for the entire discussion. Maybe you scripted them 
earlier (see “Scripting your delicate comments,” earlier in this 
chapter), or maybe you’re winging it. Either way, your initial 
comments in each session should do the following:
 
1. Greet the employee.
 
 Start by making friendly and welcoming comments to 
break the ice. To help further relax your employee, 
you can even ask a question or two about some infor-
mal topics that interest both of you.
 
2. Set the framework.
 
 This is the “here’s what we’re going to do” section of 
your opening. The idea is to give your employee an 
understanding of the structure of the meeting, includ-
ing an overview of the topics and timing.
 
3. Ask for questions.
 
 If an employee asks questions that deal with your 
opening remarks or with matters that should be 
addressed on the spot, this is the time to answer 
them. However, if the questions pertain to matters 
that you plan on discussing later in the review, advise 
the employee of this fact and make a note to yourself 
so you don’t forget to cover these topics later.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
96
Holding the Meeting
Leading the discussion
There is no single path for you to follow in order to conduct 
highly successful evaluation sessions. At the same time, when 
you’re leading these discussions, ten steps will help make the 
meetings more interactive and productive:
 
1. Let your employee talk.
 
 If your employee has completed a self-appraisal, your 
first step is to indicate that you’d like to hear his 
thoughts. Although you already have a copy of the 
appraisal and you’ve looked it over prior to this ses-
sion, tell your employee that you’d like to know more, 
especially in terms of his performance and results that 
he believes are particularly important, as well as the 
way in which he arrived at his specific ratings.
 
 If you or your company doesn’t use self-evaluations, 
you can still encourage the employee’s input at this 
point in the session by asking a question such as 
“How have things on the job been going during the 
past year?”
 
 
Giving your employees the chance to discuss their 
actions, achievements, and competencies is rewarding 
to them because it further emphasizes your respect and 
trust, while also reinforcing your partnership with them.
 
2. Give an overview of the session.
 
 After you’ve heard your employee’s thoughts regard-
ing her performance, your next step is to give her a 
brief overview of overall topics that you’ll be covering 
in the session.
 
3. Focus on objectives.
 
 This part of the discussion focuses on the agreed-
upon objectives and the extent to which your 
employee met them.
 
4. Focus on performance results.
 
 The emphasis in this section is on the various addi-
tional performance-related outcomes that were the 
result of your employee’s actions and efforts, even if 
such outcomes were not directly attached to the over-
all objectives.

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 97
Holding the Meeting
 
5. Focus on critical incidents.
 
 Your comments in this area are focused on the way in 
which your employee handled particularly noteworthy 
situations, whether positively or negatively.
 
6. Focus on competencies.
 
 This is where you discuss instances in which your 
employee applied his skills effectively to the job, 
shared his knowledge with others, or took specific 
steps to further build his competencies.
 
7. Focus on points of agreement.
 
 Whether based on your employee’s self-evaluations or 
on her opening comments regarding her performance, 
your focus at this point in the session is on the areas 
in which your employee agrees with your ratings.
 
 
These points are typically the more positive ratings in 
your evaluation. Many of your comments at this point 
are focused on encouraging your employees to con-
tinue to engage in the behaviors that generated these 
positive outcomes and ratings.
 
8. Focus on points of disagreement.
 
 This is the time to discuss the areas in which you 
rated your employee lower than he rated himself, 
whether based on his self-evaluation or his opening 
comments. Your objective is to learn more about your 
employee’s rationale for giving himself ratings that are 
higher than yours and for him to understand the ratio-
nale behind the ratings that you gave.
 
 
This is not a negotiation session, and you should not 
revise your ratings based on your employee’s com-
ments. Even after you provide an explanation of the 
rationale behind your ratings, your employee may still 
disagree. However, that isn’t a major problem as long 
as he truly comprehends the reasons why his ratings 
were lower than what he expected or wanted.
 
9. Focus on the overall rating.
 
 At this point in the process, you and your employee 
have discussed all the key performance-related issues 
and concerns, and it’s now time to discuss the overall 
rating. Your comments should focus on the steps you 
took to determine this rating.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
98
Holding the Meeting
 
 
If part of this overall rating is based on additional 
weightings that you placed on any of the areas within 
the performance appraisal, make sure that your 
employee understands the rationale and methodology 
behind this adjustment.
 
10. Focus on raises.
 
 There is a good deal of debate among managers as 
well as management theorists as to where to place 
raises in the performance appraisal session. Some 
managers don’t even think that raises belong in the 
session at all. Here are your options:
 
• Bringing up raises in the beginning: This approach 
is premised on the belief that employees don’t 
pay much attention during appraisal sessions with 
raises at the end because they’re fixated on what 
their raises will be. Letting them know at the outset 
is supposed to put an end to their wondering and 
allow them to pay attention to the feedback you’re 
providing. However, if they expected a better raise, 
they may end up being consumed with their disap-
pointment and not hear what you’re saying anyway.
 
• Bringing up raises toward the end: Here, the idea 
is to provide employees with a clearer understand-
ing of the relationship between their performance 
and the raise they receive. After giving glowing 
reviews, you’re ideally able to provide a direct 
reward for the employees’ stellar behavior, demon-
strating the clear link between better performance 
and better rewards. The same principle applies in 
reverse, when you’re providing less of a reward (or 
no reward) for less-than-stellar performance. The 
primary concern with this approach is that employ-
ees won’t hear what you’re saying until you talk 
about raises.
 
• Eliminating raises from the discussion: The idea 
behind this approach is that raises don’t belong in 
the performance appraisal session at all. Instead, 
these sessions should focus exclusively and exten-
sively on the employees’ past performance, while 
issues such as raises and objectives should be dis-
cussed in separate sessions.

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 99
Holding the Meeting
 
 
Because there is no uniform agreement on this matter, 
be sure to have a clear understanding of the way 
in which your company’s raise process is linked to 
the performance appraisal process. If you’re given a 
choice, opt for separate sessions to discuss raises. 
Doing so will allow you to focus thoroughly and 
unequivocally on an employee’s performance during 
the appraisal session, while focusing equally thor-
oughly on raises in a later session. With this approach, 
your employees will have a clearer understanding of 
the most important factors in both of these key areas.
Separate sessions for 
separate purposes
Although some companies still include 
raises in performance reviews, many 
employers have separated the goal-
setting and development phases 
from the performance-review phase. 
One main reason for this separation 
is that employees who sit through 
reviews aren’t ready to immedi-
ately shift gears and start talk-
ing about objectives, growth, and 
development — and neither are their 
managers.
Plus, if the review has been less 
than glowing, employees are even 
less inclined to start thinking and 
talking about their objectives. 
They’re still licking their wounds 
from the evaluations and need some 
time and distance in order to process 
what they’ve heard before reopen-
ing their minds to goal setting and 
development.
Finally, the objectives of these 
meetings are entirely different. 
Performance appraisals look back-
ward and evaluate the employees’ 
past actions, competencies, and 
outcomes; employees leave these 
sessions with an understanding 
of the areas in which they did well 
and the areas in which they need to 
improve. Goal-setting and develop-
ment meetings are designed to look 
at the future and help employees set 
development plans and objectives to 
enhance their own growth and per-
formance on the job.
Remember: When holding meetings 
of any kind, the attendees must liter-
ally and figuratively be on the same 
page. That doesn’t happen easily or 
naturally when performance apprais-
als and employee development are 
bundled into one session.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
100
Holding the Meeting
 
In some companies, managers advise their employees of the 
dollar amount of the increase they’ll be given. In other compa-
nies, managers discuss only the percentage increase. In many 
companies, managers don’t provide any final information 
regarding raises; instead, all they’re allowed to do is recom-
mend raises to senior management. In this case, they tell the 
employees the raise amounts or percentages that they’re 
recommending and explain that they’ll provide the employees 
with the exact amount at a later date.
 
If your company includes goal setting as part of the perfor-
mance appraisal session, this would be the point in the evalu-
ation when you and your employees discuss specific objectives 
and action plans for the coming year. Shifting gears can be dif-
ficult for you and your employees, so I recommend that you 
try to set up a separate time with your employees to carry out 
this very important function. (See the nearby sidebar, “Sepa-
rate sessions for separate purposes,” for more information.)
Providing negative feedback
Many managers have lingering fears about giving negative 
feedback to their employees during their evaluation sessions. 
But the negative comments that you provide in these sessions 
will be less stressful for you because this won’t be the first 
time that you’ve made them to your employees. By wandering 
around and spending a good deal of time with your employees 
(see Chapter 8), you’ve already provided them with negative 
feedback when their performance merited it. They already 
know where they’re performing well and where they’re per-
forming poorly, and they could just as easily provide them-
selves with the same negative feedback that you provide in 
these sessions.
 
Nonetheless, three strategies can make this process even 
easier for you:
 
✓ Sit down. Obviously, performance appraisals are sit-
down activities, which is a plus because providing nega-
tive feedback to your employees is much easier when 
you’re both seated. Why? Because people are far less 
likely to get heated up when they’re sitting down.
 
 Also pay attention to where you’re seated. A desk that sepa-
rates you from your employees can be a psychological 

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 101
Holding the Meeting
as well as physical barrier. In order to send a message to 
your employees that you want to partner with them in 
the appraisal process, try either sitting next to them or 
pulling your chair around your desk and sitting face-to-
face with no barriers between the two of you. In either 
setup, you’ll be able to give negative feedback more easily, 
and they’ll be able to receive it more easily as well.
 
✓ Use I not you. When you’re providing negative feedback 
to your employees, one surefire way to generate a harsh 
reaction is to lace your comments with the word you. 
Frequent use of the word you sounds like a combination 
of accusation and scolding, and employees are likely to 
become increasingly defensive with each additional you.
 
 Try using the word I instead of you when possible. For 
example, instead of saying “You didn’t complete the proj-
ect on time,” try saying “I’m wondering why the project 
came in late.” In this way, you’ve centered the issue on 
yourself and the project, which opens the door for a con-
versation instead of a confrontation.
 
✓ Focus on behaviors. The essence of performance 
appraisal is focused on behavior — and that’s essential 
to keep in mind when providing negative feedback. The 
idea is for your employees to sense that you’re con-
cerned or upset with some aspect of their behavior but 
not with them as individuals.
 
 For example, if you asked an employee to give a particu-
lar report to certain employees, but she gave it to all 
the employees, you could say, “You made a mistake by 
giving this report to everyone,” but your employee will 
probably perceive this as a direct attack, and she’s likely 
to react in kind. With some minor tweaking of the word-
ing, you can rephrase and refocus the feedback so that 
it’s targeted on the behavior and perceived as less of an 
attack: “Giving this report to everyone was a mistake.”
Eliminating interruptions
By selecting appropriate venues for the appraisal sessions 
(see “Selecting the right venue,” earlier in this chapter), 
you’ve automatically reduced the likelihood of interruptions.
However, when it comes to these sessions, reducing the likeli-
hood of interruptions is not good enough. In order to gain the 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
102
Holding the Meeting
full measure of value from performance appraisal sessions 
with your employees, you have to eliminate interruptions, or 
at least bring them down to the absolute minimum.
Advising the team
Prior to the evaluation session, be sure to let others know 
that you are not to be disturbed while this meeting is in prog-
ress. This means no paging, no one knocking on the office 
door, and no one opening the door slightly just to peek in and 
see if you’re serious about not being interrupted.
Taking no phone calls
If you have a “do not disturb” function on your phone, set it 
for this meeting. If not, let all calls go to voicemail.
 
If you have a caller identification system, don’t look over 
every time your phone rings. Doing so is rude, inconsiderate, 
and a disruption.
 
Don’t forget to turn off your cellphone during the meeting. Let 
all calls to your cellphone go to voicemail. You shouldn’t be 
doing anything with your cellphone during this meeting — no 
texting, no e-mailing, and no talking.
Avoiding your computer
Don’t sit at your computer during this meeting. Managers who 
do so often can’t resist the temptation to look over every time 
a new e-mail arrives, and some can’t keep their hands off the 
keyboard.
Actively listening
As you lead appraisal sessions, your effectiveness will be 
enhanced if you display solid listening skills. By listening care-
fully to what your employees are saying, not only will you be 
able to learn more about their actions and their motivations 
for taking them, but you’ll also be better able to determine 
whether your employees fully understand the reasons behind 
the ratings that you provided.
 
Regardless of ratings, employees feel better about the evalua-
tion process if they truly sense that they’re being heard.

 Chapter 6: Running a Productive Appraisal Session 103
Holding the Meeting
As part of the open exchange of ideas that is at the heart of 
appraisal sessions, you can take some steps to strengthen 
your listening skills.
 
✓ Focus on what your employees are saying. Some of the 
best ways to do this are to restate, rephrase, and summa-
rize what they say — for example, you can say, “Let me 
make sure I understand,” and then put their comments 
in your own words. Anytime you aren’t sure what they 
mean, ask for clarification.
 
✓ Focus on what they’re not saying. Pay extra attention 
to their body language, such as their facial expressions, 
whether they’re slouched or sitting forward, whether 
their arms are crossed, and whether they maintain eye 
contact.
 
✓ Show your employees that you’re engaged in the dis-
cussion. Your body language and comments should show 
your employees that you’re interested in this dialogue 
with them. You can do this by sitting forward, nodding 
when appropriate, and adding occasional comments and 
interjections indicating that you’re involved and listening 
(such as, “I see” and even “Uh-huh”).
Wrapping up the discussion
If you’ve fully worked your way through the agenda that you 
created for a given session and you’re satisfied that the objec-
tives you established prior to the session have been met, it’s 
time to bring the session to a close. As you do so, follow these 
key steps:
 
1. Give your employees a recap of their performance, 
particularly their major areas of strength and suc-
cess, along with the one or two areas where the most 
improvement is needed.
 
2. Tell your employees that you’ll be meeting again 
soon to talk about objectives and plans for growth 
and development for the coming evaluation period.
 
 Ask the employees to do some thinking in these areas 
and to write a draft of their objectives and develop-
ment plan between now and that next meeting.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
104
Holding the Meeting
 
 If you can do so on the spot, set a specific date and 
time for that meeting. If you can’t finalize a date at this 
time, let your employees know that you’ll be setting a 
date to meet within two weeks.
 
3. If you did not discuss raises during the appraisal ses-
sions, let your employees know that you’ll soon be 
setting up a separate meeting to do so.
 
4. Ask your employees if they have any further ques-
tions or if there are any other matters that they want 
to discuss in this session.
 
5. Sign and date the evaluation forms and ask your 
employees to do likewise.
 
 Be sure to mention that they can add their own com-
ments to the form if they want.
 
6. Express your positive expectations as you bring the 
sessions to an end.
 
 Let your employees know that you have confidence 
in them and their ability to succeed in making the 
improvements that were discussed during the 
appraisal sessions.

A
s you work your way through the performance appraisal 
process with your employees, you need to be on the 
lookout for the tripping points that can undercut not only your 
effectiveness but the effectiveness of the appraisal process 
itself. Managers have myriad opportunities to make mistakes 
in the appraisal process, and sometimes just one slip-up can 
render the whole process useless.
Fortunately, these pitfalls aren’t hidden or camouflaged 
subtleties. They’re far more apparent than that — especially 
when you know what to look for.
In this chapter, I shine a spotlight on the range of mistakes 
that other managers often make in the evaluation process, so 
that you don’t make the same mistakes yourself.
Managing Your Misperceptions
One of the main errors that managers make in the perfor-
mance appraisal process is failing to see employees as they 
truly are. When this happens, managers typically place too 
much emphasis on matters of minimal importance and too 
little emphasis on the stuff that matters most.

Managers who misperceive the realities of their employees’ 
behaviors do so as a result of their own needs, biases, expec-
tations, prior experiences, and memories. And no matter what 
the source of these misperceptions may be, the result is the 
same: The managers’ thinking is distorted, and they end up 
with evaluations that are equally distorted.
Calibrating recent events
Whether your employees have recently done something 
great or something that grates, the most likely outcome is 
that these recent actions and outcomes play a greater role in 
appraisals than is actually warranted.
Say an employee has been doing a good job throughout the 
year, consistently meeting her objectives. It wouldn’t be sur-
prising to find that her performance appraisal is, fittingly, in 
the “good” range. But if she makes a mistake toward the end 
of the evaluation period, her appraisal is likely to suffer in a 
totally disproportionate way. In fact, even small recent mis-
takes can trump much greater successes from months ago.
Why? Because recent events are far fresher in your memory 
than are the distant events that happened early in the evalua-
tion period. With recent events, you can relive the exact feel-
ings of satisfaction or annoyance that you experienced just 
a few weeks ago — whether your employees leaped over the 
bar or tripped over it.
At the same time, as you think back to your employees’ suc-
cesses and failures earlier in the year, you can review the 
facts as spelled out in your notes or log, but the physical and 
emotional reactions are gone, which reduces their influence 
on your thinking today.
 
As you complete your appraisals, make sure you’re not plac-
ing undue emphasis on the good or bad things that happened 
in the past month or two — be sure to consider the events of 
the entire evaluation period.
 
As you’re making notes on your employees’ performance 
throughout the year, write down more than just the facts. 
Whether you’re truly excited by your employees’ performance 
or results or you’re supremely dissatisfied, try to capture 
some of your enthusiasm or disappointment in your notes as 
Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
106
Managing Your Misperceptions

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 107
Managing Your Misperceptions
well. This way, your notes will help you consider the entire 
year’s worth of events — not just the ones that happened in 
the last couple of months.
Overpowering bias 
and stereotypes
Another misperception that managers may have about their 
employees may have nothing to do with the employees at all: 
I’m talking about biases and stereotypes. Remember: Such 
notions can be favorable or unfavorable, but either way, 
they’re a clear source of inaccurate appraisals.
Biases and stereotypes are really about prejudice, which 
literally means “to prejudge.” Prejudging is particularly prob-
lematic in performance appraisals because one central mana-
gerial role in the process is to judge the employees’ behavior. 
If the judging component is completed before the process 
even starts, there’s no point in starting the process at all.
 
If the potential damage that bias and stereotyping heap on 
the performance appraisal process is not enough to convince 
you to dispel your prejudicial beliefs, something else just 
might grab your attention: a lawsuit. That’s right: If you allow 
factors such as race, religion, gender, national origin, sexual 
orientation, age, or disability to affect your appraisal of your 
employees, you and your company are likely to face a claim of 
discrimination.
Beating bias
Managerial bias is a strong preconceived leaning or inclina-
tion about a person or situation. Such bias can be positive or 
negative, and it can cause managers to look at their employ-
ees’ performance and see accomplishments where there are 
none and overlook failures where there are many.
 
One of the most compelling ways to conduct a bias test on 
yourself is to take a sample of one of your employee’s behav-
iors that you rated as “excellent” and ask yourself if all your 
other employees would have received the exact same ratings 
if they had performed at the exact same level. If you would’ve 
rated some of them lower, some bias has slipped into your 
thinking.

108
Managing Your Misperceptions
Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
 
The first step in eliminating bias is recognizing it.
Stopping the stereotypes
When it comes to stereotyping, managers take the supposed 
characteristics of a group and apply them to all its members. 
Although some stereotypes are positive, most are unflatter-
ing, unfair, and inappropriate. When stereotypes enter any 
phase of the performance appraisal process, the information 
is instantly tainted, and the credibility of the appraisal drops 
to zero.
 
A quick way to see whether stereotyping is entering your own 
thinking is to pick any particular group of people, whether 
based on political affiliation, nationality, weight, age, or any 
other factor. With that group in mind, ask yourself whether you 
believe that there are any personality traits that are typical of 
all its members. If you think such characteristics exist, you’re 
also finding the stereotypes that exist in your mind. Whether 
these stereotypes are positive or negative, they’re sure to 
interfere with your effectiveness in the appraisal process.
 
When you’re aware of the stereotypes you hold, you’ll have 
taken a gigantic step toward eradicating them.
Rethinking “just like me”
When managers sense that they have a lot in common with 
certain employees, they tend to be extra lenient when apprais-
ing the performance of these employees.
If a manager and an employee share common backgrounds 
and experiences, the manager is likely to feel significantly 
greater levels of trust, understanding, and familiarity with this 
employee — which leads to more positive evaluations. For 
example, say you grew up on a farm in the Midwest, worked 
your way through college, and married your high school sweet-
heart. You’re going to feel much closer to an employee who has 
a similar background than you will to an unmarried employee 
who grew up in a major city, partied through college, and spent 
his summers traveling around Europe. When it’s time for the 
performance evaluation, that common bond between you and 
that first employee will generate higher ratings.
By letting the bonds of commonality overpower the facts of 
performance, you’re overlooking three key and costly points:

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 109
Managing Your Misperceptions
 
✓ Although you may have an employee whose background 
is remarkably similar to yours, there is no reason to 
assume that her performance is going to be equally 
remarkable.
 
✓ Plenty of employees are just like you in many respects, 
but certainly not in every respect. And some of those dis-
similar respects just might be their competence, work 
ethic, loyalty, or honesty.
 
✓ If an employee senses that you’re somehow swayed by 
a commonality in your backgrounds, that employee may 
also sense that she has a wild card that will automati-
cally condone marginal work, self-serving behaviors, and 
flaunting of company policies and standards.
 
When a manager has a lot in common with an employee and 
that sense of commonality leaks into the performance evalua-
tions, the rest of the employees have a different term for this: 
They call it favoritism. And if you’re looking for an instant way 
to undercut teamwork, cooperation, loyalty, and productivity, 
favoritism is right at the top of the list.
Recognizing the halo effect
If you’re looking for one of the most common errors in the 
performance appraisal process, you’ll find it in the halo effect. 
The halo effect is the tendency to allow your employees’ 
excellent performance in one area to impact the way you 
evaluate their performance in all other areas.
When your employees have performed extremely well in one 
key part of the job, you need to provide them with a very posi-
tive rating in that area. But after you’ve assigned that rating, 
you need to approach the next item with a clean slate and no 
lingering positive predispositions from the last item.
The halo effect comes into play when managers don’t make 
a clean break from the rating on that previous item. Instead, 
their positive rating on one item leads to equally positive rat-
ings on every other item, regardless of actual performance.
For example, say you’re a real stickler for detail, and you 
just finished giving one of your employees an outstanding 
rating on his thoroughness, detail-mindedness, and accuracy.

Managing Your Misperceptions
However, instead of moving to the next factor and making 
a merit-based rating, the halo that you just placed on your 
employee gets in your way, leading you to conclude that 
because he performed with distinction in one important area, 
surely he’s deserving of equally high ratings in all other areas.
That one halo leads to halos in every category, and that leads 
to trouble. Here are some of the problems caused by the halo 
effect:
 
✓ When employees figure out which category is the 
key source of all the positive ratings, they focus their 
behavior only on that category. For example, if neatness 
and accuracy are the hot buttons that trigger a vast array 
of positive ratings, you’ll end up with employees who 
devote all their energy to this area. Of course, this means 
that they’re devoting less energy to other areas, such 
as productivity, communication, and quality of work, to 
name just a few.
 
✓ When employees are provided with positive ratings 
across the board, they know that many of those ratings 
were undeserved. Instead of feeling appreciative for 
such ratings, they’re more likely to view the process as 
meaningless. If they’re going to get a barrage of outstand-
ing ratings that have nothing to do with their perfor-
mance, sure, they’ll accept these ratings, but they won’t 
accept the notion that performance appraisal is a valu-
able process.
 
✓ A collection of equally positive ratings across the 
board actually sends a less flattering message about the 
manager’s attitude — namely, that the manager didn’t 
devote much time, energy, or effort to the appraisal 
process. Instead, the manager simply hooked onto one 
piece of performance and used it as the litmus test for 
ratings in all other categories. Employees generally 
believe that their managers’ lack of interest and concern 
in the appraisal process is indicative of a lack of interest 
and concern for them as individuals. Although recogni-
tion has been consistently found to be linked to motiva-
tion, that isn’t the case for recognition that’s perfunctory 
or undeserved. A string of undeserved positive ratings is 
more likely to be perceived as insulting, degrading, and 
even embarrassing.

Managing Your Misperceptions
Dismissing the horns effect
The halo effect (see the preceding section) has an evil twin 
known as the horns effect. With the horns effect, when employ-
ees perform poorly in one key performance area, managers 
give them lower ratings in all areas.
As you may expect, the horns effect generates even more 
negative reactions than the halo effect. At least with the halo 
effect, the employees received positive ratings. But with the 
widespread negative ratings associated with the horns effect, 
not only are the ratings inaccurate, but they can reduce possi-
bilities for employees to receive raises, promotions, and other 
pluses that accompany positive ratings.
The horns effect results in some significant problems:
 
✓ When employees know that they’ve at least been 
performing satisfactorily but they’re given uniformly 
low ratings, they see the entire evaluation process as 
unbalanced and unfair. When employees believe that a 
process that’s at the heart of their tenure, earnings, and 
career is somehow inequitable, their attitude toward 
their job, their manager, and their work takes a major hit. 
And their performance and productivity soon do likewise.
 
✓ If the employees can figure out which specific behavior 
contaminated their overall ratings, they’ll place undue 
emphasis in that area, while putting less emphasis in 
all other areas. This leads to further gaps in their perfor-
mance, productivity, and overall satisfaction.
 
✓ Most managers actively say they treat employees hon-
estly, fairly, and respectfully, but when they let the 
horns effect horn in on their evaluations, all these pro-
nouncements go down the drain — along with the man-
agers’ credibility. And when you lose credibility with 
your employees, your potential effectiveness across the 
board is severely compromised.
 
✓ When employees see that their evaluations are inex-
plicably and unacceptably low, they’re disappointed 
and angry — which comes out in full force in the one-
on-one sessions with their managers. The likelihood of 
having an open discussion about the employees’ perfor-
mance and development is impossible when the horns 
effect has tainted the ratings.

Managing Your Misperceptions
Getting beyond first impressions
The shelf-life of first impressions is remarkable. If you think 
back to the first time that you met the significant others in 
your work life or personal life, you can probably remember, 
and in many cases picture, that first encounter. Not only does 
the image of that first encounter stay with you, but so do 
many of the initial feelings that you had toward that person.
The problem is, when employees make a positive or negative 
first impression, it often stays with their managers and leads 
to an equally positive or negative impression of their work.
For example, think of an employee whose first weeks on the 
job were filled with questions. Every assignment or request 
was followed by a barrage of questions befitting an investiga-
tive reporter. He filled the air with questions about projects, 
calendars, meetings, dates, deadlines, styles, and standards. 
And in some cases, he asked the same question more than 
once or twice or three times.
After a month or two, he finally settled down, learned the lay 
of the land, and became a contributing member of the team. 
But that first impression is still there, lurking in the memory 
bank of everyone who worked with him in that early period. 
That first impression is the foundation upon which all other 
impressions are built.
Even as these early impressions are overshadowed by more 
recent events, they never totally disappear. And one of the 
times when they typically reveal themselves is during the per-
formance evaluation process. As managers mull over the data 
that they’ve gathered, some of that first-impression data can 
still leak into the evaluative process.
 
Instead of ignoring first impressions, try to remember them. 
By drawing them out, considering them carefully, placing 
them in the context where they belong, and acknowledging 
that your employees have come a long way since then, 
you’ll be far less likely to allow them to alter your thinking 
and ratings.

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 113
Managing Your Misperceptions
Countering the contrasts
As part of the performance evaluation process, managers are 
often tempted to compare employees with each other, instead 
of comparing them with the standards that have been estab-
lished for a given position. When this occurs, one employee 
may have done clearly excellent work, but his work isn’t as 
good as that of an amazing superstar in the department — 
which can lead to a lower rating for the first employee, who 
has clearly met all the established criteria for a far better rating.
Making this mistake is particularly easy when you’re prepar-
ing the evaluation forms. The contrast effect sneaks in when 
you’ve just evaluated an absolutely fantastic employee, and 
now it’s time to rate an employee who has performed well, 
but not quite as well as the previous employee.
A parallel outcome occurs when you complete the evalua-
tion of a marginal employee and then start to work on the 
evaluation of a very good employee. You’re likely to give that 
latter employee an even higher rating than merited, again just 
because of her fortuitous placement in the lineup.
Either way, employees feel cheated and angry.
 
One of the best ways to prevent the contrast effect from 
occurring is to take a break between appraisals, especially if 
you’ve just completed a great or marginal evaluation. You can 
stand up and stretch, take care of a quick chore, return a brief 
phone call, take a quick stroll to the break room and back, 
or go back and look at several of the evaluations that you’ve 
already completed.
By redirecting your thinking to other matters between evalu-
ations, you’re better able to clear your head and start each 
evaluation with an open mind.
Minding your emotions
Your emotions have a major impact on the way you see the 
world around you. When you’re upset, everything looks a 
little worse; when you’re content, everything looks a little 
better. You’re only human, which means your mood fluctu-
ates when you’re at work — for reasons related and unrelated 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
114
Managing Your Misperceptions
to your job. Maybe you just received some major recognition 
for the way you managed a particular project, or perhaps you 
just got some bad news about a family member.
Either way, your emotional state affects your thinking, atti-
tudes, and behavior, and that means it also impacts the way 
you conduct performance evaluations. This doesn’t mean that 
you must be in a particular emotional state in order to over-
see the process fairly. Instead, if you sense that you’re feeling 
particularly upbeat or downtrodden when you’re about to 
evaluate one of your employees, honestly accept this state 
of mind and remember that it can impact the appraisal that 
you’re completing.
 
Having accepted the fact that you’re in a particularly positive 
or negative state of mind, one way to calibrate the impact is 
to take out a couple of appraisals that you already completed 
and cover up the ratings that you provided on two or three 
items. Look over the performance categories and your written 
comments, and then decide what the rating should be. When 
you have them in mind, uncover the ratings that you provided 
and see how close you are to them now. If you came up with 
significantly higher or lower ratings than in the completed 
evaluations, keep that in mind as you continue the process 
with the upcoming evaluations.
Veering from the center
Another common mistake in the appraisal process is called 
the central tendency — a predisposition to rate all employees 
in the center of the rating scale, regardless of the fact that 
their actual performance merits higher or lower ratings.
Managers who employ this questionable strategy ignore yet 
another fact: namely, that this approach suffers from inaccu-
racy, inequity, and a total lack of substantiation.
Some managers contend that this approach treats all employ-
ees fairly by giving them essentially the same ratings, while 
also saving the managers time in carrying out the process. 
Both of these assumptions are highly problematic:
 
✓ All employees have not performed the same, and 
providing them all with equal ratings isn’t going to 
increase anyone’s sense of equity in the workplace. 

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 115
Managing Your Misperceptions
To the contrary, employees who believe they deserve 
better-than-average ratings are going to feel that they 
haven’t been given equitable treatment at all.
 
✓ Although it may indeed take you less time to complete 
an evaluation where all employees are provided with 
ratings in the middle of the scale, this approach is actu-
ally more time-consuming overall. Why? Because the 
one-on-one sessions with employees will be long, drawn 
out, and confrontational. And, after the sessions, you’ll 
need to spend more time dealing with performance prob-
lems generated by employees who are dissatisfied with 
inaccurate ratings and an apparent lack of concern, inter-
est, and support from you.
 
In many cases, the actual reasons behind this mistaken 
approach are a combination of questionable energy, lack of 
commitment to the performance appraisal process, lack of 
understanding of the process, and a desire to avoid going out 
on any kind of limb when evaluating employees.
 
If you notice that all your evaluations indicate that your 
employees are average through and through, go through the 
evaluations again.
Avoiding the skews
There are two common mistakes in the appraisal process that 
are strikingly similar to the central tendency, and these are 
called the positive skew and negative skew. Instead of rating 
all the employees in the middle of the scale, some managers 
rate all their employees on the positive end of the scale, while 
other managers rate all their employees negatively.
Going positively skewed
The positively skewed evaluations suffer from several ques-
tionable assumptions:
 
✓ They lead to fewer, if any, confrontations, disagree-
ments, and denials in the one-on-one sessions. Sure, 
the one-on-one sessions will be less stressful because 
employees won’t insist that their evaluations should be 
lower. Unfortunately, the feedback is useless.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
116
Managing Your Misperceptions
 
✓ Positive evaluations are easier and quicker to write. 
This too is correct — it’s always easier to write praise 
than it is to craft negative feedback. But again, there is no 
point in giving positive feedback for behaviors that are 
less than positive. In fact, such positive reinforcement 
can encourage employees to continue to engage in coun-
terproductive behaviors that should be avoided.
 
✓ By bestowing heaps of praise, thanks, and adulation 
upon employees, I’ll be well liked. This is a myth. 
The reality is that these managers are more likely to be 
viewed as needy, weak, and easily manipulated.
 
✓ Providing the employees with positive feedback will 
encourage them to work hard to continue to improve 
their performance. This is true, as long as the posi-
tive feedback is associated with positive performance. 
Providing positive feedback for all performance renders 
all the feedback meaningless. As noted earlier, it also 
rewards behaviors that should be punished.
 
 
If an employer ever needs to take disciplinary action 
because of the questionable performance of a given 
employee, it’ll be far more difficult to pursue if the 
employee’s performance evaluations are filled with posi-
tive ratings.
 
✓ Positive ratings for employees make managers look 
good in the eyes of their own managers (hence, making 
them more promotable). After all, if their department is 
filled with outstanding people, these managers can be 
promoted and one of the outstanding employees in their 
department can move into the open position.
 
 The problem is, when the actual performance levels of 
the employees become apparent — and sooner or later 
this does happen — everybody suffers. If these managers 
are promoted, they’re removed from their zone of com-
petence, while the employees left behind haven’t been 
adequately coached to handle their current responsibili-
ties, let alone increased responsibilities.
Going negatively skewed
An equally problematic set of errors occurs when managers 
give all their employees’ equally low ratings. And the motiva-
tions for this approach are equally questionable:

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 117
Doing Away with Discussion Stoppers
 
✓ For some managers, the idea behind the overly negative 
ratings is to identify the really tough and driven employ-
ees. The contention is that when employees are burdened 
with negative ratings, only the strong will survive.
 
 This type of macho reasoning doesn’t belong in the work-
place. Nothing about inequitable evaluations will engen-
der improved performance. When employees perform 
well and still receive wholly unwarranted negative evalu-
ations, they feel resentment, frustration, dissatisfaction, 
and distrust.
 
✓ These managers may also contend that there simply are 
no outstanding employees, regardless of the facts. For 
such managers, there is a sense of pride in believing that 
no one is capable of achieving the high standards that 
they’ve set for the department. Their stated objective is 
that their extremely high standards will push employees 
to work even harder.
 
 These managers may claim that their high standards will 
inspire employees to leap for that brass ring, but in truth, 
the managers won’t let anyone grasp it. On a deeper 
level, they may well believe that granting positive ratings 
to their employees somehow diminishes their own worth 
to the company. Besides, in order for goals to be motiva-
tional, they must be challenging yet attainable. If they’re 
totally out of reach, there is no reason to think of them as 
motivational.
 
The term attribution refers to the way in which people draw 
inferences about the causes of various events or behaviors. 
People make incorrect attributions quite frequently, and 
some can be found in the performance appraisal process. 
Frequently described as attribution errors or attribution bias, 
the most common example is the tendency of some managers 
to regard employees’ successes as the result of the efforts of 
the managers themselves, while regarding the source of the 
employees’ failures as being the employees themselves.
Doing Away with Discussion 
Stoppers
When you’re reviewing your employees’ performance during 
the face-to-face evaluation sessions, you may unwittingly do 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
118
Doing Away with Discussion Stoppers
something that brings an open discussion to a grinding halt. 
And when this happens, the remainder of the conversation is 
strained, uncomfortable, and incapable of reaping the benefits 
that performance appraisal offers.
Keeping the discussion stoppers in mind is the best way to 
stop them from interfering with your evaluation sessions.
Labeling
Managers can easily look at their employees’ behaviors 
and affix labels to the employees themselves. For example, 
employees who turn in their work late could be called “lazy,” 
employees who clown around could be called “immature,” 
and employees who don’t have positive working relationships 
with some of their peers could be called “nasty.”
The problem is, when you label an employee, the most 
common reactions are defensiveness, anger, vociferous 
denial, and harsh challenges. Employees typically feel insulted 
when they’re labeled, and most won’t just roll over and take it.
You’re even likely to see your employees respond with various 
physical reactions, such as sweating, tightness in the neck or 
jaw, and shallow breathing, all of which are common reactions 
to stressful situations. In fact, by using language that your 
employee will likely interpret as a verbal assault, you’re likely 
to see your employees demonstrate the most common reaction 
to stress: namely, fight or flight — neither of which is exactly at 
the top of the list for effective performance appraisals.
 
The best way to avoid this problem is to avoid labeling 
employees at any point in the evaluation process. Instead of 
focusing on a label, focus on the employees’ specific behav-
iors that caused you to come up with a label in the first place.
For example, if you believe that an employee is lazy, focus on 
specific documented instances in which his behaviors clearly 
demonstrated laziness. If projects were late, assignments 
were shabbily completed, or the employee was sleeping on 
the job, those points are the ones to discuss.
 
The best way to provide feedback is to focus on your employ-
ees’ behaviors and not on their traits, characteristics, or per-
sonalities. After all, there isn’t much your employees can do 

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 119
Doing Away with Discussion Stoppers
with a label other than deny it. But by providing specific per-
formance data instead of a catchall label, you’re setting the 
stage to work productively with your employees to implement 
a plan of correction. Plus, they’ll be much more receptive to 
doing so.
 
The weaknesses that people identify in others are often their 
own shortcomings. People are quick to see their own weak-
nesses in others because they’re so familiar with them in their 
own behavior. As part of the appraisal process, look for any 
common negative themes that you’re identifying among your 
employees. You may be highlighting your own weaknesses, 
rather than theirs.
Mentioning other employees
Another key mistake during the one-on-one performance eval-
uation sessions is to talk about your employees’ co-workers. 
Even if a given employee is part of the most amazing team in 
the company, this isn’t the time to be discussing the other 
players.
 
This session is the individual employee’s special time with 
you, and all the focus and emphasis should be on him, not on 
anyone else.
Some managers bring up the names of other employees 
because they believe that these colleagues can serve as role 
models and examples. For example, when employees have 
questions about what it takes to do an outstanding job in 
a particular performance area, some managers respond by 
suggesting that the employee take a look at a particular co-
worker. This type of response is replete with problems:
 
✓ The employee who is being evaluated doesn’t want to 
hear praise about some other employee — she wants 
specific insights from the manager regarding the best 
steps to take in order to generate measurable improve-
ments in performance and future ratings.
 
 
Some employees feel insulted that their manager would 
use their evaluation time as an opportunity to praise 
someone else.
 
✓ It is also possible that a manager has an inaccurate 
impression of a so-called excellent co-worker. Perhaps 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
120
Doing Away with Discussion Stoppers
the named co-worker is quite skilled at presenting a 
favorable image to the manager but not much more. 
Maybe there is less to this employee than meets the 
manager’s eye.
 
✓ If employees believe that there are certain favored 
employees in the department, this perception is likely to 
be further reinforced if a manager happens to mention 
these individuals during the evaluation.
 
✓ Mentioning other employees during an evaluation ses-
sion is likely to diminish teamwork and camaraderie 
within the department. Employees tend to leave this type 
of session believing that teamwork means very little and 
that they should take whatever steps they can to step 
over their co-workers and gain their managers’ attention 
and favor.
Getting defensive
During the course of the appraisal discussion, some employ-
ees may make condescending or degrading comments that 
attack you or the ratings you provided. It’s quite normal to 
react defensively when faced with such comments, but as 
a manager, you have to remain focused, businesslike, and 
professional.
If you sense that you’re getting upset, take a few deep breaths, 
let the employee vent, and refrain from instantly responding. 
When you do say something, use a calm and deliberative 
style.
 
Let the employee know that you’re actively listening by sum-
marizing, rephrasing, and asking questions. When doing so, be 
sure to ask rhetorical questions at the end of your statements, 
such as, “Isn’t it?” or “Don’t you think?” The idea is to gener-
ate several “yes” responses from your employees because this 
can help bring them into a more agreeable mindset.
 
If you become defensive in these sessions, the credibility 
of your ratings becomes highly suspect. And this can lead 
to more provocative questions and comments from your 
employees.

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 121
Creating Problems rather than Solutions
Arguing
Some managers make the mistake of getting into arguments 
with their employees during evaluation sessions. If you argue 
during these sessions, you’ll have automatically entered an 
argument that you can’t win.
If you ultimately prevail on every point, you still lose because 
your employee was able to drag you into unprofessional and 
unbusinesslike behavior. All your feedback to the employee 
from this point on will be overshadowed by this questionable 
behavior.
And if you somehow fail to prevail on every point in the argu-
ment, then you lose in two ways:
 
✓ You obviously lose the argument and the points that you 
were trying to emphasize.
 
✓ You lose because your employee was able to drag you 
into this verbal quagmire.
 
The best way to avoid an argument is by refusing to engage. 
If your employee tries to draw you in, tell her that you aren’t 
going to argue over any of this. At the same time, let the 
employee know that you want to answer all her questions. If 
the employee expresses concern over ratings in a particular 
area, calmly respond with facts, figures, dates, and examples.
Creating Problems rather 
than Solutions
Some managerial behaviors are specifically crafted to avoid 
problems in the appraisal process, but they end up having the 
exact opposite impact.
Bargaining
Some managers enter the appraisal sessions with the expecta-
tion that they may do some bargaining with the employees 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
122
Creating Problems rather than Solutions
before finalizing their ratings. These managers hope that their 
willingness to negotiate will avoid confrontations in the evalu-
ation sessions, but the outcome is more problematic:
 
✓ It causes confrontations. Instead of avoiding confronta-
tions in the evaluation sessions, the bargaining process 
actually opens the door to a good deal of heated debate 
and disagreement — and not over one or two points but 
over every point in the evaluation.
 
✓ It misses the point. Performance appraisals, by defini-
tion, are the managers’ assessments of their employees’ 
work. When employees are able to determine their final 
ratings, the accuracy, consistency, and fairness of the 
process suffer a serious decline.
 
✓ It rewards one behavior. Instead of basing ratings on 
performance across a broad range of work-related cat-
egories, bargaining ends up with ratings that are based 
heavily on the employees’ negotiating skills.
 
✓ It undercuts the self-evaluations. When managers 
bargain over the evaluations, self-ratings are no longer 
honest assessments of the employees’ own performance. 
Instead, these assessments are excessively high and 
resemble the opening offer in a negotiation session.
Talking too much
Another common mistake in the evaluation process occurs 
when managers spend more time talking than listening. These 
performance evaluation sessions are a dialogue, a time for 
you and your employees to openly discuss performance, 
exchange ideas, review results and goals, and ask and answer 
questions.
When managers turn these dialogues into monologues, the 
employees typically stop listening after just a few minutes. At 
that point, all the managers’ comments become background 
noise, and the performance appraisals fall into the back-
ground as well.
 
When you hold evaluation sessions with your employees, 
keep a mental stopwatch focused on the amount of time that 
you’re talking. If you sense that you’re talking more than half 
the time, you need to do a lot more listening. Pay careful 

 Chapter 7: Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes 123
Surprising Your Employees
attention to your employees. Their words as well as their 
body language can tell you whether you’re talking too much.
Postponing the sessions
When a manager’s workload gets too intense, he may be 
tempted to postpone a performance evaluation session. But 
unless there is a real emergency, postponing an appraisal is a 
major mistake. Here’s why:
 
✓ It sends an undermining message. Postponing an 
appraisal meeting sends an immediate message that 
the process isn’t particularly significant. If you want 
your employees to be serious about the performance 
appraisal process, you have to take it seriously, too. And 
this means making a firm commitment to hold these ses-
sions as scheduled.
 
✓ It makes it easy for you to postpone the meeting again. 
When one performance appraisal session has been post-
poned, the likelihood of having it postponed in the future 
increases dramatically. Plus, when you postpone one 
employee’s performance appraisal session, you’re more 
likely to postpone other employees’ appraisal sessions.
 
✓ It’s demoralizing to the individual. If you postpone only 
one performance appraisal session while holding all the 
others, the employee whose meeting is postponed is 
given a negative message — whether you intend it or not. 
The message is that he isn’t as important as the other 
employees.
Surprising Your Employees
When managers surprise their employees in the performance 
appraisal sessions by providing ratings that are grossly 
different from what the employees expected, the managers 
have made one of the most fundamental errors in the entire 
process.
Throughout the evaluation period, employees should have a 
clear and accurate understanding of the effectiveness of their 
performance in every key area. When you practice managing 
by wandering around, you’re doing more than observing the 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
124
Surprising Your Employees
performance of your employees, documenting what you see, 
and establishing a log that will be vital when formulating the 
employees’ evaluations at the end of the evaluation period.
Your role when wandering around includes providing ongo-
ing coaching, guidance, and feedback to your employees. 
You’re providing this feedback very close to the employees’ 
behaviors, and you’re providing it on a formal, as well as an 
informal, basis (including sit-down mini-evaluations at several 
points).
The result is that employees know exactly how they’re doing 
every day, and they have a clear idea of the areas of their per-
formance that are going well, along with those where improve-
ment is needed. As a result of the feedback and guidance that 
you’re regularly providing, your employees are taking regular 
and continuous steps each day to upgrade their performance 
and effectiveness on the job.

ome of the most important steps in the performance 
appraisal process are those that you take after you’ve 
completed the evaluation sessions with your employees. 
These follow-up actions are steppingstones to enhance your 
employees’ performance, productivity, and development.
 
Performance appraisal is no longer an annual stand-alone 
program. Instead, it’s an integral component of the overall 
process of performance management, functioning as part of a 
five-step cycle:
 
1. Goal setting
 
 Managers and employees meet and jointly establish 
specific performance and developmental goals. These 
goals are based in part on data and ratings produced 
in the performance evaluations.
 
2. Ongoing coaching
 
 Managers provide intermittent formal and informal 
feedback, guidance, and support to their employees 
throughout the evaluation period.
 
3. Self-evaluations
 
 As the time for the annual appraisal approaches, the 
employees complete their own evaluations, only this 
time they know exactly how they’ve performed.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
126
 Setting Goals
 
4. Performance evaluations.
 
 Managers review all the performance data and 
complete the formal evaluations of their employees.
 
5. Evaluation sessions.
 
 Managers meet with their employees individually 
to go over the formal performance evaluations, but 
the tension and apprehension are all but eliminated 
because there are no surprises.
After these evaluation sessions, the next step is a return to 
Step 1, goal setting. And the cycle starts anew.
In this chapter, I cover Step 1 of the performance appraisal 
process — everything that happens after you’ve held your 
evaluation session and you start all over again.
Setting Goals
There isn’t much point in providing your employees with a 
stack of feedback if nothing is done with it. Simply turning the 
employees loose and telling them that you expect to see some 
improvement is tantamount to turning your back on your 
employees and on the appraisal process itself. When your 
employees see your lack of involvement and support, they’re 
likely to take that stack of feedback and toss it aside.
If you want to raise an employee’s performance to the next 
level, your most useful and compelling tool is your completed 
performance appraisal. That completed appraisal opens the 
door to goal setting, and the goals that you establish with 
each of your employees are at the heart of their motivation, 
development, and success.
Looking forward instead 
of backward
Up to this point in the performance appraisal process, your 
focus has been on the past. You’ve gathered reams of data 
on your employees’ successes, failures, strengths, and 
weaknesses. You’ve amassed this information by tapping 
every conceivable source and resource to fill in any blanks 
from the previous year.
126

 Chapter 8: Following Up 127
 Setting Goals
Now it’s time to look at the upcoming year, and that’s the focus 
of goal setting. At this point in the process, you’re turning
around to face the future with your employees. And the notion 
of turning around is particularly appropriate because these 
goals can truly help stage a turnaround for any of your 
employees who may be struggling.
Your employees’ futures are filled with opportunities to build 
their competencies, achieve outstanding results, and take their 
overall performance to new heights. By working with your 
employees to help establish their goals, and then providing 
them with coaching, guidance, and support along the way, 
you’re creating the perfect climate for them to grow, and for 
their performance and effectiveness to do likewise. And if this 
happens, it’ll be reflected in every aspect of your employees’ 
work, as well as in their appraisals at the end of the next 
evaluation period.
 
Managers who keep focusing on their employees’ pasts instead 
of their futures tend to dwell on problems and failures, which 
sets the stage for repeat performances in the coming year.
Opting for goals over dreams
Say you have an employee who says that his goal is to do a 
better job in every area next year. That sounds great, except 
for one little problem: It’s not a goal.
Your employee has actually articulated a dream, essentially 
a general wish or desire for a particular outcome. Nothing is 
wrong with dreams, but just having a dream doesn’t mean it’ll 
come true. If your employees want to turn their dreams into 
reality, they need to formulate them as goals.
Real goals have several distinct characteristics in common:
 
✓ Goals are specific. When your employees have real 
goals, nothing about them is general. Their goals won’t 
be just to improve performance; instead, their goals 
will focus directly on the precise aspect or aspects of 
performance that they’re aiming to improve.
 
✓ Goals are realistic. Your employees’ goals need to be 
appropriate for their position, responsibilities, and 
training. Real goals don’t impose expectations that are 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
128
 Setting Goals
totally unrelated to the employees’ knowledge, skills, 
abilities, or standards.
 
✓ Goals are prioritized. All goals are not the same. Some are 
clearly critical and high priority, while others are impor-
tant but lower in priority. As a result, every goal should 
have a clear and identifiable priority associated with it. 
Whether it’s a numerical or alphabetical ranking makes 
no difference. What does make a difference is that the 
employee understands the priority associated with each 
goal and takes care of the most important goals first.
 
✓ Goals are measurable. As an employee pursues her 
goals, she and you need to know exactly where she is in 
the process. And, even more important, you both need to 
know if and when she’s met a particular goal. As a result, 
true goals have a quantitative quality that allows them 
to be clearly measured at every point along the way. 
Because goals are measurable, employees and managers 
know exactly how the employees are performing every 
step of the way. At the end of the day, or at the end of the 
evaluation period, neither you nor your employee has 
any questions about goal attainment.
 
✓ Goals are reachable. Goals should certainly be chal-
lenging, but they should also be attainable. Granted, 
they should stretch your employees, but people can 
only stretch so far. If a goal is truly out of an employee’s 
reach, it isn’t truly a goal.
 
✓ Goals are supported by action plans. In order for your 
employees to reach their goals, the goals need to encom-
pass clear planning. Action plans should include dates 
and deadlines, along with expected levels of project 
completion or goal attainment associated with each 
benchmark date. These plans set the path for employees to 
follow as they pursue their goals. Without action plans, 
employees may see where they want to go, but they 
don’t know how to get there.
 
 As you work with your employees to establish action 
plans, think of yourself as a reporter and ask lots of 
questions that start with who, what, where, when, why, 
and how.
 
If even one of the preceding elements is missing, it’s back to 
dreamland.

 Chapter 8: Following Up 129
 Setting Goals
The preceding characteristics of goals apply whether you’re 
talking about a performance goal or a personal goal. But when 
it comes to goal-setting in the workplace, performance goals 
need to meet the following guidelines, too:
 
✓ Performance goals should be aligned with the 
organization’s goals. Performance goals should support 
the style, standards, ethics, vision, and mission of your 
company.
 
✓ Performance goals should be linked to your goals. The 
idea is that the employees’ goals should support the 
goals of their manager. As a result, when your employees 
reach their goals, it should help you meet yours. In turn, 
the attainment of your goals should help your manager 
meet her goals. In this way, the employees’ goals from 
level to level are linked together and aligned with the 
goals of the company’s top leadership.
 
✓ Both you and your employees should agree on their 
performance goals. When you’ve finished helping your 
employees formulate their goals for the coming year, the 
process should end with total understanding and agree-
ment. If there are questions, doubts, or concerns, you need 
to address and resolve them before anything is finalized.
Motivating your employees 
to meet their goals
Just because you and your employees have been working on 
setting goals doesn’t automatically mean that your employees 
will be motivated to reach them.
 
When goals are simply dumped on employees, without any 
employee involvement or input, and without any consideration 
of the employees’ needs, the goals are likely to be rejected and, 
thus, void of any motivational impact. One of the key steps in 
establishing goals that are truly motivational is to establish 
them with your employees, rather than for your employees.
 
The presence of goals doesn’t necessarily mean that employees 
will be motivated, but the lack of goals undercuts the likelihood 
of any significant motivation. After all, motivation energizes 
employees to take action to move toward a particular goal. If 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
130
 Setting Goals
there are no goals to meet down the road, the employees will 
have no particular drive to get there.
 
If your employees sense a link between fulfillment of their 
needs and the goals that you jointly establish with them, the 
goals are likely to have more of a motivational impact. For 
example, if the employees’ needs are focused on receiving 
recognition for successful performance, and your policy is to 
provide recognition for excellent work, your employees are 
likely to be motivated to do a great job.
Challenging your employees 
enough but not too much
When establishing goals with your employees, you need to 
give some extra thought to the level of difficulty of the goals 
themselves.
Extremely challenging goals
Some managers believe that goals should be as challenging 
as possible. The hope is that, if goals are extremely difficult 
or maybe even impossible to reach, employees will be highly 
motivated to reach them. Such challenging goals will energize 
employees to push themselves to great lengths, well beyond 
their normal efforts. And by doing so, they’ll have raised their 
performance and surpassed the milestones and standards 
associated with less-rigorous goals.
Managers who subscribe to this theory believe that, when faced 
with impossible goals, some employees will rise to the occasion. 
Plus, even if employees aren’t able to reach these goals, they’ll 
have the satisfaction of truly exerting themselves in the pursuit 
of goals that would’ve scared away less-hearty souls.
Here’s the reality: When goals are nothing short of impossible, 
the employees may initially hit the ground running, but as they 
realize that the goals pose insurmountable barriers, and as 
their efforts to reach those goals lead to backsliding, the out-
come is a motivational meltdown. Most employees reason that 
if goals absolutely can’t be met, there’s no point in even trying.

 Chapter 8: Following Up 131
 Setting Goals
Extremely easy goals
At the other end of the continuum, some managers believe that 
easily attainable goals are the most motivational. The idea is 
that, when employees meet their goals, whatever the goals may 
be, they experience a strong sense of accomplishment, and 
that’s a strong source of motivation.
Plus, when employees reach their goals, they get recognition 
from their managers, which is yet another motivator. And 
when employees meet their goals, they experience increases 
in self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-image, all obviously 
positive outcomes. Hence, the reasoning goes, because 
employees are motivated to receive these psychological 
rewards, it makes sense to provide them with numerous 
opportunities to do so, and this is just what easy goals will do.
Here’s the reality: Easily attained goals don’t even register on 
the motivation scale. When employees can exert little or no 
effort and reach their goals, the message is that such goals 
are insignificant and meaningless.
When employees meet too-easy goals, they don’t experience 
feelings of achievement or accomplishment. Instead, the goals 
are so minor that the employees who reach them believe that 
they haven’t achieved or accomplished much of anything.
When goals can be reached with minimal effort by anyone 
who strolls into the department, they’re void of any of the 
feelings of success that accompany the attainment of 
serious and significant goals. In fact, some employees are 
actually embarrassed when granted recognition for meeting 
unchallenging goals.
 
When goals are viewed by the employees as frivolous, 
simple, insignificant, and meaningless, they contribute more 
to disinterest and dissatisfaction than they do to motivation. 
After all, if a basketball hoop is 1 foot high and the size of a 
swimming pool, there isn’t much satisfaction associated with 
hitting a shot — and there isn’t much fun in that either.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
132
 Looking at the Types of Goals
Challenging goals
Goals that have a positive motivational impact are challenging, 
but they must be realistically challenging. They aren’t a walk 
in the park, nor do they call for your employees to walk on 
Mars. Instead, they require a good deal of work on projects 
that are demanding, significant, and meaningful.
 
There is no guarantee that your employees will meet challenging 
goals, but with serious effort, energy, drive, and focus — along 
with support, guidance, and feedback from you — there is a 
chance that your employees will experience a major success. 
And with that success will come meaningful recognition and 
a true sense of achievement and accomplishment, which is 
highly motivational.
Looking at the Types of Goals
When you completed the appraisals of your employees, you 
gave each individual ratings in a wide range of work-related 
categories. You can now look back at these evaluations and use 
each employee’s specific ratings as the basis for goal setting.
In fact, these ratings provide the ideal starting point for 
establishing the two most important types of goals in the 
workplace: performance goals and developmental goals.
Performance goals
When you create performance goals with your employees, 
place your emphasis on jointly establishing clear, specific, mea-
surable, and meaningful objectives in three interrelated areas:
 
✓ Output and results goals: Goals in this area focus on 
quantitative measures of productivity, yield, and results 
that the employees are expected to achieve. For example, 
goals in this area can be targeted at numbers of units 
produced, hours billed, claims handled, or sales closed.
 
✓ Competency goals: These goals focus on the way in which 
your employees carry out their job responsibilities and 
strive to build their output and productivity. Goals in this 
arena focus on such measurables as quantity and quality 
of work, interpersonal skills, leadership effectiveness, job 

 Chapter 8: Following Up 133
 Looking at the Types of Goals
knowledge and expertise, communication skills, planning 
and administration, and problem solving.
 
✓ Behavioral goals: These goals focus on the specific 
behaviors that your employees demonstrate every day 
while carrying out their various job responsibilities. 
Goals in this area deal with targeted improvements in 
such areas as attitude, friendliness, dedication, energy, 
handling pressure, and supporting the company’s values 
and mission.
Developmental goals
As you work with your employees to establish their perfor-
mance goals, you also need to use this opportunity to estab-
lish additional goals that focus on your employees’ growth, 
learning, and development.
In order to set developmental goals that actually enhance 
your employees’ knowledge, skills, abilities, and effectiveness 
on the job, you need to keep in mind some key points all the 
way through the goal-setting process.
Identifying each employee’s needs
Some of your employees will have individual areas in which 
their performance falls short. When working with them to 
create developmental goals, the first step is to identify the 
areas in which further development is actually needed — for 
example, in terms of leadership, communication, teamwork, 
or administrative and planning skills.
The best source of this type of information is each individual 
employee’s evaluation. Take a close look at the areas in which 
you gave relatively low ratings, consider the significance of 
each area, and then select those that are most critical for 
effective performance and success on the job.
This is also an excellent time to review any 360-degree feedback 
(if your company has such a program). Whether you used 
this feedback as part of the employees’ evaluations or not, 
360-degree feedback is very helpful for identifying areas in 
which further development may be warranted.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
134
 Looking at the Types of Goals
 
A good deal of development is focused on areas in which 
employee performance needs some improvement, but don’t 
forget to also take a look at the areas in which your employees 
performed particularly well. These areas may be significant 
strengths already, and with additional development, they 
can grow into major assets for the company as well as for the 
employees themselves.
Building your employees’ motivation to learn
If you just take the findings from the evaluations and throw 
your employees into a training program, the outcome is likely 
to be underwhelming at best. In order for true learning to 
occur, the participants in any kind of educational program 
should be motivated to learn. Without motivation, any efforts 
to build their skills and upgrade their knowledge will be little 
more than background noise.
 
One of the best ways to increase your employees’ motivation 
to learn is to make sure that their thoughts, ideas, and opinions 
are included in designing their developmental program. 
Have individual meetings and open discussions with each of 
your employees to make sure that they have input in their 
developmental program. As part of these discussions, be sure 
to let your employees see how they can benefit by meeting 
their developmental goals.
Establishing developmental goals
With your employees’ developmental needs clearly identified, 
and the employees’ inputs included in the process, you’re ready 
to jointly establish developmental goals. Developmental goals 
clearly outline the performance areas where your employees 
will pursue development, as well as the specific outcomes 
they’ll be seeking in each. Developmental objectives are held 
to the same standards of specificity, measurement, challenge, 
and prioritization as the employees’ performance goals.
For example, assume that one of your employees is starting 
to take on some leadership responsibilities, and she clearly 
shows potential for advancement. However, she hasn’t had 
any formal leadership training. One developmental goal would 
be focused on building her leadership skills by having her 
spend a specific number of hours in leadership training and 
guided leadership experiences. The action plan for this 
developmental goal would include specific benchmarks 
regarding classes and seminars to attend, articles and books 

 Chapter 8: Following Up 135
 Looking at the Types of Goals
to read, predetermined and closely monitored leadership 
opportunities, and predetermined formal feedback and 
coaching sessions to review her effectiveness in these 
leadership roles.
Setting the developmental plan
As soon as you and your employees have agreed on the 
developmental goals, as in the case of establishing performance 
goals, the next step is to create a thorough plan to energize 
and guide the process throughout the evaluation period. This 
step-by-step plan includes developmental areas to be covered, 
resources required, programs to attend, training materials 
needed, commitments from other employees who will help, 
follow-up meetings, and clearly defined benchmarks and 
deadlines.
Setting up a developmental training program
As you and your employees review the various developmental 
options and educational programs, pay attention to seven key 
factors that are the hallmarks of better programs:
 
✓ The program should emphasize learning by experience.
 
✓ Your employees should have numerous opportunities to 
practice their newly acquired knowledge and skills.
 
✓ Your employees should receive prompt, accurate, and 
supportive feedback every step of the way.
 
✓ The educational atmosphere should be open, communi-
cative, and highly receptive to questions and discussions.
 
✓ The material being covered should be directly applicable 
to what your employees will be doing on the job.
 
✓ There should be varying educational techniques to 
identify and build on the individual learning styles of 
your employees.
 
✓ The program should be evaluated on the basis of the 
actual results that are achieved. For example, if the pro-
gram is designed to help employees deal more effectively 
with customers, there should be a decrease in customer 
complaints.
Some educational programs use questionnaires to evaluate 
their effectiveness, but the questions miss the mark because 
they either ask the employees if they enjoyed the program or 

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
136
 Managing after the Evaluation
test the employees on what they learned. The problem is, the 
employees may enjoy a program but learn absolutely nothing. 
Or they may learn a laundry list of information but have no 
idea how to apply any of it.
 
One of the most effective ways to evaluate the effectiveness of 
these types of programs is to look at subsequent employee 
behaviors and performance results.
 
Employees generate much of their knowledge while on the 
job, and you’re their primary trainer. They’re learning not 
only from the formal sessions that you provide, but also from 
the example that you’re setting every day. You’re their central 
role model, and that makes you their most compelling trainer.
Managing after the Evaluation
As soon as you and your employees have jointly created and 
agreed upon performance and developmental goals for the 
current evaluation period, your role as a manager includes 
ongoing and regular communication, contact, and coaching.
This doesn’t mean that you’ll be sacrificing any of your 
core job responsibilities (for example, in terms of planning, 
organizing, problem solving, or dealing with customers or 
vendors). Instead, you’ll be balancing your more traditional 
managerial responsibilities with responsibilities that focus on 
the most important assets in the company — your employees.
Wandering around
Wandering around is one of the best ways to monitor your 
employees’ progress as they strive to reach their goals. If you 
observe your employees making great strides, you can easily 
provide some informal feedback that helps them understand 
how they’re doing, while simultaneously encouraging them to 
continue the same successful behaviors.
At the same time, if you find your employees falling short for 
any reason, you’re literally in an advantageous position to do 
something about it. Had you not been wandering around, you 
might have learned about the issue at a later date (when it 
turned into a crisis), or you might not have learned about it 
at all.

 Chapter 8: Following Up 137
 Managing after the Evaluation
By wandering around, not only will you be able to quickly 
spot specific problems early, but you’ll also be able to take 
proactive steps to control and correct them. Plus, your on-site 
observation will give you much greater insight into the cause 
or causes of the problems, and that will help you set the stage 
to prevent recurrences in the future.
 
While you’re wandering around, try also to treat the process 
as managing by wondering around: Do more than observe 
and gather data. Try to understand the reasons behind the 
behaviors and outcomes that you’re observing. With such 
knowledge, you’re even better armed to prevent recurrences.
Coaching your employees 
toward their goals
When you find your employees engaging in particularly 
productive behaviors, you can take some powerful steps to 
keep them on this positive track. Plus, when you find your 
employees engaging in behaviors and outcomes that aren’t 
helping them advance toward their goals, you can take 
equally powerful steps to help them get back on track. In both 
cases, you can generate these positive outcomes by playing 
one of the most important roles in management today: the 
role of the coach.
Some managers regard coaching as occasional words of 
encouragement or casual suggestions. Coaches do engage in 
these behaviors, but there’s more to coaching than this.
Coaching is actually an ongoing managerial function in which 
you work with your employees to build their strengths and 
competencies, draw out their most effective and productive 
behaviors, help them identify and surpass obstacles, provide 
them with counseling for counterproductive behaviors, and 
keep them on target as they follow their developmental plans 
and pursue their goals.
When you see your employees engaging in particularly 
effective behaviors, give them some words of encouragement. 
This type of positive feedback increases the likelihood that 
they’ll repeat these behaviors.

Part II: Working Your Way through the Process 
138
 Managing after the Evaluation
At the same time, if your employees are engaging in behaviors 
that appear to be counterproductive, how you respond 
depends on how serious the problems are. If the employees’ 
actions aren’t particularly serious, a few words to the wise, 
preferably not in front of others, are probably all that is 
necessary.
 
However, if the behaviors are more problematic, meet with 
the employees to review the issue in more detail. When you 
do so, keep the following key points in mind:
 
✓ Meet with your employee as close to the problematic 
behavior as possible.
 
✓ Hold the meeting in private.
 
✓ Be specific in describing the questionable performance 
and the problems that emerged or can emerge as a result.
 
✓ Provide clear and specific guidance and modeling.
 
✓ Be sure your employee understands and agrees to 
change his behavior.
 
✓ Tell your employee what will happen if the questionable 
performance continues.
 
✓ Set a follow-up date, preferably within 30 days, to meet 
with your employee to discuss the status of the situation.
 
✓ Document the discussion and place a copy in your 
employee’s file.
 
✓ In your wandering around, be sure to follow up on this 
specific aspect of your employee’s performance.
 
Whether you observe your employees taking actions that are 
outstanding or unacceptable, be sure to enter them in the log 
that you use when formulating their performance evaluations.
By acting as a coach, you’re providing your employees 
with regular feedback, guidance, and direction, whether 
for problematic behaviors or productive behaviors. You’re 
helping to build their performance, competencies, and 
behaviors, while simultaneously helping them advance 
toward their goals.

In this part . . .
T
hese chapters contain more than 3,200 appraisal

gamut from exceptional all the way to unsatisfactory. 
There are phrases for every occasion, and, no doubt, 
occasions for every phrase.
The phrases in the positive categories are designed to 
encourage and motivate your employees to keep up the 
good work. At the same time, the phrases in the less-than-
satisfactory range are designed to identify areas where 
your employees need to improve, as well as to open the 
door to productive discussions on this very matter.

Chapter 9
The Best Phrases for Quality 
and Quantity of Work
In This Chapter
▶ Building and reinforcing employee output
▶ Identifying and enhancing employee thoroughness
▶ Assessing and rewarding time-management skills
T
wo primary areas of emphasis in the performance appraisal 
process are the quality and quantity of each employee’s 
work. Quality and quantity are two central performance 
measures for which employees need thorough and accurate 
feedback. Regardless of performance, when such feedback is 
questionable, productivity is likely to be questionable, too.
Your written comments are a great opportunity to provide 
employees with complete and long-lasting feedback on the 
quality and quantity of their work. On the one hand, writing a 
general statement indicating that an employee needs to pro-
duce more or do a neater job is easy; so is simply writing a 
statement that there are no quality or quantity problems. But 
these comments have no impact when it comes to sustaining 
excellent performance or improving marginal performance.
In order for your written feedback to have a long-lasting impact, 
you need to focus on the individual performance factors that 
determine the quality and quantity of your employees’ work, 
such as accuracy, detail-mindedness, productivity, multi-tasking, 
and setting priorities, to name just a few. The best strategy is 
to include targeted phrases that energize an employee to keep 
up the good work in key areas, while also encouraging employ-
ees to focus more carefully on the quality and quantity of their 
work where needed. This chapter provides you with the full 
spectrum of those phrases.

The Best Phrases for 
Communication and 
Interpersonal Skills
In This Chapter
▶ Spotlighting communication strengths and areas for improvement
▶ Recognizing and enhancing team building
▶ Rewarding and rebuilding people skills
I
n order for your employees to effectively carry out their 
responsibilities and meet their short-term and long-term 
objectives, they need to know how well they’re communicating 
and dealing with others.
Ironically, some managers have difficulty communicating 
assessments in these two areas, especially when it comes to 
written comments. They’re concerned that their feedback 
on communication won’t be communicated clearly, and they 
worry that providing feedback on interpersonal relations will 
actually strain the working relationships instead of improving 
them. When written comments focus on vague and general 
trends and themes, these outcomes are the most likely.
Communication skills and interpersonal skills are actually 
composed of numerous factors — such as cooperation, 
teamwork, listening, negotiating, and telephone skills — all 
of which lend themselves to appraisal. If any one of these 
factors is overlooked in the appraisal process, opportunities 
for recognition and personal growth will be diminished. This 
chapter targets the key factors that determine effectiveness in 
communications and interpersonal skills and provides the full 
continuum of performance appraisal phrases for each.

The Best Phrases for 
Planning, Administration, 
and Organization
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing and enhancing managerial behaviors
▶ Highlighting organizational skills and filling the gaps
▶ Identifying and reinforcing goal attainment
A
s employees pursue challenging goals, they may be 
bursting with energy and enthusiasm, but their perfor-
mance can fall terribly short because of issues related to plan-
ning, administration, and organization. Such matters are often 
regarded solely as managerial functions, but the truth is that, 
every day, employees at every job level are taking specific 
actions in these arenas, along with numerous related actions 
to keep their work on track, on target, and on time.
In addition to feedback that is targeted on the employees’ 
planning and organizing skills, there is a real need for feed-
back in such related areas as managing, meeting deadlines, 
sticking to schedules, watching costs, establishing goals, and 
adjusting to change. Feedback in each of these areas provides 
employees with recognition where due, as well as with direc-
tion and encouragement where needed.
Because much of the information that employees receive on 
matters of planning and organizing is in written form, it’s 
particularly important for written feedback in this area to be 
clear, focused, and functional. Employees have a wide range 
of planning and organizational responsibilities, and this chap-
ter provides an equally wide range of performance appraisal 
phrases to cover employees’ performance in each.

The Best Phrases for 
Leadership
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying and enhancing leadership skills
▶ Strengthening the capacity to energize others
▶ Spotlighting skills that build individuals as well as teams
L
eadership is about influencing others to reach established 
goals. As such, it’s one of the most critical roles in any 
company. Leadership maintains the vision, values, culture, 
objectives, and standards for the company, and when leadership 
is in doubt, the company is in trouble.
As a result, accurately appraising the leadership skills of 
anyone who plays a leadership role is critical. This stretches 
from upper management all the way to employees who have 
no formal leadership titles but carry out occasional leadership 
functions, such as chairing a committee or running an event. 
If you look at all your employees, you’ll see that many of them 
have leadership responsibilities, regardless of their titles.
Leadership isn’t a one-dimensional behavior that’s either 
present or not. Instead, it’s an amalgam of many functions — 
including such leadership-related responsibilities as motivating 
employees, building employees’ skills, providing feedback, 
screening and hiring, managing conflict, coaching, making 
decisions, delegating, and more — all of which need to be 
reviewed as part of a thorough performance appraisal.
In light of the critical role that leadership plays in any 
organization, choosing the right words in the appraisal 
process is important — not only for the success of your 
employees, but for the success of your company as well.

Chapter 13
The Best Phrases for Job 
Knowledge and Expertise
In This Chapter
▶ Encouraging the accumulation and application of knowledge
▶ Reinforcing technical skills that contribute to success
▶ Fostering the spread of productive information
Your employees’ knowledge, expertise, and skills are 
central to success on the job, and they require specific 
attention in the performance appraisal process. But there’s 
more to these factors than meets the eye.
When appraising your employees in this area, you may be 
tempted to focus on the amount of information they’ve 
amassed, and then appraise them solely on this factor. 
However, such appraisals are more appropriate for computer 
chips than for human beings.
In addition to appraising your employees’ overall levels of 
knowledge, you need to appraise the degree to which they are 
able to productively apply this knowledge to the job. After all, 
an employee may be a storehouse of wisdom, but if he keeps 
the storehouse locked, there isn’t much value to it.
The most powerful phrases in this area focus not only on 
employees’ knowledge, expertise, and technical skills, but 
also on the ways in which employees apply these factors to 
their work. With this in mind, phrases focus on such behav-
iors as sharing knowledge, building employees’ skills, mentor-
ing, researching, serving as a positive role model, and more.
In light of the key role played by job knowledge, you want 
to make sure to use knowledgeable phrases when providing 
feedback in this area.

The Best Phrases for 
Attitude
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing and encouraging enthusiasm toward the job
▶ Identifying and rewarding steady and consistent performance
▶ Targeting and fortifying behaviors that demonstrate loyalty
O
ne of the most common themes in performance 
appraisals is focused on employee attitude. Unfortunately, 
much of the feedback concerning attitude is marginally useful 
at best. The problem is that attitude is a term that has many 
components, and simply advising an employee that she has a 
great attitude or a poor attitude is not particularly helpful.
Overarching positive comments about super attitudes provide 
no information regarding behaviors for an employee to 
continue, while overarching negative comments about terrible 
attitudes provide no information regarding behaviors for the 
employee to eliminate. Plus, vague or general feedback in this 
area can actually chip away at the employees’ attitudes.
As a result, the most effective way to provide meaningful 
feedback in this area is to use descriptive phrases that 
focus directly on the most compelling behaviors that reflect 
employee attitudes at work, such as attendance, dedication, 
commitment, reliability, initiative, energy, handling of 
pressure and stress, and more.
When providing feedback in this area, keep in mind that, as 
an employee improves his performance, his attitude improves 
as well.

The Best Phrases for Ethics
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying and filling ethical gaps
▶ Highlighting and energizing equitable behaviors
▶ Aligning employee actions with company values
E
thical issues in the workplace have always been important. 
They bring down individuals as well as companies. Most 
people are aware of the damages that ethical shortcomings 
can wreak on a company, but many people don’t realize that a 
strong performance appraisal system can play a critical 
preventive role.
Performance appraisals, accompanied by ongoing coaching 
and feedback, have the potential to identify and arrest unethical 
behaviors before they lead to a different kind of arrest. With 
feedback and guidance from solid performance appraisal 
systems, unethical behaviors are likely to be identified and 
stopped in their earliest stages.
In order to stop these breaches of ethics, appraisals need to 
do more than merely advise an employee that he’s been acting 
unethically. In order for feedback regarding unethical behavior 
to have a lasting impact, it needs to target specific unethical acts.
This chapter focuses on the broad range of written comments 
that deal with the broad range of unethical behaviors. These 
phrases focus on employee behaviors in such areas as equal 
employment opportunity, diversity, sustainability, honesty, 
integrity, fairness, and more.
With strong feedback in each of these specific areas, you can 
prevent unethical behaviors from expanding and contaminating 
your company.

The Best Phrases for 
Creative Thinking
In This Chapter
▶ Sharpening the tools that build creative thinking
▶ Creating a climate that supports innovative ideas
▶ Overcoming the barriers that prevent creative problem solving
O
ne of the hallmarks of successful employees is their 
ability to think creatively and develop innovative 
solutions to the vast number of problems they encounter on 
the job. Companies that support this type of thinking are not 
only better able to cope with today’s myriad challenges, but 
also to predict and prepare for tomorrow’s challenges.
Identifying, enhancing, and reinforcing your employees’ efforts 
to engage in creative thinking is critical. You should be doing 
this informally throughout the evaluation period, and you 
should specifically target this area during the formal reviews.
Your appraisal will do more than provide your employees 
with specific and accurate feedback regarding their efforts to 
apply and support creativity on the job. It will also provide 
them with tools to build their skills in this area, along with 
guidance and support to help them do so.
You need to appraise key behaviors that relate to creative 
thinking on the job, such as generating new ideas, being 
receptive to new ideas, thinking outside the box, encouraging 
and supporting innovation from others, and more.
The phrases in this chapter are designed to reflect and 
encourage creative thinking.

The Best Phrases for Self-
Development and Growth
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying and widening each employee’s knowledge base and skills
▶ Reviewing and revitalizing self-development plans and goals
▶ Increasing the value of each employee
O
ne of the major objectives of performance appraisals 
is to provide employees with targeted feedback and 
guidance to help them learn, grow, and develop. Without a 
developmental component, performance appraisals would 
be relegated to the role of a mirror, showing employees how 
their performance looks but providing no help, support, or 
guidance to do anything about it.
The developmental comments that you include in your 
performance appraisals will ultimately help your employees 
experience the satisfaction associated with increased personal 
growth and increased personal productivity. Plus, as employees 
become more effective and productive, the effectiveness and 
productivity of the company will be enhanced.
Employee self-development is not a one-dimensional concept. 
Instead, in order for feedback in this area to have its intended 
positive impact, it needs to focus on the key components of 
development and growth. You need to include instructive 
phrases on such topics as training, personal goals, career 
planning, seeking learning opportunities, building problem-
solving skills, widening one’s knowledge base, and more.
Employees and employers alike seek growth and development, 
and your phrases in this area will help both of them meet this 
goal.

n the well-established tradition of For Dummies books, 
the chapters in this part provide you with the ten 
most powerful, persuasive, and motivational words that 
you can use in the performance appraisal process, along 
with ten outstanding employee behaviors that merit 
special recognition. Communication plays a compelling 
role throughout the appraisal process, and these chapters 
provide you with extra communication tools that generate 
and sustain highly positive and productive performance 
from your employees.
That’s a powerful punch for such a pithy part!

Chapter 18
The Top Ten Words to 
Include in a Performance 
Appraisal
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing words that energize your employees
▶ Interspersing words that establish positive expectations
▶ Including words that inspire feelings of confidence and self-worth
O
ne of the most effective ways to enhance the impact of 
the appraisals you provide is to select words that have 
a strong positive emotional charge. You may think that as 
long as you somehow get your message across, your word 
choice isn’t all that important. After all, the message is what 
counts, right? The truth is, some words hit home far more 
quickly and compellingly than others.
In this chapter, I fill you in on ten positively charged words 
that pack a punch. By including them in your feedback, 
you greatly increase the likelihood that your comments will 
actually be heard and that your employees’ performance 
will actually improve.
The Employee’s Name
A person’s name is one of the most powerfully charged words 
that she knows. If it wasn’t the first word she ever heard, it’s 
certainly among the very earliest.

When someone hears her own name, she reacts. She may 
turn, jump, flinch, or smile, but regardless of the specific 
action, she’s not likely to ignore it, nor is she likely to 
ignore what happens after her name is called. By saying 
your employee’s name before providing her with feedback, 
you’re improving her readiness to listen carefully to your 
next words — and to act on them.
Achievement
Numerous studies have found the word achievement to 
be one of the premier sources of employee motivation. 
When employees hear the word achievement in your feed-
back, they’re better able to sense the significance of their 
accomplishments.
Your employees can certainly experience feelings of achieve-
ment as they carry out their work, and they can give them-
selves any number of positive messages. However, when they 
hear you use the word achievement, its true motivational 
impact is released. After all, you can tell yourself that you 
achieved an important landmark, but this feedback is far more 
compelling when voiced by your manager.
 
Providing your employees with feedback that incorporates 
the word achievement has another benefit: When your 
employees encounter future opportunities that offer the 
possibility of achievement-oriented feedback, they’re more 
likely to push themselves to go for the gold.
Build
The word build is literally and figuratively one of the most 
constructive words to use in the performance appraisal 
process. It has a strong positive connotation — the word build 
inherently assumes that something positive is going to be 
designed, created, and brought to life. In this way, the word 
build sets off positive emotions as soon as it’s heard or seen.
The word build also has a strong visual component. In fact, 
when most people see or hear the word build, it isn’t simply 
filed away with most other words. The more common 
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
318
Build

 Chapter 18: Ten Words to Include in a Performance Appraisal 319
Growth
tendency is to mentally envision completed structures, such 
as buildings and bridges. Because your employees are auto-
matically linking build with the successful completion of major 
projects, the word has a positive emotional charge.
The word build also implies an orderly, structured, and 
well-planned process with a real foundation. As a result, it 
connotes organized growth and development, and not a quick 
or superficial set of steps. Plus, most building projects are 
carried out by teams, which means that the word sends a 
subtle message that you’ll be teaming up with your employees 
to help them along their paths of development.
 
In light of the compelling and memorable impact associated 
with the word build, you should include it across the broad 
spectrum of employee performance — for example, when 
you’re talking about building productivity, output, relation-
ships, knowledge, skills, strengths, teamwork, performance, 
and profits.
Can
By using the word can when appraising your employees, 
you’re sending a subtle message — not only in terms of posi-
tive expectations but also in terms of your confidence in the 
employees’ abilities to perform successfully. The more your 
employees hear what they can do, the more likely they are to 
do it. When you lace your comments with can, you’re literally 
reinforcing your employees’ can-do attitude.
 
As important as it is to emphasize what your employees’ can 
do, it’s equally important to avoid the word can’t. The word 
can’t sends a negative message about your employees’ poten-
tial and can easily undermine their expectations and efforts.
Growth
There is no question that employees aspire to experience 
growth at work. However, growth is such a slow process that 
many employees aren’t sure whether it’s happening at all. In 
fact, because growth occurs in such minuscule snippets, some 
employees can miss it altogether.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
320
Promotion
By working with your employees each day, you can see 
growth when it occurs. In fact, you probably see more of 
your employees’ growth than anyone they know. That fact, 
in combination with the role that you play as their manager, 
provides you with extra insight and credibility when it 
comes to recognizing their growth.
However, if you don’t mention the word growth, your employ-
ees can still miss it, even if you glowingly describe their 
accomplishments. Employees want to know whether and how 
they’ve been growing, and by including the word growth in 
your comments, you can provide them with an answer that 
is clear, meaningful, and energizing. Plus, the use of this 
word continues to encourage your employees to repeat the 
behaviors that have helped them grow to this point.
Profit
The word profit has a strong emotional impact for employees 
at all levels of a company. As a result, it’s a very important 
word to use in the appraisal process. In fact, when profit 
is minimized in performance appraisals, it’s likely to be 
minimized in other ways as well.
There are actually two key reasons to use the word profit:
 
✓ Employees at all levels should be thinking about it. By 
keeping profit in mind, any employee becomes far more 
likely to take small or large steps to help the company be 
more successful.
 
✓ When employees hear your feedback and consider 
changing their behavior, they need to understand how 
they’ll benefit personally by making such changes. 
Many employees make decisions about changing their 
behavior as a result of performance appraisal feedback 
by asking themselves, “What’s in it for me?” One of the 
most effective ways to answer this question is to clearly 
show your employees how they will “profit” by taking 
the actions that you’re suggesting.
Promotion
Every employee remembers his first promotion with pride, 
and simply hearing the word promotion brings back at least a 

 Chapter 18: Ten Words to Include in a Performance Appraisal 321
Success
hint of those positive feelings. Plus, promotions have long 
been found to be a strong source of employee motivation. 
The result is that both of these factors contribute to the long-
lasting positive emotional charge associated with the word 
promotion.
In light of these two factors, plus the role that performance 
appraisal plays in the promotion process, using the word 
promotion is particularly important when appraising your 
employees’ performance.
 
The best time to use this word is when you’re discussing 
performance in areas that directly relate to advancement, 
such as your employees’ leadership abilities, technical 
knowledge, and communication skills. By specifically using 
promotion in this context, your employees are given a clearer 
understanding of the link between outstanding work in 
specific performance areas and advancement in the company.
 
Although using the word promotion is important, it’s equally 
important to avoid making any promises or commitments 
about promotions. Managers who make such promises to 
their employees may soon find that they’ve walked right into 
a contract.
Success
When providing positive feedback, you may be tempted to 
focus on numbers, dates, facts, and figures. However, the 
best way to make this type of information memorable and 
motivational is to include the word success in the process.
By including success as you review your employees’ success-
ful attainment of hard numbers, your words will have a more 
compelling impact. Although your feedback will still have its 
share of rates, ratios, and percentages, such data will be 
wrapped in a motivational package that gives your employees 
a strong sense of recognition and personal competence.
Employees may or may not take the numbers with them after 
your review session, but the powerful psychological impact 
of this type of recognition will stay with them for a long time. 
Plus, because recognition is such a strong motivator, your 
use of the word success increases the likelihood that your 
employees will repeat their excellent behaviors in the future.

Yes
Thanks
In light of the large amount of ground that you have to cover 
in performance appraisals, one powerful word that you can 
easily overlook is thanks. If you forget to use the word thanks, 
you’re losing a valuable and cost-effective opportunity to 
raise an employee’s spirits, morale, and sense of self-worth.
 
As you prepare your performance appraisals for each 
employee, try to single out one major accomplishment that 
made a truly positive difference in the department or com-
pany at large. During the appraisal session, after you discuss 
this particular achievement, pause for a second or two 
and then thank your employee. Don’t be surprised if your 
employee pauses for a second or two in return. She’ll 
probably be shocked, and that fact alone will allow your 
thanks to have a deep and lasting positive impact.
Yes
Most people are conditioned to react positively to the word 
yes because it’s associated with favorable outcomes in most 
areas of their lives. The word yes is particularly powerful 
because it plays a critical role in building mutual under-
standing and agreement. You want your employees to listen 
to your comments and act on them, and the more they hear 
the word yes, the more likely they are to do exactly that.
 
Some managers give the word yes a good deal of play but then 
undo all its power and effectiveness by attaching one little 
word to it — namely, the word but. When employees hear 
“Yes, but . . .” the word yes becomes a prelude to a 
rejection. As a result, that yes may as well be no, which is 
another word to avoid in the appraisal process.
 
The best way to benefit from the power of yes, and still add 
some points afterwards, is to say “Yes, and. . . .”
You can further strengthen the impact of your feedback by 
giving your employees more opportunities to say yes. One of 
the best ways to generate a yes is to end a sentence with a 
rhetorical question that can only generate a yes. For example, 
you’re reading this book right now, aren’t you?

The Top Ten Behaviors 
Meriting Special 
Recognition
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying special behaviors that deserve special attention
▶ Reinforcing behaviors that add value to the employee and to the 
company
▶ Increasing the likelihood that outstanding behaviors will be repeated
R
ecognition is one of the most powerful sources of 
employee motivation, and performance appraisals offer 
a perfect opportunity to formally identify and recognize 
your employees’ successes and achievements, whether in 
terms of their job performance or their personal growth and 
development. Although recognizing all of your employees’ 
accomplishments is important, ten behaviors jump off the 
chart and merit special recognition.
The common theme shared by these behaviors is that they 
demonstrate particularly high levels of dedication, commitment, 
and energy — all of which add significant value to the company. 
Plus, when one employee engages in these behaviors, some of 
her co-workers will likely follow suit because they, too, will be 
interested in receiving recognition from you.

If you want your employees to repeat these outstanding 
behaviors, the best step is to recognize them as you manage 
by wandering around and as you conduct performance 
appraisals.
 
Your employees learn from you every day, not only as a 
result of your direct guidance and mentoring but also as 
a result of your actions. So, another powerful way to draw 
out the top ten behaviors from your employees is to engage 
in them yourself.
Exceeding Expectations
Employees have the opportunity to exceed expectations in 
virtually every aspect of their jobs. They can exceed tangible 
and measurable expectations (such as the quality and quan-
tity of their work), as well as intangible expectations (such as 
their attitude or energy).
When employees exceed expectations, they don’t necessar-
ily do so as a result of your guidance or direction — they do 
it more as a result of their own initiative, drive, and personal 
standards of performance. Employees who exceed expecta-
tions typically derive a great deal of personal satisfaction out 
of doing so — and this satisfaction is enhanced and reinforced 
by the positive feedback that you provide, especially in your 
performance appraisals.
Mentoring Co-Workers
Employees who mentor others are actually demonstrating 
several excellent behaviors simultaneously, all of which are 
worthy of special recognition. First, in order to serve as a 
mentor, an employee must have a high degree of expertise, 
along with a full understanding of the company’s performance 
standards in the area in which he is mentoring.
Mentors also send clear messages about the company’s 
values, ethics, and mission. As a result, employees who serve 
as mentors are key purveyors of the company’s values — 
and that’s easily as important as their specific mentoring 
responsibilities.

324
Mentoring Co-Workers

 Chapter 19: The Top Ten Behaviors Meriting Special Recognition 325
Taking Classes
In addition, mentors must have solid training abilities that 
build and reinforce other employees’ skills. Plus, mentors 
must have solid organizational skills, allowing them to 
train other employees while simultaneously maintaining 
excellent levels of performance in carrying out their other 
responsibilities.
 
One of the most desirable characteristics of any employee is 
the ability to add value to the company, and mentors are able 
to do this in two ways:
 
✓ In order to mentor successfully, they must develop their 
own skills to expert levels, which clearly adds value to 
the company.
 
✓ When employees are mentored, their value to the 
company increases as well.
Taking Classes
When an employee takes classes, she’s demonstrating her 
strong desire not only to continue her learning, growth, 
and development but also to increase the value that she 
brings to her job and the company at large. In addition, the 
fact that she can take classes while successfully carrying out 
her job responsibilities is a testimony to her energy, drive, 
persistence, and organizational ability.
There is no question that your employees’ value to the com-
pany increases as they build their knowledge, skills, and 
abilities. Plus, their emphasis on learning indicates that these 
employees have maintained their intellectual curiosity and in 
no way see themselves slowing down, burning out, or topping 
out. Their desire to further their education is a clear sign that 
they continue to be motivated to achieve, advance, and play 
increasingly important roles in the company.
 
Although education is its own reward, the special recognition 
that you provide to your employees in this area literally makes 
education more rewarding.

Taking Self-sacrificing Actions
Coming Up with a 
Great New Idea
Great new ideas merit great recognition. When your employ-
ees come up with truly outstanding ideas, such as those that 
save money, generate money, highlight better ways to get a 
job done, or build significant goodwill, you should give them 
special recognition — not only when they come up with the 
idea but also during the performance appraisal.
In order for your recognition to have the maximum impact, 
be sure to focus not only on the outstanding idea but also on 
the underlying factors that brought it to life. These ideas are 
actually the result of a combination of creative thinking, persis-
tence, dedication, self-direction, and a strong need to achieve.
 
When your employees generate great ideas, the message 
to your own manager is that you’ve created a climate that 
focuses on innovation and creative thinking — which can lead 
to some great recognition for you, too!
Taking Self-sacrificing Actions
Providing recognition to your employees who place their own 
needs and priorities behind those of the company is particu-
larly important. These employees are willing to set aside their 
own plans and step up to work on serious situations that are 
spinning out of control, such as rescuing a difficult and 
demanding project, taking care of an unhappy customer, 
calming a volatile situation, or handling emergencies.
The recognition that you provide for self-sacrificing behaviors 
should encompass more than the behaviors themselves. Your 
special recognition should also focus upon your employees’ 
expertise in the situations that called for such sacrifices, 
as well as upon your employees’ loyalty, commitment, and 
strong sense of responsibility.

 Chapter 19: The Top Ten Behaviors Meriting Special Recognition 327
Volunteering
Solving a Long-term Problem
Some of the toughest problems to solve in a company are 
resistant to efforts of some of the best problem solvers. 
These problems can exist in any area and include any aspect 
of company operations. They can be as varied as turnover, 
slow-paying customers, product design, system glitches, and 
turf wars between departments, to name just a few.
However, at some point or another, someone comes up with 
a perfect solution to one of these problems. If one of your 
employees is the problem solver, she clearly merits special 
recognition from you.
 
The bulk of your recognition should naturally focus on excel-
lent problem-solving skills, but you should provide equally 
compelling recognition for the behaviors that accompanied 
your employee’s problem-solving success, including her 
persistence, inquisitiveness, innovative problem-solving style, 
and refusal to give up.
Volunteering
When employees volunteer to serve on committees, help with 
special events and programs, or undertake additional projects, 
they’re demonstrating behaviors that contribute to their own 
growth and development, while also helping the company — 
and both of these actions merit special recognition.
As companies solicit volunteers for various projects, employ-
ees who step up are demonstrating their desire to be part 
of the team and take hands-on actions to help the company 
meet its objectives. Underneath each act of volunteerism 
is a strong sense of loyalty, dedication, and a desire to make a 
contribution to the company.
Plus, when employees perform successfully in various volun-
tary roles, while performing equally well in carrying out 
their formal job responsibilities, they’re demonstrating solid 
planning and organizing skills. Such skills are worthy not only 
of special recognition but also of special consideration when 
supervisory positions open up.

Surpassing Goals
Building Goodwill
At some point, one of your employee’s actions in the company 
or in the community will generate major positive recognition 
for the company itself. Perhaps this employee will reach a 
particularly important landmark. Maybe he’ll head a highly 
successful fundraising effort. Or perhaps he’ll play a central 
role in spearheading company support for victims of a natural 
disaster.
Regardless of the specific achievement, your employee’s 
actions, leadership, or service will give the company’s reputa-
tion, stature, and image a significant boost. And when com-
pany goodwill gets a boost, the value of the company gets a 
boost as well.
When you have an employee who successfully engages in 
extraordinary behaviors that enhance goodwill — whether 
such actions are part of his job description or not — he 
clearly merits extraordinary recognition from you.
Surpassing Goals
As you work with your employees, monitor their progress, 
and provide them with coaching and guidance, you’ll find 
a select few who surpass their challenging performance 
goals or developmental goals. This achievement is one of 
the most revealing indicators of your employees’ work ethic, 
personal standards, and drive, and it’s clearly worthy of 
special recognition in the performance appraisal process.
Employees who surpass their goals know that they’ve done 
so, and they’re likely to sense high levels of personal satis-
faction, competence, and effectiveness as a result. You can 
elevate these positive feelings to even higher levels during 
the performance review by specifically recognizing your 
employees’ success in exceeding their challenging goals.
 
Some employees’ overall goals are to exceed their goals. The 
more special the recognition you provide for doing so, the 
more likely they are to continue their special goal-oriented 
performance.

 Chapter 19: The Top Ten Behaviors Meriting Special Recognition 329
Going the Extra Mile
Going the Extra Mile
As you review the broad range of behaviors displayed by your 
employees during the course of the evaluation period, be sure 
to look for steps that your employees have taken to do some-
thing extra to help their co-workers, customers, or the com-
pany at large. Often, these extra steps — large or small — make 
the difference between a good employee and a great employee, 
and, as such, they deserve special recognition.
Employees who go the extra mile are demonstrating an 
ongoing willingness to do whatever they can to help others, 
and they’re willing to do so with high-level assignments as 
well as with minor chores.
These kinds of supportive and dedicated behaviors by some 
of your employees not only reflect highly positive attitudes 
but also help build such attitudes among their co-workers. 
In light of the widespread positive impact associated with 
going the extra mile, you should go the extra mile yourself in 
providing extra recognition to these employees.
