Purpose 
This book contains a collection of games and activities for use in the maths 
classroom and provides opportunities for children to develop as learners in a 
wide variety of ways. They have all been tried and tested in my own classrooms 
over the years and shared with colleagues in KS1 and KS2. The activities are 
designed to introduce and reinforce mathematical concepts and can provide a 
rich source of ideas for achieving and consolidating many curricular objectives. 
	
At the heart of all the activities is active participation and collaborative 
learning. Each activity will help children improve their speaking and listening 
skills by interpreting, discussing, following rules, making decisions and asking 
questions. Playing the games and activities in this book will also help children to
●
●
use and extend their mathematical vocabulary
●
●
explore, express, discuss and argue mathematical ideas
●
●
think and work mathematically
●
●
build mathematical confidence
●
●
improve their concentration
●
●
develop positive attitudes towards maths
●
●
learn the value of talking mathematically and working together to achieve 
understanding 
●
●
experience maths in a thought-provoking and exciting environment
●
●
cultivate mathematical development by building and extending current 
knowledge and understanding 
●
●
freely explore a range of concepts, reinforcing and extending their skills.
Practical, hands-on and minds-on maths activities such as those contained in 
this resource will, over a relatively short space of time, help children to 
●
●
improve the efficiency of their mental calculations and extend informal pencil-
and-paper procedures
●
●
think creatively and have fun doing maths
●
●
work cooperatively and support each other
●
●
compete sensibly and play fair
●
●
record thinking in a variety of ways
●
●
devise new ways of working
●
●
discuss different strategies and approaches

Games and activities help children get a much better feel for what maths is all 
about, what it can do and how it does it. Games and activities help teachers see 
children in new contexts. They can help teachers get to grips with the levels of 
sophistication children are working at, talk through inconsistencies and respond 
to challenges. They help to inform assessment because pupils reveal what they 
know, what they don’t know and what they partly know. This makes next steps 
in learning more diagnostic and suited to the needs of learners. 
	
Sometimes, it is said that when children are involved in games they don’t 
really realise they are doing maths. That is not the intention of this book. We 
want children to recognise the maths they are using and make use of it in other 
situations. It is down to us to make the maths explicit if it isn’t already obvious 
to children and to further exploit maths opportunities whenever they arise. 
How to use this book
The games and activities can be used at the beginning of a lesson, as a main 
lesson focus, as part of a guided maths session or within the plenary. They could 
also be used outside a maths lesson. To get the most out of the activities, it is 
important to be clear about why you are using them. If you plan to use them just 
for fun then they could form a part of your reward system for completing work, 
used in a maths golden time or within a maths club. If your aim is to practise 
a key skill or process then you will use the activities more strategically as part 
of your planning linked to the concept you are pinpointing. Some games might 
be taken home as part of the homework policy too. You might use a game or 
activity as part of a display to stimulate discussion.
	
However you decide to use the book, each activity needs careful explanation 
so that children know what to do, although try to avoid long-winded instructions, 
as children will be keen to get started. It is hoped that the games and activities 
will be used regularly rather than just now and again. Although you and your 
class might have a favourite, it is important to introduce new games in order to 
build new skills.  
	
The games and activities have been designed to be as practical as possible 
using resources readily available in the classroom. You may, however, have to 
make specific provisions for children with special needs, e.g. enlarging text.    

­x
introduction
	
Many of the games are key stage specific, but they can be easily adapted to 
suit the needs of your learners. If you look at an activity and think it might not 
have a low enough access point, then it might require only a small modification 
to make it usable. When trying out the games and activities it is worth bearing 
in mind that you will find some that work really well with your class, some that 
work reasonably well whilst others might just fall flat. There is no such thing as 
a universally challenging activity where one size fits all. It is worth building up 
a file of all the games, activities and investigations that you use and annotating 
them with how they worked, any problems that arose and what you would 
do differently next time. The success of the games and activities will largely 
be down to the teacher and the extent to which dialogue and discussion are 
encouraged. Where possible, move between pairs/groups, listen for a while, 
intervene strategically and engage them by asking probing questions, provoking 
discussion and responding to answers (see appendices for types of thinking 
questions you could use).   
	
Children need to be challenged by activities that encourage them to think 
and talk about their ideas and it is hoped that this resource will play a part 
in establishing games and activities as a normal part of daily maths work 
stimulating junior maths brains.  
Page layout
Each activity comes with a brief description to give you a flavour of what the 
activity is about. The ‘Learning objectives’ are linked to the National Curriculum 
programmes of study and the New Framework. A ‘Resources’ section tells 
you what equipment you will need for the activity. ‘What to do’ describes 
the instructions for games or what steps you might choose to take within an 
activity. ‘Variations’ offers you some ideas for making tweaks and changes to the 
activity to adapt it in some way. ‘Challenge questions’ provide food for thought 
extensions to test you further.

Shuffle the number cards and place them face down in a pile on the 
table.
●
●
Players take it in turns to take a card and write the number in one of 
the empty spaces under the written number.
●
●
If you cannot place a number then the card is returned to the pile. 
●
●
The winner is the first player to fill in all the empty spaces.

­6
GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Challenge questions 
●
●
Discuss how fair the game would be to include a number with four digits that 
are the same. Could that person win? 
●
●
Can you invent a decimal version of this game?
●
●
Can you find the digital root of the number and then subtract this from your 
starting number? For example,
4102
4 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 7
4102 − 7 = 4095
●
●
Can you multiply each individual digit together to make a new number? 
For example, 7 × 5 × 7 × 8 = 1960. Does this make a larger or smaller 
number than the number you started with?

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
●
●
Variations 
●
●
You can play this game for numbers other than multiples of 10. 
●
●
Instead of placing a digit anywhere, start at 10 and work your way through 
to 90, so whatever digit you pick up has to go in one of the boxes next to the 
target number of 10.
●
●
Change the rules so that points are scored for getting within 5 of a target 
number.
●
●
Progress on to target numbers over 100.
●
●
Try this game for decimal numbers too. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
What does each digit represent in terms of its face and place value?
●
●
How many odd/even numbers did you make?
●

Points are scored as follows:
20 points for hitting the target and making the number exactly.
15 points for making a number two away, e.g. if the target number was 
10 and someone made either 08 or 12 then 15 points would be scored.
●
●
•The winner is the player who has the most points after all the boxes 
have been filled with digits.

●
Bish, bash, bosh guessing grid
What to do
●
●
Organise children into pairs and give out copies of the Bish, bash, bosh 
guessing grid.
●
●
One player picks two digit cards and makes a 2-digit number. The 
cards are turned over face down on the table.
●
●
Player 2 tries to guess the number written down using the guessing grid. 
●
●
The first player ticks in the correct column according to whether the 
number guessed is a bish, a bash or a bosh. For example, the bish 
column means that the guesser has one correct digit but in the wrong 
position. The bash column means the guesser has one correct digit 
in the correct position. The bosh column means that the guesser has 
nothing correct.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
	
Variations 
●
●
You can play this game using two sets of digit cards to make a 3-digit number.
●
●
If the player who is guessing hasn’t guessed their number after 12 attempts 
then they lose their go.
●
●
Points can be scored according to how quickly a number is guessed. For 
example, first guess correct = 100 points, 2–5 guesses = 30 points,  
6–10 guesses = 15 points and so on. 
●
●
The second player continues guessing until the correct number is guessed.

What to do
●
●
Randomly select any number using digit cards or rolling some dice. 
You can decide whether to focus on a single-digit number or higher but 
aim for a mixture of numbers through the week.
●
●
Now tell children that you are going to ask them a dozen questions 
relating to that number which they then have to work out. For example:

Tell the children that they don’t have to answer the questions in order. 
If they get stuck on one they move on to a question they can answer.
●
●
Work through ‘Number of the lesson’ together to familiarise children 
with the activity and share answers. Use the session to find out what 
children know and don’t know about number properties in order to plan 
future questions.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You can vary the questions depending on what you want to focus on. You can 
add more questions or just concentrate on a few and theme them if you wish. 
For example, you may want to ask questions for one week relating to factors, 
rounding, multiplying by 10 and dividing by 10.
●
●
You could select decimal numbers, fractions or negative numbers. Questions 
could be tailored accordingly. For example, ‘What is 1 less than the 
number?’, ‘Is the number greater than or smaller than 
2
7?’, etc.
●
●
Provide different table groups with the same number but different questions 
or different numbers and the same questions. 
●
●
Provide children with similar activities for homework. 
●
●
At the end of the week, revise the questions covered and assess children’s 
knowledge and understanding through a test. 
●
●
Have a head-to-head competition where children compete against each other 
to complete the number questions in the fastest time. 
Challenge questions 
●
●

●
Could you invent a similar game for practising greater than/less than in  
relation to fractions?
●
●
Rather than a 6 × 6 grid, what other arrangement could you use? 
●
●
If a player rolls a number and an equals sign then that number is 
covered, e.g. a 1 and = would mean 1 is covered.

Organise children into pairs and give them a copy of the number grid 
shown below.
●
●
Decide who will go first. Roll the three dice.
●
●
Now write down all the 3-digit numbers you can make with these three 
numbers. You cannot use a digit twice. For example, if you roll 1, 2 
and 3 then you can make 123, 132, 213, 231, 321, 312.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
Make the grid smaller such as a 8 x 8 and populate with different numbers.
●
●
Rather than make all the 3-digit numbers you can, make one 3-digit number.
●
●
If you throw a heads, lose your go. If you throw a tails then you can round to 
the nearest 10 or 100.
●
●
You could adapt this game for rounding to the nearest 1000. Play with four 
dice and change the numbers inside the board. 
●
●
You could play with different numbered dice. For example, you could try  
4–9 dice. 
●
●
Now toss a coin. If it lands on heads then round the 3-digit numbers 
you have made to the nearest 10. If it lands on tails then you round the 
3-digit numbers to the nearest 100. For example, if the coin landed on 
tails then 123 = 100, 132 = 100, 213 = 200, 231 = 200, 321 = 
300 and 312 = 300.
●
●
Now place a counter on each square which has a number you made. 
So in this example, you would put a counter on 100, 200 and 300.
●
●
The winner is the person with the most counters on the board after 
seven turns each.

PLACE VALUE
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent a version of the game with six dice? For example, you throw 
six dice and discard three to make 3-digit numbers.
●
●
Can you think of another way of selecting whether to round to the nearest 
10 and 100 other than tossing a coin? For example, you could throw one die 
and if you throw a 1, 2 or 3 then round to the nearest 10 and throw a 4, 5 
or 6 and round to the nearest 100. 
●
●
If you throw three dice, is it possible to make more than six 3-digit numbers?

PLACE VALUE
Variations 
●
●
Points can be scored differently. For example, instead of face value points, 
points can be equal to their place value and these added together at the end 
of the game.
●
●
Instead of rounding to one decimal place, round to two decimal places and score 
according to the decimal part of the number made. For example, if the digits 
selected are 7.628 then this would be rounded to 7.63 and 63 points scored. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you play this game where you round to three decimal places?
●
●
Can you invent a new scoring system? For example, what about saying that 
the first person to make 12 is the winner? 
●
●
Write an explanation of rounding for a maths dictionary and provide examples.
●
●
Shuffle the cards and place them on the table face down. 
●
●
One player then selects a card and both players then write that number 
inside one of the empty boxes on their number grid.
●
●
This is repeated three times until both players have filled their grids.
●
●
Players then round their number correct to one decimal place. For 
example, if the digits selected are 3.469 then this would be rounded 
up to 3.5 and 5 points would be scored. 
●
●
Points are scored according to the face value of the tenths digit.
●
●
Play ten times.

The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the ten 
rounds.

The numbers on the number pavements could be changed. For example, if 
you used 4–9 dice then you could use numbers from 8 to 18. 
●
●
The player to get four counters across the road could be the winner. 
●
●
If you get a counter across the road then you get another go.
●
●
If you get a counter across the road, it turns into the same coloured counter 
as your opponent and it can be placed next to any number on their number 
pavement. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you adapt this game to practise multiplication? For example, could you 
replace the numbers 1–12 with 1–36? 
●
●
How fair would it be to only have 12 numbers in this game? Would you need 
to make the number pavements longer?
●
●
Now throw two dice and add them together. If the total is equal to a 
number where you have placed a counter then that counter can cross 
over the road. Only one counter can move if you have placed more 
than one on a number.

Focus on the names of animals and see who has the largest total. 
●
●
Use a calculator for those children who experience difficulty.   
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you think of ways of assigning different values to the letters of the  
alphabet? Why not give them a monetary value? You could give the 
vowels one value and the consonants another, such as vowels are 7p and 
consonants are 3p. Set a puzzle based on this. For example, if BANANA = 
30p and APPLE = 23p, what does a STRAWBERRY cost?
●
●
If you give vowels and consonants different values, provide the words but  
not the value. Challenge groups to work out how much the vowels and  
consonants are actually worth. For example, if ZEBRA = 36p,  
ELEPHANT = 57p, then how much is a WASP? (Answer = 27p as vowels 
are worth 9p and consonants are worth 6p)

●
Rather than jumble all the numbers, these could be placed in order starting 
with the smallest in the bottom left corner. 
●
●
Play the game without the option of placing two counters on individual  
numbers thrown on the dice – the numbers have to be added.
Challenge question
●
●
Can you invent a different set of rules? For example, points are scored 
according to the numbers covered. If you make three in a row and one of 
your numbers is a square number then double your total.
●
●
Both players roll the dice. Highest number starts.
●
●
The first player rolls the dice. The player is allowed to place counters

●
Mix and match the operations. For example, you can decide to add or  
multiply when it is your throw.
●
●
Dice numbers don’t have to be 1–6. Relabel the faces with sticky labels with 
other numbers, e.g. you could have a prime number die made up of 2, 3, 5, 
7, 11, 13 and a composite number die made up of 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36.   
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you think of a way of making the game more demanding? For example, 
the aim of the game could be to reach a target number in the fewest number 
of throws or the target number has to be reached exactly.
●
●
Is there a penalty rule that would make the game riskier to play? For  
example, if you throw a double 1 you lose the whole of your score.

A set of dominoes
What to do
●
●
Place a set of dominoes upside down on the table and shuffle them. 
●
●
Each player takes three dominoes and turns them over.  
●
●
Players now look at each domino to make three 2-digit numbers. Each 
domino can be treated as two 2-digit numbers (except for doubles). So, 
a domino with one spot and three spots could make 13 or 31.
●
●
The aim of the game is to add the dominoes together to make 100 or 
as close to 100 as possible. For example, 46 + 24 + 31 = 101.
●
●
If a player makes an addition that equals exactly 100 then 100 points 
are scored. If a player can make a number 5 away from 100 then  
20 points are scored. Any other number and no points are scored. 
●
●
Keep playing the game until all the dominoes run out.
●
●
The player with the most points after all the dominoes have been used 
is the winner.

Aims
●
●
To add 2-digit numbers.
●
●
To use and understand less than < and greater than > signs in order to win 
a game. 
Players
●
●
This game is best played in pairs

What to do
●
●
Get children to draw some empty addition and answer boxes on a 
piece of paper or on a whiteboard. 
●
●
Children take it in turns to roll a die 8 times (4 times each).
●
●
After each roll players write down the number shown on the die in one 
of the boxes on their sheet or whiteboard.   
●
●
Tell children that after a number is written in a box it may not be 
changed.  
●
●
Children now find the two sums.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You could add 3-digit numbers together and vary the number of rolls of the die. 
●
●
Adapt the points system, e.g. for an addition answer that is made up of prime 
numbers score 20 points.    
●
●
Instead of having a 1–6 die, place sticky labels over the spots and relabel 
from 4 to 9.  
●
●
Round each answer to the nearest 100.
Challenge questions 
●
●
Does it make a difference where you place digits higher than 5?
●
●
Are any of the addition sums multiples of 6? 7? 8? 9? What are the rules for 
divisibility for these numbers? 
●
●
If the number sentences about the sums are correct and 
both sums are 3-digit numbers = 10 points
both sums are 2-digit numbers = 8 points
only the larger sum is a 3-digit number = 4 points
otherwise = 0 points
●
●
Play the game three or four times. The player with the most points is 
the winner.

●
Rather than use three cards, you could use more and investigate larger numbers.
●
●
If a number is not palindromic, repeat the process. For example, if you deal 
1, 5 and 4, reverse the digits and add, you make 605. Rather than stop 
there, now reverse 605 and add. Does this make a palindromic number? 
Challenge question
●
●
Take some palindromic numbers. Can you always make them by adding a 
number and its reverse?
●
●
What are the first 20 palindromic numbers? (Answer 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66,

In order is a game to help children subtract decimal 
numbers with two decimal places.
What to do
●
●
Write three numbers on the board and place a decimal point between 
them. For example, 7.45
●
●
Now roll a die three times. Explain that your first throw gives the 
number of hundredths, your second throw gives the number of tenths 
and the third throw gives the number of units. 
●
●
For example, if you throw 351 then the number made will be 1.53 
This number is then subtracted from 7.45 to make 5.92
●
●
This can be practised a few more times so that children get familiar 
with the game.
●
●
Now write some decimal numbers on the board which children will use 
to subtract from: 8.99, 5.28, 4.01, 2.56, etc.
●
●
Players then take it in turns to subtract their die rolls from the numbers 
on the board. 
●
●
The first player to make a total of more than 20 is the winner.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You could play this game with decimal numbers with just one decimal place 
and two throws of the die. 
●
●
Play with tens, units and tenths.
●
●
Play with a 4–9 die instead (this may mean that you have to swap the top 
number and bottom number over in order to subtract them).
●
●
The first player to make 50 is the winner. 
●
●
When you have worked out your subtraction, your answer becomes the new 
number to start with. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you read the numbers you have made? 
●
●
Can you round the numbers to the nearest tenth? hundredth? 
●
●
Can you reverse the digits to make a new subtraction? Does this make a 
bigger or smaller number?

Pencil and paper
Take it away is a game to help children subtract a 3-digit 
whole number from a 4-digit whole number.
What to do
●
●
Explain what to do with the whole class first. Write the following number 
on the board and ask children to write it on their paper: 7922.
●
●
Now ask children to roll three dice to make a 3-digit number.
●
●
Challenge the class to identify the types of number thrown. For  
example, if 3, 4, 5 are thrown then 3 = a prime number, 4 = a  
composite number, 5 = a prime number.
●
●
Players now subtract the 3-digit number from 7922 using a pencil and 
paper method to get 7577. The digital root of this number is then the 
score. So, 7 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 26, 2 + 6 = 8, so 8 is scored.  
●
●
Now write some 4-digit numbers on the board for children to work 
with: 8654, 9023, 1352, 6767, 5499, 8921, etc.
●
●
The player with the highest score after 9 turns is the winner.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
Players make as many 3-digit numbers as they can with the dice thrown and 
subtract this from the 4-digit number. 
●
●
Players could throw two dice and subtract from a 3-digit number or throw 
one die and subtract from a 2-digit number. 
●
●
Rather than find the digital root, players could be awarded points if their 
answer is even, odd, contains three prime numbers, etc.       
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you think of another way to generate the starting numbers? For example, 
using a 0–9 spinner. 
●
●
Can you make the game more challenging? For example, what about using  
5- or 6-digit numbers to subtract from?
●
●
How many different ways could you subtract? Use more than one method 
and compare them.

Challenge questions 
●
●
What do you notice about dominoes that are doubles? Is it fair to include 
these numbers?
●
●
Is there anything you notice about the differences? Do they make even  
numbers? odd numbers? both?  
●
●
Could you turn this into a fraction game? For example, take two dominoes 
and use the dots to make fractions. So, 2 dots and 5 dots would make 2–

Challenge questions
●
●
When the aim of the game is to make the smallest possible difference, do 
you have to make two large numbers and then subtract them or two small 
numbers and then subtract them?
●
●
Can you invent bonus points for the game? For example, if the difference is 
divisible by 6 then score an extra 50 points.
●
●
Can you invent any penalty point rules? For example, if your difference 
contains any prime numbers then score 20 points less per prime.  
Player 2 receives 9,4,8,5,6,2,6,7,1,2
Highest number = 98,766
Lowest number = 12,245
Difference = 86,521
Player 2 is the winner by 1,099.

Can you think of a way of making 18 numbers for the Number roll strip? For 
example, these can be made by dealing out 0–9 digit cards in order to make 
the numbers.
●
●
When you have made 18 numbers, can you subtract the numbers from each 
other to ensure the number board is filled? Are there enough numbers to fill 
the board? Are there too many? If there are, what is the fairest way of not

0–9 digit cards 
Big difference is a subtraction game that helps children 
to practise subtracting decimal numbers with up to three 
decimal places.
What to do
M
M
Each pair or group gets two sets of 0–9 digit cards.
M
M
Shuffle the cards. Players take it in turns to take six digit cards and 
then make two decimal numbers with two decimal places. For  
example, 6.32 and 5.69
M
M
The smaller decimal number is subtracted from the larger.
M
M
The digits of the answer are then added together in order to find the 
digital root. Remind children that, to find the digital root, add the 
digits, then add the digits of the total until you reach a 1-digit number. 
So, in the example above, 6.32 – 5.69 = 0.63 
The digital root of 0.63 is 0 + 6 + 3 = 9, so 9 points are scored. 
M
M
Play continues like this until everyone has had three turns each. The 
winner is the player who has scored most points.

This game can be played for any multiplication table. Try the game for 3  
and 4, 7 and 8, 8 and 9 etc., remembering to generate new numbers for the 
number board.
●
●
The winner is the player to cover the most numbers. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
If you play three in a row to win, can you multiply the numbers you have 
covered together?
●
●
Can you invent your own version of this game for 9 and 12? 
●
●
Players have a die each.
●
●
Player A rolls the die and multiplies their score by 6 and covers an 
answer on the board.
●
●
Player B rolls the die and multiplies their score by 7 and covers an 
answer on the board.

●
●
Give children a copy of the number grid, one between two.
●
●
Take turns to throw the three dice. 
●
●
The two 1–6 dice are added together and then multiplied by the 6–11 die.
●
●
If the result matches a number on the number grid then cover that 
number with a coloured counter.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
The number grid could be made bigger or smaller depending on the ability of 
the children. 
●
●
The numbers could be congregated differently with more repeats of particular 
numbers. For example, you might decide to include 42 six times and 64 only 
once. 
●
●
Rather than four in a row you could say four numbers in any column – again, 
they don’t have to be joined. 
●
●
Play continues until both players have covered eight squares and then  
players add up the numbers under the counters to get a total score. The 
player with the most points is the winner.  
Challenge question
●
●
Can you think about using a die in another way? For example, could you use 
four 1–6 dice – what changes would you make to the rules and what changes 
would you need to make to the number grid? 
●
●
Keep a record of how you made the number each time for someone 
else to check.
●
●
The winner is the first player to have four counters in any one row (they 
do not have to be joined).

Players

Resources
●
●
A pack of playing cards or a couple of sets of 0–12 digit cards
I spy is a fast ‘think on your feet’ multiplication game to 
help children with their mental agility when finding products.
What to do
●
●
Shuffle a pack of 52 playing cards, leaving in all picture cards and 
jokers.
●
●
Organise children into threes. One player is the spy and the other two 
compete against each other.
●
●
Place the playing cards face up in 7 rows and 7 columns. Cards left 
over place to one side. 
●
●
One player acts as the spy by calling out products. For example, ‘I spy 
with my maths eye 24.’
●
●
The other two players search for two numbers that make the number 
called. 
▼

­136
GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
Use a smaller grid size.
●
●
This could be played as a game of I spy division where the spy calls out a 
division sum, ‘I spy with my maths eye 7.’ This game would require number 
digit cards larger than those used for the multiplication game.
●
●
Rather than have a rule where numbers have to be next to each other, 
players can point to numbers anywhere on the grid and take them if they 
multiply together to make the product called.  
●
●
You could call out two products at a time for players to find. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you think of different ways of saying the products? For example, ‘I spy 
with my maths eye 6 squared.’
●
●
Can you think of a way of scoring other than collecting the most cards? For 
example, adding up the scores printed on the cards. 
●
●
The numbers have to be next to each other either horizontally,  
vertically or diagonally.
●
●
Players put up their hand if they find two numbers that make the  
product called, point to them and take the cards from the 8 x 8 grid if 
everyone agrees that the numbers have been multiplied together correctly. 
●
●
A joker can stand for any number and picture cards equal 10. An ace 
makes 1 or 11.
●
●
Play continues like this and, as more cards are removed, the spy 
moves the remaining cards closer together so there are no gaps. 
●
●
The winner is the player with the most cards at the end of the game.
●
●
Play a new game and take turns being the maths spy who calls out the 
products.

●
Continue taking turns rolling the die and filling the grid with trebled 
numbers until the grid is full.
●
●
Now take turns to roll the die again. Treble your answer and place a 
coloured counter on the number you have made.
●
●
The winner is the first player to get four in a row, vertically,  
horizontally or diagonally.

●
Award bonus points for particular squares. For example, if you cover a square 
in any of the corners, then have another go.  
Challenge questions

Is this game fair? Is there a fair way of starting other than rolling a die or 
tossing a coin? 
●
●
How could you vary the rules? Could you use two dice?

What to do
●
●
Ask children to think about how many ‘eyes’ there are in the class. 
Work this out together. Now ask children to work out how many  
fingers and toes there are in the class. Calculate the answer together. 
●
●
Now encourage children to think about other animals apart from 
themselves. For example, if there are 239 chickens how many wings 
is that? 
●
●
Now show children the following list and ask them to work out the 
solution to each one:

Increase or decrease the number of animals as appropriate. 
●
●
Join some problems together. For example, 29 chickens, 39 dragonflies and 
115 seagulls – how many wings? 
●
●
Think about some number prefixes and ask children questions based on 
these. For example, how many legs do 3,786 tripods have? How many 
babies would 4,599 sets of triplets be? How many sets of quadruplets would 
1,800 be?  
Challenge questions 
●
●
Are there any creatures with more than 8 legs?
●
●
How many number prefixes do you know? What do they mean? For example,  
pentathlon, heptathlon, decathlon.  
●
●
Read the following rhyme and then work out how many people and animals 
were going to St Ives.
As I was going to St Ives,
I met a man with seven wives,
Every wife had seven sacks,
Every sack had seven cats,
Every cat had seven kits.
193 octopuses – how many arms?
226 spiders – how many legs?
378 ladybirds – how many legs?
949 dragonflies – how many wings?
898 scorpions – how many legs?
1,063 flies – how many legs?
●
●
Go through the answers together and tell children that a ladybird has 6 
legs, a dragonfly has 4 wings, and a scorpion has 8 legs. Do they need 
to recalculate their answers?
●
●
Ask children to invent their own number problems like this based on 
other animals.

(Answer: Since the narrator is going to St Ives, the other folks (and their 
possessions) are coming from St Ives, So, the narrator is the only one going 
to St Ives. The puzzle specifies kittens, cats, sacks and wives. The narrator 
may or may not be a wife, so the answer is zero or one. This aside, there are 
7 wives (maybe 8 if the narrator is a wife), 49 sacks, 343 cats and 2,401 
kittens. The total is 2,800, or 2,801 if the narrator is a wife.)

What to do
●
●
Give each pair a set of 1–9 digit cards.
●
●
Players shuffle the cards and then take two to make a 2-digit number. 
For example, 59.
●
●
Players then find the digital root of this number. For example,  
5 + 9 = 14, 1 + 4 = 5.
●
●
When the digital root has been found, players then divide 59 by this 
number. So, 59 ÷ 5 = 11 remainder 4 or remainder 
4
5.

You can use a different die (4–9).
●
●
Include two snakes each containing a different set of numbers so each player 
has their own snake. 
●
●
Play to reach the head of the snake rather than there and back again.
●
●
Convert the remainders into fractions and add the fractions together.   
●
●
If you throw two 6s in succession then take off all your points.  
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent a game like this but as a race track instead of a snake? What 
rules would you change/add?  
●
●
How can the game be improved? For example, could you invent a version of 
snakes and ladders where the numbers used are those from 1 to 100 rather 
than those printed on the snake? Could you play it whereby you go down a 
ladder and up an adder (the snake)?   
●
●
Start on the tail of the snake. Roll the die and move your counter that 
number of spaces forward.
●
●
Now divide the number you land on by the number on the die. For 
example, if you throw a 3 and then land on 37, you divide 37 by 3 
then you get 12 remainder 1. One point would be scored because this 
is the remainder. 
●
●
Play continues up to the head of the snake and back down to the tail.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You can invent different grids for different table groups containing different 
numbers and then compare and contrast answers. 
●
●
Try this activity for other numbers. For example, try circling numbers which 
are divisible by 3, 6 and 9.  
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you write down other numbers which are also divisible by 2, 4 and 5?
●
●
Can you find all the factors of the numbers you have circled? 
●
●
Can you add up all the numbers in a row and then see whether the total divides 
by 2, 4 and 5? Do the same for the column totals and diagonals as well.
●
●
What am I? I am divisible by 3. My units digit is three times my tens 
digit. (Answer = 39)
●
●
What am I? I am divisible by 1 and myself. I live on the third row. 
(Answer = 17)
●
●
What am I? I am divisible by 1 and myself. I live in the first column 
and I am greater than 2 score. (Answer = 43)
●
●
What am I? I am divisible by 19 exactly but not by 3. I am the sum of 
the squares of the first three primes. (Answer = 38)
●
●
Ask children to work together to double-check their understanding. 
Circle all the numbers which are divisible by 4 in green. Circle all the 
numbers divisible by 5 in red and circle all the numbers divisible by 2 
in blue. 
●
●
Remind children that some numbers may be circled more than once. 
●
●
Now challenge children to complete the following number sentences: 
all numbers divisible by 4 are also divisible by______, a number  
divisible by 2 and 5 is also divisible by_____, a number divisible by 2, 
4 and 5 is also divisible by______.

Fishing line is a fun activity to help children improve their 
division skills.
What to do
●
●
Organise children into pairs and give them a copy of the Fishing line 
number grid shown below.
●
●
Explain to players that the aim of the game is to cover four numbers on 
the board.
●
●
To do this players roll a die and then select a number on the grid that 
will divide exactly. For example, if you threw a 4 then 16 could be 
covered because this divides four times exactly. 
●
●
Remind children that remainders are not allowed and that a number 
has to be exactly divisible.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You can include some higher numbers or increase the grid size.
●
●
Score the number that you cover. This would allow remainders to be played. 
For example, if you rolled a 3 and you selected 22, then this would be 7 
remainder 1. The remainder would then be subtracted from 22 giving a score 
of 21. It could be a better strategy to aim for numbers with a remainder if the 
number is a high number.
●
●
Play where the winner is the player to get a counter in each column.
Challenge question
●
●
Can you vary the game to provide an element of luck? For example, rather 
than choose any number on the board, the die is rolled twice. Once to say 
which number column you have to select a number from and once more to 
show what number you will use to divide by.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
 Variations 
●
●
You can play this game with counters instead of points and give each counter 
a monetary value. For example, each counter is worth 20p.  
●
●
Play the game with a different die, e.g. 4–9.
●
●
Make just one 2-digit number rather than two. For example, make the 
smallest number or the largest number.
●
●
Take it in turns to make a 3-digit number, a 4-digit number, etc.
●
●
If you throw a 1, then score 6 points. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you express the remainders as a fraction? For example, 24 ÷ 5 = 4 and 
4/5
●
●
Can you invent a similar game involving more than one die?
●
●
Can you write remainders as fractions and decimals? For example,  
31 ÷ 4 = 7 remainder 3 or 73
4 or 7.75. Try the following:
41 ÷ 3
27 ÷ 5
58 ÷ 8
46 ÷ 3
66 ÷ 7
	
Now invent some of your own for someone else to try.
●
●
Divide the numbers by the number rolled. If there is a remainder then 
score that number of points. For example, if you rolled a 3 then no 
points would be scored. If you rolled a 5 then 6 points would be scored 
because 24 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 4 and 42 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 2.

and three empty squares in the middle of the hexagon.
●
●
Players take three cards from a well-shuffled pack of digit cards and 
place them in the middle of the hexagon.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
You can alter the shape perhaps to a square, a pentagon, a heptagon or  
octagon. The numbers in each corner of the shapes chosen can then be 
altered accordingly.
●
●
Points could be scored differently. Instead of looking for numbers that are 
exactly divisible by the numbers in each corner, work out what the quotients 
are and round to the nearest whole. 
●
●
To help children, list divisibility tests on the board or print them off as a 
helpline for children to refer to. For example, 
  2 = the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6 or 8).
  3 = the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. 
  4 = the last two digits are divisible by 4.
  5 = the last digit is 0 or 5.
  6 = it is divisible by 2 and by 3.
  7 = subtract 2 times the last digit from the rest.
  8 = last 3 digits divisible by 8.
  9 = sum of digits divisible by 9.
10 = the last digit is 0.
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you make a poster of the divisibility tests to help other children?
●
●
Can you find the divisibility tests for 10, 11 and 12?
●
●
Work out whether 225 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  
For example,
225 is not divisible by 2 since the last digit is not 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.
225 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits is 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. 
225 is not divisible by 4 since 25 is not divisible by 4.
225 is divisible by 5 since the last digit is 5.
225 is not divisible by 6 since it is not divisible by both 2 and 3. 
●
●
Points are awarded according to the division made. For example, if the 
digits 3, 4 and 2 were chosen then 6 would divide into this  
scoring 57 points (342 ÷ 6 = 57) and 38 points for 342 ÷ 9 = 38. 
This would give a total of 57 and 38 = 95.

Explain to children that the challenge is to work out how old each child 
is. Explain that you have some clues to help them. 
●
●
Begin with the first clue: ‘Eddie is three years younger than Mia.’ 
●
●
Talk about this statement and show children how the table can be 
partially filled in using this clue. Say that you will use Y for Yes and N 
for No and fill in the table as follows:

Aims
●
●
To identify a mystery number through deduction and a process of elimination.

Paper and pencils (or whiteboards and pens)
Bings and bangs is a number detective game involving 
code-breaking and mathematical reasoning.
What to do
●
●
Player A thinks of a 4-digit number, for example 1863, and writes it 
down. The digits all have to be different. 
●
●
Player B then guesses what this secret number might be by saying any 
4-digit number, for example 8962. 
●
●
Player A reveals how close this guess is by saying how many bings 
and bangs have been scored. A bing means that the guess contains a 
correct digit but in the wrong position. A bang means that the guess 
contains a correct digit in the right position. So 8962 would be 1 bing 
and 1 bang. 
●
●
Player B uses this information to guess again with Player A revealing 
how many bings and bangs are scored.

LOGICAL REASONING
Variations 
●
●
Try playing with 5 or 6 digits instead of 4 (or fewer for younger or less  
confident learners) and work out the minimum number of moves needed 
to win.

Abi, Josh, Cary and Dexter each went to the shopping centre with the 
money they had saved. They each had a different amount of money. 
Each person only spent a fraction of the money they started out with. 
They started out with: £8, £24, £64 and £32. At the shopping centre 
one spent 1
4 of their money, one spent 1

Set two problems for the children to solve:  
How much money did each person spend? 
How much money does each person have left?

Read the following clues out for children to work with:
Cary has £56 left after spending money at the shops.
The person that started out with £8, has £2 left after shopping.
Josh did not spend 
3

●
●
After a period of working, take any feedback from children and discuss 
any issues arising from the problem. 
●
●
Work through the fractional amounts with children as appropriate and 
share the solution step by step as follows: 
Solution: Josh had £24 before going shopping. He spent 
1
4 of the 
money at the shops because he didn’t spend 
3
4 of his money. 
Josh has £18 left.
Dexter had £32 before going shopping because only one amount when 
halved would make 16 and that is 32. So, if Dexter spent 
1
2 of the 
money at the shops he still has £16.
Abi had £8 before going shopping. We know she had £2 left which 
means she spent 
3
4 of her money since £2 = 1
4 x 8.
Cary had £64 before going shopping. Cary spent 
1
8 of the money at the 
shops.
Cary still has £56.

●
Is the month relevant to helping solve the problem? Can you include  
superfluous information within the clues already provided?
Try to work out how many football stickers each person collected in 
May and June using the following clues:  
If Trey did not collect stickers in May then Tommy would only have  
47 stickers.
Nooria was not the one who collected 21 stickers in May.
Trey collected 24 more stickers in June than in May.
Eve has a total of 85 stickers.

What a card is a great number mind-reading trick which 
uses quite simple numbers to produce impressive results.
What to do
●
●
Write the following rows of numbers on the board: 
Line A      1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 
Line B      2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19 22 23 26 27 30 31 
Line C      4 5 6 7 12 13 14 15 20 21 22 23 28 29 30 31 
Line D      8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 
Line E      16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 
●
●
Ask children to look at the numbers carefully. Now ask someone to 
select a number that appears on one of the lines but they shouldn’t tell 
you what it is.
●
●
Ask the pupil selecting the number to say which lines the number 
appears on. 
▼

221
number tricks
Variations 
●
●
Let children perform the trick with a friend before trying it with a group. 
●
●
Use the number lines to find the range.
●
●
Use the number line for number recognition purposes. For example, what 
number am I? I am a number in line A. Both my digits are prime and my  
digital root is 6.   
Challenge questions 
●
●
How can the trick go wrong?
●
●
Will the trick always work?
●
●
What connection can you find between the number lines? Do they all add up 
to make the same sum? Why do they all end in 31? 
●
●
Why doesn’t the trick work if you look at the end of the number lines and 
add? Why must you always look at the beginning of the lines and add to 
reveal the number thought of?
●
●
Can you add a new line to the trick? What numbers would you include?  
Does it work? 
●
●
When you are told the lines that the number appears on you will be 
able to ‘read their mind’ and say what the number was. For example, 
let’s say that the number 5 was chosen. The pupil would say ‘My 
number appears on lines A and C. Without hesitation you are able to 
say, ‘I think your number is 5.’
●
●
Have a few more demonstrations of your number powers and then ask 
children to work out how they think you might do the trick.
●
●
Reveal to the children that the trick is to always look at the starting  
numbers on each line to work out the number thought of. So, if the 
pupil chose 5 and said it was on lines A and C then you would need to 
look at the beginning of line A (1) and the beginning of line C (4) and 
add these two numbers together.

Resources
●
●
Pencil and paper
Eleven’s heaven is a wonderful trick for multiplying by 11.
What to do
●
●
Tell children that multiplying by 11 is the easiest 2-digit number to 
multiply by because your answer will always begin and end with the 
same numbers as the one you’re multiplying by 11. For example, 11 x 
14 = 154.
●
●
Demonstrate how the trick works using the following example, 
Separate the two digits in your mind (1__4). 
Notice the hole between them! 
Add the 1 and the 4 together (1 + 4 = 5) 
Put the resulting 5 in the hole 154. That’s it! 11 x 14 = 154 
●
●
Demonstrate with another example: 11 x 25 = 275. How? Separate 
the 2 and 5 making sure to leave a space between them. Now add 2 
and 5 to make 7. Place the 7 in the gap and you get 275.
●
●
Let children try a couple by themselves, e.g. 11 x 32, 11 x 45.

Challenge questions 
●
●
Does this trick work for any other number apart from x11? Try the trick for 
other numbers such as x12, x22, etc.
●
●
Does this trick work for 3-digit numbers? For example, 11 x 321. Would this 
achieve a correct answer?  
●
●
Write 11 x 58 on the board and ask them to try the trick they have just 
learnt using this method. Does it work? Explain why 5138 cannot be 
the correct answer. Now show what to do:
If the result of the addition is greater than 9, you only put the ‘ones’ 
digit in the gap and carry the ‘tens’ digit from the addition. For 
example 11 x 58 ... 5__8 ... 5 + 8 = 13. Put the 3 in the space 
between the 5 and the 8. Now add the 1 from the 13 to the 5 to make 
6. Your answer is 638.

Another variation of this trick works as follows:
1.	Write down two numbers one less than 10 and one more than 10,  
e.g. 7 and 16.
2.	Multiply the second number by 10 (160).
3.	Multiply the first number by 9 (63).
4.	Subtract the two resulting numbers (97).
5.	You can now reveal the two numbers – the units digit is 7 and the larger 
than 10 number is 9 + 7 = 16).
Challenge questions 
●
●
Why does one number always have to be under 10?
●
●
Will this trick work for any number over 10? What about numbers over 99? 
●
●
Tell children that you will be able to tell what their original numbers 
were. In order to do this you add 1 to the result (457) – the units digit 
represents the smaller number. To work out the number more than ten 
subtract 7 from 45 to get 38.
●
●
Talk through the example and do the same for two other numbers to 
see how the trick works.
●
●
Children then try the trick for themselves using their own numbers.

Catch-22 is a very clever number trick that involves 
combining 2-digit numbers, adding and dividing skills.
What to do
●
●
Tell children that you have a number written inside an envelope that 
you think will match a number that someone in the class will have 
after they have followed some simple instructions.
●
●
Tell everyone to follow these steps:
Write down any three numbers less than 10. For example, 2, 5 and 8.
Now make all the six possible 2-digit numbers using these numbers: 
25, 28, 52, 58, 82, 85.
Now add them together (330).
Find the sum of the original three numbers (2 + 5 + 8 = 15).
Divide the first sum by the second (330 ÷ 15).

Try this trick to make the number 23 by following these steps: 
Write down any 3 digits e.g. 373
Add 25 (398)
Multiply by 2 (796)
Subtract 4 (792)
Divide by 2 (396)
Subtract your original number (23) 
Challenge question
●
●
Could you make this trick work for six possible 3-digit numbers? For example, 
if you chose 3, 6 and 7 then you could make 367, 376, 763, 736, 637 and 
673. Adding these together would make 3552. If you add 3, 6 and 7 you get 
16. Then 3552 divided by 16 makes 222.
●
●
Get everyone to keep their number as secret as possible.
●
●
Now ask everyone to write down their number on their whiteboard.
●
●
Open up the envelope to reveal the number 22.

Two little ducks is a very clever number trick that 
combines addition and division of 2-digit numbers.
What to do
●
●
Ask children to write down any 3-digit number in which the digits are 
all different, for example 123.
●
●
Get them to show you on their whiteboards. 
●
●
Now ask children to write down all the possible 2-digit combinations of 
the three digits used and add them together. So 123 would make  
12 + 13 + 23 + 21 + 31 + 32 = 132.
●
●
Point out to children that when adding the digits there should always 
be six possibilities – can they work out why?
●
●
Now add the digits in the original number chosen. For example,  
1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Roll a 1–6 dice or a 4–9 dice three times to make a 3-digit number.
●
●
Try this trick with a 3-digit number in which one of the digits appears twice, 
e.g. 454. How many combinations of 2-digit numbers are possible? Does this 
end in 22?  
Challenge questions 
●
●
Will this trick work for any 3-digit number? What happens if the digits  
are all the same? 
●
●
What happens if one of the three digits is a zero? 
●
●
Can you make this trick work for a four-digit number?  
●
●
Now divide the sum of the 2-digit numbers (132) by the sum of the 
digits in the original number (6). So 132 ÷ 6 = 22.

confidently that the bottom numbers are 5, 2, 4, 6 and 5 and that the 
total of these numbers is 22. 
●
●
Explain to the class your secret! Say that on any 1–6 die, the sum of 
the top number and the bottom number is always 7. So, if five dice are 
thrown then the total of all the top and bottom numbers is 35.

Would this game work for dice that have more than six sides? Investigate  
different dice and find out. The cube belongs to the five Platonic solids. What 
are these shapes called?
●
●
What do the numbers on a 1–6 die add up to? Why do the top and bottom 
numbers add up to 7? 
●
●
Is there a necessity for the opposite sides of a die to all add to 7? As long as 
the numbers are all present the die would still be fair and proper, and the 
probability of rolling any particular number would be 1
6.
●
●
One player in the pair throws five dice and then says what the  
numbers are underneath each die. This player’s partner can turn  
them over and check. 
●
●
Players take it in turns throwing the dice, saying what numbers are 
underneath and adding them together. The total of the bottom  
numbers is the number of points scored for that round.

●
Provide the answer of 427,572 within seconds.
●
●
Share with children the ‘secret’ to this trick as follows:
The first 3 digits of the answer are 428 − 1 = 427.

Ask the person selecting the number to see if the number they have 
chosen also appears on any of the other number boards.
●
●
Ask your volunteer to point to the number boards that their number 
appears on. Again, the chosen number cannot be revealed. For  
example, they may point to boards 1, 3 and 4.
●
●
Tell the class that you will read the mind of the volunteer and write 
down on a whiteboard the number that person has selected. If they 
have selected boards 1, 3 and 4, you can confidently reveal that their 
number is 11.
●
●
Repeat this trick a few times to wow your audience and then reveal the 
trick.
●
●
The trick works like this: for each of the boards pointed to, all you have 
to do is add the numbers that appear in the top right corner.

Number head number grid 
Number head is an amazing ‘mind-reading’ trick that will 
impress any audience. This stunning trick involves some basic 
maths and can be learnt with practice by a range of learners.
What to do
●
●
Give children a copy of the Number head grid shown below.
●
●
Tell everyone that you have memorised every single number on the 
board and that you’d like to challenge someone.
●
●
Ask for a volunteer to select a number in bold and say that you will 
write down the number that appears underneath it. For example, if 
they select 5, confidently write down 6178538.
●
●
Repeat this a few times to prove that luck isn’t involved.

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
●
●
Build tension into your performance by slowing down the way you 
recite and write numbers.
●
●
Challenge the class to work out how the number trick works. Take 
feedback from groups and see what they suggest.
●
●
Reveal the method behind the trick as follows
1.	Add 11 to the number selected
2.	Reverse the result
3.	Keep on adding the two previous numbers leaving out the 10s
4.	Say the number.
For example, if 1 was selected, add 11 to get 12. Reverse 12 to get 
21. Now add 2 and 1 to get 3, 1 and 3 to get 4, 3 and 4 to get 7, 4 
and 7 to get 11 (but ignore the 10 – just write down 1), add 7 and 1 
to get 8. The number is 2134718.   
If 5 is chosen, then add 11 to make 16. Now reverse the digits to 
make 61. Then add 6 and 1 to get 7, 7 and 1 to get 8, 8 and 7 to 
get 15 but ignore the ten part of 15. Now add 8 and 5 to get 13 and 
ignore the 10. Finally add 5 and 3 to get 8. The number is 6178538.

number tricks
Variations 
●
●
Instead of using the whole number board, which may be too much for some 
learners to look at, cut out just the first row of numbers and focus on these.
●
●
Use the number board to practise other skills, e.g. look at the number that 
appears under 30, now say that number. Reverse the digits and say the 
number you have made. Add the digits and multiply it by 30. How many 
numbers underneath 30 are factors of 30? How many square numbers can 
you see underneath 30? Which number in the row of numbers under 30 is 
the odd one out? Write the long number in words. Can you place the commas 
in the long number?
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent a row of numbers to join the number board? Think of a 
number and then follow the method above to make the number underneath. 
●
●
What is the name given to the number sequence whereby neighbouring  
numbers are added to each other in this way?
●
●
If someone read the long number out, could you say what the number above 
it was?
●
●
Can you invent your own number board and use another rule?
●
●
The long number has seven digits. Can you make a number with nine digits 
every time?

●
The questions can be tailored according to the groups you are teaching to 
make them more or less demanding.  
●
●
You could add a fourth row to your bingo card. 
●
●
Children could play with more than one card. 
●
●
Children make up the next question if they answer correctly. 
●
●
Number ranges could be changed, e.g. 1–15, 16–30 and so on. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent your own questions for the Bingo-bingo game?  
●
●
Can you include bonus numbers? For example, if you score 25 then you can 
cross off any other number between 21 and 40. 
●
●
Tell children then to write down 15 numbers. Column 1 can contain 
numbers between 1 and 20, column 2 numbers between 21 and 40 
and so on. 
●
●
Select one of the bingo cards and read out the problem for children to 
solve. For example, 5 squared minus 12. If children have the answer 
13 written in the correct column on their bingo card, they cross that 
number off or cover it with a counter. 
●
●
Encourage children to volunteer their answers so that you can pick up 
any misunderstandings. 
●
●
The winner is the player who crosses all their numbers off and calls out 
‘Bingo-bingo!’

Variations 
●
●
Increase the size of the grid from 5 x 5 to 6 x 6, 7 x 7, 8 x 8, etc.
●
●
The winner could be the first person to cross off the numbers in a column, a 
diagonal, or get a full house.   
●
●
The winner could be the first to get four square numbers
●
●
Instead of three cards, challenge children to make the numbers using four or 
five cards.
●
●
Make the target numbers on the grid bigger.
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent a similar game in which the numbers in the grid are all prime 
numbers? 
●
●
Can you work out whether it makes a difference or not if the numbers in the 
grid are placed randomly?   
Children then write the numbers 1–25 anywhere on the grid. For 
example:
5
16
9

Now select three cards from a well-shuffled pack of 0–9 digit cards. 
●
●
Challenge children to make the numbers on their grid using the three 
digit cards drawn. When a number has been made then that number is 
crossed off. 
●

Coloured counters
Colour by numbers is an exciting game that combines all 
four operations in a colourful number square.
What to do
●
●
Ask children to get into threes and give them a copy of the coloured 
1–100 number grid as shown below:
●
●
Players each receive six coloured counters.
●
●
Players take it in turns to throw four dice.   
●
●
The dice are combined to make a number on the 1–100 grid using 
any operation.  For example, if you threw a 5, 5, 2 and 6 then you 
could simply add them to make 18 or you could multiply the 5 and 5, 
multiply the 2 and 6, add the two totals together and cover 37. You 
could divide 5 and 5, divide 6 by 2 and then subtract these totals to

Can you throw five dice mentally and add up the totals round the sides if the 
numbers thrown are 2, 3, 4, 5, 5?
●
●
Can you invent your own dice visualisations? Can you think of combining dice 
with another mathematical object? For example, dice and a 1–100 number 
grid. What questions could you think of combining these two? Try to think of 
ten questions for another group to try.  
●
●
Ask children to now imagine throwing two dice and they land on the 
table as a double 4. What numbers are touching the table (double 3)?
●
●
Mentally throw the dice again. This time the numbers are 5 and 4. 
Find the total of these dice (9) and then multiply by the total of the 
numbers touching the table (2 + 3 = 5; 9 x 5 = 45).
●
●
Clear your mind. Now throw three dice. The numbers thrown are 2, 4, 6.  
Add these together and add to the total of the numbers touching the 
table (2 + 4 + 6 = 12; 5 + 3 + 1 = 9; 12 + 9 = 21). 
●
●
Now imagine throwing a die on its own. The number you throw is a 6. 
What do the numbers round the sides add up to? (6 is on top and 1 is 
on the bottom, leaving 2, 3, 4, 5 making 14 when added together).

●
Children team up with a partner to work together. Ask children how 
they could organise their reversed numbers so that they could look for 
patterns in the answers.
●
●
What do the answers have in common?
●
●
Share solutions together. There are many patterns that can be found. 
For example, 
13 + 31 = 44
16 + 61 = 77
98 + 89 = 187
56 + 65 = 121
●
●
If the sum of the digits in the 2-digit number is less than 10 then the 
sum of the reversed numbers is less than 100.
	
17 + 71 = 88
●
●
Can children invent a statement to say what they notice? For example, 
●
●
the sum of the digits in a 2-digit number determines the sum of the 
reversed numbers: if the sum is 8 the answer is 88, if the sum is 4 
then the sum of the reversed numbers is 44.

Circle sums is a great problem for performing a variety of 
calculations in an interesting and challenging context.
What to do
●
●
Get children to draw nine circles in a 3 x 3 array.
●
●
Now introduce the problem to everyone: write the numbers 1–9 inside 
the circles so that the sums of the three numbers on each side are a) all 
different sums, b) all the same sums, c) all even sums, d) all odd sums.
●
●
Read the problem again and make sure that everyone understands that 
they can use each of the numbers 1–9 once only. 
●
●
Discuss ideas and continue until the circles are full.

Variations 
●
●
There are various statements to investigate. You could present children with 
a collection of ‘Number’ statements, ‘Shape’ statements and so on, or choose 
to theme them. For example, you might select to focus on decimal and  
fraction statements such as, ‘A decimal number with three digits is bigger 
than one with two digits’, ‘

●
Present children with 3–6 statements to discuss rather than one. 
●
●
Make a display of the statements discussed and place children’s responses 
around them. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent your own statements for another group to discuss? 
For example,
1.	A composite number has more factors than a square number.
2.	There are no prime numbers ending in zero.
3.	An isosceles triangle has at least two equal sides.
4.	Angles on a line add up to 90°.
5.	A square is a rectangle.
6.	The opposite sides of a die always add up to 7.
7.	A rectangle has four lines of symmetry.
8.	The next number after 2.5 is 2.6.
9.	A pyramid has four faces.
10.	 Dividing a number always makes it smaller.
11.	 The square of a number is bigger than the number.
12.	 The more digits a number has, the greater its value.
13.	 If you multiply an odd number by a square number then the answer is odd.
●
●
The envoys return to their own groups after 5 minutes and share the 
thinking they have just listened to.  
●
●
Come together as a whole class and ask groups to volunteer their 
thoughts and the statement is debated. For example, ‘We think 
multiplying by one means the number stays the same’, ‘We think that 
the number will get smaller if you multiply by a fraction’, and so on. 
●
●
After discussing one statement, investigate another such as ‘Dividing 
will always make a smaller number.’

2 = 4/4 + 4/4
3 = (4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 4
4 = 4 + (4 x (4 − 4))
5 = ((4 x 4) + 4) ÷ 4
6 = (4 + 4) ÷ 4 + 4
7 = 44/4 − 4
8 = 4 + 4 + 4 − 4
9 = 4 + 4 + 4/4
10 = (44 − 4) ÷ 4
Here are the answers from 1 to 10:
(3 + 3) ÷ (3 + 3) = 1
(3 ÷ 3) + (3 ÷ 3) = 2
(3 × 3) − (3 + 3) = 3
((3 × 3 + 3) ÷ 3) = 4
(3 + 3) − (3 ÷ 3) = 5
(3 + 3) + (3 − 3) = 6
(3 + 3) + (3 ÷ 3) = 7
(3 × 3) − (3 ÷ 3) = 8
(3 × 3) × (3 ÷ 3) = 9
(3 × 3) + (3 ÷ 3) = 10

Number hop
Suitable for 
KS1
KS2
Aims
●
●
To creatively combine number operations. 
●
●
To work flexibly with a range of numbers.
Players
●
●
Pairs, small group, whole class
Resources
●
●
Paper and pencils (or whiteboards and pens)
●
●
Number cards 1–9
Number hop is a great game for mental number work 
helping children to practise multiplication, division, addition 
and subtraction.
What to do
●
●
Shuffle the cards and select two cards to make a 2-digit number. 
●
●
Challenge children to change the 2-digit number created into 10 in just 
two number/operation hops.
●
●
For example, if 4 and 5 are selected to make 45, then 45 can be 
reduced to 10 by dividing by 5 and then adding one. Can children find 
other ways to get to 10? Investigate together (÷9 and x2, ÷9 and +5, 
x2 and ÷9, −5 and ÷4, +5 and ÷5).
●
●
Play the game as a whole class first to familiarise children with it and 
then let children play in small groups or in pairs.
●
●
Challenge children to work out whether all 2-digit numbers can be 
reduced to 10 in two hops.

Investigations
Variations 
●
●
Rather than make 10 in two hops, change to three hops. 
●
●
Rather than deal two cards, deal three cards and reduce to a new number. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Which 2-digit numbers have the most ways of making 10?
●
●
Is there a connection between the number of possibilities and the number of 
factors?
●
●
Do numbers in a particular times table have more possibilities?

Balloon numbers challenges children to think hard about 
number properties and why, in a row of numbers, one may be 
the odd one out.
What to do
●
●
Tell children there are six numbers crowded in the basket of a hot air 
balloon which is quickly losing height. 
●
●
To save the balloon from crashing, children in 2s or 3s have to decide 
which number should be ejected, and more importantly, why that 
number should leave. 
●
●
Provide some examples to get children started. 
●
●
For example, imagine the numbers in the basket are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 
and 30. You could argue that 5 should go because it is the only single-
digit number. Then again it could be 25 because that’s the only square 
number. Number 30 has the most factors and so on.

Number hunters challenges children to hunt for particular 
types of number in their environment.
What to do
●
●
Organise children into pairs or small groups of three or four. 
●
●
Tell children that they are going to go on a number quest looking for 
types of number. To start with, challenge them to find 12 prime  
numbers in the classroom.
●
●
Children keep a list of the numbers they find and what the numbers 
relate to. For example, 2nd – today’s date, 13 – the number of girls in 
the class, 7 – classroom number, etc.
●
●
The rule is that no more than two numbers can come from the same 
place. For example, you cannot just take numbers from a book. The 
primes have to come from different sources.
●
●
After five or ten minutes, talk together as a class and share the  
primes found.

Up and down is a very thought-provoking investigation 
that challenges children to use a variety of problem-solving 
skills.
What to do
●
●
Introduce the problem to children as a story as follows:
A snail crawls 4m up a wall during the daytime. After all the effort of 
climbing the snail stops for a while to rest and then falls asleep. The next 
morning the snail wakes up to find it has slipped down 1m while asleep.
●
●
Now set children the challenge itself: if this happens every day, how 
many days will the snail take to reach the top of a wall 58m in height?

This activity could be adapted for a spider trying to climb up a drainpipe. For 
example, a spider started climbing the side of a tall building. The building is 
21m. It started climbing up the building at 6 a.m. It took the spider 15  
minutes to climb 3m. At the end of every 15 minute period the spider had 
a rest and slipped backwards 1m. What time did the spider reach the top of 
the building? If pupils draw a line to solve this problem they could show that 
the spider would take 195 minutes to get to the top of the building and reach 
the top at 9.15 a.m.     
●
●
Allow children to reflect on the problem independently before  
organising children into pairs or small groups. 
●
●
Listen to children’s ideas and the strategies they would use to solve the 
problem. How different are they? 
●
●
Now let children work together in mixed ability pairs/groups to solve 
the problem. 
●
●
Remind children of the UPR problem-solving process they need to take 
when approaching a problem such as this. For example,
Understanding the problem (What do you need to know? What do you 
need to find out?)
Planning and communicating a solution (How will you solve the 
problem?) 
Reflecting and generalising (Can more than one strategy be used?)
●
●
You may want to provide children with a planning sheet in order to 
solve the problem or let them invent their own.
●
●
Share ideas together and talk through the problem. 
●
●
Describe that one way of solving this problem would be to draw a  
diagram which you could model or get a pair/group to model. 
●
●
Now explain the solution as follows:   
On the first day, the snail climbs up 4m and slips down 1m while 
sleeping. This means the next morning the snail is 3m from where it 
started. The snail thus travels 3m upwards every day. Therefore, in 18 
days, it has travelled a distance of 54m from the bottom. On the last 
day, the snail travels 4m upwards and hence reaches the top of the 
wall in a total of 19 days.

Challenge question
●
●
Can you work out an alternative solution to this problem through an 
equation? For example, let x be the number of days the snail takes to reach 
the top of the wall 58m in height. On the last day, the snail will reach the 
top by travelling 4m upwards and there will not be any question of slipping 
down. The number of remaining days excluding the last day are (x − 1). 
Since the snail climbs up 4m and slips down 1m while sleeping, it travels 
3m upwards on each of these remaining days. So,  
Distance travelled on last day + distance travelled on remaining days =  
Wall height; or 
4 + 3 (x − 1) = 58 
On solving the above equation, we get 
3 (x − 1) = 58 − 4 = 54; or 
x = (54 / 3) + 1 = 19

●
19 bicycles will have 38 wheels so 47 – 38 = 9 extra wheels. As 
bicycles have 2 wheels and tricycles have 3 wheels, there is 1 extra 
wheel per tricycle in the park. Thus, the 9 extra wheels belong to 3 
tricycles.

A sticky problem is an interesting challenge that 
encourages children to act out the problem or use a drawing.
What to do
●
●
Introduce the problem to the class: 
A witch retires from her job and decides to saw her broomstick into 
eight pieces for firewood. Each cut takes her 20 seconds. How long 
will it take her to cut the broomstick into pieces?
●
●
Give the problem to pairs of children for a 2 minute discussion before 
taking feedback from the class as a whole. Talk about different ways of 
potentially solving the problem. Is there a strategy that would be more 
efficient than any other?

GAMES, IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Variations 
●
●
Instead of art straws you could use plasticine, strips of paper or string. 
●
●
This problem lends itself to many adaptations. For example, the number 
of cuts could be changed to a bigger or smaller number. The time taken to 
make a cut could also be changed. For example, a workman is cutting a 
metal pipe into 9 pieces. It takes him 16 seconds to make one cut. How long 
will it take him to cut the pipe into 9 pieces?  
Challenge questions 
●
●
Did you realise that the end pieces are not cut?  
●
●
Why is it a good idea to use more than one strategy when solving a problem 
like this? 
●
●
Can you invent a problem similar to the one above but have each cut taking 
10.25 seconds? Does this make it more challenging?   
●
●
Now give each pair some art straws and scissors as something they 
could use to help them solve the problem.   
●
●
Remind the children of the UPR problem-solving approach to the 
challenge:
Understanding the problem (What do you need to know? What do you 
need to find out?)
Planning and communicating a solution (How will you solve the problem?) 
Reflecting and generalising (Can more than one strategy be used?)
●
●
Probably the most common mistake in this problem is understanding 
how many cuts the witch will make. Many children will say that the 
witch will make eight cuts as she wants eight pieces. If they answer in 
this way then they will work out 8 x 20 seconds = 160 seconds or  
2 minutes and 40 seconds.  
●
●
Take children’s answers and talk through them together. Do the 
children realise that the witch will only need to make 7 cuts, which is 
7 x 2 = 140 seconds or 2 minutes and 20 seconds?
●
●
Show this as a drawing on the board and demonstrate using art straws.

Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you find an easier way of adding the numbers 1–25? Which  
numbers would you add together to make it an easier sum to total?
●
●
Can you invent a similar problem that involves 100 guests at a party? Is there 
a short-cut way of finding the answer if you know how many Bonjours were 
said if 25 guests attended? Do you simply multiply by 4?        
●
●
Talk through the problem with children by creating an organised list. 
For example,
The 1st guest says 24 Bonjours (one Bonjour to everyone at the reunion)
The 2nd guest says 23 Bonjours (because the 1st person has already 
said Bonjour to them)
The 3rd guest says 22 Bonjours
The 4th guest says 21 Bonjours
The 5th guest says 20 Bonjours, etc.

●
Tell children that the easiest way to solve the problem is to add the 
numbers from 25 to 1, e.g. 25 + 24 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 20, etc. 
This results in 325 Bonjours in total.

Share one example with the children as follows: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 and  
6 + 7 + 8 = 21. If you subtract 12 from 21 you get 9. Can they see 
how it is done now?
●
●
The middle number is the difference between the sums of the three 
numbers on the left and right. So, 51 + 7 + 8 = 66 and  
22 + 19 + 6 = 47. This means that the ? is 66 − 47 which is 19.

Variations
●
●
You can vary the numbers on either side and this will make little difference 
unless you alter the format so that the first number, middle number and last 
number always make the same total, e.g. 15. 
●
●
Change the middle three numbers so that they total a new number, e.g. 14.
●
●
Increase the number of digits in each row to complicate things further. 
Challenge questions 
●
●
Can you invent a new format? For example, the 2nd number on the left and 
the 2nd to last always total 9.
●
●
How many different reasons can you think of to justify one row being the odd 
one out rather than any other row? 
●
●
Explain to children that there is an odd row in the collection of rows 
they can see and they have to work out which one it is and why.
●
●
This problem could have many solutions because children will  
volunteer a variety of answers that could all feasibly be right. Explain 
that you will credit imaginative solutions but that you are really looking 
for just one solution.
●
●
Give children some clues to help them solve the problem if you deem 
this appropriate. Explain that the middle three numbers are important 
in each row.
●
●
Can the children see a link? If they can’t, tell them to look at row A and 
total the middle 3 numbers (6 + 3 + 1 = 10). Now compare this to 
the middle three numbers of row B (5 + 3 + 2 = 10). This should be 
enough to set them racing off to find the middle digits which don’t add 
up to 10.
●
●
Row F is the odd row out because it contains three middle digits that 
total to 11.

Truth or lie is an extended maths activity that requires 
children to be systematic in their approach to solving the 
problem.
What to do
●
●
Introduce the problem to children as follows:
Kanezah was away from school for the school sports day. She asked 
six of her friends to tell her the number of the winner of a particular 
race. Only four of her friends gave the right answer. Using the clues 
below, which number was the winner?
Maimoona – it was even
Tehzeena – it was odd

Chloe – it was prime
Jake – it was a square number
Maisy – it had 2 digits
Megan – it was between 6 and 12
●
●
Ask children to work in small groups or pairs to try and make sense of 
the problem together. 
●
●
Ask children to suggest ways of working out the solution. Check they 
understand the problem, i.e. it is the number they are looking for. 
●
●
Share with children a way of solving the problem if you find they are 
having difficulty. 
●
●
One of the best ways of solving the problem is to draw a table and 
work through a set of numbers systematically. 
●
●
Explain to children that this is a step-by-step problem that will reveal 
the result because 4 crosses in the table will mean 4 truths.

You can use a variety of operations or steps. For example, double the first 
number, find the digital root, multiply by 6 and then subtract 3.

Try to solve the problem as a class by having children volunteer to write the 
numbers on a whiteboard and hold them in front of the whole class. This 
may help children to visualise the numbers and steps better.  
Challenge question
●
●
Can you invent your own number step problem like this, but arranging the 
numbers in a different way other than in a row? For example, you could have 
numbers on each vertex of a hexagon with a missing number in the middle.  
●
●
Give children time to look carefully at the first row and spot any  
connections.
●
●
See what solutions children come up with before sharing the actual 
solution you are following.
Solution: Multiply the first two digits to make the 2nd number.  Add 
the digits of the second number to get the 3rd number. Square the 3rd 
number to get the 4th number. Add the digits of the 4th number to get 
the last number. So, the missing numbers are:

APPENDICES
Challenges
Problem-solving is widely recognised as being one of the most useful skills 
learners can develop, which is why it occupies such a central role in the new 
primary mathematics curriculum.  
	
By solving problems, learners begin to apply their mathematical skills in 
new ways, they develop a deeper understanding of mathematical ideas and 
get a taste of the experience of ‘being a mathematician’. With success comes 
a sense of achievement, enjoyment and an appetite for more. Problem-solving 
increases their confidence, builds up their stamina and rewards perseverance. 
By the process of regular practice and challenge, learners can store up these 
experiences for future use. 
	
Previous chapters have mapped out possible routes for lessons using a range 
of problems with a variety of ideas for developing and extending them. In this 
appendix, we offer just the problems themselves for you to develop as you wish. 
They include a wide variety of puzzles, posers and brain-teasers. They could 
be used as starter questions, for small group work, for fast finishers or given 
as homework activities. They are suitable for a range of ages and abilities but 
are provided as additional stretches and challenges to further engage children 
in solving problems to help improve their using and applying skills, their 
mathematical reasoning, verbalisation and mathematical literacy. They could 
be given for solo completion but they are recommended for use with others to 
develop mathematical thinking and collaborative working. It is intended that 
the problems in this appendix will provide diverse opportunities to help learners 
increase their sense of number and apply their mathematics with increasing 
sophistication, confidence and fluency.

How can you take 45 from 45 to leave 45?
Answer:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 = 45
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 45
8 6 4 1 9 7 5 3 2 = 45
The number 45 is the sum of the digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. You can solve this 
problem by arranging the digits in reverse order and subtracting. The difference 
between them, 8 6 4 1 9 7 5 3 2, will add to make 45.

A problem with legs
A praying mantis has six legs, a spider has eight legs and a rat has four legs. In 
the zoo, I counted 612 legs which came from an equal number of each of these 
animals. How many animals are there in my zoo?
Answer: 102. There are the same number of each animal, so for every praying 
mantis, spider and rat we have 18 legs. 612 ÷ 18 = 34 of each animal which 
gives a total of 34 x 3 = 102 animals.

always a multiple of 9? 
b)	 If you start with any 2-digit number and subtract the sum of its digits, you 
always get an even number. 
c)	 Let all vowels = 1.65 and all consonants = 0.8. What is the value of your

7 x 9 = 63
8 x 8 = 64
Does this work for other sets of consecutive numbers?
