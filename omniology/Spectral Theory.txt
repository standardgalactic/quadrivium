Spectrum and resolvent
Example 1.1 Deﬁne, for h ∈R, the operator τh on L2(R) by
τhf(x) = f(x −h).
Show that τh is bounded.
Obviously, τh is linear, and it follows from
∥τhf∥2
2 =
 +∞
−∞
|f(x −h)|2dx =
 +∞
−∞
|f(x)|2dx = ∥f∥2
2,
that ∥Tf∥2 = ∥f∥2 for all f ∈L2(R), hence ∥T∥= 1.
Remark 1.1 Here we add that τh is also regular. In fact, if τhf = 0, then f(x −h) = 0 for all x ∈R,
thus f ≡0. This shows that τh is injective, hence the inverse operator exists. Then we get by the
change of variable y = x −h, i.e. x = y + h, that τhf(x + h) = f(x), and we infer that
(τh)−1f(x) = f(x + h) = τ−hf(x),
so also ∥(τh)−1∥= 1, and we have proved that τh is regular for every h ∈R. ♦

Example 1.2 Consider in L2(R) the operator Q deﬁned by
Qf(x) = x f(x),
with
D(Q) = {f ∈L2(R) | Qf ∈L2(R)}.
Determine ϱ(Q) and σp(Q).
A qualiﬁed guess is that ϱ(Q) = C \ R. Let λ ∈C \ R. We shall prove that Qλ = Q −λ I is regulær.
Write λ = ξ + i η, where ξ, η ∈R and η ̸= 0. It follows from the equation
Qλf(x) = Qf(x) −λ f(x) = (x −λ)f(x) = g(x),
that
Q−1
λ g(x) = f(x) = g(x)
x −λ =
g(x)
(x −ξ) + i η .
It follows for η ̸= 0 that

|g(x)|2
|(x −ξ) + i η|2 ≤

|η|2 |g(x)|2,
and we infer that Q−1

Hence,
Q−1
λ

|η| =

|Im λ|,
and we have proved that C \ R ⫅ϱ(Q).
Then let λ ∈R. As before, Q−1

λ g(x) = g(x)
λ −x,

.
Due to the singularity at x = λ, the inverse Q−1
λ
is not deﬁned in all of L2(R). However, it is easily
seen that the subspace
U = {f ∈L2(R) | ∃ε > 0 ∀x ∈[λ −ε, λ + ε] : f(x) = 0}
of L2(R) is dense in L2(R), so we conclude from U ⫅D

Q−1


that Q−1
λ
is densely deﬁned and
unbounded, hence λ ∈σc(Q) for every λ ∈R. Utilizing that the splitting of the spectral sets is
disjoint, we conclude that
ϱ(Q) = C \ R,
σp(Q) = ∅,
σc(Q) = R,
σr(Q) = ∅.

Hence, if Tλx = 0, then
λ a1 = 0
and
λ ak = ak−1,
k ≥2.
We have two possibilities:
1) If λ = 0, then a1 = λa2 = 0, and ak−1 = λ ak = 0, thus x = 0, and T0 = T is injective, so λ = 0 is
not an eigenvalue.
2) If λ ̸= 0, then a1 = 0 and ak = 1
λ ak−1, hence we get by recursion that all ak = 0, which means
that x = 0. This proves that every Tλ is injective.
Summing up we have proved that T −1

Hence we conclude that T −1

{λ ∈C | 0 < |λ| < 1} ⫅σ(T).
The set σ(T) is closed, so it follows from σ(T) ∩ϱ(T) = ∅that
σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}

ϱ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1}.

because the series is convergent for all λ ∈C, and the sum function above has a removable singularity

Assume that the equation Tx = λ x is fulﬁlled. It follows from the above that
λ ak = ak−1

and
λ a−k = a−k−1

If λ = 0, then Tx = 0, and we get from ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥= 0 that x = 0, hence λ = 0 /∈σp(T).
If λ ̸= 0, then we get by recursion,
ak =

which of course is divergent for every λ ∈C. We conclude that T does not have eigenvalues, hence
σp(T) = ∅.
Example 1.6 Deﬁne, for h ∈R+, the operator τh on L2(R) by
τhf(x) = f(x −h).
Show that τh has no eigenvalues and that
σ (τh) ⊂{z ∈C | |z| = 1}.
(It is in fact true that σ (σh) = {z ∈C | |z| = 1}.)
Remark 1.2 Note that if h = 0, then τ0 = I, and λ = 1 is trivially an eigenvalue with all of L2(R)
as its eigenspace. For that reason we assume that h > 0. ♦

If |λ| = 1, then |f(x −h)| = |f(x)|, h > 0. Thus the function |f(x)| is periodic of period h > 0, hence

hence for almost every x ∈R. Then x is represented by the zero function, and we infer that no λ ∈C
satisfying |λ| = 1 can be an eigenvalue.
It has previously been proven in Example 1.1 that (τh)−1 = τ−h. Of course, this can also be proved
directly,
τ−hτhf(x) = τ−hf(x −h) = f(x −h + h) = f(x) = If(x),
and
τhτ−hf(x) = τhf(x + h) = f(x + h −h) = f(x) = If(x).
It is also obvious that

because
λ (τh)−1 = |λ| < 1. Therefore, {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1} ⊂ϱ(τh), and thus

which implies that
σ (τh) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| = 1}.
Finally,
σp(τh) ⫅σ (τh)

σp (τh) ∩{λ ∈C | |λ| = 1} = ∅,
from which follows that σp (τh) = ∅.
Example 1.7 Given below some closed linear operators from ℓ2 into ℓ2. Check in each case if the
operator is singular.
1) T1x = (x2, x3, . . . ).
2) T2z =
1
2 x1, 1
22 x2, 1
23 x3, . . .

.
3) T3x = (0, x1, x2, . . . ).
4) T4x = (0, x2, x3, . . . ).
A linear operator is singular, if at least one of the following three conditions if satisﬁed:
1) There exists an f ∈D(T) \ {0}, such that Tf = 0.
2) The inverse T −1 exists, and D (T −1) = TD(T) = Y , while T −1 itself is unbounded.
3) The inverse T −1 exists, but it is not densely deﬁned in Y , thus TD(T) ̸= Y .
We shall below check these three conditions.
1) It follows by choosing x = (1, 0, 0, . . . ) ̸= 0 that T1x = 0, hence T1 is singular of type (1). This
means that 0 ∈σp(T1), i.e. 0 is an eigenvalue of T1.
2) Clearly, T2x = 0 implies that x = 0, so T2 is injective and the inverse exists. Then we solve the
equation T2x = y, thus
T2x =
1
2 x1, 1
22 x2, 1
23 x3, . . .

= (y1, y2, y2, . . . ) = y.

Let U be the subspace consisting of all sequences which are 0 eventually. Then clearly,
U ⊂D

T −1
2

⊂ℓ2.
The subspace U is dense in ℓ2, so this is also the case for the larger subspace D

T −1
2

. Furthermore,
it follows from the deﬁnition of the inverse T −1
2
that it is unbounded, i.e. T2 is singular of type
(2). This means that 0 ∈σc (T2) lies in the continuous spectrum for T2.
3) It is obvious that T3 is injective and that

y = (y2, y2, y4, . . . )

Clearly, T −1
3
is bounded, though not densely deﬁned, so T3 is of type (3), corresponding to that
0 ∈σr(T3) lies in the residual spectrum for T3.
4) We infer from T4x = 0 for x = (1, 0, 0, . . . ) ̸= 0 that 0 is an eigenvalue, 0 ∈σp (T4), hence T4 is
singular of type (1).
Example 1.8 Let V denote the Banach space (C([0, 1]), ∥· ∥∞), and let the operator T be given by
Tf(x) =
 x
0
f(t) dt,
f ∈V.
Check if T is regular.
The inverse operator of T is the diﬀerential operator D, given by
D(D) = {f ∈C1([0, 1]) | f(0) = 0},
Df = df
dx = f ′
for f ∈C1([0, 1]),
f(0) = 0.
It is easily seen (e.g. by using Weierstraß’s Approximation Theorem) that D(D) is dense in V . On
the other hand, D is unbounded. In fact, choose
fn(x) = sin(πnx),
x ∈[0, 1],
fn ∈D(D).
then
Dfn(x) = π n · cos(πnx),
x ∈[0, 1],
hence ∥fn∥∞= 1 and ∥Dfn∥∞= πn.
Remark 1.3 A simpler example is of course gn(x) = xn, x ∈[0, 1]. However, the fn occur very
frequently as an example in other cases, so we have chosen to present it here. ♦
We have proved that T is singular of type (2), i.e. 0 ∈σc(T) lies in the continuous spectrum for T.

1. Spectrum and resolvent
Example 1.9 Let H = L2(R), and let g be a bounded continuous real function deﬁned on R. Prove
that the operator T given by
Tf(x) = g(x)f(x),
f ∈L2(R),
belongs to B(H).
Find a necessary and suﬃcient condition on g that T is regular.
When g is bounded, ∥g∥∞< +∞, then
∥Tf∥2

g(x)2|f(x)|2dx ≤∥g∥2

 +∞

|f(x)|2dx = ∥g∥2
∞· ∥f∥2
2,
hence ∥Tf∥2 ≤∥g∥∞· ∥f∥2 for all f ∈H, and we infer that T ∈B(H) with ∥T∥≤∥g∥∞.
Then we shall ﬁnd when T is regular, i.e. when T fulﬁls the following three conditions:
1) The equation Tf = 0 has only the trivial solution f = 0, so T −1 exists.
2) The inverse operator T −1 is densely deﬁned, i.e.
D

T −1
= T

L2(R)

is dense in L2(R).
3) The inverse operator T −1 is bounded.
We now check each of these conditions:
1) It follows from Tf(x) = g(x) · f(x) that Tf = 0, if and only if g(x) · f(x) = 0 for almost every
x ∈R. Therefore, if we want always to conclude that f = 0 (in L2(R)), then we must assume that
g(x) ̸= 0 for almost every x ∈R.
2) Then we want that T −1 is bounded. It follows from Tf(x) = g(x)f(x) = h(x) that
f(x) = T −1h(x) =
1
g(x) h(x),
and then the same consideration as above shows that we must require that

g

< +∞.
3) Based on the conditions above, assume that
0 < b ≤|g(x)| < a < +∞,
for all x ∈R.
Then clearly all three conditions are fulﬁlled, so these conditions are suﬃcient that both T and
T −1 ∈B(H).

1. Spectrum and resolvent
Choosing x1 = 1, we get by either induction or by recursion – both methods can be applied – that
xk = λk−1, and an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ must necessarily be of the form
x = x1
+∞

k=1
λk−1ek.
This candidate belongs to the Hilbert space, if and only if

k=0
|λ|2k < +∞,
i.e. if and only if |λ| < 1. We infer that
σp(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| < 1}.
If on the other hand λ ∈C satisﬁes |λ| < 1, then we get by insertion that x = +∞
k=1 λk−1ek is an
eigenvector, so λ ∈σp(T), and we have proved that
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1}.
Then assume that λ ∈C satisﬁes |λ| > 1. We shall prove that λ ∈ϱ(T).
Remark 1.4 If here one tries directly to ﬁnd the inverse operator T −1
λ , thus try to solve the equation
Tλx = y with respect to x ∈H for given yn ∈H, then we end up with an unpleasant inﬁnite system
of equations of the form
(1) xk+1 −λ xk = yk,
k ∈N,
where the solution also must satisfy
+∞

k=1
|xk|2 < +∞.
Even this is possible, it is very diﬃcult to solve this system of equations. Hence we search an alternative
method of solution. ♦

which can also be found directly, if we work on (1). However, the precise solution is not so interesting
in this connection. ♦
We infer that
{λ ∈C | |λ| > 1} ⫅ϱ(T).
Now, σ(T) is closed and disjoint from ϱ(T), and
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1} ⫅σ(T),
hence
σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}
og
ϱ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1}.
Example 1.11 Consider the Banach space (C([0, 1]), ∥· ∥∞). Let v ∈C([0, 1]) be real, and let the
operator T be deﬁned by
Tf(x) = v(x)f(x).
Find σ(T) and ϱ(T).
We conclude from
∥Tf∥∞= ∥v(x)f(x)∥∞≤∥v∥∞∥f∥∞,
where we get equality by choosing f = v, that ∥T∥= ∥v∥∞. Then it follows that
σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥v∥∞}.
Now, v is continuous, and [0, 1] is compact, hence v([0, 1]) is also compact. Let λ /∈v([0, 1]). Then
there exists a bλ > 0, such that
|v(x) −λ| ≥bλ
for all x ∈[0, 1].

Then
Tλf(x) = {v(x) −λ}f(x) = g(x) ∈C([0, 1])
for
f(x) = T −1
λ g(x) =
g(x)
v(x) −λ ∈C([0, 1]).
It follows that ∥Tλ∥≤1
bλ
, hence Tλ ∈B(C([0, 1])), and
ϱ(T) ⫆C \ v([0, 1])
and
σ(T) ⫅v([0, 1]).
If conversely λ ∈v([0, 1]), then there exists an x0 ∈[0, 1], such that v(x0) = λ. Then the equation
Tλf = g cannot be solved for any g, for which f(x0) ̸= 0, because then the candidate f then will not
be continuous at x0. Hence we ﬁnally get
σ(T) = v([0, 1])
and
ϱ(T) = C \ v([0, 1]).
Example 1.12 Consider in the Banach space ℓ∞the operator T given by
T (x1, x2, . . . ) = (x2, x3, . . . ) .
Find ϱ(T), σp(T), σc(T) and σr(T).
We get from ∥Tx∥∞≤∥x∥∞with equality for
|x1| ≤sup
i≥2
|xi|,
that ∥T∥= 1, hence σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}.
Therefore, if λ ∈σp(T), then |λ| ≤1, and there exists an x ̸= 0, such that Tx = λ x, i.e.
xk+1 = λ xk = · · · = λkx1.
We can therefor put x1 = 1 for an eigenvector, and thus any eigenvector has the form of a constant
times

1, λ, λ2, . . . , λn−1, . . .

.
It follows by insertion that this candidate indeed is an eigenvector, if it belongs to ℓ∞, i.e. if |λ| ≤1.
We conclude that
σp(T) = σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
and
ϱ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1},
and σc(T) = σr(T) = ∅.

1. Spectrum and resolvent
2) Assume that λ ∈σp(T). Then there exists an x ∈ℓ2 \ {0}, such that Tx = λ x. We get for the
n-th coordinate of this equation that
(2) x2n = λ xn,
n ∈N.
If λ = 0, then we get the conditions x2n = 0, n ∈N. It follows that if
+∞

n=0
|x2n+1|2 < +∞,
then (x1, 0, x3, 0, x5, 0, . . . ) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0, hence 0 ∈
σp(T), and the eigenspace corresponding to λ = 0 is spanned by {e2n−1 | n ∈N}, hence it is
inﬁnite dimensional, cf. the third question.
Assume that λ ∈σp(T) \ {0}. Then it follows from (2) with n = 2m−1q that
x2mq = λ xxn−1q = λ2 x2m−2q = · · · = λm xq,
m ∈N.
We get in particular for q = 1,
x2m = λm x1.
If we put x1 = 1 and xr = 0, when r is not of the form 2n, we get an eigenvector, if and only if
+∞

n=0
|λn|2 < +∞.
This condition is fulﬁlled if and only if |λ| < 1. Hence we conclude that the point spectrum is
given by
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1}.
3) Assume that λ ∈σp(T), so |λ| < 1. Then we get by a simple computation that every odd index
2q + 1, q ∈N0, determines an eigenvector x by
x(2q+1)·2n = λn,
n ∈N0,
og
xr = 0 otherwise.
All these eigenvectors are linearly independent, so we conclude that the eigenspace corresponding
to an eigenvalue λ ∈σp(T) is inﬁnite dimensional.
4) Now, T ∈B

ℓ2
, and ∥T∥= 1, so T ⋆∈B

ℓ2
and ∥T ⋆∥= 1.
We have for every x ∈ℓ2 and every y ∈ℓ2 that
(Tx, y)
=
((x2, x4, x6, . . . ), (y1, y2, y3, . . . )) =
+∞

n=1
x2n yn
=
((0, x2, 0, x4, 0, . . . ), (0, y1, 0, y2, 0, . . . )) = (x, T ⋆y) ,
so we infer that
T ⋆y = T ⋆(y1, y2, y3, . . . ) = (0, y1, 0, y2, 0, y3, . . . ),
y ∈ℓ2.

Furthermore,
TT ⋆x = T (T ⋆(x1, x2, x3, . . . )) = T(0, x1, 0, x2, 0, x3, . . . ) = (x1, x2, x3, . . . ) = x,
i.e. TT ⋆= I, and
T ⋆Tx = T ⋆(T(x1, x2, x3, . . . )) = T ⋆(x2, x4, x6, . . . ) = (0, x2, 0, x4, 0, x6, . . . ),
proving that T ⋆T = P is the projection onto the subspace of ℓ2 which is spanned by {e2n | n ∈N}.
5) It follows from ∥T| = 1 that
σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥T∥} = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}.
Furthermore,
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1} ⫅σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
and the spectrum is closed, hence
σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}
og
ϱ(T) = C \ σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1}.
Remark 1.6 It is also easy to prove that
σp (T ⋆) = ∅.
In fact, we get from T ⋆y = λ y that
(0, y1, 0, y2, 0, y3, . . . ) = λ (y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, . . . ).
If λ = 0, then the right hand side is 0, and this implies that yn = 0, thus y = 0, and 0 /∈σp (T ⋆). If
λ ̸= 0, then
0 = λ y2n+1,
n ∈N0,
and
yn = λ y2n,
n ∈N.
The former equation gives y2n+1 = 0, which is then inserted into the latter (follows by an iteration,
when n is even) to give y2n = 0, hence y = 0, and we have proved that σp (T ⋆) = ∅.
Now, σp (T ⋆) =, hence also σr(T) = ∅. Since σ(T) = σp(T) ∪σc(T) ∪σr(T) is a disjoint splitting of
the spectrum, we conclude that
ϱ(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ| > 1},
σ(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
σp(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ| < 1},
σc(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ| = 1},
σr(T)

∅.

1. Spectrum and resolvent
Example 1.14 Let X denote the Banach space of C([−1, 1])-functions equipped with the usual sup-
norm ∥· ∥∞, and let T ∈B(X) be given by
Tf = f(0) + f.
1) Find the norm of T.
2) Determine the resolvent set ϱ(T) for T and ﬁnd
T −1
λ
= (T −λI)−1
for all λ ∈ϱ(T).
3) Show that the spectrum for T is a pure point spectrum and ﬁnd all eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenfunctions.
4) Show that all f ∈X can be written as a sum of eigenfunctions belonging to diﬀerent eigenspaces,
and show that this decomposition is unique.
1) Clearly,
∥Tf∥∞≤|f(0)| + ∥f∥∞≤∥f∥∞+ ∥f∥∞= 2∥f∥∞,
where we obtain equality if e.g. f is a real function with maximum at 0, i.e. ∥T∥= 2.
2) Then we shall check when it is possible for all g ∈X to solve the equation
(T −λI)g = g,
f ∈X.
We get
(3) g(x) = Tf(x) −λ f(x) = f(0) + f(x) −λ f(x).
In particular for x = 0,
g(0) = f(0) + f(0) −λ f(0) = (2 −λ) f(0).
Now, the solution f must be continuous, so this equation cannot be solved for arbitrary g ∈X,
when λ = 2, hence 2 ∈σ(T).
If λ ̸= 2, then
f(0) =
1
2 −λ g(0),
which gives by insertion into (3),
g(x) −
1
2 −λ g(0) = (1 −λ) f(x).
Hence, if λ = 1, then this equation cannot be solved for an arbitrary g ∈X, so 1 ∈σ(T). If we
assume that λ ̸= 1, then we get the candidate of the solution
f(x) = T −1
λ g(x) =

∥g∥∞= C(λ) ∥g∥∞.
This implies that ϱ(T) ⫆C \ {1, 2}, and because we have proved above that {1, 2} ⫅σ(T), it
follows that
ϱ(T) = C \ {1, 2}
and
σ(T) = {1, 2}.
3) Here we shall prove that λ = 1 and λ = 2 are eigenvalues, i.e. we shall prove that the equation
Tf = f(0) + f(x) = λ f(x)
has non-trivial solutions for λ = 1 and λ = 2.
If λ = 1, then a check gives
f(0) + f(x) = f(x),
and the condition becomes f(0) = 0. Any function f ∈C([−1, 1]), for which f(0) = 0, is therefore
an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 1.

1. Spectrum and resolvent
If λ = 2, then
f(0) + f(x) = 2 f(x),
and we get the condition f(x) = f(0) for all x ∈[−1, 1]. This shows that every constant function
f(x) = c is an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 2, and we have proved that
σ(T) = {1, 2} = σp(T).
4) Let f ∈C([−1, 1]). Then we have the following splitting of f,
f(x) = {f(x) −f(0)} + f(0) = g(x) + h(x),
where g(x) = f(x)−f(0) satisﬁes g(0) = 0, so g belongs to the eigenspace corresponding to λ = 1,
and where h(x) = f(0) is constant, hence h(x) belongs to the eigenspace of the eigenvalue. This
proves the existence.
If conversely
f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
is such a splitting, then
Tf(x) = f(x) + f(0) = Tg(x) + Th(x) = g(x) + 2h(x),
and we get the two equations

g(x)
+
2h(x)
=
f(x) + f(0),
g(x)
+
h(x)
=
f(x),
from which we get h(x) = f(0) by subtraction, and then
g(x) = f(x) −h(x) = f(x) −f(0),
and we have proved the uniqueness.

T m−1f

= 0 for every f ∈H. Hence if T m−1f ̸= 0 for some
f ∈H, then T m−1f is an eigenvector for T, corresponding to λ = 0.
First ﬁnd the smallest m ∈N, such that T m = 0 and T m−1 ̸= 0. It follows from this that
σ(T) = σp(T) = {0},
and hence
ϱ(T) = C \ {0}.
Example 1.16 Let E be a Banach space and let P ∈B(E) satisfy P 2 = P.
1) Show that P −λ I is injective for λ ∈C \ {0, 1}.
2) Show that P −λ I is surjective for λ ∈C \ {0, 1}, and ﬁnd (P −λ I)−1.
3) Show that σ(P) = σp(P) = {0, 1}.
Remark 1.7 The latter claim of the example is not true, if P = 0 or I. In fact, it is well-known that
σ(0) = σp(0) = {0}
and
σ(I) = σp(I) = {1},
and it is obvious that both 02 = 0 and I2 = I. Of a similar reason we must assume in (2) that
λ /∈{0, 1}, while (1) also holds for 0 and I. ♦
1) Let λ ∈C \ {0, 1}, and assume that
(P −λ I)x = Px −λ x = 0,
i.e. Px = λ x. Then also
Px = P 2x = λ Px.
Because λ ̸= 1, we must have Px = 0, and since also λ ̸= 0, we get
x = 1
λ Px = 0,
and we have proved that P −λ I is injective.

2) Let again λ ∈C \ {0, 1}. Because P 2 = P, the formal Neumann series for (P −λ I)−1 can in

λ I ∈B(E)
and that in particular, P −λ I is surjective.
3) It follows from (2) that ϱ(P) ⫆C \ {0, 1}, hence σ(P) ⫅{0, 1}. We have also assumed that P ̸= 0
and P ̸= I, hence
{x ∈M | Px = 0} ̸= {0}, M,
and
{x ∈M | Px = x} ̸= {0}, M,
are the eigenspaces corresponding to λ = 0 and λ = 1, respectively, hence
σ(P) = σp(P) = {0, 1}.

The adjoint of a bounded operator
Example 2.1 Let T ∈B(H) where H is a Hilbert (or just Banach) space. Show that ∥Rλ(T)∥→0
for |λ| →∞.
Since T ∈B(H), we see that Rλ(T) = (T −λ I)−1 exists for every λ ∈C, for which |λ| > ∥T∥. Then

2. The adjoint a bounded operator
Example 2.3 Let T be a bounded operator on a Hilbert space H and assume that N and M are closed
subspaces of H. Show that
T(M) ⊂N
if and only if
T ⋆
N ⊥
⊂M ⊥.
Show moreover that
ker(T) = T ⋆(H)⊥
and
ker(T)⊥= T ⋆(H).
We assume that T(M) ⫅N, and we shall prove that T ⋆
N ⊥
⫅M ⊥.
Let x ∈M and y ∈N ⊥. By the assumption, Tx ∈N, thus
0 = (Tx, y) = (x, T ⋆y) .
Now, x ∈M was arbitrary, so it follows that T ⋆y ∈M ⊥. This holds for every y ∈N ⊥, hence
T ⋆
N ⊥
⫅M ⊥.
Then by iteration, T ⋆⋆
M ⊥⊥
⫅N ⊥⊥. However, T ⋆⋆= T and M ⊥⊥= M, and N ⊥⊥= N, so we
conclude that
T(M) ⫅N
if and only if
T ⋆
N ⊥
⫅M ⊥.
If x ∈ker(T), then Tx = 0, and ker(T) is a closed subspace. Then put M = ker(T) and N = {0},
and it follows from the above that
T ⋆
N ⊥
= T ⋆(H) ⫅ker(T)⊥,
thus
{T ⋆(H)}⊥⫆ker(T).
If conversely x ∈{T ⋆(H)}⊥, then for every y ∈H,
0 = (x, T ⋆y) = (Tx, y),
so Tx = 0, and we have x ∈ker(T). We have proved that
ker(T) = {T ⋆(H)}⊥.
Finally, it follows from this equation that
ker(T)⊥= {T ⋆(H)}⊥⊥= T ⋆(H),
where the bar means the closure of the set.
Example 2.4 Let T be a bounded operator on a Hilbert space H with ∥T∥= 1, and assume that we
can ﬁnd x0 ∈H such that Tx0 = x0. Show that also T ⋆x0 = x0.
First we get

∥T ⋆x0 −x0∥2 = (T ⋆x0 −x0, T ⋆x0 −x0)
=
(T ⋆x0, T ⋆x0) −(x0, T ⋆x0) −(T ⋆x0, x0) + (x0, x0)
=
∥T ⋆x0∥2 −(Tx0, x0) −(x0, Tx0) + ∥x0∥2
=
∥T ⋆x0∥2 −(x0, x0) −(x0, x0) + ∥x0∥2
=
∥T ⋆x0∥2 −∥x0∥2 ,

from which ∥T ⋆x0∥2 ≥∥x0∥2, or
∥x0∥≤∥T ⋆x0∥≤∥T ⋆∥· ∥x0∥= ∥T∥· ∥x0∥= ∥x0∥.
Thus we must have equality everywhere, and therefore in particular, ∥x0∥= ∥T ⋆x0∥, hence by inser-
tion,
∥T ⋆x0 −x0∥2 = ∥T ⋆x0∥2 −∥x0∥2 = ∥x0∥2 −∥x0∥2 = 0.
This shows that T ⋆x0 −x0, or after a rearrangement, T ⋆x0 = x0.

2. The adjoint a bounded operator
Summing up,
σp (T ⋆) = ∅.
Hence σr(T) = ∅. Furthermore,
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1} ⫅σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥T∥= 1},
and because σ(T) is closed, we must have
σ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}.
Utilizing that
σ(T) = σp(T) ∪σc(T) ∪r (T) = σp(T) ∪σc(T)
is a disjoint splitting, we ﬁnally ﬁnd the continuous spectrum
σc(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| = 1},
and the resolvent set
ϱ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1}.
Example 2.8 Let T : ℓ2 →ℓ2 be the linear operator given by
T(x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . ) = (x1 + x2, x2 + x3, . . . , xn + xn+1, . . . ).
1) Find the point spectrum σp(T) and determine all eigenvectors associated to λ ∈σp(T).
2) Determine ∥T∥.
3) Determine the adjoint T ⋆and ﬁnd also the point spectrum σp (T ⋆).
4) Let S = T −I. Determine ∥S∥.
5) Find σc(T) and σr(T) with the help of S above.
1) We shall ﬁnd the non-trivial solutions of the equation
Tx = λ x.
The coordinate equation of this equation becomes
xn + xn+1 = λ xn,
n ∈N,
thus
(4) xn+1 = (λ −1)xn,
n ∈N.
If λ = 1, then xn+1 = 0, so we can only choose x1 ̸= 0. On the other hand, e1 is clearly an
eigenvector and 1 ∈σp(T).

Figure 1: The point spectrum σp(T) is the open set inside the circle.
If λ ̸= 1, then we can divide (4) by (λ −1)n+1 ̸= 0. Then it follows by recursion that
xn+1
(λ −1)n+1 =
xn
(λ −1)n = · · · =
x1
λ −1,
so xn = (λ)n−1x1. Choosing x1 = 1 we see that one candidate of an eigenvector is given by its
coordinates xn = (λ −1)n−1. Because

n=1
|λ −1|2(n−1) =

n=0
|λ −1|2n
is convergent, if and only if |λ −1| < 1, it follows that
σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ −1| < 1}
with the eigenvectors

1, λ −1, (λ −1)2, . . . , (λ −1)n−1, . . .

,
for |λ −1| < 1.
We notice for λ = 1 that we get precisely (1, 0, 0, . . . ).
2) From
2 ∈σ(T) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥T∥},
and a consideration of the ﬁgure, it follows that ∥T∥≥2.
On the other hand, an application of Minkowski’s inequality gives
∥Tx∥= ∥x + (0, x1, x2, . . . )∥≤∥x∥+ ∥x∥= 2 ∥x∥,
proving that ∥T∥≤2.
Summing up, ∥T∥= 2.

that
T ⋆y = (y1, y1 + y2, y2 + y3, . . . , yn−1 + yn, . . . ),
or written in coordinates,
(T ⋆y)1 = y1,
(T ⋆y)n = yn−1 + yn
for n ≥2.
The equation T ⋆y = λ y is written in coordinates as
y1 = λ y1
and
yn−1 + yn = λ yn
for n ≥2,
thus
(λ −1) = y1 = 0
and
(λ −1)yn = yn−1
for n ≥2.
We get from the ﬁrst equation that either λ = 1 or y1 = 0. If λ = 1, then it follows from the last
equations that yn−1 = 0 for all n ≥2, hence y = 0, and λ = 1 is not an eigenvalue for T ⋆.

2. The adjoint a bounded operator
If λ ̸= 1 and y1 = 0, then we see by recursion on
yn =
1
λ −1 yn−1
that the only solution is y = 0.
Summing up, σp (T ⋆) = ∅.
Then of course, σr(T) = ∅.
4) Because
(Sx)n = (Tx)n −xn = xn+1,
and ∥Sx∥≤∥x∥with equality for x1 = 0, it follows immediately that ∥S∥= 1.
5) We get from T = S + I that T −λI = S −(λ −1)I, so
λ ∈σp(T)
if and only if
λ −1 ∈σp(S),
thus.
σp(T) = 1 + σp(S),
λ ∈σc(T)
if and only if
λ −1 ∈σc(S),
thus
σc(T) = 1 + σc(S),
λ ∈σr(T)
if and only if
λ −1 ∈σr(S),
thus
σr(T) = 1 + σr(S).
It is not surprising that the various parts of the spectrum for is obtained by translating the
corresponding parts of the spectrum for S. We now conclude from
σp(S) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1},
and
σr(S) = ∅,
(because σr(T) = ∅),
and from σ(S) being closed, and
σp(S) = {λ ∈C | |λ| < 1} ⫅σ(S) ⫅{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥S|} = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
that
σ(S) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
and hence that
σc(S) = {λ ∈C | |λ| = 1}.
Finally, by utilizing the translation, we get
σ(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ −1| ≤1},
σp(T)
=
{λ ∈C | |λ −1| < 1},
σc(T)

3) Determine the adjoint T ⋆.

and we deﬁne Tk = IkT. Show that there is a k ∈N such that
∥Tk∥< λ.
Use this to solve the equation

for a given y ∈ℓ2. Finally, show that the equation
(T −λ I)x = y
has a solution x = (T −λ T)−1y for all y ∈ℓ2.

If λ = 0, then clearly y = 0, so 0 /∈σp (T ⋆).

2. The adjoint a bounded operator
Because |λ| > 1, we can choose k so big that
∥Tk∥= 1 + 1
k < |λ|.
Now, λ /∈σp(T) ∪σr(T), so (T −λ I)−1 exists and is densely deﬁned.
It follows from ∥Tk∥< |λ|, that
(Tk −λ Ik)−1 ∈B

Ikℓ2
,
where Ikℓ2 is a Hilbert space which is isomorphic to ℓ2.
The equation
Tx −λ x = y,
y ∈ℓ2,
has the coordinate form
n + 1
n
xn+1 −λ xn = yn,
n ∈N.
Thus is follows from λ ̸= 0 that

n ∈{1, . . . , k −1},
Tkx −λ Ikx = Iky.
It follows from the above that the latter equation can be solved,
Ikx = (Tk −λ Ik)−1 Iky
for all y ∈ℓ2.
Hence for a given y ∈ℓ2,
Ikx = (0, . . . , 0, xk, xk+1, . . . ) = (Tk −λ Ik)−1 Iky
is uniquely determined. The recursion formula
xn = 1
λ

,
for n ∈{1, . . . , k −1},
determines the remaining elements of x, so (T −λ I)−1 is deﬁned everywhere.
6) If |λ| > 1, then it follows from the above that (T −λ I)−1 is deﬁned everywhere. Now, T −λ I is
closed, so (T −λ I)−1 is also closed. Then it follows from the Closed Graph Theorem that λ ∈ϱ(T)
for every λ ∈C, for which |λ| > 1. Hence
σ(T) = σp(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1},
σr(T) = σc(T) = ∅,
and
ϱ(T) = {λ ∈C | |λ| > 1}.
Remark 2.1 This example shows that it is possible that every λ for which λ ∈C med |λ| = ∥T∥
belongs to the resolvent set, ϱ ∈ϱ(T). So far we have only seen examples, in which there is always
at least one λ ∈σ(T), such that |λ| = ∥T∥. This is not the case in the present example. ♦

Self adjoint operators
Example 3.1 Let T ∈B(H). Show that we can write T as
T = A + i B,
where A and B are uniquely determined, bounded self adjoint operators.
First assume that T can be written in the form T = A + i B, where A and B are self adjoint. Then
(Tx, y)
=
(Ax + i Bx, y) = (Ax, y) + i (Bx, y)
=
(x, Ay) + i (x, By) = (x, Ay −i By) = (x, (A −i B)y) = (x, T ⋆y) ,
and it follows that if
T = A + i B
then
T ⋆= A −i B.
We get by simple addition or subtraction,
A = 1
2 (T + T ⋆)
and
B = 1
2i (T −T ⋆) .
Conversely, if
A = 1

B = 1

then clearly, T = A + i B. Furthermore, A and B are obviously linear and
∥A∥≤1
2 {∥T∥+ ∥T ⋆∥} = ∥T∥,
∥B∥≤1
2 {∥T∥+ ∥T ⋆∥} = ∥T∥,
so A and B are bounded. Finally,

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.2 Show that T ∈B(H) is self adjoint if and only if one of the following conditions is
satisﬁed:
(Tx, x) = (x, Tx)
for all x ∈H,
and
(Tx, x) ∈R
for all x ∈H.
We assume implicitly that H is a complex Hilbert space.
We have T ∈B(H), thus T is self adjoint if and only if T ⋆= T, thus if and only if
(5) (Tx, y) = (x, Ty)
for all x, y ∈H.
Choosing y = x in (5) we get in particular the ﬁrst condition above, thus
(6) (Tx, x) = (x, Tx)
for all x ∈H.
This condition is equivalent with
(Tx, x) = (x, Tx) = (Tx, x)
(∈R),
and it follows that the two conditions are equivalent. It only remains to prove that (6) implies that
T is self adjoint.
Assume (6). We shall prove (5). We get by replacing x in (6) by x + y that
(T(x + y), x + y)
=
(Tx, x)
+(Tx, y) + (Ty, x)+
(Ty, y),
(x + y, T(x + y))
=
(x, Tx)
+(x, Ty) + (y, Tx)+
(y, Ty),
⋆
⋆
⋆
It follows from the assumption (6) that the three columns marked with a ⋆inside each column are
mutually equal. Hence by a subtraction and a rearrangement,
(7) (Tx, y) + (Ty, x) = (x, Ty) + (y, Tx).
If we write x + iy in (6) instead of x, then we get analogously,
(T(x + iy), x + iy)
=
(Tx, x)
−i(Tx, y) + i(Ty, x)+
(Ty, y),
(x + iy, T(x + iy))
=
(x, Tx)
−i(x, Ty) + i(y, Tx)+
(y, Ty),
⋆
⋆
⋆
We conclude as before by utilizing that the columns marked with a ⋆by the assumption (6) are
identical that
(8) (Tx, y) −(Ty, x) = (x, Ty) −(y, Tx).
We get by adding (7) and (8), followed by a division by 2,
(Tx, y) = (x, Ty).
This is true for all x, y ∈H, so we have proved (5), thus T is self adjoint.

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.3 Let S and T be bounded, self adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Show that ST + TS
and i(ST −TS) are self adjoint.
The proof is simple, because S, T ∈B(H) and
(ST + TS)⋆= (ST)⋆+ (TS)⋆= T ⋆S⋆+ S⋆T ⋆= ST + TS,
and
{i(ST −TS)}⋆= −i{(ST)⋆−(TS)⋆} = −i{T ⋆S⋆−S⋆T ⋆} = i(ST −TS).

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.4 Let T be a bounded self adjoint operator. Deﬁne the numbers
m = inf{(Tx, x) | ∥x∥= 1},
and
M = sup{(Tx, x) | ∥x∥= 1}.
Show that σ(T) ⊂[m, M], and show that both m and M belong to σ(T).
Show that ∥T∥= max{|m|, |M|}.
We deduce from the deﬁnitions of m and M that
m ∥x∥2 ≤(Tx, x) ≤M ∥x∥2
for all x ∈H.
Now, T ∈B(H) is self adjoint, so σ(T) ⫅R. Choose λ ∈R \ [m, M]. We shall prove that λ ∈ϱ(T).
First assume that λ < m. Then
∥(T −λ I)x∥2
=
(Tx −λ x, Tx −λ x)
=
(Tx −mx + (m −λ)x, Tx −mx + (m −λ)x)
=
∥Tx −mx∥2 + (m −λ)2∥x∥2 + 2{m −λ} (Tx −mx, x).
It follows from m −λ > 0 and (Tx −mx, x) = (Tx, x) −m(x, x) ≤0 that we have the estimate,
∥(T −λ I)x∥2 ≥0 + (m −λ)2∥x∥2 + 0 = (m −λ)2∥x∥2,
which implies that T −λ I is injective, and (T −λ I)−1 exists and is bounded. Then
λ ∈ϱ(T) ∪σr(T).
Because T is self adjoint, the residual spectrum is σr(T) = ∅, hence λ ∈ϱ(T).
If instead λ > M, then we get analogously
∥(T −λ I)x∥2
=
(Tx −λ x, Tx −λ x)
=
(Mx −Tx + (λ −M)x, Mx −Tx + (λ −M)x)
=
∥Mx −Tx∥2 + (λ −M)2∥x∥2 + 2{λ −M} (Mx −Tx, x)
≥
(λ −M)2∥x∥2,
because λ −M > 0 and (Mx −Tx, x) = M∥x∥2 −(Tx, x) ≥0. As before we infer that (T −λ I)−1
exists and is bounded. We have proved that C \ [m, M] ⫅ϱ(T), and it follows that σ(T) ⫅[m, M].
Using a well-known formula we get
∥T∥= sup{|(Tx, x)| | ∥x∥= 1} = max{|m|, |M|}.
Assume e.g. that ∥T∥= |M| = M ≥0, and let λ = M. Then
M ∈σp(T) ∪σc(T) ∪ϱ(T).
We shall prove that M /∈ϱ(T). This is done indirectly.

3. Self adjoint operators
Assume that M ∈ϱ(T), thus (T −M I)−1 ∈B(H). Then there exists a c > 0, such that
∥(T −M I)−1x∥≤1
c ∥x∥
for all x ∈H.
If we put y = (T −M I)−1x, then x = (T −M I)y, hence
∥(T −M I)y∥≥c∥y∥
for all y ∈H.
This implies that ∥T −M I∥≥c > 0.
From M = sup{(Tx, x) | ∥x∥= 1} follows the existence of a sequence xn, ∥xn∥= 1, of unit vectors,
such that
(Txn, xn) →M = ∥T∥
for n →+∞,
and we conclude from
(Txn, xn) ≤∥Txn∥· ∥xn∥= ∥Txn∥≤∥T∥= M,
that also ∥Txn∥→M. Then for every such sequence,
0
≤
∥(T −M I)xn∥2 = (Txn −Mxn, Txn −Mxn)
=
∥Txn∥2 + M 2∥xn∥2 −2M(Txn, xn)
→
M 2 + M 2 −2M 2 = 0,
which shows that the estimate ∥(T −M I)xn∥≥c∥xn∥= c > 0 is not true, and we have derived a
contradiction. Therefore, M /∈ϱ(T), i.e. M ∈σ(T).
An analogous argument shows that if ∥T∥= |m| = −m, then m ∈σ(T).
Finally, assume that |m| = −m < M. It follows from the above that M ∈σ(T). We shall prove that
also m ∈σ(T). First notice that T −M I of course is self adjoint. Then it follows from
((T −M I)x, x) = (Tx, x) −M ∥x∥2,
and
m ∥x∥2 ≤(Tx, x) ≤M ∥x∥2,
that
(m −M)∥x∥2 ≤((T −M I)x, x) ≤(M −M)∥x∥2 = 0,
and
inf{((T −M I)x, x) | ∥x∥= 1} = m −M < 0.
Then from the above, m −M ∈σ(T −M I), which means that
(T −M I) −(m −M)I = T −m I
is not regular, so m ∈σ(T).

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.5 Consider in L2(R) the operator Q deﬁned by
Qf(x) = x f(x),
with
D(Q) = {f ∈L2(R) | Qf ∈L2(R)}.
Show that Q is self adjoint.
Let f, g ∈D(Q), thus f, g ∈L2(R) and x · f(x), x · g(x) ∈L2(R). Because Q is densely deﬁned, we
get
(Qf, g) =
 +∞
−∞
x f(x)g(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
f(x) · x g(x) dx = (f, Qg),
proving that Q is symmetric, Q ⫅Q⋆. It remains to prove that D(Q) = D (Q⋆). To do this it suﬃces
to prove that Q is a closed operator.
Assume that (fn) ⊂D(Q) and fn →f ∈L2(R), and x fn →g ∈L2(R).
We shall prove that
g(x) = x · f(x) almost everywhere. We ﬁnd
∥g −x f∥2
2 =

|g(x) −x f(x)|2dx +
 −1
−∞
+
 +∞
1
|g(x) −x f(x)|2dx

.
Here,
 1
−1 |g(x) −x f(x)|2dx = 0, because f ∈L2([−1, 1]) implies that also x · f ∈L2([−1, 1]), noting
that the interval is bounded. This means that g(x) = x · f(x) for almost every x ∈[−1, 1]. If |x| ≥1,
then we get fn →f and fn →g(x)
x , both in the sense of L2, because

|x|≥1

g(x)
x

2
dx ≤

|x|≥1
|g(x)|2dx < +∞.
The limit value is unique, hence f(x) = g(x)
x
almost everywhere for |x| ≥1. Hence we conclude that
g(x) = x f(x) for almost every x ∈R.
This proves that Q is closed, which again implies by the above that Q = Q⋆, and we have proved that
Q is self adjoint.
Example 3.6 Show that the set of self adjoint operators is closed in B(H).
We shall only prove that if (Tn) ⊂B(H) is a sequence of self adjoint operators, converging towards
T ∈B(H), then T is also self adjoint. The condition Tn →T for n →+∞means that
Tx =
lim
n→+∞Tnx
for all x ∈H.
Therefore, if x, y ∈H, then
(Tx, y) =
lim
n→+∞(Tn, y) =
lim
n→+∞(x, Tny) = (x, Ty),
proving that T ⫅T ⋆. Because D(T) = H, we have T = T ⋆, hence T is self adjoint.

k |xk|2 ≤

(Tx, y) =
+∞

k=1
rkxkyk =
+∞

k=1
xkrkyk = (x, Ty),
proving that T is self adjoint. This implies that the residual spectrum is empty, σr(T) = ∅.
From Tek = rkek follows that every rk ∈σp(T), and we concluder further from 0 < rk ≤∥T∥that
∥T∥≥sup
k∈N
rk = 1,
hence ∥T∥= 1.

3. Self adjoint operators
Conversely, if Tx = λ x, then
Tx −λ x =
+∞

k=1
(rk −λ)xkek = 0,
so either λ = rk or xk = 0. This shows that
σp(T) = Q ∩]0, 1[ = {rk | k ∈N}.
Assume that λ < 0. Then
∥Tx −λ x∥2 =

(rk + |λ|)2 |xk|2 ≥|λ|2
+∞

k=1
|xk|2 = |λ|2 · ∥x∥2,
from which we infer that ∥Tx −λ x∥≥|λ| · ∥x∥, hence λ ∈ϱ(T). It follows that
ϱ(T) ⫆C \ [0, 1].
On the other hand, σ(T) is closed, so it follows from
σ(T) ⫆σp(T) = Q ∩]0, 1[,
that σ(T) ⫆[0, 1]. From ϱ(T) and σ(T) being disjoint we conclude that
ϱ(T) = C \ [0, 1]
and
σ(T) = [0, 1].
Now, σr(T) = ∅for self adjoint operators, and σp(T) = Q ∩]0, 1[, hence the continuous spectrum is
σc(T) = σ(T) \ σp(T) = ([0, 1] \ Q) ∪{0, 1}.
Example 3.8 Let (ek) be an orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space H, and assume that T ∈B(H) has
the matrix representation T = (tjk) with respect to the orthonormal basis (ek) (see Ventus, Hilbert
spaces, Example 2.7). Derive a necessary and suﬃcient condition on the tjk that T is self adjoint.
In Ventus, Hilbert spaces, Example 2.7 we derived that tjk = (Tej, ek), and

It follows from the above that T is self adjoint if and only if T⋆= T, i.e. if and only if
tkj = tjk
for all j, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Note that
tkj = (Tek, ej) = (ej, Tek) ,
so the example shows that in this case T is self adjoint, if
(Tej, ek) = (ej, Tek)
for all j, k ∈N,
and there is nothing new in that statement.
Example 3.9 Let H = L2(R), and let V denote a bounded real continuous function. We deﬁne the
operator T by
Tf(x) = V (x) · f(x),
f ∈L2(R).
Prove that T is a bounded self adjoint operator.
In Quantum Mechanics the operator T is called a potential operator.

We conclude that T ∈B(V ) and ∥T∥≤∥V ∥∞.
Utilizing that V (x) is real we see that

V (x)f(x) · g(x) dx =

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.10 Let H denote a Hilbert space. Introduce in the set of all self adjoint operators from
B(H) a relation ≤by
S ≤T,
if T −S ≥0,
cf. Example 6.1. Prove that ≤is a partial relation.
It follows from S −S = 0 ≥0 that S ≤S.
Assume that S ≤T and T ≤U, thus T −S ≥0 and U −T ≥0.
We shall prove that S ≤U, i.e. that U −S ≥0.
We have
((U −S)x, x)
=
((U −T) + (T −S)x, x)
=
((U −T)x, x) + ((T −S)x, x) ≥0.
This holds for every x ∈H, hence the claim is proved.
Example 3.11 Let H be a Hilbert space and let T ∈B(H) be positive and self adjoint.
Show that
∥(Tx, y)∥2 ≤(Tx, x) (Ty, y),
for all x, y ∈H.
We shall here be aware of two possible obstacles. First, (Tx, y) could be a complex number, and
secondly (Tx, x) could be 0, so we must never divide by (Tx, x).
Let x, y ∈H be given, and choose α ∈R such that
(Tx, y) = |(Tx, y)| eiα.
Using the assumption it follows for any λ ∈C that
0
≤
(T(λx + y), λx + y)
=
|λ|2(Tx, x) + λ(Tx, y) + λ (Ty, x) + (Ty, y)
=
|λ|2(Tx, x) + λ(Tx, y) + λ (y, Tx) + (Ty, y)
=
|λ|2(Tx, x) + 2 Re{λ(Tx, y)} + (Ty, y),
where we have used that T is self adjoint, hence
(Ty, x) = (t, Tx) = (Tx, y).
Choosing in particular λ = μ e−iα, μ ∈R, then
μ2(Tx, x) + 2μ|(Tx, y)| + (Ty, x) ≥0
for all μ ∈R.
All coeﬃcients are real, so the condition of the discriminant B2 −AC ≤0 holds, thus
|(Tx, y)|2 ≤(Tx, x) (Ty, y)
for all x, y ∈H,
and the claim is proved.

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.12 1) Let V denote a normed space. Show that
∥x −y∥≥| ∥x∥−∥y∥|
for all x, y ∈V.
2) Let T be a bounded, linear and self adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. Assume that T is surjective
and show that T is then injective.
3) Assume that T is a closed linear operator on a normed space X. Show that ker(T) is closed in X.
4) Let H denote a Hilbert space and assume that (xn) and (yn) are two sequences in the closed unit
ball of H such that (xn, yn) →1. Show that ∥xn −yn∥→0.
5) Let (xn) and (yn) denote two orthonormal sequences in a Hilbert space H, and assume that
∞

n=1
∥xn −yn∥2 < 1.
Show that if (xn) is an orthonormal basis, then so is (yn).
1) It follows from the triangle inequality that
∥x∥= ∥(x −y) + y∥≤∥x −y∥+ ∥y∥,
and analogously (or just by interchanging letters)
∥y∥≤∥x −y∥+ ∥x∥.

3. Self adjoint operators
By a rearrangement,
∥x∥−∥y∥
∥y∥−∥x∥

≤∥x −y∥,
hence
∥x −y∥≥| ∥x∥−∥y∥|.
2) We shall prove that if Tx = 0, then x = 0. We get for every y ∈H that
0 = (0, y) = (Tx, y) = (x, Ty).
From T being surjective follows that the image of T is all of H, so x is perpendicular to H, thus
x = 0, and T is injective.
3) Let T be closed, thus the graph G(T) is closed as a subset of X × X. Let (xn) ⊂ker(T) denote a
convergent sequence in X, i.e. xn →x. Then ((xn, 0)) ⊂G(T), and
(xn, 0) →(x, 0) ∈G(T) = G(T),
which shows that x ∈ker(T).
4) Here,
∥xn −yn∥2
=
(xn −yn, xnyn) = (xn, xn) −(yn, xn) −(xn, yn) + (yn, yn)
=
∥xn∥2 + ∥yn∥2 −2 Re {(xn, yn)} ,
and since all xn and yn belong to the unit ball, we have
0 ≤∥xn −yn∥2 ≤1 + 1 −2 Re {(xn, yn)} →2 −2 = 0
for n →∞,
proving that
∥xn −yn∥→0
for n →∞.
5) Let x ∈H be perpendicular to all yn. From (xn) being an orthonormal basis and (x, yn) = 0 we
get
x =
∞

n=1
(x, xn) xn =
∞

n=1
{(x, yn) + (x, xn −yn)} xn =
∞

n=1
(x, xn −yn) xn.
This implies the estimate, when we apply that (xn) is orthonormal and the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality,
∥x∥=
∞

n=1
|(x, xn −yn)|2 ≤
∞

n=1
∥x∥2 · ∥xn −yn∥2 = ∥x∥2
∞

n=1
∥xn −yn∥2.
It follows from the assumption that ∞
n=1 ∥xn−yn∥2 < 1, so the only possibility for this inequality
is when x = 0, hence x = 0 is the only vector in H, which is perpendicular on all yn. This shows
that (yn) is an orthonormal basis.

3. Self adjoint operators
Example 3.13 Let (xn) ⊂ℓ2 and deﬁne the sequence y = (yn) by
yn = xn+1 + n xn + xn−1,
where we put x0 = 0 whenever it is necessary.
1. Show that y ∈ℓ2 if and only if (n xn) ∈ℓ2.
Let
D = {x ∈ℓ2 | (n xn) ∈ℓ2},
and deﬁne a linear operator T : D →ℓ2 by Tx = y, where y is given above.
2. Show that D is dense in ℓ2.
3. Show that T is self adjoint.
1) It follows from
(yn) = (xn+1) + (n xn) + (xn−1),
and that ℓ2 is a vector space that if (xn) and n xn) ∈ℓ2, then (yn) ∈ℓ2.
If conversely (xn) and (yn) ∈ℓ2, then it follows from
(n xn) = (yn) −(xn+1) −(xn−1),
that (n xn) ∈ℓ2.

(n xn + λn yn) ∈ℓ2. Finally, it is obvious that T is linear.

The splitting of the sums in the second equality is legal, because each of the three series on the
right hand side is absolutely convergent by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Hence we conclude
that
T ⋆y = (yn+1 + n yn + yn−1) ,
thus D ⫅D (T ⋆), and T ⫅T ⋆, so T is at least symmetric.
It follows from the result of (1) that (yn+1 + n yn + yn−1) ∈ℓ2, when (yn) ∈ℓ2, if and only if
(n yn) ∈ℓ2. Hence D (T ⋆) = D, and T = T ⋆, and we have proved that T is self adjoint.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

Isometric operators
Example 4.1 Let T ∈B(H). An operator is called isometric if ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥for all x ∈H. Show
that the following conditions are equivalent for T ∈B(H).
1) T is isometric.
2) T ⋆T = I.
3) (Tx, Ty) = (x, y) for all x, y ∈H.
(3) ⇒(2). This is almost trivial:
(x, y) = (Tx, Ty) = (T ⋆Tx, y)
for all x, y ∈H,
thus T ⋆Tx = x for all x ∈H, and hence T ⋆T = I.
(2) ⇒(1). If T ⋆T = I, then
∥Tx∥2 = (Tx, Tx) = (T ⋆Tx, x) = (x, x) = ∥x∥2,
proving that T is isometric.
(1) ⇒(3). If T is isometric, we get as above,
(T ⋆Tx, x) = (Ix, x),
thus
((T ⋆T −I)x, x) = 0,
for all x ∈H. Then it follows from Example 1.8 in Ventus, Functional Analysis, Hilbert
spaces that T ⋆T −I = 0, if H is a complex Hilbert space, hence T ⋆T = I.
Example 4.2 Let T ∈B(H) be an isometric operator. Show that T(H) is a closed subspace.
Show that T(H) = H if H is ﬁnite dimensional.
Give an example of an isometric operator with T(H) ̸= H.
1) When T ∈B(H) is isometric, i.e. ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥for all x ∈H, then in particular T is injective, thus
T −1 : T(H) →H exists.
Put y = Tx. Then it follows from the above that
T −1t
 = ∥y∥, and T −1 is continuous (though
not necessarily deﬁned in all of H).
Now, H is closed, so T(H) =

T −1−1 (H) is also closed.
2) Let H be ﬁnite dimensional, dim H = n, and denote by {e1, . . . , en} a basis of H.
When T is isometric, then T is injective. In fact, 0 = ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥implies trivially that x = 0.
We claim that the images {Te1, . . . , Ten} of the basis vectors are linearly independent. Assume
that
0 = λ1Te1 + · · · + λnTen
(= T (λ1e1 + · · · + λnen)) .
The operator T is injective, so also λ1e1 + · · · + λnen = 0.
Here {e1, . . . , en} is a basis, so
λ1 = · · · = λn = 0. It follows that Te1, . . . , Ten are linearly independent, so n ≤dim T(H) ≤n,
thus dim T(H) = n. This is only possible, if T(H) = H, because T : H →H.

Then clearly T is isometric, ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥for all x ∈H, and
T(H) = {e1}⊥̸= H.

the Hilbert space H. Show that
T(M) = N

M ⊥

Show that T is isometric if and only if for any orthonormal basis (ek), (Tek) is an orthonormal
sequence.
Assume that T ∈B(H) is isometric, and let M and N ⫅H be closed subspaces, and assume that
T(M) = N. We shall prove that for every x ∈M ⊥and for every y ∈N we have that (Tx, y) = 0.
From y ∈N = T(M) follows that there exists a z ∈M, such that y = Tz, and then we get from
Example 4.1, (3) that
(Tx, y) = (Tx, Tz) = (x, z) = 0,
because x ∈M ⊥and z ∈M. It follows that T

M ⊥
⫅N ⊥.
Let (ek) denote an orthonormal basis, and assume that T is isometric. We get again from Exam-
ple 4.1, (3) that
(Tej, Tek) = (ej, ek) = δjk,
(Kronecker symbol), which shows that (Tek) is an orthonormal sequence. Of course (Tek) needs not
be a basis. An example is given in Example 4.2.
If conversely there exists an orthonormal basis (ek), such that (Tek) is an orthonormal sequence, then
Tx =

k=1
xkTek,
thus
∥Tx∥2 =
+∞

k=1
|xk|2 = ∥x∥2,
and T is isometric.
Remark 4.1 The answer of the latter question above shows that if there is just one orthonormal basis
(ek), such that (Tek) is an orthonormal sequence, then every orthonormal basis has this property. ♦

4. Isometric operators
Example 4.4 Let T ∈B(H) be an isometric operator. Show that TT ⋆is a projection and determine
its range.
Assume that T ∈B(H) is isometric. We shall prove that TT ⋆is a projection, i.e. TT ⋆must satisfy
the two conditions,
(TT ⋆x, y) = (x, TT ⋆y)
for all x, y ∈H,
and
(TT ⋆)2 = TT ⋆.
We get
(TT ⋆x, y) = (T ⋆x, T ⋆y) = (x, TT ⋆y) ,
and the ﬁrst condition is fulﬁlled. Then apply the result T ⋆T = I from Example 4.1, (2),
(TT ⋆)2 = TT ⋆TT ⋆= T (T ⋆T) T ⋆= TIT ⋆= TT ⋆,
and it follows that P = TT ⋆is a projection.
The range of the projection P = TT ⋆is given by Px = TT ⋆x = x, i.e. TT ⋆H. Now,
T ⋆(H) = T ⋆(H) = ker(T)⊥,
thus TT ⋆(H) = T

ker(T)⊥
. It follows from
H = ker(T) ⊕ker(T)⊥,
that
TT ⋆(H) = T

ker(T)⊥
= T

ker(T) ⊕ker(T)⊥
= T(H),
and the range is TH.
Example 4.5 Consider the Hilbert space L2([0, ∞)). Let h > 0 and deﬁne the operator T by
Tf(x) = 0
for 0 ≤x < h,
Tf(x) = f(x −h)
for h ≤x.
Show that T is isometric and determine T ⋆. Find TT ⋆and T ⋆T.
First notice that
∥Tf∥2

|Tf(x)|2dx =
 +∞
h
|f(x −h)|2dx =

|f(x)|2dx = ∥f∥2

which shows that T is isometric. Then it follows from Example 4.1, (2) that T ⋆T = I.

TT ⋆g(x) = Tg(x + h) =

5. Unitary and normal operators

Unitary and normal operators
Example 5.1 An operator T ∈B(H) is called unitary if it is isometric and surjective. Show that
the following conditions are equivalent for an operator T ∈B(H),
(a) T is unitary.
(b) T is bijective and T −1 = T ⋆.
(c) T ⋆= TT ⋆= I.
(d) T and T ⋆are isometric.
(e) T is isometric and T ⋆is injective.
(f) T ⋆is unitary.
(a) ⇒(b). Assume that T is unitary, thus T(H) = H, and ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥for x ∈H. Clearly, Tx = 0
implies that x = 0, so T is injective, and T −1 exists and is continuous with ∥T∥−1 = 1. (Sketch
of proof: Put y = Tx, etc.) From D

T −1
= T(H) = H, we even get that T −1 ∈B(H), and we
conclude that T is bijective.
Then it follows from Example 4.1, (2) that T ⋆T = I, and from the deﬁnition of T −1 we get
T −1T = I. Hence,
0 =

T ⋆−T −1
T,
thus

T ⋆−T −1
T(H) = {0}.
From T(H) = H follows that T ⋆−T −1 is identically 0 on all of H, thus T ⋆= T −1.
(b) ⇒(c). Assume that T is bijective and that T −1 = T ⋆. Then
T ⋆T = T −1T = I
and
TT ⋆= TT −1 = I.
(c) ⇒(d). Let T ⋆T = TT ⋆= I. It follows from Example 4.1, (2) that T is isometric. Then we
conclude from
(TT ⋆)⋆= (T ⋆)⋆T ⋆= I⋆= I,
that T ⋆is also isometric by Example 4.1, (2).
(d) ⇒(e). If T and T ⋆are isometric, then T ⋆is in particular injective.
(e) ⇒(a). Assume that T is isometric and that T ⋆is injective. We shall prove (a), so it only remains
to prove that T(H) = H.
Because T(H) is closed, it suﬃces to prove that if
(Ty, x) = 0
for all y ∈H,
then x = 0. We have
0 = (Ty, x) = (y, T ⋆x)
for all y ∈H.
When we in particular choose y = T ⋆x, then
(T ⋆x, T ⋆x) = ∥T ⋆x∥2 = 0,
thus
T ⋆x = 0.
Now, T ⋆is injective, so x = 0.

5. Unitary and normal operators
Summing up we have proved that (a)–(e) are equivalent. We shall only prove that we can add (f) to
this family of equivalent conditions.
(a) ∧(d) ⇒(f). If T is unitary, then T ⋆and T ⋆⋆= T are isometric, so T ⋆is unitary by (d).
(f) ∧(d)⇒(a). If T ⋆is unitary, then T ⋆and T ⋆⋆= Y are isometric, and T is unitary by (d).
Example 5.2 Let (ek) denote an orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space H and let T ∈B(H) be given
by

2

k=1
|λk|2 |xk|2 ,
that if |λk| = 1 for all k, then ∥Tx∥= ∥x∥, hence T is isometric.
If there exists a k, such that |λk| ̸= 1, then ∥Tek∥= |λk| ̸= 1 = ∥ek∥, and T is not isometric.
We have proved that T is isometric, if and only if |λk| = 1 for all k ∈N. We shall only prove that if
|λk| = 1 for all k ∈N, then T(H) = H, because this implies by Example 5.1 that T is unitary.
Let y ∈H, i.e.
y =

If there exists an x ∈H, such that Tx = y, then

5. Unitary and normal operators
so x ∈H, and Tx = y. This proves that T(H) = H, and it then follows from Example 5.1 that T
is unitary.
Example 5.3 Let T ∈B(H) be unitary. Show that
σ(T) ⊂{z ∈C | |z| = 1}.
Let |λ| ̸= 1. Because T is unitary, we get in particular that ∥T∥= ∥x∥, hence
∥Tx −λ x∥≥| ∥Tx∥−∥λ x∥| = |1 −|λ| | · ∥x∥.
It follows that (T −λ I)−1 exists for every λ ∈C, for which |λ| ̸= 1. We shall ﬁnish the proof by
showing that (T −λ I)−1 is densely deﬁnes in H, because then
ϱ(T) ⫆C \ {z ∈C | |z| = 1}
and
σ(T) ⫅{z ∈C | |z| = 1}.
Assume that (T −λ I)−1 is not densely deﬁned for some λ ∈C. Then there exists an y ̸= 0, such that
y ⊥(T −λ I)D(T −λ I) = (T −λ I)(H),
thus
0 = ((T −λ I)x, y) =

x,

T ⋆−λ I

y

= (x, 0)
for all x ∈H.
We conclude that T ⋆y −λ y = 0, hence λ is even an eigenvalue for T ⋆= T −1.
By Example 5.1, T ⋆is also unitary, thus |λ| = 1, and hence also |λ| = 1.
Then it follows by
contraposition that if |λ| ̸= 1, then (T −λ I)−1 is densely deﬁned. Then
ϱ(T) ⫆C \ {z ∈C | |z| = 1}
and
σ(T) ⫅{z ∈C | |z| = 1}.
Example 5.4 An operator T ∈B(H) is normal if
TT ⋆= T ⋆T.
Show that T is normal if and only if ∥T ⋆x∥= ∥Tx∥for all x ∈H.
If T ∈B(H) is normal, i.e. T ⋆T = TT ⋆, then
∥T ⋆x∥2 = (T ⋆x, T ⋆x) = (TT ⋆x, x) = (T ⋆Tx, x) = (Tx, Tx) = ∥Tx∥2,
and we conclude that ∥T ⋆x∥= ∥Tx∥for all x ∈H.
Assume conversely that ∥T ⋆x∥= ∥Tx∥for all x ∈H. Then
0 = ∥T ⋆x∥2 −∥Tx∥2 = (T ⋆x, T ⋆x) −(Tx.Tx) = (TT ⋆x, x) −(T ⋆Tx, x) = ((TT ⋆−T ⋆T) x, x) .
The space H is complex. so it follows that TT ⋆−T ⋆T = 0, hence T ⋆T = TT ⋆as required.

and the ﬁrst claim is proved.
It follows that λ is an eigenvalue for T (of eigenvector x), if and only if λ is an eigenvalue for T ⋆(the
same eigenvector x), thus
σp (T ⋆) = σp(T).
On the other hand, σr(T) ⫅σp (T ⋆) = σp(T), and because σr(T) and σp(T) are disjoint, we must
have σr(T) = ∅.

5. Unitary and normal operators
Example 5.6 Let H = L2([0, 1]) and consider the operator
Tf(x) =


x3
.
1) Show that T ∈B(H) and ﬁnd ∥T∥.
2) Show that T −1 exists and that T −1 ∈B(H).
Determine T −1g(y) for g ∈H, and ﬁnd
T −1.
3) Show that σ(T) ⊂{λ ∈C | |λ| = ∥T∥}.
1) The operator T is obviously linear.
Then by the change of variable y = x3,

|Tf(x)|2 dx =

3x2 f

|f(y)|2 dy = ∥f∥2
2,
hence T is isometric (∥Tf∥2 = ∥f∥2), thus T ∈B(H) and ∥T∥= 1.
2) We shall prove that the equation
Tf(x) = g(x),
g ∈L2([0, 1]),
always has a uniquely determined solution, thus T −1 : H →H. It follows by the deﬁnition that
we shall solve
Tf(x) =
√
3 x f

x3
= g(x).

Positive operators and projections
Example 6.1 An operator T ∈B(H) is positive if
(Tx, x) ≥0
for all x ∈H,
and we write T ≥0.
Prove the following:
1) T ≥0 implies that T is self adjoint.
2) If S, T ≥0, α ≥0, then S + α T ≥0.
3) If T ≥0 and S ∈B(H), then S⋆TS ≥0.
4) If T ∈B(H) then T ⋆T ≥0,
5) If T is an orthogonal projection then T ≥0.
1) Assume that T ∈B(H) is positive, i.e. (Tx, x) ≥0 for every x ∈H. Then
(T ⋆x, x) = (x, Tx) = (Tx, x) = (Tx, x) ≥0,
and T ⋆is also positive, and
((T ⋆−T) x, x) = 0
for every x ∈H.
Then assume that the vector space is complex. Then it follows that T ⋆−T = 0, i.e. T ⋆= T, and
we have proved that T is self adjoint.
2) This is trivial: For every x ∈H,
((S + α T)x, x) = (Sx, x) + α(Tx, x) ≥0 + α · 0 = 0.
3) It follows from Sx ∈H for every x ∈H that
(S⋆TSx, x) = (T(Sx), Sx) ≥0.
4) This is again trivial. In fact, for every x ∈H,
(T ⋆Tx, x) = (Tx, Tx) = ∥Tx∥2 ≥0.
5) Let T denote an orthogonal projection. Then
T ⋆= T
and
T 2 = T.
It follows from (4) that
T ⋆T = TT = T 2 = T
is positive, hence T ≥0.

Example 6.2 Let PM and PN denote the orthogonal projections of the closed subspaces M and N of

If M ⫅N, then
H = N ⊕N ⊥= M ⊕

which means that every element x ∈H has a unique decomposition
x = xM + xN + x⊥,
where xm ∈M,
xN ∈M ⊥∩N,
x⊥∈N ⊥.
Then
PMx = PM

xM + xN + x⊥

and
PNx = PN

xM + xN + x⊥

It follows that

hence PN −PM ≥0, and whence PM ≤PN.

6. Positive operators and projections
Example 6.3 An operator T ∈B(H) is called a contraction
∥Tx∥≤∥x∥
for all x ∈H.
Show that the following conditions are equivalent for an operator T ∈B(H):
1) T is a contraction,
2) ∥T∥≤1,
3) T ⋆T ≤I,
4) TT ⋆≤I,
5) T ⋆is a contraction,
6) T ⋆T is a contraction.
(1) ⇒(2). Let T ∈B(H) denote a contraction, thus ∥Tx∥≤∥x∥for all x ∈H. Then
∥T∥= sup{∥Tx∥| ∥x∥≤1} ≤sup{∥x∥| ∥x∥≤1} = 1,
and we have proved (2).
(2) ⇒(3). Assume that ∥T∥≤1. Then
((I −T ⋆T) x, x)
=
(x, x) −(T ⋆Tx, x) = ∥x∥2 −(Tx, Tx)
(9)
=
∥x∥2 −∥Tx∥2 ≥∥x∥2 −1 · ∥x∥2 = 0,
and we have proved that I = T ⋆T ≥0, hence T ⋆T ≤I, and we have proved that (3).
(3) ⇒(1). Assume that T ⋆T ≤I. By repeating (9) we see that ∥x∥2 −∥Tx∥2 ≥0, thus ∥Tx∥≤∥x∥,
and we have proved (1).
It follows from the above that the former three conditions (1)–(3) are equivalent.
(1) ⇔(5). If T is a contraction, then by (2), ∥T ⋆∥= ∥T∥≤1, and we infer that T ⋆is a contraction.
If conversely T ⋆is a contraction, then T ⋆⋆= T is contraction.
We have proved that the conditions (1)–(3) and (5) are equivalent.
(1) ⇔(4). If (1) is fulﬁlled, then also (3) and (5), and it follows that (5) is equivalent with
(T ⋆)⋆T ⋆= TT ⋆≤I,
and (1)–(5) are all equivalent.
(1) ⇒(6). If T is a contraction, then we have proved that ∥T ⋆∥= ∥T∥≤1, and it follows that
∥TT ⋆∥≤∥T ⋆∥· ∥T∥≤11 = 1,
thus T ⋆T is a contraction by (2), and we have proved (6).

6. Positive operators and projections
(6) ⇒(1). If T ⋆T is a contraction, then
∥T ⋆Tx∥≤∥x∥
for all x ∈H,
hence by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
∥Tx∥2 = (Tx, Tx) = (T ⋆Tx, x) ≤∥T ⋆Tx∥· ∥x∥≤∥x∥2.
We infer that ∥Tx∥≤∥x∥for every x ∈H, and T is by the deﬁnition a contraction.
We have proved that the six conditions (1)–(6) are equivalent.

Compact operators
Example 7.1 Let S and T be linear and bounded operators and assume that S is compact. Show that
ST and TS are compact.
According to the deﬁnition, S ∈B(H) is compact, if S(X) is compact for every bounded set X ⊂H.
Consider S, T ∈B(H), and let S be compact. If X is bounded, then T(X) is also bounded. In fact,
if
M = sup{∥x∥| ∥x∥∈X},
then
∥Tx∥≤∥T∥· ∥x∥≤∥T∥· M
for all x ∈X.
It follows that ST(X) = S(T(X)) is compact, hence the composite operator ST is compact.
Since T is continuous, it follows that TS(X) ⫅T

S(X)

. Now, S(X) is compact for every bounded
set X, and T is continuous, hence T

S(X)

is also compact. Now every closed subset of a compact
set is compact, hence TS(X) is compact, and the composite operator TS is compact.
Example 7.2 Let S and T be compact operators in B(H), and let α ∈C. Show that S + α T is
compact.
Denote by X a bounded set. Then S(X) and T(X) are both compact sets, because S and T are
compact operators. Choose any sequence (xn) ⫅(S + α T)(X). Then we can ﬁnd other sequences
(yn) ⫅X and (zn) ⫅X, such that
xn = Syn + α Tzn.
The set S(X) is compact, hence there exists a subsequence (ynj), such that Synj →y, and we obtain
the subsequence (xnj) by
xnj = Synj + α Tznj.
If α = 0, there is nothing to prove. If α ̸= 0, it follows by a rearrangement that
Tznj = 1
α xnj −1
α Synj ∈T(X).
The set T(X) is compact, so there is a subsequence (njk), such that Tznjk →z. This implies that the
subsequence

xnjk

is convergent,
xnjk = Synjk + α Tznjk →y + α z.
We have proved that any sequence (xn) from (S+α T)(X) has a convergent subsequence, hence(S + α T)(X)
is compact. Furthermore, X is any bounded set in H, so we infer that S + α T is compact.

7. Compact operators
Remark 7.1 This result shows that the set of compact operators in B(H) is a subspace of B(H).
Then it follows from the result of Example 7.1 that the subspace of compact operators is even a
so-called two-sided ideal in B(H) with the composition of operators as multiplication. ♦
Example 7.3 Let (ek) denote an orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space H, and deﬁne the operator T

thus ∥(T −Tn) x∥≤

n + 1 ∥x∥for all x ∈H, and we have proved that ∥T −Tn∥≤
1
n + 1, hence
∥T −Tn∥→0 for n →+∞. It follows that T is compact.
Then we check when Tλ = T −λ I is injective. It follows by recursion from

particular we get for the point spectrum σp(T) ⫅{0}. On the other hand Te1 = 0 = 0 · e1, thus 0 is

If μ ̸= 0, then
y1 = 0
and
yn = 1
nμ yn−1,
n ≥2,
and it follows by either induction or by recursion that y = 0, contradiction the assumption. We
therefore conclude that σp (T ⋆) = ∅. This implies that the residual spectrum for T is empty, σr(T) = ∅.
Remark 7.2 It is also possible here to ﬁnd σ(T) and σ (T ⋆), though this is not an easy task. For
completeness the derivations are given in the following.

that T ⋆is injective, so (T ⋆)−1 exists. Then from e1 ⊥T ⋆D (T ⋆) follows that (T ⋆)−1 is not densely
deﬁned. This means that 0 ∈σr (T ⋆).
It follows from T ⋆∈B(H) and T ∈B(H), that T ⋆⋆= T = T. We have already proved that
σp(T) = σp (T ⋆⋆) = {0}.
so it follows by contraposition that σr (T ⋆) = {0}. We have proved
σp(T) = {0},
σr(T) = ∅,
σp (T ⋆) = ∅,
σr (T ⋆) = {0}.
Then we claim that
(11) σc(T) = σc (T ⋆) = ∅.
First notice that if (11) holds, then it easily follows that
σ(T) = σ (T ⋆) = {0}
and
ϱ(T) = ϱ (T ⋆) = C \ {0}.

7. Compact operators
In order to prove (11) we shall need the following theorem:
Theorem 7.1 Assume that T ∈B(H) is compact, and choose λ ̸= 0. If Tλ = T −λ I is injective,
then the range (T −λ I)(H) is closed.
First assume that Theorem 7.1 holds. Let λ ∈σc(T). Then σp(T) = {0}, and because σp(T) and
σc(T) are disjoint, we must have λ ̸= 0. Then it follows from the deﬁnition of σc(T) that T −λ I is
injective and that (T −λ I)(H) is dense in H. Theorem 7.1 shows that (T −λ I)(H) is closed, hence
(T −λ I)(H) = H, and whence (T −λ I)−1 is bounded by the theorem of bounded inverse. This
means that λ ∈ϱ(T), contradicting the assumption that λ ∈σc(T). We conclude that σc(T) = ∅.
The proof of σc (T ⋆) = ∅is apart from a very small modiﬁcation exactly the same as that above. This
modiﬁcation is that we this time shall use that because σr (T ⋆) = {0}, we must have λ ̸= 0 for any
possible λ ∈σc(T). ♦
Proof of theorem 7.1. Let y = limn→+∞yn, where yn = (T −λ I)xn.
1) Assume that (xn) has a bounded subsequence. Because T is compact, there must exist another
subsequence (xni) such that the image sequence (Txni) is convergent. From follows
xni = 1
λ (Txni −yni) ,
that xni →x and y = (T −λ I)x, hence y ∈(T −λ I)(H), and we have proved that (T −λ I)(H)
is closed in this case.
2) Then assume that (xn) does not have any bounded subsequence. Then ∥xn∥→+∞. We deﬁne
zn =
xn
∥xn∥,
∥zn∥= 1,
thus (T −λ I)zn →0. There is a subsequence (zni), such that (Tzni) is convergent. However,

zni −1
λ Tzni

is convergent, so zni →z, where ∥z∥= 1 and (T −λ I)z = 0, contradicting that
T −λ I is injective. Hence the sequence (xn) must have a bounded subsequence, and we are back
in case (1) above, and the claim is proved. □
Example 7.4 Let T be a bounded operator on a Hilbert space H. Show that:
1) If T is compact, then T ⋆is also compact.
2) If T ⋆T is compact, then T is compact.
3) If T is self adjoint and T n is compact for some n, then T is compact.
1) Assume that T is compact. Let X be a bounded set, and let (yn) ⫅T ⋆(X) be any sequence, thus
there exists a sequence (xn) ⫅X, such that yn = T ⋆xn.
We shall prove that there exists a subsequence

xnj

, such that

T ⋆xnj

is convergent. This is
done indirectly. Assume that T ⋆is not compact. Then there exists a bounded sequence (ϕn),

7. Compact operators
which converges weakly towards ϕ, such that (T ⋆ϕn) does not converge strongly towards T ⋆ϕ,
thus there exist a subsequence (fn) and an η > 0, such that
∥T ⋆fn −T ⋆ϕ∥> η
for all n ∈N,
hence
η ≤∥T ⋆fn −T ⋆ϕ∥≤∥T ⋆∥· ∥fn −ϕ∥
(< M),
and whence
∥fn −ϕn∥≥
η
∥T ⋆∥.
Now, (T ⋆fn −T ⋆ϕ) is bounded and it converges weakly towards 0, hence TT ⋆fn converges strongly
towards TT ⋆ϕ, i.e.
η2 ≤∥T ⋆(fn −ϕ)∥2 = (TT ⋆(fn −ϕ) , fn −ϕ) ≤∥TT ⋆(fn −ϕ)∥· ∥fn −ϕ∥→0
for n →+∞. This gives a contradiction, η > 0 being ﬁxed, and our assumption that T ⋆is not
compact, must be wrong. We therefore conclude that T ⋆is compact as claimed above.
2) It follows trivially from Example 7.1 that if T is compact, then T ⋆T is also compact.
Assume that T ⋆T is compact, and also assume (thus an indirect proof) that T is not compact.
Then there exists a bounded sequence (ϕn), which converges weakly towards ϕ, such that (cf. (1))
∥Tϕn −Tϕ∥≥η
for all n ∈N.
Because (ϕn −ϕ) is bounded and weakly convergent, it follows that (T ⋆Tϕn −T ⋆Tϕ) is strongly
convergent, and we get
η2
≤
∥T (ϕn −ϕ)∥2 = (T (ϕn −ϕ) , T (ϕn −ϕ))
=
(T ⋆T (ϕn −ϕ) , ϕn −ϕ) ≤∥T ⋆T (ϕn −ϕ)∥· ∥ϕn −ϕ∥
≤
∥T ⋆T (ϕn −ϕ)∥· M →0
for n →+∞,
which is a contradiction, because η > 0 is a given constant. We therefore conclude that T is
compact.
3) Finally, assume that T is self adjoint, T ⋆= T , and that T n is compact for some given n ∈N.
If n = 2m is even, then it follows from T being self adjoint that
T n = T 2m = (T m)⋆(T m)
is compact. Then we infer from (2) that T m is compact, where m = n
2 < n.
If instead n = 2m −1 is odd, then
T n+1T nT = T 2m = (T m)⋆(T m)
is compact, cf. Example 7.1, and we infer as above that T m is compact, where m = n + 1
2
< n,
when n > 1.
By recursion we get after a ﬁnite number of steps that T 3 is compact, and hence that T 2 = T ⋆T
is also compact, which by (2) implies that T is compact.

thus ∥T∥≤1.
On the other hand,
∥Te1∥= ∥e2∥= 1 = ∥e1∥

∥Te2∥= ∥e1∥= 1 = ∥e2∥,
so ∥T∥= 1, and T ∈B

2) Because T ∈B

hence T = T ⋆, and T is self adjoint.

4) Because T is self adjoint and compact, we can apply the main theorem, thus
σp(T) = {λn | n ∈N}.
Now Tx = 0 implies that x = 0, hence 0 /∈σp(T), which means that σc(T) = {0} and σr(T) = ∅,
because T is self adjoint.
The eigenvalue problem Tx = λx, λ ̸= 0, is now written in coordinates
