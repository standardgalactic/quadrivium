What is drawing? Traditionally, it has been regarded 
as a secondary art – a preparatory stage for painting  
or sculpture, or a purely technical skill. These 
notions, however, ignore the vast creative potential  
of drawing as a means of exploring content, process, 
and analytical skills. Happily, this potential is now 
being realized, and drawing is experiencing a massive 
resurgence in contemporary art and design practice. 
There are two main reasons for its renewed 
popularity. First is accessibility. You don’t need 
expensive equipment or materials to make a drawing, 
and your work can be quick to execute and easy to 
review and revise. Often, it is the capacity for 
spontaneous expression – ideas distilled to their very 
essence – that makes drawing so compelling, but it is

also – conversely – a medium capable of being 
detailed, elaborate, and expansive. Second is diversity. 
Drawing practice takes in everything from classical 
still life drawing and landscape to advanced digital 
manipulation and abstract expression; it encompasses 
analytical pencil drawing, gestural charcoal 
portraiture, as well as exuberant oil pastels that have 
many of the qualities of oil painting. Indeed, it could 
be argued that no other form of graphic expression is 
so versatile. Understanding the wide range of ideas  
and processes in drawing will help you advance your 
drawing practice beyond basic ideas and traditional 
conventions. You will be able to make drawings that  
are not just competent, but truly interesting. 
A question of intent
To make interesting drawings, you must first identify 
your intentions. What is your subject? How will you 
draw it? And, perhaps most importantly, why will  
you draw it? Reflection and research – scouring the  
world around you for visual inspiration, recording  
and developing ideas in a sketchbook – are the 
cornerstones of all revealing work. Once you have 
decided on your subject and your purpose, you need

INTRODUCTION

to match it with a suitable process. Consider the 
properties of your subject that you wish to reveal;  
for example, a simple bunch of flowers has many 
descriptors, such as natural, colorful, textured, fresh, 
and ephemeral. Choosing which to explore, and in 
which media, will give your activity a clear purpose. 
Try new processes; at first, some will not work, but 
they will still flex the self-critical part of your brain 
and help you develop an analytical framework – 
essential if you are to progress to an advanced level.  
The final chapter of this book looks at contemporary 
devices that allow you to explore content and process 
in progressive ways – precisely the ways that are 
expanding the territory of drawing in today’s society. 
What sets these contemporary practices apart from  
the historic roots of drawing is that there now exists  
a whole generation of artists for whom drawing is the 
primary activity. They have revitalized this ancient art, 
and recaptured the magic of pure, direct imagery in an 
era when images are ubiquitous and often superfluous. 
The aim of this book is to inspire your practice, and 
give you the means to contribute to the new wave of 
drawing, but above all to help you enjoy the simple  
act of making marks on paper.

Introduction|


Preparation

 
Drawing is rightly associated with freedom of  
self-expression, but even so, you cannot draw without 
some kind of tool to extend the eye and hand. The 
fundamental tools of drawing are the simplest and  
most portable – pencils, pens, and brushes – and it  
is worth spending the time to find which are suited  
to your interests and temperament. This will help you 
define and develop your own unique style of drawing.

preparation
Pencils, pens, and brushes
Working with pencil
The most commonly used drawing tool is the 
“lead” pencil – which is not actually made of lead 
but soft carbon graphite mixed with clay. Each 
grade makes a mark of a certain density; try them 
all to experience the quality of each grade. Larger 
sticks of graphite, not encased in wood, provide a 
broader point, and can be used on their side for 
covering large areas of tone or creating wide lines.
Graphite qualities  Vigorous directional marks made with a dark, 
soft graphite stick appear sooty and soft-edged, yet still convey 
tremendous energy; the graphite medium infuses interest into  
this otherwise static still life. 
Erasers of soft putty or hard plastic are not just for rubbing out your 
mistakes, but are drawing tools in themselves. Sharpeners or craft 
knives will give your graphite a fine drawing edge. 
Composed of pigment and clay, colored pencils are 
impregnated with wax to help hold the color to the drawing 
surface and prevent smudging. Colored pencils don’t mix 
and so are made in a vast range of shades. 
Marks made  Smooth strokes and 
sensitive use of colored pencils can 
emulate the soft but intense colors 
of nature.

Pencils and graphite sticks are graded from 9H, the hardest, to 9B,  
the softest. Drawings can be made with a single graded pencil or  
a combination of several grades.

Pencils, pens, and brushes|
working with pen
Modern pens are readily available and are 
convenient to use in the field, as shown in the 
busy, spontaneous landscape below. Preloaded 
with ink and manufactured to consistent 
specifications, they make marks of predictable 
quality, though are available only in a narrow range 
of colors. Quill and dip pens need a separate ink 
source and make more haphazard marks. 
Technical and consumer pens make fine 
marks of constant width and quality; the 
width of the tips of technical pens is given  
in millimeters. Ballpoint and felt-tip pens  
are useful for spur-of-the-moment sketches.
working with inks
Inks can be applied with both brushes and nibs. Ink 
applied with a brush makes fluid calligraphic marks; 
drawing brushes are typically round and pointed, in 
contrast to the flat types used in oil painting, and are 
made from natural animal hair or synthetic fibers. 
Dip pens create characterful lines and can use almost 
any type of ink; fountain pens with an internal reservoir 
cannot be used with most Indian inks. 
Yellow liquid 
acrylic
Types of ink  Inks and liquid acrylics, which 
can be used in a similar way to inks, are 
available in a huge range of colors and can 
be mixed together to achieve almost any hue. 
Inks may be water-soluble or waterproof; 
India inks gain their waterproof qualities 
through the addition of shellac. Water- 
soluble inks can be “released” with water 
after they are dry to achieve tonal washes.

pen to the consistent fountain pen.

Soft drawing materials, such as charcoals and pastels, 
are capable of laying down broad areas of line and tone 
in both monochromatic and color drawings, making 
them particularly good for larger scale works. Colored 
pastels were very popular with the Impressionists who 
referred to their use as “dry painting.” Their colors  
can be bold and brilliant – the word “pastel” does  
not imply paleness of tone.

Willow charcoal sticks
preparation
Charcoal and pastels 
using Charcoal
Charcoal is usually made from willow vine or 
beech charred at a very high temperature. It can 
be readily erased and smudged allowing you to 
leave many traces in the drawing that reveal the 
mark of the hand that made it. Energetic, 
expressive drawings work well in this medium,  
as do images that require a wide range of broad 
strokes to depict large tonal areas.
Seal head  This drawing uses charcoal in a variety of ways: a few linear 
strokes indicate the surface of the water; broader, darker tonal areas 
describe the head; and rubbing back helps define the animal’s reflection. 
Fixative is made from resin 
dissolved in a colorless spirit 
solvent and usually sold in spray 
can form. It has a strong smell 
and is best used in a ventilated 
area. Fixative plays an important 
part when drawing in charcoal  
or pastel. It can be sprayed onto 
your work at regular intervals 
throughout the process, enabling 
you to fix areas of your drawing 
while it is in progress. It also acts 
as the final sealing layer for the 
preservation of your drawing. 
Charcoal drawing tools  Willow charcoal is a brittle, powdery, and very 
tactile medium. Bound into a pencil or compressed – where charcoal dust  
is mixed with fine clay and a binder – it becomes more intense and more 
permanent. Charcoal can be smudged and dispersed with a fingertip or 
using a rubber-tipped shaper.   
Charcoal marks  
Fluid, vigorous, and 
smudged marks are the 
key drawing components 
of most charcoal works.

Textured paper is a suitable 
ground for pastel drawing 
because its “tooth” can hold  
the loose pigment. This simple 
drawing shows how effectively 
two tones – dark brown and 
white – can describe an image  
on a colored ground.  
 
Developed in the 1700s, these pastels are defined by their traditional 
earthy colors, such as sanguine, terracotta, and sepia.
Based on an oil or wax binder, these pastels 
produce thick, buttery marks reminiscent of 
oil paints. They can be used on oil painting 
paper and dissolved by adding turpentine  
to create soft and smudged color fields. 
They do not require treatment with fixative. 
The wooden pencil-like casing of these soft chalky pastels makes them 
ideal for precise linear work, and for developing detail in a bigger drawing, 
especially in conjunction with larger chalk pastel sticks.
Colored Pastels
Pastels were developed in the 16th century, and 
their name comes from the French pastiche, 
meaning “mixture” or “paste.” To make soft pastels, 
pure pigment is ground to a paste with a gum 
binder, then rolled into sticks. Other types of 
pastels are made by altering the nature of binder 
and quality of pigment used. Softer pastels tend  
to be encased in paper to preserve their integrity. 
These pastels are a relatively new innovation. 
They contain a water-soluble component, 
such as glycol, which allows the colors to  
be released with a water wash to create a 
diffuse, ink-like quality in the drawing.
These pastels are made up of limestone with added pigment. They are tonally lighter than 
pure pigment pastels, offering you a subtle range of soft colors to work with. They require 
a fixative to prevent smudging.

Charcoal and pastels

Paper is manufactured in an astonishing variety of 
weights, colors, textures, and finishes. Cheap, basic 
papers – ideal for quick sketches – are usually  
machine-made and based on wood pulp. They tend  
to degrade, becoming yellow and brittle. Art papers, 
based more on cotton and linen fiber, and made by 
machine or by hand, provide better drawing surfaces 
and archival qualities, though are more costly. 
Paper
types of paper
Light, smooth papers are well-suited to delicate, 
detailed pencil work, but when working with 
mixed media, tonal graphite, or inks, it pays to 
choose a thicker ground. This will absorb any 
dampness, preventing buckling and wrinkling,  
and can be worked and erased more vigorously. 
Paper weight is expressed as weight (grams) per 
unit area (square meter); standard watercolor 
paper is around 300 gsm (grams per square meter) 
compared with office paper, which is 80 gsm.

preparation
Drawing papers  Basic drawing 
papers are available from hundreds 
of different paper mills. They are 
ideal for line work. 
Decorative papers  Small patterns 
on decorative paper can act as a 
backdrop to a bolder, stronger 
drawing laid on top; they can be 
used in collage or as underlay for  
a coat of gesso. 
Heavy art papers  With a toothed 
surface, these robust papers are 
good for broad work in pastel and 
charcoal. The texture of the paper 
holds the crumbly pigment, 
enriching color or tone.

surface interactions
The surface of a drawing paper affects the quality  
of the marks made on it. Specialized pastel papers are 
coated with pumice powder or cork particles that hold 
the colored pigment. Conversely, some hand-made 
Charcoal on a rough textured paper will cling to the high ground of  
the paper and create a grainy drawing.
Colored pastel on a soft textured paper can be blended to produce  
solid areas and subtle tones and shadows that appear to glow. 
Fiber-tip pen imparts an even layer of ink to a heavy but smooth 
drawing paper, which can then be loosened with water.
Ink applied with a brush to a smooth paper flows evenly; when dry,  
it imparts its own raised texture to the surface.
papers have a satin finish so that a drawing medium, 
such as a fine pen, can glide over the surface without 
snagging. Others deliberately have inclusions, such as 
fibers or dry flowers, which affect the marks made.

alternative papers
Unusual or specialized papers can broaden your creative 
horizons. Drawing on transparent acetate, for example, 
allows you to make marks that can be laid over other 
drawn or found images, while tracing paper can help  
you to lift elements from other images and incorporate 
them into your drawing. Envelopes, bus tickets, and 
postcards can all be drawn over, the essence of the 
ground contributing to your composition. 
Gridded papers  Square or isometric 
graph paper sets out a template that  
can be followed or subverted.  
Experiment with paper  The ground is 
as important as the medium in creating 
your desired effect.

Paper |

Collecting ideas and visual references should be  
an ongoing activity for any artist. Think of your  
sketchbook as a visual diary – a place to make quick 
drawings from the world around you, and collect 
thoughts that will inform your future work. Take  
it with you wherever you go, pasting in text, images, 
and textured papers and objects to build up your  
own personal library of inspiration. 
Drawing research
sketchbooks and folios
The sketchbook is a place to “play” and experiment 
without fear (even van Gogh’s sketchbooks 
contained “mistakes”). Sketchbooks come in many 
forms and sizes; the cheapest notebook will do, 
but many artists prefer to use books made up of 
fine drawing papers. A thrifty alternative is to 
select the papers on which you like to draw and 
have them comb-bound into a book.

preparation
loose paper sketches
You learn to draw through making mistakes; to 
make lots of mistakes, you need to make lots of 
drawings. Get into the habit of drawing whenever 
you can, on whatever surface is available – there’s 
no substitute for trial and error. 
Everyday stationery  The rough surface 
and buff color of this stationery works well 
to support the immediacy of ball-point pen 
drawings. 
Wrapping paper  Patterned 
wrapping paper creates a 
lively rhythmic support for  
a colorful pastel drawing.
Buy the book  Your sketchbook is your friend, whether  
it is an expensive marbled volume or a simple pad. 
Small portfolios  These folders are very useful for 
collating and keeping loose themed sketches.

Drawing research|
using sketchbooks
There is no right or wrong way to use your 
sketchbook. Some artists use them principally 
to experiment with drawing processes, others 
to record their observations, much as a 
Travel sketchbook  There is a long tradition among  
artists for recording journeys as visual diaries. Use your 
sketchbook to record fleeting moments and expressions;  
paste in souvenirs and visual references that represent 
aspects of the place or culture you are engaging with.

initiate and develop ideas for a specific 
project. Many keep several sketchbooks, 
each related to a different theme.

pages of this sketchbook 
combine magazine

Drawing requires your full attention, so minimize 
distractions by carefully preparing your working 
environment. Whether you are working on a wall,  
at an easel, or on a tabletop, make sure your space  
is well-lit, and that you have enough room to move 
freely. It also pays to experiment with the media you 
have chosen to become familiar with their particular 
mark-making characteristics.  
Preparing to draw
materials at the ready
Gather together your research notes and sketches, 
and lay out all the materials you are likely to need 
for your drawing session. You may find that the 
ritual of laying out your tools will help to focus 
your mind on the job in hand. Your drawing tools 
should be sharp and clean; keep them close at 
hand, organized by type – so that pastel pencils  
are separated from graphite, for example. 
correc t perspective 
Drawings of buildings are vulnerable to distortion 
caused by the working position. Created on an easel, 
this large-scale drawing displays correct perspective.
If the finished drawing is viewed on a table, it seems  
to recede; when working seated, you will naturally 
compensate for this recession, creating distortion.    
|
20
preparation
Drawings smaller than A3 
(11.7x16.5 in) size can 
comfortably be completed 
while you are seated at a desk; 
larger drawings should be 
made standing, with the paper 
attached to an easel or a wall.  
This will enable you to reach 
all parts of the drawn area 
without stretching, giving you 
full control over the marks you 
make, and also eliminate any 
distortion introduced by the 
low viewing perspective  
when drawing seated.

making your mark
The sensitivity of mark making affects the 
character and energy of a drawing. You will 
gradually develop your own repertoire of mark 
making styles through trial, error, and experience, 
and the reward will be greater freedom in your 
drawing practice. Whenever you buy new 
drawing tools, test the precise quality of their 
marks, and assess their suitability for your style. 
pastel and pen marks
Rolling a pastel stick across the paper 
leaves an uneven, almost organic mark,  
very well suited to drawing natural forms. 
Pushing a pastel across the surface leaves 
a tapered mark that can imply recession into 
the distance away from the point of origin. 
Cross-hatching with an ink pen creates an 
even yet lively tonal surface. Repeated passes 
can represent the densest shadows. 
Swift rhythmic movements with the edge of 
a pastel suggest energy and pick out the high 
ground of the paper, adding surface interest. 
Dragging a pastel swiftly across the 
surface produces a dynamic mark suitable 
for applying broad swathes of tone.

Coastal scene  
A variety of pastel 
mark marking 
techniques has been 
used in this highly 
charged drawing, 
which captures a 
range of textures and 
directional dynamics.
Brush drawing with ink leaves a clear, 
precise, and fluid line with no jagged edges 
– perfect for gestural drawings. 
Used on its side  
in bold, horizontal 
strokes, pastel 
quickly evokes a  
dark sea horizon. 
Wild shrubbery is 
described though a 
collection of twisted

Strong horizontal 
inward strokes lead 
the viewer’s eye

Getting the proportions of a subject right, and 
correctly representing the relationships between 
objects, are fundamental to the success of any 
representational drawing. This is particularly true  
of life drawing, where errors in the basics become ever 
more noticeable as the drawing progresses. Measuring 
and mapping before drawing is not essential, but it 
will help you avoid many lengthy redraws. 
Measuring and mapping
measuring the human form
You don’t need a ruler to measure the proportions 
of your subject. A simple technique is to use a 
pencil, held at arm’s length from your eye, to 
measure the length of the model’s head, from  
the top of the crown to the base of the chin.  
This head-length then becomes the basic unit of 
measurement for all parts of the body, for example,  
a standing figure is around seven heads high. 
frameworks for the body
Draw two axes at right angles, and  
plot the positions of key points – 
joints of limbs – relative to the axes. 
Check the distances of joints 
and limbs both from your axes 
and from one another.
|
22
preparation
Hold up a pencil with your arm extended fully. With one eye closed, line up the tip  
of the pencil with the top of the model’s head; use your thumb to mark the bottom  
of the chin. Be sure to take any further measurements from exactly the same spot. 
Transfer your measurement to your 
drawing; you can use a similar 
technique to measure angles too. 
Use multiple faint lines to build 
up the scaffold of the body and 
find its form. 
Once you are sure of the sizes 
and relationships of the elements, 
strengthen the lines. 
using a pencil to map proportions

relationships and composition
Whether you are working with a model or a still 
life, the placement of your subjects on the paper 
is key to success. Closely analyze which part of  
a subject lies in front of or overlaps another – 
things are not always as they seem at first glance. 
Measure relative sizes with a pencil, and check 
this on the paper by looking closely at the negative 
spaces that emerge between items and forms – are 
they the right shapes? Use convenient verticals to 
check angles within the drawing. 
23
| 23
Measuring and mapping|
Still life  Placement  
of objects close to the 
edges of the paper 
creates the illusion that 
they are protruding from 
the plane of the drawing. 
Foreshortening  Accurate measurement is particularly 
important when dealing with the reclining – and therefore 
highly foreshortened – human form. Keep checking the 
relationships between elements as you draw. 
Directional marks make 
the vertical shading of the 
background distinct from 
the horizontal marks used 
for the foreground. 
Vertical and horizontal 
elements in the scene – 
here a table – are a 
useful reference for 
assessing angles and 
relative positions. 
Negative space  This deceptively simple drawing 
explores complex planar relationships. Examining  
the negative spaces between the elements enables 
you to unravel the jumble of elements.

Landscape
“The classic scene, the city, 
and the imagined paradise 
all provide rich inspiration.”

 
Perspective (from the Latin word for “to see”) is a 
formal system for representing three-dimensional 
objects on a flat surface in a way that appears natural 
to the viewer. It is an illusion in which objects are 
drawn ever-smaller as their distance from the 
observer increases, and straight-edged objects are 
distorted according to geometric principles to make 
them appear realistically three dimensional. 
Perspective
points of view
The use of perspective is best demonstrated with 
simple rectangular blocks. The front face or edge 
of the block is drawn first; its other lines are then 
added so that they recede from the viewer and 
gradually approach one another – just as they 
seem to do when you look at a real object. If 
extended beyond the object these receding  
lines eventually meet at “vanishing points.”
one-point perspective
|
26
landscape
One-point perspective is used to show forms that are face-on to 
the viewer; there is a single vanishing point on the high horizon. 
Placing the horizon low in the drawing creates the impression 
of looking up at an object in one-point perspective. 
In some drawings, the vanishing points may be off the page; 
construction lines may still help with building the image.

two-point perspective
Two-point perspective depicts an object at an angle. There is 
one vanishing point for each set of parallel lines in the object.

Perspective|
Axonometric drawing  Ignoring the  
foreshortening effects of perspective can 
result in an axonometric drawing, where 
verticals and horizontals are drawn to 
scale regardless of their distance from 
the viewer. The technique is widely used 
by architects. 
Complex perspective  Impressive 
depictions of the built environment 
can be made with a good 
understanding of perspective. 
the development of perspective
Geometric perspective as used today was 
developed in Italy in the early 1400s, when 
Renaissance artist Filippo Brunelleschi painted 
the outlines of buildings on to mirrors, and 
observed that all the lines converged on the 
horizon. Before this innovation, the main method 
of showing distance was to overlap forms, which 
made for very poor architectural drawings. 
The structure of the building 
is completely revealed in this 
axonometric projection.
Theory into practice  Piero della Francesca, the Renaissance mathematician 
and artist, based his works on his theoretical studies of perspective. 
Strong one-point perspective 
gives the image striking depth. 
The drawing is combined with 
a photographic image to give 
a real sense of place. 
Axonometric drawings allow 
architects to measure directly 
from the drawing, knowing that 
the scale is correct. 
Partial transparency 
reveals the structure 
of the building. 

Before the advent of linear perspective, artists used 
color to suggest scale; bright figures and objects were 
read as being close, and therefore important  
in the composition. Color, combined with formal 
perspective, still plays a vital role in establishing 
depth. Color has a direct psychological effect on  
the viewer in which warm colors appear to advance, 
while cooler blues and greens appear to recede. 
Color in space
advancing and recessive colors
Color combinations can create or subvert the 
illusion of depth and space. The two pastel 
drawings below are identical in composition.  
The upper drawing has a strong sense of relief 
while the lower drawing becomes a flat abstract 
pattern without obvious dimensionality. The 
difference lies exclusively in the choice of  
color and positions of tones.

Perspective  Warm hues 
of progressively lighter tone, 
topped with cool blue in a 
contrasting palette, create  
a strong illusion of depth. 
Subverting illusion 
Absence of contrasting color 
tends to flatten an image, as 
does using color out of tonal 
sequence (right). 
Blue is a strongly 
recessive color.
Mid-tones occupy 
the middle ground. 
Strong, saturated 
hues appear to 
advance in the

The tone of the

foreground, helping 
flatten the image.
Stronger hues, when 
placed out of tonal 
sequence, compromise 
the illusion of depth. 
Pale color tends to 
be recessive.

color as subject
For pre-Renaissance artists, color was 
used to ascribe spiritual value  
to a subject; prized pigments, such as 
ultramarine, vermillion, and gold were 
used not for decorative effect, but to 
directly reflect God’s glory. This highly 
symbolic use of color created its own 
order within the work. Many recent 
artists too have focused on color as 
the subject of their work; a notable 
example is the American artist Mark 
Rothko, whose non-representational 
color compositions are charged  
with emotion.

Color in space|
The absence of linear perspective is no barrier to creating an 
illusion of depth. A hierarchy is conjured up in this medieval work by  
the use of warm red and skin tones against recessive blues and violets. 
Layers of colored pastel give 
depth to this abstract 
composition; textures implying 
solidity contribute to the reality 
of this invented space. 
Background figures are the same  
size as those in the foreground. 
Clear iconic images send a 
direct religious message. 
Blue appears 
recessive, even  
in abstract 
composition. 
The importance of figures in medieval 
art was reflected in the cost of the 
pigments used to depict them. 
Red verticals  
appear to push 
forward from the 
plane of the paper. 

The illusion of depth created by linear perspective 
and reinforced through the use of color can be 
further enhanced by compositional sleight of hand. 
The frame that a drawing sits within is not just an 
embellishment, but presents another plane to the 
viewer and defines the positive and negative spaces 
within the piece. Frames created within the drawing 
will similarly influence the perception of depth. 
Composition and illusion
internal frames 
Take some time to study a scene before 
establishing your viewpoint. Natural frames – 
such as a doorway, window, a gap in foliage, or 
even a shadow cast by an object – will launch  
the eye on an imaginary journey to the back  
of the drawing. Reference points – objects 
encountered along this journey – establish 
successive planes within the drawing.

The space beyond  An open door is a clear cue to explore 
beyond the foremost plane of this drawing. Three further 
planes established by the table, the column, and the 
recessively-colored foliage create the illusion of a  
real physical space.  
Japanese ink drawing  A clear frame in this drawing is 
established by the bare branches of the birch tree in the 
foreground. The road, which narrows towards the horizon, 
eventually vanishing into the misty background, reinforces 
a sense of movement through a scene.  

framing and presentation
Mounting and framing a drawing will protect it 
from damage and enhance its presentation, but 
also plays a role in defining the meaning of the 
work. A cut mount placed over a landscape is 
literally a window on to the world you have 
depicted and so naturally imparts a further sense 
of perspective. The difference a mount can make 
is evident in the drawings below.

but requires a little practice and good tools.  
You will need a cutting mat, a steel ruler, and  
a specialized cutter with its blade at a 45° angle.

This drawing is an exercise in one-point perspective (see p. 26) in which 
dynamic mark making is used to evoke a powerful architectural structure. The 
starting point is a photograph of an art deco building, taken from a deliberately 
low viewpoint to inject strong perspective into the composition. The building’s 
form emerges from tone rather than line detail and the drawing is not intended 
to be overly representational; the tone is created through the bold use of 
graphite sticks and pencils.

SKETCH THE COMPOSITION
Lay a sheet of tracing paper over your photograph and draw 
over the building’s key outlines with the 3B pencil. The tracing 
distills the lines that create perspective and is a useful 
reference when you begin your drawing.  
Mark out the the vertical walls and key horizontal elements  
of the building with the 3B pencil. Refer frequently to your 
photograph and to your tracing of its key outlines – it is 
important to get the perspective right before you start to  
add tone to the drawing. Use a ruler for the straight lines.
Traced verticals 
converge, giving 
perspective.

for tough, solid forms.”

Continue mapping out the principal 
horizontal lines in the composition 
using the ruler for the straight edges. 
Indicate the positions of the windows 
along the vertical lines with faint  
dashes. Put your reference tracing  
to one side and begin working directly 
– and much more freely – from the 
original photograph. 
Establish the curved forms of the building’s tower with the 6B 
graphite stick. Draw the curves smoothly, pivoting your wrist from 
where it rests on the paper, using your hand like a compass. Rub 
out the vertical pencil guides that extend above the building to 
clearly delineate the areas that need to be shaded.  
Try not to get bogged down in detail – 
the essence of graphite drawings is 
laying down the correct densities of tone. 
tone in graphite 
Begin adding tone with the 6B 
graphite stick. Work with light 
pressure, following the shape of the 
building with the movement of the 
graphite: use curved shading marks 
for curved structures and vertical 
marks for upright elements.

Sketch in the outlines of the clouds 
and start to add heavier shading to 
define form in the building. Darken 
the shadow areas beneath the roof 
and around the columns.  
Work heavily with the 9B graphite 
stick to lay down tone in the densely 
shadowed parts of the building. Use 
the side of the graphite – there’s a 
large area to cover with tone. 
Darken the reflection in the lower 
window with the 6B graphite stick; 
rub back the window frames with a 
fine eraser – such as one on the end 
of a pencil – to accentuate contrast. 
Build up layer upon layer of tone, and keep re-establishing  
line detail. Decide when the graphite is as dark as it needs to 
be, then selectively rub back areas with the plastic eraser; this 
subtractive process brings out the reflective quality of the 
surface – almost impossible by using only additive processes.  
Use bold graphite marks to re-establish the outline  
of the building and to introduce details – such as the 
railings along the balcony. Create prominent lines 
that stand out from the overall tone of the
drawing to give an immediate sense of depth.

Both line and tone in this drawing have been built up by applying 
and then rubbing back the graphite medium. This repeated 
process is the only way to create a richness in the graphite 
drawing that effectively alludes to the complexity of real forms. 
Add soft, filamentous lines into the sky areas with the 
9B graphite stick. Rub in and blend the marks, using 
your fingertip to create the wispy edges of the cloud. 
Use stronger, directional lines to indicate the darker sky 
– there’s no need to be rigidly representational here. 
Reinforce the lines of the window frames using the 
sharpened 3B pencil. Smudge and blend tone, and  
take tone away, using the plastic eraser – carefully 
control the pressure to lift the tone selectively. Use  
the dirty plastic eraser to add smoky tone into the 
window areas to suggest the reflections of cloud.

Playing with the relationship between drawing and illusion, this whimsical project 
echoes the decorative silhouettes and vignettes of the Victorian period. Executed 
in water soluble blue ink, it relies on spontaneous gestural lines to portray a 
Venetian scene. Layered crosshatching depicts solid form, while wash applied 
with a brush provides a watery tone consistent with the subject matter. The 
drawing is finished by a decorative “frame” stenciled onto the paper with  
a colored pastel, giving the impresssion of a porthole into a romantic age.

Sketch the Venetian scene working

Use light, gestural lines; make 
multiple marks until you are happy 
with the basic outline. Note how 
the repetition of vertical forms – the 
prow of the boat and the lighthouse 
– creates the illusion of distance. 
Make the stencil. Use the HB pencil 
to draw an oval shape, about 8in 
(20cm) across its long axis, onto the 
thick cardboard. Embellish the top 
and bottom of the oval by drawing 
around a fluted plate. Cut out this 
shape with a knife, then trace around 
it onto the paper to make the stencil.

Begin to draw over the pencil outline. Start with the fine 
ink pen – a fine line can always be made heavier, but a 
thick line is there for good. Keep your hand loose – you 
are using the pen as a drawing, not writing, tool.  
Map out the horizon and the 
distant buildings, still 
working with the fine pen; lift 
the pressure on the pen to  
create wispy lines that  
imply distance. Begin to add 
shading to the interior of the 
boat, initially using evenly 
spaced parallel lines.  
Draw the figure of the gondolier, allowing the lines to 
wander a little to capture the dynamism of the pose. Pay 
careful attention to the weight distribution in the body – 
remember that the gondolier is pushing against the pole.

Continue shading the boat and figure with directional lines 
– vertical for upright elements like the legs, and diagonal  
for the torso, to suggest motion. Start building denser tone 
in the boat by crosshatching the darker shadow areas. 
Draw the water using S-shaped string-like marks  
to represent the way in which the water eddies  
in the wake of the boat, and short wavy horizontals  
to represent the wavefronts.

Make horizontal marks to add tone  
to the background. Use the fine ink 
pen, and keep the lines well spaced. 
The lighter background that results 
will appear to be recessive in the 
finished drawing.  
Gradually build up layer upon layer  
of crosshatching at different angles 
– a technique sometimes called 
“haystacking” – to darken both  
the boat and figure, which  
appear as near-silhouettes. 
Add the densest tones using the 
medium ink pen, filling in only 
the deepest shadows completely 
with ink. Selectively leave 
highlights to show the direction  
of incident light. 
Widely-spaced lines 
show shadow and form

Apply the water wash to the 
figure and the boat. Don’t 
soak the brush – the ink is 
very soluble and releases 
easily. Aim to retain some  
of the surface texture of the 
crosshatching, rather than 
creating a solid, uniform 
block of tone.
Wet a fine sable brush  
with clean water and begin 
painting the wash over the 
background marks to release 
the pigment from the ink. 
Work along the lines of 
hatching, not across them, so 
that the color diffuses gently, 
giving a faint misty effect. 
When working with a fine pen, 
choose a paper surface that is firm 
and smooth: the tip of the pen 
should not snag on any bumps.

Apply the wash to the water areas. Follow the swirling  
S-shapes with the tip of the brush, releasing color from 
the ink to create a translucent quality in the water. Allow 
the wash to dry for 30 minutes.  
Use a plastic eraser to remove most of the pencil 
outline. Retain faint traces of the pencil at the 
top, bottom, left, and right of the drawing so  
that you can accurately position the stencil. 
Carefully line up the stencil  
with the remaining pencil marks. 
Work around the stencil heavily 
with the ocher chalk pastel. 
Keep the edge of the stencil 
pressed flat onto the paper. 
Work with the side of the pastel 
stick to quickly fill the area around 
the stencil with flat color. Do not  
allow colored dust from the pastel 
to get under the stencil – it will 
bleed into the picture area. 
Rub the pastel with your 
fingertips to blend the color. Work 
away from the edge of the stencil 
outward. Carefully blow the 
excess pastel dust away from the 
stencil. 
Pressing hard on 
the pastel next to 
the stencil creates 
a crisp edge.

Gently lift the stencil from the 
drawing, ensuring that the pastel 
dust does not fall on to the 
image. Spray the drawing with  
a fixative to prevent the pastel 
from smudging.

This colorful creation of a tropical scene is pure artifice, compiled from several 
different reference sources rather than a single photograph. The drawing is all 
about form, rhythm, and color, and is made up only of lines produced with water 
soluble crayons. The lines emphasize the curved, sensual shapes of the natural 
forms and separate them from one another. Using water to release pigment in  
the final stage of the drawing creates interest in the surface texture, and is  
always exciting for its unpredictable effects.

SKETCH  THE COMPOSITION
Collect reference for the drawing from books and magazines; 
look for bright, rich, inspirational colors consistent with the 
tropical theme. Sketch some compositions using the colored 
crayons – the drawing relies so heavily on the relationships of 
colors. It helps to think about elements occupying layered 
planes in the drawing so that contrasts between colors  
and levels of detail can be used to convey perspective. 
Draw the outlines of the main forms with an HB pencil. 
Adjust the composition, accounting for the fact that the 
reference photos were taken from different angles and under 
different lighting conditions. Begin working over the outline 
of the large flower to the right with the olive green crayon. 
Variations in the 
pressure of the

Use the lavender blue crayon to map out the principal  
lines of the blue flowers. These flowers constitute the 
background of the drawing, their recessive colors focusing 
attention on the red and magenta foreground flowers.
Draw the plant stems that join together the magenta 
flowers with the tip of the olive green crayon. Keep 
the presure firm at first, then release it to taper the

into the outline of a flower and then draw over the pencil 
line with the sea blue crayon.  
Rub out your pencil underdrawing with the 
plastic eraser once you have captured the

Begin adding color to the petals using  
the lavender blue crayon. Examine and 
exaggerate the structures inherent in the 
natural forms. Start with a few key curved 
lines, and then gradually add more lines  
in between to build the forms. 
Outline the leaves with the emerald green crayon. Add their 
midribs to create a vertical dynamic in the drawing that 
contrasts with the curved forms of the flowers; combining 
linear and rounded shapes adds to the sense of space.

Use the emerald green crayon to color the leaves. Draw 
each line guided by the rhythm and form of the adjacent 
line; this gives the drawing a momentum of  
its own, inspired but not enslaved by the natural shape.  
Use the cadmium red crayon to start filling in the 
flower outlined with olive green. Apply heavier pressure 
on the crayon to pull the flower forward; note how the 
lines provide both the color and the tonal qualities. 
Intersperse the cadmium red lines with 
lime green and use olive green to add 
richness and density to the darker 
center of the flower. Work hard to 
inject more detail into this foreground 
flower; this makes it appear more 
prominent in the drawing. 
Strengthen the lines of the magenta 
flower to match the intensity of the red

will then appear to sit in the same,

Objects
“Still life remains one  
of the principal genres  
of Western art.”

The ultimate subject of most drawings is light. Its 
color, direction, and intensity shape the way that 
forms appear and contribute to the atmosphere of a 
drawing. Some artists favor the subtlety of natural 
light – Giorgio Morandi, one of the finest still life 
artists of the 20th century, worked only at certain 
times of day – while others make use of the drama 
and consistency of artificial light. 
Light and matter
LIGHTING THE SUBJECT
It pays to think as carefully about how you light  
your subject as the nature of the subject itself. 
Experiment with light from different angles, 
making sketches that show the effects on form  
and shadow. Choose a medium that is suited to 
the light quality and the surface of the object – 
charcoal is good for soft, diffuse light, pencil for 
translucency, and ink for dark shadow. 
|
52
objects
Flat lighting produces no shadows; the 
colored background provides form by 
pushing the figure forward.   
Natural side lighting produces subtle 
shadows and a pleasing three-dimensional 
quality; the blue color contributes to the 
solidity of the form. 
Strong side lighting 
creates a dramatic and 
solid rendering of this 
classical bust. Attention  
to detail – for example,  
the highlights in the hair 
and beard – bring the 
drawing to life. 

SHADOW and tone
There’s no rule to state that you must draw an 
object’s shadow – if it is omitted, the result is  
a flat, graphic description. But the shadow cast 
by an object will help create a sense of context, 
framing its edges and grounding it within the 
surroundings. Shadows also set out new areas  
of space within the drawing – for example, the 
area beneath a table or an armchair. 
53
| 53
Light and matter|
A full range of tonal values, from 
clear, bright highlights to dense 
shadow, produces a drawing with  
plenty of surface interest and apparent 
depth. If tones are shifted toward the 
extremes the result is a high contrast 
drawing that has less surface detail, 
but more drama and power. 
Reflection and translucency
Glass and metallic objects – especially those 
with curved surfaces – have complex interactions 
with light and their surroundings. Space becomes 
distorted, so don’t trust your assumptions; 
concentrate and closely examine the subject. 
Always begin with an accurate outline of the 
form – you need to be sure that proportions 
and outlines are all correct before shading. 
Distorted reflections require 
you to suspend your imagination 
and draw what you see. It often 
helps to faintly map out the 
principal areas of dense shadow 
and highlight – the extremes –
before tackling the mid-tones. 
Glass and metal objects are 
defined by the way in which they 
reflect and refract light, rather than 
by their surface color or texture. 
Drawing these objects requires 
careful observation and precision 
because the tonal values must be 
very accurate to create a realistic 
sense of depth and form. A sharp, 
hard pencil is an ideal drawing tool. 

 
The way you place an object within its surroundings 
will shape the meaning of a drawing. You can choose 
to isolate the object from its environment, focusing 
attention on its form and surface qualities, or locate  
it within a scene that invites the viewer to explore.  
The media, and the quality of the marks, also set  
the pitch of a drawing – whether it informs, moves, 
or challenges the viewer on an intellectual level. 
Space, media, and expression 
Different Media
Every medium has its own qualities – for example,  
colored pencil makes delicate marks, while ink 
and brush creates fluid, gestural lines. Clarify your 
intentions before deciding upon your media – do 
you want to make a drawing that is analytical, 
emotional, allusive, or descriptive? However, trust 
your intuition; there’s nothing to stop you making 
an emotionally-charged image in pen and ink.

Mixed media – a combination of ink, gesso, and pastel – create an 
expressive, colorful, gestural drawing that deliberately plays with space 
and depth to emphasize a sense of exuberance.
Pen and ink is well suited to this detailed study of a grasshopper. Fine 
lines capture the intricacy of surface detail, while empty space around 
the insect focuses attention on the bold rendering of the central form.
Colored pencil – used for this study of Brussels sprouts drawn centrally 
on toned paper – allows for fine detail and a degree of decorative 
expression in both line and tonal work. 
media for analysis and emotion

gestural drawing
There are many ways to translate the observed 
on to paper without being representative.  
Gestural drawing does not set out to create  
a facsimile of the object, but tries instead to 
suggest its essential feeling; it is concerned  
with the process of drawing itself as much as 
the subject depicted. Perhaps the best analogy 
is to visualize describing the object with your 
hands as you talk – your gestures are akin to 
those you make when gesture drawing.

Space, media, and expression|
This drawing in colored pencil possesses a real sense of depth; 
rhythmic placement of the objects and a colored ground create an 
open environment that the eye can explore. 
Relationships between objects
When preparing to work with a group of still-life 
objects you should experiment with different 
arrangements. The relationships between forms 
are defined both by the placement of objects and 
the negative space between them; these factors 
will influence the emotional pitch of the 
drawing. Compare the two drawings below:  
in the first, your eye is led backward through
the spaces between the stones; in the second,  
it gravitates toward the central structure. 
With the objects closely linked in a block form at the center of the 
drawing, the eye is confined to their surfaces and does not explore 
beyond the objects. The result is a solid, monumental composition.
Rivers of negative 
space become part 
of the composition. 
Negative space frames 
the composition  
of objects.
The economy of quick 
structural lines evokes 
the transparency of 
this object.
Deft lines and blocks 
of ink unite strong 
forms and rhythmic 
patterns.
Ink applied with a brush is a 
free medium well suited to these 
gestural drawings of everyday 
household objects. 
Quick and 
deliberate marks 
clearly define 
the shape of

it allows for both intimate and analytical explorations of form.

G Grouped forms 
Classical studies of grouped objects explore the effects  
of light on form, and heighten skills of analysis and 
draftsmanship. This soft, blended pencil study creates a 
tangible sense of solidity in the objects; with white objects 
against a white background, the subtlest tonal work holds  
the forms of the objects. C. Cobbett, Norwich School of Art

Combining different media is exciting because there’s every chance that you’ll 
produce a drawing that is far more than the sum of its parts. In this project, 
grayscale tone in pencil and graphite is mixed with colorscale tone in red chalk 
pastel. The result is a surface rich in texture and color that is ideally matched to 
the subject – a pair of red suede shoes made up of curved, fluid forms. Working 
successfully in mixed media requires constant reassessment – adding one element 
may demand counterbalancing with the other, and vice versa.

Make a series of lines with 
the 2B pencil, keeping 
your eyes on the shoes, 
not the paper. Hold the 
pencil loosely, and attempt 
to “find” the ouline of the 
shoe. Try not to be too 
analytical at this stage – 
think of this process as 
touching the object rather 
than examining it. 
Continue looking at the 
shapes of the shoes, mapping 
their outlines with multiple, 
faint lines. There’s no need to 
measure distances formally, 
but do keep reassessing the 
spatial relationships between  
the shoes.

Draw the looped forms of the laces 
and decorative flowers, and then pick 
out and strengthen the lines that 
carry the form of the shoes with the 
softer 4B pencil. Rub back your faint 
working lines with the plastic eraser. 
Rest your hand on a sheet of paper 
to avoid smudging the existing lines. 
Begin adding gray tone with the graphite sticks 
– use the 2B stick for the finer, more detailed 
areas, and the softer 6B for the broader areas.  
Think in terms of distinct areas of tonal value 
and faintly draw the contours of the different 
tones before shading.
Shade lightly at first, then build  
up the darker tones. Apply heavier 
shadow beneath the shoes; change 
the direction of the shading, using 
both hatching and curved directional 
marks for interest.

Some makes of pastel are chalky; others 
sticky. The former are better for smudging, so 
find the one that’s best suited to your style.
smudging pastel
Smudge the red crayon with your index 
finger. Spread the pastel just a little at first 
so that you can evaluate the placement and 
quality of the color. Follow the shapes of 
the shoes as you smudge, using your finger 
as a drawing implement. Be sure to blend 
the pastel into the paper – you need to 
press it in well because the pastel will be 
drawn over later with graphite, so should 
not be too loose. 
Roughly build up the correct densities  
of color. Don’t worry if you go over the  
pencil boundary line: energy is more 
important than neatness in this drawing.  
Color one shoe at a time using the cadmium red pastel stick. Move across 
the shoe from left to right (or right to left if you are left-handed) to prevent 
unwanted smudging. Keep the crayon marks loose; the tone will be 
established later by blending with your fingertips. Blow excess pastel 
powder away from the drawing (blowing from above the red shoe): the 
powder marks the paper, producing a faint red glow around the shoes.

“Familiar objects, invested  
with personality, make  
great subjects.”
Use the stronger hue of red – Windsor red –  
to work over the blended pastel in selected 
areas. Build up layers of pastel to match the 
intense, deep red color of the nap of the 
suede. The cadmium red acts as an undercoat 
for the Windsor red, eliminating any whiter 
areas and making the color glow. 
Working roughly, apply Windsor red over the 
tone on the inside of the shoe. The drawing 
process is like a seesaw, because it involves 
adding tone and color, then taking it away,  
always responding to what emerges. 
Start rubbing back the color with your index finger; allow yourself  
to smudge a little beyond the shoes’ edges because this helps to frame 
them and gives them dimensionality. Keep a little unevenness, rather 
than making the pastel completely smooth, to hint at the roughness 
of the suede fabric.

Using the plastic eraser, take away excess shading 
from around the shoes and rub back the clear 
areas between the straps. Leave some red marks  
in the highlights so they retain tonal interest. 
Return to the line components of the drawing, which have 
been obscured by the application and blending of color. 
Reinforce these outlines with the 6B graphite stick to  
bring them forward.

Work across the whole drawing  
from left to right, adding to the 
grayscale tone using the 6B 
graphite stick for broader areas, 
and the 5B pencil for finer tonal 
details. Closely analyze the gray 
tonal values compared with the 
red and adjust as necessary; 
pause every few minutes and  
be self-critical – the balance 
between the media is crucial  
to the success of this piece.
Pick out the line details of the  
decorative flowers on the shoes 
using the 5B pencil. Work 
expressively but attentively,  
and make sure to sharpen  
the pencil regularly. 
Use the sharp cadmium red  
pencil to color the floral details 
in the shoes. Draw  
the detail accurately and  
finely to bring the flowers 
forward in the drawing.  
Use the fuschia deep pastel 
stick to add stronger color to the 
margins of the flowers; this lifts 
them above the tone and texture 
of the shoes. Ensure that all 
areas of white are covered.

H The red shoes
A balanced relationship between the pastel 
and graphite marks has produced a dynamic 
still life. Traces of the working processes – 
smudges beyond the objects – inject  
an element of urgency into  
the finished drawing. 
Continue adding tone to the 
insole using the 6B graphite 
stick. Notice that gray tone is 
placed both below and over the 
red – it is this that gives the 
surface its solidity of form. 
Lift tone to create highlights 
using the plastic eraser. Work 
with the eraser in a slightly 
different way, sliding it across 
the surface to blend and  
soften the lines.
Apply more Windsor red to the 
front parts of the shoe and the 
laces. Return with the eraser to 
rub back excess line, tone, and 
color, and smudge the surface 
to give an even finish.

This study mixes pastel drawing with collage techniques and an application of  
gesso to create a textured, faintly colored ground that accentuates the vibrant, 
organic nature of the subject. Energetic, rather than formally analytical, the 
method used invites you to engage directly with the subject – a bunch of exotic 
flowers in a bottle-green vase, simply lit with one spotlight. Fluidity of movement 
and boldness when using the pastels are key to a dynamic drawing; try working   
accompanied by your favorite music – it helps you stay relaxed.

setting out the collage
Lay down the collage papers on the watercolor base sheet: 
wrapping paper, origami paper, and even old envelopes are 
suitable. Roughly match the composition of the collage with 
the position and color of elements in the subject. 
Glue the collage papers firmly to the base sheet with the 
paper adhesive, using your pencil marks as guides. Use a  
decorator’s brush to coat the entire surface of the paper with 
gesso, working it to mirror the forms of the flowers – the 
brushmarks persist and add texture to the finished drawing.

Allow the gesso to dry for 3–4 hours. 
The form of the collage papers will 
be faintly visible beneath. Begin 
drawing with the chrome green 
vibrant pastel to establish the shape 
of the glass vase; mark in the water 
line and the lip of the vase. 
Map out the shapes of all the 
richly colored flowers. Use  
the Madder Lake deep pastel  
to outline the large red lily, the 
cadmium orange pastel for the 
gerberas, the lemon yellow 
pastel for the yellow lilies, and 
the Prussian blue pastel to trace 
the outline of the white lilies. 
Start drawing the foliage with the lent 
green pastel. Note how the pastel 
picks up the irregular texture of the 
gesso to suggest a leafy surface. Rub 
back the green pastel with a fingertip, 
then apply more pastel to build up 
areas of color. 
A mixture of chalk and acrylic polymer, 
gesso is used to “prime” surfaces so they 
hold pigment. It provides a flexible, white 
drawing surface.

Repeat the previous step using cadmium orange to color the 
gerbera. Work heavily with the pastel to boost intensity 
rather than being overly concerned with line detail, which 
will come later. This is where the quality of your materials 
really shows: using chalk pastels that are soft and rich in 
pigment enhances the vibrancy of the drawing.
Use darker green pastels – the chrome green deep and  
dark olive – to add depth to the foliage. Don’t hold the  
pastel too rigidly like a pencil, and try consciously to “walk” 
up the stems, rolling, pushing, and pulling the pastel 
following the natural curves of the leaves. 
Begin building up tone in the flowers within the principal 
oulines that you have set out. Use the Madder Lake deep 
pastel to shade in the large red lily; mark out the position  
of its spadix (the long flower-bearing structure at the center 
of the red petal-like spathe). Rub the pastel back with your 
finger to blend together the tones.

Use the chrome green vibrant, lent green, and turquoise 
blue pastels to depict the water and submerged leaves. 
Smudge and blend with your fingertips to create an 
impression of watery translucency; build the intensity  
of pastel from the bottom of the vase to imply depth.

Return to the large red lily and lay down a heavier layer  
of the Madder Lake deep pastel over the existing line and 
tone, blending with your fingertips. Building tone in layers 
in this way adds richness and complexity to brightly 
colored foreground objects.  
Use the gray-green pastel to color the ash green 
leaves. Create a surface behind the leaves, and 
soften the harsh white of the paper, by using  
your fingertip to drag some color across the  
leaf outlines into the background. 
Vigorously drag pigment from the vase and 
stems outward into the background area  
using several fingers. Dragging pastel across 
the edges of the collage paper emphasizes  
the form of the underlying collage, which  
then contributes to the composition.  
Work within the blue outlines of the white lilies 
with the white pastel. Using the pastel, drag some 
of the blue color into the white petals, following 
the form of the veins of the flowers; this provides 
surface interest in the pure white lilies.
“Rubbing back and 
selectively rebuilding 
layers of pastel creates  
atmosphere.”

Re-examine the form of the red lily, looking closely at 
where shadows fall on the flower.  Use the dark gray 
pastel to add this detail – work with the edge of the  
pastel to produce a finer, more controllable line.  
Use the dark olive pastel to re-establish the outlines, 
contours, and shadows of the yellow, orange, and white 
flowers. This helps to throw the flowers in front of the 
softer blended pastel background.  
Add richness to the red lily with the Windsor red pastel, 
and use the cadmium orange pastel to color the spadix. 
Use the white pastel for highlights: these bring the lily 
to life as they catch the ridges on the waxy spathe.
Blend the highlights following the organic forms of the 
flower. Use the dark gray and white pastels to refine  
the shadow and highlight areas on the submerged  
stems. Blend and smudge to add realistic relief. 

 Flowers in a vase
In the finished drawing, the edges 
of the collage paper are still 
visible, giving an extra textural 
dimension – a layered effect that 
suggests different planes of the 
leaves and flowers. Starting with 
the collage is an interesting 
exercise because it gives you 
something to react to, other than 
just the subject, and so injects a 
new, arguably more personal, 
element into your drawing.

Crosshatching is a sensitive way of defining tone and three-dimensional form  
in pen and ink drawings. The technique allows you to create tone by varying  
the frequency of line – the closer together the lines, the darker the impression. 
Crosshatching is used not just in drawing but also in etching and engraving – 
traditional techniques where the lines can be even more delicate. This project 
captures some of the qualities of old engraving, using sepia pens – softer and  
more appealing than harsh black on white – to render a classic still life 
composition made up of bottles, jugs, and jars.

• Crosshatching to

• Capturing highlights 
and shadows
Use the 2H pencil to lightly mark out the shapes and relative 
positions of the objects and the key shadows that ground 
them. Measure the dimensions as necessary (see p. 22) as  
you map out the composition – it is important to get this  
right now as your later ink marks will be hard to correct. 
Work over the pencil outline with the B ink pen. Try to  
be loose with the line, varying its strength and width; this 
helps give the objects character from the outset. Break  
the flow of the line in places to add further interest to  
the drawing.

Using the 2H pencil, map out the 
areas where reflective highlights  
fall; when you start shading with  
the crosshatch technique, you’ll 
need to work fast.
Start adding tone, using the M ink pen. Work on one object 
at a time – you should aim to maintain the continuity of 
each line. Make penstrokes in one direction only, and keep 
the frequency of lines more or less even, so you are not yet 
suggesting large differences in tone. 
Draw a horizontal line to indicate the back edge of the table. 
Shade the background, making lines in the same direction as 
those used for the objects; keep the tonal density even. 
Work boldly to inject energy into the drawing. Lines 
that spill over the edges of an object are not a 
problem – the background will be shaded later.  
“Think about this drawing as a 
map of different tonal areas.”

Begin making lines at right angles  
to the existing shading, still using 
the M pen. Vary the frequency of 
the lines to establish areas of 
different tone, which helps to  
create the illusion of form.
Continue crosshatching, working  
on one object at a time. When you 
arrive at a delineated highlight area, 
start your penstroke on the edge of 
the highlight and work away from it, 
to keep the area bright. 
Keep evaluating the tonal densities 
of the objects as you go. Ensure that 
you are making creative decisions 
all the time; don’t be tempted to 
think that you are merely “filling in” 
the crosshatching.

objects 
When crosshatching, you can create denser tone by 
increasing line frequency, adding more layers of lines, by 
pressing harder, or by using a thicker point to your pen. 
controlling density
Now switch to the F pen. Begin reinforcing and bringing 
out the lines within the drawing, and add more fine 
crosshatching to the shadow areas: at this point the 
drawing should gain real depth.  
Build density in the darker areas of the subject by 
adding further passes of crosshatching at different 
angles. Turn the paper on its side so that you can make 
marks with natural, flowing movements of your hand. 
 

12
Continue refining tone and building 
line with the finest S pen. Allow the 
crosshatching to spill over at the 
bases of the objects into areas where 
the shadow is intense – this helps to 
ground the objects on the surface. 
H Jars and jugs
Crosshatching lends itself perfectly to this 
still life composition, where surface and 
reflection are the true subjects of the drawing. 
Very subtle differences in tone are achieved by 
varying the frequency and strength of the lines. 


Figure
“The human form offers 
an endless source of 
inspiration for its beauty 
and its character.”

 
Figure drawing has been the gold standard of artistic  
skills since the ancient Greeks set out the blueprints 
for depicting the body, based on their ideals of 
physical perfection. The figure remains a wonderful 
challenge. It presents technical difficulties – 
foreshortening, depicting life, individuality, and 
dimension – as well as the opportunity to explore  
the human condition, from the heroic to the humble. 
The classical nude
drawing from life
To fully meet the challenge of figure drawing, you 
should work from life, but much can still be 
learned by drawing from museum statues or even 
photographs. Classical poses typically exaggerate 
the curves and balance of the body; they may 
include a twist from the waist that creates a  
gentle dynamic within the form and therefore  
a more interesting pose. 
|
76
figure
poses and papers
Using a colored ground allows you to use the paper as the 
base color for the skin, and then to add light as well as dark  
tone to build and accentuate the forms. 
Standing poses make a strong – almost monumental – vertical statement, 
while reclining poses tend to create more interesting negative spaces 
between the limbs and torso. 

anatomy and form
An understanding of the body’s structure is essential  
if you are to give full expression to its spirit. Studying 
anatomy in books and sketching models informs you 
about the construction of the body, its proportions,  
and how the muscles, tendons, and skeleton direct  
and control the body. There is no need to memorize  
the position of every muscle and bone, but you should  
be familiar with key physical landmarks that will assist 
your work – the vocabulary of life drawing. 
The muscles of the 
scalp are so thin that 
the outline of the bone 
is visible beneath. 
Feet and hands possess 
an inherent  energy and 
expressiveness.  
Muscles soften the human 
form and provide the key 
contours of the body. 
Muscle and bone create the forms we see on the body; understanding 
their structure allows us to see where tension is created. 
 The external 
obliques are the 
only abdominal 
muscles to have 
much influence  
on surface form. 
The fleshy mass  
of the calf is 
produced by two 
separate muscles.  
Bone proportions 
vary depending  
on the age and  
sex of the subject. 
The angle of  
the pelvic  
bone is key to 
establishing  
the pose. 

 
Facial features, hair, hands, and feet are common 
stumbling blocks for artists because they are highly 
complex in form and surface, and need concentrated 
observation matched by technical aptitude. Mistakes 
in representing form and proportion glare out from 
the paper, because we are all so familiar with the 
human body. There is no easy formula for success: 
advance your skills through constant practice.  
The human form in focus
head and face detail 
The head is basically an oval shape, symmetrical  
around its vertical axis. This seems obvious, but is 
worth remembering when drawing three-quarters 
views of the face. A horizontal line drawn through 
the eyes defines the middle of the face – humans 
have very high foreheads. Though much of the 
forehead may be covered by hair, the forehead  
still extends forward above the eyebrows.  
eyes in line and tone
Fine, precise line perfectly describes the shape  
of the eye. Simplicity and accuracy are capable of 
conveying gaze just as well as detailed tonal work. 
Diffuse pastel work captures the form of the 
eye. In nature, the whites of the eyes are never 
pure white and reflections show a curved surface.

Drawing hair realistically can be painfully time-consuming. Here, ink cross- 
hatching captures the overall tonal qualities of hair, while a few fine lines 
describe individual strands, giving an impression of great detail throughout. 
Delicate pencil work, carefully observed, 
perfectly captures the gentle downward 
gesture of the model’s gaze. 
representing hair
Layered, broad brush strokes evoke  
the weight and curvature of the hair.
Bold, energetic charcoal lines define the 
structure of the hair and frame the face.

body detail
Hands and feet, fingers and toes pack a lot of 
structural complexity into a small area. For this 
reason you’ll see many drawings – even by old 
masters – where they have been deliberately 
omitted. There’s no need to be intimidated, but  
a basic knowledge of anatomy is vital in supporting 
your drawing skills. It helps to draw each part of  
a finger or toe as a short cylinder, with an oval 
overlapping the next to form the joint; from here, 
subtle variations of shape can be built up. 
79
| 79
The human form in focus|
Detail is key in bringing 
life to representational 
drawings of the human 
form. In this charcoal 
drawing, note the way  
the artist has paid attention 
to small undulations and 
irregularities in the surface, 
and has suggested muscle 
groups through subtle tone. 
Hands are expressive and may indicate aspects of character and narrative. 
Study and sketch the hand at rest and in tension to hone your skills. 
The foot is commonly  
foreshortened in a drawing 
and requires accurate 
observation. Bones, 
tendons, and veins are  
very evident, adding  
further complexity  
to the form. 

When you become confident in observing and drafting 
the human form, you can move into new creative 
territories, where the figure becomes a player within a 
visual narrative. Working on pose and gaze humanizes  
a model, inviting us to engage with their lives and their 
thoughts beyond the image. Posture and color can 
suggest movement, emotion, and intention, placing  
us firmly within the subject’s world.

The drama of the body
Narrative and the human form
To construct a drawing with a strong sense of 
narrative, you need to think like a writer. Make 
notes and sketches relating to characters from  
your own life, or allow yourself to be inspired  
by a passage in a novel or a scene from a play. 
Study theater and movie sets and the gestures and 
expressions of actors; use color and texture to 
create atmosphere and contextualize your ideas. 
Movement is present in this 
narrative drawing of a circus juggler. 
Using charcoal and an eraser in a 
gestural and energetic manner evokes 
the frantic energy of the subject. 
Degas drew intimate studies of dancers in relaxed  
poses, using vibrant strokes of vivid pastel color to contrast 
the wistful expressions of his young models  
with their theatrical environment. 

81
The drama of the body|
creating movement
Depicting motion became a major preoccupation 
for modernist artists – such as the Italian 
futurists – because it provided a means of 
breaking away from classical constraints. 
Dynamism can be injected into a drawing by 
transferring physical energy when making marks. 
Experiment with different media, making fast 
abstract lines across the surface. 
Vivid color injects motion and 
urgency into this study for a painting 
of a jogger moving through an urban 
landscape. The color appears to  
vibrate from the forms, which are 
established using loose brush  
strokes, spreading movement 
throughout the entire scene. 
Fine lines repeated, 
staggered, and 
periodically reinforced 
give this drawing a 
fantastic sense of 
dynamism.

F Young Woman Sleeping
Emerging from the ethereal traces of drawn brush

apparition. The proficiency of this drawing is evident 
through its economy of line that so beautifully 
conjures up the human form in repose. Rembrandt

Free, gestural drawing is tremendous fun because precision takes a back seat, 
allowing you to concentrate on sensitivity of touch. In this study, ink applied with 
a Japanese calligraphy brush is used to create a sensuous drawing of the human 
form. Making several repetitions of the drawing and using a self-critical eye to 
identify the strengths and weaknesses of each produces the best results. You’ll 
need to work on an easel: the brush should contact the paper head-on – almost 
impossible to achieve comfortably if you are seated.

posing the model
Ask your model to shift weight on to one leg, or to stretch out 
her arms and hands – anything that creates tension in the pose 
and defines harmonious areas of negative space. Make quick 
sketches of possible poses and select one to develop. 
Look at the model and mentally break down the form into  
a number of smooth lines, each of which can be made with 
one continuous movement. Load the brush with ink, and 
using a light but even weight of line, draw the head. Draw 
the slope of the shoulder and arm in relation to the head.  
Reject poses that do 
not possess enough 
dynamism.

Wipe the brush to 
reduce its ink load  
and add tone to the 
model’s back. Create an 
uneven texture by using 
the side of the brush 
here and in the hair.  
Fill the black tone of  
the chair and the deep 
shadows under the arm 
with heavier strokes. 
Closely examine the position of the 
bend of the knee in relation to the 
base of the chair and the feet before 
drawing these elements. Add 
shadow beneath the left knee to 
establish the position of the leg. 
Work on the form of the draped cloth, analyzing  
its folds and their positions relative to the back  
of the chair. Keep the brush loaded with ink so  
you can make smooth strokes. 
Pencil underdrawing is not needed when working  
with ink and brush; while it may improve accuracy,  
it compromises speed and spontaneity.

Heavier line brings 
the hip forward, 
creating dynamism 
in the drawing.  
Establish the side of the body, 
pressing harder on the brush to 
make the line wider. Increase  
the pressure on the brush as you 
descend to boost the strength  
of line in the hip area. 
Reload the brush with ink, then 
draw the outline of the draped cloth 
on the chair in order to “seat” the  
model. Avoid making fussy marks – 
purity and clarity of line are key  
to the success of the drawing.

Use the tip of the brush to indicate the 
presence of the chair legs; there’s no need  
to draw them in detail – indeed this would 
detract from the strong graphic form made  
by the model’s body.  
Draw the line of the spine very lightly – 
make a smooth curve, pressing harder onto 
the paper only at intervals to create a flowing 
organic shape. Add some light tone to the 
lower leg to produce a sense of form.

Make several attempts at this 
drawing, pausing to critique what you 
have done before moving on. Working 
with a brush takes time to master; part 
of the challenge lies with the lack of 
tactile feedback from the paper. 

 Seven for one
Quick, gestural drawing was used to make 
seven drawings, each of which took about  
10 minutes: the best selected drawing, 
shown right, is expressive and surprisingly 
accurate, despite being made up of  
very few lines. Drawing with a brush 
emphasizes the beauty of line, and even 
small variations in pressure create organic 
variations in its thickness and density.

This playfully expressive study of a standing figure is more decorative than 
analytical because it employs colored pencil on a colored background, rather than 
stark black on white. The focus of the drawing is the surface of the boldly-
patterned dress and the pose of the model: color is used nonrepresentationally to 
emphasize the subject. Colored pencil allows very fine, delicate work –  
a degree of precision in mark making that creates a drawing that could not  
have been achieved using heavier pastels.

pencils

•	Directional shading

Determine the weight of the pose, which runs through the 
head to the back foot, and provides the central axis for the 
drawing. Continue sketching to establish the basic shape  
of the model: make multiple fine lines, keeping your marks 
free and loose, until you “find” the form.
Pose the model to create a dynamic curve in the dress.  
Map out the outline of the body using the pale Venetian red 
pencil. Use the head as a basic unit of measurement, and 
ensure the body is in proportion (see p. 22). Trust your eyes 
in assessing the proportions of foreshortened limbs.  
The right arm is 
considerably 
foreshortened.
Capturing the 
model’s weight 
distribution is key.

Loosely sketch the outlines of the pattern on the dress,  
and then begin putting down the base color with the  
white pencil. Color roughly at first, making marks on  
the diagonal to give the drawing energy.  
Outline the areas of rose pink color 
with the fuschia pencil: this addition 
of contrast helps to contain the 
floral areas and immediately lifts  
the drawing. Sharpen your pencils 
frequently to keep the lines crisp.
Add the details of the flower stems 
on the dress using the evergreen 
pencil. Reinforce the background 
white tone in the dress, making 
bolder directional marks with  
the white pencil.
Create areas of highlight using 
strokes of the white pencil at right 
angles to the previous white marks. 
Note how this produces a luminous 
sheen on the dress against the 
colored background.  
Begin coloring the floral areas of the dress with the rose 
pink pencil, again working on the same cross angle to 
give the drawing consistency. Work quickly – the pose  
is a hard one for the model to sustain for long periods.

Introduce modeling to the skin with the sap green pencil 
(green and olive tones are present in skin); the blue of the 
paper carries the cooler skin tones. Work lightly – heavy 
tonal values in the skin will ruin the delicacy of the 
drawing and pull the eye away from the dress.

“Colored pencil is a highly 
controllable, precise, and 
forgiving medium.”
Use the sap green pencil to add shadow and form to  
the calves. Soften the marks on the leg by rubbing  
them back gently with a plastic eraser.
Add detail to the feet and shoes with the Venetian  
red pencil; work a little more heavily in this area to 
ground the model.   
Use the evergreen pencil to strengthen the line 
of the left side of the dress. This pulls that  
side of the body forward, emphasizing the  
twist in the model’s pose. Draw the lines of  
the petals in the dress with the fuschia pencil.

 Girl in a party dress
This is a personal, evocative study of the human form 
that implies familiarity with the subject – perhaps a 
friend or a partner. The informality of the approach  
is complemented by the deliberately relaxed pose and 
by the choice of colored pencil, which provides an  
intimate way of working – building up colors, forms, 
and tones stroke by stroke. 
Draw the face and hair using the hazel 
pencil. Hold the pencil away from its tip; 
this allows the lines of the hair to become 
“kinked.” The heavier weight of line in the  
hair balances the composition, allowing  
the face to remain lighter, more enigmatic.
Always talk to your model to make sure she is   
comfortable, warm, and happy to hold a pose. 
Experienced life models will be able to suggest or 
modify poses that make for dynamic compositions.  
Look more at the model, with frequent glances, than 
at the paper – think of the process as tracing rather 
than analyzing the outline.

The long tradition of self-portraiture among artists shows that the mirror gives us  
a very compelling viewpoint for a drawing. Part of the appeal of drawing yourself  
is practical – you always have a model available – but part lies in the challenge  
of marrying subjective and objective observation. Technically, you need to analyze 
what you see in the mirror and resolve it into line and tone, but emotionally, you 
are setting out to explore your self-image. Charcoal is an ideal medium for 
capturing the energy, personality, and rich detail of a self-portrait.

Settle on a comfortable pose. Orientate your body in a 
reproducible way – for example with one knee touching the 
side of the easel – to create reference points that help you 
return to your original position when you move. Continue 
mapping the outline of the head and shoulders.  
Set up your easel and position the mirror – you will need to 
consider how to frame the portrait, how to crop your features, 
and whether you will be looking into the mirror or away. 
Begin by locating the extremities of the composition by 
marking out the top of the head and the neckline. 
Charcoal sticks 
can make very 
precise lines. 
The neckline 
provides a scaffold 
for the composition.

Assess the relationships between the features 
– the distances between the eyes, between the 
eye and the base of the nose, and the width of 
the nose. Make sure these dimensions are in 
proportion to one another; mark them in with 
light, erasable strokes of the charcoal. 
Continue establishing the positions of the features with respect to one 
another, and to the chin and crown of the head. Remember that the 
features take up a surprisingly small part of the head: the midpoint  
of the face, measured from chin to crown, is at the base of the eyes. 
Large-scale self-portraits in charcoal require 
room to maneuver. Tape the paper to an easel to 
permit free movement of your arm; you can 
attach the mirror to the easel with a binder clip.

Examine your reflection; draw the face 
you see, not your mental image of that 
face. Identify the key characteristics – 
arched eyebrows and a strong nose – 
and ensure you render them faithfully, 
not as a caricature. 
Make regular use of the eraser, 
reassessing and refining proportions as 
you go. The eraser is just as essential a 
tool as the charcoal; if you’re not using  
it, you’re not being sufficiently critical.  
Add tone to the shirt, hair, and chest 
areas using quick, loose strokes of  
the charcoal. Blend these marks 
directionally with your fingertip  
to indicate the nap of the fabric  
and create a sense of solidity.

“Charcoal is fast, direct, 
and responsive, making  
it the least inhibiting  
of media.”
Use heavier line to accentuate telling aspects of  
your appearance – such as the folds and bow of the 
headscarf. Add character to the drawing by bringing 
these details into focus. 
Refine the lines of the features using 
the fine tip of the charcoal stick. 
Establish the gaze of the eye – it is  
a key expression of personality. The 
gaze in a self-portrait will tend to be 
one of inquiry because you are 
inevitably analyzing the subject. 
Darken the eyes to bring expression into the face. Shade 
and blend the background to the left, bringing the head  
into relief: fade the tone gently to the right, leaving a  
blue “window” of untouched paper to the extreme right.

Build up heavier lines in the hair 
and fabric to inject dynamism 
into the work. Be brave – you 
sometimes need to disrupt the 
order you have created to 
reassamble more interesting forms. 
Rub back the bolder lines. Don’t 
be afraid of leaving the footprints  
of your working, such as 
rubbings out and finger marks – 
they add an intriguing extra 
dimension to the drawing. 
Use your finger selectively as  
a drawing tool to drag charcoal 
into forms. Draw the diffuse  
line of the bow in this way to  
lift it above the firmer lines  
of the hair that lies beneath. 
Add final strengthening lines 
and more tone to the headscarf. 
Use the plastic eraser to take 
away tone from the shirt, leaving 
behind bright highlights. Erase 
the strong line to the left of the 
arm, the boundary of which is 
then held purely by the tone  
of the background. 
 Self-portrait 
Bold charcoal strokes and strong contrasts 
of light and dark are key to the impact of 
this work, capturing the visual drama of 
the face. The neckline and headscarf  
act as a frame within the frame of the 
drawing, pulling attention toward  
the face.

Add further shading to the left 
of the head to pull its form 
forward. Rub back with a 
fingertip so that this tone has a 
lower value than the hair to the 
right; if the tones are even, the 
drawing will tend to flatten out. 
Note how the larger areas of 
tone pick up the honeycomb 
pattern of the paper, adding  
an extra textural element  
to the work. 



Concepts
“Drawing offers a huge 
range of possibilities 
for mirroring today’s 
preoccupations.”

Traditionally, drawing subjects were more or less 
restricted to the natural world, still life, and the human 
figure. This has changed; drawing today has few limits 
in terms of its subjects, materials, and techniques. 
However, this unprecedented freedom can create its 
own tyranny. More than ever, it is essential to develop 
your own personal framework to work within and be 
clear about targeting your intentions and interests.

reinventing media and subject  
The range of drawing media is constantly 
expanding, and today, traditional techniques sit 
alongside new materials and digital processes, 
providing entirely new channels for expression. 
A traditional still-life subject is 
here tackled using mixed media – 
ink and pastel – drawn on a Plexiglas 
ground. With light seeping from 
behind, the chaotic drawing, with  
its distorted perspective, takes  
on a quirky cartoon-like quality.  
A broad dark ink wash is the perfect base for the spirograph 
snowflake-like forms in white ink, which float on the surface of this 
mysterious and evocative drawing – is it landscape or abstract pattern? 
New and mixed media allow revolutionary takes  
on old subjects, and are suited to more radical 
experimentation – exploring the nature of 
representation and of mind itself. 
This representation of  
a figure eschews classical 
tradition in favor of 
emotional intensity. The 
closed pose, combined with 
dense, simplified areas of 
pattern and color, and lack 
of tone creates an iconic 
image of introspection.

other collage elements and placed in a surreal golden 
window that gives a view on to a stylized mountain. Formal 
perspective devices are used to create the illusion of an 
imaginary world.  
toward animation
Experimenting with the ground of a drawing opens up new 
possibilities; inspired by traditional animation, these logo-like 
line images were drawn on to clear acetate. 
Made separately, the drawings can be overlaid to form an entirely new graphic 
image. Moreover, this drawing has an existence in time – moving the elements 
relative to one another creates a new visual experience each time. 
This drawing of a building, based on the conventions of 
architectural representation, is given a new edge by careful 
choice of media. The use of black and gold suggests power 
and gravitas, transforming the skeletal structure into a 
modernist temple.  

 
Drawing practice is an ongoing process, and as with all 
creative acts, the more you do the better you will get.  
All your efforts – even those that seem unsuccessful – 
contribute to your development. If you do not achieve 
your desired results, the answer may not be to move on 
to new subject matter, but to try different approaches, 
media, and compositions. Repetition and formal 
exercises can also be useful in unlocking your creativity.

Drawing as a continuous process
reworking the past 
Drawings are left unfinished or unresolved for a 
variety of reasons. A good learning exercise is to 
revisit old work with a fresh critical eye, appraise 
its strengths and weaknesses, and inject it with 
new life by adding collage elements, new colors, or 
textures. Drawings with a strong structural 
foundation and interesting composition make  
ideal subjects for reworking. 
revisiting a drawing
This pastel and ink drawing was mapped out but never completed; 
the colors are weak and do not enhance the composition. 
Reinforcing the tonal areas and brightening the color with 
pastels and colored pencil completes the drawing. 
cutting and recomposing
Existing images can be combined and collaged  
to create interesting new visual descriptions that 
are far more than the sum of their parts. This 
approach works well with contrasting pairs of 
drawings; the opposition of lively and colorful, and 
static and linear, for example.  
Two old drawings of very 
different styles – one 
abstract in energetic ink and 
shellac, and one figurative  
charcoal – are chosen to 
create the new work.   
The images are torn, cut, and juxtaposed to create a 
third dynamic, which was not present in either original.  
A new medium 
– pastel – is 
used to unite

Becoming technically adept at drawing gives  
you the ability to fulfil your creative intentions. 
Different people arrive at this point through 
different means; for some, it is illuminating to 
comprehend the pathways from brain to hand  
that underlie all creative mark-making. Exploring 
these connections through some simple exercises 
is interesting, although maybe a little unsettling. 
If you are right-handed, draw with your left hand. You will 
concentrate much harder on the subject and become 
aware of your conscious intentions to move your hand.

The same vase, drawn in stark white against

A doorway and distinct horizon create depth 
in this version of the jug, which also plays 
with color theory.

Drawing is illusion, and your choice of subject need not be constrained by what is 
really “out there.” The subject of this drawing is a group of real terracotta objects – 
archaeological finds – combined with a photograph of a classical Greek scene. 
The two subjects are unified by harmonious composition and by the deliberate  
use of a restricted color palette. The warm brown and terracotta pastel pencils  
are sympathetic to both subjects, conjouring up both a sense of antiquity and 
earthy texture, and of the burnt Greek summer landscape.

using the light burnt ocher

Start adding detail to the broken pot using the deep 
terracotta pastel pencil to give depth to the floral relief. 
Analyze the forms and make sure you draw the floral relief 
you see rather than your idea of a flower. Establish the lip  
of the pot with the same pastel: note how the darker tone 
brings the front of the object forward in the drawing. 
Strengthen the lines of the pottery objects to set their 
positions. Rest your hand on a scrap sheet of paper  
to prevent smudging the marks below. Examine the  
asymmetries in the objects and make no assumptions  
about their shapes; draw what you see. Aim to identify  
and capture the objects’ personalities. 
“Objects come to life 
through their 
irregularities.”
Sketch in the forms of 
the other pottery objects, 
measuring their size with 
your pencil if needed 
(see p. 22). Review the 
spaces between the 
elements, as well as 
their sizes and 
proportions, adjusting 
until you are happy  
with the composition.  
Warm, deep

Begin shading the foreground objects 
to establish form and shadow; knock 
in the tone loosely with the dark 
terracotta pastel. Use the pastel 
selectively, with less tone in the 
highlight areas to emphasize the 
curved forms of the objects. 
Smudge the surface with your 
fingertip to blend and refine the 
tone. Adjust the pressure as you 
smudge – more pressure in areas 
of heavier pastel coverage 
produces a darker tone with  
a more apparent solidity. 
Reassess the shape of the objects 
as the drawing progresses: the 
beauty of chalk pastel is its ability 
to be repeatedly rubbed back and 
adjusted. Reinforce only the 
foreground lines you are happy 
with, using the sienna pencil,  
and blend away other lines  
using your fingertip.
Return to the background and 
reinforce your faint initial lines  
with the sienna pastel pencil. 
Establish the framework of the 
buildings and the crumbling wall, 
adding the suggestion of individual 
bricks in selected areas. 
Draw a strong line with the ruler 
and the deep terracotta pastel 
pencil to indicate the edges of the 
table on which the objects rest. 
This provides a grounding for the 
still life. Ensure that the plane of 
the table matches the perspective 
of the background to unite the 
elements visually.

Build up the shadows 
using the sienna pastel 
stick; it is not a good  
idea to use gray and black 
for shadow areas when 
working in pastel because 
the results tend to appear 
muddy. Ensure that all 
extraneous lights are 
switched off when  
working on the shadows.  
Build up the modeling on 
the shadowed side of the 
vase with the ocher pastel 
stick. Rub away at the 
applied pigment with the 
plastic eraser following  
the curved form of the 
pot; this creates interest  
as the pastel keys into  
the texture of the paper.  
Add dense ocher to the 
side of the broken pot. 
Reassess the image, 
looking in particular at  
the negative spaces that 
are now emerging between 
the strong blocks of tone – 
these areas contribute to 
the integrity of the 
composition.

Build the edges of the objects with the deep terracotta 
pastel pencil; there’s no need to work too finely, because 
the rawness of the drawing is part of its appeal. Create 
an edge to details by rubbing back the tone with a small 
eraser, rather than by introducing hard boundary lines. 
Work heavily with the burnt umber pastel pencil, 
uniting the base of each object with the dense 
shadow that it casts. This serves to anchor the 
objects to the table surface and contributes to  
the three-dimensional illusion. 
Add tone to the ruin in the 
background with the burnt 
umber pastel pencil. Hold the 
pencil loosely – the unsure line 
that results helps to make the 
background more recessive and 
reinforces a realistic sense of 
depth. Use the plastic eraser  
to smudge and soften the 
background tones – the focus  
of this drawing needs to remain 
firmly on the foreground objects.

Add detail to the background 
and extend its tone to almost 
meet the still life objects; this 
helps to unite the elements in 
the drawing. Add burnt umber 
detail into the floral relief for a

Drawing over a projected image has a long tradition, stretching from the 
Renaissance to Andy Warhol – indeed, today’s digital and slide projectors are 
derived from the camera obscura, the idea of which was first set out by Aristotle. 
Far from limiting your options, working over a projection opens up new 
opportunities – to work on a huge scale, to represent movement, or to explore 
cultural and personal icons. This drawing of geishas in a traditional Japanese 
setting uses bold pastel to capture a scene full of drama.

choosing the image
Selecting a suitable image for projection is key to success: 
choose a photo which contains formal elements that translate 
well into a drawing – perspective, a sense of place and 
atmosphere, and human narrative are all desirable. 
Position your projector on a vibration-free surface. Switch on 
the lamp and scale the enlargement to fit your paper. Lightly 
draw over the key outlines of the figures and the folds in the 
fabric using the light gray pastel pencil. 
Neutral gray line will 
not detract from  
the vibrant color  
of the drawing.
“Drawing is more than 
an academic exercise – 
it’s about fulfilling your 
intentions.”

Establish the background, working 
with the light gray pastel pencil 
over the top of the projection. You 
can be far freer with your marks, 
and add more detail to the drawing 
than would be usual at this early 
stage because you can be confident 
that the proportions of the drawing 
are all correct. 
Bring hints of tone into densely shadowed areas of the 
drawing; the gray acts as an underlay for the colored  
pastel which will be added later. 
Examine the outlines with the projector switched off to 
ensure they are all complete. Switch the projector on again, 
and begin laying down the color and texture of the slatted 
wood and wall with the lemon yellow and soft orange pastel 
sticks to set up the solidity of the architectural elements. 
Using a projector allows you to scale an image with exact 
precision. This is very useful if you have chosen to work on  
a large sheet of paper, or even a fresco, when establishing 
correct proportions can be difficult.

Smudge the soft orange of the walls to 
smooth out and prepare the surface, which 
will be later overdrawn with darker pastel 
tones. Smudge selectively, leaving some 
areas of the orange crayon raw and bold; 
this helps provide textural interest. 
Gestural marks convey 
clusters of leaves, rather 
than individual leaf detail. 
Use the chrome green light 
pastel stick to represent the 
trees in the background. Think 
of the color in the projection  
as a guide only – feel free to  
exaggerate for graphic effect.  
Add density to the shadows 
behind the trees with the mid-
gray and gray-green pastel 
crayons. Keep the tone rough – 
drawing too finely shifts emphasis 
away from the foreground figure.  
Mark the spokes of the parasol using the 
dark purple pastel pencil. Keep the marks 
firm, precise, and regular to reflect the 
structure of the parasol. 
Add color to the broad concentric rings of the parasol using 
the ultramarine deep pastel. Smudge to create a uniform 
quality to these blue rings, which help to balance the 
warmer color range in the rest of the drawing.

Color the hub of the parasol. Use coral red 
pastel pencil, which links with the red of the 
kimono and the lips of the geisha, and is the 
motif color for the drawing. 
Use the mid-gray and ocher pastel sticks to  
add texture to the wooden sides of the building. 
Work over the soft orange undercoat, picking  
out patterns and knots within the wood.
Begin coloring the kimono of the lead geisha with a deep 
yellow pastel stick for the main areas and orange for the bustle; 
use the coral red for the pattern. These fiery colors contrast 
strongly with the muted background palette.

Draw the lips in coral red, and the face and hair 
in burnt umber pastel pencil, leaving a few 
highlights in the hair. The face is one of few 
white areas in the drawing, and so draws the eye. 
Work on the rear geisha; use the carmine pink for her 
kimono and the deep yellow for the cummerbund. Draw 
the face and hair with the B charcoal pencil; work 
loosely so as not to pull attention from the leading figure.

Concepts
Color the sky with the sky blue pastel 
stick. Work the pigment with your fingertip 
to create an area of smooth, flat color that 
recedes into the background. 
Add tone to the path with the cool-colored Mars violet 
pastel stick. Leave this unblended to provide a rough 
contrast to the geisha. Reinforce the shadows cast by  
the figures and the building with the B charcoal pencil.

H Projected image
Bold compositional elements and dramatic human forms give 
this scene a real sense of theater. With the projection removing 
the need to measure and examine the subject, the drawing 
becomes more concerned with the quality of mark making.  
Lightly rub back the dark purple lines with a plastic 
eraser to make them less harsh. Add futher texture  
to the background using the olive pastel stick. 
Add more deep yellow tone to the kimono, blending the 
tone with your finger. Outline the hands and margins  
of the robe with the dark purple pastel pencil – this 
contributes to the graphic character of the drawing.

Using geometric forms in drawing hints at a utopian vision – a world of order and 
regular beauty. Nature too displays mathematical geometry in its forms – albeit  
in a more complex manner – and the combination of pure geometry with abstract 
natural form makes an intriguing subject in this drawing. Executed in colored 
pencil in a sensitive palette, the drawing begins with the tracing of a floral motif 
onto isometric graph paper, used by architects and engineers, and then explores 
the interaction of abstracted forms and colors.

choosing patterns and colors
The subject of this drawing is repeated geometric form; spend 
some time experimenting with variants of pattern and color 
until you have achieved your desired effect. 
Lay your chosen sheet of wrapping paper (or any other source 
of a natural pattern) over a sheet of carbon paper. Place these 
over a sheet of isometric graph paper and tape together. Trace 
the floral pattern with a ballpoint pen, which creates a strong 
but fine line. 
Sheets taped 
together 
prevent 
movement.

Geometric construction
12
Decide on the size and shape of your underlying 
geometric form; the pattern is made up of repeated 
hexagons, measuring six triangles of the isometric 
graph paper on each side. Mark the skeletal positions 
of the hexagons using zinc yellow colored pencil.   
Choose a repeating pattern of color to fill the 
hexagons – diagonal rows with alternating light 
blue and water green; deep chrome and turquoise 
green; and zinc yellow and soft plum. Color the 
hexagons, rigidly following this pattern. 
Guided by the isometric paper, vary the pressure and the 
direction of the shading to build up a faint cubic form 
within each hexagon. The resulting cubic patten has strong 
dimensional qualities that throw the overlying floral pattern 
forward, as if on another plane. 
Check your tracing early on to ensure that the carbon 
marks are sufficiently intense and that there is no 
movement in the paper. Keep the marks clear at this stage, 
though they will bleed later when color is applied.
“Repetition of a graphic 
motif has a curious 
romanticism of its own.”
Carbon pigment 
remains loose  
and workable.

Work around the outlines of the 
flowers, but don’t be too concerned  
if you cross the edges; the overlying 
colors of the flowers will create a glow 
around the boundary lines.  
Bring out the cubic forms that you have already established within the hexagons. 
Add denser shading to the left-hand faces of the cubes, while keeping their tops 
and right-hand faces lighter to give the impression of directional lighting; avoid 
making the edges of the cubes too strong, otherwise the lines could conflict  
with the floral pattern. 
Color the foreground flowers and 
stems working from the top of the 
drawing down. Use the same colors 
as those in the background, but for 
each foreground flower use the color 
of the background hexagon 
immediately to its left. Following 
this preset system, a clear pattern  
of color emerges. 
 Geometric construction
A limited palette of cool candy colors gives 
this drawing a contemporary pitch and 
demonstrates the possibilities of working 
from second- or third-hand representations 
of nature.

concepts
In conceptual drawings, colors can  
be far removed from those found in the 
natural world. Choose your palette to 
convey mood or to explore pattern 
rather than to represent reality. 
color choice


Glossary 
Abstract
A drawing or other work  
of art that is intentionally  
non-representational. 
Acetate
A transparent or translucent 
plastic, available in various 
colors, that can be used as a 
basis for drawings and overlays.
Advancing color
A warm color, such as yellow, 
red, or orange, that appears to 
bring a drawn surface toward 
the viewer’s eye.
Allusive
A type of image that makes 
indirect references to other 
objects or circumstances, 
inviting and challenging  
the viewer to explore the 
connections between the two.  
Art paper
Drawing paper made from 
cotton pulp, rather than  
wood pulp, for better surface 
textures and enhanced archival 
qualities. It is usually thicker 
than office or sketching paper 
to prevent buckling when wet, 
and may be coated with a fine 
clay compound that creates  
a smooth surface on one or 
both sides. 
Axonometric
A method of drawing a plan 
view, especially of a building, 
where all the lengths are 
drawn in exact proportion to 
their true dimensions, and 
circular forms are drawn as 
circles rather than ellipses.  
It is used in technical 
drawings by designers, 
engineers, and architects.
Blending
Mixing colors or tones on  
the paper surface so that they 
blur from one to another. The 
blending tool can be a finger,  
a shaper, a tissue, or a rag. 
Charcoal and pastel are  
good media for blending. 
Calligraphy
The art of decorative writing, 
but also used to describe a 
form of fluid drawing, usually 
with ink and brush. 
Collage
The art of creating a visual 
assemblage of different forms 
to make a new whole. 
Conté crayon
A drawing medium made of 
compressed pigment – usually 
an earth tone – mixed with a 
wax or clay base. Square in 
cross-section and relatively 
hard, it allows for more precise 
marks than softer pastels. 
Contrast
The degree of tonal separation 
or gradation in a drawing. 
Crosshatching
Crisscrossing parallel lines  
to create tone. The closer  
the lines, the denser the tone.  
A good technique in linear 
media, such as pencil and pen.
 
Dip pen
An ink pen composed of a 
metal nib with capillary 
channels, mounted on a 
handle or holder, often  
made of wood. In contrast  
to a fountain pen, the dip pen 
has no internal ink reservoir.

GLOSSARY

Dry painting
A term sometimes used to 
describe drawing with pastels. 
Expressionism
Art characterized by its focus 
on subjective feelings, and its 
use of symbolic colors and 
exaggerated imagery. 
Fixative
Liquid resin spray or atomizer 
used to glue and consolidate 
the loose surface produced 
when working with media 
such as pastel or charcoal. 
Foreshortening
The effect of perspective  
that makes forms appear  
to get smaller with distance, 
particularly noticeable in 
figure drawing, when it distorts 
the proportions of the body. 
Framing
The act of applying a physical 
frame to a drawing to protect 
and enhance its presentation. 
Also, the introduction of 
elements into a drawing that 
set out areas of space within 
the composition. 
Futurism
An artistic movement of the 
early 20th century. Futurism 
glorified the technological 
progress, energy, and violence 
of modern society. Typical of 
the movement were dynamic 
compositions of superimposed 
and interlocking forms.  
Gaze 
The depiction of the eyes of a 
subject, not just as pure form, 
but as an expression of the 
personality and mood. 
Gesso
A mixture of calcium 
carbonate, pigment, and  
an animal-derived glue – or 
now more commonly acrylic 
polymer medium – used to 
prime a drawing surface. 
Gesso produces a finely 
textured ground. 
Gestural drawing
A style of drawing that 
explores the form and 
movement of an object in 
space. It may look realistic, 
but more often gestural 
drawings convey just a  
sense of overall form. 
Graphite
The carbon–clay mix used  
in pencils. Graphite sticks  
are pure graphite without  
the wooden casing. 
Ground
The drawing surface,  
most often paper. 
Haystacking
Repeated layered cross- 
hatching at various angles, 
used to build up dense  
shadow areas in a drawing. 
Highlight
The brightest area of 
illumination on a form, which 
appears on that part of the 
surface most perpendicular  
to the light source. 
Impressionism
A 19th-century art movement 
with works characterized by a 
focus on light and space, and 
the use of unmixed primary 
colors and small strokes to 
simulate actual reflected light. 
123
Glossary|

Incident light
The light falling upon an 
object, rather than that 
reflected from its surface. 
India ink
Used for both writing and 
drawing, a type of ink that 
usually includes pigment 
mixed with a solvent and 
binder (traditionally shellac), 
which dries to a water-
resistant permanent line.
Life drawing
Drawing a human figure from 
observations of a live model. 
Line 
The fundamental element of  
a drawing: a line has length, 
width, tone, and texture. It 
may divide space, define a 
form or contour, or suggest  
a direction of motion. 
Linear perspective
A method of portraying three 
dimensions on a flat surface  
by showing how parallel lines, 
for example of a road, appear 
to converge in the distance. 
Medium
The drawing material, such  
as charcoal, pen, pencil, or 
pastel (media in the plural). 
Mixed media
The use of more than one 
medium to create a drawing, 
for example, the combination 
of graphite and pastel. 
Negative space
The gaps between objects,  
and between objects and the 
frame of the drawing. Negative 
space is as important as 
positive form in creating a 
harmonious composition. 
One-point perpective 
In linear perspective, parallel 
lines are at right angles to the 
picture plane and meet at a 
vanishing point on the horizon. 
Pastel 
A color drawing medium in 
which powdered pigments are 
bound with gum or another 
binding agent into sticks.  
Soft pastels, also called chalk 
pastels, are powdery. Conté 
crayons are harder. Both come 
in pencil form. Oil pastels are 
sticky, and closer to painting 
media. A drawing made with 
pastels is called a pastel. 
Perspective
A drawing made in perspective 
looks like a vision of the real 
three-dimensional world 
through the use of modeling, 
linear perspective, and color. 
Positive shape
The outline created by  
an object in a drawing. 
Prepared paper
A sheet of paper that has  
been prepared by coating  
with gesso, another pigment, 
or a textured ground. 
Projection
The use of a projector, which 
may be a slide, overhead, or 
digital projector, to enlarge an 
image on to a wall or easel. The 
projected image is then used 
as the basis for the drawing, 
providing tonal, color, and 
perspectival guidelines. 
Proportion
The accurate relationship  
of part to part in a realistic 
drawing. Also relates to a 
sense of balance.

GLOSSARY

Recessive color
A cool color, such as blue  
or green, that appears to pull  
a drawn surface away from  
the viewer’s eye.
Release
The use of a solvent, often  
but not always water, to free 
pigment from drawn marks. 
Release of the pigment creates 
the effect of a wash around 
the harder drawn lines. 
Representational 
A drawing that sets out to 
achieve a near-likeness of the 
objects being drawn. Drawings 
that strive to achieve the 
qualities of realism.
Shadow
The darkness cast when  
light is obscured, either  
on an object, or by it. 
Silhouette 
A drawing made up of an 
outline of an object or figure, 
especially the human profile, 
filled in with solid color. 
Stencil
A template made by cutting 
out a design from stiff 
cardboard. Pigment is applied 
through or around the cut 
areas of a template so that the 
pattern will be reproduced on 
the ground below.
Still life
A representation of inanimate 
objects, whether natural or 
synthetic. 
Texture
The actual or suggested 
surface quality of a drawing. 
Texture can be created by 
using skillful drawing 
techniques, erasing, rubbing, 
or employing specific materials.
Tone
From white to black, how  
light or dark something is, 
regardless of its color.  
Some colors are inherently 
light or dark in tone: yellow, 
for example, is always light. 
Tooth
The raised grain of textured 
paper, which bites into the 
medium applied to it. Powdery 
media, such as charcoal or soft 
pastel, need paper with a tooth 
to stick to the surface. 
Two-point perspective
In linear perspective, an object 
such as a building has vertical 
edges parallel to the picture 
plane, but its sides are seen  
as angles. The horizontal lines 
of the sides appear to converge 
at two separate vanishing 
points on the horizon. 
Underdrawing
A preliminary drawing, often 
in faint charcoal or pencil,  
in which the outlines of the 
composition are sketched  
in preparation for detailed  
work over the top. This  
work may be carried out  
using different media. 
Vanishing point
In linear perspective, the point 
where receding parallel lines 
appear to converge. 
Vignette
A drawing in which the tones 
fade gradually away until they 
blend with the surface. Also 
used to describe a small 
decorative drawing.
