ABSTRACT
Chance, luck, and good fortune are the usual go-to descriptors of serendipity, a phenomenon aptly 
often coupled with famous anecdotes of accidental discoveries in engineering and science in mod-
ern history such as penicillin, Teflon, and Post-it notes. Serendipity, however, is evident in many 
fields of research, in organizations, in everyday life—and there is more to it than luck implies. While 
the phenomenon is strongly associated with in-person interactions with people, places, and things, 
most attention of late has focused on its preservation and facilitation within digital information 
environments. Serendipity’s association with unexpected, positive user experiences and outcomes 
has spurred an interest in understanding both how current digital information environments sup-
port serendipity and how novel approaches may be developed to facilitate it. Research has sought to 
understand serendipity, how it is manifested in people’s personality traits and behaviors, how it may 
be facilitated in digital information environments such as mobile applications, and its impacts on 
an individual, an organizational, and a wider level. Because serendipity is expressed and understood 
in different ways in different contexts, multiple methods have been used to study the phenomenon 
and evaluate digital information environments that may support it. This volume brings together 
different disciplinary perspectives and examines the motivations for studying serendipity, the vari-
ous ways in which serendipity has been approached in the research, methodological approaches to 
build theory, and how it may be facilitated. Finally, a roadmap for serendipity research is drawn by 
integrating key points from this volume to produce a framework for the examination of serendipity 
in digital information environments.

Preface
Serendipity…the word conjures up an image of that fortuitous finding, one that evokes a happy 
human response. From its unassuming roots in literary scholarship in the Georgian era, the con-
cept emerged in the 20th century to represent fortuitous discoveries perceived to be by chance, but 
clearly informed by significant knowledge and experience. Often equated with scientific discoveries 
it has evolved to be now associated with that unexpected but informed outcome in the social sci-
ences and humanities and indeed in everyday life. 
When we think of serendipity in digital information environments, we are constrained by 
physicality of that setting—the digital device, and also by the range of activities that may occur 
within that space and contexts. This book starts with an understanding of its initial origins and 
application and transfers that understanding to its application to and evolution in digital spaces. 
It examines the motivation for a renewed and intense interest in serendipity in research and de-
velopment (R&D), and identifies the various interpretations of serendipity (e.g., event, outcome, 
process) that have been made to inform a better understanding of where and how to approach the 
concept in R&D. It examines how we can and do facilitate serendipity in digital spaces, and how, 
methodologically, to research the concept in these spaces.
To start such a work, we put our assumptions and perspectives about serendipity aside, 
and began with a “clean slate.” We conducted a systematic review of the research on serendipity, 
first searching broadly in four databases (Web of Science, ProQuest, EBSCO, and ACM Digital 
Library) for papers that serve as the basis for Chapters 2–5. In May 2016, we downloaded 1,293 
citations but after removing duplicates and doing an initial cull based on title and abstract to en-
sure topic fit, we selected 550 for a closer look. From these, as well as papers subsequently gathered 
through other methods (e.g., citation chaining), we selected approximately 100 papers that met the 
following conditions for a more thorough examination.
•	 Paper was a published, peer-reviewed study of serendipity in digital environments; 
literature reviews, conceptual papers, and theses were not considered in the systematic 
review.
•	 Papers that mentioned serendipity only superficially were not considered.
•	 No restrictions on how authors defined serendipity.
•	 Research was empirical, using either or both qualitative or quantitative methods, but 
with no restrictions on method or methodology.

PREFACE
•	 No restrictions on research area or topic with respect to: 
ºº information use environment (e.g., work leisure, learning, commerce);
ºº domain, field, or area (e.g., science, history, education);
ºº platform, application, or service (e.g., Twitter, WorldCat); 
ºº type of digital device (e.g., mobile, laptop, wearable); and
ºº content or its format (e.g., text, image, sound).
Seminal works that do not meet the above criteria (e.g., Merton and Barber, 2004) are 
also referenced throughout the volume, but by conducting the systematic review, we hope that 
we have provided a useful “state-of-the-art” synthesis of the research on serendipity in digital 
information environments.

Acknowledgments
We are grateful to many colleagues, whose insights and exchanges have contributed over the years 
to our thinking about serendipity, including Lennart Björneborn, Samantha Copeland, Sanda 
Erdelez, Jannica Heinström, Stephann Makri, Kim Martin, Anabel Quan-Haase, and Borchuluun 
Yadamsuren. A SSHRC Aid to Workshops and Conferences Program grant enabled SCORE: 
Serendipity, Chance and Opportunity in Information Discovery, a workshop hosted in Montreal in 
2012, to bring together a group of researchers to unpeel the concept of serendipity in digital in-
formation environments.
We also acknowledge financial support for the research that informed much of the thinking 
behind this volume. Toms’ initial research on browsing in digital user environments (which ser-
endipitously introduced her research to serendipity) was funded by a NSERC (Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council of Canada) grant to her Ph.D. supervisor, Professor Jean 
Tague-Sutcliffe, University of Western Ontario (now Western University). Their individual and 
joint research, including McCay-Peet’s Ph.D. work, was partially funded by a SSHRC (Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) Research Grant, on Serendipity in Knowl-
edge Work to Toms; and a SSHRC Doctoral Scholarship to McCay-Peet. Finally, we acknowledge 
the support of the Canada Foundation for Innovation that funded the research infrastructure that 
enabled multiple research projects, and Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada who 
hosted the research projects.

CHAPTER  1
Introduction
Mention serendipity to anyone anywhere and it congers up an immediate pleasurable reaction. 
Many have stories to tell about serendipitous moments when something materialized—an idea or 
opportunity—often from an interaction with an object or person in the immediate environment. 
Sometimes it appeared, as though by magic, as a lightning-bolt, thought-in-head. But, whatever it 
was, it was perceived as value-added, and not previously contemplated or considered. 
When we think of serendipity, we associate it first with scientific discoveries and inventions 
such as dynamite, rubber, penicillin, microwave, photography, X-rays, radioactivity, Liquorice All-
sorts, Post-it notes, Viagra, laughing gas, Velcro, Teflon, and Nylon. Arguably, Columbus’ discovery 
of North America occurred when he was looking for a new trade route to the Orient—a serendipi-
tous find. In this book, we start from those early explanations and understanding of serendipity and 
consider the concept in the context of digital information environments.
But when is something truly serendipitous? Serendipity is often associated with chance, 
blind luck, fortuitous events, and accidental coincidences, but these words are not synonymous with 
serendipity, as many authors have lamented (see, for example, De Rond, 2014; Merton and Barber, 
2004; Shaprio, 1986). As you will discover on reading this book, for an event, process, outcome, or 
experience to be serendipitous, it needs several conditions.
•	 A person is exposed to an object that is unusual, but is meaningfully unusual.
•	 The person has the sagacity to observe, identify, and extract elements from the object, 
and the mental space and tenacity to re-use them in a new way. 
•	 The outcome is unanticipated such that under normal circumstances it would not be 
predicted.
In short, we are looking at “planned insight coupled with unplanned events” (Fine and Dee-
gan, 1996, p. 435). There is an element of surprise and chance, but an element that can only be acted 
on by someone capable of understanding, extracting and using that chance finding.
Serendipity may have global impact such as the discoveries and inventions mentioned earlier. 
But equally it may be very individual such that the chance discovery enabled a similarly unexpected 
(to the person) find that may not have consequences beyond that person’s sphere.
In this chapter, we examine the concept of serendipity, its historic roots, its problematic no-
menclature, and how something that is characterized as serendipitous unfolds.

ORIGINS OF SERENDIPITY
Serendipity has its roots in the 18th century, but was not popularly used until the second half 
of the 20th century. Today a search of Google will net over 30 million occurrences, and Google 
Scholar outputs over 100,000 occurrences in the scholarly literature. This is in contrast with 
Merton and Barber (2004) who identified only 135 people from the word’s origin to the mid-
20th century who had used the word in print. Remarkably, there is no equivalent word in some 
languages (Martinez, 2011).
The first use of the word, serendipity, appeared in a letter dated January 28, 1754 from a man 
of letters and politician, Horace Walpole, known for his neologisms, to his friend and diplomat, 
Horace Mann. In that letter, Walpole was commenting on his search for an image about a Venetian 
coat of arms. He writes:
This discovery indeed is almost of that kind which I call serendipity, a very expressive 
word, which as I have nothing better to tell you, I shall endeavour to explain to you: you 
will understand it better by the derivation than by definition. I once read a silly fairy tale, 
called The Three Princes of Serendip: as their Highnesses travelled, they were always 
making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of: for 
instance, one of them discovered that a mule blind in the right eye had travelled the same 
road lately, because the grass was eaten only on the left side, where it was worse than on 
right—now do you understand serendipity? One of the most remarkable instances of this 
accidental sagacity (for you must observe that no discovery of a thing you are looking for 
comes under this description) was of my Lord Shaftsbury, who happening to dine at Lord 
Chancellor Clarendon’s, found out the marriage of the Duke of York and Mrs. Hyde, by 
the respect which her mother treated her at the table (as quoted in Remer, 1965, p. 6). 
The key point of the story is that three odd observations led the princes to identify the char-
acteristics of a mule even though they had neither seen the mule, nor were looking for a mule. It was 
a case of insightful observation and inference (Merton and Barber, 2004). Similarly, in the second 
also unusual example over dinner, shrewd observation coupled with sagacity led to an unexpected 
conclusion (and one would need to be an expert in the etiquette of the day to fully grasp the logic). 
Walpole’s seemingly innocuous reflections informed the concept of serendipity that we still use to 
this day, a concept that intertwines acute mental discernment and accident to explain a discovery.
Walpole’s concept remained a private communiqué between the two friends, until Walpole’s 
correspondence was published in the 1830s. It took another 40 years before the word resurfaced in 
a public medium. In 1875, it appeared in formal print in the English language in the journal Notes 
and Queries, where Edward Solly introduced it into literary groups (Merton and Barber, 2004). 
Even though many incidences of serendipitous findings occurred in science during this period (e.g., 
vulcanization of rubber, coal tar dye mauve), the word, serendipity, was not used to describe them. 

3
In 1909, serendipity had its first appearance in a dictionary, The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, 
(the precursor to the Encyclopedia Britannica) and in 1913 it appeared in the Oxford English Dictio-
nary. From the early 1900s to about 1935, serendipity remained used almost exclusively by literary 
scholars. In the mid-1930s, scientists and, in particular, Cannon (1945) at the Harvard Medical 
School popularized its role in scientific discovery (Merton and Barber, 2004). The pendulum swung 
from a dominant use in describing discoveries in science, although serendipity is now widely used 
throughout all disciplines.
In 1958, Merton and Barber wrote a detailed account of serendipity, but the book languished 
as a manuscript until 2004 when it was published shortly before Merton’s death. This work, how-
ever, remains the most comprehensive discussion of the concept. Since that time, Walpole’s “very 
expressive word” has entered everyday conversation to describe everything from surprises to random 
occurrences and unexplained but happy outcomes (Merton and Barber, 2004, p. 4). But we believe 
that the common use in everyday language has led to dilution in its meaning, which challenges its 
application in research.
1.2	
ON DEFINING SERENDIPITY
Part of the confusion over what is meant by serendipity can be attributed to Walpole (Remer, 1965; 
Merton and Barber, 2004) who did not make clear how the concept was to be defined and thus 
used. Merton and Barber (2004) examined its appearance in dictionaries from its conception to the 
end of the 20th century and concluded that it had been perceived as an “esoteric word” given that 
it did not appear in any of the abridged dictionaries until 1951. 
How it appears in dictionaries illustrates its lack of specificity as these examples demonstrate.
1.  An aptitude for making desirable discoveries by accident; good fortune; luck (“seren-
dipity,” n.d.-a).
2.  The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident; the fact or occurrence of such 
discoveries; an instance of making such a discovery (“serendipity,” n.d.-b).
3.  The faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for 
(“serendipity,” n.d.-c).
4.  The occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way 
(“serendipity,” n.d.-d).
5.  The faculty of finding valuable or interesting things by chance or where one least 
expects them (“serendipity,” 1932).
The challenge with these definitions is their use primarily of adjectives (e.g., desirable, fortu-
nate, valuable, agreeable, happy, interesting) that are difficult to operationalize. While the use of the 
1.2 ON DEFINING SERENDIPITY

1. INTRODUCTION
words faculty and aptitude in the definitions suggest ability on the part of the individual experi-
encing serendipity, sagacity and the prepared mind are missing, suggesting that to be serendipitous 
is, largely, to be lucky. From a research perspective, we need to deconstruct and operationalize the 
terminology so that we recognize the phenomena that we are investigating. For greater clarity, we 
look instead to how serendipity is deployed by those who research it.
For an incident to be described as serendipitous, or for an outcome to claim to be serendipity, 
it will have the following five conditions:
1.  There is an observation that is unanticipated, anomalous, unexpected, unpredictable, 
or inconsistent with existing findings or theories. This is a core condition and is gen-
erally agreed on by all who have researched serendipity (see, for example, Danzico, 
2010; Foster and Ford, 2003; Makri and Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and Toms, 
2015; Merton and Barber, 2004; Toms, 1997). But it is not the only characteristic. 
Many discussions of serendipity stop here, but in doing so interpret serendipity as 
simply synonymous with surprises and apparently happy random accidents; “without 
an element of chance, ‘discovery’ is nothing more than verification; without sagacity, 
it is mere happenstance” (Arvo, 1999, p. 183).
2.  The individual involved must have the human cognitive capacity and ability or knowl-
edge and experience to make that observation—the prepared mind—which is often 
an observation that many have failed to notice, recognize, or even consider. From 
penicillin to dynamite, and microwave ovens to Post-it notes and Velcro, the “know-
how” of the person making the observation is integral to the discovery. Chemist Paul 
Flory, on receiving the 1977 Perkin Medal, noted,
Significant inventions are not mere accidents. The erroneous view [that they are] is widely 
held, and it is one that the scientific and technical community, unfortunately, has done little 
to dispel. Happenstance usually plays a part, to be sure, but there is much more to invention 
than the popular notion of a bolt out of the blue. Knowledge in depth and in breadth are 
virtual prerequisites. Unless the mind is thoroughly charged beforehand, the proverbial spark 
of genius, if it should manifest itself, probably will find nothing to ignite (Flory, 1977, p. 4).
Similarly, medieval historian, Julian Luxford (2009) was researching two topics at 
once (sources for his book on medieval drawings and decoration in Carthusiasn 
manuscripts) when he stumbled upon a rare negative reference to Robin Hood in the 
marginalia of a 13th century medieval manuscript in the Eton school library. Even 
though other medieval scholars had examined the same manuscript, only he both rec-
ognized the find, and went on to write about the out-of-the-ordinary discovery. His 
knowledge of the era and context enabled him to recognize the value of the scribble. 

5
Pasteur astutely reached the same conclusion illustrated above a century earlier; it 
is not about luck and chance, but also about knowledge and experience. In a 1854 
speech to the Faculté des Sciences at Lille, Pasteur made his now famous quote in 
describing the discovery of the technology underlying the telegraph. As he relayed it, 
Orsted observed the movement of a magnetic needle “suddenly by chance, you might 
say, but remember, that in the sciences of observation, chance favors the mind which 
is prepared.” 1
In all of these cases there was an “intellectual preparedness” (Fine and Deegan, 1996) 
that enabled the researcher to understand the value of the observation, and then to 
allow for the “ah ha” moment to occur. If a person only sees what one is looking for, 
then one may miss the chance discovery.
3.  While the individual needs the ability based on knowledge and experience to sense 
the anomaly and its import, the individual also must have the human mental space at 
that time to absorb it, and recognize its value, and the perseverance to then act on it. 
Fleming (1964) in his 1945 Nobel speech described his discovery: 
...I prefer to tell the truth, that penicillin started as a chance observation. My only merit is 
that I did not neglect the observation and that I pursued the subject as a bacteriologist (p. 83). 
It takes a person in the right “mental space” to observe, interpret and seize the op-
portunity.
Surprises and accidents and incidental information encountering occur every day to 
everyone. But not everyone can turn that surprise or accident or new piece of infor-
mation into a significant outcome. From the examples mentioned earlier, how many 
other people were exposed to the same or similar set of circumstances but failed to 
see the relevance? “The “natural tendency of the unprepared mind is to discard the 
unusual” (Rosenau as quoted in Merton and Barber, 2004, p. 179).
Perhaps the most fitting example is the case of the floppy rabbit ears (Barber and 
Fox, 1958). Two eminent medical research groups separately and nearly simultane-
ously noticed that the normally stiff upright ears of rabbits flopped when the rabbits 
were injected with a particular enzyme. Both considered it abnormal and anomalous, 
and initially put the observation aside. Five years later, one of the researchers, Lewis 
Thomas, followed up on his curiosity noting that the enzyme also attacked the car-
tilage in bones and joints and led him to connect the observation to his interest in 
1  This is the English translation of the comment made in French: “a Dans les champs de l’observation le hazard 
ne favorise que les esprits préparés.”

1. INTRODUCTION
human disease and its relevance to rheumatoid arthritis and emphysema (Bashyam, 
2007). One researcher followed up on the observation, while the other ignored it. 
Both were equally capable and had the knowledge to pursue it.
4.  Incubation, consumption, and follow-up time is a factor in all phenomena described 
as serendipitous, and it is this factor which exacerbates our ability to research seren-
dipity. While we often delight in Archimedes “Eureka!” it is a rarity that an obser-
vation is made and a discovery is realized in the blink of an eye. There is a gestation 
period so that the anomaly or surprise can be explored, interpreted, and analyzed, as 
the case of the floppy ears attests; this aspect is typically attributed to the creative 
process (Herrmann, 1989). Pasteur was purported to have said “Let me tell you the 
secret that has led to my goal: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.” 
5.  There is a valuable outcome. In the sciences, it may have global ramifications such as 
the discovery of penicillin, radioactivity and smart dust. But at the individual level, 
it may lead to a change in direction, or personal problem solved. It is in the outcome 
that the relationship between serendipity and creativity become apparent: “creativity 
involves coming up with something novel, something different. And, in order to be 
interesting, it must be something intelligible and must relate to that which we know 
before” (Boden, 1996, p. 165), but it most likely will be something that no one has 
thought of before (Shaprio, 1986). However, serendipity is not a mirror image of the 
creative process; serendipity is a divergent process that may also discover a problem 
(Campos and de Figueiredo, 2002) that does not fit the usual creative process.
In summary, for an event, outcome or process to be serendipitous, it is initiated with an 
anomalous observation by a person who has the requisite skills to observe its irregularity, and the 
mental space to follow through on the observation, taking whatever requisite time is required to 
turn it into an unexpected finding. This is a time-tested process well documented in the physical 
world in science, medicine and technology in particular. This now serves as a basis for our exam-
ination of serendipity in digital information environments. Table 3.1 illustrates how five research 
groups who have studied serendipity in digital information environments have conceptualized the 
elements of serendipity primarily as a linear process, but influenced by additional elements. Chapter 
4 shows how we have adapted the physical world perspective described above to the digital infor-
mation environment.

1.3	
HOW SERENDIPITY HAPPENS
From the origins and use of the concept to date, three potential interpretations of how serendipity 
unfolds have emerged. They serve as a useful approach in understanding and deconstructing the 
process. Rather than enter that debate (e.g., is pseudo serendipity really serendipity?), we instead 
associate all three with serendipity although each has its supporters and naysayers. The three types 
are described below and illustrated in Figure 1.1. Examples are provided for each, all drawn from 
the sciences because they provide concrete illustrations of the three ways serendipity has been de-
scribed to date. These types will be further explored specifically in relation to digital information 
environments in Chapter 4.
•	 Type A. From Observations to Solution
An individual makes an observation that leads to the discovery of something novel; 
neither the observation nor the outcome is the objective of the investigation. This 
was the basis on which Walpole created the concept. In his description of the tale, 
the three princes were not looking for anything; they were able to solve a problem 
once they were presented with the clues. This has been described as abduction-“a 
form of reasoning to discover something new” (as discussed in Van Andel, 1994, p. 
636), but regardless of the reasoning process, Type A meets the five conditions dis-
cussed in Section 1.2. 
Examples:
ºº When Spencer stood near a magnetron, a vacuum tube that generates microwaves 
to boost the sensitivity of radar, he noted an odd sensation; the chocolate bar in 
his pocket had melted, and a bag of popcorn popped. A year later he had patented 
the technology for a microwave oven (e.g., Leslie, 2012);
ºº George de Mestral was out walking his dog when he noted the prickly seeds 
from shrubs that got caught in the fabric of his clothes, which led him to won-
der why which they stick, and after investigation to go on to invent Velcro (e.g., 
Pease et al., 2013)
Neither reportedly set out to solve the problems; they made astute observations which 
when combined with their own knowledge led to surprise outcomes. 
•	 Type B. From Problem I to a Solution for Problem II 
1.3 HOW SERENDIPITY HAPPENS

8
1. INTRODUCTION
In this variation, an individual is looking for a solution to a problem, but instead 
finds a solution to another problem. This is the interpretation of Solly and the literary 
scholars of the 19th century (and it was interpretation that was first quoted in the 
Oxford English Dictionary in 1913) and continues to be perhaps the most popular 
interpretation today.
Examples:
ºº Fleming was growing Staphylococcus bacteria in a petri dish when it became 
contaminated with a spore of Penicilliusm fungus. His deep understanding of 
bacteria (his sagacity) led him to observe how the mold in his petri dish killed the 
surrounding bacteria, and thus led to one of the most important advancements in 
health in the early 20th century (e.g., Roberts, 1989); 
ºº Art Fry was trying to develop a superglue when he accidentally devised a very 
weak glue that enabled two pieces of paper to be pried apart which led to devel-
opment of Post-it Notes (e.g., Pease et al., 2013).
In both these cases, the researchers were working diligently on a particular problem 
when an observation led them in a different direction, resulting in a novel solution to 
a problem that they had not initially intended to solve.
•	 Type C. Unexpected Solutions
An individual is looking for a solution to a particular problem, but the solution does 
not come from expected sources. The solution discovered by accident is found in an 
unusual or surprising way that could not have been predicted at the outset. This has 
also been called pseudo-serendipity (Roberts, 1989). 
Example:
ºº Goodyear was seeking a solution to the problem of rubber. In winter it hardened, 
while in summer it melted. As the story goes, he accidentally dropped rubber on a 
stove and observed on cooling that it turned into a charred leather-like substance 
with an elastic rim. From this unexpected event, he invented vulcanized rubber 
that is still in use today (e.g., Halacy, 1967).
Serendipity Types A, B, and C share common features as illustrated in Figure 1.1. In their 
examination of serendipity, de Figueiredo and Campos (2001) provide a parsimonious mathemat-
ical notation to describe each. The types are typically distinguished by whether there was intent to 

9
solve a problem or find a solution to a new or existing problem (Napier and Vuong, 2013; Foster 
and Ford, 2003; Cunha et al, 2014; De Rond, 2014). All types emerge out of a context, which may 
be any work or pleasure environment, with variable starting points, and all get to a solution; if this 
were the only ingredients, then we would be dealing with ordinary problem-solving. What distin-
guishes these types from ordinary problem solving are the two key points in the process:
•	 the startling, anomalous observation(s); that leads to
•	 an unexpected, unpredictable outcome. 
These elements, thus, become the defining characteristics that separate the ordinary from the 
serendipitous.

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY SERENDIPITY IN DIGITAL 
INFORMATION ENVIRONMENTS? 
A digital information environment can be any piece of digital technology that enables a “sense of 
place” and enables user interaction with information objects (McCay-Peet, Toms, and Kelloway, 
2014). This may be any software application, from desktop to the Web. How does this environ-
ment differ from those in which we typically discuss serendipity? Most examples from science and 
engineering described earlier deal with human interactions with physical objects that have visually 
revealing characteristics, e.g., mold, burrs, floppy ears, burning rubber. When the anomalous or un-
expected observation occurs in a two-dimensional digital space such as a computer, tablet or phone

display, those anomalous and unexpected cues emanate from a combination of text, icons, images 
and sounds that make up an information object, and thus must be cognitively interpreted. There are 
(at present) no tangible tactile elements in a digital environment. In this volume, it is this digital 
environment in which we explore serendipity.
1.5	
REST OF THE BOOK
In the remainder of the volume we consider the motivation for researching serendipity, and the 
value and implications for doing so. In Chapter 2, we examine why it is pertinent and timely to 
study serendipity. In Chapter 3, we deconstruct the concept of serendipity, and consider its use and 
interpretation, e.g., as an event, a behavior, a process, an outcome. In Chapter 4, we consider how 
to facilitate it in digital environments, answering the question can we design for serendipity. In 
Chapters 5 and 6, we look at how various methods have been deployed to study it and how it has 
been or could be assessed when it has occurred. We end the book with a reflection of the research 
to date and a framework for explaining the concept, thus providing a basis for future research.

CHAPTER  2 
What Drives Serendipity Research?
Reasons for examining the phenomenon of serendipity have evolved and grown over the past 25 
years. Rapid technological change has provided both impetus and inspiration for serendipity re-
search that examines how people adopt, adapt to, use, and, in turn, influence digital environments 
and how to design them to better support serendipity in the context of learning, everyday life, 
business, scholarship, law, and leisure, to name a few. The purpose of this chapter is to gather the 
main drivers of serendipity research, which point to responses to the proverbial “so what?” question.

We identified six main, overlapping drivers of serendipity research relating to digital infor-
mation environments (Figure 2.1).

2. WHAT DRIVES SERENDIPITY RESEARCH
•	 Physical vs. digital: Compare serendipity-related benefits of digital and physical in-
teractions or mimic characteristics of physical environments to support serendipity in 
digital environments. 
•	 Information overload: Develop digital environments that enable users to encounter 
triggers of serendipitous experiences in the face of information overload.
•	 Filter bubbles: Burst “filter bubbles” through novel approaches to support serendipity.
•	 User experience: Understand and foster the positive experiences associated with ser-
endipity to benefit individuals, groups, networks, and society. 
•	 User strategies: Identify how users may increase opportunities for serendipity through 
their information behavior or frame of mind in their interactions with digital envi-
ronments.
•	 Understanding the phenomenon: Gain a theoretical understanding of the phenom-
enon of serendipity.
Although not always explicitly stated in the research, these six drivers are tied to even broader 
incentives: the implications of support for serendipity reverberate politically, socially, economically, 
and technologically through serendipity’s relationship to, for example, learning, community build-
ing, and innovation. In the conclusion of this chapter we both summarize the research drivers and 
suggest others to which it has yet to turn its attention.
2.1	
PHYSICAL VS. DIGITAL
While the separation between “offline” and “online” or “virtual world” and “real world” networks 
and communities has become increasingly blurred, and arguments against the very existence of a 
division were proposed more than 10 years ago (e.g., Wellman, 2004), the qualities of interaction 
among people, information, and objects differ in physical vs. digital environments. The serendipitous 
sociocognitive microenvironment (Merton and Barber, 2004) needs, at the very least, some massaging 
when considering the relatively recent shift from physical to digital. Since the 1990s, research has 
examined how interactions with people and information differ in physical vs. digital environments 
and whether the positive, serendipitous aspects of physical environment may be mimicked or aug-
mented through our interactions with digital environments.
Discussion relating to the shift from physical to digital and its implications on serendipity 
and how digital can either replace or enhance our physical interactions is evident, for example, in 
relation to the shift from physical to digital photography, in approaches to humanities research, 
and the development of collaborative work environments. Research has sought to find ways in 

13
which digital photographs may be remembered and shared as easily, or perhaps more so, than their 
physical counterparts (Frohlich, Wall, and Kiddle, 2013; Nunes, Greenberg, and Neustaedter, 2009). 
Findings relating to serendipity in the humanities suggest unease over the shift from physical to 
digital source materials, although Verhoeven and de Costa (2014) note that this may dissipate 
with time through new methodological approaches and technological changes. Currently, however, 
among historians, research suggests that while more and more artifacts and manuscripts are be-
coming digitally accessible, there is apprehension that the shift from physical books to eBooks may 
reduce opportunity for serendipity rather than support it (Quan-Haase and Martin, 2012; Martin 
and Quan-Haase, 2013, 2016). In serendipity research relating to work or enterprise, the emphasis 
is often on co-workers’ information-rich interactions with each other and how the phenomenon 
may be facilitated by enabling informal online communication (e.g., Guy et al., 2015; Whittaker, 
Frohlich, and Daly-Jones, 1994). We focus in the remainder of this section on the work or enter-
prise area of research where the motivation for serendipity research has a distinctly physical vs. 
digital perspective: Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). 
Early CSCW research (e.g., Whittaker, Frohlich, and Daly-Jones, 1994) was motivated by 
findings indicating that physical proximity has a significant influence on opportunistic collabora-
tion among researchers (Kraut, Egido, and Galegher, 1988). Researchers at Hewlett Packard, for 
example, examined how informal communication, including communication prompted by “chance 
encounters,” could in some way be replicated online to support geographically distributed groups 
(Whittaker, Frohlich, and Daly-Jones, 1994). Jeffrey (2000) examined whether chance encounters 
occur in a “networked, virtual world with three-dimensional avatar representation” (p. 331) and 
found that chance encounters known to occur in physical environments can be reproduced in vir-
tual environments. CSCW continues to examine how to support serendipity through, for example, 
updates on fellow employees’ social media activity (Guy et al., 2015) and the implications of ser-
endipitous experiences in work environments such as enhanced communication and productivity 
(Brown et al., 2014). 
While researchers and developers are forging ahead with the development of approaches to 
increase the potential for serendipity in digital information environments, there is a recognition 
that technological support for serendipity is not quite “there yet,” as evidenced from moves by 
technologically sophisticated companies such as Yahoo!, Google, and IBM to encourage face-to-
face interactions among its employees (e.g., Lindsay, 2014; Silverman, 2013; Wolsen, 2013). Yahoo! 
made news in 2013 when CEO Marissa Mayer barred employees from working from home, a 
move widely held to be associated with the desire to increase productivity as well as the belief that 
serendipity, a driver of innovation, was more likely to occur through diverse, face-to-face interac-
tions with colleagues than at one’s home office or through online communication (Wolsen, 2013). 
Because face-to-face interactions were credited with innovations at the search engine giant Google, 
including Gmail and Street View, the company designed its headquarters to ensure its employees 
2.1 PHYSICAL VS. DIGITAL

14

could, according to a Google spokesperson, “collaborate and bump into each other” (Silverman, 
2013, n.p.). Similarly, IBM’s Accelerated Discovery Lab, with its open space and dynamic concept, 
was designed to ensure “cross-pollination” among colleagues from different disciplines and teams 
and visitors to the lab would have opportunities to interact with each other and big data. Laura 
Haas, the lab’s director of technology and operations, noted
We call it cultivating “strategic serendipity.” It’s those “A-ha!” moments you have in the shower 
or often around the water cooler. We want to bring people together in a rich enough environment 
they want to play in it, and then create serendipity by leveraging the connections in the room, 
the connections in the data, and our ability to see what users are doing (Lindsay, 2014, n.p.).
Currently, without a better alternative, high-tech companies continue to recognize the 
need for face-to-face interactions to facilitate serendipity. Regardless, however, of the push to get 
colleagues in the same room together through company policies and architectural design, a signif-
icant amount of worker interactions with data, information, and knowledge now take place online, 
through email, social media, search engines, databases, and other digital information resources and 
sources. Therefore, the need to get serendipity “right” in digital information environments is critical 
and continues to be a prime motivation for serendipity research. 
2.2	
INFORMATION OVERLOAD
One of the main benefits of digital information environments is the plethora of dynamic, diverse, 
and hyperlinked information that those environments contain, with the potential to trigger seren-
dipitous experiences. At the same time, some argue that this type of information-rich environment 
is just as likely to spur information overload as it is to trigger serendipity—arguably more so. This 
tension between the need to manage both the quantity and quality of information has been a key 
driver of serendipity research. How can digital environments provide a balance between manageable 
information exposure and drawing attention to information that may be considered unexpected 
but useful (i.e., serendipitous)? Relative to the information overload phenomenon, associated with 
enterprise time and money (Barta, 2014; International Data Corporation, 2001) as well as anxiety 
and stress (Erdelez, 1996; Yadamsuren and Heinström, 2011), a serendipitous digital environment 
must meet the demands of user experience like any other digital environment otherwise people will 
not stay or return (Åman et al., 2014). 
Information overload is a term “often used to convey the simple notion of receiving too much 
information” (Eppler and Mengis, 2004, p. 326). Research across a variety of disciplines indicates 
that the quality of individuals’ decisions correlates with the amount of information received, but 
only up to a point. Once that threshold is reached, information overload ensues as information 
can no longer be integrated into decision-making (Eppler and Mengis, 2004). Eppler and Mengis 
describe the inverted U-curve associated with this relationship between decision-making and in-

15
formation load, first articulated by Schroder, Driver, and Streufert (1967). In serendipity research, 
information overload is often referred to in related terms; a similar U-curve schematic can be 
imagined in which “decision-making” is replaced by “serendipity.” The more information provided 
in a digital information environment, the more opportunity for serendipity—but still, up to a point. 
Figure 2.2 illustrates the relationship between serendipity and information load that is often artic-
ulated in serendipity research as a phenomenon to be wary of and to limit by design (e.g., Bellotti 
et al., 2008; Cleverley and Burnett, 2015a; Guy et al., 2015; Rädle et al., 2012).

(adapted from Eppler and Mengis, 2004).
Serendipity research often seeks to address information overload by exploring how infor-
mation presented to users may be a combination of both serendipity as well as accuracy, often 
operationalized as unexpected and interesting or relevant information. For example, to prevent 
information overload without too narrowly defining the scope of what to present to users, Ruxanda, 
Nanopoulos, and Jensen (2010) balanced the criteria used to rank music retrieval results, which in-
cluded serendipity, authority, importance, and relevance, rather than simply audio similarity. Syndi-
cating enterprise social media streams has also been proposed to both reduce information overload 
among enterprise employees while also ensuring that employees are more apt to both view relevant 
content and have their content viewed by interested people (Guy et al., 2015). 
Providing options to users has also been proposed to give people some agency over how they 
would like to deal with the problem of information overload and, ultimately, to explicitly indicate 
their openness to serendipity at any given moment. For example, users may choose “serendipitous” 
over “known-item” search (Pittarello, 2004), indicate desired level of surprise in recommendations 
(Guy et al., 2015), control the level of diversity of suggestions (Benjamin, et al. 2014), change search 
parameters to shuffle and dynamically reorder event results (Nielsen et al., 2015), or have the power 
to turn context filtering for recommendations on or off (Bellotti et al., 2008). Similarly, transpar-
ency, indicating to users why, for example, a song has been recommended is also important when 
presenting less obvious, potentially more serendipitous, recommendations (Hornung et al., 2013).
2.2 INFORMATION OVERLOAD

16
2. WHAT DRIVES SERENDIPITY RESEARCH
While information overload is a common motivation for serendipity research, not all agree 
that information overload is a problem. De Bruijn and Spence (2008), for example, argue that, 
given the human capacity to rapidly process information (and forget it), rather than trying to avoid 
information overload, people need to be exposed to a large amount of information. This exposure is 
necessary if the goal is to increase opportunities for serendipitous access to information, balancing 
the need for personalization with the need to enable serendipitous interaction (Fan et al., 2012). 
Concern that people may be missing out on serendipitous opportunities because of filtering tech-
nology is precisely what led to another primary motivation for serendipity research: filter bubbles.
2.3	
FILTER BUBBLES
In their research on mobile technology, Jarvenpaa and Lang (2005) found that while technology 
provides solutions, it also tends to create new problems. The “fulfills needs/creates needs” paradox— 
“the same feature that fulfills a user need creates another one” (p. 13)—is evident in relation to the 
drive to support information search. To combat information overload, approaches to filtering and 
personalization and push-back behaviors and tools have been proposed (Morrison and Gomez, 
2014). But with advancements in technology that allow for filtering and personalization, come 
concern for the “filter bubbles” they may create (Pariser, 2011). Indeed, while filtering and person-
alization may help alleviate the problem of information overload, they are creating the potential 
for another problem: exposure to a narrow selection of information and ideas with which the user 
likely agrees or is already aware (Pariser, 2011). What are people missing out on when their searches 
are filtered and they are only exposed to the information, news, ideas, and products that conform 
to their location and click and search history (i.e., interests and beliefs)? Serendipity research is 
motivated not only to address the filter bubble problem (e.g., Benjamin et al., 2014; Kirman, Line-
han, and Lawson, 2012) but also to investigate whether this concern is well-founded (e.g., André, 
Teevan, and Dumais, 2009b). The latter, however, is often assumed, which makes it difficult to know 
the extent of the filter bubble problem. 
The debate around filter bubbles, however, is not only an academic one. Filter bubbles 
(Pariser, 2011) have been cited by the media in the aftermath of major political events such as the 
2016 referendum in the United Kingdom (Bell, 2016) and the 2016 American presidential elec-
tion (Rose-Stockwell, 2016) as the reason why so many were surprised with the outcomes. Those 
who felt the vote would be “no” to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and 
that Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump would win the presidential election in the US in 
2016 were at least partially getting this impression through the echo chambers they were inhab-
iting through their social media platforms. They were only hearing from people who shared their 
opinions and were exposed to the same news and information. Filter bubbles, it was proposed, may 

17
ultimately curtail exposure to diverse, novel information and ideas, and impact the potential for 
serendipity with political ramifications.
Filtering has been used for some time as a method of coping with information overload, 
focusing on specific, important information and the avoidance of unimportant information 
(Savolainen, 2007). In the context of search engines, “important information” is essentially precise 
or accurate search results. Research (e.g., André et al., 2009b; Forsblom et al., 2012; Huldtgren et 
al., 2014; Kirman et al., 2012; Maksai et al., 2015; Matt et al., 2014; Taramigkou et al., 2013; Zhang 
et al., 2012) has noted that improving the accuracy of search results and recommendations through 
filtering does not necessarily lead to better search experiences and these “improvements” have broad 
social and political implications (Pariser, 2011; Zuckerman, 2011). Forsblum et al. (2012) argue, for 
example, that people tend to be fed content that is similar to the content they are usually exposed 
to or content that is popular rather than novel or potentially serendipitous. André et al. (2009b) 
similarly indicate that personalization “may reduce opportunities for serendipity on the Web” 
(p. 2033), though ultimately argue that personalization may also be used to support serendipity. 
Huldtgren et al. (2014) suggests there has been a decline in serendipitous experiences that have 
the potential to broaden people’s perspectives not only due to filtering but also “an acceleration of 
everyday life through technology” (n.p.). Also concerning, Guy et al. (2015) found that while their 
personalization method for item recommendation within an enterprise social stream did not intend 
for personalized items to be predominantly authored by employees of the same country as their 
readers, they nonetheless found this algorithmic bias. All of these examples suggest the need to 
carefully examine how changes to digital environments interact with other factors and impact users. 
The FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) phenomenon has been channeled by serendipity research-
ers who are eager to ensure that while information overload is stemmed, it is not at the expense 
of serendipity. Evidence of FOMO was found in a serendipity-related study (Nielsen et al., 2015) 
in which participants wrongly assumed that sliders that allowed users to control the parameters 
of urban events were acting as filters, preventing them from seeing all possible events. Users need 
to know that the system is showing them all relevant events. Stemming FOMO is evident in 
Benjamin et al.’s (2014) motivation behind the development of Juxtapose, described as a “clipart 
composition workflow” (p. 342). Juxtapose was designed to both help users navigate the deluge 
of images available online and to ensure that the image retrieval algorithms, which have become 
very accurate in recent years, do not eliminate serendipity from the image search process. While 
algorithms are getting increasingly better at accuracy, pulling information that has the potential 
to spark serendipity may be a far greater challenge than selecting accurate information because 
the approach risks annoying users if the results are consistently neither accurate nor serendipitous 
(André et al., 2009a). 
Matt et al. (2014), however, recognizing the trade-off between providing recommendations 
that are relevant and perhaps even known to users and recommendations that do not fit their 
2.3 FILTER BUBBLES

18
2. WHAT DRIVES SERENDIPITY RESEARCH
previously noted preferences, tested the notion that people would want to break out of their filter 
bubbles. In their study on recommender systems in which 130 university students participated in 
a web-based field experiment, Matt et al. found that simply providing novel recommendations was 
not enough because of the cost novelty had to the perception of “preference fit”; rather, users were 
open to serendipitous recommendations, those that were both valuable and surprising, ultimately 
aligning with their interests and providing enjoyment. Regardless, filter bubbles continue to be a 
topic of discussion in the popular press and a driver of serendipity research. 
2.4	
USER EXPERIENCE
While serendipity is generally associated with positive experiences, serendipity involves work to 
reach some of the possible valuable outcomes of the experience (McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015) 
and thus serendipity is not always welcome. People may want to avoid serendipitous experiences 
due to time constraints (Makri et al., 2014; McBirnie, 2008; Sun et al., 2011) or stress and anxiety 
(Heinström, 2006; Yadamsuren and Heinström, 2011). Moreover, interest and relevance are dy-
namic rather than static, changing over time and through context (André et al., 2009b); stumbling 
upon a useful, unexpected search result may be considered serendipitous one day but not if it was 
found the very next day when the need has passed. Recognizing its time- and context-sensitive 
elements, some systems designed to support serendipity have been developed to allow for tasks to 
be deferred (Ahn and Pierce, 2005) to help improve user experience. With all its potential to drive 
some people away, serendipity is generally considered a positive experience and, by extension, a 
positive user experience. 
All three of the preceding drivers of serendipity research in digital environments (physical 
to digital; information overload; filter bubbles) are tied to user experience; they all underscore 
a determination to improve “a person’s perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or 
anticipated use of a product, system or service” (International Organization for Standardization 
[ISO], 2010, p. 3).The first driver outlined in this chapter (Section 2.1) focuses on the ongoing 
transition from physical to digital and the latter two (Sections 2.2 and 2.3) have been largely tied 
to pervasive problems relating to technological developments that have the potential to negatively 
impact user experience: information overload and filter bubbles. However, the ISO (2010) provides 
three notes on its definition of user experience that point to a myriad of factors that influence user 
experience including users’ goals, attitudes, prior states, and system functionality and usability. In 
this section, we highlight the aspect of user experience that “includes all the users’ emotions, beliefs, 
preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that 
occur before, during and after use” (p. 3). Serendipity research has framed the valuable outcomes of 
a serendipitous experience as personal, organizational or community, or global (McCay-Peet and 

19
Toms, 2015). Serendipity research relating to digital environments tends to focus on the first two, 
which are explored below.
Personal outcomes. On the level of personal outcomes or impact of support for serendipity, 
research examining how to improve user experience varies considerably. For example, serendip-
ity research has explored how to enhance user experience relating to search (e.g., Bordino et al., 
2014), sightseeing (Bellotti et al., 2008), and music selection and listening (e.g., Liikkanen and 
Åman, 2016; Leong, Vetere, and Howard, 2005; Leong et al., 2010). Bordino et al. (2014) argue 
the objective of modern search engines has evolved and is not only to deliver a set of documents 
but also an engaging experience that can stimulate creative thinking; serendipity is one way to keep 
users “interacting with the system even without a predefined purpose” (p. 2). Leong et al. (2010) 
found through their research on serendipity, digital music, and user experience “that at the heart of 
the experience of serendipity was the emergence of powerful personal meanings out of seemingly 
random coincidence of events” (p. 263). Zhang et al. (2012) found that by ensuring their music 
recommender system, Auralist, supported serendipity, they were able to improve user satisfaction, 
an important aspect of user experience. 
Organizational or community outcomes. Advancements in technology that support seren-
dipity have also been motivated by the desire to improve strength of family bonds (e.g., Bentley et 
al., 2011) or to understand the “serendipity of place” (Hristova et al., 2016). Bentley et al.’s (2011) 
Serendipitous Family Stories System was designed to encourage “communication across generations 
and enhance[e] users’ relationships with everyday places in their lives” (p. 31). A sense of community 
in geographically distributed workforces is partially dependent on opportunities for both casual and 
chance encounters among members (Renduchintala, 2006). Hristova et al. (2016) note that due 
to the ever-increasing number of people living in urban areas, urban planners as well as systems 
designers need to understand the affect that human mobility has on urban diversity; just how ser-
endipitous a place is, “the extent to which it can induce chance encounters between its visitors” (p. 
23) is an important aspect of social diversity. 
2.5	
USER STRATEGIES
While much of the research on serendipity in digital environments focuses on how user interfaces, 
mobile applications, and search and recommender system algorithms can facilitate serendipity 
(e.g., Taramigkou et al., 2017), there is a small body of research that examines the user side of 
this equation. While technology can be designed to provide opportunities for serendipity, namely, 
digital environments conducive to serendipitous experiences, the user also has a role to play; the 
user can adopt strategies, approaches, behaviors, or frames of mind when interacting with digital 
environments to increase the chances of experiencing serendipity. Stewart and Basic (2014) found 
that undergraduate students were failing to take advantage of their information encounters—they 
2.5 USER STRATEGIES

20
2. WHAT DRIVES SERENDIPITY RESEARCH
were not following up to ensure the valuable outcomes associated with serendipity despite the 
existence of built-in web tools to help them capture the information for later use. They concluded 
that undergraduate students needed information literacy training to understand how to “manage 
and retrieve unexpected information while using the internet” (p. 74). The process of a serendipitous 
experience is influenced by both environmental and human factors (e.g., Erdelez, 1996; Merton 
and Barber, 2004) and both must be taken into consideration in the development of serendipitous 
digital environments. To this end, another driver of serendipity research in the context of digital 
information environments relates to the development of strategies to enable users to increase the 
likelihood of serendipity. 
While there is some evidence of a link between the personality trait of extraversion and 
serendipity (McCay-Peet, Toms, and Kelloway, 2015) and incidental information acquisition (IIA) 
(Heinström, 2006), the approaches and strategies users take or apply to their interactions with in-
formation in digital environments appear to hold the most promise in complementing the develop-
ment of serendipitous digital information environments. Heinström (2006), for example, found that 
intrinsic motivation and engagement had a positive relationship to IIA—students in three separate 
studies who employed a “deep approach” to studying in which they built on their comprehension 
with each new piece of information were more likely to experience IIA. Search style, something 
that can be taught, is also associated with serendipity. Heinström (2006) found that broad scanning, 
“a search style where a topic is spontaneously explored through a wide use of sources” (p. 587) was 
positively associated with IIA, unlike deep diving, which requires a high level of focus, and fast surf-
ing, in which little effort is exerted in the information seeking process. Erdelez (1996) points out 
the potential for “non-encounters,” those who do not currently experience the positive implications 
of information encountering, to model the behavior or approaches of “super-encounters” who are 
sensitive to information in their environment while avoiding the pitfalls of information overload. 
Taking a different tack, Makri et al. (2014) explored how strategies may inform the design of 
serendipity digital environments. Through interviews with 14 creative professionals, they explored 
the strategies that professionals reported they used to increase their likelihood of serendipity. Makri 
et al. (2014) noted several strategies through which they identified how current digital environ-
ments support serendipity and how the creative professionals’ strategies may in turn inform the 
development of environments that support serendipity. It seems investigating user strategies that 
increase opportunity for serendipity may not only inform information literacy training but also help 
improve digital information environments, enhancing their ability to support serendipity. Rahman 
and Wilson (2015) note, for example, the possibility of supporting two types of search behav-
ior-“casual searching” and “focused work tasks” through the design of serendipitous user interfaces.

21
2.6	
UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON
Finally, understanding the phenomenon—investigating the theoretical underpinnings of serendip-
ity—is a key motivation for serendipity research. This line of inquiry, which seeks to understand 
how serendipity unfolds, what influences it, and its implications through the development of 
models and frameworks, provides the ground work for research on serendipity to develop. Models 
and frameworks in the area of information needs, behavior, and use as well as the computational 
context have been developed to explain serendipity, propose recommendations and heuristics to 
practitioners, and help point to gaps in the literature.
The phenomenon of serendipity, despite its information-rich nature, has been largely ab-
sent from general information models and frameworks relating to information needs, seeking, 
and use. While parts of the experience of serendipity are captured in information models such 
as Ellis’ (2005) information seeking behavior, and Dervin’s (Dervin and Foreman-Wernet, 2003) 
sense making models, “no single general model of information explains serendipity” (McCay-Peet 
and Toms, 2015, p. 1464). Models and frameworks have sought to put the spotlight on the phe-
nomenon or aspects of the phenomenon to help explain, for example, information encountering 
(Erdelez, 1997; 2005), incidental information acquisition in everyday life (Williamson, 1998), 
everyday chance encounters (Rubin, Burkell, and Quan-Haase, 2011), the nature of serendipity 
in information research (Sun et al., 2011), the process of serendipity (Makri and Blandford, 2012; 
McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015), and micro-serendipity (Boger and Björneborn, 2013). 
Several models of the process or experience of serendipity have been developed and are dis-
cussed in Chapter 3 (also see Table 3.1); there are more similarities than differences among them. 
While different models and frameworks place different emphasis on the various elements of the 
phenomenon due to context (e.g., recommender systems, search, social media, everyday life), they 
all help to build consensus on the main elements of the phenomenon which is useful not only to 
future research but to practitioners trying to find ways to support serendipity. Serendipity research, 
however, is still in its infancy, and understanding the phenomenon will continue to be a primary 
research driver.

SUMMARY
The treatment of technology and its relationship with serendipity has changed in the past 25 years, 
moving from a broad conceptualization of opportunities for serendipity in physical versus digital 
information environments to a more nuanced approach that reflects the increasing complexity of 
technology and our interactions with and perceptions of it. This chapter discussed six overlapping 
drivers of serendipity research as they have been articulated to date: (1) map physical to digital; (2) 
reduce information overload; (3) burst filter bubbles; (4) improve user experience; (5) identify user 
strategies to facilitate serendipitous experiences; and (6) understand the phenomenon in order to 
2.7 SUMMARY

build theory, provide recommendations to practitioners, and identify gaps in the research. There will 
likely be more motivations for serendipity research on the horizon as digital information environ-
ments and the nature and degree of their use continue to evolve. 
It is important to note that underlying the six drivers in relation to the research on serendip-
ity in digital environments is the notion that digital environments have the potential to facilitate 
serendipity and some may do it better than others (e.g., Cleverley and Burnett, 2015a; McCay-Peet, 
Toms, and Kelloway, 2015). However, owing to the complexity of context, serendipity in digital 
environments may be viewed by users as either good or bad so extra care must be taken for its sup-
port. Moreover, while tools may be designed to support serendipity, they are doing so because it is 
believed that support for serendipity is a means to an end-a way to ensure, for example, good user 
experience, the bursting of filter bubbles, and the identification of positive user strategies. One of 
the lessons of serendipity research is that trying to solve a problem may create new ones, therefore, 
research must be conscious of the impact “improvements” are having. For example, what are the 
ethical implications of facilitating serendipity? We know algorithms are not neutral; what ethical 
issues do systems that purport to facilitate serendipity raise? The ethics of support for serendipity 
has yet to be fully explored. What forms of algorithmic bias should we be aware of in relation to 
support for serendipity? Are systems designed to support serendipity (e.g., by presenting diverse 
recommendations) more ethical than those that narrowly define interests (see, for example, Jones, 
2015)? What are the privacy implications of personalization designed to support serendipity; is the 
tradeoff worth it? Research on serendipity rarely addresses these broader ethical issues (exceptions 
include, for example, Hangal, Nagpal, and Lam, 2012).

CHAPTER  3 
Approaches to Serendipity 
While dichotomized as either a personal aptitude or a phenomenon or event (Merton and Barber, 
2004), a review of the serendipity research relating to digital environments reveals that serendipity 
is primarily approached as either a
1.  quality of an event, something, or someone; or a
2.  process or experience, which has one or more serendipitous qualities.
Serendipity as a process or experience is the most holistic approach to serendipity, capturing 
not only the moment of discovery or realization but what triggered the experience and followed, all 
centered around the person who experienced it. On the other hand, approached as a quality, four 
main types are discernable, including the qualities of
•	 an event (e.g., the act of stumbling upon a useful link);
•	 something (e.g., a useful and unexpected search result or recommendation); or
•	 someone (e.g., the openness of an individual to an unexpected experience or event; a 
fruitful search tactic that prompts serendipity)
What is most apparent in a review of the prior research on serendipity in the context of dig-
ital environments is that serendipity is often approached as a process or experience in information 
science and human-computer interaction research (Makri and Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and 
Toms, 2015; Rubin, Burkell, and Quan-Haase, 2011; Sun et al., 2011) or a quality of someone in 
information behavior research (e.g., Yadamsuren and Erdelez, 2010, 2016). However, in research 
relating to recommender systems and search engines, serendipity is most often approached as a 
quality of an event or something, with research effectively carving off a specific aspect of the process 
or experience to take a closer look and solve a specific problem (exceptions include Corneli, et al., 
2016; Taramigkou, Apostolou, and Mentzas, 2017).
The distinctions among the various approaches are important; namely, they reveal what 
underlying factors are hypothesized to contribute to serendipity or, at the very least, the primary 
focus of the research at hand. Each of the various ways in which serendipity has been interpreted 
in research adds to an understanding of the phenomenon, draws attention to one or more of its 
facets, and helps explain how it may be facilitated. The following sections explore serendipity first 
as a process or experience and then as a quality in its four main forms.

24
3. APPROACHES TO SERENDIPITY
3.1	
SERENDIPITY AS A PROCESS OR EXPERIENCE
Serendipity is sometimes characterized holistically as an experience, “the process of doing and see-
ing things and of having things happen to you” (Experience, n.d.). Several models of the process 
or experience of serendipity have emerged in recent years, driven primarily by the motivation to 
understand serendipity and what might facilitate it relating to its various elements or stages. From 
research focusing on serendipity in both digital and non-digital information environments, the 
phenomenon is generally approached as a process or experience to understand serendipity from 
the user’s perspective rather than a strictly systems approach (e.g., Corneli, et al., 2016; Makri and 
Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015; Rubin et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011). Table 3.1 
outlines the main elements of serendipity models.
	 What is evident from an analysis of the elements of various serendipity models (Table 3.1) 
is that there is a great deal of agreement among the models of what constitutes serendipity. Three 
main stages are evident in most of the models: (1) trigger/connection; (2) follow-up; and (3) valu-
able outcome/reflection. The trigger/connection and valuable outcome elements are present in all 
five models in one form or another. Something or someone must be the catalyst for the experience 
(i.e., trigger), the user must make a connection between the trigger and their knowledge or experience 
(i.e., prepared mind), and it must have a valuable outcome because, after all, serendipity is by nature 
a positive experience. While framed in different ways, the chance or unexpectedness of the experi-
ence, critical to the definition of serendipity, is also noted in each model. Three of the five models 
include perception or consideration of serendipity or reflection on the experience or reframing of 
events (Makri and Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015; Rubin et al., 2011). Perception 
or reflection is important in the context of support for digital environments; applications, websites, 
recommender systems, etc. may be designed to facilitate serendipity, but do they succeed from a user 
perspective? Three of the five models also include some sort of follow-up or bridge to the valuable 
outcome (Corneli, et al., 2016; Makri and Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015), under-
lining the importance of work to reach a valuable outcome as well as the need to provide features 
in digital environments to support follow-up, for example sharing features first noted almost two 
decades ago by Erdelez and Rioux (2000a, 2000b) relative to information encountering. 
What needs to be augmented in models and frameworks of serendipity are the factors that 
influence the process or experience. Qualities and characteristics relating to each of the main ele-
ments all hold the key to filling out and ultimately helping to combine models of serendipity from 
various fields of research. The following section outlines the three main qualities identified in the 
research—serendipity as a quality of an event, something, or someone. The serendipitous qualities 
of something (e.g., recommendations, search results) and event, for example, help explain the trig-
ger and connections elements of the process, while serendipitous qualities of someone may help

explain different part of the process, for example, how the trigger is encountered (e.g., search style), 
prepared mind, and whether the experience is perceived serendipitous. 
3.2	
SERENDIPITY AS A QUALITY
Serendipity is most often treated in the research as “a characteristic or feature that someone or 
something has: something that can be noticed as a part of a person or a thing” (Quality, n.d.); more 
specifically, as a quality of an event, something, or someone. By far, however, more research has 
examined serendipity as a quality of an event or something due to the proliferation of literature re-
lating to search engines and recommender systems in which serendipitous is used to describe initial 
“events” that take place within the process of serendipity (e.g., information encounters) or “things” 
such as search results and recommendations. Less common is serendipity approached in research 
relating to digital environments as a quality of someone; the focus of serendipity research tends to be 
more systems than user-centric in the sense that much of the research is about how serendipity may 
be supported by creating, for example, search user interfaces, for users rather than understanding 
qualities of the users themselves (e.g., personality, whether they are prone to serendipity) or what 
the user may bring to the table (e.g., their strategies for experiencing serendipity; search behaviors). 
The sections to follow describe the treatment of serendipity as an event, something, or someone 
throughout the literature of serendipity in digital environments.
Quality of an event. Most formal definitions of serendipity describe serendipity as an oc-
currence, an event, “something, (especially something important or notable) that happens” (Event, 
n.d.). Serendipity, in this vein, is often a quality of an encounter (e.g., Åman et al., 2014), an 
interaction (Jeffrey, 2000), a discovery (e.g., Bordino et al., 2014), or a specific type of event or 
interaction—a conversation (e.g., Inkpen et al., 2008). Words like event, accident, interaction, ex-
posure, acquisition, and discovery are often used interchangeably with the same research papers to 
describe serendipity. Åman et al. (2014) define serendipity in the context of their research on music 
recommendations as “random encounters of good or useful content unexpectedly” (p. 62, emphasis 
added) and also describe as “serendipitous music discoveries” (p. 69). Some research focuses on the 
information behavior that underlines these events rather than the event itself (e.g., Erdelez’s [2004] 
information encountering); this research is discussed in a forthcoming section on serendipity as a 
quality of someone. 
Defining serendipity as an event is most evident in research in the computer sciences where 
operationalizing an aspect of the experience of serendipity is necessary to solve a specific problem, 
such how to trigger serendipity (e.g., André et al., 2009b). Another pattern that became apparent 
was that when serendipity was defined as an event, it would often be subsequently treated as a 
quality of something (e.g., Liikkanen and Åman, 2016). Table 3.2 includes a selection of ways in 
which serendipity has been approached as an event in the research.

3. APPROACHES TO SERENDIPITY
Quality of something. In serendipity research, as previously mentioned, embedded within the 
events described in Table 3.2 are often more specific descriptions of the qualities of the entities in-
volved—the things encountered including the verbal, textual, or visual cues that trigger serendipity 
(McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015). Research often introduces serendipity as an event before focusing 
on these cues. The following section explores serendipity as a quality of something, the cues that 
prompt the experience of serendipity.
Various areas of computer science research (e.g., recommender systems, information re-
trieval) primarily approach serendipity as a quality of something, zeroing in on a specific problem 
to solve—namely improving user experience, reducing information overload, and bursting filter 
bubbles through the entities brought to users’ attention (e.g., places, documents, photos, news sto-
ries). For example, Kotkov et al. (2016) pointed out that recommender system research carves off 
the “trigger” element of serendipity, defining a serendipitous item as relevant, novel and unexpected 
from the user perspective (Corneli et al., 2016).
Quality of “something” may be a social network (Jang, Choe, and Song, 2011) or digital 
environment (e.g., Renduchintala, Kelliher, and Sundaram, 2006). However, most prevalent is the 
quality of a recommendation or search result as serendipitous, reflecting the increasing amount 
of research on serendipity relating to recommender systems in the past few years. In general, this 
research is designed to test whether, for example, a mobile application, search engine, or recom-
mender system facilitates serendipity. Zhang et al. (2012), for example, developed the Auralist, a 
music recommender, with the intent of balancing what they describe as conflicting goals of accu-
racy, diversity, novelty, and serendipity, to mimic what a friend or expert might recommend. Zhang 
et al. found that perceived serendipity is “usually, but not consistently, a positive contributor” (p. 21) 
to overall satisfaction, though this may be affected by factors external to the system (e.g., emotional 
state of the user). Zhang et al.’s findings contrast with findings by Ziegler et al. (2014) who found 
that serendipity and recommendation quality were negatively correlated. Ziegler et al. concluded 
that a better understanding of the “nature of serendipity” is needed moving forward to improve the 
quality of recommendations.

Quality of someone. A growing body of research relates to serendipity as a quality of some-
one (Table 3.3). The quality of someone encompasses people’s tendency to experience serendipity 
due to, for example, their personality traits or their behavior (either intentional or unintentional). 
Serendipity research relating to information behavior is much more common than research exam-
ining personality traits.
Only a handful of research has explored the personality traits of openness to experience and 
extraversion, for example, in relation to how frequently serendipity is experienced (e.g., Heinström, 
2006; McCay-Peet, Toms, and Kelloway, 2015). While McCay-Peet at al. (2015) found no signif-
3.2 SERENDIPITY AS A QUALITY

30
3. APPROACHES TO SERENDIPITY
icant relationship between reported frequency of serendipity in digital information environments 
and openness to experience or extraversion, Heinström (2006) did find a significant relationship 
between extraversion and students’ propensity to experience incidental information acquisition. 
More research is needed to understand how personality traits may influence serendipity as these 
too may inform what behaviors and frames of mind users may adopt to increase their opportunity 
for serendipity as desired.
Erdelez (1996, 1997, 1999) was among the first to explore what made some people more 
“serendipity-prone” (Merton and Barber, 2004) than others (see also Barber and Fox, 1958). 
Erdelez identified four types of information users who differ according to their perceptions of 
information encountering:
1.  non-encounters, 
2.  occasional encounterers, 
3.  encounterers, and 
4.  super-encounters. 
The four groups differ in the degree to which they encounter information, the extent that 
they can recall these encounters, their perception of the importance of information encounters, and 
their recognition of how their information encounters relate to their information behaviors. Su-
per-encounters are of particular interest in the context of user strategies, as their behavior is worth 
emulating; a propensity to not only encounter information important to them but to encounter 
information that is important to family, friends, and colleagues (Erdelez, 1999). User strategies may 
involve, for example, the use of widely available sharing tools to share information encountered with 
friends, family, and colleagues (Erdelez and Rioux, 2000a, 2000b). Rather than relying solely on the 
digital environment to serve up serendipitous experiences, how can users gain control over their 
experience through their own online strategies and behaviors? 
Serendipity is often framed as a behavior. Incidental exposure to online news, for example, 
related to incidental acquisition of information and information encountering, is referred to as a 
behavior (Yadamsuren and Erdelez, 2010). Because behaviors lead to serendipitous experiences, it 
is not surprising that serendipity has been characterized as a method, “a way of doing something” 
(“Method”, n.d.) or behavior, “a way a person […] acts or behaves” (“Behavior”, n.d.). Seeking 
serendipity, trying to exert some control over a process, which is, by definition, unexpected, is a 
paradox (e.g., see McBirnie, 2008). However, even if aided through conscious behaviors or search 
strategies, research indicates that people may still perceive experiences as serendipitous (e.g., Martin 
and Quan-Haase, 2016; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015). Frohlich, Wall, and Kiddle (2013) found 
there was a need to support “serendipitous browsing of photographs.” So, rather than the emphasis 
on the photos, the things, the emphasis was on what behavior could be supported. Kirman et al.’s 

31
(2012) GetLostBot issues challenges to users in the form of mysterious walking directions, which 
are only provided when the user has fallen into a routine. It has the potential to both make people 
aware of their behavior and possibly change it, encouraging people to explore more.

Drivers of serendipity research play a large part in how serendipity is defined and approached across 
various fields of research and practice (e.g., human-computer interaction, interactive information 
retrieval, recommender systems, information science). A review of the research indicates that 
3.3 SUMMARY

3. APPROACHES TO SERENDIPITY
serendipity is approached as a process or experience and as a quality (of an event, something, or 
someone). However, a lack of systematic definitions of serendipity and related concepts in reports 
of research and a lack of consensus on definitions, have been noted (e.g., Kotkov et al., 2016); both 
shortfalls make it difficult to build theory. Moreover, inconsistencies exacerbated by the fact that 
the various disciplines and fields examining serendipity (e.g., information behavior, recommender 
systems) appear to be working in silos—odd considering the boundary-crossing often required to 
spark the very phenomenon under investigation.

CHAPTER  4 
Facilitating Serendipity 
4.1	
INTRODUCTION
Serendipity is not a task; but as illustrated thus far, it is a by-product of performing other activities 
or tasks, and indeed could characterize the successful outcome of a task. One does not develop a 
serendipity application. While some (e.g. Van Andel, 1994) argue that one cannot engineer seren-
dipity, others (e.g., Cunha, 2005; Campos and de Figueiredo, 2002) are not quite so definitive. We 
agree that one cannot “create serendipity” as to do so would render any output non-serendipitous, 
but we can create a fertile environment in which serendipity may flourish, and create specialized 
tools that may partially support the emergence of a serendipitous outcome (e.g., Leong et al, 2010; 
Liang, 2012). 
In this chapter, we first examine how users engage with digital environments, and next exam-
ine how serendipity materializes within those environments. Finally, we examine the design issues 
and challenges that are needed to create serendipity-prone environments. 
4.2	
INTERACTION IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS
As described in Chapter 1, a digital environment gives one a sense of place and purpose, enabling 
user interaction with a variety of information objects. This may be information search systems, col-
laborative work systems, social media, digital libraries, or any work task application. Virtually any 
interactive digital space provides opportunities for potentially serendipitous interactions (in much 
the same way that the physical world does).
The process of user interaction with a digital environment was described decades ago by 
Norman and Draper (1986): while engaged with an interactive system, a person formulates a goal, 
which is converted into an intention that is initiated by an action using an interface mechanism. 
Once the system responds, the user interprets and evaluates the response and compares it to the 
original goal before proceeding. This operates at the level of a single user-input/system-response. 
That is, it can be perceived at the level of typing a character to form a word and interpreting that 
character before the next character is typed. It can also be interpreted at a larger granular level. 
For example, a user needs to find a hotel, turns that goal into an intention to search the web, and 
enters the query into a search box; when the system responds, the user interprets and evaluates the 
result to ascertain whether the response meets the original goal. Many sequences of this cycle occur

throughout any user-system interactive session (and often the user is in automatic processing, and 
unaware of each of these seemingly painstaking steps) (Figure 4.1).

These sequences of interactivity occur in a two-dimensional space that varies in size by device 
(e.g., phone, tablet, desktop). That space becomes the user’s window into a virtual world. Through 
that window, the user views and interacts with a rich tapestry of options that are implemented using 
primarily textual content, from menu options to bullets and paragraphs of text; visual cues repre-
sented by color, icons, and still or moving images; and sounds, from conversation to audio signals. 
Successful interaction in this space occurs when the system meets the user’s mental model of that 
system, enabling a smooth communication between the two.
Given the limitations of a display, the user can only engage with that which is detectable 
(through visual or auditory cues), and can be understood or manipulated. The user needs to inter-
pret the affordances of each object on that display, and additionally the textual affordances of each 
element of text. The challenge lies in the physical constraints of a display. Much like an iceberg with 
90% of the mass underwater, almost any information system has a limited portion of its content vis-
ible at the “surface” (i.e., the interface) at any moment. Think of this with respect to Twitter, Google, 
GOV.UK, or even a “bank machine.” Success for the user depends on how well the user can engage 
with a restricted set of visible objects to connect with those “below the surface.”

35
Integral to this digital environment is the specific application that enables the task or work 
to be completed. This may be as mundane as word processing or as complex as a digital library, or 
a collaborative work system. This is analogically a task “layer” imposed on the system (although in 
reality it is more integrated than that). The range of possible actions becomes three-dimensional 
if one thinks of the elaborate data structure that interconnects the myriad of processes and ob-
jects. Only a small portion is ever visible to the user at a point in time, and that portion provides 
pathways and channels through the content of the system. For example, Google’s sparse interface 
provides a single pathway (the search box) that interconnects with multiple other pathways (the 
results lists and filters). Somewhat similar, Twitter’s and Instagram’s hashtags provide a seemingly 
infinite number of interconnecting routes among content. But regardless of the task environment, 
the same user-input/system-response is the enabler of that interactivity, and the user can only view 
that which is visible at any moment in time.

Toms, 1997).
When the user views this display in a specific task environment (e.g., Google, Twitter, a bank 
machine), the user needs to interpret the visible objects, deducing what each object and element 
of text (e.g., menu, titles) might mean. How the user proceeds will depend on the purpose of the 
interaction, from a targeted goal-focused task to a non-goal (or browse-based) mode, and whether 
this is a repetitive set of actions in a familiar environment or an infrequently used or novel system. 
But regardless of these issues, the user selects an object (eye gaze or formal mouse click), notes the 
cues emanating from the display which now act as an attention getting stimulus, and interprets 
and extracts any information bearing content to ascertain next steps. This digital instant (Toms 
1997) occurs many times in the course of a session (see Figure 4.2). Sometimes these cues may be 
“landmarks” denoting position and place within system navigation, and sometimes these are textual 
affordances that the user interprets based on prior knowledge and experiences. Alternatively, the 
user may discount cues that are perceived as “window dressing” (e.g., advertisement, familiar web-
site titles), and instead focus on those elements representing the actions the user wishes to take to

satisfy that initial goal. This combined physical-virtual world is the one in which we need to enable 
serendipity to happen.
4.3	
HOW SERENDIPITY HAPPENS IN DIGITAL 
ENVIRONMENTS
Given the explanation in the previous section, the user can only respond to cues present at the in-
terface, and the system can only change those cues, based on what it knows or can predict about the 
user, or in response to some user action. It is at the point of those cues where the chance encounter 
with an anomaly or unexpected textual affordance is likely to occur. As illustrated in Figure 4.3, 
those cues serve as the trigger, enabling a novel observation. If the user acts on that cue, informa-
tion encounter (Erdelez, 2000), or chance encounter (Toms, 2000b), then the cue may trigger an 
insight or curiosity and thus, the user may be on the pathway to a serendipitous finding. If the user 
ignores and discounts it, then it may be a lost opportunity. Once the user makes that observation, 
the user needs to process the cue, identifying any association or relationships; this may, in the digital 
environment, result in a faster response than the examples we have seen in science (see Chapter 1). 
That is, the incubation period may be short. The bisociation, a creative association between disparate 
pieces of information (Cunha, 2005; Koestler, 1964), may be computer-supported by specialized 
tools to aid the user in understanding the phenomenon (e.g., visualizations that juxtapose differing 
types of data), and the unexpected finding may be further computer-supported by showing the 
outcomes of the various bisociations as well as predicting a novel outcome. Ultimately, it will be the 
user who determines which outcome to act on, and it is at this point that we can describe something 
as merely problem solving or as serendipitous, something that resulted from that chance encounter 
with a trigger.
As described in Chapter 1, serendipity (as observed in science and engineering) tends to 
follow three patterns, and we argue that these patterns also occur in the digital environment (until 
a logical argument can be made to refute them). The application in a digital environment comes 
with some variations that pertain to the structure of that environment.

Type A. From Observations to Solution
A person may be browsing the Web in an indiscriminate fashion from link to link, or reading and 
following the links in a newspaper, collecting bits of information as one progresses. The consump-
tion of those bits of information leads to a novel discovery. 
Type B. From Problem I to a Solution to Problem II 
A person may be actively engaged in solving a problem, perhaps pursing an idea for a proposal 
or thesis, or planning a vacation. While following the usual leads, the person is presented with an 
unusual cue that triggers a change in focus that deviates from the planned and predicted pathway. 
The new pathway now may lead to new information about a different project, or perhaps a recipe for 
dinner. In this case that anomalous chance encounter which appears totally out of character leads 
4.3 HOW SERENDIPITY HAPPENS IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS

38
4. FACILITATING SERENDIPITY
to a surprise finding. By attending to the anomalous cue, the person finds a solution to something 
that was not the problem being pursued.
Type C. Unexpected Solutions
A person may be actively engaged in solving a problem, perhaps pursing an idea for a proposal or 
thesis, or planning a vacation and is working through a logical process when exposure to something 
unexpected triggers a different focus for the proposal or thesis, or vacation, none of which had been 
previously entertained.
Unlike the examples discussed earlier in Chapter 1, in the case of digital environments, the 
key facilitator (other than human sagacity) is the system (a word used in this chapter to refer to any 
piece of technology or application), and what/how it presents to the user. As illustrated in Figure 
4.3, a user interacts with a system using the interface tools and the dynamic content supplied. In the 
case of Type A, the user has no purpose, but in Types B and C, the user has a core issue to resolve. 
In all three types, the user notes an element of the display, which serves as the trigger, causing the 
user to pause and consider it; this cue is unexpected and anomalous. The user may follow-up imme-
diately and fully understand the value, or the user may store this new information for later digestion, 
which allows the cue to percolate until fully understood. At some point, the user will make the 
connection — the “ah ha” moment—the bisociation. If it occurs instantaneously, it may influence 
immediate user interactions; if it occurs at a later time, the user may return to the system or another 
system, or recognize the connection external to any system. Once it has occurred than the next step 
is the manipulation or modification of that connection to formulate a novel serendipitous solution.
4.4	
DESIGN ISSUES AND REQUIREMENTS
Within user-system interaction in a digital environment, the conditions identified in Chapter 1 
still hold.
1.  There will be an observation of some visual (or auditory) stimuli that is unanticipated 
and anomalous;
2.  The user must have the human cognitive capability and knowledge to recognize the 
anomalous state; and, additionally, 
3.  The mental space at that time to absorb it.
4.  The incubation and consumption time required to “connect the dots” may be almost 
instantaneous occurring within a single user session, or it may take time and tenacity 
external to the system for the user to process.

39
5.  There will be a significant outcome that also may occur external to the system.
Clearly, until humans have bionic inserts or some form of digital augmentation that enhance 
human capability, conditions (b) and (c) are outside system capabilities. The system does not know 
what the user is thinking, and is still unable to know precisely what experiences a user has had 
since the last interaction with the system. Paradoxically, the system is quite limited, having only 
the capability to respond to what it knows about the human or respond to human input, although 
the system may influence and stimulate the human. Much has been written about creativity and 
the creative process as well as how people create meaning or interpret the elements of a situation. 
Where the system stops and the human starts is a grey area. What goes on inside the human head 
and simple human capabilities and limitations are outside the scope of this book. Thus, the system 
is the supporting actor, the apprentice and personal assistant, albeit a very smart one, in this process.
Instead, the more productive approach is in facilitating the other three conditions as func-
tional requirements of any system for which serendipitous outcomes are considered an advantage:
1.  enabling the “anomaly” or the chance encounter to trigger an event; this is indeed 
what most of the solutions discussed in the next section have strived to achieve; 
2.  supporting the user in “connecting the dots,” that is, identifying the relationship be-
tween the cue and what is percolating inside the user’s head, or showing relationships 
between the cue and other incongruent elements; and 
3.  supporting the user in reaching a significant surprise outcome; this also has been 
rarely if ever attempted. 
Thus, these become the functions required for computer support of human activities that 
may lead to serendipitous outcomes. These are not simple for systems that run on logic and rules 
that converge on a solution to develop. However, a computer can run through many variations 
abiding loosely by human rules to emerge with unimaginable possibilities for the human subse-
quently to consider. 
4.5	
OPERATIONALIZING THOSE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
To date, we have no set of systematic requirements for achieving a system that facilitates serendipity. 
Any system that supports serendipity must be able to facilitate those three functions identified in 
the last section. But the challenge is in how to operationally achieve any of them. 
Van Andel (1994) identified 17 patterns (e.g., analogy, successful error, playing) from his 
analysis of over 1,000 serendipitous outcomes, which may be, given the date of publication, safely 
described as outcomes facilitated by non-digital information environments. Some such as anal-
ogy may be semi-automated in a digital environment, while others are simply descriptive. Toms 
4.5 OPERATIONALIZING THOSE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

40
4. FACILITATING SERENDIPITY
(2000a) proposed four techniques to support serendipity after observing around 50 participants in 
a multi-session study of digital news reading. Björneborn (2010), who observed library users, iden-
tified ten dimensions of library spaces such as diversity, contrast and imperfection that may have 
the potential to enable divergent behavior. Most developments to date have focused on enabling a 
chance encounter, but few have defined a prescription for how to achieve it (André et al., 2009a). 
We examined the techniques that have either been proposed to date, or have been developed 
and or tested in various research projects to identify likely techniques to support the three functions. 
At this point, we do not have any solutions that have been demonstrated as successful in the real 
world. Potential solutions to support the three functions are described below.
1. Enables anomalies and incongruities 
Description: Enabling chance (which may be initially construed as “blind luck” or a happy accident) 
is elemental to serendipity. Chance in this context means something that is uncharacteristic or odd 
compared to the activity currently in focus; something in the current display is perceived as not 
fitting the normal pattern expected at that point in the interaction, and that something has the 
potential to become a trigger. 
Requirement: The display must provide an element that is not what the user expects, and 
thus is seemingly unrelated to what the user is currently doing or focused on. There is a caveat to 
implementing this: a deliberate attempt to engage the user in examining such an element means 
that the system also needs to draw the user’s attention to what at surface value seems irrelevant. 
In the web environment in particular, a user may have “blinker blindness” or functional fixity such 
that visual cues intended to grab attention are ignored. This is not unlike the scientists who seemed 
initially unaware of a solution that when examined in hindsight seemed so obvious (Shapiro, 1986). 
The anomalous element may be an item in a list, a text box, audio signal, or image of some 
sort. The challenge will be in the semantic distance between what the system normally expects to 
display, and the serendipitous trigger, and in how the system “knows” what the element of focus 
is, as well as its attributes. Critical is how the user’s attention is acquired and whether the user is 
receptive to a “seducible moment” (Spool, 2002).
Enabling this aspect has been attempted in a number of ways.
•	 Randomness: Shuffle listening to music (e.g., Leong, Vetere, and Howard, 2006) or 
random viewing of photos (Leong, Harper, and Regan, 2011) when the random selec-
tion is unconstrained with no filters. In case of music or photos, the entire collection 
had the potential to be selected. Liang (2012) argues that the system needs to have 
some form of “unexpectedness generating” that is created by uncertainty as related to 
information, and attention.

41
•	 Unexpected: In weighting items to display in a recommender system for Netflix, Lu 
et al. (2012) assigned higher weights to items in the tail than to those identified as 
the most popular. 
•	 Dissimilarity, i.e., semantically distant: Laquinta et al. (2008) created a recom-
mender that proposes items whose descriptions were semantically distant from the 
user profiles; similarly, Zhang et al.(2012) presented items that were dissimilar to the 
ones previously listened to.
•	 Diversification: Both Adamopoulos and Tuzhilin (2014) and Ziegler et al. (2005) 
maximized the sematic variation in a results/recommendation list. 
•	 Quantity of information presented: de Bruijn and Spence (2001) proposed increas-
ing the amount of information in a display such as scrolling news-bars, headlines, 
stock prices. 
•	 Anomalous Result: Toms (2000b) implemented a tool intended to produce a set of 
articles that were very much like the article that was currently being displayed. The 
weighted Boolean algorithm for making the match often displayed articles that lacked 
any similarity at all which provided anomalous but novel results. The concept was 
reproduced in a second study (Toms and McCay-Peet, 2009) which returned the first 
paragraph of the displayed article as query in wikiSearch, which also provided unusual 
and diverse results. 
2. Identifies the relationships—the connections and bisociations—among different concepts
Description: Enabling a comparison of concepts in which one is clearly well understood by the 
user while the other may not be is a pivotal point on the pathway to serendipity. Furthermore, the 
defining of novel relationships between disparate entities is a core indicator of creativity (Boden, 
1996; Ford, 1999; Koestler, 1964).
Requirement: In the previous function, the role of the system was to focus the attention of 
the user as a starting point. In this function, the intent is to show the relationships among concepts, 
which may fit any of these patterns: 
1.  a concept that is currently being cognitively processed by the user with another con-
cept that is present on, or suggested by, what is present on the display; 
2.  two concepts that are being probed by the user who does not fully understand the 
relationship among them: or, 
4.5 OPERATIONALIZING THOSE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

42
4. FACILITATING SERENDIPITY
3.  two concepts that have unexpectedly emerged on the display due to some prior action 
of the user. 
In the case of (1), the system needs to understand what the user is working on/thinking, 
which may be managed through some form of personalization, or predictive actions based on his-
toric actions, on a direct input from the user. In the case of (2) and (3), it is about presenting why 
those concepts have a relationship. In some cases, the concepts as presented might simply pique 
the user’s curiosity, while in others, the system can assist in aiding the user in that understanding 
(not unlike what one would expect from a good assisted learning system). Note that simple web 
links may, but do not necessarily, enable this opportunity; this is not about precision, recall, accuracy, 
high rating, satisfaction and so on. While an element of, for example, similarity is important, the 
interconnections among the concepts may be for many different reasons including dissimilarity, 
novelty, user, and/or community rating. 
Enabling this aspect has been attempted in a number of ways.
•	 Interdisciplinary cross fertilization at the interface to two disciplines is known to be 
a pertinent site for the proliferation of new ideas (Foster and Ford, 2003).
•	 Indirect associations: Swanson (1986) identified the connection between Raynaud’s 
disease and fish oil by observing that both appeared frequently in article titles that 
included blood viscosity, platelet aggregation and vascular reactivity. This semi-auto-
mated approach has been refined by multiple projects (Swanson and Smalheiser, 1997; 
Lindsay and Gordon 1999; Gordon and Dumais 1998; Weeber et al. 2001; Yetis-
gen-Yildiz, 2006) to represent the underlying structure that represents this algorithm: 
if a is related to b and if c is related to b, then there must be some sort of connection 
between a and c. 
•	 Co-author networks: in creating scholarly paper recommenders, Sugiyama and Kan 
(2015) created co-author networks with an emphasis on the co-authors’ papers rather 
than those of the primary authors.
•	 Collaborative filtering: provision of content based on the action of others such that 
the differences between two people (based on profiles) become the source for novelty 
and anomaly.
•	 Laterality: Campos and de Figuerido (2002) developed elements of lateral thinking 
(de Bono, 1970) in Max, an intelligent agent that navigates the Web on the user’s 
behalf. Max (a) generated alternatives by selecting concepts from random profiles, (b) 
selected both highly relevant and less relevant items using exponential probabilistic 
distribution, and (c) substituted some concepts with related concepts, and thus pres-

43
ents the user with novel suggestions based on these multiple decisions, and a heuristic 
evaluation that also includes the user’s profile. 
•	 Visualization: Saleem et al. (2013) enabled association among large sets of linked 
data so that relationships that are not immediately obvious among concepts may be 
explored. 
3. Identifies potential outcomes given a set of bisociations
Description: Enabling a novel, unexpected outcome is a challenging task. Given that the user’s at-
tention has been engaged, and that the connection has been made, the system now needs to aid the 
user in reaching that game-changing surprising conclusion. What does that odd item, anomaly, or 
incongruous connection actually mean? As Boden (1990a) notes: “a merely novel idea is one which 
can be described and/or produced by the same set of generative rules as are other, familiar ideas. A 
genuinely original, or creative, ideas is one which cannot” (p. 78). 
Requirement: In the previous functions, the user noted the trigger, and identified a relation-
ship among elements even though the user may not yet recognize the full value of that association. 
This third function now aids the user in exploring what this relationship might mean, and how 
it can be used. We know of no one who has induced a serendipitous outcome in digital environ-
ments. We have multiple options for developing cues to serve as triggers, and ways of looking at 
relationships among concepts differently. But arguable, we cannot definitively say that we have put 
all of this together to create a serendipitous digital information environment—yet! Instead, we can 
look to the creative problem solving research for ideas as well as those proposed with respect to 
serendipity. Some of the techniques include the following. 
•	 Reasoning by analogy: compare a problem with something that has little or nothing 
to do with the one at hand (Bawden, 1986; Toms, 2000a; Van Andel, 1994).
•	 Identify the connection that may integrate a set of discrete entities (Bawden, 1986; 
Ford, 1999).
•	 Identify the pattern among a set of concepts (Ford, 1999), which may be semantic, 
structural, linguistic, by color, by size, etc.
•	 Brainstorming to produce a list of possibilities aided by a useful intelligent agent who 
can make pertinent suggestions and additionally evaluate options. 
•	 Reversal: looking at things from the opposite direction.
•	 Exaggeration: consider variable outside the normal range.
•	 Distortion: distort normal relationships between variables; and

4. FACILITATING SERENDIPITY
•	 Wishful thinking: fantasy—imagine if…
4. Integrate with the user application
Description: This was not identified as a function of serendipity, but is integral to enabling ser-
endipity in other applications. To be usable, the serendipity functionality needs to be seamlessly 
integrated within the application’s task-based functionality. 
Requirement: Integrating serendipity in other applications is not analogical to integrating the 
function of cut and paste from application to application. It is not like inserting a dictionary, or an “I 
am lucky” filter or even as has been suggested a “serendipity button” which has appeared in multiple 
locations on the web (the origin of which is unknown). Clearly from all that has been written, the 
openness of a system to maximize the cues available to the user and enhance the user’s ability to 
explore via multiple pathways is the critical component. This also means judiciously enabling the 
requirement of systems to ensure the user is in control—one of Shneiderman’s “eight golden rules” 
(Shneiderman et al., 2016). For example, Toms (1997) provided a slider which enabled the user 
to control how precise the relevance would be, while Benjamin et al. (2014) provided a creativity 
slider that went from “select” the object to “wild.” Implementing the serendipity functionality with 
strong visual cues to engage the attention of the user from simple presentation to views of large 
data/information sets dominates many initiatives (see, for example, Thudt et al., 2012).
While we could not find solid evidence for applications that enabled all functions, there have 
been some promising implementations.
•	 Contact Space (Jeffery and McGrath, 2000) and Serendipity (Eagle and Pentland, 2005) 
are collaborative virtual environments that were intended to support online chance 
encounters.
•	 Bohemian Bookshelf (Thudt et al., 2012) contained five interlinked visualizations of a 
book collections that enabled: multiple visual access points and multiple pathways 
through the collection based on different attributes of books, and showed relationships 
among the books based on those same attributes. The application identified novel vi-
sual representation of the collection enabling interaction with the collection that was 
engaging and playful.
•	 Twitter has emerged in many studies (see, for example, Kop, 2012; Quan-Haase, 
Martin, and McCay-Peet, 2015) as a fertile environment to facilitate serendipity, 
although that was not its intended purpose. More research is needed to deconstruct 
that environment to ascertain what makes it so. Is it, for example, the user control on 
followers, the cross fertilization by the juxtapositioning of hashtags, and retweets, or 
the presentation of diverse content?

SUMMARY
As evident from the attempts to date, facilitating serendipity and nurturing an environment in 
which serendipity may happen is not straightforward. Causing serendipity to occur is an even 
greater, if not impossible, challenge, although the promise of artificial intelligence and its successors 
may have an effective solution. In our systematic examination of the prior research and develop-
ment, we found very few examples of a development that supported all three core functions (i.e., 
enables anomalies, supports connects, support for reaching a surprise outcome) required to enable 
serendipity. Many developments have tested various approaches to enabling a chance encounter 
with a trigger or in displaying connections and potential relationships among concepts and objects. 
While many claims are made about a tool or feature being serendipitous, those claims can 
be challenged (i.e., merely saying it is serendipitous which often means a surprise does not make it 
serendipitous), and have yet to be validated.
The bigger challenge in digital environments is in how to integrate such functionality into 
existing applications, that is, those everyday tools that users use on a regular basis. The existing func-
tionality that enables a user to converge on a solution to a problem, works against the divergence 
that is needed to enable serendipity. Pathways and navigation channels are outside the individual’s 
control, limited by the algorithms that may restrict the display, and as discussed in Chapter 2, may 
create filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011). What we need is what Zetter (2011) calls a “balanced infor-
mation diet,” one that challenges us, provides other points of view, and sometimes simply makes 
us uncomfortable.

CHAPTER  5 
Methods and Measurement
I do not know whether serendipity is a phenomenon that occurs with sufficient frequency, 
whether it is capable of being observed with sufficient accuracy, and whether it is suffi-
ciently controllable to lead to useful research into its nature. At least, it is an inspiring 
phenomenon and a very interesting subject for “pure” research (Bernier, 1960, p. 277).
Given the diversity of the elements contained in serendipity research, serendipity research designs 
deploy a potpourri of research methods from interviews to experiments, which generate a diverse 
set of both qualitative and quantitative data for analyzes. Selecting the best methods to understand 
aspects of serendipity or tools to support serendipity is a challenge; “serendipity is by definition 
not particularly susceptible to systematic control and prediction” (Foster and Ford, 2003, p. 337). 
Bernier’s (1960) reservations about the application of research methods to observe and control 
serendipity continue to ring true almost 60 years later. Serendipity is quite simply very difficult to 
study (e.g., Erdelez, 2004; Kotkov et al., 2016; McBirnie, 2008; Rahman and Wilson, 2015). 
As discussed in Chapter 2, the impetus to understand the phenomena now extends beyond 
pure research into development for real world application. Thus, research designs are much more 
diverse and extensive than those used in researching typical social science phenomena. Through a 
diversity of method, research motivation, topic, context and measurement this chapter provides an 
overview of some of the current serendipity research methods.
5.1	
RESEARCH DESIGN
As with any research project, the research design depends on the purpose of the research, which in 
turn determines the selection of data collecting methods, techniques for analysis, and the measures 
to use. In serendipity research, the designs have tended to be:
•	 descriptive studies (e.g., Makri and Blandford, 2012; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015);
•	 correlational studies to examine the relationships among variables (e.g., Heinström, 
2006; McCay-Peet, Kelloway, and Toms, 2015); or
•	 experimental (e.g., Taramigkou, Apostolou, and Mentza, 2017; Thudt, Hinrichs, and 
Carpendale, 2012; Toms, 2000b). 

48
5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
Within these various designs, one or more methods have been deployed. Based on prior 
research to date (as described in the previous chapters), we have grouped broadly the purposes that 
have emerged from our systematic review of serendipity research with the methods and analyzes 
that have been used to date (see Table 5.1). We refer the reader to the many textbooks about re-
search design, methods and data analysis for a generic explanation of how and when to use them. 
In this chapter, we describe how some of the methods have been deployed in serendipity research. 
Evident from these summary descriptions is the number of multiple methods, or mixed methods 
research studies. Some methods such as observation have primarily been used in the physical envi-
ronment (see, for example, Björneborn, 2008) and are not examined here. At the end of this chapter 
we address the measurement problem in the very quantitative sense of that word.

INTERVIEWS
Background 
Interviews are organized, purposeful conversations between researchers and participants that may 
take place face-to-face or via email, telephone, or over the internet using a software application and 
may be structured (similar to survey questionnaires), semi-structured, or unstructured. There are 
three core elements of an interview as a method for collecting data: 
1.  they take place between two people; 
2.  the researcher and participant have different roles in the conversation; and 
3.  there is a clear purpose to the interview (Luo and Wildemuth, 2009). 
Interviews result in piles of textual data, and thus measurement in this context like any qual-
itative data set does not fit the norm of what is typically considered “measurement.” This is very 
much about understanding, which is achieved through various types of qualitative analyzes such as 
thematic analysis, and content analysis.
Use in Serendipity Research
Interviews are invaluable for answering the how and why questions related to serendipity. Thus, the 
primary reasons interviews are employed in serendipity research are to achieve four purposes from 
Table 5.1, namely: 
1.  understand the phenomena,
2.  understand human perception of the phenomena,
3.  understand human individual differences with respect to the phenomena, and
  9.  assess an outcome as serendipitous.
While sometimes used as the sole method of data collection in serendipity studies (Bar-
ber and Fox, 1958; McBirnie, 2008; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015), interviews are often used in 
conjunction with other methods such as diaries (Leong et al., 2010), naturalistic observation and 
think-aloud protocols (Björneborn, 2008), and experiments that involve the collection of log data 
and relevance judgments (André et al., 2009b).
Although not always explicitly described as such in research reports, semi-structured inter-
views appear to be the most extensively used interview approach in serendipity research (e.g., Bel-
lotti et al., 2008; Martin and Quan-Haase, 2016; McBirnie, 2008; McCay-Peet and Toms, 2015). 
Serendipity is a complex phenomenon and semi-structured interviews allow researchers to examine 
specific aspects of serendipity of interest but also give researchers the flexibility to explore related 
5.2 INTERVIEWS

5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
and perhaps unexpected aspects that emerge during interviews. As part of a series of studies, Bel-
lotti et al. (2008) used the semi-structured interview approach with 32 participants to understand 
leisure and information behavior relating to leisure and to help evaluate the concept of a tool 
that supports serendipity, a mobile leisure guide. McBirnie (2008) used semi-structured interview 
techniques to interview two jazz improvisers and eight academics to understand serendipity and 
the conditions that may facilitate it. In this section, we focus on one study (Martin and Quan-
Haase, 2016), which employed semi-structured interviews in which the motivation for research 
was one of the previously identified main drivers of serendipity research (Chapter 2): physical vs. 
digital environments.
Example 
Martin and Quan-Haase (2016) applied the semi-structured interview approach to gain an under-
standing of serendipity in the historical research process and further found the method useful for 
identifying how serendipity may be supported through digital and physical environments, and, like 
McBirnie (2008), through training. 
Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 historians, using grounded theory 
methods, Martin and Quan-Haase (2016) investigated “the changing research practices of histori-
ans,” contrasting “their experiences of serendipity in physical and digital environments” (p. 1008). 
To start, ten participants were interviewed and data analyzed before modifications to interview 
questions were made and ten more participants were interviewed using the constant comparative 
method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Interviews were selected over diary studies and observation in 
order to gain more detailed accounts and allow the authors to ask probing questions (Martin and 
Quan-Haase, 2016). However, the authors also note that their selected method made it difficult 
to recruit participants because of the need for the interviews to take place in-person. Despite the 
challenge, the method allowed them to identify themes that serve to increase our understanding of 
serendipity and highlight the ways in which the movement from physical to digital environments 
has affected historians. They found that historians perceived themselves as active agents in their 
experience of serendipity, doing things like browsing created opportunities for serendipity. Another 
key finding included the identification of the need to help historians make connections between 
physical and digital resources by better integrating these types of resources; to this end, primary 
source context and organizational context (e.g., library stacks) should be supported through digital 
tools. What was evident from this paper was that semi-structured interviews helped provide a 
deeper understanding of how historians viewed the shift from physical to digital and how seren-
dipity, and the historical research process in general, could be supported through thoughtful design 
of digital environments. 

51
5.3	
DIARIES
Background
Diaries are another way that researchers can capture and observe the thoughts and behaviors of 
participants. Rather than a computer system or the researcher capturing participant data, however, 
in the case of research diaries, it is the participant who actively captures their own data by record-
ing their experiences, thoughts, and feelings over time. The diaries are solicited by the researcher 
and they are essentially self-report logs that may be written records or include images and other 
objects that contextualize the participants’ experiences. Like interviews, diaries may be unstruc-
tured, structured or semi-structured, each providing different levels of guidance to the participant 
on what should be recorded in the diary and when. Diaries may be comprised of pen and paper, 
but more commonly researchers are using other methods such as web-based diaries (Shelbe and 
Wildemuth, 2009).
Diaries may result in both open-ended textual responses and items that can be quantified 
in some way. Like interviews and focus groups, this is very much about understanding, which is 
achieved through various types of qualitative analyzes such as thematic analysis and content analy-
sis. But structured diaries also create categorical data or data that may classified in some way such 
that the items can be coded and thus counted in some way to show frequencies or magnitude of a 
set of elements, events or processes, and or the relationships and correlations among them.
Use in Serendipity Research
Diaries, like interviews and focus groups, are employed in serendipity research to achieve four pur-
poses from Table 5.1, namely:
1. understand the phenomena,
2. understand human perception of the phenomena,
3. understand human individual differences with respect to the phenomena, and
9. assess an outcome as serendipitous.
The diary method has been used many times in serendipity research (e.g., Bentley, Basapur 
and Chowdhury, 2011; Leong et al., 2010; Rahman and Wilson, 2015; Sun et al., 2011; William-
son, 1998). Williamson (1998) asked participants to keep telephone diaries indicating the intent 
of their phone call and what was discussed in order to understand the information behaviors of 
older adults. Through this method and combined with interviews, Williams found that participants 
encountered information when they were not explicitly looking for it, often through interactions 
with other people. While Sawaizumi et al. (2009) used diaries as a method of data collection, they 
were also interested in diaries as a means to support serendipity. Participants were given “serendipity 
5.3 DIARIES

52
5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
cards,” paper-based cards, to fill in over a period of a few months. The cards prompted participants 
to fill in information on observations that they made as well as their hypothesis, the who, what, 
when, where, why, and how, and the result. The intent was to nurture observations in the incubation 
period of serendipity and encourage deeper thinking that could potentially lead to a serendipitous 
outcome. No incidences of serendipity, however, were captured in Sawaizumi et al.’s study, high-
lighting the difficulty of capturing a phenomenon that for many is infrequent and intermittent. As 
these examples (Sawaizumi et al., 2009; Williamson, 1998) illustrate, the rationale for conducting 
diary studies is similar to that of using interview methods: to gain a greater understanding of the 
phenomenon, how it may be facilitated, and how well a tool supports serendipity within a particular 
context. The remainder of this section focuses on research by Leong et al. (2010) that used the diary 
method to understand serendipity as user experience in the context of music listening.
Example
Through interpretivist qualitative research, Leong et al. (2010) examined people’s experiences of 
serendipity while listening to music. To do this, they argued it was necessary to capture this in the 
field, in the natural setting of people’s lives where serendipity happens. A diary was given to each 
participant in which they were instructed to record their listening experiences for seven weeks. 
Because participants were asked to record their experiences in any way they chose in the diary, the 
quality of expression was uneven, ranging from “perfunctory” to “vivid” (p. 258). And while Leong 
et al. (2010) note the many insights gained through an analysis of the diaries, they also note their 
fragmentary nature and the need to conduct open-ended interviews “to ‘thicken’ these descriptions, 
and get closer to the whole person and the weight of the experience as lived and felt” (p. 260). The 
diaries, however, were further used in face-to-face interviews to help explore the stories recorded, 
to help fill in some of the blanks, and create shared understanding. So while participants recorded 
serendipitous experiences in their diaries, these experiences were explored further to help under-
stand further details surrounding the experience. Leong et al. (2010) found “that at the heart of 
the experience of serendipity was the emergence of powerful personal meanings out of seemingly 
random coincidence of events” (p. 263). In relation to methods, they conclude: 
The methods we used and the kind of insights into serendipity they offered, do not allow us 
to measure or compare the intensity of serendipitous experiences, nor do they allow us on 
the basis of such comparison to argue that one form of digital shuffle might be more effective 
than another. What our account offers instead is an understanding of how to shape the pro-
cesses that need to come together in order for a serendipitous experience to emerge (p. 263).
While the diary study method used by Leong et al. (2010) may not be the go-to method 
for comparing, for example, how well one digital musical listening tool supports serendipity over 
another, this method does inform what conditions need to be in place for serendipity to happen.

EXISTING DOCUMENTS
Background
Existing documents may include almost any form of textual artifact. These sources tend to have 
been written without any intention of examining serendipity as the purpose for their creation. They 
may be published or unpublished, take a formal or informal form, and may be physical or digital. 
Official documents, memos, and diaries are all potential sources for data. This source of data is 
unobtrusive at least with respect to the current study, as their collection by the researcher had no 
impact on the original participants; the documents are natural in the sense that they were not cre-
ated within the confines of the research study (Wildemuth, 2009b). 
Use in Serendipity Research
Because existing documents are records of the past, they achieve three purposes from Table 5.1, 
namely to:
1. understand the phenomena,
4. understand what facilitates the phenomena, and
9. assess an outcome as serendipitous.
Using existing documents is to date an uncommon source in serendipity research, although 
the few studies have isolated many incidences of serendipity that have not necessarily been described 
as such by its authors. Campanario (1996) first used this method to understand the phenomenon 
of serendipity in science. He analyzed 205 Citation Classics Database, commentaries by the au-
thors of 400 of the most highly cited scientific papers together with the original papers to uncover 
whether and how serendipity may have played a role in the discoveries. These commentaries were 
classified using Van Andel’s (1994) 17 proposed serendipity patterns or “ways in which unsought 
findings have been made” (Van Andel’s, 1994, p. 640). More recently, Erdelez and Beheshti (see 
Erdelez et al., 2016), used informetric analysis to examine serendipity research output in multiple 
disciplines and found that different disciplines have developed different terminology relating to 
serendipity and that serendipity research often exists in silos with few connections between seren-
dipity researchers across different fields. This method, therefore, appears to be an interesting way 
to understand the growing field of serendipity research itself and see differences in approaches and 
gaps in connections among pockets of research in the area.
Using existing documents, thus, results in quantities of qualitative data from the contents of 
those documents, which may be analyzed using thematic and content analyzes. But additionally the 
metadata from those documents may be used to describe the elements and their relationships and 
thus used to describe serendipity research output. The example described below (Rubin, Burkell, 
5.4 EXISTING DOCUMENTS

54
5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
and Quan-Haase, 2011) provides an illustration of the use of the existing documents in serendipity 
research.
Example
Through a systematic search of GoogleBlog, Rubin et al. (2011) conducted an analysis of 56 blog 
posts that described “naturally occurring accounts of chance encounters” (n.p.). Grounded theory 
was used to analyze the data. While Rubin et al. did not restrict where these chance encounters 
took place—physical or digital—they found that 24 took place in a digital information environ-
ment. Through the analysis they identified four main facets relating to the find—prepared mind, 
act of noticing, chance, and fortuitous outcome (see also Table 3.1), which both helps to explain 
the phenomenon in the context of everyday life and points to how it may be facilitated by digital 
information environments. Rubin et al. note, for example, that particular attention should be paid 
to creating digital information environments that enhance the facets of noticing and the prepared 
mind. While the advantage of the existing document approach is that the accounts are realistic and 
self-generated rather than obtained through artificial means, a drawback is that “these texts do not 
address all of the nuances of a chance encounter episode” (Rubin et al., 2011, n.p.). A large sample 
of accounts, however, may lessen such concerns.

VERBAL PROTOCOLS 
Background
Verbal protocols are used to collect information on the cognitive processes of participants by en-
couraging the vocalized explanation of actions, either during (think aloud), or immediately after 
(talk after), interacting with a system. Think-aloud protocols may be performed concurrently during 
a task or retrospectively. While the concurrent think-aloud happens in real-time, retrospective 
think-aloud protocols allow the participant to complete their tasks naturally before being asked to 
relive and describe their thoughts. Verbal protocols are usually used together with screen capture 
that records in a video the actions of the user and response of the system. In think-aloud protocols, 
the video and/or audio record simultaneously and overlay the screen capture. In the case of talk after 
(i.e., retrospective protocols), the recording replayed after the session is finished to prompt partici-
pants for explanations of actions and thoughts during their task. There are limitations to both types: 
talk aloud requires participants to multi-task, that is, to explain what they are doing currently while 
solving another problem or doing another task which may slow and interfere with task performance 
and impact data collected; talk after may lead participants to blend other memories leading to mis-
leading data (Oh and Wildemuth, 2009; Van den Haak et al., 2004). 
The data from verbal protocols form streams of consciousness whose value is in the context 
in which the actions occurred. Toms (1997) mapped the comments made in talk-after session to 

55
logfiles (see Section 5.7), which enabled coding and content analysis of the comments according 
to point in the process, and further examination of the process in a quantitative way. The value to 
serendipity research was in identifying the surprise find-the trigger, the participant’s explanation 
of the connection, and the value of that connection to the participant.
Use in Serendipity Research
Verbal protocols are actively used in research in the digital information environment as they enable 
greater understanding of user actions and thus tend to be used for the following purposes in seren-
dipity research as identified in Table 5.1:
4. understand what facilitates the phenomena,
5. deconstruct the phenomena to extract its core processes and influential elements,
6. develop and test cues to trigger the phenomena,
7. develop and test techniques to facilitate connections and relationships that have the 
potential to enable the phenomena, and
8. develop and test techniques to facilitate a serendipitous interpretation of the con-
nections, i.e., get to the valuable outcome.
Verbal protocols, as previously noted in this chapter, have been used in serendipity research 
in combination with screen capture and logfile analysis to provide a rich data set in which the user 
actions and behaviors are objectively recorded and supplemented by cognitive thought processes 
for an understanding of the reasons behind those behaviors. Björneborn (2008), Yadamsuren and 
Erdelez (2010), and Toms (1997) used verbal protocols in order to link participants’ thoughts di-
rectly to the observed information encountering and divergent behaviors. While verbal protocols 
are useful for evaluating the effectiveness of a system to support chance encounters (Toms, 1997), 
they are also useful for gaining an understanding of how people experience information encounters 
(Björneborn, 2008). 
Example
To “understand whether and how a particular digital information environment creates opportuni-
ties for serendipity” (p. 9) Makri et al. (2015) used think aloud with screen capture to collect the ac-
tions and behaviors of 45 participants interacting with different types of information environments 
in a controlled setting. Solomon and Bronstein (2016) note the difficulty in directly observing 
serendipity and thus the verbal protocols + screen capture provide a good compromise. 
Makri et al. took a naturalistic approach by asking participants to perform information tasks 
of their own choosing which led to a variety of tasks including, for example, browsing news sites 
and looking for a specific product to purchase. Participants—computer science students—were 
5.5 VERBAL PROTOCOLS

5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
divided into three groups with participants in each group asked to use one of three types of digital 
information environment: news sites, digital libraries, and e-commerce sites. Participants were not 
aware that the focus of the study was serendipity and a post-task questionnaire revealed that most 
were not familiar with the phenomenon. Participants were asked to think-aloud during the tasks, 
allowing the researchers to capture participants’ verbalization of what they were doing and why. A 
recording was made of the screen as well as an audio recording. A follow-up interview was con-
ducted to probe instances that were noted as both useful and unexpected and understand. Using 
inductive and deductive analysis, both observational and interview data was coded. While Makri 
et al. note that due to the unexpectedness of serendipity it is “difficult to observe in controlled re-
search environment” (p. 10), with careful research design it is possible and such an approach enables 
researchers to evaluate how well digital environments support serendipity. Through the study, they 
found instances in which participants found “useful information unexpectedly when not looking for 
anything in particular and finding useful information unexpectedly when looking for information 
on something else” (p. 5). Makri et al. argue that the direct observation approach allows for a better 
understanding of the types of interactions that support serendipity, which is imperative to under-
standing the requirements of serendipitous digital information environments.
5.6	
QUESTIONAIRES
Background
Questionnaires allow researchers to collect a range of data relating to participant perceptions, 
attributes, opinions and behaviors through closed and open-ended questions and scalar responses 
to statements (Hank, Jordan, and Wildemuth, 2009). Questionnaires generate a lot of quantitative 
data. The analyzes depending on the design can be as straightforward as counts, frequencies, and 
percentages, and thus very descriptive of the phenomena, to comparative, correlational, and even 
experimental analyzes that test differences among the variables.
Use in Serendipity Research
Questionnaires are invaluable for answering the how and why questions related to serendipity. Thus, 
the primary reasons interviews are employed in serendipity research are to achieve four purposes 
from Table 5.1, namely:
 1. understand the phenomena,
2. understand human perception of the phenomena,
3. understand human individual differences with respect to the phenomena, and
9. assess an outcome as serendipitous.

57
Questionnaires have been used extensively in serendipity research (e.g., Guy et al., 2015; 
Hornung et al., 2013; McCay-Peet, Toms, and Kelloway, 2015; Million et al., 2013) for multiple 
purposes. Some research projects (e.g., Yadamsuren and Erdelez, 2010; 2016) have used question-
naires as a screening technique to select participants who appear to have more of a propensity of 
information encountering for participation in further research. This technique allows for richer 
interview data to be collected as it ensures interviewed participants will have something to say 
about an aspect of serendipity or related concepts like information encountering. In order to better 
understand the psychological aspects of incidental information acquisition (IIA), Heinström (2006) 
used a series of established scales for measuring personality and approaches to studying as well as 
statements relating feelings, information seeking styles, and propensity for IAA on Likert scales. 
Questionnaires have also been used post-experiment as a way to gather information regarding 
serendipitous experiences with systems (e.g., Taramigkou et al., 2017; Toms, 1997; Toms and Mc-
Cay-Peet, 2009). Relative to the qualities of recommendations and search results, questionnaires 
have been used to collect data on users’ perceptions of content or information including, for exam-
ple, how unknown yet valuable (Campos and Figueiredo, 2002), not relevant but interesting (André 
et al., 2009b), interesting (Toms, 1997), or interesting but previously unknown (Murakami, Mori, 
and Orihara, 2008).
Example
Solomon and Bronstein (2016) used a web-based, closed-ended questionnaire, to understand the 
role of serendipity in legal information seeking. While their motivation for research was grounded 
in understanding the phenomenon of serendipity, their study design, which includes questions 
relating to the use of electronic, printed, and human information sources, also informs research 
relating to physical vs. digital research and strategies for information behaviors in the context of 
legal information seeking. Participants included 135 Israeli family law advocates, a 22.5% response 
rate. The survey included Likert scale and multiple choice questions relating, for example, to the 
frequency in which participants experience unexpected and valuable encounters (based on Bogers 
and Björneborn, 2013), participants’ “background problems” (Erdelez, 2004, 2005), and the value 
of the encounters. Solomon and Bronstein (2016) found that family law advocates were “super-en-
counters” (Erdelez, 1999) who perceived electronic information sources (e.g., electronic databases, 
the web) to be the most serendipitous sources. While Solomon and Bronstein (2016) note ques-
tionnaires’ dependence on participants to recall their information encountering experiences as a 
potential drawback, they argue it would be difficult to observe the phenomenon of serendipity; this 
is particularly true given the time constraints of this study population, family law advocates.

LOGFILE ANALYSIS
Background
In serendipity research relating to digital environments, computer logs are often combined with 
other methods including pre- and post-task or post-session questionnaires (e.g., Benjamin et al., 
2014), interviews (e.g., Åman et al., 2014), and verbal protocols (e.g., Toms, 1997). A computer log 
(or transaction log) records all time-stamped actions that users make and all responses from the 
system, as well as selected metadata.
Use in Serendipity Research
Logfiles are actively used in the digital use environment as they identify user actions (e.g., key-
strokes and mouse clicks) and systems responses and thus tend to be used for the following pur-
poses identified in Table 5.1:
6. develop and test cues to trigger the phenomena,
7. develop and test techniques to facilitate connections and relationships that have the 
potential to enable the phenomena, and
8. develop and test techniques to facilitate a serendipitous interpretation of the con-
nections, i.e., get to the valuable outcome.
Logfile analysis has been used in serendipity research in a number of ways, both inside and 
outside a lab. André et al. (2009b), for example, collected client-side web search logs over a period 
of one month from 36 participants together with interviews and questionnaires. The logs led the 
researchers to compare participants’ explicit serendipity judgments (defined as interesting but not 
relevant results) with actual interactions with their desktop including interactions with desktop 
content. They found that “rather than harming serendipity, personalization appears to identify 
interesting results in addition to relevant ones” (p. 2033). In contrast, Taramigkou, Apostolou, and 
Mentza’s (2017), the research took place within a lab setting. We examine this latter research in 
more detail to understand the value of the method they selected.
The motivations behind Taramigkou et al.’s (2017) research were two of the six main moti-
vations of serendipity research identified in Chapter 2: information overload and user experience. 
They argue: 
Despite the vast amount of potentially inspiring information available on the Web 
and the social Web and the emergence of specialized inspiration engines, it is not easy 
for users to discover inspirational information among the results list of engines that 
follow the conventional search paradigm in which users type in their queries and 

59
the engine presents a list of results leaving it to the user to go through each result 
and possibly discover an inspiration resource by reading the results previews (p. 94).
While there is a lot of information available on the web and through social media platforms, 
discovering that information is generally accomplished following the direct search paradigm; alter-
native search paradigms are needed to support serendipity. 
Example
Taramigkou et al. (2017) conducted two task-based experiments in a lab and a pilot study to eval-
uate how well their experimental system, CReative User centric Inspirational SEarch (CRUISE), 
supported “serendipitous encounters” (p. 107). Only the first study in which log data was analyzed 
is explored here.
In the first task-based user study reported by Taramigkou et al. (2017), using a between-sub-
jects design, participants used an experimental system, CRUISE, or the baseline system. Interactions 
with these systems were logged for analysis. The baseline system was a standard query-based retrieval 
system through which users could type queries and view results (documents, images, videos) in a list. 
In contrast, CRUISE was designed to support serendipity, recommending diverse sources through 
visual cues and allowing users to interactively explore information drawn from the web as well as a 
microblogging site (Twitter). Twenty Ph.D. students were asked to complete a task to create an out-
line for a research proposal and complete a post-study questionnaire designed to assess the systems 
based on, for example, the quality of the content. Participants were randomly assigned to either the 
focus or control group and asked to evaluate their respective systems on their support for inspiration 
and serendipity (usefulness and unexpectedness of results). Two professors assessed the originality 
and quality of the theses outlines. Taramigkou et al. (2017) hypothesized that those participants 
“who had serendipitous discoveries would be inspired and hence able to formulate creative ideas” (p. 
107). The data logged during the user studies allowed Taramigkou et al. (2017) to compare partic-
ipant interactions with the experimental and baseline system and find that participants performed 
significantly more queries when using the experimental system and that the experimental system was 
more serendipitous than the baseline system, measured using the log data collected and a metric for 
assessing serendipity in recommendation systems adapted from Ge et al. (2010).
The two professors’ assessments also suggested use of the experimental system led to better 
outcomes both in terms of quality and originality. Like Martin and Quan-Haase (2016), Tara-
migkou et al. (2017) noted that participant recruitment was a challenge and the limited number of 
participants led to changes in their methodology. Taramigkou et al. (2017) also noted privacy con-
cerns that some participants expressed in the use of individual Twitter accounts, through which the 
recommendation service was based. But, overall, it appears, that observation through log analysis, 
together with other methods, provided a detailed record of user interactions. Log analysis provided

an unobtrusive method of observing interactions rather than solely relying on participants’ memory 
of these interactions, helping to confirm findings from professor assessments and the questionnaire.
5.8	
MEASURING SERENDIPITY?
We are confident in saying that we cannot yet measure serendipity and we are still a long way from 
being able to predict its occurrence. Serendipity can be a lengthy process from that first observation 
of a cue that sets off a trigger, to that valuable outcome. Thus, any notion of outcomes and their 
success may be a long time in the making, which is often not very conducive to research, and con-
strains application developments in the digital information environment. 
To examine the measurement issue in the digital information environment, we focus on the 
set of elements from Chapter 4 that can be quantified. Our approach to this matter follows a pos-
itivist paradigm, and does ignore the initial purposes that relate to understanding the phenomena, 
which is populated primarily by qualitative research. It is not intended to assess, for example, the 
context or the individual differences of users, which have been well documented within their re-
spective disciplines and for which serendipity is just another problem area. Instead, we have focused 
on measuring items essential to, and clearly defined within, a study of serendipity. This includes a 
look at assessing the environment as a whole, the cue that drives the trigger and subsequently the 
connections, which hopefully will lead to that valuable outcome. 
•	 Holistic assessment of the digital information environment, that is, does it have the 
potential capability of facilitating serendipity?
McCay-Peet and colleagues (McCay-Peet, Toms and Kelloway, 2014; McCay-Peet 
and Toms, 2015; McCay-Peet, Toms and Kelloway, 2015) identified the characteristics 
of digital information environments conducive to serendipity and created a 15-item 
scale, the Serendipitous Digital Environment Scale (see Appendix A) that includes four 
dimensions or factors (Leads to the Unexpected, Highlights Triggers, Trigger-Rich, 
and Enables Connections). The four dimensions primarily capture the trigger/con-
nection stage and unexpected element identified across multiple models of serendipity 
in Table 3.1. When used in conjunction with a 4-item Perception of Serendipity Scale 
(McCay-Peet, Toms and Kelloway, 2015), an assessment of how frequently a user per-
ceives serendipity occurs in a digital information environment may be obtained, thus 
capturing serendipity in a more holistic manner. The Perception of Serendipity Scale (see 
Appendix B) includes items that are essentially definitions of serendipity; two items 
use the word “serendipity” while two describe the phenomenon, mirroring definitions 
developed by Erdelez (2005) and Makri and Blandford (2012). Both the Serendipitous 
Digital Environment and Perception of Serendipity scales are measured on a 5-point 

61
scale of agreement (strongly agree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly 
agree). However, more work still needs to be done to validate the scales. 
•	 Enable the “anomaly” or the chance encounter to trigger an event. 
Enabling a chance encounter has two characteristics: 
ºº the ability of the cue to attract the user’s attention, and
ºº the ability of the cue to engage the user with its content.
To date, this has been measured by a number of measures such as Unexpectedness 
(Adamopolos and Tuzhilin, 2014), Originality (Koh et al., 2007), Interestingness 
(André et al., 2009a), and Novelty (Toms, 2000b). Not all measures are fully described 
in their papers making it difficult to extract operational measures. Some are objective 
measures, and some assess user perception. Toms (2000b), for example, measured 
Novelty as the percentage of articles read on topics previously unknown to partici-
pants, while Interestingness was rated using a user perception scale.
The Serendipitious Digital Environment Scale (discussed above) has three dimensions 
that deal specifically with the triggers and their value: Trigger-Rich, Highlights Trig-
gers, and Leads to the Unexpected (McCay-Peet, Toms, and Kelloway, 2015). 
•	 Support the user in “connecting the dots,” that is, identifying the relationship be-
tween the cue and what is percolating inside the user’s head, or showing relationships 
between the cue and other incongruent elements. 
Enabling this function requires the development of a tool to assess the user in recog-
nizing that relationship. We can evaluate the tool’s ability to identify connections as 
well as the user’s perception of the usefulness of the tool’s output. The Serendipitous 
Digital Environment Scale discussed above has one dimension that deals specifically 
with the user’s perception of whether the environment enables connections, but this 
examines the environment holistically and not the output of a single tool.
•	 Support the user in reaching a significant surprise outcome. 
Similarly, this too requires tools that aid the user in making sense of the connection. 
To our knowledge no tool yet achieves this, and thus we have no measures, but we 
surmise that this will be somewhat similar to the previous one.
5.8 MEASURING SERENDIPITY?

62
5. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT
•	 The valuable outcome.
In most qualitative research, the presence or lack of, a valuable outcome is often a 
question asked of participants. Indeed, a positive response is a measurable indicator 
that serendipity has occurred (pending the presence of the other conditions, as simply 
being a surprise is not sufficient). A successful valuable and unexpected outcome may 
be the ultimate measure.
Because the bulk of the research on serendipity to date has focused on understanding the 
phenomena, we do not have specific measures that have been operationalized and tested for reliabil-
ity and validity. But that research provides some hints. Makri and Blandford (2012), for example, 
identified insightful and valuable, but did not prescribe how each could be measured.
5.9	
SUMMARY
Evident from a review of the methods used in serendipity research is that each technique has the 
ability, to varying degrees, to inform our understanding of the phenomenon, what may facilitate it, 
and help evaluate how well an environment facilitates it. While some of the methods discussed in 
this chapter seem better able to help us gain an understanding of serendipity such as interviews, 
other methods such as analysis of log data appear to be more useful for the evaluation of systems 
designed to support serendipity. However, what is evident from the research examined in this chap-
ter is that there is flexibility in the use of methods and a great deal of room for creativity in the 
development of approaches to serendipity research. A lessened reliance on memory is particularly 
important in serendipity research as participants may have difficulty recalling the details surround-
ing their information encounters (Erdelez and Rioux, 2000b). Using a mixed methods approach 
appears to be the most fruitful tactic to take in the study of serendipity, no matter the motivation 
for the research or its context. Serendipity is difficult to facilitate and capture, however, “if you want 
to understand serendipity there is value in coming at serendipity from many different directions” 
(André et al., 2009a, p. 307).

CHAPTER  6
Conclusion and Framework
This book has examined serendipity through a digital information environment lens. It comes at 
a critical juncture in the development of this relatively nascent research area. Although research 
papers on serendipity in digital information environments have been bubbling up in conference 
proceedings and journals across a variety of disciplines for decades now, they are on the increase 
and patterns are developing in the way the research is approached. We identified several of these 
patterns including the drivers of serendipity research and how serendipity is approached in the re-
search, facilitated, and measured. These patterns provide frameworks for future research and reveal 
scarcity in some areas pointing to areas in which more work is needed.
Drivers. The rationale for conducting serendipity research is expanding as society reckons 
with technological developments in digital information environments and their implications. We 
are still grappling with the shift from physical to digital, although this may change in the coming 
decades. Information overload and filter bubbles are problems that are likely to continue to dog users 
in the coming years and more research will be needed to ensure good user experience and develop 
user strategies for increasing the potential for serendipity. Moreover, more research is needed to 
understand the phenomenon itself, with all its moving parts and its shifting conceptual meaning as 
a part of living language. More work is also needed to understand the consequences, both good and 
bad, of trying to turn up the volume on serendipity. What are the privacy and ethical implications, 
for example, of this form of manipulation through personalization, however good its intentions?
Approaches to serendipity. It is clear there are numerous ways in which serendipity has 
been approached in research, as both a quality (an event, something, someone) and a process. These 
different approaches can largely be explained from a research area or discipline perspective. For 
example, it is no surprise that recommender systems research approaches serendipity as a quality of 
the something (i.e., the recommendation). While much has been learned through this focus on a 
specific aspect of support for serendipity, working in interdisciplinary teams with researchers from 
psychology, information science, and human-computer interaction, for example, may suggest new 
ways of approaching serendipity, thus building theory.
Facilitating serendipity. Once one moves from the physical setting to one that is an almost 
exclusively digital information environment, the way in which serendipity can be nurtured and fa-
cilitated opens up almost untold (and not yet developed) options. Notably, the digital environment 
(at present) constrains the process (e.g., viewing options through a multitude of devices with varied 
sizes of “windows”—the tip of the iceberg phenomena) and at the same time, greatly enhances and 
augments human capability (along the lines of Licklider’s (1960) and Bush’s (1945) early predic-

64
6. CONCLUSION AND FRAMEWORK
tions) for increased serendipitous encounters and outcomes—as long as the technology does not 
continue down the filter bubble pathway. With computing capability that has changed since even 
the writing of this paragraph, we have so much potential for facilitating not just a functional ap-
proach to information tasks and knowledge work, but to creating effective nurturing environments 
that let serendipity happen. Achieving an integrated interface that enables task functionality and at 
the same time enables serendipity is the “holy grail” of serendipity R&D goals. While we work to-
ward that functionality, the key building blocks are currently in their R&D naissance. Many things 
have been tested, but we do not yet have a definitive set. We still need tools that: 
1.  enable anomalies and incongruities; 
2.  identify the relationships—the connections and bisociations—among different con-
cepts;
3.  identify potential outcomes given a set of connections and bisociations; and
4.  integrate the three with the user application.
Please note that we are not advocating systems that simply do the task; instead we promote 
the role of taking advantage of human vagaries, knowledge and experiences that may still inspire 
solutions that machines do not know about, and that inform and support quality of life. 
Methods and measurement. So many methods have been used to understand serendipity as 
phenomena, mostly the traditional ones that have stood the test of time in many disciplines. In the 
digital information environments and in particular with respect to serendipity, we are constrained 
by the human participant and that participant’s life history. While the interconnected Web weaves 
a rich “back channel” of data and information about a person, it still does not know the human 
experience from one human interaction with a technology to another, and nor does it know the 
thoughts and perceptions that percolate at the same time. While technology evolves to facilitate 
human interactions in digital information environments, the tools we use for data collection also 
continue to advance. However, we need more sophisticated biometric data collection tools that can 
measure and predict human response, and identify the human response to stimuli. We are almost 
at the point of being able to monitor and analyze human interactions in a large scale (as the big 
data phenomenon has presented), which may enable longitudinal collection of human responses, 
such that we can identify when a human responds to a trigger, and when that valuable outcome 
has been achieved.
 Conceptualization and operationalization. The cornerstone of good research is an ability 
to precisely describe the phenomenon that will be “placed under the microscope,” and then to be 
able to describe, measure, predict and explain something about that phenomenon. The naysayers 
may complain about the need for fuzziness in dealing with intangible concepts; they are indeed 
correct, at least for now. Until we understand fully understand the phenomenon (as well as clearly 

65
conceptually and operationally define it, which we have done in this volume) there will be fuzzi-
ness. When we introduce policies into organizations, or invest in new applications, or recommend 
to people about the value of using an application or adopting a type of behavior to advocate and 
invest in serendipity, then we need to be precise, as there is much at stake. We have a lot of research 
outcomes in which the serendipitous claim is being made. This is especially so and well articulated 
in science and engineering. In the social sciences, we have diluted the concept (and particular in the 
digital information environment) such that anything that is a surprise or unexpected is perceived to 
be serendipitous. But is that unexpected item in a results list, for example, serendipitous? We need 
to fully define the scope if we are to do comparative research and meta analyzes that develop a solid 
foundation on which to build.

Author Biographies
Lori McCay-Peet works in government in the area of corporate information management and 
is an Adjunct Professor in the School of Information Management at Dalhousie University in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her research focuses on people’s perceptions and uses of digital 
information environments, particularly in the context of knowledge work. Her Ph.D. research, 
funded by a SSHRC Joseph-Armand Bombardier Doctoral Scholarship, investigated the facets of 
a digital environment that may facilitate serendipity. She has published and presented her research 
in several information science and computer science publications and venues including the Journal 
of the Association of Information Science and Technology, Information Research, Information Processing 
and Management, and the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
Elaine Toms is Professor of Information Innovation & Management in the Management 
School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK. Prior to this she held posts at the University of To-
ronto and Dalhousie University (including a Canada Research Chair) in Canada. She researches 
information interaction in complex information use environments, focusing on the human use of 
technology to support human tasks and how to evaluate the technology and the processes. Ser-
endipity has been a lifelong research interest from the Ph.D. research when her research design 
“caused” serendipity to occur, to the present which is now immersed in how we might nurture 
serendipity in our digital spaces. Along the way her work was supported by a number of research 
agencies including in particular the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, 
the Canada Research Chairs Program, and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
