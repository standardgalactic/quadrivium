About the author
About the author
John Watton BSc PhD DSc FREng FIMechE CEng 
The author has taken a broad approach to the study of fluid power control, covering a period of almost 
forty years. He started his career in industry working on heat exchangers and then obtained BSc and 
PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. He returned to industry as a systems engineer working on 
the automated electrohydraulic steering control of mobile light-guided vehicles. Following a period at 
Huddersfield Polytechnic, where he was involved in developing electromechanical control systems, he 
then moved to Cardiff University. He set up a new fluid power laboratory and developed new courses 
in fluid power and condition monitoring which he taught together with control theory, fluid mechanics 
and dynamics. He has published over 170 papers and 4 books on fluid power and has supervised many 
MSc and PhD students. He was awarded the degree of DSc for his contributions to fluid power and 
became Professor of Fluid Power. 
Industrial work has included the co-design of other novel mobile machines for agricultural and civil 
engineering applications, and moving into commercial operation. He has originated and managed some 
major projects in the steel processing industry with some moving to plant on-line implementation. 
Projects have varied from continuous casting, bar and strip rolling through high speed mills, strip 
quality/coiling and no-twist mill wire production. Savings due to improved production have run into 
many millions of pounds. He has also undertaken a variety of consultancy projects for the fluid power 
industry, varying from component analysis and design to hydraulic control strategies for high-power 
forging presses. He has also been active as an Expert Witness on fluid power issues varying from system 
failures to patent litigation.
He was awarded the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Bramah Medal and received an honour from 
the Japan Fluid Power Society. He is a Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He is now retired from Cardiff University, 
taking the title of Emeritus Professor, but has since undertaken further book writing together with 
consultancy projects for industry.

Preface
Preface
Fluid power is used in a vast range of applications, often with fast response times and for power levels 
that can be up to several MW and where no other form of actuation is feasible. Fluid power control 
systems may be placed in environmentally-difficult applications and increasingly with alternative fluids 
to pure mineral oil. A useful feature is that they almost always have a more competitive power/weight 
ratio when compared with electrically actuated systems, and have the capability of being able to accurately 
control several parameters such as pressure, force, speed, position. 
This book specifically considers the application of electrohydraulic valves in control systems, an extremely 
important part of fluid power. The aim is to bring together various key aspects and up to a design level 
beyond a basic text but without an overload of fundamental derivations. Some background theory is still 
considered essential but only at a level that allows the reader to get a ‘feel’ for how it is used in practice. 
The layout of the book is such that the reader may progress through it from basics of steady-state operation 
to essential concepts of dynamic design and control. This book is divided into 9 chapters covering:
•	 how and why electrohydraulic valves work
•	 the performance of open-loop and closed-loop servoactuators
•	 the effect of system dynamics
•	 the derivation and use of block diagrams for design
•	 computer simulation using Matlab Simulink and Control System Toolbox
•	 the stability of closed-loop systems
•	 the use of Programmable Servo Controllers for control and performance improvement
Other important features of this book are the use of real data and performance characteristics together 
with 27 worked examples of varying complexity. A brief list of references is included to take the reader 
towards several hundred other references and more advanced techniques continually being researched 
and developed. The reader will find much more detailed theoretical and experimental information from 
these references and also from two of the author’s earlier, and more substantial, supporting books.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
1	 An introduction to the operation 
of electrohydraulic valves 
1.1	
Aim
This chapter introduces the reader to the basics of operation of electrohydraulic valves by a number of 
objectives as follows:
•	 to give examples on how they are used in practice
•	 to explain how and why electrohydraulic valves work
•	 to show some different designs of industrial servovalves
1.2	
Electrohydraulic valves, direction and pressure relief types
This book is primarily concerned with the design of control systems employing electrohydraulic 
servovalves and related electrohydraulic proportional valves, both often being simply referred to 
as servovalves.
The combination of a servovalve and a connected linear cylinder for position control, or a motor for 
speed control, may be referred to as a servodrive although it should be noted that servovalves may be 
used to control other parameters such as pressure and force. Figure 1.1 shows just two examples of 
many commercial servodrives available. A single-rod cylinder is shown although double-rod cylinders 
are commonly used, the “inactive end” often being enclosed for both safety and assembly purposes.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
It should be pointed out at this stage that strictly speaking the term ‘electrohydraulic’ is not restricted 
to servovalves since it can be applied to directional control valves, proportional pressure relief valves 
or any fluid power device that uses an electrical input signal to change its fluid power output function. 
However in the context of control, electrohydraulic valves are used here to indicate that the output flow 
rate can be varied proportionally to the electrical input signal. 
Figure 1.2 shows a basic directional control valve which is really an on-off valve for selecting flow rate 
direction. Applying a voltage, either ac or dc, to either of the solenoids creates an electromagnetic force 
that throws the spool to the end of its stroke thus opening the appropriate flow ports. Usually with 
no solenoid actuation the spool returns to its central position. The spool ports can have a variety of 
configurations depending upon the requirement, and this type of valve is the backbone of many industrial 
applications requiring sequencing-type operations.

Figure 1.2  A directional control valve with solenoid actuation
A pressure relief valve (PRV) with off-loading is another form of electrohydraulic component and a 
two stage PRV is shown as figure 1.3. A pilot pressure can also be applied to the valve to cause it to 
open at a minimum pressure and this is useful for sequencing operations. The pressure is normally 
hydromechanically set but in this example the PRV has an added stage that can off-load the system 
pressure by opening the top port via a spool valve with solenoid control. The use of a remote electrical 
signal can be invaluable as an energy saving operation if the full system pressure is not needed during 
a manufacturing cycle.

Figure 1.3 A two stage pressure relief valve with off-loading
The first stage stiff spring is used to set the required system pressure. When the set force, equivalent 
to set pressure, is overcome at the first stage then the poppet attempts to open by a very small amount 
allowing a smaller pressure to be fed to the top of the second stage spool, which has a much weaker 
spring, allowing the system flow rate to pass through the valve and return back to tank. This is a much 
better way of off-loading flow rate rather than using a single stage valve with a stiff spring. Flow rate is 
off-loaded more quickly compared with a single stage valve and the increase in system pressure with 
flow rate through the second stage is much less pronounced than with a single stage valve. A two stage 
valve is less prone to vibration of the moving parts compared with a single stage valve, and helped by 
the damping orifice at the top of the second stage.
An electrohydraulic pressure relief valve is shown in figure 1.4 where in this case the system pressure 
may be set directly via a variable input voltage to the “proportional solenoid”, that is the solenoid is 
designed to produce a force that is ostensibly proportional to its applied current.

Figure 1.4 A two stage pressure relief valve with electrical control
The application of an increasing voltage to the solenoid produces an electromagnetic force that attempts 
to move its poppet to the left thus increasing the resistance to flow through the conical poppet/restrictor 
and hence the pressure at the valve first stage. The operation of the second stage spool is then as described 
for the valve shown as figure 1.3.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
Figure 1.5 shows measurements taken by the author on two commercial PRVs. For the first valve 
the pressure/voltage relationship is highly non-linear at low pressures, and with a poor hysteresis 
characteristic. Hysteresis is dominated by the electromagnetic component of the valve such that if the 
applied voltage direction is changed then the pressure does not immediately respond until a small voltage 
threshold change has occurred. The second valve shows a much better characteristic with a much reduced 
hysteresis characteristic. 
These characteristics do show the importance of understanding the application performance required 
and then selecting the correct proportional pressure relief valve. However, a poor hysteresis characteristic 
may well be acceptable for a particular application.

 Figure 1.5 Two proportional pressure relief valve characteristics
Fortunately, or perhaps by good design, the non-linear region for the first valve is within a low pressure 
range that is probably not needed for the important part of the duty cycle, apart perhaps for pressure 
off-loading. For pressures beyond 25bar the characteristic has an acceptable near-linear relationship 
although the hysteresis evident is a disadvantage for closed-loop dynamic control of pressure. Solenoids 
of the type being discussed here usually operate with a high current of typically 1A→ 2A.

 Figure 1.6 A linear servodrive in open-loop and closed-loop modes
Figure 1.6 also shows the power supply consisting of a positive displacement pump with a pressure relief 
valve to set the supply pressure and protect the system when flow is not demanded by the servodrive. 
Note that for the servodrives illustrated the servovalve is mounted, via its manifold block, on the actuator 
to minimise fluid volumes and their associated compressibility effects. This ensures the highest possible 
hydraulic undamped natural frequency of the system, as will be discussed later. However if fluid volumes 
are very small, for example at the ends following full stroke in either direction, then very high rates of 
pressure change within small volumes can cause control stability problems in some applications. 
Consider first the open-loop servodrive shown as figure 1.6a). The application of an input voltage to the 
electronic controller causes the actuator to move at a particular velocity as dictated by the servovalve 
supply pressure and load force characteristic to which the actuator is connected. Doubling the input 
voltage will double the actuator velocity, more-or-less. Since the application of an input voltage creates 
actuator motion then this is an integrator characteristic, a very useful and inherent property of a 
servovalve/actuator for closed-loop position control. The actuator will continue to move unless the 
servovalve input signal is removed or closed-loop position control is introduced.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
For the closed-loop position servodrive shown in figure 1.6b), if the demanded position voltage exceeds 
the actual position voltage, from its position sensor, then the net error voltage to the servovalve causes it 
to supply flow to the actuator. Hence the actuator moves, reducing the error, and the error voltage, with 
time until the error between the demanded position voltage and the actual position voltage is zero and the 
load comes to rest at the demanded position. Setting a low servoamplifier gain will cause the motion to 
be sluggish whereas a higher servoamplifier gain will cause the motion to be fast and possibly oscillatory. 
A good design will cause the desired position to be achieved in an optimum manner but it is crucial to 
note here that increasing the servoamplifier gain to an increasingly higher value will eventually create 
an unstable closed-loop behaviour due to system dynamic effects, and which is clearly undesirable. 
An electronic controller is needed to accept the various electrical signals and then form the signal that 
is sent to the servovalve. It is a combination of a summing junction/servoamplifier and receives the 
command signal, and the feedback (subtracted) signal for closed-loop control, and sends the resulting 
error voltage, converted to a current, to the servovalve coils. The basic amplifier cards used in most 
applications have several analogue input and output channels and represent high-quality low-cost 
approaches for closed-loop control.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
For research and development, test rigs and more advanced control applications a digital controller may 
be used with programmable facilities that can significantly improve performance. These programmable 
controllers are now standard supply by the servovalve manufacturer. Note that some servovalves have 
integrated electronics within the cap thus simplifying the electrical connection. 
Figure 1.7 shows a Programmable Servo Controller, referred to as a PSC, and in this example on a test rig 
used by the author to identify dynamics and then improve the control of a racing car active suspension.
 Figure 1.7 A Moog Programmable Servo Controller (PSC)
The controller shown in figure 1.7 is the Moog MSC I and is best suited for applications where one or 
two actuators need to be controlled via an analogue interface. Typical applications are the closed-loop 
control of one or two hydraulic axes. The PSC is set up by connecting a PC and using the Moog Axis 
Control Software (MACS). The controller has many features, but for the purpose of this application some 
of the 8 analogue input channels and 2 analogue output channels, with 16 bit resolution, were used. 
The analogue input/outputs may be operated in either current or voltage mode depending on hardware 
default settings. The PSC card is programmed by means of a serial set up link which is connected to a 
PC. Once a program has been down loaded to the card it is not necessary to maintain the set up link with 
the PC as the PSC contains its own microprocessor and storage facilities. However, it may be necessary 
to maintain the link in order to make changes to the setup, supervise the performance, or monitor the 
values of control parameters. The PSC can be set up to perform advanced closed-loop control with up 
to two nested control loops for each axis of control. All the required summations, filters, limiters and 
non-linear functions, etc. can be structured using a text based programming language. Commands can 
either be entered directly from a PC or stored in an ASCII text file and down loaded from the PC to 
the PSC in blocks.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
The Moog MSC II controller is best suited for applications where multiple axes need to be controlled via 
a fieldbus interface, and also uses the MACS programming software. Typical applications are closed-loop 
control with or without profile generation of multiple electric or hydraulic axes. Computations cycle 
times are extremely fast but for control of hydraulic systems it is usual to use a sampling frequency 
of typically 500→1000Hz since higher frequencies will tend to sample undesirable noise and other 
hydraulic frequencies. More specification and performance details of these controllers may be found in 
(www.Moog.com). 
Electrohydraulic control system design is really about selecting the correct servovalve for the application 
and integrating it into a system to give an acceptable system steady-state and dynamic behaviour. 
1.4	
Servovalve operation and design
Consider now some common types of servovalve design. The electrohydraulic servovalve, with a  
flapper nozzle stage, was invented by William C Moog in the early 1950s, the design being as shown in 
figure 1.8. The earliest form of internal feedback, to set the spool position, used springs placed at each 
end of the spool. The symbol T is the tank connection and 3V is the supply pressure connection.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
An input current to the coils of the electromagnetic torque motor creates a deflection of the flapper 
which then creates a pressure differential 3D±3E This is applied across the spool which moves it in the 
appropriate direction and at a constant velocity if no restraining force is present. The pressure differential 
is created by use of two nozzles and two orifices and the final spool displacement is determined when the 
applied hydraulic force across the spool is matched by the resisting spring force at that displacement. The 
flapper remains at its displaced position during operation with a constant input signal. It can be shown 
that dynamic performance is possibly slightly deteriorated from the case when the flapper is in its null 
condition. Flapper clearance has to be very small in all servovalve designs to minimise flow loss and 
hence power loss, so the nozzle with the reduced clearance when operating is susceptable to fluid particle 
blockage particularly in the presence of poor filtration. The introduction of this new electrohydraulic 
valve had a major impact in the hydraulic control field.
The electromagnetic first stage, or torque motor, is achieved by using a pair of small wire-wound solenoids, 
combined with an armature/flapper, which are then placed within a pair of permanent magnets as shown 
in figure 1.9.

 Figure 1.10 Coil pair connections possible
Application of a small current, of the order of mA, then creates an electromagnetic field along the axis 
of the armature and the generated magnetic poles react with the poles of the permanent magnets. This 
causes a very small rotation of the armature/flapper and the very small displacement, [Q, at the end of 
the flapper is used to generate a pressure differential that is applied across the spool to move it.
Consider next how this pressure differential may be generated; two methods discussed here are the 
flapper/nozzle and the jet pipe. The flapper/nozzle stage is the earliest method of generating a pressure 
differential which is achieved using a pair of very small diameter restrictors, or orifices, either side of 
the flapper. This resistance bridge is similar to an electrical voltage potential divider and is shown as 
figure 1.11.

 Figure 1.11 The hydraulic first stage flapper/nozzle concept
With the flapper centralised the pressures 3D and 3E are equal and typically around half supply pressure 
3V although the actual value depends upon the choice of restrictor diameters. A small displacement 
[Q to the left as shown will increase the nozzle restriction at side ‘a’ and decrease the nozzle restriction 
at side ‘b’. Consequently pressure 3D will increase and pressure 3E will decrease. The combined effect is 
that a pressure differential 3D±3E is generated and is then sensed across the spool. By careful selection 
of the restrictor diameters and the clearance either side of the flapper a reasonably-linear relationship 
between pressure differential and torque motor input current can be designed over a good operating 
range. The normalised characteristic is typically as shown in figure 1.12 and determined using real 
servovalve data. The maximum pressure differential generated at maximum flapper displacement, for 
the design parameters selected here, is 80% of the supply pressure.

Consider next the use of a jet pipe rather than a flapper/nozzle to generate the pressure differential as 
shown in figure 1.13. The jet pipe device is essentially a fluidic device and produces a jet that diverges 
in width, and height to a smaller extent, due to fluid entrainment as it progresses downstream towards 
the two receivers, eventually with a Gaussian-type velocity profile in the dominant plane shown.

Consequently the two receivers, or diffusers, will only collect part of the total flow rate available due to 
their finite widths. The jet pipe is moved by the torque motor and with the jet pipe at the central, null, 
condition the pressure recovered in each receiver will be equal with the sum being less than supply 
pressure due to jet spillage. Analysis of this type of device is difficult due to its complicated practical 
shape but the pressure differential recovery characteristic will be similar to that shown in figure 1.14, 
and again calculated using real servovalve data.

This characteristic was derived by the author from a two-dimensional analysis of a typical fluid jet with 
an established Gaussian velocity profile. The useable near-linear region is much less than for the flapper/
nozzle bridge but this type of device is now in commercial use. The maximum pressure recovery may 
be less than a flapper/nozzle device but a stated advantage of the jet pipe is that it is less susceptable to 
fluid particle blockage compared with the flapper/nozzle approach.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
The second hydraulic stage is the spool which is moved by the pressure differential applied across it. 
Figure 1.15 shows just three common spool designs with circumferential grooves to minimise hydraulic 
lock. The faces at each port where flow may exist are known as the spool lands. Spool lands perfectly 
matched are known as critically-lapped lands. Lands deliberately overcut to minimise flow loss at the 
null condition are known as over-lapped lands, and lands deliberately undercut are known as under-
lapped lands.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
In all cases the flow slots machined around the spool sleeve are rectangular and hence the area exposed 
varies in a linear manner with spool displacement. For perfectly matched, critically-lapped, lands a small 
displacement of the spool, to the left in figure 1.15, opens supply pressure and allows flow through its 
port to the load actuator. The return flow from the actuator passes across the return port back to tank. 
Usually the two tank return ports are internally connected and the two pressure ports are internally 
connected. In practice a servovalve must be connected to the hydraulic system using a connecting, or 
manifold, block that is bolted to it. This manifold block will have screwed connection for supply pressure, 
tank, the two output ports and the valve is termed a 4-way valve. 
Historically, the servovalve with spool spring force feedback was then modified to a servovalve with 
force feedback. This still uses the flapper/nozzle concept, but with an added feedback wire that has a ball 
at its end, the ball fitting into a matched groove around the spool as shown in figure 1.16. 
 Figure 1.16 Servovalve with force feedback
The ball is typically manufactured from carbide or sapphire, both giving a similar wear characteristic 
and much better then stainless steel. Furthermore, developments of the ball-in-hole method of retaining 
the ball, rather than ball-in-slot method shown, has improved reliability and is becoming the preferred 
approach for a class of servovalves [www.moog.com]. Restrictors used in flapper/nozzle devices can now 
also be manufactured from sapphire to ensure dimensional accuracy and repeatability together with a 
significantly improved wear characteristic.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
When a current is applied to the servovalve then the flapper is rapidly displaced causing spool 
displacement. This spool displacement then bends the feedback wire which creates a reacting torque to 
balance that generated electrmagnetically. It can be shown by careful design that when the electromagnetic 
and mechanical torques are balanced then the flapper returns to its null condition, spool motion stops 
and the spool displacement becomes proportional to the input current as required. An analysis of the 
dynamic behaviour of the flapper/nozzle stage is beyond the remit of this book but it does seem that 
flapper centralisation gives the best dynamic performance. A commercial torque motor design is shown 
as figure 1.17.

An introduction to the operation of electrohydraulic valves
If a servovalve with a jet pipe is used then there is no connection between the jet pipe and spool as was 
the case with the flapper/nozzle/springs or the flapper/nozzle/wire devices previously described. The 
approach here is to add a spool position sensor and the servovalve is then known as a servovalve with 
spool position electrical feedback. This makes good control sense since the parameter being controlled, 
spool position, is directly measured. This concept is shown in figure 1.21.

 Figure 1.21 The jet pipe concept with spool position electrical feedback
The actual position voltage is compared with its demanded value and the error voltage, when converted 
to a drive current, is fed to the servovalve torque motor. The nature of this control loop has a zero 
steady state error when the spool achieves its demanded position. Since the error signal to move the 
jet pipe is now zero then the jet pipe is centralised in a similar way to a servovalve with force feedback 
described earlier. 
A vast range of servovalves are commercially available and just two servovalves from the range 
manufactured by Moog are shown as figure 1.22. The first shown is the flapper/nozzle pilot and force 
feedback type and the second is the jet-pipe pilot and spool position feedback type.

 Figure 1.23 A linear force motor [www.moog.com]
The motor is a pair of high energy rare earth magnets and without an input current the magnets 
and springs hold the armature at equilibrium. When an input current is applied to the coil with one 
polarity the flux in one of the air gaps surrounding the magnets is increased, cancelling out the flux in 
the other. This non-equilibrium condition allows the armature to move in the direction of the stronger 
flux. The armature is moved in the opposite direction by changing the polarity of the input current in 
the coil [www.moog.com]. More force is generated when compared with a conventional solenoid, for 
example as used for the directional valve shown in figure 1.2, and at a significantly lower drive current. 
Figure 1.24 shows how a linear force motor is combined within the hydraulic stage of the valve. The 
spool is connected to the force motor armature and the displacement of the spool is proportional to the 
input current applied.

Servovalve flow characteristics
2	 Servovalve flow characteristics
2.1	
Aim
This chapter aims to introduce the reader to the basic servovalve flow rate characteristics for steady-state 
behaviour by introducing a number of objectives as follows:
•	 to consider the origin of the basic flow rate equations
•	 to consider the different types of common spool lands 
•	 to develop the linearised flow rate equations for later use in systems dynamic analysis
•	 to illustrate performance by worked examples
2.2	
Servovalve flow characteristics, critically-lapped spool
To understand the flow rate characteristic it is necessary to consider the steady-state flow rate through 
each port. Consider therefore a cross section through a servovalve shown as figure 2.1. The spool is 
critically-lapped such that the smallest spool movement causes the ports to open. 
To determine the flow characteristics in practice the output ports are connected via a restrictor valve 
that may be manually adjusted. Notice the flow meter placed in the load line to measure the flow rate.

Figure 2.1 A servovalve with ctitically-lapped ports having equal flow rates
Each port around the spool bush that houses the spool is machined as a group of rectangular slots, 
typically four, and equally-spaced around the spool bush periphery. Because the spool movement is 
usually very small then the flow rate equation across the ostensibly-matched ports obeys the Bernoulli 
form of flow equation.

where Cf is a flow coefficient to represent losses, ȡ is the fluid density and ¨S is the pressure drop across

Servovalve flow characteristics
One way of looking at the non-linear flow characteristic is to consider small variations about a particular 
steady-state operating point i(o), Pℓ(o), Q(o) and the process is called linearisation of the non-linear 
flow rate equation into a linear equation. This is useful when considering system dynamics, as will be 
pursued later. For small variations of current, įL, and small variations in load pressure, į3Ɛ, then using 
the first two linear terms of the Taylor series expansion of equation (2.6) gives the approximate small 
change in flow rate į4  as follows:

Each port now has three paths, in, out, and leakage back to tank. As with the previous case of a critically-
lapped spool, each port is assumed to have identical flow rate characteristics for each port. The flow rate 
equations within the under-lap region only are now as follows for a positive current and the direction 
convention shown:

This non-dimensional flow characteristic is shown as figure 2.4, again for positive current and for spool 
displacements only within the underlap region. Beyond the region of underlap then the flow equation 
equation obeys the conventional critically-lapped form previously discussed. Given that in reality any 
inherent, or deliberately-machined, under-lap will be very small then flow rates given by equation (2.16) 
will also be very small.

Servovalve flow characteristics
Note that the flow rate may be zero for a finite load pressure and a finite servovalve current. This leads 
to the conclusion that:
“A position control system can have a steady-state error if the servovalve spool is symetrically under-
lapped. It can be made zero, or significantly minimised, by the selection of an appropriate load condition”
This will be pursued later. The linearised coefficients may be easily be derived for the under-lapped 
spool by considering the appropriate partial differentials of equation (2.15) in the same way as for  
the critically-lapped spool. These are not presented here in full but at the the null condition  
i(o) = 0, Pℓ(o) = 0, the linearised coefficients are compared for the two types of spool lands:

Servovalve flow characteristics
Two important consclusions arise as follows:
•	 the pressure gain and pressure sensitivity are now finite and note that the flow gain is double 
that for a critically-lapped valve as given earler by equation (2.13). This may be practically 
used to identify whether or not a servovalve spool has under-lap
•	 a servovalve will have a flow rate loss at the null condition and therefore a servovalve with 
under-lap has a finite resistance at the null condition. A finite resistance implies damping and 
advantageous during dynamic operation, although in practice it may only have a minor effect
The three types of land laps may now be compared using the idealised flow/current graph shown 
schematically in figure 2.5. The flow characteristics are idealised since the transition from under/over-
lap to critical-lap is smooth in practice, but any change around zero current is usually identifiable. Note 
that in figure 2.5 the under-lap/over-lap region is not to a realistic scale.

Valve rating
A servovalve manufucturer will specify the steady-state flow rate capability of a servovalve in terms of the 
rated flow, 4UDWHG. This is specified in relation to the rated current, LUDWHG, and for a valve total pressure 
drop of ∆p = 70bar across the two ports.
Total pressure drop across the two ports ∆P = (Ps – P1)  + (P2 – 0) 
∆P  = Ps – Pℓ

where Pℓ = P1 – P2 is the load pressure. But by definition of valve rating then ∆P = 70bar and therefore: 
At the valve rating Ps – Pℓ = 70bar 
Using the valve rated flow specified by the manufacturer then the flow at any other supply pressure, load 
pressure and current is obtained from equation (2.6), for a critically-lapped valve, to give:

Servovalve specification by the manufacturer
A consideration of the way a manufacturer specifies servovalve performance is now appropriate. The 
data provided will be typically as follows:
General 
•	 class of protection
•	 temperature range, for example -30oC → 130oC
•	 recommended fluid and viscosity
•	 filtration, filter rating, cleanliness including ISO class
•	 installation and vibration data, for example up to 30g at all axes
Specific, steady-state
•	 operating pressure, for example 14bar→ 315bar
•	 proof pressure, for example 470bar at P port or 310bar at T port
•	 type of pilot stage and optional connection
•	 rated flow @ 70bar valve pressure drop
•	 rated flow tolerance, for example ±10%
•	 symmetry, for example < 10%
•	 threshold, for example < 0.5% typically measure at a supply pressure of 210bar
•	 hysteresis, for example < 3% typically measure at a supply pressure of 210bar
•	 null shift, typically < 2% and temperature specified
•	 dimensions
•	 electrical connection data
•	 internal leakage data, for example < 4% of the rated flow rate

Servovalve flow characteristics
Example 2.1
A servovalve flow characteristic for a flapper/nozzle and force feedback servovalve with ports connected 
using a variable restrictor, and measured by the author, is as shown.
Notice how the fitted square root characteristic matches extremely well over the measurement range 
although measurements at very low current is difficult in practice due to the resolution of the flow meter 
electronic measuring sensor used at the correspondingly-low flow rates.

Servovalve flow characteristics
It can be seen that the characteristic around zero current is not linear. The doubling of flow gain compared 
with higher currents shows that the spool lands have a small under-lap. 
From the data the flow gain NTL when Pℓ = 0 may be used to determine the flow constant NI. Note that 
away from the very small under-lap zone the valve spool behaves like a critically-lapped spool and the 
appropriate flow gain must be used.

Maximum power transfer to the load and selection of supply pressure
Maximum power to the load means that the load may be accelerated at its maximum value, if this is 
desired. Since hydraulic power is defined as flow rate multiplied by pressure then, assuming that the 
flow into the load actuator is the same as the flow out of the load actuator and also a critically-lapped 
spool, then equation (2.6) applies giving:

This power transfer is independent of the actuator speed for an ideal system with no flow losses and 
mechanical losses. It can be seen from equation (2.21) that the power at a particular current varies from 
zero when Pℓ = 0 through to a maximum value and then back to zero when the load pressure equals 
supply pressure Pℓ = Ps. Differentiating (2.21) with respect to load pressure and equating to zero to find 
the condition of maximum power transfer gives:
Ps = 1.5 Pℓ

So, select a supply pressure 50% higher than the load pressure to give maximum steady-state power 
transfer. In practice this rule is generally used to also provide sufficient supply power to overcome the 
load steady-state and dynamic requirement.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Servovalve flow characteristics
Example 2.2
Select a servovalve for an application with a linear actuator size and speed requiring a flow rate of 
20litres/min at a load pressure differential of 120bar. A particular servovalve model has a range of sizes 
defined by the following rated flows:
a)	 4 litres/min
b)	 10 litres/min
c)	 19 litres/min
d)	 38 litres/min
e)	 63 litres/min
The rated current is ±20mA for series connected coils. 
Minimum supply pressure 14bar
Maximum supply pressure 315bar
Select a supply pressure to ensure optimum power transfer such that Ps = 1.5Pℓ.
Ps = 1.5×120 = 180bar
Comparing the flow rate to the rated flow rated at the same rated current gives:

•	 Servovalve e) may also be used at around 34% of the rated current.

It is better to use as much current as possible over the maximum flow range experienced. Therefore use 
servovalve c) but change the supply pressure to maximise current while maintaining optimum power 
transfer such that Ps = 1.5Pℓ.

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
3	 Connecting a servovalve to an 
actuator, steady-state behaviour
3.1	
Aim
This aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the basic servovalve/actuator combinations and to 
understand their steady-state behaviour via a number of objectives as follows:
•	 to present the actuator ideal flow rate and force/torque equations
•	 to determine the ideal performance of various servovalve/actuator combinations
•	 to introduce the basic practical losses and show their effect on performance
•	 to illustrate performance through worked examples
•	 to demonstrate the practical use of a Programmable Servo Controller to improve steady-
state performance
3.2	
Connecting a servovalve to a cylinder, the open-loop 
steady-state behaviour
Consider first the general case of a single-rod actuator and in open-loop control mode as shown in 
figure 3.1. The application of an input voltage to the controller/servoamplifier causes the actuator to 
either extend or retract depending on the sign of the voltage. In the absence of any variation such as 
temperature, supply pressure or load conditions then a fixed voltage will create a fixed velocity.

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
Assuming a critically-lapped servovalve spool then the flow from the servovalve output port into the 
actuator and the flow out of the actuator into the servovalve return port must be equal to the actuator 
velocity multiplied by actuator cross-sectional-area. Also the net hydraulic force must balance the load 
force. It then follows that:

This is usually the case in practice and it is concluded that, with the same servovalve current applied 
in each direction, the retracting velocity will probably be greater than the extending velocity for an 
open-loop linear servodrive with optimum supply pressure setting. 
An interesting feature of a single-rod actuator is that the extending speed and the retracting speed can 
be made equal from (3.5) to give:

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
where $URG is the cross-sectional-area of the rod. Selecting such a design would appear to make intuitive 
sense from a closed-loop control systems design point of view although there may be some cases for 
simple extend/retract systems where it is desirable to retract, for example, as quickly as possible.

Connecting a servovalve to a motor, the closed-loop steady-state behaviour
A speed sensor is now secured to the motor drive shaft, as shown in figure 3.3, and produces a voltage 
proportional to speed. The motor speed sensor voltage is subtracted from the demanded speed equivalent 
voltage as shown to form a closed-loop speed control system.

The equations for this basic system with no losses or dynamic effects are as follows:

where 9G is the demanded voltage equivalent of the demanded position, *D mA/V is the servoamplifier

equivalent is given by: 
Demand voltage 9G +ȦȦG
and therefore L *D+Ȧ>ȦG±Ȧ@

Figure 3.4 Comparison of open-loop and closed-loop control of a motor speed, no motor losses or dynamics
Some interesting points arise from this steady-state analysis:
•	 the effect of simply closing the loop is clear from figure 3.4 since the speed drop is less 
pronounced with increasing load pressure, and for any closed-loop gain
•	 closed-loop control does not prevent the speed falling to zero at maximum load pressure
•	 the speed drop characteristic can be further improved by increasing the closed-loop gain K 
but in practice the effect of inherent system dynamics will cause the motor speed to eventually 
oscillate. This is a dangerous condition for a motor having a number of internal pistons/vanes 
that can bounce and cause severe damage. 
3.5	
Connecting a servovalve to a cylinder, the closed-loop position 
transient response
Consider now a closed-loop servodrive using a linear actuator as shown in figure 3.5. Due to the 
integration from velocity to position, this position control system behaves in a transient manner when 
position change is demanded, even in absence of system dynamics. For this preliminary look at closed-
loop control the following conditions are set:
•	 a double-rod type having a net cross-sectional-area A
•	 the load pressure is constant, for example due to a constant resisting force F
•	 no load mass and actuator fluid compressibility, no servovalve dynamics
•	 a critically-lapped servovalve spool

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
Clearly to make the response faster the time constant τ must be reduced which may be achieved by 
reducing the numerator of τ in (3.22) and/or increasing the denominator. The response may be made 
faster, if feasible in practice, by:
•	 reducing the actuator cross-sectional-area A, that is using a smaller cylinder
•	 increasing kf , that is increasing the servovalve flow rating
•	 reducing Pℓ(o), that is reducing the load force F
•	 increasing the supply pressure 3V at a fixed load
•	 increasing the gains *D and/or Hp. 
In practice increasing the gains *D and +S will eventually lead to closed-loop instability due to other 
dynamic aspects not considered here such as servovalve dynamics and load dynamics. When this 
occurs in actuator position control systems, sometimes pressure oscillations are more evident than 
position oscillations.
If the load mass is very small then often the transient response of a real position control system will 
probably be dominated by this first-order characteristic. 
Example 3.3
Consider a closed-loop servodrive with a double-rod cylinder. Determine the transient response as the 
servoamplifier gain *D is varied and using the following data:
Bore diameter 50mm, rod diameter 28mm
Actuator stroke 150mm
Servovalve flow constant kf = 0.2, rated flow @20mA 
Supply pressure 3V = 140bar 
Position sensor gain Hp = 10V/m
No load F = 0

For full stroke the voltage generated by the position sensor is (10)(0.15) = 1.5V
The maximum voltage error 9HUURU = 1.5V
The current generated L *D9HUURU
Therefore at the rated current of 20mA the servoamplifier gain *D = 20/1.5 = 13.33mA/V
Servoamplifier gains above this value will cause servovalve flow saturation and the actuator will move 
at a constant speed. At the working supply pressure 3V = 140bar and no load:

The closed-loop time constant at the point of flow saturation τ = 0.36sec 
A servoamplifier gain *D >13.33mA/V will cause the servovalve flow rate to just saturate. Computer 
simulation results are shown for a servoamplifier gain *D=13.33 and also for *D= 4 and 50. Note velocity 
saturation at the highest gain shown.

Up to a servoamplifier gain of *D=13.33mA/V the response behaves in a linear exponential manner 
as expected. Higher gains are not detrimental since initial velocity saturation moves the cylinder at its 
highest velocity and actually improves the transient response.

Servodrive damping, leakage and friction losses, efficiency 
The main contribution to system damping are:
•	 leakages at the actuator
•	 viscous resistance due to actuator motion within the working fluid
•	 servovalve flow leakage

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
First consider leakages at the actuator. These are due to the inherent clearances that must exist due to 
internal motion between components that experience a pressure differential across them. Leakages are 
usually assumed to be proportional to the pressure difference across the leakage path. Leakage across a 
linear actuator piston tends to be low but leakages usually cannot be neglected for a motor which has 
many internal leakage flow paths.

The concept of resistance is again used where now 5L is the leakage series resistance across the linear 
actuator piston, 5L and 5H are the motor internal and external resistances due to cross-port and other 
leakages. Clearly a correctly functioning linear actuator has no significant external leakage from the rod 
seals but piston motors do have external leakage via the case drain connection to tank. 
The motor equations used here are those established by the author from measurements on just two 
motors of the same design and they may vary slightly for other designs. Also the relative importance of 
different leakages for a motor is difficult to pre-judge in practice since it is not possible to obtain detailed 
loss data for every motor commercially available. To get a feel for the probable system equations the 
mean flow rate may be used as follows:

where 5DFW is a general leakage term for either actuator. 
The force and torque equations must also be modified to include viscous and mechanical losses. The 
first loss component, the viscous friction loss, is due to the motion of internal components within the 
viscous working fluid. It is usually assumed that this loss is proportional to velocity as follows:
Viscous friction force loss for a cylinder = %Y U
	
Viscous friction torque loss for a motor = %Y Ȧ
Now consider the mechanical friction loss which can be affected by both speed and pressure, and is 
generally considered to have two dominant components. The first component is the zero-speed stiction 
component and the second component is a constant Coulomb friction component that is independent 
of speed. This combined stiction/Coulomb friction characteristic is shown in figure 3.8.

Hence, when a servovalve is connected to either a linear actuator or a motor then the actual linear

The following figure shows the results up to a load pressure differential of 82bar. The maximum efficiency 
achieved is 57.8% at a pressure differential of 80bar. The ideal efficiency, that is, with no losses, at this 
load pressure differential would of course be 80%. The drop in speed from the no-loss case is small and 
only becomes noticeable at high load pressure differentials beyond maximum efficiency.

The measured data fits well with the theoretical model illustrating its validity over the load pressure 
differential range. Notice the minimum speed at a finite load pressure differential and the difficulty in 
obtaining measurements at a high load pressure differential due to the low motor speed and its fluctuation 
due to the piston pumping effect of the (motor + load pump).

Connecting a servovalve to an actuator, steady-state behaviour
3.7	
Improving the steady-state performance of an open-loop motor servodrive 
using a Programmable Servo Controller 
This is particularly useful for open-loop motor drives where an increasing load pressure differential 
inherently reduces motor speed due to the square root effect of the servovalve. Attempting to change 
the square-root characteristic to a linear characteristic will continually drive the servovalve current to 
a new value to minimise the square-root effect on motor speed. In addition the supply pressure may be 
continually varied to optimise the drive efficiency. 
Consider a practical validation by the author on a uni-directional motor drive with a commercially-
available proportional servovalve having just one control port active, that is one side of the motor is 
pressurised and the other side is returned to tank at a very low, and constant, pressure of ≈ 9bar. This 
means that only one active pressure has to be measured with a pressure sensor. The motor is loaded 
with a pump whose output pressure is varied using a proportional pressure relief valve with electrical 
control. Therefore both steady-state and dynamic testing could be undertaken. The actual supply pressure 
was also measured using a pressure sensor and this was useful for other dynamic improvements that 
will be discussed in the section on dynamic behaviour. The open-loop drive is shown as figure 3.9. First 
consider servovalve linearisation.

Figure 3.9 Linearisation of a servovalve flow characteristic and supply pressure adaption using a Programmable Servo 
Controller (PSC)
A flow meter was placed in the inlet line to determine the servovalve flow characteristic in detail and 
both load and supply pressures can be varied electrically using electrohydraulic proportional pressure 
relief valves (two PRV’s). 
A Moog two-axis Programmable Servo Controller (PSC) card, as introduced in Chapter 1, was used to 
monitor the signals, carry out the on-line computations and provide the corrective control voltages. The 
servovalve flow characteristic was experimentally-determined to be as follows:

V is the applied voltage. Linearisation attempts to create a “virtual servovalve” by electronically generating 
a flow characteristic that is independent of load pressure as follows:

This process of linearisation therefore requires a multiplication factor on 9G that increases → ∞ as the 
load pressure P1→Ps. There must be a finite limit that can be achieved by the programmable controller 
and hence the servovalve flow characteristic cannot be linearised over its entire pressure differential 
range in practice, in fact for small values of (Ps – P1). In this application a maximum voltage of 6V was 
set for the PSC. Figure 3.10 shows the effect of linearisation on the flow rate.

 Figure 3.10 Flow characteristics for a servovalve without and with linearisation
The linearisation process works sufficiently well above a pressure differential of ≈ 15bar and particularly 
for lower flow rates and hence lower motor speeds. These are real results and show that an idealised 
linearization cannot be achieved in practice. 
Now consider supply pressure adaption to maintain optimum efficiency using a PRV to continually 
adjust supply pressure as shown in figure 3.9. The efficiency of the drive and the supply pressure PRV 
characteristic were measured and are shown as figure 3.11.

where 4V is the pump supply fixed flow rate. It can be seen for this particular servodrive that the  
drive efficiency is a maximum for a reasonably-constant pressure differential across the servovalve of  
(3V – 3) ≈ 15bar for most of its operating voltage range. 
The appropriate conditions are therefore:
Optimum drive efficiency (3V–3) = 15bar 
Supply pressure PRV 3V = -4 +12.59S bar
Combining these two equations gives 9S = 1.52 +0.083
Applying both servovalve flow rate linearisation and supply pressure adaption then results in the motor 
speed and drive efficiency characteristics shown as figure 3.12 for a nominal motor speed of 515rpm at 
minimum load pressure differential.

Figure 3.12 Motor open-loop servodrive speed and drive efficiency characteristics for a nominal motor speed of 53.94rad/s (515rpm) 
[Davies RM and Watton J. Intelligent Control of an Electrohydraulic Motor Drive System. Journal of Mechatronics, Vol 5, No 5, 1995, 
527–540]
The efficiency is generally low because the supply pump flow is high and fixed. However, the principle of 
the approach is demonstrated. A more advanced approach would also include supply flow rate adaption 
but within fixed limits. It can be seen from figure 3.12 that:
•	 flow rate linearisation has a significant effect on motor speed over the range of operation 
and on drive efficiency for higher load pressure differentials
•	 the addition of pressure adaption has no effect on motor speed, as preferred
•	 the addition of pressure adaption does improve the drive efficiency as designed
The negative aspects of this approach to performance improvement are:
•	 the use of a PRV for both supply pressure control and servovalve linearisation has added 
more system dynamics which have not been presented here. In other words, the dynamic 
behaviour deteriorates 
•	 servovalve linearisation has significantly reduced system damping by the serrvovalve, which 
has not been addressed at this stage. Damping may be improved using the PSC to generate 
dynamic pressure feedback, as will be discussed in Chapter 7

Aim
The aim of this chapter is to introduce more realistic system models by adding dynamic effects, together 
with losses, and via the following objectives:
•	 to introduce the interaction between fluid compressibility and moving mass/inertia
•	 to show how to calculate the actuator/load fundamental resonant frequency
•	 to introduce the linearisation method to give a feel for the probable dynamic behaviour
•	 to introduce the role of computer simulation using Matlab Simulink
•	 to illustrate the performance of servodrives using worked examples
4.2	
Fluid compressibility and its effect on flow rate
In reality a fluid power system has moving mass and the combination of this with fluid compressibility 
results in system dynamics that usually cannot be neglected. Also a servovalve spool cannot move 
immediately to its commanded position and it therefore contributes to dynamic behaviour. Whether 
or not the servovalve dynamics should be included depends usually on the magnitude of the moving 
mass for a linear actuator or the rotary inertia for a motor combined with actuator size. In practice 
damping is fortuitously provided by losses due to viscous and leakage effects but a closed-loop control 
system will almost certainly become unstable as the servoamplifier gain is increased due to dynamic 
effects. Instability can lead to disastrous consequences if severe pressure oscillations occur, for example 
in motor servodrives.
Consider first the effect of fluid compressibility for an arbitrary control volume which has a flow rate 
4L into it and a flow rate 4R out of it as shown in figure 4.1.

The fluid bulk modulus is β and varies with pressure, temperature, and fluid type and it is very important 
to refer to manufacturers data sheets when considering fluid properties. Most of the author’s work with 
mineral oil uses ISO 32 mineral oil, that is, a mineral oil with a viscosity of 32cSt at a temperature of 400C 
(1centiStoke =PV). At typical servodrive pressures around 100→240bar the fluid bulk modulus is  
β ≈ [1P. Considering a very small inherent air content in practice reduces this value to typically 
β ≈ [1P. 
If flexible hose is used then the effective bulk modulus of the fluid/hose combination is drastically 
reduced. Measurements by the author has indicated a value typically half that for a rigid steel line of 
the same length.

Returning to equation (4.1), the difference between the input flow rate 4L and the output flow rate 4R is 
equal to the rate of change of the boundary volume plus an additional flow rate due to fluid compressibility. 
It is crucial to appreciate here that the dynamic fluid compressibility effect can only occur if pressure is 
varying with time. For steady state conditions the compressibility flow rate term is zero but there could 
still be a moving boundary such as a piston moving with a constant velocity. Considering the actuators 
shown in figure 4.2 the flow rate continuity equation may be applied to the appropriate control volume:

9 and 9 are the total fluid volumes on either side of the actuator. Volumes are a combination of line 
and actuator volumes, the latter also varying with time for a linear actuator during motion. Usually 
pressure transients occur very rapidly and within a small movement for a linear actuator. For this reason, 
particularly when using transfer functions as introduced in Chapter 5, it is common to assume a constant 
actuator volume on either side and at the particular steady-state condition selected.

Undamped natural frequency of an actuator
The natural frequency is not affected by the input, load conditions and losses and therefore equations (4.3) 
and (4.5) may be combined and letting 4 4 = F = T = 0. Servovalve dynamics are neglected since they 
are very weakly connected to the actuator by flow reaction forces that are not discussed here. Considering 
a linear actuator, since the motor equivalent may be derived from this, then gives the servodrive speed 
differential equation by combining equations (4.3) and (4.5) as follows:

Some interesting points arise by considering the undamped natural frequency equation:
•	 for a double-rod linear actuator $ $ = $. If the volumes are dominated by the actuator 
only, that is line volumes are negligible, then it is a simple matter to show that the minimum 
undamped natural frequency occurs with the actuator in its mid-position with 9 = 9 = 9. 
This frequency is given by:

•	 for a single rod actuator where $ ≠ $, and again if line volumes are negligible, it can also 
be shown that the minimum undamped natural frequency occurs very close to the central 
position, even for area ratios up to Ȗ $$ 
•	 a high undamped natural frequency requires a low mass and/or a high stiffness. The latter may 
be achieved using a large cross-sectional-area and small volumes
It is possible that steel pipes may contribute to the effective bulk modulus. The pipe material bulk 
modulus ȕS may be determined from the theory of elasticity assuming a pipe of internal diameter

Actuator equations with losses and dynamics
The steady-state losses were discussed in Chapter 3 where it will be recalled that the main contribution 
to system damping are:
•	 leakages at the actuator
•	 viscous resistance due to actuator motion within the working fluid
•	 actuator and load stiction/Coulomb friction
•	 fluid friction due to long connecting lines in some applications
Considering now linear and rotary actuators shown in figure 4.4 with load mass M and rotary inertia J 
and losses. The flow continuity equations (4.3) are again stated and include leakage and compressibility

It will be recalled that Ri is the leakage series resistance across the linear actuator piston, Ri and Re are 
the motor internal and external resistances due to cross-port and other leakages. A correctly functioning 
linear actuator has no significant external leakage from the rod seals but a motor does have external 
leakage via the case drain connection to tank.

To get a reasonable initial feel for the probable system dynamic equations the mean flow rate may be 
used. Also, it may be assumed that for most applications that the volumes on either side are equal. This 
is probably correct for a motor and a reasonable approximation for a linear actuator, particularly with a 
double rod. Hence the dynamic flow continuity equations may be written as follows:

Viscous friction loss = %Y8RU%YȦ
where %Y is the viscous damping coefficient. The other friction losses are due to the stiction/friction 
characteristic of the actuator, also discussed in Chapter 3. A single stiction/Coulomb friction value,

Linearisation of the system equations
An understanding of system dynamics can be achieved by the use of transfer functions, discussed later, 
which for a set of non-linear equations requires that all the equations must be linearised. This means 
that the analysis applies to small dynamic variations about a particular operating point. Consider a 
general second-order linear differential equation and linearise about an operating condition \R<R

Often the δ notation is dropped for convenience so that δ3 is simply written as 3 etc. However, it 
should be made clear in any analysis that a linearised approach is being used. 
Note that the linearised steady-state relationship between actuator speed and current is exactly the same 
as the true relationship. This is another reason why a linearised approximation to system dynamics is 
useful as a good starting point in understanding both steady-state and dynamic behaviour of servodrives.

Pipe resistance, compressibility and inertia
Pipe friction losses can be extremely significant in large diameter/high flow rate systems such as steel 
processing operations where the power supply has to be remote from the actuators due to both noise 
and safety considerations. In such applications the power loss can be extremely high and cannot be 
overcome. For most conventional applications pipe friction is often negligible and clearly so when the 
servovalve is mounted on the actuator. However, each application must be assessed on its own merits. 
The pressure drop Δp down a smooth pipe is calculated using the following well-established equation:

where 4f is known as the friction factor, 8PHDQ is the fluid mean velocity, ȡ is the fluid density, " is the 
pipe length and d is the pipe diameter. The friction factor may be calculated by determining the type 
of flow regime, laminar flow or turbulent flow. These regimes are calculated, for a smooth pipe, by first 
determining the Reynolds Number:

where μ is the fluid absolute viscosity. Note that fluid density varies slightly with temperature and pressure

The flow regime around Re = 2000 is actually quite complex and the transition zone from laminar to 
turbulent flow is not quite matched at Re = 2000. However this fluid mechanics detail is not too important 
for servodrive applications where the flow is usually well defined as either laminar for low-power 
applications or turbulent for high-power applications. For turbulent flow conditions a linear resistance 
is not applicable but the use of a non-linear resistance is easy to implement if computer simulation is 
used. For large flow, large diameter and long pipe applications, such as forging presses, the use of a 
laminar flow resistance rather than a turbulent flow resistance can give serious errors in system damping
Example 4.4
Consider a forging press as shown below and similar in concept to two industrial systems analysed by 
the author for the manufacturer.

The total power loss is extremely large and explains why large-force forging presses require a substantial 
electrical power supply to drive the array of pumps to overcome friction losses and provide the high 
flow rate at the high pressure required during operation.

Fluid compressibility for a pipe has already been dealt with since it is no different to that defined earlier 
for a general fluid volume. However the problem is how the compressibility is handled if it is significant 
for a long line and this will be considered after fluid inertia has been discussed. Fluid inductance for a 
pipe is defined as follows:

Now having defined fluid resistance, capacitance and inductance the important question is how are 
these fluid properties distributed along a line? The true answer is that a distributed parameter analysis 
applies and there are well-established ways of modelling a line using this approach. For the present study, 
given the context of this book, just one of several approximations is used, sometimes called a lumped 
approximation, and actually can be a good representation of a line as a first-estimate. A common lumped 
approximation is a π network as shown in figure 4.5.

 Figure 4.5 A π network approximation for a line
In this approximating network half the line capacitance is lumped at each end with the total resistance 
and total inductance being lumped in series in the middle. Two networks may be connected with each 
R, L, C elements halved for each network. This aspect of line modelling will be pursued later when a 
servodrive undamped natural frequency is considered.

Servovodrive open-loop linearised differential equation with losses 
and dynamics
Bringing together flow rate equations (4.19) and load equations (4.21) then allows the equations relating 
speed and input current to be established. For a linear actuator a double-rod will be used such that  
$ $ = A and only the dynamic terms will be included since constant terms such as load force/
torque and friction do not influence the dynamic behaviour. It will also be assumed that the volumes 
on either side of the actuator are equal 9 = 9 = 9. Therefore with no line dynamics the open-loop 
system linearised equations of motion become:

The damping ratio is equally important as the undamped natural frequency since it determines whether 
or not the system response is oscillatory as follows:
under-damped (oscillatory) ȗ < 1
critically-damped ȗ = 1
over-damped ȗ > 1
In practice a good design would achieve a damping ratio 0.7 < ȗ < 1. If a response is oscillatory then

For very small servovalve currents and hence low speeds under open-loop control, and certainly under 
closed-loop position control, the servovalve resistance 5VY is extremely high and will contribute little 
damping. Inherent damping is then provided by actuator resistance 5DFW. From the author’s experience, 
two power regimes of control may be considered.

•	 low-power servodrives will have small-diameter actuators and hence a relatively high 
undamped natural frequency which is desirable 
•	 high-power servodrives will have large-diameter actuators and hence will tend to provide 
actuator damping albeit with a low undamped natural frequency
•	 this may well explain, to some extent, why servodrive dynamics in practice do not seem to 
present major control issues
4.9	
Servovalve dynamics
Clearly the sudden application of a current to a servovalve will not result in the spool moving 
instantaneously to its commanded position. Servovalve dynamics originate from the electromagnetic 
circuit of the torque motor, fluid dynamics within the hydraulic first stage, viscous and inertia effects due 
to the spool. These effects have been studied over many years but the applicability of a general theory to 
the many servovalve designs available is not possible or even fruitful in the context of this book. 
A second-order spool dynamics characteristic is often used but a higher-order approximation may be 
used if necessary. Considering a second order differential equation for servovalve spool motion then the 
undamped natural frequency ȦQVY and damping ratio ȗVY may be estimated from the manufacturer’s 
data or from measurements by the user. Hence recalling definitions in Chapter 2, the dynamic flow rate 
for a particular port may be determined by including a spool dynamics function f as follows:

It should also be realised that the damping ratio will vary greatly with servovalve type and also the 
magnitude of the current applied to the servovalve. For larger current changes the damping tends to 
increase and this variation may readily be assessed from the manufacturer’s data where the effect is usually 
presented. In practical work by the author, the manufacturer’s data for a common industrial servovalve 
showed an undamped natural frequency ȦQVY = 140Hz and a damping ratio ȗVY = 1, and averaged over 
a wide range of servovalve currents. Very-high response servovalves are available but the performance 
does depend upon the servovalve type, design and rated flow.

A linearised analysis assumes steady-state conditions in which case the acceleration is zero. For this

A linearised transient analysis strictly speaking only applies for small variations about the steady-state 
condition. However a linearised analysis is usually extrapolated to the large-signal response, in this case 
from zero velocity to its steady-state velocity. The following points arise from this example:
•	 the steady-state velocity is correctly predicted by the linearised equation of motion
•	 it can be seen that the linearised solution has a lower predicted damping which is usually 
the case for a second-order servodrive system and is a good, fortuitous, design feature
•	 a linearised approach based upon steady-state conditions can give a good feel for the 
transient response that might be expected

The role of computer simulation
In many cases, with easily-defined hydraulic elements and loads, it may only be necessary to use a 
linearised approach and the assessment of dynamic behaviour is then not too difficult, as will be seen 
later. However the reality of more complex processes means that non-linear computer simulation is 
essential. It is now commonplace that a simulation model incorporating the non-linear equations and 
higher-order dynamics is used to assess the most probable system behaviour, particularly for complex 
processes such as metal working or aerospace applications.
Hydraulic systems users are demanding that the control promise of the system manufacturer can be 
met and the only way this can be done is by computer simulation if a similar system has not previously 
been built. It therefore makes sense for the system manufacturer to build up good system sub-models 
along the way such that future contracts can be more readily assessed. In the author’s experience of 
modelling the dynamic behaviour of high-power manufacturing processes prior to manufacture, the 
issues of concern have been:
•	 determination of actuator damping and leakage, particularly for very large diameter actuators
•	 joint friction in large structures
•	 suitable, useable, pipeline models for larger diameter pipes with turbulent flow
•	 dynamic models for very high flow rate flow control valves and pressure relief valves
For modest power applications component testing can be undertaken in the fluid power laboratory and/
or data can be supplied by the manufacturer. Whatever the approach, an agreement has to be reached 
between the manufacture and the system analyst regarding any possible limitations of a computer 
simulation and its predictions. 
There are many simulation packages used by different fluid power groups, some of them developed 
in-house, but in this book Matlab software is used, the Control System Toolbox for linear systems and 
Simulink for non-linear systems. A servoactuator and control system is built using the software library 
but the final model does not look like a fluid power circuit. Appropriate mathematical functions are 
dragged onto the computer screen from the Library using the mouse, the function placed wherever 
appropriate in the block diagram and then connected. The package is easy to work with, extremely 
flexible and allows a library of hydraulic and control sub-models to be developed that may then be easily 
integrated into new control systems.

Building the Matlab Simulink model is relatively straightforward, each differential equation being re-
arranged such that the highest differential term is placed on the left hand side. For the system being 
considered here this means that d3/dt, d3/dt, dU/dt and GIGW are then created allowing them 
to be integrated to produce 3, 3, U, df/dt and f which are then used to complete each appropriate 
block diagram.
From the modelling experience of the author, the following points may be useful for the beginner:
•	 limit appropriate parameters to their practical values such as servovalve current and actuator 
maximum stroke in each direction from the initial condition
•	 do not allow negative pressures following integration. This is a simplified approach, rarely 
needed, but does avoid simulation failure by trying to calculate the square root of a negative 
number in some operational conditions
•	 select a relative tolerance of  and use the ode23 [bogacki-Shampine] solver as a starting point
•	 do not include closed-loops that are algebraic only

•	 create sub-models for self-contained elements of the simulation to both simplify the screen 
layout and to allow transfer of standard sub-models to other simulations. Annotate each sub-
model as much as possible to aid later understanding
•	 try and make sub-models as general as possible, for example include both actuator areas $ 
and $ as separate input parameters. They may be made equal for a double-rod actuator
•	 use scopes to view the simulation results and save data to Workspace using the Array format. 
Include a clock to Workspace so that the simulation time is available for the plotting requirement
•	 use the Simulink command window to plot the results, for example plotW\ will plot the 
computed position y against time t which may be annotated using the graphics routines within 
this facility. If the symbols P1 and P2 for pressures are used in the simulation, then to plot the 
pressures use plot(t,P1,t,P2)
•	 note that later versions of the software not used by the author may well have significant updates

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our

An integrator has the symbol 1/s, where s is the Laplace operator that is discussed further in  
Chapter 5. Saturation blocks are used to select port flow direction and maintain the correct notation 
for each pressure, although in this example for the actuator extending case only the servovalve current 
does not change sign. The range of each saturation blocks is set to ĺNILPD[ and NILPD[ĺ. 
The sub-models for obtaining the load position y and the two pressures 3 and 3 are built in a similar 
way, the only significant addition being that the mathematical function ,1/u, is required to determine 
the inverse of the time varying volumes either side of the actuator. Note the output limitations on 
each integrator to determine pressures. The static pressures 3 = 90bar and 3 = 50bar are used as 
initial conditions.

The time to run this basic simulation is difficult to assess since it is completed almost as soon as the 
mouse click, to initiate execution, has been released. It is therefore a very fast and efficient approach that 
allows system changes to be easily made and their effects observed. 
Results are now shown using Example 4.5 data and for servovalve currents of 2mA and 20mA. The latter 
was shown in Example 4.5 together with the prediction using a linearised transfer function.

Syste m dynami cs and comp uter simulatio
At high steady-state flow rates the servovalve resistance is finite and dominant but as the flow rate 
approaches zero then the servovalve resistance approaches infinity and damping is then dominated by 
leakage and viscous friction effectively producing low effective damping. 
Over the range of operation one of the pressures may transiently approach zero, implying undesirable 
cavitation in practice. This is a common dichotomy in open-loop electrohydraulic servodrives:
•	 small signals may produce large fluctuations in velocity but small fluctuations in pressures
•	 larger signals produce less oscillations in velocity yet higher fluctuations in pressures

The use of Matlab Control System Toolbox is valuable for the analysis of linear systems and may easily be 
used to determine both transient response and frequency response, the latter being extremely useful for 
understanding the effect of control techniques and the conditions for closed-loop instability. The use of 
this Toolbox will be demonstrated later following the introduction of block diagrams for linear systems.

Aim
The aim of this chapter is to show how a fluid power circuit can be analysed in a way that is common 
within the fluid power industry and via objectives as follows:
•	 to introduce Laplace transforms for linear, or linearised, system equations and to use the 
method to generate transfer functions and block diagrams
•	 to develop common block diagrams for servovdrives
•	 to use a transfer function approach to get a preliminary feel for natural frequency with 
significant connecting lines
•	 to compare the relationship between transient response and frequency response and to 
introduce the use of Matlab Control System Toolbox
•	 to demonstrate the use of transfer functions and block diagrams via worked examples
5.2	
Laplace transforms
Differential equations that describe system dynamics are not in a form often used by fluid power 
control engineers, unless computer simulation is to be undertaken. Block diagrams are a useful way of 
representing a control system and Laplace transforms are merely a way of changing linear differential 
equations into algebraic equations to facilitate this process. For the purpose of this book Laplace 
transforms are used in their simplest form, notwithstanding the powerful mathematical process of the 
technique used in many aspects of control theory. The process of Laplace transformation of all elements 
of a linear differential equations changes it to an algebraic equation and operates on time domain 
functions as follows:
Laplace transform of a function /IW )V 

IWH

where IW is the time varying function and s is the Laplace operator. Some common Laplace transforms 
are shown in Table 1. Consider first an arbitrary differential equation for position control relating output

To solve this differential equation then transform each element using the appropriate Laplace transforms 
from Table 1. Also for the complete solution any initial conditions, \(o) and d\(o)/dt will have to be 
specified. The (s) notation is used to signify Laplace transformation as follows:

Transfer functions and block diagrams
The concept of a transfer function may now be introduced. A transfer function relates “output” to “input”. 
For example, neglecting the initial condition, then from (5.5) the transfer function relating position y(s)
to demanded position yd(s) becomes:

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams,

A transfer function may then be represented by a block diagram and this is of great value when describing 
a control system. For example a simple block diagram for (5.6) may be constructed as shown in figure 5.1.

It should now be noticed that time differential terms in a differential equation are simply transformed into 
algebraic terms, when initial conditions are neglected, with a suitable power of the Laplace operator s. 
The transformations are as follows:

It is important to realise at this stage that the nature of the transient response and the stability of a linear 
closed-loop system do not depend upon initial conditions and load conditions. For this reason transfer 
functions such as that shown as figure 5.1 tend not to include initial condition terms when analysing 
control systems response and stability.
Now consider a closed-loop position control system as shown in figure 5.2, in this case for a servodrive 
with a double-rod linear actuator, and with losses and significant dynamics. Servovalve dynamics are 
neglected here, that is they are much faster than the system dynamics.

The undamped natural frequency is ȦQ and ȗ is the damping ratio. Recalling the process of integration 
to obtain position from velocity, using its Laplace transform, then results in the closed-loop block 
diagram shown as figure 5.3. The feedback signal is obtained from a position sensor, gain +S V/m, and 
the closed-loop system must have negative feedback to function in a stable manner.

 Figure 5.3 Block diagram for a servodrive position control system
The blocks in the forward loop are usually combined into a common block called the forward gain G(s). 
In control theory any feedback block, or product of blocks, is referred to as the feedback gain H(s). The 
open-loop transfer function (OLTF) is the product G(s)H(s). 
This very basic introduction to block diagram representation should indicate the simplicity of adding 
extra dynamics. For example if it is necessary to include servovalve dynamics, then from Chapter 4 
the 2nd order differential equation approximation results in a 2nd order transfer function which is then 
simply added into the forward loop as shown in figure 5.4.

 Figure 5.4 Block diagram for a servodrive position control system with servovalve dynamics included
Now the closed-loop dynamics are 5th order, the highest power of s in the denominator of the OLTF, and 
the dynamic behaviour can really only be assessed via computer analysis or simulation, a straightforward 
process given the various simulation packages commercially available. If computer simulation is used 
then it makes sense to model the correct servovalve non-linear flow characteristic.
The servovalve transfer function is known as type 0 since it has no free integrator term in the denominator, 
the servodrive transfer function is known as type 1 due to the single integrator, the combined servovalve 
and servodrive transfer function therefore also being type 1.

Undamped natural frequency with connecting line effects
An initial estimate on whether or not line dynamics are significant may be made by comparing line and 
load inductances. From Chapter 4 it was stated that:

If the two values are similar then line dynamics will probably have to be included. An additional aid is 
to determine the line fundamental frequency by considering the time for a wave travelling at the speed 
of sound to travel along the line. This pure delay is given by:

Assuming typical values of β § 1.4×109 Nm-2/m3s-1 and ρ § 860 kg/m3 for a mineral oil then the

This gives a line frequency of 638Hz/m, 319Hz/2m etc which may be compared with the actuator 
undamped natural frequency already discussed. 
The influence of the connecting lines between the servovalve and actuator can easily be deduced using 
Laplace transforms but is restricted here to a double-rod actuator. Consider figure 5.5 and a first-estimate 
of line dynamics using a simple approximation.

 Figure 5.5 Electrical analogy for actuator and lines with losses neglected
The model is built up as follows:
•	 to determine the system undamped natural frequency then losses do not need to be included. 
Hence compressibility and inertia terms only are needed to construct the circuit representation 
shown as figure 5.5
•	 a single π lump approximation has been used for each line as a first-estimate, and is just one 
of many approximations that may be used. Half the line total compressibility effect, C/2, has 
been placed at each line end with each line total inductance L placed between them
•	 it will be noticed that the actuator compressibility effects & and & have to be added with 
each line C/2 where appropriate at two circuit points
•	 the load inductance due to moving mass is given by /D. Assume equal volumes on either side 
of the actuator, & & &DFW

The roots of the denominator of (5.14) give an approximation to the two coupled undamped natural 
frequencies, one representative of line dynamics and the other representative of actuator dynamics. 
These two frequencies are easily determined by the solution of two quadratic equations by letting V   MȦ
and then equating the denominator of (5.14) to zero. Two useful solutions are readily obtained for the 
uncoupled cases as follows:
i) If the actuator dynamics are negligible, /D &DFW  then:

Hence the undamped natural frequency is due to the lines alone. The undamped natural frequency is

It can be seen that equation (5.16) has a numerical factor of 1.41 whereas equation (5.17) has a numerical 
factor of 1.57. For servodrives that have lines that create little damping then the lumped parameter 
approximation gives an estimate of the undamped natural frequency similar to that estimated using 
wave transmission theory. These two similar solutions are sufficient to give a “feel” for the magnitude 
of expected line dynamic effects.

Example 5.1
Consider a real example, studied by the author, of a servovalve connected to the actuator by a pair of 
similar lines, each line being a combination of steel pipe and flexible hose. This is typical of what happens 
in practice where a short hose is often used to minimise vibration coupling between components and 
with a steel pipe to minimise air-borne noise.

The actuator is horizontal, with no load force F and is not connected to its load mechanism, hence having 
its minimum mass m. The cylinder is a high quality product designed for precision control applications 
and having low friction seals. Consequently the stiction/friction force was found to be negligible.

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
The roots of this transfer function 4th order denominator are determined to be:
288Hz, the effect of actuator 
140Hz, the effect of the lines
Hence it is concluded at this stage that the transient response is dominated by line dynamics rather 
than by actuator dynamics.
Computer simulation of the system equations
The servovalve dynamic response is represented by the manufacturer’s recommended second-order 
transfer function with an undamped natural frequency ZQV +] and a damping ratio ]V = 1. Note 
that this has no effect on the system natural frequency. Each line resistance is as follows:

line-dominated undamped natural frequency is 140Hz
actuator-dominated undamped natural frequency is 288Hz
The main conclusions from this example are:
•	 the simulation transient response prediction is good given that only a single π lump 
approximation is used for each line
•	 the simulation prediction for the damped frequency is 127Hz and close to the measured value 
of 120Hz. The transfer function coupled prediction for the undamped natural frequency is 
140Hz and therefore higher than the damped frequency
•	 the transfer function two uncoupled solutions indicate that line dynamics dominate although 
the actuator effect can just be seen at the initial part of the measured transient response

Transient response and its specification
Having now considered transfer functions and block diagrams, the response of open-loop and closed-
loop systems may be pursued further in the time domain and in the frequency domain. The time 
response of a 1st order system, following a sudden demand to change its “output”, experiences a system 
output that increases in an exponential manner with increasing time. Considering figure 5.6 and a step 
input of magnitude yd then the time response is readily deduced form the Laplace transform Table1and 
is as shown. 
yd(s)                                  y(s)          y = yd[ 1 – e-t/τ ]

 Figure 5.6 Transfer function of a 1st order system
The time response solution for a 2nd order system is a little more complicated because it depends upon 
the damping ratio ȗ of the system. Consider a second-order transfer function shown in figure 5.7. 
yd(s)                                             y(s)

The time response solution for a 3rd order system is further complicated because of the different forms 
that the denominator can take as dictated by its three roots. The denominator of the transfer function 
can be a combination of three 1st order terms or a combination of one 1st order term together with a 
2nd order term. Consider the 3rd order transfer function, figure 5.9, with the denominator written in 
the specific form shown:

 Figure 5.9 Transfer function of a 3rd order system
One way of designing a 3rd order system is to consider the response to a step input and use the Integral 
of Time multiplied by Absolute Error criterion, the ITAE criterion. The ITAE value from W WRW 
is then minimised as the parameters a and b are varied. This results in values of a = 2.15 and b = 1.75.
The resulting response to a step input demand is shown as figure 5.10.

Figure 5.10 Transient response to a step input for a 3rd order transfer function satisfying the ITAE criterion
The result of the ITAE third-order criterion is actually to simplify the 3rd order transfer function into:
a 1st order transfer function with a time constant of τ = 1.41/ȦR
a 2nd order transfer function with ȦQ ȦR and ȗ = 0.31
In practice it may not be possible to achieve the 3rd order criterion since it places restraints on system 
parameters that may not be possible to change to achieve the desired solution. 
When specifying a desired transient performance in practice the realities of hydraulic and measurement 
noise together with friction and servovalve static and dynamic behaviour means that idealised transfer 
functions do not quite hold but are often a very good estimate of probable performance. A servodrive 
user will specify preferred characteristics as shown schematically in figure 5.11.

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams,

A design will probably require a number of performance parameters to be achieved such as:
•	 maximum overshoot
•	 maximum ramp rate
•	 peak-to-peak variation and steady-state error
•	 rise time interval to achieve a specific output
•	 settling time to achieve a specific output value
Example 5.2
Determine the linearised open-loop transfer function for a motor servodrive given the following 
system data:
Supply pressure = 210bar
Load pressure @ 240rpm = 120bar
Displacement 'P 12×10-6 m3/rad 
motor and load inertia J = 0.5kg m2
Volume either side = 2×10-4 m3
Ma×imum steady-state motor speed = 240rpm
Viscous coefficient %Y = 0.04Nm/rad s-1
Motor flow losses are negligible
Fluid bulk modulus ȕ = 1.4×109 N/m2

The undamped natural frequency ȦQ= 63.5rad/s (10.1Hz) and the damping ratio ȗ=1.87 and therefore 
the response is over-damped. Hence the motor transient speed will not overshoot and therefore not 
exceed the steady-state speed demanded. The steady-state motor speed is 240rpm @ i =17.9mA. 
If an improved transient response is desired then a change in motor displacement could be considered 
but the load pressure will have to be re-calculated and the supply pressure re-assessed.

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
5.6	
Frequency response
Now consider the frequency response technique for characterising and designing servodrives. A transient 
response test is easier to undertake than a frequency response test but the former gives little information 
on the dynamic structure of the component or system being analysed. For example a transient response 
test might show overshoot of the parameter being measured but is the dynamic structure 2nd order, 3rd 
order, etc.? A frequency response test can provide this information providing the test can be carried out 
up to a sufficiently-high frequency to embrace the dynamic structure.
The frequency response method of analysing the system considers the steady-state condition with a 
sinusoidal excitation of fixed amplitude and a varying frequency applied to the input. Consider figure 5.12, 
an open-loop position control system, to determine the dynamics of the servovalve and actuator. A 
sinusoidal voltage of appropriate amplitude is applied and initially the output position will fluctuate and 
then settle down also to a steady-state sine wave for a linear system, or a close representation of a sine 
wave for a non-linear system, but with a phase difference compared with the input. The phase difference 
and amplitude of the output will change as the input frequency changes.

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
Note that when attempting this experimentally two important issues arise:
•	 for an open-loop servodrive the actuator will drift for a single-rod actuator due to different 
speeds when extending and retracting in the open-loop mode; this drift will also inevitably occur 
for a double-rod actuator. In practice therefore it will be necessary to add a small bias voltage 
to the input sinusoid to correct for drift and maintain the actuator in the desired mean position
•	 as the frequency is increased then the output position voltage amplitude will eventually reduce 
and will become impossible to determine due to both its low magnitude and superimposed 
hydraulic and sensor noise. 
It can be shown using Laplace transform theory that for steady-state conditions the amplitude ratio and 
the phase angle of the transfer function, as indicated in figure 5.12, are given by:

Phase angle f = tan-1B/A
Frequency response is usually shown with frequency plotted on a logarithmic scale. Two parts are used, 
one for magnitude ratio/frequency and the other for phase angle/frequency. The amplitude ratio is 
converted to decibels (dB) as follows:

Such a logarithmic representation of magnitude ratio is often referred to as a Bode diagram, although 
strictly speaking a Bode diagram is a collection of straight line approximations to the actual magnitude ratio. 
When the magnitude is considered it will be evident that common transfer functions will have asymptotic 
approximations over some parts of the frequency range and this can help in deciding the probable form 
of a transfer function when experimentally measured. Note also that a product of transfer functions 
become additive when a frequency response is considered on a logarithmic basis.

 Figure 5.14 Frequency response for a 1st order transfer function, K = 1
Some observations may be made:
•	 the break frequency is defined when ȦĲ  and when Ȧ Ĳ the phase angle I R
•	 as the frequency becomes large the phase angle IĺR
•	 drawing a straight line from 0dB magnitude at the break frequency, ȦĲ  and at a slope 
of -20dB/decade becomes asymptotic to the exact magnitude ratio at higher frequencies. 
This is the Bode approximation
•	 at the break frequency, ȦĲ  the exact magnitude ratio is 3dB down from the Bode 
approximation. In other words where the measured magnitude ratio drops 3dB from the 
low-frequency constant magnitude ratio gives the system break frequency. Hence Ĳ Ȧ
This information may be used to identify a 1st order transfer function from practical data, should the 
plot suggest a 1st order transfer function.

 Figure 5.15 Frequency response for a 2nd order transfer function

It should be realised that there is a pattern to the overall “shape” of a frequency response plot and some 
general points may be made as follows:
•	 the order, n, of a transfer function denominator indicates the asymptotic phase angle which 
is (n)×(-90o). The order of a transfer function numerator, m, indicates the asymptotic phase 
angle which is (m)×(+90o). The net asymptotic phase angle is the addition of the two
•	 the high-frequency slope of the magnitude ratio plot is (n-m)×(-20) dB/decade

•	 each free s term in the denominator has a phase angle of -90o and a slope of -20dB/decade
•	 each free s term in the numerator has a phase angle of +90o and a slope of +20dB/decade
•	 the low frequency asymptote can give information on the transfer function gain
For example, consider the following transfer function:

•	 the asymptotic magnitude ratio slope at low frequency is -20dB/decade due to the dominant 
integrator 
•	 the asymptotic magnitude ratio slope at high frequency approaches -60dB/decade for the 
denominator and +20dB/decade for the numerator giving a net value of -40dB/decade 
•	 the phase angle has a low frequency value of -90o due to the integrator
•	 as the frequency increases then the phase contribution from the denominator approaches 
-270o and the phase contribution from the numerator approaches +90o resulting in a net 
phase angle of -180o
This type of information greatly assists identification of the dynamic shape of a servovalve or servodrive 
transfer function. When the transfer function is not known with any satisfaction then the deduction 
of terms such as those in (5.32) is difficult to assess from experimental data. However, there are 
commercial identification software packages available that can be used to best match data with a chosen 
transfer function. 
Example 5.3
A measured transfer function plot for a servovalve is shown and is just one of many depending on the 
servovalve type and rating selected. Determine a possible transfer function.

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
It can be seen that the data is applicable up to a frequency of about 500Hz, a high value and most probably 
beyond many industrial servodrive frequencies. Notice that the plot changes with input signal amplitude. 
The magnitude plot shows a high-frequency slope of typically -20dB/decade and indicative of a 1st order 
transfer function. However, the phase angle is moving beyond -180o indicating at least a 2nd order or 
possibly a 3rd order transfer function; the servovalve dynamic response is certainly very fast. 
Assuming a 2nd order transfer function approximation as a starting point and considering the average 
of the two sets of data then:
•	 the phase angle is -90o at a frequency of about 190Hz and this is the undamped natural 
frequency ȦQ
•	 at the undamped natural frequency the magnitude ratio is about -4.2dB → 1/2ȗ. Hence the 
damping ratio ȗ§ This suggests under-damping since ȗ < 1 
•	 however, the servovalve is possibly overdamped as is evident from the magnitude ratio plot 
so increase the damping ratio to ȗ = 1
The 2nd order approximation is therefore:

This pragmatic approach gives an approximation that is good for a first estimate and further analysis 
might consider different transfer function forms, for example a combination of a 1st order term and a 
2nd order term. 
If the Matlab Control System Toolbox is available then both the transient response and the frequency 
response of the assumed transfer function may be evaluated as follows:

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
The measured open-loop frequency response plot for position is now shown and demonstrates how typical 
data will “run-away” at higher frequencies due to both hydraulic and signal noise signal resolution and 
the effect of the integrator attenuation effect. The frequency response test is carried out at the actuator 
central position which is maintained during the open-loop test using a bias current that has to be 
continually adjusted as the actuator tends to drift during this type of test.

The servovalve resistance 5VY  for a critically-lapped spool, but only at its true zero position. Since 
a finite amplitude of oscillation in current has to be used when testing then an average finite resistance

this example it will be assumed that damping is dominated by viscous friction, 5  and the OLTF

Now consider the measured data.
•	 as expected the measured transfer function has a low-frequency magnitude having a 
slope of -20dB/decade and a constant phase angle of -900 due to the integrator term for 
position measurement
•	 the 2nd order contribution is evident but appears to be very lightly damped. This means that 
the peak magnitude occurs at a frequency close to its undamped natural frequency. From the 
magnitude plot:

It must be stated that these calculations are subject to error since it is difficult to experimentally determine 
the peak magnitude conditions accurately at the undamped natural frequency for a very lightly damped 
2nd order transfer function. 
Now consider validating the assumed transfer function model.

The effect of a pure delay
Sometimes it is found in published work that a servoactuator transfer function includes a pure delay 
term. The reason for a significant pure delay is not always justifiable and is often attributed to:
•	 an electromagnetic effect when building up the servovalve coil current
•	 the building up of pressure differential across the servovalve spool to overcome the small 
amount of spool friction
•	 additional higher-order fluid and mechanical dynamic effects within the servovalve not 
discussed in this book
•	 The servoactuator may have a line effect
These effects may be significant for multi-stage servovalves and the user must make an assessment in 
conjunction with manufacturers’ data. In terms of transfer function analysis, a pure delay is represented 
by its Laplace transform as follows: 
Pure delay transfer function *V HV7 ĺ*MȦ HMȦ7
The magnitude ratio and phase angle are given by:
| G(jω) | =1       phase angle ϕ = -ωT
The effect of a pure delay is therefore to give an increasing phase lag with increasing frequency and is 
therefore de-stabilising. For computer simulation, for example using Matlab Simulink, a pure delay may 
be used in its exact form given by equation (5.33). However, in some published work using transfer 
function analysis, particularly for practical identifications, then linear approximations to equation (5.33) 
have been used. For example, one approximation is the bilinear approximation using the linear terms of 
the Taylor series expansion which gives:

Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, 
transient and frequency response
If a computer package is used to identify a transfer function such as (5.36) using experimental data then 
the computed value of T may be different to the expected value of T. Also, if the 2nd order denominator 
term in (5.36) is changed, for example to 3rd order, then the computed value of T may also change. In 
other words, the identification approach computes the best coefficients to match the transfer function 
specified without any consideration of the physical reality.

Aim
To understand the dynamic stability of closed-loop systems via the following objectives:
•	 to become further familiar with closed-loop block diagram terminology
•	 to determine the conditions for closed-loop stability 
•	 to become familiar with frequency response techniques
•	 to demonstrate concepts via worked examples
6.2	
Closed-loop stability 
Any closed-loop system, particularly type 1 systems such as position control systems, will become unstable 
if the open-loop gain is increased without bound. A closed-loop position control system is shown in 
block diagram form as figure 6.1.

Closed-loop stability

The use of frequency response
The use of the frequency response diagram approach, introduced in Chapter 5, is a useful technique 
for understanding the effect of the interaction between different open-loop transfer functions providing 
that the transfer function of the electrohydraulic system is sufficiently accurate. If the open-loop transfer 
function *MȦ+MȦ is considered then to ensure closed-loop stability the concept of gain and phase 
margins is useful. It will be recalled that at the onset of closed-loop instability the OLTF satisfies the 
following condition:
*MȦ+MȦ 
*MȦ+MȦ has a magnitude ratio of 1 (0dB)
*MȦ+MȦ has a phase angle of -180o 
The avoidance of instability is easy, in principle, by selecting a desired gain margin or phase margin. 
Consider figure 6.3 which illustrates an OLTF *MȦ+MȦ that has a stable closed-loop system. The 
gain and phase margins are defined and both are positive numbers.

Closed-loop stability
•	 the phase margin is defined when the magnitude ratio is 0dB. The gain margin is defined when 
the phase is -180o
•	 for the closed-loop system to be stable the magnitude ratio must have a negative dB value when 
the phase angle is -180o. This is the case shown
•	 suppose in figure 6.3 the magnitude ratio is -20dB when the phase angle is -180o then the gain 
margin is 20dB. This means that the OLTF gain can be increased by 20dB before closed-loop 
instability occurs. 
•	 suppose the magnitude ratio was +20dB when the phase angle is -180o then the phase margin 
is -20dB. This means that the closed-loop would be unstable and the OLTF gain must be 
decreased by 20dB to avoid closed-loop instability
•	 in practice seek a phase margin around 45o

Closed-loop stability
It can be seen that the servovalve contributes phase angle to the OLTF around the condition where 
the phase angle for the system only is -180o. The servovalve magnitude contributes little to the overall 
magnitude at this phase angle, but it is concluded at this stage that both servovalve and system dynamics 
must be considered. The OLTF is next shown.

By zooming into the phase angle diagram at a frequency between 260rad/s and 280rad/s it is deduced 
that the phase angle is -180o when Ȧ = 270rad/s (43Hz). The magnitude ratio is then read from the graph 
as -38.6dB and therefore the condition for the onset of closed-loop instability is determined as follows:

response, under proportional control, and some form of improvement is probably necessary.

From a more rigorous control theory point of view closed-loop stability of electrohydraulic control 
systems, which usually have stable open-loop transfer functions, requires that the roots of the closed-
loop characteristic equation must not have positive real parts.
There is a simple method of determining whether or not a characteristic equation has roots with positive 
real parts, known as Routh’s stability criterion, and more details may be found in the many standard 
reference books on control theory.

the actuator mid-position to an extension of 25mm. It can also be seen that the response is dominated

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Closed-loop stability
When the servoamplifier gain is set to its maximum value of 126mA/V then a steady-state small oscillation 
in position is observed. Although there is no large-scale position fluctuation, a large fluctuation in velocity/
pressure differential occurs, and this is often the case with position control systems. 
For a servodrive that has an appearance of a dominant over-damped transient response then the OLTF 
is dominated by a 1st order time constant effect:

These values are evident from the transient response diagram at the time when the output achieves 
approximately 63% of its steady-state value. 
The linearised transfer function is only valid in the absence of servoamplifier saturation, ±20mA 
in this example, and this has been included in the results shown. Current saturation occurs for 
*D! mA/V and so the concept of a linear 1st order closed-loop response is only valid for gains 
below this value. 
Comparing the linearised prediction with the exact simulation, not presented here, it turns out for this 
example that:
•	 the transient responses are almost identical in overall shape.
•	 the exact solution does not exhibit the oscillatory component in the position response as 
evident from the linearised results shown.
•	 when the servoamplifier gain is set to the value of 126mA/V then instability still occurs for 
the exact model but significant oscillations in position are not evident. However there are 
very significant oscillations in pressure differential.

However, this is only a calibration issue since to achieve any steady-state speed it is only necessary to

The transient response is too oscillatory and a further consideration of the gain is necessary or perhaps

improve the response but the closed-loop steady-state gain will be also be reduced. This example will

7	 Improving closed-loop 
behaviour
7.1	
Aim
To understand how to improve closed-loop behaviour via the following objectives:
•	 to first consider some methods of improving steady-state behaviour
•	 to then consider some basic methods of improving dynamic performance
•	 to introduce the use of a Programmable Servo Controller (PSC) 
7.2	
Some preliminary comments
There are several different types of control systems such as velocity control, position control, force control, 
pressure control and pressure differential control. For each type of control system the servovalve dynamics 
may be significant or may not be significant depending on the dynamics of the system and its load. It 
is therefore beyond the scope of this book to investigate all the combinations together with the many 
different types of methods that may be used to improve system performance and meet design objectives. 
In addition, the published literature on electrohydraulic control systems abounds with “modern” methods 
of control that are interesting, yet often mathematically defined in a way that cannot be practically 
implemented and also present issues of robustness to changing system conditions. These advanced 
methods must be pursued but this chapter considers just a few examples of the common methods that 
seem to be implemented by industry.
7.3	
The use of servoamplifier dither to improve steady-state error drift for a 
position control system
High-frequency, low amplitude current dither is used to improve the small variations in position steady-
state error that inevitably occurs in practice. Consider a position servodrive with a servovalve having 
a small amount of under-lap and has its optimum load to give ostensibly a zero steady-state error in 
position, and an actual system studied by the author. The demanded position is y = 0.4 mm and a 
low-frequency triangular input voltage is applied and having an amplitude of 18.5 mV. This means that 
ideally the cylinder position/input voltage graph should be a straight line where the cylinder moves from 
-0.048 mm to +0.448 mm. Results are shown in figure 7.1 for 3 cycles.

Figure 7.1a) is an interesting result in that it displays a position error variation that could be explained 
qualitatively in terms of hysteresis, drift etc. Note also that as the triangular voltage input slope changes 
sign then the actuator momentarily moves in the wrong direction. However it is dramatically clear that 
when servovalve dither is introduced a much superior performance is achieved as shown in figure 7.1b). 
Servovalve dither is added to the input signal at the servoamplifier. In this example the dither frequency 
is 150Hz and the amplitude is the same as the triangular demanded variation voltage, i.e. 18.5mV. This 
amplitude produces a servovalve current amplitude of 0.19mA and within the under-lap equivalent 
current of 0.27mA. 
A typical manufacturer’s specification would indicate hysteresis as being less that 3% of rated current 
with the threshold less than 0.5% of rated current without dither. If dither is used then the amplitude 
should be less than 10% of rated current.
7.4	
The effect of spool under-lap on the steady-state error for a position 
control system 
Whatever the type of intentional spool lap, a servodrive will always have a very small position error. It 
was briefly discussed earlier that a servovalve spool may be symmetrically critically-lapped, over-lapped 
or under-lapped. While a critically-lapped spool should give a zero position error, for the idealised 
servovalve performance characteristic, this will not be so for over-lapped and under-lapped spools. For 
an over-lapped spool the position can be any value within the over-lap region equivalent to a current 
value of LRP$ 
Position error for an under-lapped spool may not be so obvious and is now worth pursuing. Recalling 
the flow rate equations, Chapter 2, for a servovalve with a symmetrically under-lapped spool, the under-
lap being equivalent to ±iu mA:

This analysis leads to some important points:
•	 the supply pressure may be matched to the load to produce a zero position error. At this 
condition 3 3 3V Looking at this in another way, if it is practically feasible to adjust 
the supply pressure until both line steady-state pressures are equal then the position error 
should be minimum, ideally zero
•	 at the optimum condition with 3 3§3V the pressure differential across the actuator 
piston will be close to zero thus minimising leakage across the piston
•	 at the matched load condition the open-loop extending velocity is the same as the retracting 
velocity, that is, the open-loop gain does not change with direction of motion. This is preferable 
from a closed-loop control point of view

Results for current error are shown and it can be seen that the theory match the measurements reasonably 
well with the measured pressures being a little lower than the theoretical values. The condition for zero 
steady-state position error matches the predicted value. The result of the cylinder position error at no-

A possible design guide for setting under-lap at the null condition may be derived by considering the 
leakage flow back to tank, that is with no position error and each line pressure at half supply pressure 
at the matched load condition. The leakage flow back to tank, 4OHDNDJH, may be deduced and compared 
with the rated flow as follows:

Now it is desirable that the leakage flow to tank is minimised since it also represents a power loss and 
hence drop in efficiency. As a first step assume that the leakage flow is to be less than 10% of the rated 
flow. It then follows from equation (7.7) that:

For example, at a supply pressure of 210bar then LXLUDWHG Clearly only a very small under-lap can 
be tolerated in practice.

So increasing spool leakage back to tank decreases the resistance and improves damping, although the

Steady-state tracking error in response to a velocity demand for a position 
control system
Now consider a linear position servodrive which is demanded to track at a particular velocity for part 
of its duty cycle by applying a ramp voltage at the input. This is a common design specification, so 
consider figure 7.2.

So, there will always be a position error when tracking a velocity input but it can be reduced by increasing 
the open-loop gain .. However there is a limit to the value of . since increasing it will eventually lead 
to closed-loop instability as previously discussed in Chapter 6.
One way of reducing the steady-state error for a velocity demand is to introduce Derivative feedforward 
action as shown in figure 7.3.

Figure 7.3 A linear servodrive position control system with feedforward control
The forward Derivative term is sτd and it will be seen that a first-order filter, with a time constant τ, 
has been included to indicate its necessity in practice to minimise noise effects and rapid fluctuations in 
demand. It is particularly important to consider the type of demands used when Derivative feedforward 
control is implemented. Rapid changes in demand imply high derivatives which may cause a rapid, and 
possibly undesirable, opening or closure of the servovalve spool. 
Again applying a ramp input \G 8GW and using the Final Value Theorem now gives the steady-state 
tracking error as:

Comparing (7.16) with (7.15), for the case with no feedforward term, then it can be seen that the

time constant to have a value of ĲG§.

Considering previous examples 6.2 and 7.2 where the linearised second-order OLTF has an undamped 
natural frequency ȦQ = 307rad/s and a damping ratio ȗ = 0.021. It was shown that the closed-loop system 
will become unstable when . = 2ȗȦQ = 12.9. For the purpose of example select . = 5 and investigate

For an ideal system the output should achieve 8mm after 0.8 seconds. With no feedforward the linearisd 
analysis predicts a steady-state position error given by:
\H 8G.  P PP
The exact simulation validates this prediction. With a feedforward Derivative time constant of  
ĲG . V then the linearised analysis predicts zero steady-state position error. The exact 
simulation showed a very small error of 0.024mm and changing the time constant from 0.2s to 0.202s 
produced a zero steady-state error. The closed-loop velocity tracking error performance is therefore very 
sensitive to the feedforward gain setting in this example. 
The pressure differential results show that a very low amplitude oscillation occurs close to the servodrive 
undamped natural frequency and could not be damped using feedforward control for this system. 
However, the maximum pressure differential was only around 1.5bar for the input condition tested and 
would probably not be detected in practice.

Optimising the closed-loop transient response
In some cases, a control system transient response may be optimised using the Integral of Time multiplied 
by Absolute Error criterion, the ITAE criterion as briefly discussed in Chapter 5. For a 3rd order transfer 
function, with a unity gain only in the numerator, then the required form is as follows:

The transient response to a step input produces a very small overshoot. The idea is to match the actual 
closed-loop transfer function with (7.17) which may not always be possible in practice. 
For example consider the following OLTF:

Equating terms in (7.17) and (7.19) and combining gives:

Considering example 7.3 where ȦQ = 307rad/s and ȗ = 0.021 then the ITAE criterion cannot be achieved 
for this particular system unless damping can be significantly increased in some way. Increasing viscous 
damping by changing the fluid viscosity or deliberately introducing leakage damping are usually not an 
option. Under-lapping the servovalve spool might be considered as an option but probably again not 
achievable due to the large under-lap inevitably required with its inherent leakage flow and power loss. 
Using additional feedback sensor terms or adding a compensating network is usually required to improved 
closed-loop performance and will be discussed later in this chapter.

Velocity sensing or Derivative computation 
Linear velocity sensors are usually of the type that induce a voltage proportional to velocity via an 
electromagnetic circuit that does not require an external power supply. Other types are available such 
as optical grating sensors but tend to be more expensive. For rotary actuators then an optical or brush-
type tachogenerator is either directly attached or geared to the motor output shaft, or acoustic wave 
technology sensors may be connected in-line. Self-generating linear sensors, optical and brush-type 
tachogenerator have been used by the author although the brush-type tachogenerator does suffer from 
added noise generation. 
Velocity may be directly measured, or computed, and used as additional feedback signal. In addition 
Derivative computation may be used in the forward loop, and commonly known as Proportional 
plus Derivative control, PD control. Both aspects are shown in figure 7.4 for a linear position 
servodrive example.

Figure 7.1 A linear servodrive position control system with additional derivative terms
Again it is pointed out that should PD be used in the forward loop then a filter should be included with 
the Derivative term to minimise sudden changes in input conditions and also to minimse any noise that 
will inevitably occur in practice. An initial analysis will neglect this filter.

It was shown earlier that this position control system without velocity feedback is stable providing 
. ȗȦQ If this is ensured then the closed-loop system with velocity or derivative action is inherently 
stable in the absence of servovalve dynamics. It may be found in reality that velocity damping may not 
improve the closed-loop transient response but may help to aid closed-loop stability, depending upon 
the nature of the system dynamics.
7.8	
Additional acceleration, or pressure, feedback
An accelerometer may be used for improving the closed-loop response. This is an expensive approach 
but does offer a way forward in some advanced control systems applications. 
A measure of acceleration feedback may be obtained using two pressure transducers but the signal must 
be filtered, using a high-pass filter, to remove the bias voltage due to the load force, or torque, effect. In 
addition a single-rod cylinder will require unequal area gain correction by the pressure sensors. 
Figure 7.5 shows the system block diagram with the acceleration determined using an acceleration sensor. 
If it digitally-computed from position using a Programmable Servo Controller then, as with computed 
derivative action, an additional filter is desirable in practice.

It was shown earlier that without acceleration feedback then the requirement for stability is that K< 2ζωn. 
It follows that if the closed-loop is stable without acceleration feedback then it will be inherently stable 
with the inclusion of acceleration feedback.
Example 7.4
Consider the linear double-rod actuator, example 6.2, and where a linearised analysis suggested that 
the transient response will become unstable at the point when the servoamplifier gain *D = 126mA/V, 
. = 12.6. Investigate the use of additional acceleration feedback using the exact simulation model and 
selecting the critical gain *D = 126mA/V, . = 12.6.

The following points arise:
•	 with acceleration feedback the maximum pressure differential is around 20 bar compared 
with around 110bar without acceleration feedback
•	 the introduction of acceleration feedback has removed the high frequency oscillation in 
pressure differential
•	 the position transient behaviour might be considered as improved in an overall sense but 
the response cannot be made initially faster by the use of additional acceleration feedback 
•	 increasing the accelerometer gain +D will create a larger over-shoot and the response at the 
beginning will be more sluggish

Proportional+Integral+Derivative (PID) control
When there is an issue of steady-state error and/or dynamic response, particularly for process control 
systems with a pure delay and large time constants, it is common to consider PID control in the forward 
loop. Consider the general case for a servodrive shown as figure 7.6.

In electrohydraulic control systems PID control is useful if a free integrator does not exist in the system 
forward loop transfer function, for example speed control, since by definition the integral component 
in PID control adds this effect. It does seem in practice that for the case of steady-state error removal it 
is usual to just consider PI control by adding an integral term. 
The Derivative element of PID control does not seem to be popular for many electrohydraulic control 
systems, particularly servodrives, one exception perhaps being for materials dynamic test machines 
where the load dynamics includes material stiffness. The machine manufacturer will provide design 
rules for setting up the controller.
In some control systems such as with a servovalve directly moving a pilot valve poppet, which then 
controls flow into the drive actuator, then a double intergrator term dominates the OLTF. the addition of 
Derivative control in the forward loop, or in the feedback loop, can be considered. If derivative action is 
generated via a digital controller then again the signal will require bandwidth limitation to avoid higher 
noise frequencies being amplified. 
For conventional servodrives the use of Derivative control in the forward loop has the same effect as 
adding it into the feedback loop. It also seems that wherever it is added it may not have any significant 
effect on reducing pressure oscillations.
Example 7.5
Consider the motor speed control system investigated as Example 6.3 where stability was ensured using 
frequency response, and an open-loop gain .= 0.76 was selected for proportional control only. The 
system is again shown.

•	 the existing gain . = 0.76 was retained
•	 derivative action was first introduced using the computer simulation and a time constant 
was found by trial and error, a suitable value being ĲG = 0.01s to give an acceptable transient 
response overshoot
•	 integral action was then added and a time constant selected, coincidentally, to be the same 
as that for derivative action and therefore ĲL = 0.01s
The PID tuning then produced an acceptable transient response. Further tuning could be pursued, 
particularly with regard to gain selection and the tracking error in response to a ramp demand speed. 
This is not pursued here and the new design performance is now shown.

further addition of integral control has resulted in the desired steady-state speed.

Gain scheduling using a PSC
Many servodrives have different dynamic characteristics depending upon the direction of motion. Some 
examples are as follows:
i)	 Linear actuators
•	 double-rod with a load mass and vertically mounted
•	 single-rod, horizontally or vertically mounted
ii)	 Motors
•	 with a uni-directional load torque
•	 motor/winch unit, resisting load when lifting, runaway load when lowering
iii)	Pressure vessel control
It is possible to vary the gain in either direction using a Programmable Servo Controller (PSC), providing 
of course that the direction of motion can be deduced. The gain change required can be assessed from a 
linearised analysis or simply by practical trial and error. Considering the case of a single-rod actuator with 
a uni-directional load force, then it was shown in Chapter 3 that the open-loop flow gains are given by:

Therefore the closed-loop position transient response will be different in shape when extending and 
retracting due to the changing flow gain. If performance is not acceptable then a PSC can be used to 
match the flow gains in both directions, one could be increased or the other decreased or a combination 
of both.
7.11	
Digital control algorithms using a PSC
The ease of using computers to control a servodrive, or the use of a more convenient Programmable 
Servo Controller dedicated to servodrive control, now means that a digital equivalent of an analogue 
controller is relatively easy to implement. In practice hydraulic noise and undesirable frequency effects, 
such as pump/motor speed harmonics, will probably require filtering. In addition the PSC will be 
accepting analogue input signals, performing digital control law generation and sending out analogue 
control signals. 
The overall process of digital filtering and digital filter implementation is quite simple in practice. This may 
be illustrated when the process of time differentiation is represented by the backward step substitution 
method, the simplest of many possible substitutions and more ‘advanced’ methods. Consider the process 
of numerical differentiation as follows:

Therefore the implementation of a PI controller requires the storage of one previously sampled input 
signal and one previously sampled output signal.
These are just basic examples and have been used successfully by the author. The backward difference 
approach has often been found to be better than using more complicated substitutions, such as trapezoidal, 
which can cause closed-loop stability problems. Many more complicated, and ostensibly better, algorithms 
may be used as evident from control literature. Also, multi-input/output PSC’s have a library of digital 
filter and transfer functions that may be readily included within the control loop.

Improving the dynamic performance of an open-loop motor servodrive 
using a PSC and pressure derivative feedback
The system is as shown in figure 7.7 and its steady-state performance improvement using a PSC was 
considered in Chapter 3. The servovalve flow characteristic was linearised and the supply pressure was 
adapted using an electrohydraulic pressure relief valve. This resulted in an improved steady-state speed 
characteristic and an improved steady-state efficiency.

Figure 7.7 Linearisation of the servovalve flow characteristic, supply pressure adaption and dynamic improvement with 
dynamic pressure feedback  using a PSC
Because the servovalve pressure square root chracteristic has almost been removed then the servovalve 
adds little to no damping for the motor servodrive. It should be noted that this is not a closed-loop control 
system using speed measurement feedback, it is an open-loop system with performance compensation.
The motor in this application is uni-directional and the commercially-available proportional control 
valve is designed such that only the driving port is pressure-active as described in Chapter 3.
The open-loop transfer function is dominated by fluid compressibility and motor/load inertia and 
therefore the servodrive has negligible damping.The system transfer function is therefore given by:

where 'P is the motor displacement, NTL is the flow gain and *D is the servoamplifier gain.
Without some form of system stabilisation the dynamic performance is unacceptable so the concept of 
dynamic pressure feedback, discussed earlier, is now be implemented by the PSC. Since only pressure 
3 is active in this motor control system a voltage is subtracted from 9G to provide system stabilisation,

There are other issues to be considered before digital implementation is intoduced as follows:
•	 in reality the accumulation of servovalve dynamics and proportional relief valve dynamics, 
together with system noise, has a small but detectable effect on the system performance
•	 the effect of higher-order dynamics is to create a small phase shift with respect to the algebraic 
linearisation process and this is compounded if digital filtering is used to minimise signal noise
•	 signal noise arises from both fluid flow effects and the pressure ripple generated by the supply 
pump and the motor, and may be filtered to some extent by using the filter translator available 
on the PSC card
•	 the supply pump operates at a nominal speed of 1440 rpm and the load line pressure ripple is 
rich in harmonics at both the pumping frequency and the motor frequency. The time domain 
signal shows that the motor fundamental frequency dominates the pressure ripple and will 
of course vary as the motor speed is varied. The pressure ripple fundamental frequency does 
not present particular computation problems using the PSC card, providing higher-frequency 
component effects are minimised.
In practice minimising unwanted frequency components is achieved quite simply by using digital low-
pass filters. The PSC card filter translator is provided to allow the user to input filter data in a high level 
floating point format which is then converted to low level integer form for use with the filter function 
block. The PSC card was set to operate with a sample time of T = 4ms, that is a sampling frequency of 
250Hz. 
Some results are shown as figure 7.8 at a constant minimum load where the motor speed was demanded 
to change from 500rpm to 800rpm. Comparisons are made with conventional control at a fixed supply 
pressure of 3V = 90bar and “intelligent” control with variable supply pressure, optimum efficiency control 
and dynamic pressure feedback.

Figure 7.8 A comparison of conventional control and “intelligent” control of an openloop motor servodrive 
[Davies RM and Watton J. Intelligent Control of an Electrohydraulic Motor Drive System. Journal of Mechatronics, 
Vol 5, No 5, 1995, 527–540]
The major conclusions from this project are: 
•	 the conventional dynamic behaviour is highly non-linear, the response being sluggish at high 
motor speeds and oscillatory at lower motor speeds as expected under conventional constant 
supply pressure conditions
•	 active control of supply pressure showed only marginal changes in steady-state values as the 
steady-state speed is changed 
•	 under ‘intelligent’ control the non-linear transient speed effects are reduced, combined with a 
reduction in the required supply pressure when appropriate
•	 intelligent control has reduced the tendency of the active line pressure to cavitate, that is, fall 
to the fluid vapor pressure
•	 symmetry of dynamic behaviour at the different speeds is not exactly achieved due to the desire 
to also achieve optimum efficiency at a servovalve pressure drop of 15bar
•	 at the chosen servovalve pressure drop of 15bar the flow characteristic is not ideally linearised 
at higher speeds. This could be improved by moving to a higher pressure differential at the 
expense of a reduction in efficiency

Figure 8.1 Pressure control of a vessel
A pressure sensor is needed to provide the closed-loop signal and usually its dynamics may be neglected. 
From what has previously been discussed it should be realised that the pressure vessel provides an 
integration process for the open-loop system and therefore the closed-loop system should not have a 
steady-state error. A 3-port servovalve is sufficient here, that is only one output port is required to charge 
and discharge the pressure vessel. Neglecting servovalve dynamics the system equations, for proportional 
control, are as follows:

+S is the pressure sensor gain, *D is the servoamplifier gain and 3G is pressure demand. For proportional 
control the servovalve current is always positive when the pressure is rising and always negative when the 
pressure is falling. These equations may be implicitly solved but the solutions will not be discussed here. 
Note that the charging pressure may exceed the servovalve supply pressure in some cases and therefore 
when considering the exact simulation model this must be taken into account. This is done as follows:

Also in the simulation model it is important to ensure that the pressure cannot fall below zero. In reality 
this is a complex phenomenon when cavitation occurs but often in simulation practice a simple lower 
limit on pressure is introduced at the pressure integration block.

Some transient responses, when charging and discharging, are shown as figure 8.2 for different demanded 
pressures and using Matlab Simulink simulation software. The demanded pressure is 3G and this 
1st order closed-loop system clearly demonstrates exponential-type responses when both charging

Proportional+Integral control, no servovalve dynamics 
A bleed valve, connected back to tank, may be used to ensure trapped air is released prior to testing, 
or deliberately introduced to provide additional damping. Also, there may be an undesirable external 
leakage. For these cases PI control may be used to ensure correct steady-state performance. Assuming 
a linear leakage characteristic for low leakage flow rates then the flow continuity equation at the load 
now becomes:

The integrator due to fluid compressibility does now no longer exist, hence the need for PI control. The 
linearised transfer function concept results in the system block diagram shown in figure 8.4.

The stable closed-loop 2nd order transfer function (8.12) has a dynamic term in its numerator so the 
transfer function cannot really be used in a traditional 2nd order sense for design. As a preliminary 
design it is better to use over-damping, for example starting with ȗ=2, so considering the denominator 
of the CLTF then gives:

Given that OHDN

from equation (8.13). Again remember from earlier work that the flow coefficient NTL given in (8.12) 
for calculating

 is different when charging and discharging. 
The overshoot when charging and undershoot when discharging may be different for different 
combinations of demanded pressures. An improved response may be obtained by adapting the open-
loop gain for either the charging or the discharging part of the duty cycle, and which may easily be done 
using a Programmable Servo Controller (PSC).

Pressure and force control
Example 8.1
A pressure control system for life-cycle testing of radiators has a design requirement to achieve 95% of the 
steady-state charging pressure in at least 0.05sec and for a charging pressure of 180bar. The discharging 
pressure is 10bar. 
i)	 Determine an approximate servoamplifer gain *D by first considering the linearised transfer 
function approximation
ii)	 Then consider the exact transient response to determine a more appropriate servoamplifier 
gain and determine an obtainable duty cycle frequency
iii)	 Investigate gain scheduling 
System data are as follows:
A typical industrial mineral oil, fluid bulk modulus ȕ = 1.4×109N/m2
The total pressurised volume V=2 litres
The servovalve spool is critically-lapped, Q =

Supply pressure 3V = 240bar
Servovalve damping ratio ȗ = 1, undamped natural frequency IQ = 110Hz.
Servoamplifier rating ±20mA
Each pressure sensor has the range 250bar = 10V, so +S = 40×10-8 V/Nm-2

In response to step demand change in pressure, the design requirement is to achieve at least 95% of the 
steady-state charging pressure in 0.05 seconds. Using the linearised transfer function transient charging

The exact non-linear simulation is then considered with an initial servoamplifier gain of *D = 8.1mA/V. 
This was then adjusted to give the charging response design requirement, resulting in a slightly reduced 
value of *D =7.2mA/V as now shown.

Pressure and force control
The design allowed a duty cycle frequency of typically 2.5Hz to be generated. The servoamplifier gain has 
been selected to meet the minimum design criterion and the response can be made faster by increasing 
the servoamplifier gain. A number of points arise: 
•	 the response does not reveal that at the start of charging and at the start of discharging the 
servoamplifier saturates at ±20mA for a short period
•	 increasing the servoamplifier gain will make both the charging and discharging responses 
faster and increase the duty cycle frequency possible. However, servovalve dynamics have 
been neglected at this stage
•	 a linearised transfer function approach can give a useful design guide but an accurate 
computer simulation is required to determine the correct transient behaviour
ii) Response improvement, servovalve dynamics included.
The performance is first evaluated using the exact simulation. The response is made faster by simply 
increasing the servoamplifier gain. In fact increasing the gain from *D =7.2mA/V to *D =22mA/V gave 
the result shown next.

These are extremely high servoamplifier gains and will cause the servoamplifier to dynamically saturate 
and then a linearised analysis is not valid. The exact non-linear simulation, including servovoalve 
dynamics, with servoamplifier current saturation shows that the closed-loop system is unstable at the 
following conditions:
charging	
*D § 160mA/V
discharging	
*D § 250mA/V
The linearised analysis therefore over-predicts the gain condition for instability when charging and 
significantly over-predicts the gain condition for instability when discharging.

iii) Gain scheduling
The charging response is acceptable but the discharging response is more sluggish and could be improved 
by increasing the gain when discharging. Now consider gain scheduling and increasing the discharging 
gain by the ratio of the flow gains:

The response is now very similar for both charging and discharging, and the duty cycle frequency may 
be increased to at least 10Hz, which actually may be too high in practice.

Force control of a servoactuator
Now consider force control for materials/structural testing. A compressive load fatigue test on a structure 
is shown conceptually as figure 8.5. The demand signal will cause the actuator to drive the structure to 
its desired deflection and ostensibly match the required mean force.

Pressure and force control
In practice a materials testing machine servoactuator will have a load cell attached to the actuator rod and 
it makes better dynamic sense to use this rather than pressure differential. In the author’s experience it 
has been more difficult to improve the closed-loop response with pressure differential control compared 
with force control to such an extent that even a variety of compensation techniques have proved fruitless. 
For a force control system the linearised equations for a servovalve/cylinder are as previously used and

The material stiffness is NPN/m and y is the structure deflection from its unloaded position. Servoactuator 
leakage has been included since this plays an important role in how the closed-loop system behaves.

The following observations are made:
•	 this 3rd order system can become unstable and a suitable gain . must be selected, and different 
to that given by (8.24) if servovalve dynamics are included
•	 the steady-state force will not achieve the demanded value unless K >>1 or flow losses are 
negligible such that 5  However, this is only an input calibration issue in practice since 
the input signal may be adjusted to give the required steady-state load force
•	 the steady-state velocity will be zero as required irrespective of the value of leakage resistance 5
PID control.
This is considered to ostensibly improve performance but results in a higher-order characteristic equation. 
This means that explicit PID gain selection requires care and controller tuning information will be 
supplied by the experienced testing machine manufacturer. Consider therefore the system with PI control 
only as shown in figure 8.7.

The following observations are made:
•	 the closed-loop characteristic equation is now 4th order and the conditions to avoid closed-
loop instability are not in a meaningful explicit design form. However, a suitable gain must be 
selected to avoid closed-loop instability
•	 the closed-loop response to a step input force demand will now result in no steady-state error 
in force and velocity and irrespective of any system leakage resistance 5

It is particularly useful to now use Matlab Control System Toolbox to investigate this OLTF. First consider 
the roots of the denominator and determined as follows:
a = [1.95e-6 2.35e-4 2.1 1];
roots(a);
-60 + M1036
-60 – M1036
-0.5
Clearly the denominator of the OLTF is characterised by a 1st order component and a very lightly damped 
2nd order high frequency component. Now using the frequency response plotting facility assuming unity 
gain in the numerator:
a = tf([0 0 0 1],[1.95e-6 2.35e-4 2.1 1]);

The components of the OLTF may clearly be seen, and by zooming into a narrower frequency range the 
-180o phase angle occurs when Ȧ = 1038rad/s and with a gain of -48dB. Hence the onset of closed-loop 
instability occurs when the magnitude is lifted by +48dB.This gives:
+48 =20log(23.7*D) → *D = 10.6mA/V
Using the traditional approach the closed-loop characteristic equation is given by:

The onset of instability occurs, by equating the Imaginary term to zero, which gives Ȧ = 1038rad/s 
(165Hz) and from the Real term, when equated to zero, then *D = 10.6 mA/V. 
The important conclusion at this stage is that the servovalve undamped natural frequency is 110Hz so 
it is clear that the linearised OLTF must also include servovalve dynamics. 
The new OLTF is now 5th order and is given by:

The exact simulation was then investigated and gave:

*D = 50mA/V 
Results are now compared with gains set at approximately ¼ of the value required to cause closed-loop 
instability. The linearised transfer function gain was set to *D = 16mA/V and the gain in the exact 
simulation was set to *D = 12mA/V.

Other points drawn from this study are as follows:
•	 the general transient trend between the linearised analysis and the exact solution compare well, 
highlighting again the value of a preliminary linearised analysis
•	 it will be recalled that under Proportional control the linearised analysis and the exact simulation 
predict the same steady-state conditions as follows:

For the gains selected in the previous diagram the steady-state errors are negligible. 
•	 the addition of either Integral control and/or Derivative control, not shown here, makes little 
difference to the dynamic response
•	 adding Integral control for the gain used was of little value since the steady-state error was 
negligible under Proportional control. In addition, the transient response took much longer 
to decay to its steady-state value
•	 the addition of Derivative control had no effect on the overshoot, the closed-loop being 
more prone to instability even when the Derivative gain was set to just a small value

Pressure and force control
Now consider cyclic fatigue testing at low frequencies. 
A small amplitude sinusoid is used for fatigue testing and over many cycles that could last from hours to 
days. The mean force may be large and the servoactuator must be able to provide this value in addition 
to the cyclic force.
Following the application of the demand sinusoid, at the structure mean deflection, the displacement 
settles to its sinusoidal motion and actuator higher-order actuator dynamics may be neglected as a first 
approximation and equivalent to neglecting fluid compressibility and moving inertia, C = 0 and L = 0. 
For the PI control case the load force transfer function is as follows, and also assuming that Rv/R is 
negligible:

The important points that arise from this analysis are:
•	 since .   +I *D NTL 5 $ then the undamped natural frequency ȦQ is independent of the 
resistance 5 as would be expected
•	 both the undamped natural frequency ȦQ and the damping ratio ȗ are affected by the values 
of the integrator gain .L and the servoamplifier gain *D assuming the remaining system 
parameters are fixed
•	 the actual amplitude of excitation achieved depends upon the appropriate transfer function 
magnitude ratio at the frequency of interest
•	 the selection of the appropriate operating resistance 5 a very important issue. The spool is 
dynamically open during each half cycle and the spool valve provides resistive damping 5VY. 
This must be added, in parallel, to any actuator leakage resistance 5DFW.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Recalling that if the spool is dynamically open then flow is being delivered and the spool valve provides 
resistive damping 5VY. This must be added, in parallel, to any actuator resistance 5DFW should it be 
appropriate. To get a ‘feel’ for the servovalve damping effect then consider a servovalve average resistance 
over one half cycle and assume sinusoidal motion at the required amplitude, whatever the value of the

Such low undamped natural frequencies justifies the neglect of actuator dynamics. 
For completeness, the linearised transfer function is transformed into the frequency domain and the 
magnitude ratio is evaluated at a frequency of 2Hz. 
When this magnitude ratio is multiplied by the demanded peak-to-peak value of oscillation required 
(1mm) then the actual peak-to-peak value may be determined. This is now shown together with the 
variation measured from the exact simulation with all system dynamics included.

The following observations are therefore made:
•	 the mean position/force value was readily achieved for any servoamplifier gain by adjustment 
of the input mean voltage. This was not required if Integral control is added
•	 servovalve damping is important during cyclic testing, even with a critically-lapped spool
•	 the desired cyclic peak-to-peak value of 1mm could only be achieved around an integrator 
gain setting of .L § 8 s-1 unless the demand signal amplitude is changed
•	 for a particular leakage resistance R a unique integrator gain is required to produce the required 
force variation for testing
•	 if leakage develops with use then the addition of integral control can help, but gain selection 
may need continual tuning

Pressure and force control
•	 with some simple pre-calculations a linearised transfer function evaluation can give a very 
good estimate of the closed-loop frequency response to a demanded sinusoid
•	 force control is more complicated than might initially be expected
Finally consider now a digital control alagorithm for PI control. 
Recalling that a value of the integrator gain .L = 8s-1 was chosen for the purpose of illustration. Hence 
Ĳ .L = 0.125s. For this example a low sampling frequency of 100Hz is selected giving a sampling 
interval T=10ms. The PI algorithm then becomes:

No detectable difference in dynamic performance is evident, even for this relatively low sampling 
frequency, and aided by the low testing frequency. The sampling effect can just be seen at the PI output 
under digital control.

9	 Closing comments and further 
reading guidance
The direction of this introduction to servovalve-controlled systems design should indicate to the reader 
that in practice a pragmatic approach will probably have to be adopted, particularly when open-loop 
models are experimentally obtained, or are a combination of well-established theory combined with 
experimental data. Another problem is that models change with operating conditions and control 
strategies must be robust over the entire operating range of the system. 
Clearly the vast amount of industrial and commercial applications around the world illustrates that 
servodrive systems successfully operate and there would not appear to be a problem. However, are the 
systems operating at an optimum level of control and efficiency and will the control challenges of, for 
example, using non-mineral oil fluids in the future be overcome, particularly for very high power systems? 
Notwithstanding the undisclosed research and development effort by industry, there is a vast amount 
of fluid power literature in journals and international conferences. This shows that fluid power control 
is being studied, to an advanced level in some cases. A variety of modern control techniques, including 
artificial intelligence methods, have been applied to very specific circuits and with perhaps a reluctance by 
the industry to accept them as sufficiently robust for commercial take-up; this should not deter continuing 
research and development. Many useful references and more detailed background theory are given in the 
following author’s supporting books together with other industrial, journal and conference information.
