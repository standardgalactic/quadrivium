The way I look at being a senior is this: We 
got there ahead of the rest of the pack.
Let those behind us get all excited over tweets 
and iPods and video games that simulate the 
challenges and joys of life. We’ve been there 
before — before there were computers, as a 
matter of fact.
When the PC arrived it was hard to imagine 
what its ultimate role would be. We played 
some games, we used it to balance our check-
books, and we learned to put aside our dumb 
typewriters and use the computer as something 
with a new title: a word processor.
And then everything began to come together. 
The computer was connected to the telephone 
system and through it to a completely new 
concept, the World Wide Web (now more 
commonly known as the Internet).
Through that connection, the computer 
became a carrier of a new kind of communica-
tion, called e-mail. And over the same wire 
(and its faster cousins including DSL and cable 
television connections) came Internet video, 
Internet radio, and digital images.
And though Sears no longer sends out its huge 
catalog, the Internet as the replacement for 
mail order has become a major part of com-
merce in our society. There is very little that 
you (and your credit card or an electronic link 
directly to your bank) cannot purchase online.

Introduction 
About This Book
The purpose of this book is not to point out how stupid you are. I 
don’t believe that for a second . . . in fact, it is our generation that 
invented all of these great devices.
But it is also true that for some of us it is important to update our 
metaphors and clear out our mental attics so that we can function 
efficiently as seniors. I’ll try to explain, in plain English, just enough 
about how a computer works to help you understand it. And, as 
promised in the book’s title, I’ll show you ways you can make simple 
repairs to your computer that will extend its life, save you money, and 
amaze the youngsters. 
Foolish Assumptions
You have a computer and you want to fix a problem, prevent a prob-
lem, or be able to intelligently discuss your needs and wants with your 
14-year-old grandson. Nothing foolish there. I also assume that you 
don’t have an advanced degree in computer programming or electrical 
engineering. That’s just fine. 
The information in this book should be of use to any personal 
computer (PC) user. The differences between a desktop and a laptop, 
between a PC and a Mac, or between a machine running Microsoft 
Windows, Mac OS, or another operating system are not that great 
anymore.
But for the record, I assume the following as your standard machine:
 
➟ A PC.
 
➟ An Intel or AMD microprocessor (which together 
account for nearly all current processing units 
in PCs)
 
➟ A current version of the Microsoft Windows operat-
ing system (Windows XP, Windows Vista, or 
Windows 7)

➟
3
 Fix Your Own Computer For Seniors For Dummies
 
➟ A current Web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
Mozilla Firefox, or other similar products, including 
Google Chrome)
Why You Need This Book
My children never knew a world without Nintendo or PCs or e-mail. I 
once told my daughter to make a “carbon copy” of something she was 
about to mail and she looked at me as if I had two heads. When I 
explained what I meant she rolled her eyes, and I felt very, very old.
But for the rest of us, the fact that we have a history (we remember life 
before Google, before YouTube, before cell phones) sometimes makes 
it harder to deal with the fast pace of change.
Just as you don’t need to understand fuel injection or the chemistry of 
a catalytic convertor in order to drive your car to the post office, you 
also don’t have to upgrade a chipset or decode a binary file to be able 
to use a personal computer.
But when it comes to making simple repairs or directing a service cen-
ter to do them for you, it does help to know what those things are.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses certain conventions to highlight important information 
and help you find your way around, including these:
Icons
 
 Helpful suggestions for tasks in the steps lists.
 
 Potentially dangerous things to avoid.
Stuff you type
When you have to type something onscreen using the keyboard you’ll 
see it in bold. Except for right now.

➟

Introduction 
Figures
Many have notes or other markings to draw your attention to a spe-
cific part of the figure. The text tells you what to look for; the figure 
notes help you find it.
Menu commands
This arrow symbol ➪ shows a sequence of steps on a computer menu. 
For example, Start➪All Programs➪Accessories means to click the Start 
button, click All Programs, and then click Accessories.
Options and buttons
Various versions of Windows use a mix of upper-and-lowercase, all 
uppercase, and even sOmetimes an odd construction like this one to 
indicate your options. If you’re clicking on one of them, their style of 
presentation does not matter. (The sOmetimes example is the sort of 
thing that appears in some onscreen menus; it is meant to indicate 
that in addition to clicking on the words to choose them, you can use 
a keyboard combination like Alt plus the capitalized letter. In this 
instance, Alt+O would choose the sOmetimes option.)
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into logical sections, but you don’t have to 
read it front to back.
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster
A toaster, or a bicycle, or a desk fan are each relatively complex pieces 
of technology. But when they stop browning bread, pushing the 
wheel, or blowing air the reason for their failure is usually very obvi-
ous. You can see the broken part and you might even be able to fix it 
with a screwdriver or a hammer. Alas, that’s not the case with a com-
puter. In Chapter 1, I show you how to get to know the parts you can 
see, like the mouse, keyboard, monitor, printer, and connection ports. 

➟
5
 Fix Your Own Computer For Seniors For Dummies
In Chapter 2, I take a tour inside the box, to help you understand the 
brain of your PC. And in Chapter 3, I introduce you to the operating 
system (Windows for most of us) and other major pieces of software.
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance
Here we explore healthy habits for you and your machine. In Chapter 
4 you explore how to maintain, update, and repair Windows and soft-
ware. In Chapter 5 it’s time to read about proper computer hygiene, 
including keeping things clean and cool. In Chapter 6 it’s time to 
think about dealing with evil-doers; I show you how to play defense 
against viruses, malware, and spam. In Chapter 7 I’ll help you decide 
when and how to seek expert assistance and also give some pointers 
on weighing the cost of repair against the price of replacement of your 
PC or its major parts.
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware
Does the hardware exist to run the software, or do you need software 
in order to use the hardware? It doesn’t really matter; one is not 
much use without the other. In Chapter 8, we’ll look into the display 
or monitor. In Chapter 9, I’ll help you solve basic electrical and 
mechanical problems. In Chapter 10, I’ll explain how to change or 
upgrade your PC’s memory. In Chapter 11, I’ll do the same for hard 
disk drives and CD or DVD drives. In Chapter 12 we’ll consider ways 
to diagnose problems with a malfunctioning printer. And In Chapter 
13 we’ll explore good mousekeeping and other fixes for the mouse 
and keyboard.
Part IV: Resetting the Operating System
I’ve already posed the question of whether hardware or software is 
supreme. The fact is, though, that if the operating system becomes 
scrambled, the hardware will sit there like a cold pile of silicon and 
metal. In Chapter 14 I begin by explaining how to repair, refresh, and 
sometimes reinstall Windows. In Chapter 15 I help you examine and 
change system configuration. And in Chapter 16 I tell you how to 
restore your computer’s settings back to the condition they were in the 
last time the PC worked properly.

Introduction 
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC
You’ve got a problem; here are solutions that don’t require a soldering 
iron, a doctoral degree, or the bratty neighbor kid. In Chapter 17 I’ll 
show how to start your machine in Safe Mode, an important tool to 
make changes to an injured PC. In Chapter 18 we’ll explore the Device 
Manager and Windows Troubleshooting Wizard, a pair of power tools 
that come with the operating system. Chapter 19 concentrates on fix-
ing the soft side of hard disk drives, including fragmented files, disk 
errors, and other issues. In Chapter 20, I give a just-the-news roundup 
of fixes to common problems in a PC; these tricks of the trade are 
worth the price of admission.
Time to Get Started!
If you’re a methodical type, start at the beginning and read about your 
PC before you attempt to prevent or correct problems. On the other 
hand, if you already know what’s wrong, consult the table of contents 
or the index and jump right in to the section that deals with the 
problem.

ou wouldn’t want a surgeon to operate 
without knowing the pertinent parts of the 
human body — especially if you’re the patient. 
By the same token, you really shouldn’t do sur-
gery on your PC if you don’t know what its 
components are and what they do.
Fortunately, hardware is more modular and 
less costly today than it was in the “good ole 
days,” so most of the repairs or enhancements 
you want to make aren’t necessarily difficult or 
highly technical. You just need to understand 
some basics about your computer’s anatomy, 
and you should be good to go.
Another reason to know these basics: Whether 
or not you ever need to make repairs, under-
standing computer physiology should help you 
get more use out of your PC and make your 
experience with it less frustrating.

Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
This chapter isn’t the Gray’s Anatomy of computers; for that, you need a 
more-in-depth book such as my Fix Your Own PC (Wiley Publishing). 
Think of the chapter as being a form of CliffsNotes — just enough to start 
with — and check out the cross-referenced chapters for more details.
Make a Point: Mice and Other Pointing Devices
A pointing device allows you to move a pointer onscreen to work 
directly with the elements you find there. Your PC may have some 
combination of the following:
 
➟ Mouse: This device gives your computer a hand, in a 
metaphorical sort of way. It’s one of the most intui-
tive elements of a computer, easy to grasp and to 
use. See Chapter 13 for more on mice. You may have 
either of two kinds:
 
• Wired: The most common pointing device is the 
basic mouse (see Figure 1-1), which is about the 
size of a deck of cards. Its two buttons and long 
tail (connection wire) make it look vaguely 
mouselike. Some mice have three buttons or a 
small scroll wheel on top.
 
• Wireless: A wireless mouse has no tail; instead, 
it communicates with the computer via radio-
frequency or infrared waves. You need to keep a 
wireless mouse fed (powered) with batteries.
 
➟ Trackball: Some users prefer a trackball (see Figure 
1-2), which is essentially an upside-down mouse. 
You move the pointer onscreen by spinning the ball.

 The trackball is my preferred pointing device because 
it doesn’t require much desk space and is also easier 
on the wrist and shoulder than a mouse is.
 
➟ Touchpad: Many PCs feature a touchpad, which is a 
matchbook-size, touch-sensitive screen on a laptop 
or a stand-alone device that plugs into a desktop 
computer. You move the pointer onscreen by push-
ing your finger along the touchpad.

Stay on Key: Keyboards and Other Input Devices
 
➟ Keyboard: The keyboard (see Figure 1-3) is the one 
part of a computer that most of us have dealt with 
for nearly all of our lives. (Remember the typewriter? 
Its odd QWERTY layout for the keys is pretty much 
unchanged.) Like mice, keyboards come in two fla-
vors: wired and wireless. I discuss keyboards in more 
detail in Chapter 13.
 
➟ Tablet: A tablet is a flat device — an active touch-
screen (like that on a GPS receiver or an automated 
teller machine) or a metal or plastic pad — that 
allows you to interact with the computer in a way 
that resembles using a paper tablet or notebook. 

➟
13
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Parts You Can See
Although tablet input devices have been around for a 
long time, they’re still used mostly in high-end 
graphics stations and by folks who need to input 
precision drawing or graphics data. If, however, you 
need to input variable data and just like the concept 
of using a penlike stylus to interact with your PC, a 
tablet may be for you.

See Clearly Now: Monitors
In this book, for simplicity’s sake, I use the terms monitor and display 
interchangeably in most descriptions (and cover them interchangeably 
in Chapter 8). Technically, though, the two devices are different:

➟
14
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
 
➟ Monitor: A monitor is a high-resolution television display 
based on a cathode ray tube (CRT). Because of the size 
of the CRT, it tends to be large and heavy. A modern PC 
can support two monitors to provide more workspace 
and to help you separate tasks (see Figure 1-4).
CRT monitor
Dual monitors provide more workspace.
Figure 1-4
 
 A working monitor can be used with most comput-
ers. If you buy a new machine or need to replace a 
failed monitor, however, you’ll probably have to 
switch to a display.

➟
15
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Parts You Can See
 
➟ Display: A display (see Figure 1-5) uses a flat liquid 
crystal diode (LCD) system to show characters and 
graphics. Displays, which arrived with the first lap-
tops, are thinner and lighter than monitors; use less 
electrical power; generate less heat; and may be 
sharper for tired eyes. The newest displays use light-
emitting diodes (LED) instead of an LCD system.
LCD and LED displays are thinner and lighter than CRT monitors.
Figure 1-5
 
 
Given a choice, I’d get an LED display. LED displays 
are more expensive than LCD models, but they last 
longer, use less energy, and run a lot cooler.

➟
16
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
Get the Picture (and Sound): Cameras, 
Speakers, and Microphones
 
➟ Speakers: Laptop computers generally have little 
speakers built into their cases; desktop machines 
offer connectors for external audio equipment. (For 
more information about these connectors, see 
“Connect the Parts: Ports and Hubs,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
 To get the best sound from your computer, you 
should use speakers that have their own amplifier.
 
➟ Microphone: A computer’s microphone (usually 
built in) allows you to chime in with your own nar-
ration or participate in online conference calls. For 
some users, a microphone can serve as a replacement 
for, or an enhancement to, a keyboard as a way to 
enter text and commands.
 
➟ Video camera: Video cameras for computers, called 
Webcams, are both small (some have a lens the size 
of the hole in a Cheerio) and inexpensive, so they’re 
built into most laptops today. If you need to add an 
external Webcam to a desktop PC, you can buy one 
for $25 to $75. Figure 1-6 shows a typical display-
mounted Webcam from Logitech.

Go Online: Modems and Routers
 
➟ Modem: A modem (see Figure 1-7) is an essential 
piece of hardware that allows your PC to communi-
cate with the Internet or with other computers on a 
local network. It can be either built-in or external. 
The appearance, features, and speed of your modem 
depend on what kind of service you use to connect 

➟
18
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
to the Internet or local network: dial-up or digital 
subscriber line (DSL) service from the phone com-
pany, or broadband cable from a cable television 
provider. You can find some maintenance and repair 
tips in Chapter 9.
Lights show connection status.
Figure 1-7
 
➟ Router: A router does what its name says: routes 
information from your computer across a network 
and out to the Internet. If you have only a single 
computer connected to the Internet, you don’t need 
a router; you simply plug your computer directly 
into the modem. If you want to connect more than 
one computer to the Internet, however, you need a 
router to serve as a data traffic cop.

➟
19
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Parts You Can See
 
 Routers come in many flavors. Some are stand-alone 
units; others are built into a wireless access point 
that lets your various computers connect wirelessly 
to the router and from there to the Internet. Figure 
1-8 shows a modern high-speed wireless router.

Figure 1-8
Put It on Paper: Printers
 
➟ Inkjet: Inkjet printers use one or more cartridges 
filled with ink that literally spray images or text onto 
paper. Whether the printed information is text or 
photographs, it consists of tiny dots of ink placed 
very close together. The advantages of inkjet printers 
are size and cost — both small. (You can buy 

➟
20
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
a serviceable inkjet printer for less than $50.) The 
disadvantages include relatively slow speed and high 
ink costs. A high-resolution color printer (the type 
you may use to print photographs) may use four or 
more ink cartridges, and depending on the amount 
of printing you do, the cost of maintaining an inkjet 
printer can be fairly high.
 
 If you’re willing to spend more for a high-end inkjet 
printer, you can get printing speeds of 20 pages per 
minute (or faster) for black and white and 10 to 30 
seconds per page for color. In addition, you can get 
better picture quality than with a consumer-grade 
laser printer.
 
➟ Laser: Laser printers generally cost more than inkjet 
printers, but they can be faster, and operating costs 
are lower. A laser printer uses a laser beam to draw 
characters or images on an electrostatically charged 
drum, which attracts a very fine powder called toner 
and deposits the resulting image onto a piece of 
paper. Finally, the paper is passed through a hot 
fuser roller that melts the image onto the paper, 
making it permanent. 
 
➟ All-in-one: For home or small-business use, consider 
an all-in-one printer (see Figure 1-9). These devices 
incorporate a fax machine, digital scanner, and 
(usually) inkjet printer in a single package. Prices 
are reasonable, and the device combination saves 
desk space. For the greatest flexibility, look for a 
unit that uses a sheet feeder so that you can scan a 
stack of pages or send multiple fax pages 
automatically.

Connect the Parts: Ports and Hubs
 
➟ USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports: These simple 
rectangular connectors (see Figure 1-10) are nearly 
ubiquitous on modern PCs and laptops because 
they can be used to link nearly any type of device. 
A computer may offer a bank of four or six ports, 
which look like tiny pizza ovens.

➟
22
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
USB ports
Figure 1-10
 
 The various versions of USB are downwardly compat-
ible with older hardware, so a USB 2.0 port and cable 
should work with a device designed for USB 1.0, 
although they will exchange information at the 
slower speed of the older equipment. When USB 3.0 
is available in late 2009 or 2010, it will work with 
devices designed for USB 1.0 and 2.0, at their origi-
nal speeds.
 
➟ Ethernet port: An Ethernet cable plugged into this 
port attaches the computer to a local area network or 
high-speed modem. For more on this port, see 
Chapter 2.
 
➟ Ethernet switch: An Ethernet switch (see Figure 
1-11) contains multiple Ethernet ports that connect 
multiple devices — computers, printers, wireless 
access points, and so on — to a network.
 
➟ Hub: Each USB port can connect directly to a single 
device or can be shared with multiple pieces of elec-
tronics by means of a hub, which is a bit like the 
power strip you may have behind your home enter-
tainment system. A USB hub looks and functions 
much like an Ethernet switch. A cable plugged into a 
USB port on the PC connects it with the hub, which 
has two, four, or sometimes more connectors for 
USB cables.

Protect Your PC: Surge Protectors and UPS Devices
 
➟ Surge protector: If a jolt of high voltage gets into 
your computer’s motherboard (see Chapter 2), your 
computer is — to use the technical jargon — fried. 
That’s why every computer (as well as any other 
expensive piece of electronic equipment in your 
home or office) should have a surge protector 
between its plug and the wall outlet. This device 
contains electrical components that can, in most 
circumstances, chop off any sudden spurts of high 
voltage.
 
 In the worst situations, such as a lightning strike or a 
serious malfunction in an electrical line, a surge pro-
tector sacrifices itself like a bodyguard. Its internal 
parts melt to break the electrical circuit. With luck, 
this process happens so fast that the electrical surge 
won’t get into the power supply or beyond.
 
➟ Uninterruptible power supply (UPS): If you want 
the highest level of protection from a power outage, 
consider adding a UPS device (see Figure 1-12) to 
your collection of equipment. This device is essen-
tially a large battery with a bit of electronics to con-
trol its actions.
 
 Your computer plugs into the UPS and draws its 
power from the battery; the UPS plugs into a wall 
socket, using the electrical current to keep topping 
off the battery. If the power goes off briefly or drops 
below ordinary levels momentarily, you should be 
able to keep on working without an interruption. In 
the case of an extended power outage, your com-
puter should be able to use the battery long enough 
to allow you to save any open files and conduct an 
orderly shutdown.

Thinking Inside 
the Box
B
efore you consider what’s inside the box, 
think about the box itself: the case. It 
may lie on its side like a pizza box (this type 
is called a desktop case) or stand upright like a 
filing cabinet (and be known as a tower case). 
Or you may be using a laptop or an integrated 
desktop machine. These configurations 
include the monitor with everything else and 
have unique shapes that depend on the man-
ufacturers’ whims.
However it stands, your case has four impor-
tant assignments:
 ➟ Holding together the internal compo-
nents of the computer and creating a 
frame that allows the installation of cer-
tain features
 ➟ Protecting electrical and other parts from 
damage by dirt, liquids, paper clips, and 
other threats
 ➟ Working with the cooling fan to remove 
the heat that’s generated by the electrical 
circuits and moving parts
 ➟ Keeping radio-frequency radiation inside

Before you get nervous, let me assure you that you may never have to 
open the case of your desktop computer. In the case of a laptop com-
puter, you probably wouldn’t ever want to try, because it’s not easy. 
This chapter just shows you what you would see if you were to per-
form a bit of exploratory surgery.
Assemble Your Toolkit
 
➟ Screwdrivers: Most jobs require a single small 
Phillips-head (X-shaped) screwdriver; others call for 
a small and a medium-size flat-blade screwdriver.
 
 Some technicians prefer a ratchet-style driver that 
allows you to install or remove a screw by rotating 
your wrist; this design may reduce the chance that 
the screwdriver will slip out of the screw head. Also, 
a magnetized screwdriver helps you hold on to the 
screw while it’s going into or coming out of the case.
 
 If you use a magnetized tool, avoid getting it close to 
your hard drive and other electronic components; 
they don’t like magnets very much!
 
➟ Antistatic strap: I recommend using an antistatic 
strap, similar to the one shown in Figure 2-1. You 
can buy one for a dollar or two, often from the same 
place where you buy computer parts. For details on 
using an antistatic strap, see “Get Grounded,” later in 
this chapter.
 
➟ Stable work surface: To do the job right, you need a 
sturdy, well-lighted workspace with enough elbow 
room for you and some additional space to hold any 
parts you remove.
 
➟ Writing materials, labels, and containers: Put in 
place a notepad, a pencil or a plastic pen, and a set 
of numbered or marked containers (an empty egg 
carton works quite well).

➟
29
 Chapter 2: Thinking Inside the Box
Antistatic wrist strap
Figure 2-1
 
 You don’t have to use a plastic pen, but when work-
ing around sensitive electronic equipment, it’s always 
best to avoid the chance of shorting components 
with anything metal.
 
 As you remove screws, clips, or cables, make notes 
about where particular screws used to reside and in 
which marked containers you placed them. Use the 
labels to identify all cables and connectors on your 
computer.

➟
30
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
 
➟ Camera: Almost everyone has a digital or video cam-
era. Put it to work by making a full set of images of 
the interior of your computer before you make any 
changes. If you run into trouble later while reinstall-
ing parts or end up with an orphan screw, you 
should be able to figure out the solution by pressing 
Play on your camera.
Get Grounded
 
 
Always use one of the techniques in this section to 
ground yourself before touching your computer’s 
sensitive electronics; otherwise, you could create a 
damaging short. Here’s what you absolutely do not 
want to do: Scuffle across a carpeted floor in your 
socks and then reach into the innards of your com-
puter. That’s one of the best ways to deliver a static 
shock that could blow the mind of your PC.
 
➟ Use an antistatic strap. Place the antistatic strap 
around one of your wrists. It usually interferes least 
if you put it on your nondominant arm (left arm for 
righties, right arm for lefties). Then connect the wire 
on the strap to a cold-water pipe, or tape it — metal 
to metal — to the center screw of a three-hole electri-
cal outlet.
 
 
Be careful not to put the wire in one of the holes 
meant for an electrical plug.
 
➟ Use a desktop antistatic device. You can install an 
antistatic device such as the touchpad shown in 
Figure 2-2, or buy a keyboard mat or antistatic touch 
strip.

➟
31
 Chapter 2: Thinking Inside the Box
Touch this antistatic pad before touching your computer.
Figure 2-2
 
➟ Discharge your body’s static into a metal object. If 
you don’t use an antistatic strap or device, position 
your chair close to a cold-water pipe or the center 
screw of an electrical outlet; when you’re seated and 
ready to begin work, touch the pipe or screw to dis-
charge your body’s static electricity into it. If you 
can’t do that, seat yourself, touch something metal 
and substantial, and then stay where you are without 
moving around.

➟
32
Part I: A Computer Is Not a Toaster 
 
 In most cases, simply touching the outside of the 
computer case before you touch any of the internal 
components is enough to bring your body to the 
same electrical potential as the component you’ll 
touch next.
Open the Computer’s Case
 
 
PCs come in dozens of designs, so spending a few 
moments studying the instruction manual first may 
be helpful.
 
1. Place your computer on the work surface, with your 
tools, writing materials, and parts containers at hand.
 
2. Unplug the computer’s power cord, and label and 
remove all other cables and power connectors.
 
3. Ground yourself (see “Get Grounded,” earlier in this 
chapter).
 
4. Open the case.
 
• Clamshell case: If your computer’s case is a clam-
shell design, it opens like a book when you release 
one or two latches or clips; no tools are required 
(see Figure 2-3).
 
• Upright tower case: Lay it on its side so that the 
motherboard is face up and parallel with your 
working surface. Then remove the connecting 
screws or clips, placing them in one of the labeled 
containers on your work surface.

➟
33
 Chapter 2: Thinking Inside the Box

Figure 2-3
 
 You’ll have to inspect your computer case to deter-
mine how to orient it. Most cases are built as a box 
with a top that’s removable when the computer is on 
its side, so put the deep side down and remove the 
plate on top. If your case has two removable sides, 
the proper orientation probably is with the power sup-
ply down on the work surface. (The power supply is 
behind the fan opening on the rear of the case; also 
see Step 5.)
 
5. With the cover removed, examine the inside of the com-
puter (see Figure 2-4). You should be able to spot three 
major components easily:

• Power supply: A sealed metal case holds the 
power supply. On the outside of the case is the 
incoming connector for the AC cord, and within 
the case is a thicket of cables (usually black, white, 
red, and yellow) and connectors. For more on the 
power supply, see “Tour the Computer’s 
Infrastructure,” later in this chapter.

• Microprocessor: The microprocessor is easy to 
locate because of a fan, heat sink, or sometimes a 
plastic tunnel intended to move cooling air over 
its top and out a vent. I describe it in more detail 
in the next section.
 
• Motherboard: The flat motherboard (see the next 
section for more info) holds dozens of chips and 
connectors, including a set of long slots for upright 
memory modules. Most motherboards have two or 
four such slots, which are usually black with a set 
of plastic lockdown/ejector clips at each end. In 
Figure 2-5, slots 2 and 4 have memory installed, 
latched in place with clips; slots 1 and 3 show 
memory modules partially inserted.

Find Out What Makes Your Computer Think
 
➟ Motherboard: In a modern PC, the motherboard has 
two principal purposes:
 
• Providing electrical and communication wiring to 
sockets that hold the central processing unit (CPU) 
and chipset
 
• Managing the bus — a device that connects the 
computer’s brain to its memory, storage devices, 
and input/output ports
 
➟ Microprocessor: Sometimes called the CPU or just 
the processor, this chip is the brain of the computer. 
Within this small chip are hundreds of millions of 
tiny circuits that switch on or off to move or manip-
ulate bits of data. In modern PCs, most microproces-
sors are made by Intel or AMD. Figure 2-6 shows an 
Intel Core 2 Quad microprocessor.
 
 Although it’s theoretically possible to take out the 
microprocessor in your computer and replace it with 
a faster or more capable unit, you may find that the 
new brain won’t match the personality (see the next 
paragraph). Also, this transplant may not make eco-
nomic sense.

➟
37
 Chapter 2: Thinking Inside the Box
Figure 2-6
 
➟ Chipset: If the microprocessor is the computer’s 
brain, the chipset is its personality. The specialized 
chips hold instructions that manage the computer’s 
ability to (among other things) draw graphics 
onscreen; play music through speakers; and react to 
input from the keyboard, mouse, or other device.

microprocessor.

➟ Hard drive: A computer’s hard drive is essentially a very 
fancy record player. It may have more than one platter 
(think of platters as records — see Figure 2-8), and it 
can work with data recorded on either side and on 
more than one platter. Hard drives are inside a sealed 
case because the read/write head (also shown in Figure 
2-8) floats or flies like an airplane wing just a few thou-
sandths of an inch above the rotating disk within. The 
tiniest piece of dust or bagel crumb would look like an 
iceberg in the path of the Titanic, and the result would 
be similar: a disastrous loss of computer life.

➟ Optical disk drive (CD or DVD): Optical drives can 
come in three designs:
 
• Read: Like the CD player you may have in your 
car or a DVD player in the rec room, this type of 
device can only play back the contents of the disc.
 
• Read/write: A read/write drive, often referred to as 
a CD-R or DVD-R drive, can play back a disc and 
also burn data to a recordable blank disc for later 
retrieval and use.
 
• Read/write/rewritable: This type of drive, called a 
CD-RW or DVD-RW drive, can play back, write, 
erase, and rewrite data on the disc.

➟ Flash memory: Flash memory uses external devices 
called USB flash drives, memory sticks, memory 
cards, or memory keys (similar to the one shown in 
Figure 2-10) to store information. I use flash mem-
ory devices to transfer files between computers that 
aren’t connected and also to make temporary back-
ups of files. Flash memory is also used in digital 
cameras, cellphones, and portable music players.

➟ Power supply: An essential part of any desktop PC is 
the power supply (see Figure 2-11), which converts 
electricity coming from a wall outlet from AC (alter-
nating current) to DC (direct current) and reduces 
the voltage from 120 or 240 volts (depending on 
where you live or work) to the smaller requirements 
of your machine. Under the case of your PC, the 
power supply usually sits in its own sealed gray or 
black metal box. Wall current comes in through a 
cord and goes out of the power supply in a series of 
colored wires that connect to the motherboard, 
memory, storage, and other devices.
 
➟ Cooling system: A computer’s cooling (or thermal 
energy dissipation) system may be easier to under-
stand if you just call it the fan. The processor inside 
the computer, its memory, and the motors that spin 
the hard drive and optical drive all produce heat, 
which can damage components, so designers have to 
dump the heat to the outside.

 Most modern PCs have an intake hole on the front 
of the case and an exhaust port on the back, with 
one or more fans that draw air through the system to 
flow over the hot spots. Mazelike baffles at the 
entrances and exits allow air to pass through but 
block radio-frequency radiation from escaping. Your 
computer may have only one fan that’s integrated 
into the power supply, or it may have multiple fans 
inside the case. Figure 2-12 shows a cooling fan for a 
Pentium microprocessor.

 Never place a computer flat against a wall or other 
solid object that would block the air ports and cause 
the machine to overheat. Every few months, use a 
vacuum to clear dust out of the air intakes and exits.
 
➟ External ports: Just like their maritime counterparts, 
computer ports are designed for coming and going 
traffic. Think of them as doorways for data. A typical 
set of external ports, shown in Figure 2-13, provides 
links to a keyboard and mouse, to external USB 
devices (such as a hard drive or flash memory key), 
and to an Ethernet network.
 
 On older desktop computers, the back or side panels 
are jammed with rows of specialized connectors 
(for a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and so on) and 
several multipurpose ports for things like modems, 
printers, scanners, and external storage. Today’s PCs 
dispense with most of these ports, using advanced 
multipurpose connectors. Most modern computers 
can connect to just about anything through a set of 
USB ports.
 
➟ Internal ports: Inside the case, you’ll find ports on 
the motherboard that connect to the external ports 
or attach the internal hard drive to the motherboard.

Looking Through 
Windows and 
Other Software
C
omputers have two major types of compo-
nents: hardware and software. I discuss the 
hardware side in Chapter 2. In this chapter, I 
cover basic software that can help you under-
stand how your computer operates and fix 
some things that may go wrong.
Windows includes several applications that 
you’ll probably use regularly to manage your 
PC and fix operational issues. You find many 
of these applications in Control Panel, a win-
dow on the innards of your computer where 
you can twiddle with the dials and throw a few 
switches while the machine is running. No screw-
drivers or pliers are required.
You’ll also want (and need) several third-party 
software packages to help you with everything 
from office work such as word processing and 
spreadsheet design to scanning, photography, 
and other tasks that you’ll want to perform as 
you find out more about your computer.

you can choose a new desktop background from the 
images installed with Windows or use your own art or 
photograph (the Desktop tab in XP, or the Personalization 
screen in Vista and Windows 7). You can do the same 
with the screen saver (Windows screen savers or your 
own images).
 
 Vista and Windows 7 handle these display settings 
significantly differently from Windows XP, but the 
basic concept is the same. Instead of a tabbed dis-
play, Vista gives you menu choices in the 
Personalization display, which you will find under 
Appearance and Personalization in the Category

Y
ou have a choice: Leave your operating sys-

them to regular updates. In theory, you might 
be safe never updating Windows if
 ➟ You never add software.
 ➟ You never make any hardware changes, 
using your PC in the same condition in 
which it was delivered from the factory.
 ➟ You never connect to the Internet or to 
any other computer over a local area 
network.
 ➟ You never accept a file from another user 
on a CD, DVD, or other device.
If you have that sort of hermetically sealed 
machine, though, you’re missing out on much 
of the fun and productivity that come from 
making connections. What’s more, your PC’s 
operating system and its software programs 
may fall behind the times. Without updates, 
you won’t benefit from improvements, bug 
fixes, and new defenses against virus and mal-
ware attacks.

Sometimes, you also need to update or even replace device drivers — 
small collections of programming code that interpret commands 
between Windows and devices inside or outside the PC. Drivers some-
times get damaged by things such as electrical spikes, hard disk prob-
lems, or computer viruses.
In this chapter, I show you how to care for Windows and other software.
Check for Windows Updates Manually
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel, and look for the Windows 
Update icon in the far-left column of the Control Panel 
window. (In Vista, you see the words “Check for 
updates.” In 7, you must choose the icon view first.) It 
appears there in both Classic View, which displays all the 
available major utilities as separate icons, and Category 
View, which groups icons of similar types. (See Chapter 3 
for more information about Control Panel’s views.)
 
2. What you do next depends on your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Double-click Windows Update.
 
• Vista: Click Check for Updates (see Figure 4-1).
  
• Windows 7: If you’re viewing Control Panel in 
Classic View, click the Windows Update icon. If 
you’re in Classic View, click System and Security; 
then click Windows Update in the resulting list.
 
 Whichever method you use, a Microsoft Update Web 
page appears when system updates are available for your 
computer.
 
 Different versions of Windows present slightly differ-
ent update pages. In general, however, the update 
software goes directly to the Internet, checks for 
updates to your system, and then tells you whether 
updates are available.

2. Double-click the Automatic Updates icon (see Figure 4-3).
 
3. Choose one of the available options:
 
• Automatic Updates: Microsoft recommends this 
option, which is marked by a friendly green shield 
with a checkmark. If you select this option, you 
can set your computer to communicate with the 
Microsoft mothership automatically on a particu-
lar day of the week or every day, as well as tell it 
what time of day to look for updates.

➟
71
 Chapter 4: Taking Care of Software

➟
72
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
 Most users should select this option. I suggest that 
you schedule daily checks for updates at a time when 
you’re least likely to be interrupted.
 
• Download Updates for Me, but Let Me Choose 
When to Install Them: This option allows you to 
look at the list of suggested updates that Microsoft 
sends your way and accept or reject them 
individually.
 
 Remember to check the notification icon in the noti-
fication area of the Windows desktop and initiate 
putting any new software in place. If you don’t, the 
updates will be on your computer but won’t be 
installed in Windows.
 
• Notify Me but Don’t Automatically Download or 
Install Them: If you choose this option, Microsoft 
sends the updates that it thinks your computer 
needs. Read the list, choose the updates you want, 
and then initiate installation.
 
• Turn Off Automatic Updates: This option is deco-
rated with a red shield filled with an X as a warn-
ing. Microsoft advises that your computer will be 
vulnerable unless you install updates regularly. 
When Automatic Updates is off, it’s up to you to 
visit Windows Update on your own (see “Check 
for Windows Updates Manually,” earlier in this 
chapter). This option is not recommended for 
general use.
 
 About once or twice in each operating system’s life 
cycle, Microsoft offers a major package of updates 
and revisions called a Service Pack, which is about as 
close to a completely new version of Windows as you 
can get. I cover checking for and installing Service 
Pack updates later in this chapter.

➟
73
 Chapter 4: Taking Care of Software
Update Other Software
 
1. If you haven’t already, register all of your applications 
with their manufacturers. It’s best to do this when you 
first install the software on your computer.
 
2. Choose your update preference:
 
• Automatic: Some third-party programs offer regu-
lar automatic updates that last until a new version 
of the program is released or for a specific period. 
Antivirus and Internet security programs, for exam-
ple, typically come set up to receive updates that 
are sent on a regular schedule or whenever new 
threats are discovered. You may see an update 
notice in your taskbar.
 
• Manual: If you decide not to get automatic 
updates or don’t have that option, train yourself to 
get on a regular schedule of checking to see 
whether updates are being offered. While your PC 
is connected to the Internet, click the program’s 
“check for updates” link (usually in a Help menu) 
to go online and check for available updates, as 
shown in Figure 4-4. Then follow the onscreen 
instructions.
 
 Nearly all software manufacturers assume that users 
have access to high-speed Internet connections, so 
they deliver updates online. A few companies offer to 
ship a CD or DVD with updates (and may charge 
you for that special service).
 
3. Install any required updates. In addition to fixing bugs, 
required updates may add compatibility with new file 
formats or keep the software in step with changes in 
Windows.

➟
74
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
In McAfee, click this link to check for updates manually.
Figure 4-4
 
4. Decide whether to install optional updates, which are . . . 
well, optional. They may address minor issues that may 
not apply to your system or to the tasks you perform, or 
they may add some functions that you don’t need or 
want. Read the updates’ descriptions as well as system 
requirements, and make your own decision about 
whether to put them on your computer.
Check Your Service Pack Status
 
1. Choose Start➪Run to open the Run dialog box. In Vista 
and Windows 7 type it into the search box.
 
2. Type winver and then click OK.

➟
75
 Chapter 4: Taking Care of Software
 
 The resulting dialog box shows what version of Windows 
you’re running and which Service Pack is installed.
 
 Cautious users, including me, usually put off install-
ing a Service Pack for a few weeks after it’s released to 
the public; I prefer to allow other people to try it first 
and look for any major incompatibilities. To take this 
course, you’ll have to conduct manual updates (see 
“Check for Windows Updates Manually,” earlier in 
this chapter), because Windows will install Service 
Packs for you automatically as part of the update 
process.
Check for and Install Service Pack Updates
 
1. Open Internet Explorer.
 
2. Go to http://update.microsoft.com.
 
3. Click Express (Recommended).
 
 If you don’t have the latest Service Pack installed, 
Windows will display a dialog box similar to the one 
shown in Figure 4-5.
 
 If you haven’t updated Windows in a while, you may 
have additional software to install before you can 
install the Service Pack. Follow any onscreen 
instructions.
 
4. Close all running programs.
 
5. Click the Install button to start the installation.

Fix Corrupted Program Files
It may be a dirty little secret among computer users, but your program 
files and other data can become corrupted and dysfunctional through 
no direct fault of your own. If you practice good hardware mainte-
nance and back up your working hard drives regularly, the chance of 
suffering corrupted files is small. Fortunately, if your files do become 
corrupted (and they probably will, if you use your computer long 
enough), you have a way to recover.
 
1. Close the offending program, if it’s running.
 
2. Choose Start➪Control Panel to open the Control Panel 
window.
 
3. Follow the instructions in “Uninstall a Misbehaving 
Program When All Else Fails,” later in this chapter. You’ll 
be asked to choose the program from a list.
Fix Corrupted Device Drivers
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel to open the Control Panel 
window.
 
2. Follow the appropriate step for your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Double-click the System icon; then 
click the Hardware tab in the resulting dialog box, 
and choose Device Manager.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Click System and Security 
(in Windows 7) or System and Maintenance (in 
Vista); then choose System➪Device Manager.

5. Click the Update Driver button.
 
6. Follow the onscreen instructions to help Windows find a 
driver for the selected hardware. You may be asked to use 
the installation CD or DVD that came with your hard-
ware. If you have it, use it; if you don’t, Windows will go 
online to search the Internet for the proper driver.

➟
81
 Chapter 4: Taking Care of Software
 
 You probably can update the driver yourself, direct 
from the source. Go to the manufacturer’s support 
Web page and enter the model of your hardware, and 
you’re likely to be able to download a self-installing 
driver. When you take this approach, you may get 
additional software, such as (in the case of a camera 
or scanner) a photo-editing application.
Uninstall a Misbehaving Program When All Else Fails
You have three ways to remove a program from a computer running 
Windows. The first two methods usually work well; the third is dan-
gerous and not recommended.
 
➟ Windows utility: Use the Add or Remove Programs 
utility (Windows XP) or the Uninstall or Change a 
Program utility (Vista and Windows 7).
 
 
Not all programs that you install on your computer 
make use of this utility.
  
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel to open the Control 
Panel window.
 
2. Follow the appropriate step for your version of 
Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Double-click the Add or Remove 
Programs icon to open the Add or Remove 
Programs window.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Click the Programs and 
Features icon to open the Programs and Features 
window (see Figure 4-9).

4. Click whatever uninstall button the program provides 
(such as Change, Remove, Change/Remove, or 
Uninstall/Change; see Figure 4-10), and follow any 
onscreen instructions.
 
5. Follow any onscreen instructions.
 
6. Restart your computer if you’re prompted to do so.
 
➟ Manufacturer utility: Use a specialized Remove or 
Uninstall utility that the program’s installer put on 
your computer along with the software program.

➟
83
 Chapter 4: Taking Care of Software
Click Remove to delete the selected program in Windows XP.
Figure 4-10
 
 In some cases, you may have to find an uninstall util-
ity on the CD or DVD that you used to install the 
program, or you may have to download an uninstall 
utility from the manufacturer’s Web site.
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs (or Programs) to display a 
list of all the programs on your PC.
 
2. Select the program you want to uninstall. If you see a 
right-pointing arrow next to its name, multiple 
options are available; place the mouse pointer on the 
arrow to expand the menu, and choose the uninstall 
option.

➟
84
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
3. Follow any onscreen instructions.
 
4. Restart your computer if you’re prompted to do so.
 
➟ Manual deletion: Delete the program from your 
hard drive manually; then search for and remove all 
its interconnections with Windows and other 
programs.
 
 Brute-force removal of components is not recom-
mended — at least, not for an unassisted amateur. 
Merely deleting a program from your hard disk 
doesn’t remove all its interconnections with other 
applications and may do more harm than good.

Practicing 
Good Computer 
Hygiene
T
he best repair is the one you don’t have to 
make. If you can keep your computer up to 
date and in tune, you and your PC will live 
happier, more productive lives.
The best defense against aging or sudden death 
is keeping your computer cool, calm, and col-
lected. By that, I mean ensuring that it doesn’t 
overheat; that it’s protected from electrical 
surges; that the logical parts are efficiently 
organized; and that the programs aren’t scram-
bled, garbled, or improperly altered.
In this chapter, I talk about preventive and 
diagnostic measures that help you keep your 
computer in good health and spot problems 
before they become serious. Think of this 
chapter as providing vitamin pills, medical 
scans, and a safe deposit box for your PC.

and press Enter.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Click the Start button, type 
msconfig in the Search Programs and Files field at 
the bottom of the screen, and press Enter; then 
click Msconfig in the resulting list.
 
 Whichever method you use, the System Configuration 
dialog box opens (see Figure 5-1).
Click a tab to view related settings.
Figure 5-1
 
2. Select Diagnostic Startup on the General tab and then 
click OK. The System Configuration utility takes a few 
moments to disable all but the most necessary applica-
tions that run at startup; then it displays a Restart 
dialog box.

➟

 Chapter 5: Practicing Good Computer Hygiene
 
3. Click Restart to restart your computer in diagnostic 
mode. In Windows XP, you see a message reminding you 
that diagnostic mode is active. In Vista and Windows 7, 
note the change in the Start button; the text-only button 
indicates diagnostic mode.
 
4. Click OK to close the message and launch System 
Configuration. In Vista and Windows 7 you have to 
relaunch this utility as described above.
 
5. Leave the utility running, and test your system.
 
 
Some things, such as custom Internet Explorer tool-
bars, may not run during testing because the System 
Configuration utility disables them.
 
6. Click the Services tab, and scroll through the list of soft-
ware services that run each time your computer starts, 
looking for suspect applications: those from unknown 
manufacturers or those with names that don’t seem to fit 
anything you’re using.
 
 
Most of the services in this list will show the manu-
facturer as Microsoft, and most of them will be dis-
abled. You can probably ignore those services.
 
7. Make only one change at a time.
 
8. On the General tab of the System Configuration dialog 
box, select Normal Startup, and click OK. When your com-
puter restarts, see whether you’ve corrected the problem.
 
9. If the problem persists, repeat Steps 1–8, adding new 
applications one at a time. If the problem returns after 
you add an application, you’ve found the software that is 
causing it. Contact the manufacturer, or download an 
update from the Internet.
 
10. Click the Startup tab (see Figure 5-2), and conduct a sim-
ilar inspection and test.

System Configuration is a useful tool that may help 
you uncover problems and certainly will give you 
information about your system. Use it cautiously, 
however. I recommend that you stay away from the 
.INI tab in Windows XP and the Boot and Services 
tabs in Vista and Windows; you could change some-
thing on these tabs that would make your computer 
unusable.
Run Microsoft Office Diagnostics

grams you don’t use or to remove System Restore files.
 
 You should remove System Restore files (see Chapter 
16) and shadow copies only if you’re desperate for 
hard drive space. These files can help you get your 
system back to normal if the current installation files 
become damaged or your configuration gets out of 
whack.
 
6. Click OK to start the cleanup process.
 
7. When Windows asks you whether you’re sure that you 
want to delete these files, click Yes.
 
 You should run Disk Cleanup before you run the 
Disk Defragmenter utility (see the next section) so 
the regained disk space will be defragmented too.
Defragment Your Hard Drive
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories.
 
2. Select System Tools, and click Disk Defragmenter to open 
the Disk Defragmenter dialog box (see Figure 5-5).
 
• Vista and Windows 7: This dialog box automati-
cally shows you the percentage of fragmentation 
on the selected hard drive; proceed to Step 3.
 
• Windows XP: Click the Analyze Disk button to 
display a complete report on your hard drive, 
including the percentage of fragmentation; then 
proceed to Step 3.

➟

3. Check the fragmentation report to decide whether you 
need to defragment the selected drive. A drive with 10 
percent or more fragmentation should be defragmented. 
(If you’ve been using your computer for a while, the 
drive may show 50 percent fragmentation or more.)
 
4. To defragment the selected drive, quit any other running 
programs and then click the Defragment Disk button. 
This process can be lengthy, and you really shouldn’t be 
running any other software while Defragmenter works, 
because you could be creating and saving files while the 
utility is trying to consolidate them.

 In Windows XP, you have to remember to run the 
Defragmenter utility periodically. In Vista and 
Windows 7, by default, the utility runs automatically 
on all connected hard drives once a week. To set your 
own defragmentation schedule, click the Configure 
Schedule button in the Disk Defragmenter dialog box.
Test for Chinks in the Security Armor
 
 You can find lots of free security tools online. I rec-
ommend ShieldsUP!, which sends a series of probes 
to see which ports (think of them as doors; see 
Chapter 2) are open on your computer and what details 
you’re telling the world about yourself or your personal 
and business secrets. This tool won’t fix the problems 
that it finds, but it will give you some indication of 
whether the security program you have installed is 
doing an adequate job or needs adjustment.
 
1. Point your Web browser to the Gibson Research Web site 
at www.grc.com.
 
2. Click the ShieldsUP! logo.
 
3. In the resulting page, scroll down to and click the 
ShieldsUP! link.
 
4. Review the opening screen, which shows you the infor-
mation about your Internet connection that’s presented 
when you visit a Web site.

Keep Things Cool
 
➟ Check the vents. Make certain that the intake and 
exhaust vents on your computer aren’t blocked. Most 
vents are on the back of the computer; if you have a 
PC with that design, don’t place the back of it flush 
against a wall or curtains.
 
➟ Clean the vents. Every few months, use a handheld 
vacuum to remove dust buildup on the intake and 
exhaust vents.

➟
96
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
➟ Check airflow. Once a week (more often if your 
computer starts to crash or otherwise becomes unre-
liable), check the flow of air coming out of your 
computer by placing your hand near the vent. The 
air should feel warm but not painfully hot. If you 
don’t feel air coming out of the exhaust vent, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Visually inspect the fan housing on the back of your 
computer (see Chapter 2). If the fan isn’t turning, the 
motor may be bad, or a power connector may be 
unplugged. If the fan is turning, but little or no air is 
coming out, something may be clogging the air path.
 
2. Shut down the computer.
 
3. Unplug the power cord and any other cables that 
could block your access inside the computer.
 
4. Place the computer on a sturdy, well-lighted work 
surface, and open the case (see Chapter 2). See this 
book’s information about grounding yourself.
 
5. If the fan wasn’t turning in Step 1, make sure that its 
power connector is attached securely. If it isn’t, fix the 
connection. If the connection’s already secure, you 
probably need a new fan. Contact a computer repair 
facility.
 
6. Carefully feel for hot spots, and look for blockages in 
the thermal tunnel that runs (in most modern cases) 
from the front to the rear of the unit (see Figure 5-8).
 
7. Use a vacuum cleaner or a small, clean paintbrush to 
remove dust inside the case. Pay particular attention 
to the louvers around the outside of the case where air 
is supposed to enter the enclosure.

➟
97
 Chapter 5: Practicing Good Computer Hygiene
Check both ends of this tunnel for dust, which could restrict airflow.
Figure 5-8
 
 You should keep the inside and outside of your com-
puter case clean, but the components are delicate. 
Use caution with a vacuum cleaner or brush! You 
don’t want to disconnect any wires or damage 
anything.
 
8. Look for additional fans. Many computers have multi-
ple cooling fans, and they all need to work to provide 
proper cooling.
 
9. Close the case, and hook everything back up.
 
10. Turn on the computer, and recheck airflow.
 
➟ Check the fans. Look and listen to determine 
whether the power-supply fan and any auxiliary fans 
are running. If small auxiliary fans have stopped 
working, you should replace them; if the power-
supply fan isn’t working, you should replace the 
entire power-supply unit. See Chapter 9 for details 
on both procedures.

➟

Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
Mind Your Monitor
 
➟ Use a surge protector. Never plug your display 
directly into wall current. Instead, be sure to use a 
good-quality surge protector (see Chapter 1). 
Damage caused by an electrical spike ordinarily isn’t 
covered by manufacturer warranties.
 
➟ Keep the air vents open. Never cover the air vents on 
the top or sides of a monitor. Doing so could result 
in a dangerous buildup of heat that could damage 
components or shorten their lives. Periodically, use a 
new paintbrush or the brush attachment of a vacuum 
cleaner to remove accumulated dust on the monitor’s 
ventilation holes.
 
➟ Leave it on. The most dangerous moment in an elec-
tronic component’s life is when power is first applied, 
and the component goes from cold and uncharged to 
warm and full of electricity. Avoid turning your moni-
tor on and off more than necessary. You can reduce 
power consumption by following these steps:
 
1. Right-click your desktop, and choose Properties 
(Windows XP) or Personalize (Vista and Windows 7) 
from the shortcut menu.
 
2. Follow the appropriate step for your version of 
Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Click the Screen Saver tab of the 
Properties dialog box.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Click the Screen Saver tab 
of the Personalize dialog box; then click Change 
Power Settings.
 
 Whichever method you use, you see the dialog box 
shown in Figure 5-9.

Click to set the time delay.
Figure 5-9
 
3. Click Choose When to Turn Off the Display to set the 
time delay before Windows turns off your monitor. 
You also can set system sleep delay and some other 
options in this dialog box.
 
 Vista and Windows 7 have preprogrammed power-
saving settings. You can accept one of these settings 
or customize the times.
 
➟ Check the connections. Make sure that the cable 
between the monitor and the video card is firmly 
attached at each end and not crimped or pinched. If 
you need to make adjustments, follow these steps:

➟
100
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
1. If your monitor has a removable cable, unplug it and 
then replug it into the receptacle on the monitor (see 
Figure 5-10). This step could reset a loose connection 
and remove corrosion on any of the connectors.
Unplug and reset all cables.
Figure 5-10
  
2. Unplug and reconnect the monitor cable at the com-
puter end. You may have to use a screwdriver or 
thumbscrew to unlock the connection before you can 
unplug it. Use these locking screws when you replug 
the cable.
 
➟ Klutzproof it. Be sure that the monitor is safely 
installed on a sturdy desk, with its cable properly out 
of tripping range of passersby. I don’t have to warn 
you about placing cups of coffee or soda anywhere 
in the vicinity, right?

 Chapter 5: Practicing Good Computer Hygiene
Pamper Your Printer
 
➟ Keep it squeaky-clean. Read the instructions that 
come with your printer, and follow the recom-
mended cleaning cycles.
 
• Inkjet printers: For an inkjet, cleaning usually 
involves keeping the nozzles clear through regular 
use or by running a built-in cleaning program.
 
 If you don’t expect to use an inkjet printer for several 
months, you may want to remove the ink cartridge 
(or each ink cartridge, in the case of color printers) 
and store it in a closed case so that it won’t dry out. 
Figure 5-11 shows a typical inkjet printer with 
instructions for changing cartridges under the lid.
Open your printer case, and follow the directions for replacing cartidges.
Figure 5-11

➟
102
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
• Laser printers: Follow the manufacturer’s cleaning 
instructions, which may include careful vacuuming 
of the interior of the machine, and keep the inter-
nal drum away from direct sunlight and extreme 
temperatures.
 
➟ Control the humidity. Many printers are prone to 
paper jams and quality problems in times of high 
humidity.
 
 One solution for the summertime blues: Keep your 
paper in a sealed plastic box, and load it into the 
printer tray only when it’s needed.

Keeping Intruders 
out of Your 
Computer
H
ow can a box of metal, silicon, and plastic 
parts be laid low? Consider the following 
ills that computers are heir to:
 ➟ Viruses: A computer virus or other con-
dition that falls under the broad term 
malware is an infection that takes over 
Windows or another program, making 
your computer do something you don’t 
want it to do.
 ➟ Spyware: Spyware, which is another form 
of malware, hides on your computer and 
watches everything on it: the Web sites 
you visit, your login names and pass-
words for banking, even the text you 
compose for e-mails and instant 
messages.
 ➟ Phishing (pronounced fishing): This elec-
tronic con game tricks computer users 
into revealing valuable information such 
as bank account or credit card numbers. 
The most common form is an e-mail that 
appears to come from your bank or credit 
card company, asking you to update your 
account or provide additional information.

you to the risk of downloading malware.
In this chapter, I give you pointers on defending your PC from all 
these security breaches.
 Play Smart Defense
 
➟ Be legal. Buy and use only legal copies of all soft-
ware on your computer, and register your name and 
e-mail address with the makers. To put it another 
way, don’t buy or use bootleg copies of software, and 
be very cautious about using software offered by 
companies or people you don’t know and trust.
 
➟ Stay current. Keep all software up to date, installing 
updates and patches as the manufacturer releases them. 
(For details on updating software, see Chapter 4.)
 
➟ Install security. Install a capable antivirus or com-
prehensive security package, and use it regularly to 
scan your computer (see “Check for Viruses,” later in 
this chapter).
 
 Your Internet service provider may offer antivirus or 
security protection as part of your service package. 
Comcast, for example, offers the McAfee antivirus 
program (see Figure 6-1).

 If you prefer, you can use a separate firewall product 
or one that’s built into a third-party security program. 
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions about using 
the firewall product on a PC that also has Windows 
Firewall installed.
Check for Viruses
 
 If your computer doesn’t have a capable, up-to-date 
antivirus or broader Internet security program, stop 
reading right now. Go get one of these programs, 
install it, and give your computer a full scan. Be sure 
to follow the instructions carefully. Some manufac-
turers set up their antivirus products so that they scan 
your system before they’re installed; others take over 
after they’re in place.
 
1. Make sure that you always have the latest updates for 
your antivirus or security program. Some programs check 
for and download updates automatically based on a 
schedule that you set. You can always check for updates 
manually as long as you do so regularly (see Figure 6-4).
 
2. Every week or so, use the program to scan your computer 
for viruses.
 
 Run the program any time things suddenly go strange 
on your computer — if files are missing or renamed, 
for example, or if your Internet home page has 
changed without your knowledge. Do this even if 
you scanned your PC recently, because viruses can 
attack at any time.
 
3. If your computer’s antivirus or Internet security program 
displays an ominous warning, follow the onscreen 
instructions carefully to remove or quarantine the threat. 
Many security-software makers offer specific tools for 
removing particular virus strains that broke out into the 
wild despite precautions by computer users.

➟ Inspect e-mail before opening it. Pay attention to 
the details of an e-mail before you open it. Be espe-
cially cautious about e-mails that are addressed to 
undisclosed-recipients or to a name you 
don’t recognize, and about e-mails that have a blank 
or odd Subject line. Anything you receive by e-mail 
that seems too good to be true probably is (see 
Figure 6-5).

➟
111
 Chapter 6: Keeping Intruders out of Your Computer
E-mail that’s not addressed to you personally means 
spam at least and possibly something more nefarious
Figure 6-5
 
 If you receive an e-mail from someone you don’t 
know, the best thing to do is delete it without open-
ing it. Also, never follow a link in an e-mail unless 
you’re sure where it goes.
 
➟ Be wary of attachments. Never open an attachment 
to an e-mail or to an instant message (IM) unless 
you know and trust the source — and even then, ask 
yourself whether the risk is worth the reward.

➟
112
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
 If you do decide to accept an attachment of any kind — 
music, video, a picture, or any other type of file — 
use an antivirus or security program to scan it before 
opening it (see “Check for Viruses,” earlier in this 
chapter).
 
➟ Be leery of links. If you receive an e-mail or IM with 
an embedded Web link, don’t click that link within 
the message. If you decide that visiting the Web site 
in question is worth your time (and the risk), copy 
the link to your computer’s clipboard and then paste 
it into your Web browser’s address bar. This method 
gives your Internet security program a better chance 
to block a malicious Web site or identify other prob-
lems with the link.
 
➟ Message with care. When you’re connected to an IM 
session, be on the lookout for strange or inappropri-
ate messages, links, or offers of downloads. A person 
with bad intentions may have managed to obtain the 
password and login information of someone you 
know or otherwise found a way to pose as someone 
else. End the IM session immediately if something 
strange happens, and consider notifying the provider 
of the IM service.
 
➟ Avoid autorun. Turn off the autorun feature that 
automatically starts the execution of programs on 
memory sticks and other USB devices (see Chapter 2). 
In Vista and Windows 7, you have a lot of control in 
this area. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel to open the Control 
Panel window.
 
2. Click Hardware and Sound and then click AutoPlay to 
display a screen like the one shown in Figure 6-6.

3. Make a new choice from the drop-down menu for any 
medium you want to change. (Notice that by default, 
Software and Games is set to Ask Me Every Time. It’s 
probably safe to autoplay DVDs and audio CDs, but if 
you have any doubts, leave this menu set to the 
default.)
 
4. Click the Save button to save your changes.

 In Windows XP, you don’t have this level of control, 
but you can make some changes in the Internet 
Options dialog box, which you access by choosing 
Start➪Control Panel➪Internet Options. Click the 
Security tab, scroll down to select Prompt under 
Launching Applications and Unsafe Files, and then 
click OK.
Stop Spyware
 
➟ Block secret transmissions. Set your firewall (see 
“Build a Firewall in Windows,” earlier in this chap-
ter) to block any requests by a program to send out-
going messages without your permission.
 
➟ Click Internet ads rarely and carefully. Be very 
selective about clicking online advertisements. When 
you open an ad, you’re communicating with a Web 
site, and that communication may trigger the down-
load of malware.
 
➟ Turn off e-mail previews and automatic down-
loads. Most capable e-mail programs allow you to 
turn off automatic previews and downloads of e-mail 
contents. Figure 6-7 shows the option that you’d dis-
able in Microsoft Outlook Express.
 
➟ Beware of unusual error messages on the Internet. A 
Web site may warn you that your computer is at risk or 
request your permission to download a free utility. 
Unless you asked for this sort of assistance — and also 
know and trust the source — close both the Web page 
and your Web browser without accepting the offer.
 
➟ Don’t take software from strangers. Be very careful 
about accepting any offer of free software. The program 
you receive may not be what you want, or it may 
deliver hidden malware along with a useful function.

 When you install a new piece of software, take the 
time to read all the installation options carefully. 
Some options may install features that you don’t 
want — and that may be contaminated with other 
things you don’t want.
 
➟ Heed all security warnings. Pay attention to any 
warnings that you receive from your Internet security 
program (see “Check for Viruses,” earlier in this 
chapter). It may notify you that a Web site is 
attempting to install spyware on your computer or 
that a program already on your PC is trying to send 
information to someone else. Accept the security 
program’s recommended action to block or delete 
the security threat.

➟

Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
Avoid Getting Hooked by Phishers
 
➟ Use an Internet security program that trawls for 
phishers. Programs such as Norton Internet Security 
add a notification bar to your Web browser to tell 
you whether you’ve reached a properly registered 
Web site or a phony/hijacked site, and display 
reports such as the one shown in Figure 6-8. These 
programs also scan incoming e-mails and block 
known attempts at phishing or notify you of danger-
ous communications.
Antiphishing report

➟
117
 Chapter 6: Keeping Intruders out of Your Computer
 
➟ Look up phone numbers yourself. If you receive a 
suspicious e-mail that appears to be from your bank 
or other financial institution, don’t call any phone 
number listed in the message. Instead, call the pur-
ported sender by using a number that you obtain 
from your own bills, invoices, or cards.
 
➟ Don’t believe everything you see. A site or message 
may use official-looking logos and legal-sounding 
language to reassure you of its legitimacy. Don’t be 
fooled. Logos and legalese can be copied from real 
communications or simply fabricated. Also don’t be 
fooled by statements in an e-mail or on a Web site 
that the communication has been scanned by antivi-
rus or security software. Those statements can be 
faked too.
 
➟ Beware of any unsolicited request for your login 
info. A common phishing tactic is an e-mail that 
tells you to click a link to update your financial 
information; otherwise, your accounts will be can-
celed. A legitimate Web site may require you to 
change your information from time to time — but 
always on the Web site itself and only after you’ve 
already logged in.
 
➟ Read the fine print on Web sites. Visit the Web sites 
of companies that you regularly do business with, and 
look for security warnings and other information 
posted there. Most legitimate companies are very quick 
to post warnings and specific advice about phishing 
attempts and other scams aimed at their customers.

➟
118
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
 
 If you realize (or suspect) that you’ve been duped by 
a phisher, treat the situation as though your wallet 
had just been stolen. Immediately notify all your 
credit card issuers and financial institutions, placing 
calls to numbers that you have on file from their offi-
cial documents. 
Can That Spam
 
➟ Maintain e-mail security. Install an Internet security 
program that includes filtering and blocking utilities 
for e-mail, and keep it current (see “Check for 
Viruses,” earlier in this chapter).
 
➟ When in doubt, throw it out. Don’t open a suspect 
message. Just delete it. If you open one by accident, 
however, never click any links in it, and never, ever 
respond to it.
 
➟ Know who your online friends are. If you use an 
IM service, reject any messages from people you 
don’t know. Most services allow you to create buddy 
lists for that purpose (see Figure 6-9). Unfortunately, 
marketers, promoters, salespeople, and crooks can 
find your ID and make themselves your buddy in an 
effort to reach you. Delete any name in your buddy 
list that you don’t recognize.

Getting Help 
When Prevention

W
hat a terrible question to have to answer: 
Should a valued, trusted computer live 
or die? The economics of personal computing, 
however, mean that a heroic effort to keep a 
wounded or dying machine alive isn’t always 
the rational answer.
As you ponder this existential issue, consider 
these facts:
 ➟ Every few months, a new wave of com-
puters arrives, and the new models are 
faster, better, and often less expensive 
than the ones that came before.
 ➟ In terms of monetary value, the whole of 
a PC is considerably less than the sum of 
its parts.
 ➟ Forget about the hardware, and think 
about any data stored on your computer 
that’s not also safely stored on a backup 
disk or drive. To borrow an aphorism 
from a credit card commercial: A brand-
new PC, $500. Your letters, e-mails, and 
photos, priceless.

Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
In this chapter, I point you to sources of help for an ailing computer 
and give you some tips to help with the repair-or-replace decision.
Identify the Problem: Hardware or Software
 
 For information on diagnosing and repairing hard-
ware, see the appropriate chapters in Part III. 
Software remedies are often specific to the program, 
but I provide some general tips in Chapter 4. Also see 
Part IV for fixes for your PC’s operating system 
(Windows).
 
➟ Hardware failure: When hardware fails, it usually 
can be replaced. Notice that I don’t say repaired. 
Modern computers have very little hardware that an 
amateur technician can fix, and the few parts that an 
expert might be able to repair (such as the motor for 
a hard disk drive) don’t make economic sense to 
repair . . . unless the value of the data stored on that 
drive convinces you otherwise. (For more informa-
tion, see “Weigh the Cost of Repair versus 
Replacement,” later in this chapter.)
 
 Q: How many computer hardware technicians does it 
take to change a light bulb? A: None. That’s a soft-
ware problem. (The light bulb is a replaceable con-
sumable, aka software; the wiring and power grid 
that support it are permanent hardware.)
 
 If you don’t want to go under the hood to replace a 
hard drive (see Chapter 11), one alternative is attach-
ing a new external hard drive to your PC via its USB 
port. (Figure 7-1 shows a typical external hard drive.) 
You may have to install a device driver provided by 
the drive’s manufacturer, or Windows may recognize 
the drive and help you configure it.

 Chapter 7: Getting Help When Prevention Fails

➟ Software failure: On the software side, things are dif-
ferent. Almost anything can be fixed, and the process 
doesn’t involve the use of a screwdriver (see Chapter 
4). Instead, you can use the advanced features of 
Windows to fix certain problems or reinstall the oper-
ating system or programs when repairs aren’t possible.
Find a Helper
 
➟ Computer manufacturers: In recent years, manufac-
turers have cut back sharply on their technical sup-
port departments or tried to turn what used to be 
free support service into a source of profit. Still, this 
option may be worth a try, especially if the computer 
is still under warranty or if you purchased an 
extended warranty that’s still in effect.
 
 The time to test manufacturer support is when you’re 
shopping for a new computer. You can start with a 
support Web page. To get a feel for the type and 
quality of customer care you’ll receive, contact the 

➟
124
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
manufacturer before you buy the PC, and ask a ques-
tion about something you don’t understand. If the 
company doesn’t treat you well before it has your 
money, what makes you think that it’ll be helpful 
after your check has cleared?
 
 Sometimes it’s worthwhile to pay a bit extra to 
obtain an extended warranty or access to technical 
support. Make sure that you understand the terms, 
however. Ask whether the company will assist you 
with any problem, even if it’s related to hardware or 
software that you add on your own or to the operat-
ing system.
 
➟ Computer repair services: I’m more than a little 
wary of dealing with many third-party computer 
repair services. Investigate them — and seek recom-
mendations from friends — just as you would before 
getting an auto repair. Remember that most of these 
shops charge by the hour and also hope to sell you 
replacement parts. That combination (and the poten-
tial conflict of interest) could cost you a lot of 
money if the shop isn’t good at what it does or hon-
est about the way it conducts business.
 
➟ Tech-savvy friends or relatives: This option may be 
your best bet. Ask around. Do you have a friend or 
relative who’s capable of repairing a computer? If so, 
offer him a reasonable flat fee to fix your machine — 
say, $50, a free dinner, or a mention in your will. If 
your friendly technician recommends replacing a 
part, pay him the actual cost of getting the part 
replaced at a reputable store. (Call a few stores to 
find out what that cost would be.)
 
 Don’t have a nearby friend, relative, or repair shop to 
fix your computer? No problem — you may be able 
to get help through Windows Remote Assistance, 
which I cover in the following sections. Windows 

➟

 Chapter 7: Getting Help When Prevention Fails
Remote Assistance allows anyone whom you invite — 
such as a professional technician or a friend who’s 
offered to help — to take control of your computer. 
The connection between the computers is encrypted 
to protect your data from interception by snoops on 
the Internet. In Microsoft lingo, the user asking for 
help is the novice, and the person coming to the res-
cue is the expert.

Weigh the Cost of Repair versus Replacement
 
1. Calculate the difference between what you’d spend for a 
new computer and what you’d spend for the replacement 
parts you need:
 
• Fully equipped new computer: In this chapter’s 
introduction, I mention that the cost of a modern 
PC is almost always much less than the sum of its 
parts. A fully equipped computer may cost $500 
and would include a fresh version of Windows.

➟
133
 Chapter 7: Getting Help When Prevention Fails
 
• Parts sold separately: Compared with purchasing 
a new PC, buying all the parts separately would 
cost . . . well, you can do the math yourself.
 
 Replacement motherboard with microprocessor: 
$200–$400
 
 Memory module, 2GB of RAM: $25–$50
 
 Hard disk drive, 500GB: $50–$75
 
 CD/DVD drive: $40
 
 Power supply: $30–$50
 
 Computer case (see Figure 7-7): $50
 
 Keyboard and mouse: $20–$50
 
 Windows operating system: $100–$200
 
 Basic applications: may vary from $40–$150 to 
replace or upgrade
 
 Here’s the value of looking at a computer in this way: 
If you have a reasonably current PC, and a couple of 
fairly inexpensive parts fail (such as the power sup-
ply, keyboard, and/or hard drive), it probably makes 
sense to repair what’s broken.
 
2. Apply the 50 percent rule, which states that if the cost of 
repairs (including any labor costs you may choose to pay 
to an expert) is less than half the price of a new machine, 
a fix-up job may make sense. On the other hand, if the 
motherboard fails, you’re probably looking at a repair 
that crosses the 50 percent yardline. (By the way, if a 
motherboard gets fried, the power supply and memory 
modules often are damaged as well and need to be 
replaced.)

➟
134
Part II: Keeping Your PC Healthy with Preventive Maintenance 
You can start with a bare-bones case and add the essentials–at a cost.
Figure 7-7

➟
135
 Chapter 7: Getting Help When Prevention Fails
 
 The 50 percent rule should also apply to extended 
warranties and support. I wouldn’t consider it ratio-
nal to pay more than half the cost of a new PC for 
technical support.
 
3. Consider one very important exception to the 50 percent 
rule: If your hard disk drive fails, and you don’t have 
backups of your irreplaceable data, it may make sense to 
pay hundreds of dollars to a professional disk-rescue 
company, which often (but not always) can extract data 
from failed drives.
 
 To find a hard-disk rescue company, search the 
Internet for hard disk data recovery. Typical fees are 
$200–$400.

Repairing the 
Monitor
W
ith the birth of the personal computer, 
we’ve all come to use the monitor (or dis-
play) as the window into the hard electronic soul 
of the device. A monitor lets us read words, look 
at images, and (together with a graphical user 
interface such as the Windows operating system) 
move things around or issue commands.
In Chapter 1, I explain the distinction between 
the two main kinds of computer monitors:
 ➟ CRT (cathode ray tube), which is like an 
old-style television set
  ➟ LCD (liquid crystal display), which is 
used in most flat-panel TVs and laptop 
computers
Though LCDs have just about completely 
replaced CRTs, there’s no good reason to change 
the terms you use for them. You can call these 
devices either monitors or displays, as I do in this 
book; people will get the picture either way.
I don’t need to get very technical here. After a 
monitor is connected to your computer, there’s 
very little to do with it other than sit back and 
watch it work.

1. If your display won’t display, make sure that it’s turned 
on. Nearly all units have an indicator light to show that 
they’re receiving power. Sometimes the light glows one 
color when the power is on but no signal is being 
received (amber or red, usually) and another color when 
it is getting a signal (probably green or blue).
 
2. If the monitor is turned on but the indicator light isn’t 
lit, examine the power cord to make sure that it’s con-
nected to both the monitor and its source of power. (If 
you have an LCD screen, you may have to check three or 
four plugs connecting the wall outlet, the power adapter, 
and the display.)
 
3. Make certain that power is flowing through the wall out-
let. The best test is to plug in a radio or lamp that you 
know is working. If the outlet isn’t supplying power, it 
may be connected to a turned-off wall switch (a connec-
tion you should avoid for computers and monitors), or 
the circuit may be dead because of a blown circuit 
breaker or other electrical problem.
 
4. If you have an older CRT, check the brightness, contrast, 
and other manual controls. Someone — any children or 
mischievous coworkers in the vicinity? — may have 
turned those dials or buttons all the way off. (Newer 
CRTs and all modern LCDs make their adjustments 
through onscreen utilities accessible from the keyboard.)
 
5. If everything so far is fine, check for the following problems:

 Chapter 8: Repairing the Monitor
 
• Monitor failure (CRT): A CRT monitor uses high 
voltage and somewhat delicate transformers and 
other parts. Its electronics eventually wear out — 
or can be fried by electrical surges or undervoltage 
(brownouts).
 
 Turn your monitor off and wait about 30 seconds; 
then turn the monitor back on. Watch and listen 
carefully. Did you see any hint of light as the power 
came on? Did you hear the high voltage energizing 
the CRT tube? Also, place the back of your hand 
close to the screen to feel for static electricity. If the 
monitor passes one or more of these tests, the power 
supply is working, the monitor has high voltage, and 
your problem probably is in the cable or the computer.
 
• Monitor failure (LCD): An LCD display requires 
lower voltage than a CRT does and usually has a 
longer life. The components that are most likely to 
fail are the backlight (a tiny fluorescent lamp that 
produces light that shines through the screen) and 
the thin LCD panel itself, which can get scratched, 
cut, cracked, or warped.
 
 With the monitor turned on, press one of the moni-
tor configuration buttons, probably on the front, on 
the side, or covered by a trap door. (You may need to 
find your monitor manual to find out which button 
to push for various adjustments.) You should see a 
pop-up menu. If you do, the monitor has power, and 
the screen is working. The problem must be in the 
cable connection or in your computer.
 
• Trouble with video output from your computer: 
I cover this situation in “Troubleshoot a Video 
Adapter” and “Reset a Video Driver,” later in this 
chapter.

➟

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
• Trouble with the video connections: You may 
find a crimp, break, or other fault in the connec-
tors on the PC or the display, or in the cable that 
runs between them (see Figure 8-1). Video cables 
should be carefully screwed into place when con-
nector posts are available, and you should make 
sure that the cables aren’t bent, left on top of heat 
registers, or otherwise endangered.
Check for bent or broken pins at both ends or the coble.
Figure 8-1
 
 One possible indicator of a problem with a cable or 
connector on an analog link is the loss of one or two 
of the primary colors (red, green, and blue) that are 
combined to produce other hues.

 Chapter 8: Repairing the Monitor
Troubleshoot the Display
 
1. One way to determine the likely source of problems with 
a display is to watch carefully as your computer starts up. 
If the opening screen (see Figure 8-2 for Vista’s) suddenly 
goes blank or is replaced by an error message, the moni-
tor and its connecting cable are likely working properly. 
The problem may be either the video adapter on the 
motherboard or a setting that you changed in the video 
adapter’s driver or in Windows.
If you see a startup screen in your version of Windows, 
your monitor and cable probably work.
Figure 8-2
 
 If you see a blue screen on startup — a condition 
called the Blue Screen of Death (or Doom) — you 
have a different problem. See “Beat the Blue Screen 
of Death,” later in this chapter.

➟
144
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
2. Restart your computer in safe mode, which automatically 
uses a very basic video setting. When Windows is loaded, 
choose Start➪Control Panel, and change the video set-
tings back to an acceptable set of parameters (see “Check 
and Change Display Settings,” later in this chapter). I 
explain how to use safe mode in Chapter 17.
 
3. If Step 2 doesn’t help, try attaching the suspect monitor 
to a computer that you know to be working. (Maybe you 
have another computer in your home or can take your 
monitor to a friend’s house.) If the monitor delivers the 
proper image, you know to concentrate your attention on 
your computer.
 
4. If your monitor uses a cable that detaches at both ends, 
swap it with a substitute for a second test. (Some cables, 
though, are attached permanently at the monitor end.)
 
 Never attach a cable to a computer that’s powered 
up. A slight misalignment of the plug can produce a 
short that could damage the video adapter, monitor, 
motherboard, or all three devices. Turn off both the 
monitor and the computer before making any 
cabling changes.
Beat the Blue Screen of Death
 
1. Start the computer again. If the problem doesn’t recur, 
consider yourself lucky — for the moment. Make backup 
copies of all your important data files and then check out 
the computer by using Device Manager and any diagnos-
tics programs provided by the manufacturer. For details 
on Device Manager, see Chapter 18.
 
2. Use the Last Known Good Configuration option (see 
Figure 8-3) to restart the PC with settings that were suc-
cessful recently. See Chapter 16 for details.

3. Try to repair Windows. The files for your computer’s 
installation of Windows may have been damaged (in 
technical terms, corrupted) as the result of a problem with 
the hard disk, an electrical spike that got past your surge 
protector and into the computer, or a computer virus (see 
Chapter 6). For directions on repairing Windows, see 
Chapter 14.
 
4. Reinstall Windows, which essentially refreshes all your 
system files and leaves your data and software programs 
intact. In the worst-case scenario, you may have to per-
form a clean install, which requires electrically wiping the 
disk clean, reformatting it, and installing Windows all 
over again. For details, see Chapter 14.

➟ Reduce the display resolution. In general, the high-
est resolutions and the highest number of colors in 
the palette require the most system resources. Try 
reducing the resolution (see “Check and Change

ou can divide a computer’s essential vital

 ➟ Electrical: Electrical power energizes the

functions.
 ➟ Mechanical: Tiny electrical motors and

the computer’s logical system.
Fixing electronic circuits is far beyond the 
scope of this book, and software problems are 
covered in Chapter 4 and in Part IV, which 
deals with the operating system. So in this 
chapter, I cover the two remaining types of prob-
lems: electrical and mechanical (except for hard 
drives, which are the subject of Chapter 11). I 
also briefly mention modems, which can have 
both electrical and mechanical ailments.

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
For purposes of this chapter, I’m going to assume that before your 
computer stopped working, it was running properly.
Diagnose a Failing Power Supply
 
➟ Is the electrical outlet supplying current? Test it 
with a lamp or radio. If a circuit breaker has shut off 
current to the outlet, try to determine what caused it 
to close down. Is another major appliance (such as a 
refrigerator, large-screen television set, or space 
heater) using the same circuit?
 
➟ Are the computer’s fans and drives still running? If 
so, that fact may indicate that the power supply is still 
functioning. On the other hand, if none of the comput-
er’s indicator lights, fans, or other electrical parts seems 
to be alive, the power supply may not be supplying.
 
➟ Do you smell anything? Often, the first sign of 
impending doom is a whiff of the particular acrid 
odor of fried electronics; sometimes, the smell pre-
cedes the failure.
 
➟ Do you hear anything? Did you hear a pop or sizzle 
coming from the computer? This auditory clue fre-
quently precedes the olfactory hint that something 
electrical is shorting out or failing. Turn off power 
now, and check inside the case to find out what’s hot 
and what’s not.
 
➟ Do you see anything? Electrical scorch marks or 
melted wiring are possible signs of a failure of the 
power supply.
 
 If you see smoke (or flames), immediately turn off 
the computer by using the switch on your surge pro-
tector or removing the electrical cord from the wall 
socket. If things don’t calm down quickly, call the 
fire department and head out the door.

➟
159
 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
Research a Replacement Power Supply
 
1. Open the case of your PC, following the directions in 
Chapter 2.
 
2. Locate the power supply, which is almost always a large 
metallic box in a corner of the case (see Figure 9-1).
Power supply
Figure 9-1

➟
160
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
 You can also look for the point where the electrical 
cord from the wall current attaches to the computer 
and follow it to the power supply at the other end, 
inside the case.
 
3. Make note of any model information and specifications 
that you find on the power supply.
 
4. Write down the details about the power supply’s form fac-
tor, a term that refers to the size and shape of the power 
supply and the way it bolts to the case. The most com-
mon designs for modern computers are
 
• ATX: In this design, a 20-pin connector delivers 
power to the motherboard, and a separate 4-pin 
cable and connector together deliver the same set 
of voltages and control circuits to the microproces-
sor (see Figure 9-2).
 
• BTX: A 24-pin connector goes directly to a 24-pin 
receptacle on the motherboard. Note, however, 
that BTX motherboards are fairly rare commodi-
ties; few manufacturers converted to this proposed 
Intel design, and newer, smaller computer circuits 
pretty much leapfrogged it.

➟
161
 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
Cables and connectors of an ATX power supply
Figure 9-2
 
5. Check the wattage. The power supply has to produce at 
least the minimum amount of wattage to power the 
motherboard and everything else attached to the system. 
Supplies are usually rated for the amount of continuous 
and peak wattage that they can deliver. Look for this 
information on the manufacturer’s label, like the one 
shown in Figure 9-3.

➟
162
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
Key information about the manufacturer and ratings 
usually appear on a label like this one.
Figure 9-3
 
 Keep in mind the proper thermal fit for your 
machine. If you replace a 500-watt power supply 
with a 750-watt unit, for example, you need to know 
whether your computer is capable of exhausting the 
extra heat that the larger unit will produce. Seek guid-
ance from suppliers if necessary.
 
6. Check the cables and connectors. Make a list of the types 
of connectors your computer uses and the number 
required of each type. Here’s what you have to match:

➟
163
 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
 
• P1 connector: A modern computer has one main 
connector from a standard power supply to the 
motherboard. Designers refer to it as the PC main 
connector or (as I do) P1. It’s the largest and most 
important of the cables and connectors running 
from the power supply. Depending on design, a P1 
may use a connector with 20 or 24 pins (refer to 
the descriptions of ATX and BTX designs in Step 4). 
You can see in Figure 9-4 that this connector is very 
large compared with anything else on the mother-
board. You should have no problem finding that 
connector again if you’re reconnecting the existing 
power supply or installing a new one.
P1 connector attaches here on an ATX motherboard.
Figure 9-4

➟
164
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
 If you have a really old computer (one that was 
put into service more than a decade ago), it may 
use an AT power supply. This design brings power 
to the motherboard through two separate sets of 
cables and connectors, labeled P8 and P9 (see 
Figure 9-5).
P8 and P9 connectors
Figure 9-5
 
• P4 connector: The superfast microprocessors on 
modern motherboards are fed by their own source 
of 12-volt power, delivered through a 4-pin con-
nector labeled P4 (see Figure 9-6). Some high-end 
computers require two P4 connections or a single 
8-pin connector.

➟
165
 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
P4 microprocessor power connector
Figure 9-6
 
• Molex connectors: The next set of connectors com-
ing off the power supply (see Figure 9-7) delivers 
current to peripherals such as hard drives and in 
some designs to special adapters plugged into the 
system’s electrical bus. The attachment points of 
these Molex connectors are about an inch long 
and are fed by four wires — typically, a red wire 
carrying +5 volts, a yellow wire delivering +12 
volts, and two black wires that serve as grounds.
 
• Auxiliary power connectors: Lowest on the electri-
cal totem pole are auxiliary power connectors (see 
Figure 9-8), which are often used to deliver cur-
rent to tiny fans placed atop particularly hot 
microprocessors and graphics cards. Some of these 
small assemblies involve only two wires and a 
connector the size of a match head.

 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
 
2. Choose Start➪Shut Down to close Windows and turn off

3. Unplug the electrical cord that connects the power supply 
to wall current. Also remove any cables and plugs that 
attach to ports on the computer if they might interfere 
with your ability to open the case and work inside.
 
4. Open the computer’s case (see Chapter 2).
 
5. Carefully examine the placement of the power supply, as 
well as the wires and connectors that exit it inside the 
case (see “Research a Replacement Power Supply,” earlier 
in this chapter).
 
6. To remind yourself what plugs in where, put a piece of 
masking tape on each connector coming from the power 
supply, and mark it with a number; then put a piece of 
tape marked with the same number on the connection 
point (on the motherboard or an internal device such as 
a hard drive).
 
 or
  
 With a digital or video camera, take a series of close-up 
shots of the interior of the computer to help you remem-
ber how things looked before you began your surgery.
 
 Although modern computers are pretty sturdy 
devices, a large static discharge can still damage deli-
cate components. It’s good practice to touch the case 
with one hand and then touch the motherboard with 
the other hand. Without removing the hand that’s on 
the motherboard, now you can move the hand that’s 
on the case to the motherboard to help you discon-
nect the wires.
 
7. When all the connections have been labeled, photo-
graphed, or filmed, unfasten the power cables that attach 
to the motherboard. Most wires and cables inside the 

➟
168

case are held in place by clips along the side of connec-
tors or merely by the friction of a tight fit. Take your 
time, and be careful: These connectors aren’t designed for 
heavy use, and the motherboard itself can be fragile.
 
8. Remove the screws that attach the power supply to the 
case. In general, you need to use a screwdriver (either a 
flat-head or an X-shaped Phillips-head tool) to remove 
these screws. In many designs, all the attachment points 
are on the outside frame.
 
 Take great care using any metal tool inside the case 
so that you don’t scratch the fine electrical traces that 
carry power between parts on the motherboard. Also, 
be very careful not to drop any screws into the inte-
rior of the case. If any do land there, you must 
retrieve them before you turn the computer back on; 
otherwise, they will short out electrical parts.
 
9. Remove the power supply itself.
 
10. To install the new power supply, perform Steps 9–3 
in reverse order. Make sure that you correctly reinstall 
the power connectors to the motherboard and all other 
internal parts.
Replace the Cooling Fan
 
1. Prepare a well-lit, stable working space. For details on 
setting up your working environment and tools, see 
Chapter 2.
 
2. Choose Start➪Shut Down to close Windows and turn off 
your computer.
 
3. Unplug the electrical cord that connects the power supply 
to wall current. Also remove any cables and plugs that 
attach to ports on the computer if they might interfere 
with your ability to open the case and work inside.

4. Open the case (see Chapter 2).
 
5. Locate the malfunctioning fan. There usually is a fan 
mounted on the back of the case or sometimes on the 
front toward the bottom of the case. You may also see a 
fan on top of the motherboard or mounted directly on 
top of the microprocessor.
 
 I don’t recommend that you try to replace the fan 
inside the power supply. If that fan has failed, you 
may have other problems. Either take the power sup-
ply to a professional repair technician or replace it 
yourself (see “Remove and Replace the Power 
Supply,” earlier in this chapter).
 
6. Locate the power cord, trace it back to the accessory plug, 
and unplug it.
 
7. Remove the mounting screws (or sometimes just sliders 
or snaps) that hold the fan in place (see Figure 9-10). A 
motherboard-mounted fan may sit in a board expansion 
slot; a microprocessor fan just snaps to the top of the 
chip’s heat sink or carrier.
 
8. Lift the fan out of the case.
 
9. To install the new fan, perform Steps 8–3 in reverse 
order.
 
 Your PC’s fan may reside on (or in) a plastic or metal 
carrier instead of attaching directly to the case. If you 
have such a model, after you remove the fan and car-
rier, disassemble the unit to remove the fan and 
install the new fan in the carrier before replacing the 
assembly in the computer case.

 Chapter 9: Solving Electrical and Mechanical Problems
 
 If you have a cable modem and cable television ser-
vice, check to see whether any TV set on the premises 
is receiving a picture. If the TV screen is blank, the 
problem lies somewhere between the cable company 
and the modem. It could be that the local system is 
out of service for the moment, a repair crew is work-
ing somewhere in your neighborhood, or the wiring 
in your home or office is damaged. Call the cable 
company’s technical support number, and ask a sup-
port representative to check for problems.
 
3. Make sure that you have proper connections between the 
modem and your computer.
 
4. If the modem has electrical power, a live signal, and cor-
rect connections but still isn’t working, try doing a 
power-off reset of your modem. Some models have an 
actual on/off switch; you turn off others by unplugging 
them. Leave the modem off for about 15 seconds and 
then reapply the power.
 
 If everything seems to check out at your end, call 
your ISP’s support department. Someone there can 
log in to your modem, test the settings, and probably 
get things working again if you don’t have hardware 
issues.

Installing 
Memory
O
ne of the most basic — and not terribly 
complex — operations you can perform 
inside the case of your computer involves 
installing system memory modules, or RAM 
(which stands for random-access memory). No 
soldering or arc-welding is involved, and the 
lifting is very light. You just have to pay close 
attention to details and take care not to dam-
age your computer while you try to make it 
better.
Adding memory (up to your machine’s specific 
limit) is generally the most cost-efficient way to 
increase its speed. Doubling a modern PC’s 
memory from 1GB to 2GB of RAM may boost 
overall operation speed by as much as 50 per-
cent; going from 2GB to 4GB could give you a 
25 percent improvement. Why the discrepancy? 
That first jump gives Windows and other pro-
grams most of the space they need for efficient 
operation. Moving from 2GB to 4GB improves 
performance, but not as much as the first step 
up does.
In this chapter, I show you the basics on 
installing memory. For much more informa-
tion, check out my book Fix Your Own PC 
(Wiley Publishing).

Find the Right Memory Module
 
 Check the specifications for your computer to find 
the maximum amount of RAM it’s capable of manag-
ing. Most modern computers sold to consumers can 
handle no more than 4GB; paying for and installing 
more than the maximum is a waste of money and 
could cause problems in some machines.
To find out what kind of memory modules you already have installed 
in your PC (and need to purchase), use one of these methods:
 
➟ Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System 
Tools➪System Information. The System Information 
window opens, displaying a report on memory 
(among other things), as shown in Figure 10-1.
Physical memory is what’s installed on physical modules inside your PC.
Figure 10-1

➟
177
 Chapter 10: Installing Memory
 
➟ Visit your PC maker’s Web site, which may have a 
feature that will scan your system or tell you what 
memory was installed at the time of purchase.
 
➟ Visit a computer retailer’s Web site, and look up the 
parts you need by entering the manufacturer and 
model number of your computer. The System 
Information window (refer to Figure 10-1) displays 
the manufacturer name and model.
 
➟ Get an online memory scan. Several companies that 
sell memory modules offer an online scan of your 
computer that identifies the kind of memory you 
need. One example is Micron Technology’s Crucial 
System Scanner at www.crucial.com.
 
 Do you really need to know the difference among 
SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3? Not really, except 
to recognize that these are four of the most common 
types of memory modules for modern PCs. How 
about the speed difference between, say, PC2-5200 
and PC2-5300? Same thing applies. If your system is 
designed to use DDR PC2-5200 memory, that’s what 
you should shop for.
Install a New Memory Module
 
 Nearly all memory vendors provide instructions for 
installing their modules. Many also answer questions 
over the phone or through a chat feature on their 
Web sites.
 
1. Prepare your workspace, assemble your tools, and ground 
yourself properly (see Chapter 2).
 
2. Make sure that the computer is turned off, and unplug 
the power cord and cables.

➟
178
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
3. Place the computer on a sturdy, well-lighted surface, and 
open its case (see Chapter 2).
 
4. Look for a set of long slots that hold upright DIMM 
memory modules. Most motherboards have two or four 
such slots, usually black, with a set of plastic lockdown/
ejector clips at each end. The system shown in Figure 
10-2 has a four-slot motherboard.
Installed memory modules, latched into place by clips.

Figure 10-2
 
 If you’ve already run a scanning program (see “Find the 
Right Memory Module,” earlier in this chapter), you 
should know how many DIMM slots to look for and how 
many of them are already filled. In general, you should 
have two or four identical modules. If you are installing 
larger or faster modules as a pair, they should go in the 

➟
179
 Chapter 10: Installing Memory
first two slots. In most designs, the slots closest to the 
microprocessor are considered to be slots 0 and 1 (and 
are marked that way on the motherboard in tiny letters).
 
 I mention SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random 
Access Memory), DDR (Double Data Rate), and 
other memory types earlier in this section. These 
terms refer to how the memory chips work. DIMM 
(Dual Inline Memory Module) refers to how the 
chips are mounted on a circuit board and installed in 
your system.
 
5. If you need to remove an old module to install a new 
one, press evenly on both of the lockdown/ejector clips 
to release the unit; then lift the module straight up and 
out of the slot. Place the removed module on a noncon-
ductive surface such as a cardboard box or plastic bag.
 
6. Take the new module out of its antistatic bag, holding it 
by the edges. Avoid touching the metallic connectors on 
each side of the bottom of the module to keep oils from 
your fingers from interfering with the module’s contact 
with the motherboard.
 
7. Follow the installation instructions provided by the 
memory seller. In most situations, you’ll be asked to put 
the largest-capacity modules in the first slots and the 
smaller ones in the higher-numbered slots; for a small 
number of motherboards, you’ll be asked to do things 
the other way around.
 
8. Locate the notch in the row of pins at the bottom of the 
module. It needs to line up with a matching pin or key in 
the DIMM slot on your motherboard (see Figure 10-3). 
The location of the notch depends on the type of module 
your computer uses.

➟
180
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
This notch lines up with a pin on the motherboard.
Figure 10-3
 
 If the notch and pin don’t line up, turn the module 
180 degrees and try that way.
 
9. With the notch and pin aligned, press evenly on both 
ends of the module until it’s fully inserted into the slot 
on the motherboard and the lockdown/ejector clips click 
into place.
 
 Don’t attempt to force the module into the slot if it 
seems to be a complete mismatch. Contact the pro-
vider of the memory module to make sure that you 
received the proper type for your PC.
 
10. Spend a minute or two examining the inside of the case 
to make sure that all the memory modules are locked 
down properly and that you didn’t leave any tools, pens, 
or other objects inside.
 
11. Put the cover back on, secure it properly, and return the 
machine to its usual location.
 
12. Reattach the cables and power cord, and turn on the juice.

➟
181
 Chapter 10: Installing Memory
 
13. Check the amount of installed memory, which you can 
do in either of two ways:
 
• Watch the startup screen carefully. Many com-
puters display the amount of installed memory in 
the startup screen — usually in megabytes, so a bit 
of translation may be necessary. In computer 
math, 1,024MB is 1,000 megabytes, which is the 
same as 1 gigabyte (1GB). So if you put 4GB of 
memory in your machine, you may see it dis-
played as 4,096MB.
 
• Check the System Information dialog box. To 
open this dialog box, refer to “Find the Right 
Memory Module,” earlier in this chapter.
Troubleshoot Jumbled Memory
So what do you do if your computer doesn’t recognize the new mem-
ory or refuses to start up after you install a new module?
 
➟ If the computer starts but displays an error message 
during startup, read the details of the message care-
fully. Some computers may detect new memory and 
then ask you to restart so that the memory settings 
are updated.
 
 Some older computers may have BIOS (Basic Input 
Output System) chips that don’t recognize more 
modern memory modules or larger amounts of 
memory. See the next paragraph for details on what 
to do.

➟
182
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
➟ If your computer starts after the installation of new 
modules but reports an incorrect amount of RAM, 
perform the troubleshooting steps at the end of this 
section to make certain that the new units are 
installed properly. If the problem continues, check 
with the maker of your machine to see whether a 
BIOS update is available. In most cases, the update 
can be delivered to you over the Internet.
 
➟ If the computer won’t start, first make sure that you 
reconnected the power cords and other cables to 
your PC after installing memory.
 
➟ If all the connections are in place but the computer 
still won’t start, reopen the case (see Steps 1–3 of 
“Install a New Memory Module,” earlier in this chap-
ter) and then follow these steps:
 
1. Go back to the start of the installation instructions, 
and recheck each step.
 
2. Make certain that the modules are fully seated in their 
slots, with the lockdown/ejector clips latched into 
place at both ends.
 
3. Remove the modules (see Step 5 of “Install a New 
Memory Module,” earlier in this chapter), and examine 
them carefully (see Figure 10-4). Make sure that the 
notches in the modules line up with the pins in the 
motherboard slots and then reinstall them.
 
4. Look around inside your computer to make sure that 
you haven’t accidentally disconnected one of the 
internal power cables to the hard drive or other 
components.

➟
183
 Chapter 10: Installing Memory
Carefully remove the newly installed modules and re-install them.
Figure 10-4
 
5. If you tried all these troubleshooting steps and still 
can’t bring your computer to life or get it to recognize 
new memory, return the computer to the condition it 
was in before you put in new modules (see Chapter 
16), reinstall the original modules, and then test 
the PC.

➟
184
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
6. If the computer works with the old memory but not 
with the new memory, contact the seller of the RAM 
module. You may have purchased the wrong type, or 
you may be the unlucky owner of a defective module. 
Manufacturers usually test memory modules, so fail-
ure is rare, but it’s possible.

Changing a Drive, 
Made Easy
W
hy replace a hard drive? I can give you 
two very good reasons:
 ➟ Cost: If a hard drive fails, it has to be 
replaced, because there’s no cost-efficient 
way to repair it.
 ➟ Performance: The other reason to change 
a hard drive is to increase your comput-
er’s efficiency or capacity. A larger hard 
drive not only gives you more storage 
space, but also lets Windows use more 
virtual memory for faster operation.
If you’re considering installing a new hard drive 
because the old one has run out of space, a 
quick and easy solution is an external drive. 
You can buy one almost anywhere: a computer 
supply store, a discount superstore, an electron-
ics shop, or one of thousands of online outlets. 
Just plug the drive into a USB port or a network 
switch, and it’s ready to go. If your current hard 
drive still works (and isn’t too old), you can 
add a second drive without having to reinstall 
Windows and all your applications.
In this chapter, I help you with what some 
people consider to be the “hard” parts of add-
ing or replacing a drive, but as you’ll see, the 
process isn’t too difficult.

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
 For much more detail on hard drives and installation 
procedures, see my book Fix Your Own PC (Wiley 
Publishing).
Determine What You Need
 
1. Will you be installing a new boot drive — the one your 
computer starts from — or an additional drive to use 
for storage? On most PCs, the boot drive is connected to 
the first data port on the motherboard. (By techie tradi-
tion, the first port is marked 0, the second is 1, and so 
on.) There’s no difference in the construction of boot and 
storage drives, but if you’re installing a boot drive, you’ll 
have to instruct your computer where to look for 
Windows and the essential tracks it uses to bring itself to 
life (see “Format the Drive,” later in this chapter).
 
2. What kind of data cables does your hard drive use? 
Nearly all current PCs use a variation on the ATA 
(Advanced Technology Attachment) design called either 
PATA or SATA:
 
• PATA (parallel ATA): Until about 2007, ATA used 
a wide, flat ribbon cable carrying 40 wires (see 
Figure 11-1), and the 16 bits of each computer 
word moved along the cable in parallel — one 
alongside another — from the motherboard to the 
drive, or vice versa.
 
• SATA (serial ATA): Today, most PCs have switched 
to a thin round cable with just eight wires (see 
Figure 11-2), and the bits of information move 
along the cable in serial communication, with one 
bit behind another. In addition, the changeover to 
thin round cables reduces much of the clutter under 
the covers of a modern PC and improves the flow 
of cooling air inside the box.

➟
187
 Chapter 11: Changing a Drive, Made Easy
Older computers use a wide ribbon cable for hard drive data.
Figure 11-1

➟
188
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
Most new machines use the compact serial wire.
Figure 11-2
 
3. What attachment points are available?
 
• Internal drives: Some computers have a cage with 
rails like the side ribs of an oven; a hard drive 
slides into the cage along the rails and then is 
secured by screws or latches (see Figure 11-3). 
Other computers have multiple slots or rails along 
the frame of the case (see Figure 11-4).
 
 Generally, it doesn’t matter where in the case a hard 
disk drive is located, because (unlike a CD or DVD 
drive) it doesn’t provide external access. You do need 

➟
189
 Chapter 11: Changing a Drive, Made Easy
to secure the drive, however, so that it doesn’t fall on 
other parts inside the case. Also make sure that it 
doesn’t block the flow of air inside the computer.
 
• External drives: Between the PC and the external 
drive is a communication cable that plugs into 
each device. Most external drives also require con-
nection to an electrical outlet, although a few 
devices can draw their power from the PC through 
a USB or FireWire cable (see “Install a New 
External Drive,” later in this chapter).
Slide the hard drive into the cage.

4. What type of power-supply connector does the disk 
drive use? The computer’s power supply (see Chapter 9) 
provides DC voltage to spin the drive’s internal platters, 
move the read/write head back and forth, and communi-
cate with the computer itself. Your hard drive may use 
one of the following kinds of cables to connect to the 
power supply:
 
• Molex connector: Older PATA drives generally use 
a large, fat white Molex connector (see Figure 
11-5). A key on the male connector mates with a 
slot on the female receptacle on the drive, making 
it difficult (but not impossible) to install the cable 
upside down.

➟
192
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
• SATA connector: Newer SATA drives use a thin 
black connector (see Figure 11-6) that provides 
added protection against accidents during installa-
tion. Some SATA drives also include a Molex con-
nector as a backup.

 You can use a converter to change a Molex connector

including www.TigerDirect.com and www.

Install a New Internal Drive
 
1. Prepare your workspace, assemble your tools, and ground 
yourself properly (see Chapter 2).
 
 If you’re replacing your boot drive, make sure to back 
up any data that you want to save and install on your 
new hard drive.
 
2. Make sure that the computer is turned off, and unplug 
the power cord and cables.
 
3. Place the computer on a sturdy, well-lighted surface, and 
open its case (see Chapter 2).
 
4. If you’re replacing a drive, unplug its data and power 
cables, and remove it from the case. This process may be 
as simple as sliding the drive out of a cage. In other cases, 
you have to remove two or four screws on the sides of 
the drive. (Put the screws aside so that you can use them 
with the new drive.)
 
5. If your new drive needs rails to mount in the case, 
remove the rails from the drive you took out before 
installing the rails that should have come with the 
new drive.
 
6. Slide the new drive partway into the slot you just vacated 
or, if you’re adding a second drive, partway into a vacant 
slot. Installing the drive only partway holds it in place 
but gives you flexibility while you hook up the data and 
power cables (see Steps 7–8). You’ll seat the drive in the 
slot later.
 
 Depending on the design of your computer, it may 
be easier to connect the data and power cables before 
you slide the drive into place.

➟
194
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
7. Find an available data cable and connector near the loca-
tion where you’ll be installing the new drive, and plug 
this cable into the data port of your new hard drive. Data 
cables are just lying around inside the case, connected to 
the motherboard on one end and to nothing or to 
another hard drive on the other.
 
 Most PATA ribbon cables can connect to two devices, 
with one device marked master and the other marked 
slave. (If you’re using a PATA system, consult the drive 
maker’s instructions to find out how to configure the tiny 
jumpers or switches on the device to match its status as 
master or slave.) On the other hand, SATA data cables are 
one to a customer, connecting one device to one interface 
on the motherboard. 
 
 If the new drive is going to be your boot drive, you 
generally need to use the first data connector, which 
usually is marked 0 on the motherboard. If the drive 
will be used as an additional storage device, you can 
attach it to any other available data connector.
 
8. Locate an appropriate power cable, again choosing one 
near where the new drive will be installed, and plug this 
cable into the power connector on the new hard drive.
 
9. Slide the drive into place (see Figure 11-7).
 
10. Make sure that the drive and cables are properly secured 
and that you didn’t leave any tools or other objects inside 
the case.
 
11. Put the case back on, secure it, and return the computer 
to its usual location.

Install a New External Drive
 
 Most external drives connect to a computer’s USB 
port, so I cover that type in this section. For details 
on installing a different type, consult the instruction 
manual or my book Fix Your Own PC (Wiley 
Publishing).
 
1. Plug the drive’s USB cable into a free USB port on your 
computer.
 
 Your PC can be on or off when you plug in a USB 
device.
 
2. Plug the other end of the USB cable into the external 
drive’s USB connector (see Figure 11-8).
 
3. Attach the power cord to the drive, and plug it into 
wall current or — better yet — a surge protector (see 
Chapter 1).
 
4. Turn on the power to the external drive (and to your 
computer, if you turned it off before installing the 
new drive).
 
 Nearly all devices proceed to install any necessary drivers 
or utilities automatically when you turn them on. Follow 
any onscreen instructions.

 If Windows or your antivirus software displays a 
security alert during installation, click Accept or

Chapter 6) before continuing with the installation.
 
5. Proceed to the next section, “Partition the Drive.”

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
Partition the Drive
The next step in preparing a new disk is partitioning, which assigns 
logical units and file systems to the hard drive. Partitions are the basic 
containers for data. Each partition exists in a specified physical loca-
tion on the hard drive and functions almost like a separate drive.
 
1. Decide how many partitions you want to have on your 
hard drive. Depending on the size of the drive and the 
version of Windows you’re using, you may be able to use 
a single huge partition. This configuration is the easiest 
and (in my opinion) best one to use, if your computer 
supports it. If not, you have to create two or more 
smaller partitions. A 250GB drive, for example, could be 
set up as two logical drives of 125GB each, or as one 
50GB drive and two 100GB drives.
 
 Even if your computer can support one large parti-
tion, you may want to create at least two partitions. 
Some professionals recommend creating a relatively 
small partition — 20MB or so — to hold only 
Windows and using the rest of the drive for all other 
programs and data.
 
2. Use the manufacturer’s utility to create the partitions. 
Hard drive manufacturers usually provide a utility that 
automates the creation of partitions; this utility (such as 
the Western Digital example shown in Figure 11-9) 
comes on the drive itself or on an accompanying CD or 
DVD. Follow the instructions faithfully, and accept the 
utility’s recommendations on what partitions to create.
 
 Most external drives come preformatted and ready to 
run immediately in Windows. For information on 
reformatting, see the next section, “Format the Drive.”

➟
199
 Chapter 11: Changing a Drive, Made Easy
Follow the utility’s instructions to partition your new drive.
Figure 11-9
Format the Drive
Formatting a drive applies a set of magnetic markers to the disk plat-
ters, allowing your computer to set up a file system that indexes what 
data is placed where.
 
1. Use the formatting utility included with the hard drive 
(such as the example shown in Figure 11-10) to format 
the device. For most users, the best practice is to accept 
the manufacturer’s recommended (default) settings. The 
program may create one of the following types of file 
systems:

➟
200
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
Make any required changes 
before you start the process.
Figure 11-10
 
• FAT (File Attribute Table): You would use FAT or 
FAT32 (see the next paragraph) only if you need to 
maintain compatibility with older equipment or if 
you intend to load and switch between a current 
version of Windows (XP, Vista, or 7) and an older 
one (such as Windows 95, 98, or ME). That situa-
tion isn’t likely to apply to most readers of this 
book.
 
• FAT32: Like FAT, FAT32 is an older file system. 
Generally, it’s unable to deal with drives (or parti-
tions within drives) larger than 32GB.

➟
201
 Chapter 11: Changing a Drive, Made Easy
 
• NTFS (Windows NT File System): If you’re using 
Windows XP, Vista, or 7, the preferred file system 
is NTFS, which is more efficient than FAT and 
FAT32, and also more capable of recovering from 
certain types of disk errors. NTFS is essential for 
use with large disk drives.
 
 On most new external drives, the standard setup 
provides a single FAT32 partition, which means that 
Windows will use the entire capacity of the new 
drive as a single volume. If you choose to reparti-
tion the drive so that it appears to Windows to be 
two or more drives, you can do so — but doing so 
will erase any preloaded software or utilities that 
came with the drive.
 
2. If you intend to use the new hard drive as your boot 
drive, install special boot tracks and Windows itself on 
that drive. You accomplish this task by using a utility 
provided with the operating system. In most instances, 
you turn off your computer, place the Windows DVD in 
your CD/DVD drive, and then turn the computer on 
again. The computer recognizes the presence of the DVD 
and gives you the option of installing the operating sys-
tem on your hard disk drive (see Figure 11-11).
 
 Follow the instructions carefully, and be prepared for a 
lengthy process; most installations require several hours 
to complete.
 
 Early PCs had one or two floppy disk drives, which 
were called A and B. To maintain compatibility with 
older hardware and software, those two letters are not 
available to identify hard drives in a standard setup. 
Drive C usually is the boot drive, followed by drives 
D through Z. (Special utilities are available for rare 
and unusual configurations with dozens of drives, but 
that topic is well beyond the scope of this book.)

3. Open the case (see Chapter 2), plug in the PC’s power 
cord, and turn the computer on. Listen for hard drive 
activity (you should hear the heads moving on an active

the case. If the power supply or other internal electronics 
may have failed; contact the manufacturer for advice on a 
possible repair.

6. If the drive doesn’t show up in the Computer/My 
Computer window or in Device Manager, it’s not com-
municating with the computer. Recheck all cables.
 
7. If the drive still doesn’t respond or appear in the My 
Computer/Computer window or in Device Manager, call 
the manufacturer for technical support.
Troubleshoot a New External Drive
 
1. Make sure that the external drive is plugged into a live 
electrical outlet, turned on, and receiving power. Nearly 
all external drives use an adapter that transforms AC wall 
voltage to DC voltage; check to see that all plugs are 
seated properly in their receptacles.
 
2. Listen for any activity. I have yet to find a completely 
silent disk drive. You should be able to hear the drive 
motor, an internal cooling fan, or both. If the device is 
switched on and receiving power, but you detect no signs 
of life, the new drive’s power supply or other internal 
electronics may have failed. Contact the manufacturer for 
advice on a possible repair.
 
3. Open Device Manager (see Chapter 18), or open the My 
Computer or Computer window, as follows:
 
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪My Computer.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Choose Start➪Computer.
 
 The easiest way to access Device Manager in Vista 
and Windows 7 is to click the Start button and then 
type device manager in the Search Programs and 
Files text box.

4. Pull down the Disk Drives list to see whether the new 
drive is displayed.
 
5. If the drive doesn’t show up in the Computer/My 
Computer window or in Device Manager, it’s not com-
municating with the computer. Recheck all cables.
 
6. If the drive still doesn’t respond or appear in the My 
Computer/Computer window or in Device Manager, call 
the manufacturer for technical support.
 
7. Try reinstalling the drive’s software and device drivers 
(see Chapter 4).
 
8. Run a diagnostics program (see Chapter 5) to find out 
whether the computer’s ports are functioning properly. 
Follow any onscreen instructions.
 
9. Take advantage of the external drive’s portability by test-
ing it on another PC. You could try plugging it into a 
friend’s computer to see whether it recognizes the drive, 
or maybe a local computer repair shop will allow you to 
make the same test on its equipment. Don’t forget to 
take — and use — the AC adapter and data cable that 
came with the drive.
Install a New Internal CD/DVD Drive
 
 You can use either an internal or an external 
CD/DVD drive. External drives simply plug into 
your computer, so I discuss installing an internal 
drive in this section. 
 
1. Prepare your workspace, assemble your tools, and ground 
yourself properly (see Chapter 2).

➟
206
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
2. Make sure that the computer is turned off, and unplug 
the power cord and cables.
 
3. Place the computer on a sturdy, well-lighted surface, and 
open its case (see Chapter 2) after you’ve grounded 
yourself.
 
4. If your new drive needs rails to mount inside the case, 
install the rails that should have come with it.
 
5. Prepare the location for the new drive. You probably 
need to remove a cover on the front of your case where 
the new drive will go. This cover may snap off and on, or 
it may be attached by small screws that you’ll need to 
remove. (Put the screws aside so that you can use them 
to secure the new drive.)
 
6. Slide the new drive into the mounting slot. Depending 
on your case design, you may need to slide the new 
drive in from the front or (more likely) insert the drive 
from inside the case so that it sits flush with the front 
of the case.
 
 Depending on the design of your computer, it may 
be easier to connect the data and power cables (Steps 
7–8) before you slide the drive into place.
 
7. Find an available data cable and connector near the loca-
tion where you’ll be installing the new drive, and plug 
this cable into the data port on your new hard drive (see 
“Install a New Internal Drive,” earlier in this chapter).
 
8. Locate an appropriate power cable, again choosing one 
near where the new drive will be installed, and plug it 
into the power connector on the new drive.

➟
207
 Chapter 11: Changing a Drive, Made Easy
 
 CD and DVD drives provide audio as well as data to 
your computer. New drives use the data connection 
for audio only. Check your documentation. If your 
drive requires an analog audio connection, attach the 
supplied cable from the drive’s audio out to your 
sound card’s audio input connector.
 
9. Make sure that the drive and cables are properly secured 
and that you didn’t leave any tools or other objects inside 
the case.
 
10. Put the case back on, secure it, and return the computer 
to its usual location.
 
11. Reattach the cables and power cord, and turn on the 
computer.
Test a New CD/DVD Drive
 
1. Open Device Manager (see Chapter 18).
 
2. Click the plus sign (Windows XP) or the right-facing 
arrow (Vista and Windows 7) next to the DVD/CD ROM 
Drives entry.
 
3. Double-click the DVD/CD drive name in this list to dis-
play the Device Properties dialog box (see Figure 11-13), 
and check for the message This device is working 
properly.
 
4. (Windows XP only) Click the Properties tab, and make 
sure that the check box titled Enable Digital CD Audio 
for This CD-ROM Device is checked.

5. If everything is working properly, click OK to close the 
Device Properties dialog box. If you don’t, follow the 
troubleshooting steps for your type of drive — internal or 
external — earlier in this chapter.
 
6. Install the software that came with the new drive. 
Windows includes a fairly simple disk-burning applica-
tion, but your new drive probably includes a more robust 
program. Install it now according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
What do you do? In this chapter, I show you some solutions to com-
mon printer problems.
Check Printed Pages for Problems
 
➟ Dark vertical or horizontal lines: Dark lines run-
ning the length or width of a printed page, as you 
see in Figure 12-1, may be caused by a dirty or dam-
aged printhead (inkjet printer), contamination of 
components (laser printer), or low ink or toner lev-
els (both types). On a laser printer, these lines may 
also be caused by a scratch or other damage on the 
drum, which usually is part of the laser cartridge 
that’s replaced when toner is depleted.
 
➟ Uneven print tones: If the characters or images on 
the page are uneven in darkness, that result usually 
indicates low ink or toner.
 
 If you’re using a laser printer, you can usually eke out 
a few dozen more pages from a cartridge by remov-
ing it and gently shaking it to redistribute the toner.
 
 On a laser printer, other possible causes of uneven 
printing are damage to the photoreceptor or a light 
leak into the receptor from a nearby lamp or win-
dow. You don’t have to operate a laser printer in a 
darkroom, but you should keep its cover in place 
except when you have to replace the toner and drum 
or clear a paper jam. (I keep my laser printer in a 
corner, away from the windows.)
 
➟ White vertical lines (laser printers): White gaps or 
lines down the page may be caused by damage to 
the toner cartridge or debris in the path between the 
cartridge and the drum. You may be able to remove 
the obstacles; otherwise, you’ll have to replace the 
cartridge.

➟
211
 Chapter 12: Fixing a Malfunctioning Printer
If you see this, check for dirt in the printer or a damaged component.
Figure 12-1

➟
212
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
➟ Black or white blotches: Blotches of black or white 
on the paper may indicate contamination of the 
drum or the fusing roller. The drum isn’t easy to 
clean, but if your cartridge includes a drum, like the 
one shown in Figure 12-2, the problem will be fixed 
when you replace the cartridge. Most printers include 
a small brush and sometimes a cleaning solution for 
the fusing roller. Consult the printer’s instruction 
manual for advice.
A laser cartridge like this replaces all the 
critical printer components each time you replace it.
Figure 12-2
 
➟ Streaky lines (laser printers): Streaks on the page 
sometimes tell you that toner needs to be cleaned off 
the printer’s rollers or electrostatic parts.

➟
213
 Chapter 12: Fixing a Malfunctioning Printer
 
➟ Low resolution or dropouts (inkjet printers): The 
tiny ink nozzles on the print head of an inkjet 
printer are prone to clogs that can result in loss of 
resolution or dropouts in text or graphics. Many 
printers include a utility for cleaning the inkjet head; 
consult the manual for details.
 
 One other issue to consider is the quality and type of 
paper you use in your printer. To get the most out of 
a laser printer, use good-quality copy paper that’s 
certified for a laser printer or copy machine. Inkjet 
printers generally require a smoother paper surface 
because the ink is applied wet, and the text or image 
can become fuzzy if the ink is absorbed into the 
paper. Photorealistic inkjet printers work best with 
glossy or coated stock. Consult the printer manual for 
advice, and don’t be afraid to experiment with small 
quantities of different paper grades; some office-
supply stores offer free sample packs for testing.
Test the Printer’s Hardware
 
1. Make sure that the printer is turned on and plugged into 
a live electrical outlet. If the printer doesn’t seem to have 
power, test the outlet by plugging in a lamp or radio that 
you know is working properly. If the lamp lights or the 
radio sings but the printer won’t come to life, the printer 
may have suffered an electrical failure.
 
2. Check the printer’s paper and ink levels. Some printers 
are smart enough to stop the job when you run out of 
supplies but not communicative enough to tell you why. 
Study the printer’s instruction manual to find the mean-
ing of any error lights on the printer or messages on your 
PC’s monitor.

➟
214
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
 Many — probably most — printers today include 
software that notifies your Windows printer driver 
when ink supplies are low. Get into the habit of 
checking your printer’s window each time you send 
a document to it, and look for a low-ink warning. 
Click this warning to find out which cartridge will 
need to be replaced soon.
 
3. Check for a paper jam. Paper jams are usually caused by 
one of three conditions:
 
• Debris stuck in the paper path: Consult the 
instruction manual for advice on cleaning the 
paper path. Use a vacuum cleaner with a soft 
brush to remove debris (including tiny pieces 
of paper).
 
• High humidity: Humidity causes paper to stick to 
other pieces of paper or to printer rollers.
 
 One way to deal with humidity is to store your paper 
in a sealed box, installing only as much as you need 
to print a job.
 
• Inappropriate paper: Check your printer’s specifi-
cations for acceptable weights and grades of paper. 
Stock that’s too thin, thick, or glossy can jam a 
printer. (Also see “Check Printed Pages for 
Problems,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
4. Run the printer’s built-in self-test. Consult the manual 
or call the manufacturer to find out how to test the 
machine.
 
• If the self-test fails, and the test program makes 
no suggestions about repairs (such as cleaning 
certain parts or replacing ink or toner cartridges), 
the printer may need servicing at a professional 
repair shop.

➟
215
 Chapter 12: Fixing a Malfunctioning Printer
 
 If your printer needs servicing, but its warranty has 
expired, replacing it probably makes more economic 
sense than repairing it.
 
• If the self-test works, move on to the next step.
 
5. Print a test page. To send the test page, turn on the 
printer and follow these steps:
 
a. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Printers and Faxes 
(Windows XP), Start➪Settings➪Printers (Vista), or 
Start➪Devices and Printers (Windows 7). 
 
b. Right-click the printer’s icon, and choose Properties 
(XP and Vista) or Printer Properties (Windows 7) 
from the shortcut menu. The printer’s Properties 
dialog box opens (see Figure 12-3).
Click Print Test Page to eliminate a 
particular application as the problem.
Figure 12-3

➟
216
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
c. On the General tab, click the Print Test Page button. 
Windows displays a message confirming that the test 
page was sent.
 
• If the test page prints successfully, as shown in 
Figure 12-4, your problem is most likely a setting 
within a program, such as your word processor. 
Try resetting the program’s printer options.
 
• If the test page doesn’t print, click the 
Troubleshoot Printer Problems link in the test-
page confirmation message. The resulting help 
screen (see Figure 12-5) presents the most likely 
problems and helps you find the support Web site 
for your particular brand of printer. Click the most 
appropriate link for your problem. If you don’t see 
your problem listed, click Show All to see a page 
of other possibilities, including issues with device 
drivers and spoolers (features that store print jobs 
on the hard drive temporarily while the printer 
processes other jobs).
 
6. Switch printer cables. Substitute a data cable that you 
know to be good, and print a test page again. If the 
printer works, the original cable has failed and should be 
replaced.
 
7. Connect the printer cable to a different USB port. Most 
computers have at least four and sometimes eight USB 
ports, and on rare occasions, one may go out of order. To 
test the port you use to connect to the printer, plug in 
another device (such as an external disk drive, a flash 
memory key, or a digital camera) to see whether the sys-
tem recognizes its presence.
 
8. Check Device Manager to see whether it’s reporting any 
hardware failures or indicating a problem with any port 
or printer drivers. For details on using Device Manager, 
see Chapter 18.

let you bring in your printer to run this test in the hope 
that you’ll end up buying something.

➟
219
 Chapter 12: Fixing a Malfunctioning Printer
Test the Printer’s Software
 
1. Make sure that you’re using the appropriate printer driver 
and that it’s in good condition. A printer’s built-in intelli-
gence can freeze or produce garbled output if you use an 
incorrect, outdated, or corrupted printer driver. To check, 
follow these steps:
 
a. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Printers and Faxes (XP), 
Start➪Settings➪Printers (Vista), or Start➪Devices and 
Printers (Windows 7). 
 
b. Right-click the printer’s icon, and choose Properties 
(XP and Vista) or Printer Properties (Windows 7) 
from the shortcut menu. The printer’s Properties dia-
log box opens.
 
c. Click the Advanced tab (see Figure 12-6), and make 
sure that the driver settings are correct and that the 
appropriate driver is being used. The driver name 
should match the brand and model of your printer. If 
it doesn’t match, you could somehow have installed 
the wrong driver; even if it does match, you can try 
installing a new driver. To do so, click the New Driver 
button, and follow the printer wizard’s instructions.
 
2. See whether your printer has enough memory by printing 
a complex document. If the document doesn’t print or is 
of unacceptable quality, you may need to add more 
memory to your printer or adjust printer settings to mini-
mize the amount of memory that the document requires. 
Consult the instruction manual for specifics on adjusting 
these settings.

Taking Care of 
Your Mouse 
(or Trackball) 
and Keyboard
T
he good news is that mice, trackballs, and 
keyboards make computing easy. The bad 
news is that because they’re mechanical, they 
eventually wear out. How people use them 
affects their life span too. Some users treat the 
devices gently; others have a clicking and typ-
ing style that closely resembles a worker on a 
chain gang pounding rocks.
You can do a few things to improve the perfor-
mance of these devices and perhaps extend 
their lives. Attempting to repair broken units 
may not make sense, however, because they’re 
so inexpensive. Replacement keyboards, for 
example, sell for as little as $10.
The really good news is that new mice, track-
balls, and keyboards are truly “plug and play” 
devices. Removing the one that came with 
your computer and replacing it with a new 
one takes about as much effort and technical 
expertise as unplugging an electric lamp and 
plugging it back in.

Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on caring for these devices so 
that you don’t have to replace them before their time — and show you 
what to do when replacement day finally comes.
Keep Your Keyboard Clean
 
➟ Never, ever get it wet. Here’s a rule that’s more 
ignored than observed:
 
 Don’t place a cup of coffee, a can of soda, or any 
other liquid anywhere near your keyboard — or your 
PC, for that matter. Spilled liquids are very likely to 
short out the electronics. Although you may be able 
to clean a keyboard that’s been doused with soda, 
this is a problem that you don’t need and can easily 
avoid.
 
 If your keyboard is bound to be in a wet or sloppy 
environment (a kitchen or a restaurant, for example), 
you should look into purchasing a keyboard skin. 
The impervious clear plastic covers all the keys and 
still lets you peck them. You can also purchase an 
industrialized keyboard that comes sealed in a water-
proof or water-resistant membrane. You can start 
with www.sealshield.com, which carries a line of 
guaranteed-waterproof keyboards and mice.
 
➟ Give it a good cleaning every few months. To clean 
a keyboard, follow these steps:
  
1. Turn off the power to the PC, unplug the keyboard, 
and turn it over to shake out dust and dirt.
 
 If you have a USB keyboard or mouse that attaches to 
your PC with a USB cable (see Figure 13-1), you can 
unplug it while the computer is turned on. If your 

➟
223
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Your Mouse (or Trackball) and Keyboard
mouse is old enough that it uses a PS/2 connector 
(see “Vet Your Mouse,” later in this chapter), the saf-
est way to proceed is to shut down the PC before 
removing the plug.
USB cable
Figure 13-1
 
2. For even better cleaning, use a can of compressed air 
(available at office-supply stores) to blow between 
individual keys, or use a vacuum cleaner’s crevice-tool 
attachment to suck out dirt. This tool concentrates the 
power of the vacuum and can pull debris out from 

➟
224
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
between and under the keys. Just use caution; this tool 
normally is made of hard plastic, so you don’t want to 
be too aggressive with your cleaning.
 
 An excellent tool for cleaning the keyboard, screen, 
and other parts of the computer is a soft, unused 
paintbrush. I keep a couple of different sizes on or 
near my desk at all times. The soft bristles won’t 
scratch hardware or screen surfaces, and they can 
reach between keys and into other cracks and crevices 
to remove dust and other undesirable debris (see 
Figure 13-2).
Use commercial air or a soft brush (even a clean 
paintbrush) to keep your keyboard shipshape.
Figure 13-2

➟
225
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Your Mouse (or Trackball) and Keyboard
 
3. Use a soft cloth dampened with a weak plastic cleaner 
or a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to polish the 
keys and the surrounding case. The most fastidious 
among you may want to use the same solution on a 
cotton swab to clean between the keys. 
 
 If it’s absolutely necessary, you can remove individ-
ual keys with a special tool that’s supplied with many 
keyboards; a technician’s tweezers with hooked ends 
will also work. Work very carefully to avoid breaking 
the plastic keycaps or the somewhat delicate switches 
beneath them.
 
4. Let the keyboard dry for a half an hour or so.
 
 You can use a hairdryer on low heat to speed the 
drying process. Just keep the air stream moving, 
and don’t get the nozzle too close to sensitive 
plastic parts.
 
5. When the keyboard is nice and dry, reattach it to your 
computer.
 
 You can plug in a USB keyboard while the computer 
is on. If your mouse is an older model with a PS/2 
connector, reattach it before you turn on the power.
Diagnose a Troubled Keyboard
 
1. If the keyboard completely stops responding, check to see 
whether the device is connected properly at the computer 
end, and look for any cuts or crimps in the cable. Fix any 
loose connections and straighten any kinks; if the cable is 
cut, replace it.

➟
226
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
 
2. If the connections and cable are fine, try rebooting the 
computer to see whether the keyboard comes back to life. 
With luck, you were experiencing a once-in-a-blue-moon 
system lockup.
 
 If the keyboard freezes more frequently than a blue 
moon, or if the intervals between freeze-ups begin to 
shorten, you may be seeing early symptoms of the 
impending failure of a major component, such as the 
motherboard or the power supply. Run a diagnostic 
program such as the one that ships with many com-
puters, or take the computer to a repair shop for a 
good once-over.
 
3. Check the connection between the PC and the keyboard, 
as well as the status of the keyboard’s device driver, as 
follows:
 
a. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Keyboard (XP) to open 
the Keyboard Properties dialog box. In Windows 7 
and Vista this direct path is available from the icon 
view of the control panel.
 
b. Click the Hardware tab. You should see the name or 
type of keyboard (listed in the Devices list), as well as 
the manufacturer and the means of communicating 
with the system.
 
c. Check the Device Status entry to see whether the com-
puter is communicating with the keyboard properly 
(see Figure 13-3).
 
d. Click the Properties button to display another 
Properties dialog box; then click the Driver tab to 
examine the details of the driver and make any 

➟
227
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Your Mouse (or Trackball) and Keyboard
necessary changes or updates. (For details, see “Revive 
a Dead Mouse, Trackball, or Keyboard,” later in this 
chapter.)
 
 You rarely have to make driver changes for a basic 
component such as a keyboard unless there’s been 
some sort of electrical corruption of the device or the 
driver has been deleted or changed.
Click for error messages in
the Device Properties section.
Figure 13-3
 
e. While you’re in the neighborhood, you can close the 
second Properties dialog box and click the Speed tab 
of the Keyboard Properties dialog box (see Figure 
13-4) to make a few adjustments in the response of 

➟
228

the keyboard, such as the repeat rate (how quickly the 
keyboard produces a string of repeated characters 
when a key is held down).
These settings tell your keyboard 
how quickly to respond.

 You can also set the cursor’s blink rate in this tab. 
This function really isn’t related to the keyboard, but 
technicians had to put the control somewhere.
 
f. Click OK to save your settings and close the dialog 
box.
 
4. Every few months (to be especially conscientious), run 
the keyboard test that’s part of most diagnostic programs 
to test the electronic logic of the keyboard and the moth-
erboard’s keyboard controller. The test also forces you to 

➟
229
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Your Mouse (or Trackball) and Keyboard
run through all the keys on the board, including a few 
that you may not ordinarily use. Follow any instructions 
that the program gives you.
 
 If you’re still having problems, turn to “Revive a 
Dead Mouse, Trackball, or Keyboard,” later in this 
chapter.
Practice Good Mousekeeping
 
 Much of what I say about mice in this chapter also 
applies to trackballs and other pointing devices (see 
Chapter 1). Also, except where I indicate otherwise, 
these tips apply to both mechanical and optical mice.
 
➟ Keep your desktop clean. Your mouse travels miles 
and miles, sliding back and forth on your desktop. 
Along the way, it picks up dust, pollen, oils, cookie 
crumbs, and whatever else is floating around your 
office. Sooner or later, the going is going to get a bit 
sticky. To give your mouse a clear path, wipe off your 
desktop — and your mouse pad, if you use one — 
once a month or more often if you notice any kind 
of buildup on your mouse pad.
 
➟ Give your mouse a bath. If your mouse seems to 
have lost its way, the first thing to do is give it a 
good cleaning, like so:
 
• Mechanical mouse: Unplug the mouse from the 
computer, turn it over, and (on most mice) rotate 
the plastic or rubber ring to release the rubber 
roller ball (see Figure 13-5). Use a can of com-
pressed air or the crevice-tool attachment of a 
vacuum cleaner to remove debris from the cavity. 
Then clean the ball (and rollers, if any) with mild 
soap and water or alcohol, using a lint-free cloth.

➟
230
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
Twist this ring to free the roller ball.
Figure 13-5
 
• Trackball: A trackball is essentially an upside-
down mechanical mouse with its roller ball built 
into a mouse body or even into a keyboard (see 
Figure 13-6). The ball rests loosely in a cavity, 
where sensors track horizontal and vertical move-
ment. Instead of moving the hardware across the 
desk, you use your hand to spin the ball in place. 
You clean a trackball the same way that you clean 
a mechanical mouse. (See the manual for direc-
tions on how to remove the roller ball on your 
particular model.)

 You should clean a mechanical mouse or trackball 
every few months, whether or not you think it needs 
cleaning. Check the manual that came with your 
mouse for any specific instructions.
 
• Optical mouse: Cleaning an optical mouse is sim-
ple because it contains no moving parts. Use an 
alcohol cleaner or a small spray of window cleaner 
on a rag to remove any buildup from the sensor 
on its bottom.

Vet Your Mouse
 
1. If your mouse or other pointing device is acting peculiar, 
first make sure that it’s connected to the computer prop-
erly. Fix any loose connections, and adjust or replace any 
twisted or damaged cable.
 
2. If the connection is fine, choose Start➪Control Panel➪
Mouse (in Classic View in Vista and Windows 7) to open 
the Mouse Properties dialog box. Click the Hardware tab 
and then click Properties (see Figure 13-7) to see whether 
Windows is reporting a failure of a USB port (or a PS/2 
serial port, if you have an older mouse that uses that type 
of port, such as the one shown in Figure 13-8).
Check location and device status.

3. If you see no report of a problem with a port, click the 
Driver tab of this dialog box to check for conflicts or 
problems with device drivers (see “Revive a Dead Mouse, 
Trackball, or Keyboard,” later in this chapter).
 
 You should also consult the manufacturer’s Web site 
to see whether updated or corrected device drivers 
have been released for your mouse.

4. To adjust the ways in which your mouse responds, click 
the other tabs of the Mouse Properties dialog box (such 
as the Buttons tab, shown in Figure 13-9), and make any 
changes you want. Each manufacturer offers different 
types of adjustments for its mouse device, so the tabs in 
your dialog box may differ from those in the figure.

6. If your mouse or trackball came with a control program 
for setting up special features, the same program usually 
offers basic test software. Run this software to see how 
your mouse is performing, and follow any onscreen 
instructions.

 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Your Mouse (or Trackball) and Keyboard
Revive a Dead Mouse, Trackball, or Keyboard
 
1. If your mouse, trackball, or keyboard isn’t functioning at 
all, restart the computer in safe mode (see Chapter 17).
 
 Restarting in safe mode is also the thing to do if you 
somehow disabled the keyboard or pointing device 
and can’t use either to get where you need to go to 
set matters right.
 
2. Working in safe mode, you should be able to repair or rest 
the device’s driver in Device Manager (see Chapter 18).
 
3. If the hardware itself has failed — which eventually will 
be the case with mechanical devices like these — the 
solution is to unplug the old and plug in the new, as I 
describe in the next section.
 
 If you’ve decided that your keyboard or mouse is 
beyond repair, you can try a radical approach: Put it 
in the dishwasher. Although no hardware manufac-
turer officially sanctions this sort of repair, people do 
it, and I’ve done it myself. Use a gentle cycle, cool 
dry, with little or no soap, and let the device dry out 
for a week or so before you plug it in again. You have 
nothing to lose, and this method does work 
sometimes.
Replace a Dead Mouse, Trackball, or Keyboard
 
1. Remove the deceased device from your computer.
 
• USB devices: You can leave the computer on while 
you disconnect (see Figure 13-10).
 
• PS/2 devices: Turn the computer off before you 
disconnect.

➟
236
Part III: Fixing Sick Hardware 
You can attach and detach a USB keyboard while your PC is running.
Figure 13-10
 
2. Plug in the replacement keyboard or pointing device.
 
3. If you turned the computer off in Step 1, turn it back on.
 
4. Follow all instructions from the maker of the replace-
ment device to install the new device’s driver or utility 
program.
 
 I recommend that you always have a replacement 
mouse or trackball and keyboard on hand. Like hard 
drives and other mechanical elements of a PC, these 
devices are bound to fail sooner or later. Keeping 
replacements in your supply closet (they won’t go 
stale) can save you time and aggravation.

W
hen you buy a new PC from a retailer or 
directly from a manufacturer, it ordinar-
ily comes with Windows already installed. It’s 
almost always better — both financially and 
technically — to get Windows this way. The 
maker of the computer should have installed 
all the necessary drivers and made any neces-
sary tweaks in settings to match the particular 
combination of hardware in the box.
In four situations, however, you may need to 
install or reinstall Windows yourself:

In this chapter, I show you how to repair and replace Windows on 
your PC.
 
 Be sure to keep the alphanumeric product key that 
came with your Windows installation disc. You can’t 
install Windows properly without this key.
Repair a Windows XP Installation
 
1. Choose Start➪Turn Off Computer➪Restart to restart your 
computer, and watch the screen carefully. You should see 
a message to press a function key (F2 probably) or 
another key combination to enter the BIOS (Basic Input 
Output System) screen. See the manufacturer’s documen-
tation for more information on your particular computer.
 
2. Press the designated key or key combination. You have 
only a few seconds to press this key to interrupt the 
startup process and enter the BIOS screen.
 
3. Look for an option called First Boot Device, Boot 
Sequence, or something similar. (You may have to select 
Advanced Options or another submenu to find it.) Press 
the arrow keys on your keyboard to select this field; then 
press Enter.
 
4. In the resulting screen, select CDROM/DVD.
 
5. Press the Esc key until you return to the main BIOS 
screen.
 
6. Follow the onscreen instructions to save your new set-
tings and exit BIOS setup. Your computer will restart 
from the CD/DVD drive.

 Chapter 14: Repairing, Refreshing, and Reinstalling Windows
 
7. Insert your Windows XP Setup CD into the drive.
 
 Some computer manufacturers tried to save a few 
pennies by not providing a copy of the Windows disc 
with the systems they ship. If you didn’t receive a 
Windows disc with your computer, the maker may 
have placed a recovery utility in a separate partition 
on the computer’s original hard drive. Visit the man-
ufacturer’s Web site for advice on how to access that 
hidden partition during startup.
 
 The problem with this sort of hidden partition is that 
it doesn’t allow you to install Windows on a replace-
ment hard disk drive. You’ll have to purchase physi-
cal Windows discs from the computer maker or from 
a computer store.
 
8. Restart your computer. A startup screen like the one 
shown in Figure 14-1 appears. (Depending on the 
Windows or setup discs you have for your computer, you 
may see a slightly different menu.)
 
 You may see an interim message that asks you to 
confirm that you want to start from the CD/DVD 
drive. Follow the onscreen instructions (which usu-
ally are to press any key).
 
9. Choose Install Windows XP.
 
10. In the next screen, if you’re asked whether you want to 
install Windows XP now, select that option. (Don’t 
choose the option to use the Recovery Console.)
 
11. In the next screen, press F8 to accept the Windows XP

to press one of the function keys as the system 
restarts to go to a hidden partition.
 
13. In the System Recovery Options window, select Startup

tion of Windows to determine which files need to be 
repaired or replaced.
 
14. Follow any onscreen instructions.

 If you’re asked whether you want to replace a current 
version of a file with an older version, click No. If the 
installation process finds a newer version of a file on 
your computer, it means that you’ve upgraded the 
file from an online source; you should keep the 
newer file.
 
15. Wait to see what the utility reports:
 
• Successful repair: If the problem with your 
Windows installation is relatively minor, Startup 
Repair may be able to bring it back to health with-
out erasing your software and personal files.
 
• Failure to repair: If Startup Repair can’t cure your 
PC’s illness, it displays a report that provides some 
details on the problem. Make full notes, and dis-
cuss the issue with the manufacturer’s support 
department or a repair technician.
 
 Startup Repair can’t correct hardware failures, such 
as a failing hard disk drive that corrupts files. (See 
Chapter 11 for more info on hard drives.) Also, it 
can’t remove all the tendrils of a virus. A capable 
security software program should scrub away all 
traces of viruses and other forms of malware (see 
Chapter 6).
Refresh Windows
Another option is reinstalling Windows over the existing version — 
a process called refreshing. Refreshing may fix a few problems that 
repairing doesn’t, but it can’t fix viruses or conflicts between versions 
of system files. The process I describe in this section applies to all 
current versions of Windows, though the precise screens you see will 
be a little different in each Windows version. To do a refresh, follow 
these steps:

➟
247
 Chapter 14: Repairing, Refreshing, and Reinstalling Windows
 
1. Start your computer from the CD/DVD drive, as 
described in Steps 1–6 of the preceding two sections.
 
2. Insert your Windows installation disc into the drive.
 
3. Restart your computer. You see a screen similar to the 
one shown in Figure 14-4.
 
4. Select the Install Now option.
 
 Don’t choose an option to change partitions or refor-
mat the drive. Either option would erase all your 
software and personal data.
 
5. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Choose Install Now.

Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
Know When to Reinstall Windows
If repair attempts fail (see “Repair a Windows XP Installation” or 
“Repair a Vista or Windows 7 Installation,” earlier in this chapter), and 
if refreshing doesn’t have the desired effect (see “Refresh Windows,” 
earlier in this chapter), reinstalling Windows should fix almost any 
problem. Reinstallation works best if:
 
➟ The manufacturer supplied a restore disk with 
the computer. That disk returns a PC to its original 
factory-delivered state. If you don’t have a restore 
disk, you have to perform an ordinary installation 
from the original Windows discs.
 
 You may be able to fix things with System Restore 
(see Figure 14-5). This process returns your system 
to an earlier state — before you installed updates 
or third-party software — but doesn’t affect your 
data files.
 
➟ Your computer is able to start, and you can get to the 
operating system.
 
➟ You can make backup copies of all your personal 
data. The easiest way to do this is to plug in an exter-
nal hard disk drive (see Chapter 11) and copy the 
files from your computer to the external drive. You 
can also make backups on a DVD (about 4.7GB of 
data) or on a CD (about 700MB of data) if your 
computer is capable of burning discs and if the 
CD/DVD drive is functioning.
 
 The bad news? A complete reinstallation wipes the 
hard drive clean, removing all software and all your 
personal files. Also, reinstalling Windows won’t 
fix any problems with misbehaving hardware or 
incompatible devices that you added on your own.

ers of those pieces of hardware, including updated 
device drivers and other adaptations that make the 
products work better with Windows.)
Select Recommended Restore, and click Next.

1. Make copies of all the personal files on your computer: 
word processing, spreadsheet, database, photos, videos, 
music, and so on. You don’t need to make backup copies 
of your software programs; you’ll need to reinstall those 
programs anyway when Windows is back in place.
 
2. Start your computer from the CD/DVD drive, as 
described in Steps 1–6 of “Repair a Windows XP 
Installation” or “Repair a Vista or Windows 7

3. Insert your Windows installation CD into the drive.
 
4. Restart your computer.
 
 Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 present slightly 
different startup screens. I describe the Windows 7 
procedure in the following steps, but the procedures 
in Windows XP and Vista are similar. The object is to 
get through the opening screens to the custom install 
screen, where you can reformat your hard drive and 
begin a clean installation.
 
5. In the startup screen, select the Install Now option.
 
6. In the next screen, select I Accept the License Terms, and 
click the Next button.
 
7. When you’re asked what kind of installation you want to 
do, select Custom (Advanced).
 
8. If you’re given a choice of partitions, select the one in 
which you want to install Windows. In most cases, you 
have only one or two choices: maybe a small partition 
(200MB or so) and a large one (30GB–100GB or larger). 
Select the larger partition for your Windows installation.
 
9. In the next screen, click Advanced to expand the options 
at the bottom of the screen, and choose the option to

Y
ou and I are sentient beings. We can 
perceive our world. PCs, however, know 
nothing. All they can do is move around 
numbers that humans have placed in their 
nonliving memory.
But every computer has a feature that gives it a 
personality of sorts, as well as information 
about its parts and capabilities. This feature 
falls under the general category of system con-
figuration or system setup.
Part of this setup or configuration information 
is stored in a special part of the computer’s 
memory where it won’t get lost when the 
power is turned off (the BIOS). Part of it is 
stored on the system’s hard drive. This founda-
tional memory tells the computer about its 
world — what disk drives are attached, what 
other kinds of memory it has, and other details 
involving all the hardware that makes up the 
machine.
This information is stored when the computer 
is built. Sometimes, it’s useful to look at this 
data to reconfigure the PC or help identify 
problems.

In this chapter, I show you how to use the System Configuration tool 
to search for the sources of problems caused by corrupted, missing, or 
misassigned programs and elements of Windows.
 
 Very technical elements of system configuration, such 
as setting BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) and 
CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Silicon, a type 
of solid-state memory), are beyond the scope of this 
book. You may want to leave this type of configura-
tion to an expert.
View and Document System Setup Screens
 
 Here’s an example of the process for viewing system 
setup information on a Dell Dimension PC. Your PC 
may have a slightly different procedure.
 
1. Turn on or restart the computer, and watch the monitor 
closely. When you see the blue Dell logo, the F2 prompt 
should appear soon afterward (see Figure 15-1). This 
prompt indicates that the BIOS has initialized the 
keyboard — prepared it for first use.

2. Immediately press the F2 key on your keyboard. After a 
short pause, a system-setup screen sho uld appear. Your 
PC may display slightly different information from the 
screen shown in Figure 15-2.
Navigation pane

 If you press F2 too late, your PC will proceed to load 
Windows. Don’t turn it off; wait for Windows to 
load, restart your computer, and try again.
 
3. Select options in the navigation pane by using the arrow 
keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down through 
the navigation pane. (You need to use the arrow keys 
because your mouse or other pointing device probably 
won’t be working this early in the startup process.) As 
you select each option, the screen displays details on cur-
rent and available settings.
 
 Depending on the design of your PC’s setup screen, 
pressing the Enter key or arrow keys expands or 
collapses a list of available options. The onscreen 
display should tell you how to navigate the list.

➟
256

4. Write down all the settings you see in each screen.
 
 Some people use a digital camera to take close-up 
images of setup screens. If you go this route, make 
sure that you can read all the information in the 
images.
 
5. Consult the instruction manual or online support pages 
for your computer model to find a list of your computer’s 
standard (default) settings, and identify the process for 
restoring all the settings to their original default condi-
tion. You may not want or need to use this emergency 
parachute, but someday, it may be the way to get out of 
an otherwise-unresolvable technical bind.
 
 Store all the information you’ve gathered — including 
handwritten notes or digital photographs — with the 
rest of your computer documentation so that it’s 
available if you need it later to solve a  configuration 
problem.
 
6. Press the Esc key one or more times until you see a 
prompt that asks whether you want to exit this utility 
or save the data and exit. You should not have changed 
anything during this inspection tour, so select the exit 
option. Your system should resume the normal startup 
process and return you to Windows.

3. Click the Services tab, which displays a long list of the 
current software services running in Windows. Most of 
these services won’t mean a whole lot to you, but it’s 
interesting and surprising to see what’s loaded on your 
computer. If you’re using this utility to solve a problem, 
see “Select Diagnostic Startup,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Click the Startup tab, which lists the programs that 
launch every time you start your machine. You’ll recog-
nize some applications that you use regularly, such as 
Microsoft Office or your antivirus program. The ones you 
don’t recognize are launchers or helpers for other hard-
ware and software that help improve performance or are 
required for some operations.
 
5. Click the Tools tab, which lists the software tools you can 
use to inspect or troubleshoot your system. (Interestingly, 
Microsoft’s help-desk technicians may use the same tools 
to help you uncover and repair a problem with your 
computer.)
 
 You can experiment with these tools, but use caution. 
Tools such as Registry Editor can cause some serious 
system ills if they’re used incorrectly.

starting with anything that isn’t a Microsoft product 
and, therefore, may be incompatible with Windows.

Settings
I
f your PC ran fine yesterday (or just a few 
minutes ago), but all of a sudden it won’t 
load Windows, ask yourself this essential ques-
tion: What has changed since the last time this 
computer performed properly? Here are a few 
possible answers:
 ➟ You installed new software.
 ➟ You uninstalled or deleted software.
 ➟ Microsoft or another software company 
delivered a major update to your 
computer.
 ➟ You installed new or updated device 
drivers.
 ➟ You recently changed the settings or con-
figuration of Windows.
 ➟ You deleted or changed one of the system 
files of Windows or another program.
 ➟ The lights just dimmed or the power 
went out, perhaps because of an electrical 
storm.

Any of these events could result in unexpected, unwanted changes in 
critical files on your computer. Fortunately, you may be able to turn 
back the clock to resolve problems. I show you how in this chapter.
 
 If you recently installed new hardware inside your 
PC, or if an existing piece of hardware has failed, you 
should start by troubleshooting the equipment, not 
the software.
Undo Something You Just Did
 
1. Start Windows in safe mode. This mode loads only the 
most basic functionality for things like the keyboard and 
mouse, and displays a different screen from what you’re 
used to seeing. Figure 16-1 provides additional informa-
tion. For details, see Chapter 17.
 
2. When you have Windows running in this limited mode, 
undo the changes you just made.
 
3. Restart the computer.
Uninstall a Problematic Program
 
1. Follow the appropriate step for your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪Control Panel to 
open the Control Panel window; then double-click 
the Add or Remove Programs icon to open the 
Add or Remove Programs window.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Choose Start➪Control 
Panel to open the Control Panel window. Then (in 
Classic View) select Programs and Features or (in

Category View) select Uninstall a Program in the 
Programs category. Either action opens the 
Uninstall or Change a Program window.
Use Windows Help at any time to learn more about Windows topics.
Figure 16-1
 
2. Select the program that you want to remove.
 
 If you’re not certain that this program is causing the 
problem, you could try the repair option in Windows 
7 first. If that doesn’t work, proceed with the 
uninstallation.

➟

Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
 
3. Click the button titled something like Change/Remove, 
Uninstall/Change, or Uninstall. The name of this button 
or option may differ from program to program. Some 
programs provide a Change button that opens a separate 
utility in which you can modify or remove the program; 
others offer a Remove button that does just that. Still 
other programs have a single button called Change/
Remove that offers a more complex set of options. Figure 
16-2 shows one program’s response after the Uninstall/
Change button is clicked.
Click Uninstall to start the process.
Figure 16-2
 
4. Follow the onscreen instructions to remove the program. 
When the selected program is removed, you should see a 
confirmation dialog box like the one shown in Figure 16-3.
Click OK to close the confirmation dialog box.

 Chapter 16: Restoring Your Computer’s Settings
Choose the Right Utility to Solve Your Problem
When all else fails, the next step is restoring earlier settings on your 
computer. Windows has two built-in utilities for this purpose: System 
Restore and Last Known Good Configuration. I cover both later in this 
chapter. To decide which to use, consider the primary differences:
 
➟ System Restore can be used only on a PC that can 
start in Windows in either normal or safe mode (see 
Chapter 17).
 
➟ Last Known Good Configuration can be invoked 
during the startup process and may be able to bring 
to life a PC that otherwise can’t load Windows.
 
➟ You can undo changes made with System Restore by 
repeating the process, going back to the settings that 
were in effect before the restore, or trying a different 
date in the hope of getting a different result.
 
➟ Changes made through Last Known Good 
Configuration are permanent and cannot be undone.
 
 System Restore and Last Known Good Configuration 
restore only system settings; they don’t affect data 
files, e-mail, or applications. Also, neither utility 
repairs or replaces a deleted or corrupted driver or 
program. To make that sort of fix, you need to rein-
stall the driver or program from the original source 
or from an online source.
Reset Your PC with System Restore
System Restore, featured in all current version of Windows, is a com-
puter version of a time warp, allowing you to go back from the future 
to a specific restore point — a group of settings that were in effect last 

➟
268
Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
night, last week, or at some other time. By default, it creates restore 
points automatically every day, but you can also create them at any 
time (see the “Create a Restore Point Manually” section for your ver-
sion of Windows, later in this chapter). System Restore is most likely 
to work if you use it immediately after you notice problems.
 
 You can use System Restore to reset your computer 
only if you’ve previously turned this feature on. 
There’s really no reason not to use it, because it’s 
enabled as part of a standard Windows installation.
 
1. Save any open files on your computer, and close all 
programs.
 
2. Make sure that you have current backups of essential 
data files.
 
3. Launch System Restore in any of the following ways:
 
• Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7: Choose 
Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
System Restore.
 
• Vista only: Click the Start button, type system 
restore in the Search box, and then click the 
utility’s name in the search results.
 
• Windows 7 only: Click the Start button, type 
system restore in the Search box, and then click 
Restore Your Computer to an Earlier Time.
 
 The resulting window asks whether you want to create a 
restore point (set one manually) or choose a previously 
recorded restore point. Figure 16-4 shows this window in 
Windows XP; the Vista and Windows 7 windows are 
slightly different.

 Don’t go too far back in time. Going farther back 
than necessary could disable good updates and 
changes that you made before the problem started. 
Try using restore points created just before problems 
started. If the first restore doesn’t work, go farther 
back.
 
6. Click the Next button. The computer chugs along for a 
few moments, preparing the information it needs, and 
then restarts.
 
7. When your PC restarts, follow the appropriate step:
 
• Successful restoration: If the restoration is suc-
cessful, you see a screen like the one shown in 
Figure 16-9 when Windows loads. Click the Finish 
button to close System Restore.

• Failed restoration: If the restoration fails, your 
computer restarts in the same condition it was in 
before you attempted to fix it. Repeat Steps 3–6 
with a different restore point.
 
 To undo restoration changes, open System Restore; 
select the Undo System Restore radio button (see 
Figure 16-10); and click Next. You won’t see the 
option to undo a system restore until you’ve done 
a system restore.

Revert to the Last Known Good Configuration
Last Known Good Configuration restores the settings that were in 
effect the last time the computer started successfully. It’s not quite the 
same as System Restore (see “Reset Your PC with System Restore,” ear-
lier in this chapter), which you can invoke days or weeks later to reset 
a computer to an earlier configuration.

 This tool should be your first line of defense if you 
just installed a new piece of hardware or software 
and find that the computer won’t restart properly.
 
1. Remove any discs from the CD and/or DVD drives that 
may be part of your system.
 
2. Restart your computer.
 
3. As the computer comes to life — and before the 
Windows logo appears — repeatedly press and release 
the F8 function key. In a moment, the somewhat-scary 
Last Known Good Configuration screen should appear 
(see Figure 16-12).
 
 If the Windows logo appears instead, you’ve missed 
your moment. Wait until Windows has loaded fully; 
then shut down and restart to try again.
Press the arrow keys in your keyboard to select this option.

4. At this stage of the process, your mouse won’t work, so 
use the arrow keys to highlight Last Known Good 
Configuration; then press the Enter key.
 
5. If you have more than one version of Windows installed 
on your PC, you see options for each version; choose the 
version that you want to restart. After you make your 
selection, your PC restarts in the selected version of 
Windows.
 
6. Inspect Windows applications, and test whatever caused 
you to choose this option in the first place to see whether 
you corrected the problem.

Working in Safe 
Mode
S
afe mode is like putting your car up on a lift 
at the garage. When you run a computer in 
this mode, you can start it, test most of its sys-
tems, and change certain settings, but you’re not 
going to get much use out of it until you bring it 
back down to Earth . . . and normal operations.
Safe mode is an excellent way to determine the 
source of problems:
 ➟ If you can start your PC in safe mode, its 
basic hardware probably isn’t the cause 
of your problem. Instead, the problem 
may involve settings or configurations 
that you recently made (see Chapter 4 
and the chapters in Part IV), new devices 
that you recently added (see Part III), an 
electrical problem (see Chapter 9), or 
malware (see Chapter 6).
 ➟ If you can’t start your PC in safe mode, 
you have a problem with basic hardware 
(see Part III) or the basic elements of 
Windows (see Part IV).
 ➟ If your PC starts in safe mode all by 
itself, some component is preventing 
normal startup. For help, see the “Test 
Components and Settings in Safe Mode” 
section of this chapter.

Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
In this chapter, I show you how to use safe mode to diagnose — and 
often fix — your computer’s problems.
Start Your Computer in Safe Mode
 
1. Remove any discs from the CD/DVD drive, if your PC 
has one.
 
2. Shut down your computer in one of the following ways:
 
• If you can see enough of the screen to follow the 
standard Windows shutdown procedure, do that.
 
• If you can’t do a normal shutdown, press the 
Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination and then release the 
keys. (Whether you can see it or not, you’re dis-
playing Windows Task Manager.) Next, press and 
release the Alt key; press the U key to select the 
Shut Down menu; and press the U key to turn off 
the computer. (This works in XP, but not in Vista 
or Windows 7.)
 
3. Wait a few moments to allow the computer to shut off 
fully; then restart. The computer begins processing its 
self-test, and you should be able to see messages on the 
screen, including advice on alternative ways to start the 
computer. When the self-test is complete, the computer 
pauses briefly before it begins to load Windows.
 
4. During this pause, repeatedly press and release the F8 
function key on the keyboard. Keep doing so until the 
Windows Advanced Options Menu screen appears (see 
Figure 17-1).

➟
281
 Chapter 17: Working in Safe Mode
Select the Safe Mode option.
Figure 17-1
 
 If you begin tapping the F8 key too soon, you’ll see a 
“keyboard error” message; restart the computer and 
try again. If you begin tapping too late, the computer 
will go on to load Windows, and you have to repeat 
the shutdown/startup process.
 
5. If you have more than one version of Windows installed 
on your computer, use the arrow keys to select the ver-
sion you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8; 
otherwise, go on to Step 6.
 
6. Press the arrow keys on the keyboard to highlight the 
Safe Mode option, and press Enter. The computer starts 
loading Windows in safe mode.
 
 When Windows is fully loaded in safe mode, you see a 
basic screen like the one shown in Figure 17-2 — probably 
using a smaller number of colors than you’re used to see-
ing, as well as lower resolution, and displaying the words 

➟

Safe Mode in the corners. (To make the display more 
legible, see “Make the Monitor Easier to Read in Safe 
Mode,” later in this chapter.)
Note the “Safe Mode” flags in the screen corners.
Figure 17-2
 
 The Safe Mode option starts Windows in a basic, lim-
ited mode. As you operate in this mode, you’ll dis-
cover things that you can’t do. You can select a more 
advanced option to perform additional troubleshoot-
ing, as I discuss in “Choose Advanced Safe Mode 
Options,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 17: Working in Safe Mode
Make the Monitor Easier to Read in Safe Mode
 
 By default, safe mode uses a screen resolution of 
800 x 600 pixels, but you can increase resolution to 
fit more on the screen and to produce a clearer 
display.
 
1. To change the monitor settings to make the screen easier 
to read in safe mode, follow the appropriate step for your 
version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪Control Panel to 
open the Control Panel window, and double-click 
the Display icon to open the Display Properties 
dialog box.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the desktop and 
choose Properties from the shortcut menu.
 
• Vista: Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
• Windows 7: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪
Appearance and Personalization and then click 
Display to open the Display dialog box.
  
2. Again, follow the appropriate step for your version of 
Windows:
 
• Windows XP and Vista: On the Settings tab, select 
Screen Resolution and Color Quality settings that 
work properly with your system, and click OK.
 
• Windows 7: Select the Medium or Larger radio 
button (see Figure 17-3), and click the Apply 
button.

➟
284
Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
 
 In Windows 7, you can right-click the desktop and 
choose Screen Resolution from the shortcut menu to 
adjust resolution, but you can’t change color settings 
or themes in safe mode.
Choose a level of magnification.

Use Safe Mode Tools
When you’ve restarted a troublesome computer in safe mode, you can 
use several diagnostic and repair tools to attempt a fix. (Slight varia-
tions in operation may occur among Windows XP, Vista, and 
Windows 7.) Here are some of the most valuable tools:

➟
285
 Chapter 17: Working in Safe Mode
 
➟ Plug and play: The availability of plug and play 
means that the computer can recognize most devices 
that are plugged in during or after start-up. Not all 
device drivers are available in safe mode, however. 
For more information on working with device 
drivers, see Chapter 4.
 
➟ Help and Support: Choose Start➪Help and Support 
to open the Help and Support window, which pro-
vides searchable instructions and troubleshooting 
tips for many elements of the system (see Figure 
17-4). In basic safe mode, however, networking and 
Internet access are disabled; to search on the Web 
for assistance, you have to choose the Safe Mode 
with Networking option during start-up (see 
“Choose Advanced Safe Mode Options,” later in 
this chapter).
 
➟ Device Manager: This tool allows you to update 
device drivers and configure hardware. For details on 
using Device Manager, see Chapter 18.
 
➟ System Restore: This utility lets you retrieve settings 
and other information stored in the computer at an 
earlier time. I cover System Restore in detail in 
Chapter 16.
 
➟ Command prompt: In certain circumstances — such 
as when a support professional tells you to do so — 
you may want to reach the command prompt to run 
a program that resides outside Windows. To display 
the prompt (see Figure 17-5), choose Start➪All 
Programs➪Accessories➪Command Prompt. Also see 
“Choose Advanced Safe Mode Options,” later in this 
chapter, for more information.

➟ Registry Editor: This tool is not for inexperienced or 
unguided users. You may need to use it, however, if 
a support professional directs you to make changes 
in your Windows Registry files. Follow his or her 
instructions carefully.
 
 Don’t make changes without backing up the previous 
set of files and without getting specific instructions 
about changes. A mistake in a critical section can ren-
der Windows unusable, requiring you to reinstall it.

Appearance and Personalization and then click 
Display to open the Display dialog box.
  
2. Again, follow the appropriate step for your version of 
Windows:
 
➟ Windows XP: On the Settings tab, restore the resolu-
tion and color settings that were in effect before you 
started having problems, and click OK.
 
➟ Vista and Windows 7: Click Adjust Resolution, 
make the necessary changes, and click OK.
 
 In Windows 7, you can’t adjust color settings in safe 
mode, but you can adjust screen resolution.
 
 Other system settings, such as network and sound-
card configuration, aren’t available in standard safe 
mode. See the next section for more options.

➟

 Chapter 17: Working in Safe Mode
Choose Advanced Safe Mode Options
 
1. Follow Steps 1–4 of “Start Your Computer in Safe Mode,” 
earlier in this chapter. In Windows XP and Vista, you see the 
Windows Advanced Options Menu screen; in Windows 7, 
you see the Advanced Boot Options Menu screen.
 
2. Use the arrow keys to select the option you want to use:
 
 In Windows 7 and Vista, a brief description appears 
at the bottom of the screen as you select each option.
 
• Repair Your Computer (Vista and Windows 7 
only): This option displays a list of system-recovery 
options, including tools you can use to diagnose 
your current problems. You’ll be asked to log in, 
after which you see a dialog box.
 
 If you don’t see this dialog box, it may mean that 
your computer’s manufacturer has supplied tools to 
replace these Microsoft utilities. Also, you may find 
these tools on your Windows CD but not on your 
hard drive.
 
• Safe Mode: This option (covered earlier in this 
chapter) loads Windows with a minimal set of 
drivers and services, permitting access to Control 
Panel and certain other utilities.
 
• Safe Mode with Networking: This option loads 
Windows in safe mode and also includes the stan-
dard set of drivers and services that you need to 
access the Internet or other computers on a network.
 
• Safe Mode with Command Prompt: This option 
loads Windows in safe mode but displays the 
command-prompt window instead of the usual 
Windows interface, permitting direct use of utili-
ties that run outside Windows.

➟
290
Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
 
• Enable Boot Logging: During the start-up process, 
this option creates a file listing all the drivers that 
load during start-up. Examining the file, which is 
called ntbtlog.txt, may offer clues for 
advanced troubleshooting.
 
• Enable VGA Mode (Windows XP and Vista) or 
Enable Low Resolution Video (Windows 7): This 
option loads Windows with the current video 
driver but with low-resolution, minimal settings. 
This option allows you to reset the display settings 
if they were intentionally or accidentally set out-
side the acceptable range for your hardware.
 
• Last Known Good Configuration: This option 
loads Windows with the last configuration that 
worked successfully. I cover it in detail in 
Chapter 16.
 
• Directory Services Restore Mode: This advanced 
option is for system administrators and advanced 
users, but a support professional may direct you to 
choose it. This option loads the Windows domain 
controller running Active Directory so that the 
directory service can be restored. You wouldn’t 
choose this option except under the direction of a 
Windows support professional.
 
• Debugging Mode: This option loads another 
advanced troubleshooting mode that lets you 
change certain elements of the Windows code 
itself. A support professional may direct you to 
choose this option, but don’t enter this mode by 
yourself.
 
• Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure: 
This option (see Figure 17-6) allows you to specify 
whether Windows will restart automatically if an 
error causes it to fail. Microsoft recommends that 

➟
291
 Chapter 17: Working in Safe Mode
you disable automatic restart if Windows is stuck 
in a loop in which it fails, attempts to restart, and 
fails again repeatedly.
 
• Disable Driver Signature Enforcement (Vista and 
Windows 7 only): This option allows drivers that 
contain improper or unverified signatures to be 
loaded.
 
• Start Windows Normally: This option, unlike the 
others in this menu, starts Windows in normal 
mode.
 
• Recovery Console (Windows XP) or View System 
Recovery Options (Vista): Choose this option to 
display a menu of recovery options that can help 
you solve problems related to start-up.
Disable automatic restart if Windows 
cycles and won’t start up properly.

Part IV: Resetting the Operating System 
 
 System Recovery Options is a suite of recovery and 
repair tools. You see this option only if these utilities 
have been installed on your hard drive. Otherwise, 
you can find them on your Vista CD. Depending on 
your computer brand, the manufacturer may have 
substituted another utility for this one.
 
• Reboot: This option lets you restart the system. 
Unless you press the F8 key to start in safe mode, 
this option restarts the computer normally.
 
• Return to OS Choices Menu: If your computer 
contains more than one version of Windows, this 
option returns you to the start-up menu so you 
can choose which version you want to launch.
 
3. Press Enter to start Windows in the selected mode.

D
evice Manager, a key component of the 
System utility in Control Panel, is a full-
time, officially licensed internal snoop and 
reporter. As its name tells you, its assignment is 
to manage the devices that do the work.
In addition, this utility gives you a window on 
the various hardware components that make 
up your computer. Here, devices are grouped 
according to their function. You can retrieve 
device names, view driver information, find 
out whether a device is working properly, 
enable or disable a device, and more. Device 
Manager is a valuable tool that helps you 
understand more about your computer system 
and troubleshoot hardware problems.
In this chapter, I show you how to use Device 
Manager to keep your system running 
smoothly — and how to troubleshoot device 
problems if you need more help.

Disable a Device
 
 Disabling a device (actually, disabling its device 
driver and its request for use of system resources) can 
be very helpful in tracking down the source of a 
problem with your computer or with Windows. 
When a potentially problematic device is disabled, 
you can see status reports and error messages that 
may assist you.
 
1. Launch Device Manager (see “Open Device Manager,” 
earlier in this chapter).
 
2. Click the plus sign (+) next to the device’s category to 
expand the listing (see Figure 18-6).
 
3. Double-click the device that you want to disable. The 
device’s Properties dialog box opens.
 
4. Follow the appropriate step for your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP and Vista: Click the General tab. In 
the Device Usage section at the bottom of the tab, 
choose Do Not Use This Device (Disable) from the 
drop-down menu (see Figure 18-7).
 
• Windows 7: Click the Driver tab, and choose 
Disable at the bottom of the tab.
 
 The wording of the disable option may differ slightly 
in various versions of Windows, but the effect is the 
same.
 
5. Click OK to apply the change and close the dialog box.
 
6. If you don’t see an immediate change in your computer’s 
operation, restart your PC to allow all the installed 
devices to make their presences known to Device 
Manager.

9. If you’re installing a new driver in an attempt to solve a 
problem, restart your computer after installation, and test 
the problem device.
 
 It’s a good idea to set a new restore point before 
installing new software so that you can revert to the 
earlier configuration if necessary. For details, see

Relieving Hard 
Times for Hard 
Drives
T
he hard disk drive in your computer is a 
mechanical device, kind of like a lawn-
mower, a food processor, or a record player 
(remember those?). Like all mechanical 
devices, it has a limited life expectancy.
If you’re unlucky, your drive will die suddenly. 
If you’re lucky, it will break down slowly over 
a long period. Make no mistake, though: 
Someday, your hard drive will die. That’s why 
it’s important to check its health regularly and 
keep it in the best possible shape.
You can do several things to check and main-
tain your drive:
 ➟ Use an automated maintenance utility 
provided by the drive maker or a third-
party software company
  ➟ Perform a manual check with mainte-
nance tools that are built into Windows
 ➟ Defragment the drive
 ➟ Check for disk errors

Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
The one thing you should not do is ignore any developing issue.
In this chapter, I show you how to tune up your hard drive and keep it 
running as long as possible.
Defragment the Drive with Windows’ 
Defragmenting Tool
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
Disk Defragmenter to display the Disk Defragmenter 
dialog box (see Figure 19-1).
Click here for more information.
Click here to set up an automatic defragmenting
 schedule in Vista and Windows 7.
Click here to start defragmenting.
Figure 19-1

➟
309
 Chapter 19: Relieving Hard Times for Hard Drives
 
2. Select the drive that you want to defragment.
 
 For most users, the main hard drive is designated the 
C: drive; it contains Windows, your applications, and 
your data. This drive has the most storage. You may 
also see a much smaller D: drive, which likely con-
tains the files you would use to restore your computer 
to factory settings in the event of a problem. You 
don’t want to alter anything on this recovery drive.
 
3. Click Defragment (Windows XP) or Defragment Disk 
(Vista and Windows 7). The defragmenter analyzes the 
disk for degree of fragmentation and then begins the 
defragmentation process.
 
 In Windows XP, you see a graphical display that repre-
sents the hard drive before and after defragmentation. In 
Vista and Windows 7, you see a countdown of the per-
centage of defragmentation completed.
 
4. When the process is complete, close Disk Defragmenter 
by choosing File➪Exit (Windows XP) or by clicking the 
Close button (Vista and Windows 7).
 
 In Windows 7 and Vista, you can configure Disk 
Defragmenter to run on a schedule, which keeps your 
hard drive tuned up and efficient without your hav-
ing to think about it.
 
 Don’t allow your drives to become so full that a 
defragmentation tool — either the built-in Windows 
tool or a third-party product (see the next section) — 
has little or no room to rearrange files. In most cases, 
you shouldn’t fill a drive to more than 85 percent of 
its capacity; that means leaving at least 15 percent 
available for the utility. Delete junk or move some 
files to external storage if you need to open space.

➟
310
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
Defragment the Drive with a Third-Party Utility
Why spend money for a tool that does the same thing as Disk 
Defragmenter? Third-party defraggers provide extra bells and whistles 
that may be worth paying for. Here are a few of the best third-party 
defragmentation utilities:
 
➟ Norton 360 and Norton Systemworks 
(www.symantec.com)
 
➟ Diskeeper Professional (www.diskeeper.com; 
see Figure 19-2)
Color-coded defragmentation analysis
Figure 19-2

➟
311
 Chapter 19: Relieving Hard Times for Hard Drives
 
 If you use a scheduled defragmentation tool such as 
the one built into Windows 7 (as opposed to one that 
works in the background, like the Norton products 
and Diskeeper), you’ll get better and faster results if 
you turn off your computer’s Internet connection 
while the program is running. Otherwise, new e-mail 
and other automatic activities that bring files to your 
computer will slow the process — sometimes to the 
point at which the tool has to start all over again.
Check for Disk Errors Automatically
 
1. Choose Start➪My Computer or Start➪Computer to open 
the My Computer/Computer window.
 
2. Right-click the drive you want to check, and choose 
Properties from the shortcut menu to open the drive’s 
Properties dialog box.
 
3. Check the General tab for information about your drive, 
such as total capacity and free space (see Figure 19-3). A 
drive that is 99 percent full may not report errors, but it 
may act like it has hardware problems. If so, delete some 
files to make more room.
 
4. Click the Tools tab, and click the Check Now button. The 
Check Disk dialog box opens (see Figure 19-4).
 
5. Select one or both of the following options:
 
• Automatically Fix File System Errors: If this box 
is checked, the utility will examine all the files, 
folders, and indexes on the drive and repair most 
basic problems that it finds.

• Scan for and Attempt Recovery of Bad Sectors: If 
this box is checked, the utility will examine the 
magnetic sector markings on the surface of the 

➟
313
 Chapter 19: Relieving Hard Times for Hard Drives
disk, looking for any that are corrupted, incorrect, 
or damaged. If possible, the utility will repair dam-
aged sector marking. If that portion of the disk is 
damaged, the utility may be able to place an elec-
tronic fence around the sector so that your PC 
doesn’t attempt to place new information there.
 
6. Click the Start button to begin the scan. If you selected 
the automatic-check option in Step 5, Windows displays 
a message that the check can’t be performed while you’re 
using the disk and asks whether you want the utility to 
check the disk the next time you restart your PC.
 
7. Follow the appropriate step for your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Click Yes to tell Windows to check 
your disk at the next restart.
 
• Vista and Windows 7: Click Schedule Disk Check.
 
 If your Vista or Windows 7 computer is set up to 
have an administrator perform certain functions, 
you’ll be asked to enter an administrator password at 
this point. Most home and small-business PCs, how-
ever, aren’t set up to be managed by an 
administrator.
 
 If you chose Scan for and Attempt Recovery of Bad 
Sectors in Step 5, you can continue to work on your com-
puter, if you want, while the test is under way. You can 
get some idea of the status of the checkup by watching 
the slow advance of the progress bars onscreen, but don’t 
expect a play-by-play report.
 
 At the end of the scan, Windows will report whether or 
not errors were found and corrected. If you opted to 
schedule an automatic check on the next restart, 

➟
314
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
Windows reports that a disk check has been scheduled, 
gives you a chance to cancel, and then goes about run-
ning the Check Disk utility.
 
 You don’t have to check for disk errors every day, but 
you should do it every few months or whenever you 
notice erratic behavior that may be disk-related.
Check for Disk Errors Manually with Chkdsk
 
 This method takes a side trip out of Windows into 
the dark recesses of the command prompt — the 
mostly hidden vestige of the PC’s ancestral operating 
system — via a utility called Chkdsk. This text-based 
utility will be familiar to old-time computer users. 
Welcome to the past.
 
1. Follow the appropriate step for your version of Windows:
 
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪Run to display the 
dialog box, type cmd in the Open text box, and 
click OK.
 
• Vista: Click the Start button, type cmd in the 
Search Programs and Files field, and press Enter. 
Windows opens a dialog box displaying the mes-
sage This task will be created with 
Administrative privileges. Click OK.
 
• Windows 7: Click the Start button, type cmd in 
the Search Programs and Files field, and press 
Enter. Right-click cmd in the search-results win-
dow, and choose Run as Administrator from the 
shortcut menu. When Windows asks permission to 
make changes in User Access Control, click Yes.

➟
315
 Chapter 19: Relieving Hard Times for Hard Drives
 
 Whichever method you use, the command-prompt 
window opens.
 
 You won’t be able to work on your computer while 
this utility is running.
 
2. Enter one of the following commands:
 
• To view detailed information about your hard 
drive, type chkdsk driveletter: and then press 
Enter. (You enter the drive letter in place of 
driveletter. To check drive C:, for example, type 
the command chkdsk c:.)
 
• To find and repair errors, locate bad sectors, and 
recover readable information that may have been 
lost to an application, type chkdsk driveletter:/r 
and then press Enter. (Substitute the actual drive 
letter for driveletter. To check drive C:, for example, 
type chkdsk c:/r.)
 
 Programs such as chkdsk can be executed (run) with 
command switches that tell the program to conduct 
special tasks. You enter a switch after the program 
name, preceded by a slash (/). The /r switch, for 
example, tells Chkdsk to find and repair errors.
 
 If the current drive is in use (which is often the case 
in a PC that has just one drive), Chkdsk informs you 
that it can’t run the test with the specified repairs 
now and offers to conduct it the next time the com-
puter starts. Type Y (for yes) and then press Enter. 
The next time you start your computer, Chkdsk will 
run its test before Windows loads.
 
3. Wait for Chkdsk to finish doing its thing and display 
details on what it found (see Figure 19-5).

➟

error-fix switch that’s included in the /r switch, which I discuss earlier 
in this section.)
3
Chkdsk couldn’t check the disk or couldn’t fix errors because the /f 
switch wasn’t specified.
 
4. What you do next depends on the result of the test. If 
you asked Chkdsk to fix errors, for example, it may dis-
play an exit code or ask for verification before it performs 
a repair or recovery task. To continue the process, type Y 
and then press Enter.

➟

5. Type exit and press Enter to close the command-prompt 
window.
 
 Again, if Windows is using one or more of the files 
on the hard drive, you see the following message: 
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume 
is in use by another process. Would 
you like to schedule this volume to 
be checked the next time the system 
restarts? (Y/N) Type Y and press Enter to 
schedule the disk check; then restart your computer.
Take Out the Garbage with Disk Cleanup
 
1. Choose Start➪My Computer or Start➪My Computer to 
open the My Computer/Computer window.
 
2. Right-click the drive you want to check, and choose 
Properties from the shortcut menu to open the drive’s 
Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 19-3, earlier in this 
chapter).
 
3. Click the General tab, if it isn’t already open.
 
4. If you want, check the Compress This Drive to Save Disk 
Space check box. This option compresses old files that 
you haven’t used for a while.
 
 Choosing the Compress option generally is a good 
idea, although some users (including me) would 
rather not touch older files and compensate by add-
ing more storage. (See Chapter 11 for details on add-
ing or replacing a hard drive.)
 
5. Click the Disk Cleanup button. The system churns away 
for a while, examining your drive and calculating how 
much garbage it can locate.

➟
318
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
 
 Finally, the Disk Cleanup dialog box opens (see Figure 
19-6), indicating how much junk is sitting around in 
places like the folders for downloaded program files, 
temporary Internet files, and the Recycle Bin, and sug-
gesting files to delete.
Disk space that will be recovered
if you delete these files
Figure 19-6
 
6. Clear the check boxes next to any files that you want to 
keep; check the check boxes next to any additional files 
that you want to clear off the disk.
 
 For most users, it’s best to delete only the recom-
mended files. If you choose to go further, click each 
file and read its description before proceeding.

➟
319
 Chapter 19: Relieving Hard Times for Hard Drives
 
7. Click OK.
 
8. When Windows asks you to confirm that you want to 
delete these files permanently, click Yes (Windows XP) or 
Delete Files (Vista and Windows 7).
 
 How often you should run the Disk Cleanup utility 
depends on your habits. If you do a lot of Internet 
browsing, and disk space is running low, run the util-
ity. Otherwise, every few months is probably often 
enough.

when things go awry, the first thing to do 
is round up the usual suspects. The same is 
true for computers. Although there are 
uncountable possible combinations of hard-

Start a Computer That Won’t Start
 
1. Check the computer’s power source and connections.
 
• Make certain that the power cord is plugged into 
the computer and into a source of power. The 
power cord runs from the back of the computer 
and plugs into an electrical socket in the wall; into 
a surge protector (a good thing); or (even better) 
into an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), 
which is basically a large battery that is continu-
ously recharged by wall current (see Figure 20-1).
Figure 20-1
 
• Test the source of power to see whether it’s live. To 
do that, plug a lamp, radio, or fan into the same 
outlet, surge protector, or UPS that you’re using for 

➟
323
 Chapter 20: Fixing Common Problems
your computer, and see whether that device works 
properly. If not, the wall outlet may have blown a 
fuse or the surge protector may have failed (which 
is its job if a power spike comes along). For more 
details on dealing with a power problem, see 
Chapter 9.
 
• Try an alternative source of power, such as a differ-
ent wall socket. Then turn the computer back on 
and hope for a return to normalcy.
 
2. Push the start button or click the power switch, and listen 
for the computer’s cooling fan. A silent machine plugged 
into a live power outlet may indicate a failure in the 
power supply or circuitry. For details on replacing a failed 
power supply (or directing a technician to do it for you), 
see Chapter 9.
 
3. Listen and watch for beeps, other alert tones, or flashing 
lights on the front panel after the PC’s fan comes to life. 
These alerts during start-up (your computer’s instruction 
manual may explain them) may indicate a problem with 
internal hardware, such as memory or the hard disk 
drive. If you need to replace hardware, turn to Part III.
 
 If you just installed new memory or made other 
changes inside the case, the sound or light codes may 
be telling you that something went wrong with your 
work. Try removing whatever you just installed and 
returning the computer to the condition it was in 
before you touched the hardware (see Chapter 16).
 
4. Watch for onscreen messages before Windows is loaded. 
These messages could warn you of a hardware failure or 
an error resulting from a problem with setup 
instructions.

➟
324
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
 
 Sometimes, you can get past a hardware error by 
instructing Windows to open in safe mode (see 
Chapter 17), which loads only the most critical com-
ponents of Windows. If Windows will load this way, 
you can check Device Manager for clues about which 
component failed; for details, see Chapter 18.
Solve Basic Hardware Problems
 
➟ Your computer is suddenly silent. Make sure you 
haven’t muted the sound. The sound card or adapter 
inside your PC has failed or is no longer adequate 
for your needs.
 
 Solution: Instead of opening the case, plug in an 
external sound adapter such as Creative’s USB 
SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External, which attaches to 
a USB port on almost any desktop or laptop 
computer.
 
➟ Your PC needs new or better wireless capability. 
You want to give your computer the ability to com-
municate wirelessly with other devices, or you need 
to upgrade an outdated or malfunctioning built-in 
Wi-Fi adapter.
 
 Solution: Several manufacturers offer external Wi-Fi 
adapters and antennas that connect to your PC 
through (you’re getting the pattern here, right?) the 
USB port. One advantage of using an external Wi-Fi 
adapter is that it usually comes with a more substan-
tial antenna than its internal equivalent, and you can 
adjust the placement of that antenna to get the best 
transmission and reception in your home or office. 
The latest “N” Wi-Fi technology adapters, like the 
one shown in Figure 20-2, have a small footprint 
and offer better coverage than earlier models do.

➟ You can’t install programs on a computer with no 
CD/DVD drive. If you own a minimalist netbook or 
a small desktop computer, the tiny size and low cost 
often come at the expense of things like a CD/DVD 
drive. But without a CD/DVD drive, how do you 
install new programs?
 
 Solution: A couple of simple work-arounds are 
available:
 
• Use the Internet. The first and most obvious solu-
tion is to download programs or data over the 
Internet or across a local area network, or to use a 
device such as a flash memory drive to transfer 
program content to the computer. You can pur-
chase very large flash drives to store up to 256GB 
worth of programs or data. Figure 20-3, for exam-
ple, shows a Kingston 128GB USB flash drive. 
Old-timers like me find it hard to believe that you 
can get so much storage in such a small package.
Figure 20-3
 
• Install an external CD/DVD drive. Another 
option is to install an external drive. Drives of this 
type are small units, similar to those used in full-
feature laptops, that draw electrical power from

the USB port. (For details on external drives, see 
Chapter 11.) Figure 20-4 shows a typical external 
CD/DVD drive that can read and write discs.

Troubleshoot Common Windows Woes
  
➟ Windows is damaged. The version of Windows 
installed on your PC has become damaged, and your 
only option seems to be a clean reinstallation. First 
consider which applications you really need to keep 
and use after this process; then make sure that you 
have the original installation discs for these 
programs.
 
 Solution: Follow these steps:

➟
328
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
 
1. Plug in an external hard drive as an additional storage 
device. If the drive has been formatted and includes 
any data (virtually all modern drives are configured 
for plug-and-play installation), Windows will ask your 
intentions (see Figure 20-5).
Select an option if necessary, and click OK.
Figure 20-5
 
2. If the drive is new, all you want to do is make it avail-
able to Windows, so you don’t need to select an 
option; simply click OK.
 
3. Use Windows Explorer to copy all your data from the 
internal drive to the external drive.
 
4. Repartition and reformat the internal drive, and rein-
stall Windows (all covered in Chapter 11).
 
5. Restart your PC.
 
6. When Windows is up and running properly, copy 
your data files on the external drive back to the inter-
nal drive.

➟
329
 Chapter 20: Fixing Common Problems
 
7. Reinstall any applications that you want to use. 
(Unfortunately, when you reformat a drive and rein-
stall Windows, you lose your other applications.)
 
 You may want to keep the external drive attached 
and use it to store backup copies of your data files.
 
➟ After you install a new program, Windows stops 
working properly. The new program may be 
incompatible with your version of Windows. Restart 
Windows in safe mode, uninstall the program, and 
then contact the manufacturer to see whether it offers 
a later version of the program (or a patch that makes 
it compatible with your version of Windows). For 
more information on safe mode, see Chapter 17; for 
details on uninstalling software, turn to Chapter 4.
 
➟ After you install a new piece of hardware, 
Windows no longer works properly. The most 
likely culprit is a device driver that’s incompatible 
with your version of Windows or that conflicts with 
a driver for a different piece of hardware. Try unin-
stalling and reinstalling the driver, and check for a 
new version that may be more compatible with your 
system. For details on checking for device conflicts, 
see Chapter 18.

Solve Basic Software Problems
 
➟ After you install a new program or change your 
Windows settings, your computer freezes. 
Evidently, the new software has something to do 
with the problem.

➟
330
Part V: Troubleshooting Your PC 
 
 Solution: Try restarting the PC to see whether the 
problem goes away after restart. If not, use 
System Restore (see Chapter 16) to return your 
computer to the configuration it was in before 
you made the change. Figure 20-6 shows the 
System Restore screen in which you choose which 
restore point to use.
Send your PC back in time by selecting one of these restore points.
Figure 20-6
 
 Another option is to restart your computer in safe 
mode, undo your most recent changes in Control 
Panel, restart again, and allow Windows to load 
normally. For more information, see “Undo 
Something You Just Did” in Chapter 16.

program conflict can cause applications to lose their 
minds, so to speak. You could be experiencing a 
hardware failure (see “Solve Basic Hardware 
Problems,” earlier in this chapter), a problem with 
Windows (see “Troubleshoot Common Windows 
Woes,” earlier in this chapter), or issues between the 
application and Windows.
 
 Solution: Try these fixes:
 
• If the program will open, and you can access its 
menus, look for a software-update option (proba-
bly in the File or Help menu). Windows conducts 
periodic automatic updates unless you’ve disabled 
this feature. An older application could resist a 
major Windows update by refusing to run 
properly.
 
• If you can’t find an update option in any menus, 
check the manufacturer’s Web site, where you may 
be able to download and install the latest software 
version.
 
• Remove the program; then reinstall it from the 
original discs. See Chapter 4 for details on how to 
uninstall a program.
Get Back on the Internet
 
1. Let Windows help you solve the problem.
 
• If you attempt to connect to a Web page and get a 
message similar to the one shown in Figure 20-7, 
click More Information for help.
 
• Click Diagnose Connection Problems.

Internet connection, depending on the browser 
you’re using.
 
2. Make sure that your Internet connection is still active. If 
you have a cable or DSL modem, an indicator light 
should tell you whether the service is active.
 
• Cable modem: If you use a cable modem, also 
check to see whether any television sets connected 
to the line are getting a video signal.

 Chapter 20: Fixing Common Problems
 
• DSL modem: If you use a DSL modem, see 
whether any telephones attached to the line have a 
dial tone.
 
 If your service seems to be working properly, the problem 
may be caused by a momentary electrical glitch in the sig-
nal that can lock up the modem. Proceed to Step 3.
 
3. Try a power reset, as follows:
 
a. Close your Web browser and other programs on your 
computer.
 
b. Remove the power cord from the modem (and, if you 
use one, from the router).
 
c. Wait about 10 seconds.
 
d. Restore the power to the modem (and router, if appli-
cable), and wait until all the indicator lights come 
back on.
 
e. Open your Web browser, and see whether Internet 
access has been restored.
 
4. If you still don’t have Internet access, and the modem 
indicator light still shows problems, call your Internet 
service provider’s support desk for assistance.
 
 If the support person tries to avoid helping you — 
perhaps by claiming that the problem is in the 
internal wiring of your home or office, or that 
your computer is malfunctioning or improperly 
configured — insist that he or she help you solve 
the problem. One way to get the company’s atten-
tion: Tell the support representative that you’re pre-
pared to cancel your service because you can’t get

5. If you still don’t have Internet access after Step 3, but the 
modem’s indicator light shows that the service is working 
properly, retrace your steps. Have you made any changes 
in Windows or installed any new programs since the last 
time your PC linked up properly to the Web? If so, 
restore the previous settings manually or with System 
Restore (see Chapter 16).
