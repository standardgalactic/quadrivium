About the Authors
Woody Leonhard first described himself as an “Office victim” shortly after Microsoft
released the inaugural version of Office. The kvetch stuck. Woody started his computer
book writing career more than a decade ago with a compilation of bugs and
workarounds in Word for Windows version 1.10, and he’s been dishing out advice and
digging the ’Softie dirt ever since. 
This book continues in the footsteps of Windows XP Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies, Woody’s best-selling compendium of real-world help for the Windows hapless.
Woody also wrote the best-seller Windows XP All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies,
and dozens of earlier tomes, many of which still rate as required reading on Microsoft’s
Redmond campus.
Susan Sales Harkins contributed the Techniques on Access. She’s written for the
Woody’s Access Watch newsletters on many occasions, and is one of the smartest data-
base people Woody knows. She is also is an independent consultant and the author of
several articles and books on database and Web technologies. Her most recent books
are: ICDL Practice Questions Exam Cram 2, ICDL Exam Cram 2,  Absolute Beginner’s Guide
to Microsoft Access 2003, Absolute Beginner’s Guide to Microsoft Access 2002, all from Que;
Mastering Dreamweaver MX Databases, from Sybex; and SQL: Access to SQL Server, from
Apress. You can reach Susan at ssharkins@bellsouth.net. Currently, Susan volunteers
as the Publications Director for Database Advisors at www.databaseadvisors.com. 


Dedication
To Add and her heart of gold, for all she has done for me and Justin over the years. 
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Justin Leonhard for his help with this book. Justin lives with his dad and bea-

game player, Justin was admitted to Mensa International at the age of 14, but occasion-
ally forgets to watch out for monkeys tossing coconuts.

Introduction
D
o you use Microsoft Office? Or does Office use you?
That is the question.
Most people sit down at a computer, click a couple of times, and start
typing. They rarely take the initiative to make Office work better, not
knowing (or perhaps not caring!) that a few minutes spent upfront wran-
gling with the beast can save hours, or even days, down the road.
Chime in any time. Do you spend a lot of time working with Office appli-
cations? Have you ever felt the frustration of typing something and hav-
ing it mangled by a program that thinks it’s smarter than you? Maybe
you’ve lost an hour or a day or a week to a PC that just doesn’t behave
the way any rational machine should. And then wondered why it’s all so
ludicrously complicated. If you’ve ever been so mad you could put your
fist through the screen . . . this book’s for you.
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
— Hamlet, III, i
Hey, face it — you or your company paid a bundle for Office. Office is
supposed to save you time — not suck it up in voracious gulps. Isn’t it
about time that you started to get your money’s worth?
About This Book
Microsoft says that 400,000,000 people use Office.
Astounding, huh?

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you know how to use a computer, how
to get Windows running, and how to perform basic
mouse functions. In fact, that’s the first way I save
you time: I won’t cover old ground.
I also assume that you’re not scared to change Office
settings. After all, they’re your settings. You can
change them any way that you want.
An example. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access all
maintain lists of most recently used files. When you
open the File menu, the list of files appears at the
bottom of the menu. Unless you change each spe-
cific program, you’ll see only four files listed at the
bottom of the File menu. Some people figure that
four files are listed by default because some behav-
ioral science genius at Microsoft discovered that
four was the optimum number. Ain’t so. In fact, the
default with a meager list of four files came about
years ago when somebody decided that any more
than four files (run on an ancient monitor at 640 x
480 resolution) produced a screen too complicated
for the average Office user to understand.
That’s why you only see four recently used files.
Urban legend debunked.
Office comes loaded with dumb defaults that you
should change — immediately! — whenever you
start working on a new machine. More than any-
thing, I assume that you’re willing to take the bull
by the horns.
What’s in This Book
To save you time, I organized this book into
Techniques — groups of related tasks that make
you or your computer (or possibly both!) more
efficient and more effective. Some Techniques are
short ’n sweet, tackle one specific topic, and get you
in and out of Office in a nonce. Other Techniques
depend on a deeper understanding of how Office
If you’re like me, you spend most of your working
day — indeed, most of your waking hours —
wrestling with Office.
Although tamable, the Office beast is getting worse.
Trying to capitalize on Office’s familiar (read: ubiqui-
tous) user interface, Microsoft is attempting to get
application program developers to coax Office appli-
cations to interact with normal people like you and
me. No doubt you’ve seen demos of ordering systems
that look like Word documents or Web pages that
act like Excel spreadsheets. In the not-too-distant
future, you won’t be able to send a handwritten note
to school with your kid: You’ll have to log on to the
school’s Web site and submit a Word form.
The simple fact is that you need to know how to use
Office in order to get your work done. And the more
guff that Office gives you, the harder it is to find time
for the important stuff.
Office 2003 Timesaving Techniques For Dummies
will save you time, day in and day out, by explaining
how to

Customize Office to meet your needs: These
Techniques make Word, Outlook, Excel,
PowerPoint, and Access work faster, more
like the way you work, with less intrusion
than you ever thought possible.

Tame time-sucking everyday tasks and take
your skills up a notch: Like its predecessor,
Windows XP Timesaving Techniques For Dummies,
this book isn’t limited to dry click this, press that
tips. Rather, it goes outside the traditional com-
puter box to solve real-world problems that
Office 2003 users encounter every day. Find out
which tools work best for specific tasks and dive
into some of the more advanced Office skills, like
writing macros, setting up templates, and even
modifying standard windows. 
Although this book is written specifically for
Office 2003, most of the Techniques here apply
equally well to Office XP and (in many cases)
Office 2000. Where differences exist, I point them
out, typically at the end of the Technique.

works. Take your time when you go through the
more complex Techniques, and you’ll be rewarded
with big gains down the road. No two people work
the same way. Why should computers?
When a Technique requires you to perform a series
of steps, I take you through them in a very direct
way. But some big timesavers aren’t complicated at
all. Keep your eye out for shorter tips, sidebars, and
timesavers that are tangentially related to the main
topic at hand. Watch for the icons. And don’t be sur-
prised if you bump into a tip or two that urges you
to change how you work, as opposed to making
changes to your computer.
This book continues the easy-to-read, two-column for-
mat that was pioneered in Windows XP Timesaving
Techniques For Dummies. It’s full of figures and other
visual cues that make it easier for you to scan and
enter a Technique at the point most appropriate for
your circumstances. Linear thinking is good. Non-
linear scanning is better: That is, wade in at the topic
you need help on . . . no need to read this tome cover
to cover.
Lay this book flat so you that can see exactly
what you’re doing. Yes, the book was made to
stay put.
You can read the book from beginning to end, or
you can jump directly into the Technique of your
choice. Either way works just fine. Any time a con-
cept is mentioned that isn’t covered in-depth in that
Technique, you’ll find a cross-reference to another
Technique to find out more. If you’re looking for
something specific, check out either the Table of
Contents or the index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book lists
my choices as the most important quick timesaving
Techniques. Tear it out, tape it to your monitor,
and/or pass it around to other folks at the office.
We’re all in this leaky boat together.
Here’s a quick guide to the meat of the book:
Part I: Knocking Office Into Shape
What you need to do to Office (and Windows!) to take
off the training wheels. Here you discover how to
make Windows a safe place for Office and get at
your Office programs faster. Organize Office docu-
ments in ways that make sense for you, and then
customize the Open dialog box’s Places Bar so that
finding files is a snap. Delve into how to set up a
backup regimen and stick to it. And don’t miss
downloading and installing the latest patches — 
and knowing when not to. Go on to disable the really
obnoxious IntelliSense setting that converts typed
Web address and e-mail addresses into links and use
the Office Clipboard with aplomb. Then work with
graphics in all the Office applications and streamline
your toolbars.
Part II: Saving Time with Word
For most people, timesaving gains in Word have the
biggest impact. You gotta read here to discover how
to turn off all those stupid IntelliSense settings. Use
Word’s features to lay out a page that works with
you and not against you. Print impressive labels.
Read about ways to edit that really work. Use Find
and Replace and unleash the truth behind styles.
Stick with me to create top-notch letterhead and
tame Word’s graphics.
Part III: Streamlining Outlook
Do you live in Outlook? Here’s what you don’t know. I
show you here how to set up meaningful search fold-
ers and organize with quick clicks. Keep Outlook
from autocompleting your way into oblivion. Fight
spam before it happens. Finally, look at files attached
to e-mail messages — without getting infected —
and share Calendars and Contacts.
Part IV: Exploiting Excel
For crunching much more than numbers. Here you nav-
igate creating spreadsheets that check themselves
and make spreadsheets look better onscreen and

Conventions Used in This Book
I try to keep the typographical conventions to a
minimum:

The first time that a buzzword appears in text, I
italicize it and define it immediately. That makes
it easier for you to glance back and reread the
definition.

When you see an arrow (➪) in text, it means that
you should click, click, click to success. For
example, “Choose Tools➪Letters and Mailings➪
Envelopes and Labels” means that you should
click Tools, then Letters and Mailings, and then
Envelopes and Labels. D’oh!

When I want you to type something, I put the 
to-be-typed stuff in bold. For example: In the
Help Me Now or I’ll Suffocate text box, enter
Send oxygen pronto.

I set off Web addresses and e-mail IDs in mono-
space text. For example, my e-mail address is
talk2woody@woodyswatch.com (true), and my
newsletter Web page is at www.woodyswatch.com
(also true).

I always, absolutely, adamantly include the file-
name extension — those letters at the end of a
filename, like .doc or .vbs or .exe — when talk-
ing about a file. Yeah, I know that Windows hides
filename extensions unless you go in and change
it. That’s why you need to look at Technique 1.
Icons Used in This Book
While perusing this book, you’ll notice some icons in
the margins screaming for your attention. Each one
has a purpose.
When I’m jumping up and down on one foot
with an idea so absolutely cool that I can’t
stand it any more, I stick a Tip icon in the
margin. 
when printed. Use Excel as a database — er, list —
manager and read the why’s and wherefore’s of pivot
tables and charts. Finally, calculate sales tax with
the Lookup Wizard.
Part V: Pushing PowerPoint
Making presentations that don’t take forever. Still
with me? Don’t miss working with the right file type
and making a real presentation template. Eliminate
the middleman with presentations that run them-
selves. Plan for predictable questions and see how
working backward can save you lots of time. 
Part VI: Assimilating Access
A few quick programs go a long way. Discover how to
print cover sheets for all your reports as well as the
skinny on running totals and subtotals. Also read
how to print labels and then set formatting once . . .
and forget it.
Part VII: Combining the Applications
Some of the Office apps work together, some of the
time. Here you find my most-requested explanation:
how to print holiday greeting letters. Read on for
how to run an electronic newsletter. And don’t miss
converting a Word outline directly into a presenta-
tion or animating Excel charts in a presentation.
Cross-app finale: Rotate text in a Word document —
with a little help from Excel.
Part VIII: The Scary (Or Fun!) Stuff
Macros can make your life better. You need this stuff.
Become a power user by inserting unformatted text
in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Then make Word’s
Show All show you all that you want to see, with
none of that extra junk. Print a folder full of spread-
sheets. Strip personally identifiable information out
of Word docs and Excel spreadsheets. Become an
honorary member of Monty Python with spam bust-
ing. In conclusion, create smart documents.

Where to Go from Here

You don’t need to memorize the stuff marked
with this icon, but you should try to remember
that there’s something special lurking about.
Achtung! ¡Cuidado! Thar be tygers here! Any
place where you see a Warning icon, you can
be sure that I’ve been burnt — badly. Mind
your fingers. These are really, really mean
suckers.
When time is of the essence, this icon empha-
sizes the point. More than a Tip but not quite
a full Technique, this icon points out a quick
trick that can save you time — either now or
later.

Knocking Office
Into Shape


1
Making Windows
Safe for Office
E
very Office user needs to take security seriously. The cretins who
make programs that melt down the Internet, pummel sites with
bandwidth-clogging pings, or simply diddle with your data, are
constantly trolling for unwitting accomplices. Foil their plans by keep-
ing your wits about you.
Security is more than just an ounce of prevention. On rare occasion,
viruses can wipe out all your data, and worms can bring your e-mail
connection to its knees. Far more insidious, though, are the time-
sucking security problems that aren’t quite so obvious: the malware
that lurks and infects and destroys invisibly or intermittently.
Office rates as the number-one conduit for infections because it’s on vir-
tually every desktop. On most machines, Office amounts to a big, wide-
open target. Windows might get infected, but frequently the vector of
attack goes through an Office application.
No Office is an island: It’s tied into Windows at the shoulders and
ankles. To protect Office — and to protect yourself — you must start
by protecting Windows, by applying updates, getting Windows to
show you hidden information that can clobber you, and installing and
using antivirus software and a good firewall.
Updating Windows Manually
Did you hear the story about Microsoft’s Security Bulletin MS03-045?
Microsoft released the initial bulletin along with a patch for Windows on
October 15, 2003. Almost immediately, people started having problems
with the patch. A little over a week later, Microsoft issued a patch for the
patch. This new patch seemed to take care of most of the problems, but
then someone discovered that the program that installed the patch was
faulty. A month after the first patch came out, Microsoft issued a patch
for the patch to the patch.
Got that?

Technique 1: Making Windows Safe for Office
10
To tell Windows Update that you want to do it yourself
1.
Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Performance and
Maintenance➪System➪Automatic Updates.
In Windows 2000, choose Start➪Settings➪
Control Panel, and go from there.
Windows XP shows you the System Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-1.
• Figure 1-1: Windows Automatic Updates settings.
2.
Mark the Keep My Computer Up to Date
check box.
This allows Microsoft’s sniffer program to come
in and look at your copy of Windows. The sniffer
program sends an inventory of Windows pieces
and patches back to the Microsoft Mother Ship,
but as far as I (and several independent research-
ers) can tell, it doesn’t appear as if Microsoft
receives any information that can identify you
individually.
To protect Office, you need to keep Windows
updated. Indeed, some Windows patches — such as
the notorious Slammer/SQL patch MS02-020 — are
really Office patches disguised as Windows patches.
To protect Office, you have to protect Windows. And
to protect Windows, you have to protect Office.
Microsoft wants you to tell Windows to heal itself
automatically. I think that’s a big mistake — and cite
Microsoft’s track record as Exhibit A. It’s a sorry
state of affairs, but I believe that every Office user
should

Set Windows Update to automatically notify
you when new updates are available.

Tell Windows Update that you do not want to
download — much less install — new patches
automatically. If you need a patch, you can take
a few extra minutes and give the go-ahead.

Follow the major computer publications closely
to see whether new patches are stable and
effective before installing them.
Some industry observers would have you trust
Microsoft and set Windows Update to run auto-
matically. I say hogwash. In theory, a black-hat
cretin could unleash an Office-based worm that
will destroy your machine while a patch for that
very worm was sitting on Microsoft’s servers. In
practice, Microsoft doesn’t work fast enough to
release immediate patches. Demonstrably, your
risk from a bad patch is far greater than your risk
from a ground-zero worm attack. It doesn’t make
sense to trust your patching to the folks in Redmond.
I follow Microsoft’s patching follies extensively
in both Woody’s Office Watch and Woody’s
Windows Watch. They’re free electronic
newsletters that go out to more than half a
million subscribers every week. Sign up at
www.woodyswatch.com.
That said, you do need to make sure that you install
the patches — after they’ve been tried and tested by
a few million guinea pigs.

Showing Filename Extensions
11
3.
Select the first radio button under Settings
(Notify Me Before Downloading Any Updates
and Notify Me Again Before Installing Them
on My Computer).
That’s exactly what you want to do. Microsoft
might change the wording of this dialog box
slightly. (As this book went to press, there were
rumors that the next version of Windows Update
would encompass both Windows and Office.)
The intent, however, stays the same: You want
to be in control of what Microsoft puts on your
machine — and when.
4.
Click OK.
I talk about Windows Update, its implications, and
vulnerabilities in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies. Well worth reading to get the entire
Windows perspective.
Windows and Office are so inextricably inter-
woven that a security hole in one frequently
shows up as a security hole in the other. It’s
important to keep both Windows and Office
up to date, because Microsoft may have a vital
patch for an Office component, and not even
realize it, much less warn you about it!
Showing Filename Extensions
This is the most important Technique in the
entire book.
If you’re an old DOS fan (or even a young one),
you’ve been working with filename extensions since
the dawn of time. Microsoft shows them in all its
documentation — Help files, Knowledge Base articles,
and white papers. If you’re not familiar with exten-
sions (see the sidebar “Since When Did Filenames
Have Extensions?” for a definition), it’s probably
because Windows hides filename extensions from
you unless you specifically tell Windows otherwise.
These hidden extensions are supposed to make
Windows more user-friendly. Yeah. Right.
You probably know about EXE (executable) and
BAT (batch) files. Windows simply runs them when
they’re opened. You might not know about VBS
(VBScript) or COM files (command files; good old-
fashioned PC programs), which run automatically,
too. And I bet you didn’t have any idea that SCR
(screen saver) and CPL (Control Panel add-in) files
get run automatically, too.
The bad guys know. Trust me.
The creators of Windows decided long ago
that filename extensions should be hidden
from mortals like you and me. I think that’s
hooey. Every Office user should be able to see
her filename extensions. If you can’t see the
filename extensions either in Windows or in
Office, you stand a chance of getting zinged —
and spending lots of time fixing the damage.
Files attached to e-mail messages rate as the
number-one Trojan infection vector, and being
able to see filename extensions can make all the
difference. For example, that innocent file called
ILOVEYOU doesn’t look so innocent when it appears
as ILOVEYOU.VBS. You might be tricked into double-
clicking a file that’s called Funny Story.txt, but
you’d almost certainly hesitate before double-
clicking Funny Story.txt.exe.
If you’ve been looking around Office trying to
figure out how to force Office to show you
filename extensions in dialog boxes, you’ve
been looking in the wrong place! Windows
itself controls whether Office shows filename
extensions.
To make Windows show you the entire filename
1.
Choose Start➪My Computer.
2.
Choose Tools➪Folder Options➪View.
Windows shows you the Folder Options dialog
box, as shown in Figure 1-2.

Technique 1: Making Windows Safe For Office
12
Since When Did Filenames
Have Extensions?
For those of you who haven’t been around since ptero-
dactyls provided CPU cooling, a filename extension is just
the last bit of a filename — the part that follows the final
dot-whatever (like .doc) period in the name. So the file
called ILOVEYOU.VBS has a filename extension of VBS;
MELISSA.DOC has the extension .doc, and so on.
Office programs are all hooked up to their allotted filename
extensions. For example, files that end with .xls are
assumed to be Excel spreadsheets; double-click an XLS file
(or try to open one that’s attached to a message), and
Windows knows that it should run Excel, feeding Excel the
file. Same with DOC and Word, PPT and PowerPoint, MDB
and Access, and even the little-known PST and Outlook.
Using an Antivirus Product
These days, an antivirus package is an absolute
necessity — not only to protect your Office files and
programs but to protect Windows itself. Antivirus
software is cheap, reliable, easy to buy (you can 
get it online), frequently updated (sometimes with
e-mailed notifications), and the Web sites that the
major manufacturers support are stocked with
worthwhile information. I know people who swear
by — and swear at — all the major packages (see
Table 1-1).
Every Office user must

Buy, install, update, and religiously use one of
the major antivirus products. Doesn’t matter
which one.

Force Windows to show filename extensions.

Be extremely leery of any files with the file-
name extensions listed in Table 1-2. If you
download or receive a file with one of those
extensions (perhaps contained in a Zip file),
save it, update your antivirus package, and run
a full scan on the file — before you open it
• Figure 1-2: Windows hides its view options here.
3.
Clear the Hide Extensions for Known File Types
check box.
While you’re here, seriously consider selecting
the Show Hidden Files and Folders radio button
and also clearing the Hide Protected Operating
System Files (Recommended) check box. You
can find a detailed discussion of the implications
of both in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies.
4.
Click OK.
All the directions and screenshots in this book
(indeed, nearly all of Microsoft’s Help files,
Knowledge Base articles, and more) assume
that you’ve instructed Windows to show file-
name extensions.

Firewalling
13
The final filename extension is the one that
counts. If you double-click a file named Funny
Story.txt.exe, Windows treats it as an .exe
file and not a .txt file.
I cover many important details about antivirus soft-
ware, its care, and feeding in Windows XP Timesaving
Techniques For Dummies.

Firewalling
The Slammer worm demonstrated, loud and clear,
that Office users need to protect any PC that’s con-
nected directly to the Internet. Slammer slipped in
through a little-used port (Internet connection slot),
infected a particular type of Access database, and
then shot copies of itself out that same unprotected
port.
A firewall blocks your ports. It ensures that the traf-
fic coming into your PC from the Internet consists
entirely of data that you requested. A good firewall
will also monitor outbound traffic in order to catch
any bad programs that have installed themselves on
your machine and are trying to connect to other PCs
on the Internet.
Windows XP’s Internet Connection Firewall works —
and it’s a whole lot better than nothing. But it’s a big
target: If you were writing Internet-killing worms,
where would you direct your efforts? The upshot:
Enable Internet Connection Firewall (which is in the
process of being renamed Windows Firewall) by all
means, but to guard against all intrusions, you want
a third-party firewall as well.
Every Office user needs to ensure that a
firewall — some firewall, any firewall — sits
between his Office machine and the Internet. 
If you have a PC that’s connected directly to the
Internet, you can enable Windows XP’s Internet
Connection Firewall by following these steps:

4.
Click OK.
I have detailed instructions for setting up a firewall —
including, notably, the free version of ZoneAlarm —
in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques For Dummies.
Version notes: Internet Connection Firewall is
only available in Windows XP (unless you’re
running Windows 2003 Server — and if that’s
the case, you need all the help you can get).
1.
Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and
Internet Connections➪Network Connections.
Windows presents you with the Network
Connections dialog box.
If you’re using Windows 2000, you need to
choose Start➪Settings to get into the Control

Launching Office
Quickly
I
don’t know about you, but I use Outlook and Word about ten times
as often as all my other programs combined. And I hate going through
the click-click-click routine to start Word, in particular. If I try to choose
Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Word 2003 before
I’ve had my first latte in the morning, I’m more likely to run the Calculator
than Word. By the tenth time I’ve clicked all the way through, I’m ready
to eat my mouse.
Fortunately, Windows has a dynamite tray immediately to the right of
the Start button that’s called the Quick Launch toolbar. (You might not be
able to see it yet. If not, don’t worry because I show you how to bring it
to life in this Technique.) That piece of oh-so-exclusive Windows screen
real estate comes in mighty handy when you want to get a program —
most notably, Word — up and running quickly.
Take a few minutes now to get your Quick Launch toolbar set up prop-
erly. You’ll save at least that much time every day after it’s going. If you
follow along closely, you might discover a few rather obscure tricks
that’ll make Quick Launch a key part of your timesaving arsenal.
Empowering Quick Launch
Although the Quick Launch toolbar is the best place in the Windows uni-
verse to stick your Office applications, there’s a small chance that you
can’t see it. (Amazingly, Windows XP Professional version, right out of
the box, doesn’t show the Quick Launch toolbar — whereas Windows XP
Home does. Go figger.)
Version notes: Office 97 shipped with a program called the Office
Shortcut Bar, which many people still use. OSB had to be installed
manually in Office XP, and it disappeared entirely in Office 2003. The
Windows Quick Launch toolbar appeared in Internet Explorer 4, and I
recommend that you use it rather than the OSB, no matter which
version of Office you use. Quick Launch is much easier to configure,
and far more stable.
Technique
Save Time By
 Activating Windows’
Quick Launch toolbar
 Putting your most-used
Office programs on the
toolbar
 Changing the ToolTips so
they don’t get in the way

Technique 2: Launching Office Quickly
16
• Figure 2-2: A double chevron on the right indicates that
your Quick Launch icons won’t all fit.
To increase the size of the toolbar and get rid of the
double chevron
1.
Right-click any empty location on the Windows
taskbar.
2.
Clear the check mark next to Lock the Taskbar.
3.
Click the dotted pattern at the right edge of the
Quick Launch toolbar and drag it to the right.
That lengthens the area that Windows reserves
for the Quick Launch toolbar. Your hidden icons
appear as you make more room for them.
4.
When the Quick Launch toolbar is big enough,
right-click any empty location on the taskbar
and check the line marked Lock the Taskbar.
Many people prefer to make their taskbar
twice as tall as the default single layer. That
doubles the size of the Quick Launch area.
To do so, follow Steps 1 and 2 to unlock
the taskbar, click the line at the top of the
Windows taskbar and drag it up, and then
follow Step 4 to lock the taskbar again.
Putting Office Apps on the
Quick Launch Toolbar
You have several ways to put an icon for any Office
application on your Quick Launch toolbar. This is
the fastest, easiest way I know — but you have to
follow the instructions carefully:
1.
Make sure that the Quick Launch toolbar is
visible.
See the preceding section.
2.
Choose Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft Office;
then right-click the Office application that you
want to put on the Quick Launch toolbar.
Look immediately to the right of your Start button.
Do you see a handful of icons there (as shown in
Figure 2-1)? If so, the Quick Launch toolbar is alive
and well on your PC. If not:
• Figure 2-1: The Quick Launch toolbar sits immediately to
the right of the Windows XP Start button.
1.
Right-click any open area on the Windows
taskbar, down at the bottom of your screen.
2.
Select Toolbars and mark Quick Launch.
Windows XP brings up the Quick Launch toolbar,
as shown in Figure 2-1.
At the very least you should see icons for Internet
Explorer, Outlook, your desktop (a handy button if a
program freezes your machine or if you want to see
the desktop without minimizing every window), and
Windows Media Player. If you’re unlucky, your Quick
Launch toolbar will be crammed with junk from the
manufacturer of your PC as well as every two-bit
program you’ve ever installed.
Quick Launch real estate should be guarded
jealously. Only put your most-often-used pro-
grams on the toolbar. If you see any icons on
your Quick Launch toolbar that you don’t
want, right-click them and then choose Delete.
That doesn’t get rid of the program, but it
does free up room in a key location on your
taskbar.
You might see a double chevron (>>) on the right
edge of your Quick Launch toolbar (see Figure 2-2).
If you do, so many icons are on the toolbar that
Windows can’t display them all in the space allotted.

Putting Office Apps on the Quick Launch Toolbar
17
In Figure 2-3, I right-clicked Microsoft Office
Word 2003.
• Figure 2-3: Add an app to the Quick Launch toolbar from
here.
It’s important that you right-click the Office
application. If you left-click, you might drag
the entry off your Start menu, and it’s a monu-
mental pain to put it back.
3.
Drag the Office application down to the Quick
Launch toolbar.
A thick, black vertical line appears on the toolbar
(see Figure 2-4).
• Figure 2-4: The thick, black line indicates where Windows
will drop your application.
4.
Release the mouse button and choose Copy
Here.
Don’t choose Move Here. If you do, you’ll have
to put the Office application back on the Start
menu. (See the sidebar, “What If the Wheels
Fall Off?”)
Windows responds by placing an icon for the
Office app on the Quick Launch toolbar. If you
hover your mouse over the icon, you’ll see a fab-
ulously long, distracting description of what the
application might or might not be able to do (see
Figure 2-5). I tell you how to, uh, tone down the
rhetoric in the section “Changing Quick Launch
Names,” later in this Technique.
• Figure 2-5: You’re permitted to snicker at Microsoft’s
overblown descriptions.
If you play around with the new icon, you’ll discover
that it works just like all the other icons on the Quick
Launch toolbar. You can click it and drag it to a differ-
ent location on the toolbar. You can even click and
drag it off the toolbar, onto your desktop. You can
right-click and copy, cut, or delete it. But most of all,
if you click it once, Windows starts the application.
What If the Wheels Fall Off?
What do you do if you accidentally remove one of the
Office applications from your Start menu? It happens more
often than you think, and the cure isn’t too bad — if you
know the trick.
First, you must find the program associated with the miss-
ing application. Choose Start➪My Computer and in the
Windows Explorer window that appears, navigate to C:\
Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11. Look
for one of the programs listed in the following table:
Application
Program Name
Access
msaccess.exe
Excel
excel.exe
FrontPage
frontpg.exe
InfoPath
infopath.exe
OneNote
onenote.exe
Outlook
outlook.exe
Picture Manager
ois.exe
(continued)

Technique 2: Launching Office Quickly
18
Although Office 2003 programs are found
in the \OFFICE11 folder, Office XP programs
are in a similar folder called \OFFICE10, and
Office 2000 programs are in one called \Office.
The rest of the procedures apply to any ver-
sion of Office, although the structure of the
Start menu is quite different in Office XP and
earlier.
The Windows Quick Launch toolbar isn’t
limited to programs. In fact, you can put
commonly used documents on the toolbar,
spreadsheets, presentations — whatever strikes
your fancy. Simply navigate to the document
you like (either in Windows Explorer or in one
of Office’s Open or Save As dialog boxes),
right-click the document, and drag it down to
the Quick Launch toolbar. Release the button
and then choose Create Shortcut Here.
Changing Quick Launch Names
Talk about intrusive verbiage! The ToolTips that
Microsoft puts on its Office applications read like
novels. (A ToolTip is the info box that pops up when
you hover your mouse over an icon.) When I’m scan-
ning Quick Launch icons, the last thing I need is to
wade through an in-yer-face ToolTip such as the one
in Figure 2-5, or “Excel / Perform calculations, ana-
lyze information, and manage lists in spreadsheets
or Web pages by using Microsoft Excel.” As my Silicon
Valley Girl diction coach would intone, gag me with a
RAM chip.
Fortunately, it’s easy to change the ToolTip. Unfortu-
nately, it isn’t quite as simple as you might think: If
you right-click (most) Quick Launch icons, choose
Rename, and then give the icon a new name, that
name appears as the ToolTip. Unfortunately, Office
applications aren’t so well-behaved. Here’s how to
change the names and protect the innocent (which
is to say, us):
1.
Right-click the icon in the Quick Launch tool-
bar whose ToolTip you want to eviscerate . . .
er, change.
Application
Program Name
PowerPoint
powerpnt.exe
Publisher
mspub.exe
Word
winword.exe
After you find the program, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the program and choose Send To➪
Desktop (Create Shortcut).
2.
Click X in the upper-right corner of Windows
Explorer and then go back to your desktop.
3.
Right-click the newly created icon and
choose Cut.
That puts a shortcut to the Office application on the
Windows Clipboard.
4.
Right-click the Start button and choose Explore
All Users.
5.
In the window that appears, navigate to the
Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office folder.
6.
Right-click the right side (see the following fig-
ure) and choose Paste.
That puts a shortcut to the Office application on the Start➪
All Programs➪Microsoft Office menu for anyone who uses
the PC. You probably want to change the name that appears
on the menu. (Shortcut to MSACCESS is a bit, uh, obtuse.)
I discuss how to change the name in the next section.

Changing Start Menu Names
19
2.
Choose Properties.
Windows shows you the Properties dialog box
for that particular Quick Launch icon.
3.
Click the General tab.
You have to start on the General tab because
that’s where the first line of the ToolTip
originates.
4.
In the text box at the top of the General tab,
change the wording to a better (shorter/
more descriptive) ToolTip.
In Figure 2-6, I changed Microsoft Office Word
2003 to read simply Word 2003.
5.
Click the Shortcut tab (see Figure 2-7).
6.
Delete the garbage in the Comment box.
7.
Click OK.
• Figure 2-6: Make the ToolTip read something short and
sensible.
• Figure 2-7: All the text in the Comment box gets
shoveled onto the ToolTip.
Now hover your mouse over the icon in the Quick
Launch toolbar. Compare Figure 2-8 with Figure 2-5.
Much easier and faster to use, wouldn’t you say?
• Figure 2-8: The lean, no-nonsense face of an optimized
Word Quick Launch ToolTip.
Changing Start Menu Names
I don’t know why Microsoft insists on using such
high-falutin’ names on my Start menu. You might be
more prescient than me, but it takes my eyes forever
to bypass the marketing junk and cut to the heart
of the matter. Staring at a Start menu like the one
in Figure 2-3 gives me the shivers. I see the name
“Microsoft Office” 12 times before I get down to the
application I need.

Technique 2: Launching Office Quickly
20
• Figure 2-9: The Start Menu structure that compares to
the menu items you see in Figure 2-3.
• Figure 2-10: The new Start menu consisting of names you
choose.
You know, the programmers at Microsoft laugh
at all this pretense. It slows you down and
serves no purpose but to pay homage to the
Redmond Marketing Miracle. Save your eyes
and maybe a little time by cutting out the junk.
Fortunately, taking control of all the distracting ver-
biage is easy. Here’s how:
1.
Right-click the Start button and choose Explore
All Users.
Windows Explorer appears, located at the
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\
Start Menu folder (see Figure 2-9).
2.
On the left, double-click Programs.
Windows Explorer shows you folders for the
high-level items that appear on the Start➪
All Programs menu. Compare the folder list
here with your Start menu, and you see how
the folder names and menu names correspond
directly.
3.
Right-click the Microsoft Office folder, choose
Rename, and type a better (shorter and/or
more descriptive) name.
You might want to make it MS Office 2003, but
you can choose anything you like.
4.
Double-click your newly renamed Office folder.
Windows Explorer shows you a list of shortcuts
to all your Office programs.
5.
One by one, right-click each program, choose
Rename, and type in a better (shorter and/or
more descriptive) name.
6.
Click X in the upper-right corner of Windows
Explorer.
7.
Choose Start➪All Programs and take a look at
all your new, shorter, more descriptive Office
entries (compare Figure 2-10 to Figure 2-3).
I find it much easier and faster to crank up the
Office programs when I don’t have to wade
through Microsoft Office 12 times.

Organizing My
Documents
for Speed
I
can’t count the number of hours that I’ve lost looking for documents
that weren’t sitting where they should be.
Office gives you many ways to search for documents — complex, sophis-
ticated, needle-in-the-haystack methods that work remarkably well. But
the best way to find a document quickly is to look for it in the most obvi-
ous place. In order to do that, of course, you must have a most obvious
place.
No two people organize things the same way. Your closet doesn’t look
like my closet (thank heaven); your desk doesn’t look like my desk (if you
can find your desk). But there are a few tricks to organizing yourself —
and your computer — that seem to work for most people.
At the heart of it: a place for everything, and everything in its place. Your
mom was right. I bet she even told ya so.
Understanding Your Requirements
Robert Heinlein invented the perfect term for this technique: to grok. In
order to grok the way you use documents, you need to understand not
only the content of the documents themselves, but you also have to under-
stand their context — that is, the way they fit into the larger scheme of
things. In order to get your documents organized in a way that they’ll
stay organized, you have to grok your requirements.
Most people start by putting everything in My Documents. After a week or
a month, My Documents has a few dozen (or a few hundred) documents,
so they put a new folder under My Documents, move half the docs over
to the new folder, and start flipping a coin every time they save a new
doc, trying to decide which folder it goes into.
Technique
Save Time By
 Thinking through the
ways you use documents
 Setting up My Documents
to reflect the way you
work
 Saving documents to the
right folder — the first
time
 A place for every thing,
and every thing in its
place

Technique 3: Organizing My Documents for Speed
22
• Figure 3-1: A rough sketch of the kinds of things I work
with every day.
• Figure 3-2: Fleshing out the major groups.
Weeks turn into months turn into years, and the
folders start growing like thistles. Pretty soon, you
have folders in one part of My Documents that really
should be in another part of My Documents, except
they really don’t fit there, either, and wouldn’t it be
easier to put two copies of this document in those
folders, and. . . . You get the idea.
You’ll save an enormous amount of time, day
after day, if you come up with a framework for
storing your data in ways that make it easy to
decide where to save your documents and to
find where a specific kind of document was
saved.
Here’s how I suggest you go about thinking through
your requirements:
1.
Forget about computers.
People stumble all over themselves trying to
second-guess folder structures and network
topologies. Fuhgeddaboutit. For the moment.
2.
Think about what you need to organize.
Are you mostly concerned about reports?
Memos? Products? Courses? Customers?
3.
Take a pen and sketch out the major groups.
Yes, a real pen. Or use OneNote (see Figure 3-1).
(Although OneNote is billed as a member of the
Office 2003 System, most people have to pay
extra for it.)
4.
Within each group, sketch out what subgroups
might be involved.
For example, in my Books group, I include my
recent books. I should also include my older
books, but I don’t refer to those very often, so
they should probably go at an even lower level
(see Figure 3-2).
5.
Group and regroup until you get a manageable
mess.
For example, if you have 100 clients, each of
whom requires many documents, consider
grouping the clients by type.

Translating Requirements to Reality
23
6.
Start thinking about computers again.
When you have an eagle’s eye view of your data
needs, it’s time to start shoehorning all that into
a structure for My Documents.
There’s a natural tendency to put all your
spreadsheets in one place, all your presenta-
tions in another, and all your Word documents
in yet another place. Try to avoid prejudging
documents based on the application in which
you created them. The documents and the
Visio drawings that you send to Dr. Jones for
her practice should be in the same folder (or
group of folders) as the Word documents that
you send to her. You’ll find it much easier and
more efficient to organize documents based
on their content — not their appearance.
7.
Don’t forget the oddball requirements.
Everybody needs a folder for taxes. Most people
need folders for family, or the house, or the Boy
Scout Troop. Think, think, think.
Translating Requirements
to Reality
In the preceding section, I talk about figuring out
your requirements. In this section, I show you how to
translate those requirements into reality. My goal: to
make it easy, fast, and a no-brainer to drill down to
the correct location for every document that you
create as well as every document that you need to
retrieve. If it takes you more than a minute to find a
document, you’re better off using Office’s Search
window.
With your requirements written down from the pre-
vious section
1.
Mark the folders that have to be shared, either
with other people on your computer or with
other computers on your network.
Those folders should all go into Shared
Documents. Some folks think that’s tantamount
to being banished to Siberia. Don’t worry. It’s
one-click easy to get into Shared Documents
from all the Office dialog boxes when you use
the tricks that I discuss in Technique 4.
If you’ve identified documents or groups of doc-
uments that require ongoing collaboration —
that is, if many people are going to be work-
ing together to get them whipped into shape —
you’re a candidate for a SharePoint portal.
Setting up a portal isn’t easy, but after the
beast is in place, it’s relatively simple to
work with the documents inside. See www.
microsoft.com/sharepoint/index.asp
for details.
2.
Mark any folders that have to be kept private.
If you have folders that absolutely must be kept
private — even from other people using your
computer — and you aren’t connected to a Big
Corporate Network with protection already
in place, you need to look into Windows XP’s
Simplified File Sharing or Windows 2000/2003’s
Share capabilities.
You can find an extensive discussion of
Windows XP file sharing and its limitations
in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies.
Don’t tell Windows XP to mark any folders as
Private until you completely understand the
consequences of doing so. The Windows XP
documentation is abysmal. If you lose your
password, you might never be able to get the
data back. Look twice before you leap!
If you have sensitive files, consider password
protecting the individual files (or zipped fold-
ers of files) instead of using the Windows
method of protection. (To password-protect a
file in any of the Office 2003 applications,
choose File➪Save As, click the Tools drop-
down menu, and choose Security Options.)
Office’s password routines work surprisingly
well, although they can be cracked.

Technique 3: Organizing My Documents for Speed
24
4.
When you’ve finished fleshing out My
Documents, select Shared Documents on
the left (under Other Places) and continue
adding folders to Shared Documents.
Of course, you can click, drag, or right-click and
rename any existing file or folder to get it whipped
into this new scheme of things.
Never, ever keep two copies of a document. If
you do, your life will be forever more compli-
cated than is necessary. If you bump into a
document — or even a folder — that should
go into two places at once, stick it in the most
likely location and then create a shortcut to
the document (or folder) in the second loca-
tion. To do so, right-click the original docu-
ment (or folder) and choose Copy. Navigate
to the secondary location, right-click on a
blank spot, and choose Paste Shortcut.
The preceding tip applies emphatically for
files and folders on networks! If you have a
file or folder that needs to be shared among
many machines, stick one copy in the Shared
Documents folder of the most likely PC and
then put shortcuts to the file or folder on all
the other machines.
Need a quick, dirty, easy way to pass text, pic-
tures, Web addresses, and miscellaneous vitu-
perations among users and machines on a
network? Because Microsoft doesn’t have a
Clipboard that lets you copy something on
one machine and then paste it on another, I
always set up my networks with one special
Word document called Network Clipboard.
doc. I stick that file in the Shared Documents
folder of the PC that has the Internet connec-
tion. Then I go to each PC and put a shortcut to
that file on the desktop of every user on the PC. 
3.
Choose Start➪My Documents and start fleshing
out the folder structure that you wrote down.
No doubt you already know that you can add
new folders by right-clicking an existing folder
and choosing New➪Folder.
My initial folder structure appears in Figure 3-3.
• Figure 3-3: The folder structure that I use every day.
If you have more than 20 or so folders inside a
folder, you have too many. It’ll take too long to
look through them while you’re drilling down.
Try to group and consolidate them. It’s much
faster to click through one extra level and only
look at a few folders than it is to scan a bunch
of folders all at once.

Drilling Down with
the My Places Bar
T
his Technique rates as a big payoff. By investing just a few minutes
now, you can reap dividends every time that you open or save a
new file. And unlike similar promises that litter your junk mail, this
one is for real.
All the Office applications use the same dialog box when you choose
File➪Open or when you click the Open icon on the Standard toolbar. All
the Office applications also use the same dialog box when you choose
File➪Save As or when you save a file for the first time. On the left side of
those dialog boxes sits a timesaving aid of the first degree: the My Places
bar, which you use to drill down to a specific location with just one click.
Although the My Places bar rates as one of the top timesaving spots in
all of Officedom, the method for customizing it will tie you in loops. You
could spend a lifetime trying to second-guess how the bar really works.
That’s where this Technique comes in. Here, I explain how to customize
your My Places bar, as shown in Figure 4-1, so that you can jump right
to the places you use most often whenever you open or save a file.
• Figure 4-1: This Technique explains how to create a customized My Places bar like
this one, which includes a custom icon for the Shared Documents folder.

• Figure 4-2: The My Places bar that Office sets up for you.
Adding Locations to 
the My Places Bar
You can start putting the My Places bar to work for
you by adding the locations that you use most often,
which is easy to do.
Checking Out the Default
My Places Bar
The My Places bar (refer to Figure 4-1) appears on
the left side of the Open and Save As dialog boxes
in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, InfoPath, Access,
FrontPage, OneNote, Publisher, and Visio. Outlook
uses a similar, but subtly different, My Places bar.
You might bump into discussions about the My
Places bar in Windows itself. That’s a completely
different My Places bar: The Office developers
didn’t use the Windows dialog boxes, and mak-
ing changes to the Windows My Places bar
won’t make any difference at all to the Office
My Places bar.
Straight out of the box, Office 2003 has five icons in
the My Places bar, as shown in Figure 4-2. As Table
4-1 explains, these aren’t always the places that
will get you in and out of your maze of folders 
lickety-split.

Showing More Icons on the My Places Bar
27
Don’t forget that the main reason for customiz-
ing the My Places bar is to speed up the way
you use Office. If you have to leaf through too
many icons, you’ll get bogged down in the
minutiae. Keep the list short, sweet, and
simple — and don’t be afraid to drop an
icon the minute it stops pulling its weight.
1.
Bring up the My Places bar by, for example,
starting Word and choosing File➪Open.
You see the Open dialog box (refer to Figure 4-2).
2.
Navigate to the folder that you want to put on
the My Places bar.
Use any method to get there: the drop-down 
list at the top of the Open dialog box, click the
up-one-level button or the Back button, or even
create a new folder.
3.
Select the folder that you want to add to the My
Places bar by clicking it. Then in the upper
right of the dialog box, choose Tools➪Add to
My Places.
I almost always put new documents in my com-
puter’s Shared Documents folder so that other
people working on my computer — or attached
to my network — can get at them easily. In Figure
4-3, I click the My Computer icon on the left, click
the Shared Documents folder once, and then
choose Tools➪Add to My Places.
• Figure 4-3: Adding a folder to the My Places bar
is enormously convoluted.
Office responds by adding an icon to the My
Places bar for the folder that you selected (see
Figure 4-4).
• Figure 4-4: The new My Places bar entry appears at the
bottom of the list.
4.
Click either the Open or the Cancel button (bot-
tom right), and all the Office applications will
show the folder that you chose on the My
Places bar.
You might need to click the down arrow at the bot-
tom of My Places bar to see your new icon. And mak-
ing more room for those icons is the subject of the
next section.
Showing More Icons on 
the My Places Bar
As soon as you start adding icons to the My Places
bar, you’ll soon feel claustrophobic. With all those
icons bellying up to the bar, you can soon fill up the
space allotted and thus can’t see all your icons at
once. And having to click the up and down arrows
kind of defeats the purpose of having shortcuts in
the first place. (You can see one of these up arrows
above the Desktop icon in Figure 4-4.)

2.
Right-click the icon that you want to move, and
then choose either Move Up or Move Down
from the context menu that appears.
3.
Click either the Open or the Cancel button, and
all the Office applications will show this new
sequence of icons on the My Places bar.
It’s odd that Microsoft hasn’t implemented a simple
click-and-drag interface for the My Places bar, simi-
lar to, oh, the interface on the Start menu or the
Quick Launch toolbar. Do you suppose the ’Softies
ran out of money?
Removing Icons You Added
Removing icons that you’ve placed on the My Places
bar is also very easy.
1.
Bring up the My Places bar by, for example,
starting Word and choosing File➪Open.
You see the Open dialog box (refer to Figure 4-1).
2.
Right-click the icon that you want to delete and
then choose Remove.
3.
Click either the Open or the Cancel button, and
the icon will be removed from the My Places
bar in all the Office applications.
Hiding Built-In Icons 
Although removing your custom icons from the My
Places bar is like falling off a log (see preceding sec-
tion), hiding the $#@! built-in icons — My Recent
Documents, Desktop, My Documents, My Computer,
and My Network Places — requires a painful, time-
consuming trip to the Registry. Yep. No doubt about
it. Microsoft ran out of money when it was working
on the My Places bar user interface.
To give any of the built-in icons the heave-ho
(personally, I ditch the My Recent Documents
and My Computer icons), you should start by
Fortunately, it’s very easy to tell Office that you want
it to show about twice as many icons — albeit
smaller icons — on the My Places bar:
1.
Bring up the My Places bar by, for example,
starting Word and choosing File➪Open.
You see the Open dialog box (refer to Figure 4-1).
2.
Right-click anywhere on the My Places bar and
choose Small Icons.
The My Places bar shows you twice as many
icons — roughly ten at a time, instead of five (see
Figure 4-5).
• Figure 4-5: My Places holds about five large or ten small
icons.
3.
Click either the Open or the Cancel button (bot-
tom right), and all the Office applications will
show small icons on the My Places bar.
Moving Icons on the 
My Places Bar
Of course, you should put your most frequently used
icons at the top of the list. To do so:

Bring up the My Places bar by, for example,
starting Word and choosing File➪Open.
You see the Open dialog box.

saving a backup copy of the existing Registry
entries (in case you ever change your mind)
before you remove any icons. Otherwise, you
screw things up so badly that you want to get
back to how things were. I explain how to
save a backup later in this section.
Standard Registry precautions apply. Follow
the instructions here. You can look at anything
you like, but don’t change anything except
what you originally went in to change.
Although it’s extremely rare that an accidental change
in the Registry will mess up anything significant —
no matter how many scary warnings you see — you
always face a teensy-tiny chance that if you change
something, you’ll break Windows. So don’t change
anything, except the entries that I talk about here,
okay?
Backing up your My Places settings
First make a backup of your Registry settings for
your My Places bar:
1.
Choose Start➪Run.
Windows cranks up the Run dialog box (as
shown in Figure 4-6).
• Figure 4-6: This way to the Windows Registry.
2.
Type regedit and then press Enter.
Welcome to the Registry Editor (as shown in
Figure 4-7).
• Figure 4-7: Although it isn’t as scary as you think, you
would be well advised not to change things
willy-nilly inside the Registry.
3.
Click the + signs until you navigate down to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\
Office\11.0\Common\Open Find\Places.
4.
Right-click the Places folder ( key) and then
choose Export.
That’s called exporting the Places key in Registry
parlance (see Figure 4-8). The Registry Editor not
only exports the key you’ve chosen, but it also
automatically exports every key underneath the
one you’ve chosen. In this example, if you export
the Places key, you also automatically export the
StandardPlaces and UserDefinedPlaces keys.
• Figure 4-8: Export the Places key so you can bring it back
if things go sour.

to fiddle with any settings other than the ones I men-
tion here. But you know that already.
To take specific built-in icons off the My Places bar:
1.
In the Registry Editor, double-click the Places
key (see Figure 4-10), and then click the
Registry entry for the icon you want to zap.
See “Backing up your My Places settings” earlier
in this Technique to find out how to open the
Registry Editor.

sponds to what icon.

The Registry Editor responds by showing you the
Export Registry File dialog box (see Figure 4-9).
• Figure 4-9: A Registry backup file ends with the filename
extension .reg.
5.
Give the backup file a good name and choose a
location where you can find it. Then click Save.
In Figure 4-9, I call the file My Places bar 
original.reg, and I put it on my desktop.
At this point, you have a full backup of all the
Registry settings for your My Places bar. If anything
goes bump in the night, find that file and double-
click it. Your Registry will be magically restored to
its original condition.
Tweaking My Places in the Registry
Only after you make a backup should you go in and
make changes to the Registry. And I advise you not

on the right-hand side), double-click Show to
open the Edit DWORD dialog box, and then go
to Step 4.
3.
If the icon you want to get rid of has an associ-
ated key that does not have a value called
Show, do the following:
a. Choose Edit➪New➪DWORD Value. Regedit
creates a new value called, disingenuously,
New Value #1.
b. Type Show. (In the process, you’re overtyp-
ing New Value #1.)
c. Press Enter twice. The Edit DWORD Value
dialog box appears.
In Figure 4-11, the MyComputer key — which is
associated with a folder that I want to take off
the My Places bar — does not have a value
called Show. So I choose Edit➪New➪DWORD
Value. Then I immediately type Show (overtyping
Regedit’s automatically generated New Value #1),
creating a new value called Show. Finally, I press
Enter twice.
• Figure 4-11: The MyComputer key doesn’t have a value
called Show.
4.
In the Edit DWORD Value dialog box (see
Figure 4-12), type the numeral 0 (zero) in the
Value Data box and then click OK.
• Figure 4-12: The Show value should be set to 0 (zero).
At this point, each icon you want to delete
should have a value called Show, which has been
set to zero (see Figure 4-13). The data
0x00000000 (0) is, as you probably guessed, just
plain zero.
• Figure 4-13: The MyComputer key now has a Show value
that’s set to zero.
5.
Choose File➪Exit to leave the Registry Editor.
You can’t delete all the built-in icons on the
My Places bar. If you try, Office will put the
Desktop icon on the bar.
Test your settings by starting one of the Office appli-
cations. Choose File➪Open. The offensive icon(s)
should be banished from the My Places bar (see
Figure 4-14).

Technique 4: Drilling Down with the My Places Bar

• Figure 4-14: My lean, quick My Places bar.
Version notes: The My Places bar debuted in
Office 2000, but there were no tools provided.
You couldn’t even switch between small icons
and large icons. Office XP improved the situa-
tion substantially but still left out a number of
bells and whistles, and XP wouldn’t let you put
some specific folders on the bar. If you’re using
Office 2000 or XP and want the full feature
set — and much more — take a look at the
$14.95 WOPR (Woody’s Office POWER Pack)
Places Bar Customizer, from www.wopr.com.
Yes, that Woody is this Woody.
Taking Control of Icons That Won’t Move
Up and Down
Sometimes adding Show values as described in the preceding
procedure will interfere with your ability to move icons up and
down on the My Places bar. You know that the navigation has
gone awry when you right-click an icon, and the Move Up and
Move Down options are grayed out. (Another stellar example
of the user interface that Microsoft didn’t bother to improve.)
If you find that your Move Up and Move Down options are
gone, you can assign locations on the My Places bar manually:
1.
Follow the preceding steps to create a new
DWORD value called Index for each icon on
the My Places bar.
Find Registry entries for any icons that you’ve
manually assigned to the My Places bar in the
UserDefinedPlaces key (refer to Figure 4-13).
2.
Set the value of Index to 1 for the icon that you
want to appear at the top of the My Places bar.
3.
Similarly, set the value of Index to 2 for the
icon that you want to appear second, 3 for
third, and so on.

Backing Up
Quickly and
Effectively
I
n this life, only three things are certain: death, taxes, and hard drive
crashes. Yes, you need to back up your Office files. In fact, chances are
good that a large percentage of the really, really important data that
sits on your computer exists in Office files. You’re no, uh, dummy. You
know you need to back up.
If you’re connected to a Big Corporate Network, there’s a fair-to-middling
chance that all your files are backed up for you already. Check with your
network administrator. But if you aren’t on a Big Corporate Network,
you’re on your own; Office doesn’t back itself up.
Most Office users — particularly those with a lot riding on their Office
data — would do well to consider buying a third-party backup program.
In this Technique, you find out what to look for in a program, what your
backup options are (and which ones will save you time), and how to cre-
ate and schedule backups by using ZipBackup, a $30 package that runs
rings around Windows’ own.
If your hard drive ever breaks down . . . no, strike that . . . when your hard
drive breaks down, you’ll save hours, days, and weeks of abject fear if
you have a good backup at hand.
Been there. Done that.
Backing Up: Why Pay More?
If your backup needs are modest and you don’t particularly want to
shell out any more cash, Windows XP Backup will do. You can bring 
up Windows Backup by choosing Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪
System Tools➪Backup. I talk about Windows XP Backup extensively in
Windows XP Timesaving Techniques For Dummies.
On the other hand, if you have a lot riding on your Office files and you
don’t mind spending about $30, you can get a more versatile, easier-to-
use backup that’s sure to save your data and your time in the long run.
But more on that later in this Technique.

Technique 5: Backing Up Quickly and Effectively
34
If you use a backup program that produces
normal files, such as .zip files (instead of
arcane files meant for backing up to tape),
bringing back an old copy of a file can be very
quick and easy indeed.

Runs unattended with a minimum of hassle

Doesn’t give you the willies
Personally, I use a little program called
ZipBackup, which I explain how to use later
in this Technique.
If you want to back up your entire hard drive, as I
explain in the next section, look for a program like
Norton Ghost (www.symantec.com) that will chomp
through all the bits to create a complete copy of the
hard drive in one step.
Choosing Which Files to Back Up
Here are the two extremes in the backup spectrum.

Some folks believe that you should back up every-
thing — that is, take a full snapshot of your hard
drive — so you can restore the whole shootin’
match in case your drive goes up in smoke.

Others believe that you should select only the
important folders for backup, letting the rest
hang out to dry. After all, you have a copy of
Windows and Office and all your applications on
installation CDs already, so why waste the (con-
siderable) space to keep a backup copy?
I used to side with the damn-the-torpedoes-back-it-
all-up camp, but I’m starting to believe in a middle
way. A backup of your entire hard drive can make it
difficult to restore pieces of what you’ve backed up.
Locating and bringing back that two-week-old copy
of Financial Statement 2003.xls can take forever.
What’s wrong with Windows XP’s Backup?

Windows XP Backup makes you jump through all
sorts of hoops to back up to multiple CDs. If your
backups are less than 650MB in total, hey, no
problem. But if you have an Outlook PST file like
my Outlook PST file — along with a zillion graph-
ics files and oodles of big spreadsheets —
Windows XP Backup will only back them up into
one big, monolithic file — too big to fit on a CD.

Windows XP Backup creates backups in a weird,
old-fashioned, tape-friendly format. The only way
to pull data from a Windows XP backup is to use
Windows XP Backup. And if you can’t get Windows
XP Backup to work right (for whatever reason),
you’re completely out of luck.

Setting up Windows XP backup for unattended
backups — such as ones that run in the middle
of the night — takes a master’s degree in com-
puter science. See Windows XP Timesaving
Techniques For Dummies for all the gory details.

I might be hopelessly hip, and pardon me while I
clean my yttrium shades on my NPL Super Black
leather cape, Neo, but that tape-like Windows XP
Backup interface just gives me the willies.

uitous Zip format

Choosing Which Files to Back Up
35
If you’re concerned about saving time, backing up
everything might not be the best approach.
As a timesaving alternative to the full backup,
I suggest performing a surgical backup that
saves copies of only your Office files and set-
tings (see “Saving your settings” later in this
Technique). This minimalist approach makes a
lot of sense if you’re short on backup storage
space or if you screw up a file and want to
revert to the version you had last week. Of
course, you want to take a snapshot of your
entire hard drive occasionally, in case some-
thing disastrous happens. But for workaday
backups, stick to the important stuff.
Finding your Office files
If you decide to back up only your Office files, make
sure that you pick up all the file types listed in Table
5-1 when you create your backup. See “Running
ZipBackup” later in this Technique for an example
of how to create a backup.
Read Table 5-1 closely to see that almost all
the important Office files are stored in \My
Documents, possibly \Shared Documents,
and in the \Documents and Settings folder
associated with your user name. That’s what I
back up.

through the paces with ZipBackup to give you an
idea of how to set up and run a backup program
that’s more adaptable and more attuned to the typi-
cal Office user than Windows XP’s backup.
ZipBackup normally costs $39.95, but Office
2003 Timesaving Techniques For Dummies
readers can buy it for just $29.95 by going to

can download the trial version of ZipBackup

To create a backup using the ZipBackup Wizard
1.
Choose Start➪All Programs➪ZipBackup➪
ZipBackup.
The ZipBackup Wizard appears.
2.
Mark the Backup Files to a Zip File radio button
and then click Next.
The wizard asks you to choose what kinds of
files you want to back up (see Figure 5-2).
• Figure 5-2: Select what you want to back up.
3.
Choose the general category of backup that you
want to perform and click Next.
Don’t worry if you don’t see exactly what you
want. In Figure 5-2, I choose to back up my files
and settings.
4.
The wizard gives you an opportunity to add or
remove folders from the ones that it chooses
Saving your settings
When you back up your data, you should also back
up your settings. If something goes wrong, it can take
longer to get your settings reestablished than it can
to retype a letter or two or twenty.
Office’s Save My Settings Wizard (Start➪
All Programs➪Microsoft Office ➪Microsoft Office
Tools➪Microsoft Office 2003 Save My Settings
Wizard) saves most (but not all) of your Office set-
tings in an OPS file in the \My Documents folder (see
Figure 5-1). I recommend periodically running the
Save My Settings Wizard before you do a backup cre-
ating a new OPS file so that you can back it up with
the rest of your Office data.
• Figure 5-1: Run the Office Save My Settings Wizard
every month or so to create a file that
contains your Office settings. 
Running ZipBackup
Dozens and dozens of backup programs are on the
market, ranging from decent routines written by
weekend programmers to monster systems scaled
back for the individual user.
I use ZipBackup because it has all the characteristics
I describe earlier in this technique. Your mileage
may vary, of course, but I wanted to take you

Running ZipBackup
37
(see Figure 5-3). If you want to change
ZipBackup’s selected folders, mark or clear the
check boxes on the list and then click Next.
• Figure 5-3: Add or remove folders from the wizard’s
recommended list.
As I explain earlier in “Choosing Which Files to
Back Up,” you can back up all your files or back
up just your Office files for easier retrieval. If you
back up only Office files, refer to Table 5-1 for a
handy list of files to select.
In Figure 5-3, I added the \Shared Documents
folder because that’s where I commonly put doc-
uments that need to be backed up.
5.
ZipBackup presents you with a choice of which
folders to include in the backup (see Figure
5-4). See Table 5-2 and click the appropriate
button; then click Next.
ZipBackup asks what kind of backup you want to
make. This is a fairly standard list, and no matter
what backup package you use, you’ll likely have
similar (if not identical) choices. Table 5-2 details
the choices and their implications; if you have
space, choose Normal.
6.
Choose a filename and location, using the
check boxes to append the current date and
time, if you like. Then click the Backup button
(see Figure 5-5).
• Figure 5-4: Choose a backup type.
• Figure 5-5: Pick the backup location and filename.
I recommend including the current date in the
filename, if only to avoid overwriting older
backups.
ZipBackup displays its progress as it performs
the backup, which can take a great deal of time if
you’ve selected many files. While the backup is
under way, your machine will run like molasses,
so this is a good time to download that copy of
War and Peace or go get a latte.
7.
When ZipBackup finishes, the “tah-dah” win-
dow at the end gives you an option to view a
summary report. Click View and verify that the
backup finished properly. (See the Completed
line in Figure 5-6.)

problem.) When you’re happy with the results,
click the Close button.
8.
When ZipBackup asks whether you want to
save your Backup Job, click Yes.
9.
In the Save As dialog box that appears, choose
a convenient location and click Save.
It’s important to save the job if you want to set
ZipBackup to run unattended, which I explain
how to do later in this Technique.
Regular workaday backups can go on the
same hard drive as the original files, which
makes it easier to retrieve an old version of a
file that you accidentally clobber. But from
time to time, you should also make copies of
all your important data and store that backup
on a different drive. In fact, for real disaster
recovery, you should store those complete
backups in a different building.
10.
Click Close twice to return to Windows. You’re
done.
• Figure 5-6: ZipBackup gives you full details on how the
backup completed.
The ZipBackup summary report usually says that
several system files couldn’t be backed up. As
long as the files involved are clearly system files,
you’re okay. (If some other files weren’t backed
up, try opening them to see whether there’s a

Scheduling ZipBackup
39
Scheduling ZipBackup
ZipBackup’s reliance on standard, old, everyday Zip
files, as well as its ability to split files across multiple
CDs, are admirable. But its ability to run unattended,
while you sleep, will really save you time.
To schedule regular backups
1.
Follow the steps in the preceding section to run
a backup and save the settings in a ZB file.
2.
Choose Start➪All Programs➪ZipBackup➪
ZipBackup.
The ZipBackup Wizard appears.

On the lower left, click the ZipBackup Explorer
button.
ZipBackup goes into its more-advanced Explorer
mode.
4.
Choose File➪Open and open the ZB file that
you created in the preceding section, “Running
ZipBackup.”
ZipBackup Explorer shows you all the settings
for that particular backup job (see Figure 5-7).
• Figure 5-7: Bring back the specific backup job that you
want to run periodically.
5.
Verify that you have the correct folders
selected in the upper-left pane.
6.
Choose Tools➪Schedule Backup Jobs.
ZipBackup shows you the Schedule Backup Jobs
dialog box (as shown in Figure 5-8), with your
current job highlighted.
• Figure 5-8: Heed the warning at the bottom of this dialog
box!
7.
Click the Schedule button, and in the Scheduled
Task dialog box that appears, click the Schedule
tab (see Figure 5-9).
8.
Choose a schedule that you like — backups run
best when you aren’t anywhere near your PC —
and click OK.
Windows XP’s scheduler asks you for a password
(see Figure 5-10).
9.
Type in your Windows password and then
click OK.
The password that you type in this step must
match the password on your account at the
time the scheduled backup is run. If you ever
change your Windows password, you need to
go back into the scheduler and change the
password here as well.

Click OK on the Schedule tab and then choose
File➪Exit to get out of ZipBackup.
Providing that your password matches, the
backup will run at the time you specify.
After the first scheduled run, check to make
sure your backup ran correctly. Follow Steps 1
through 6 above and verify the Last Run Time
entry in the Schedule Backup Jobs dialog box.

Keeping Office 
Up-to-Date
W
ithin two weeks of its official launch date, Microsoft released
three major patches to Office 2003. Right out of the starting
gate, Office 2003 appears to be the most frequently patched
Office version in Microsoft history.
If you run Exchange Server — even a little Exchange Server on a Windows
Small Business Server network — and you rely on the automatic Office
updater to keep your machine patched, you missed two of the three
Office 2003 patches: Outlook 2003 breaks Exchange Server, you have to
patch Exchange Server separately (two times!), and those patches aren’t
available — indeed, aren’t even mentioned — on the Office update site.
All the Office and Windows components have become so thoroughly
intertwined (see Technique 1) that keeping on top of Office and Windows
updates makes me feel like Rex Harrison officiating at a pushmi-pullyu
Celebrity Death Match.
This Technique shows you when you can trust the automatic Office
updater . . . and what to do when you can’t. (Although Office 2003 is my
prime concern, this Technique also includes specific, hard-to-find details
for installing the latest fixes to Office 97, Office 2000, and Office XP.) You
can save a lot of time and worry by patching Office, the right way, the
first time.
Patching Jargon: A Rose by Any Other Name
You can tell a lot about a profession by looking at its jargon — the words
that insiders use to convey large amounts of information in a staccato
conversation. The chaos surrounding Office (and Windows) patching
gets reflected in the jargon of the patchers.
I use the term patch to mean a piece of software that alters another piece
of software. Patches are supposed to fix problems. I say that in a non-
judgmental way. Honest.

Technique 6: Keeping Office Up-to-Date
42
Microsoft has been, uh, economizing on
Security Bulletin numbers lately — releasing
multiple security patches with a single bulletin
number — probably as PR damage control.
Mainstream press accounts frequently refer to
the number of Security Bulletins that Microsoft
has released as an indication of Windows and
Office’s unreliability. Don’t be suckered. One
Security Bulletin can contain multiple unre-
lated patches.
The system of bulletins and patches is unnec-
essarily complex because Microsoft makes
it exceedingly difficult to correlate Security
Bulletins (MS04-xxx numbers) with patches
(which rely on Knowledge Base articles, such
as 831527), which in turn are completely unre-
lated to Office version numbers (such as
11.5604.5703), which (do you see a pattern
here?) might or might not have anything to
do with individual files’ version numbers. See
the upcoming section, “Identifying Versions to
Get Help,” for further commiseration.
Microsoft would have you believe that
there’s a difference between Critical,
Important, and Moderate Security Bulletins
(www.microsoft.com/technet/security/
bulleting/rating.asp). Horsefeathers. In
theory, Critical patches fix holes that can be
exploited by some cretin without you doing
a thing, and Important patches fix holes that
require you to do something spectacularly
dumb — click a file or answer Yes in a dialog
box — to get zapped. But in practice, the
labels are entirely arbitrary and change from
day to day, in spite of all the fancy doubles-
peak. Don’t waste time worrying about it.

An Update is a patch that isn’t particularly critical
and doesn’t relate to security. (If the patch were
security–related, it’d trigger a Security Bulletin,
right? Well, no. The world of Office patches is
littered with inconsistencies. See KB articles
822036 and 824938 for examples of Office secu-
rity updates that don’t have Security Bulletins.)
Updates are also associated with Knowledge
Base articles and are generally referred to by
their KB article number.
The Microsoft Knowledge Base — Quickly
All Microsoft security communication with the vast,
unwashed masses goes through the Knowledge Base,
which is Microsoft’s giant collection of accumulated wisdom
about all its products (only a small part of which is visible
to the public, starting at http://support.microsoft.
com). Patches are numbered, and those numbers refer to
Knowledge Base (KB) articles. If you work with security
patches, you use the Knowledge Base extensively.
If you find yourself bobbing in and out of the Knowledge
Base frequently, you can set up Internet Explorer so that it
goes directly to a specific KB article when so bidden: Type
kb 831527 in Internet Explorer’s Address box, for exam-
ple, and IE hops directly to Knowledge Base article 831527.
I give full details in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies.
Microsoft boasts an entire lexicon of terms revolving
around patches and patching. Although the terms
have official definitions (see Knowledge Base article
824684), they’re more often honored in the breach
than in the practice. Here’s my best take on the real
meaning of the terms that you’ll hear most often:

A Security Bulletin is a sequentially numbered
advisory (such as MS03-050; see Figure 6-1) that
Microsoft releases to alert customers to security-
related patches. Every Security Bulletin has one
or more related Knowledge Base articles that, in
turn, refer to the software patch(es) covered by
the Security Bulletin.
• Figure 6-1: Security Bulletin MS03-050, which refers to
Knowledge Base article 831527.

Finding (And Using) Office Update
43

A Critical Update is a patch that keeps Office
from crashing, destroying data, or otherwise
clobbering your valuable work (see Figure 6-2).
Microsoft draws a distinction between a Critical
Update and a hotfix, but I don’t see any difference.
• Figure 6-2: Office 2003’s first Critical Update.

Service Releases are bunches of patches (and
patches of patches to patches) that get released
at once to make it easier to fix everything that’s
gone wrong before. From time to time, Service
Releases include minor new features. Supposedly
there’s a difference between Service Releases,
Service Packs, and Update Rollups, but it all
sounds like marketing hogwash to me.
Outlook 2003 has a built-in spam filter (see
Technique30) that requires constant updating.
As this book went to press, it became apparent
that Microsoft would release occasional (per-
haps sporadic is a better term) updates to the
spam filter, via the normal Office 2003 Update
mechanism.
Finding (And Using)
Office Update
Microsoft used to make it easy to find and use the
Office Update site (http://officeupdate.com). Now
you have to click through a page or two of commer-
cials and “Ain’t Office wunnerful” self-congratulatory
drivel before you can get to the real content.
This is progress.
Worse, the most important Office updates —
including Critical Updates — might not even
be directly accessible from the Office Update
site.
If you have only one copy of Office 2003 to keep
tamed, the fastest and easiest way to make sure that
you’re up-to-date is to rely on automatic update.
Unfortunately, automatic update has some severe
shortcomings, but as long as you’re wary — and you
only have one PC — the update approach works rea-
sonably well:
1.
Start your favorite Office 2003 application.
For detailed advice on Office 97, 2000, and XP,
see the version-specific sections at the end of
this Technique.
2.
Choose Help➪Check for Updates.
Office launches Internet Explorer and takes you
to the Office Downloads site (as shown in Figure
6-3). See all those ads? Microsoft is trying to sell
you many things — and take some sting out of
the fact that you’re here to fix a hole in Office.
3.
Click the Check for Updates button.
The Office Update automatic detection program
kicks in, displaying a progress bar.
4.
Follow the instructions onscreen to download
and install any outstanding updates.
Note: You might need your original Office 2003
CD, so have it handy.

Technique 6: Keeping Office Up-to-Date
44
right — an Office XP update on an Office 2003
PC, for example — or if it stops working entirely,
download and install the patch directly, as I
describe in the next section.

If you have more than one copy of Office to
update, you have to download the entire patch
file for each one. That’s why Microsoft makes
the patches available for download, as I describe
in the next section.
Applying Patches Manually
If you have more than one PC running Office, it
makes absolutely no sense to use the automatic
updater, downloading those humongous patch files
over and over again for each PC. Microsoft makes
client version patches available for download, so
you can clog up your Internet connection just once
and then apply the patch on each PC, one by one.
(Client version is Microsoft-speak for a patch that’s
applied to regular, old, everyday computers —
clients as opposed to servers.)
The easiest way for Office 2003 users to find and
download client version patches is
1.
Go to www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2003/
admin/default.htm.
Microsoft posts a list of all available patches to
Office 2003 (see Figure 6-4).
• Figure 6-4: The hard-to-find list of all patches to
Office 2003.
• Figure 6-3: The Office Downloads site, formerly known as
the Office Update site.
Here are (at least) four problems with this one-size-
fits-all approach to updating Office 2003:

You won’t find all the pertinent patches. Many
Office problems manifest themselves as prob-
lems in other pieces of software (for example,
the two Exchange Server patches that I discuss
at the beginning of this Technique). You need
to be ruthless in your pursuit of all patches —
Windows and Office — to fix those ugly security
holes.

Office might install patches that you don’t
want. It’s considered heresy, but the fact is that
some patches do more harm than good. You
should wait a day or two or three — maybe even
a week or two — before installing a new patch,
and see how much wailing and gnashing of teeth
surrounds the release.
I follow all new patches very closely (and with
a jaundiced eye) at Woody’s Windows Watch,
my free, weekly electronic newsletter. Visit
www.woodyswatch.com to subscribe.

If the updater gets screwed up, you might see
wacky results. The program that detects and
installs updates might go bonkers. If the updater
offers to install patches that just don’t look

45
Do not click the link to the update on this
page. If you do, you’ll end up downloading
an administrative update — a (typically huge)
full-file version of the patch that you neither
need nor want.
2.
Jot down the KB article number(s) of the
patch(es) that you need.
For example, in Figure 6-4, the first critical
update to Office 2003 is listed as KB article
number 828041.
3.
Bring up the Knowledge Base article associated
with the patch.
In this case, it would be http://support.
microsoft.com/?kbid=828041; refer to Fig-
ure 6-2.
4.
Choose Edit➪Find (On This Page) and search
for the phrase client version.
Almost always, you end up at the download link
for the downloadable version of the patch (see
Figure 6-5).
• Figure 6-5: The downloadable version of the patch is the
client version.
5.
Download the patch and follow the instructions
in the Knowledge Base to install it.
The precise method for installing each patch
varies a little bit, so make sure you take a few
seconds to RTFM . . . ahem, read the tips from
Microsoft.
You might find it easier to run Office Update
on one machine, jot down the KB article num-
bers based on that run (see Figure 6-6), and
then use Steps 3–5 of the preceding to down-
load and install the individual patch files on all
your PCs. Assuming the updater is correctly
identifying missing patches, anyway. That way,
you’ll download the updates twice, but the
second download produces a file (a client
patch) that you can simply transfer from
machine to machine.
• Figure 6-6: You can use the Office updater to retrieve
a list of KB articles and then manually
download and apply the patches.
Identifying Versions to Get Help
It should be very easy for you to tell which version
of Office you’re running. I don’t mean, oh, Office 2003
versus Office 2000. That’s easy. I mean you should
start Word or Outlook, choose Help➪About, and be
able to tell immediately which patches have been
installed as well as which version of the program
you’re using. You can’t — and I’ve been railing about
this for years.
When you ask someone for help — more often than
not, Microsoft tech support — you have to be able
to provide the person who’s helping you with spe-
cific information about the version you’re using.
Many times when you go diving through Microsoft’s

Technique 6: Keeping Office Up-to-Date
46
(For a list of the application program names, see
Technique 2.)

The third number is the version of mso.dll that
you’re using. mso.dll is something of an uber-
Office program, which is more or less the glue
that holds Office together.
The version numbers listed in the About dialog
box corresponds to what you will see if you go
into Windows Explorer, right-click the file, choose
Properties➪Version, and look at the File Version
number. In this example, if you right-click powerpnt.
exe, choose Properties➪Version, and look at the
Product Version number, you see 11.0.5529. If you
right-click mso.dll and choose Properties, the
Product version number comes up 11.0.5703 (see
Figure 6-8). Combine both of those version numbers
and you end up with 11.5529.5703, the number in
the Help➪About dialog box.
• Figure 6-8: The About dialog box contains the version
number of mso.dll.
Knowledge Base, trying to figure out what’s wrong
with Office and how to cure it, you have to know
exactly which version you’re running. Sometimes
other manufacturers (especially antivirus compa-
nies) have problems with specific versions of Office,
and you have to know what you’re running before
you can fix their problems. At this stage in Office’s
evolution, that means you have to use three sepa-
rate tools: Office Help, Windows Explorer, and
Microsoft’s online revision sniffer.
When you start the program that’s giving you
fits and choose Help➪About (for example, Help➪
About Microsoft Office PowerPoint), the About
dialog box (see Figure 6-7) reads something like
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 (11.5529.5703).
Here’s what the numbers mean:
• Figure 6-7: PowerPoint 2003’s About screen.

The first numeral, 11, denotes Office 11 — what
you and I know as Office 2003. If you see a 10, it’s
Office XP; a 9 represents Office 2000. Office 97’s
Help doesn’t use this numbering system.

The second number is the version number of the
specific Office application program that’s run-
ning. In this example, 5529 means that you’re
running version 5529 of the file powerpnt.exe.

Updating Office 97
47
Keeping the version numbers straight is very
important because certain combinations of
Office program versions and mso.dll versions
can cause untold grief. If you ever find multi-
ple copies of the Office programs or mso.dll
on your PC and want to know which copies
are actually running, check their version num-
bers in Windows Explorer against the version
reported in the Help➪About dialog box.
Frequently, Knowledge Base articles will tell
you which versions should or should not be
running.
Unfortunately, not all patches to Office change the
specific version numbers reported in the About
dialog box. To get a complete list of revisions made
to the version of Office 2003 on your computer,
go to the Web site http://office.microsoft.com/
officeupdate/alreadyinstalled.aspx, and wait for
the updater to scan your system. You should be
rewarded with a list such as the one in Figure 6-9.
• Figure 6-9: The only way to retrieve a full list of installed
updates is by trusting the Office updater — 
a dicey proposition at best.
Updating Office 97
Running Office 97 on Windows 98 (or Me) is like
building a house of cards on top of a jackhammer.
Still, tens of millions of people slog through that
combination every day, and they deserve to get
the best that Microsoft has to offer.
Microsoft likes to pretend that it doesn’t support
Office 97 any more, but it does. Both the November 11,
2003 security patches for Word 97 and Excel 97 and
the October 16, 2002 security patch for Word 97
amply demonstrate Microsoft’s continuing support
for its legions of Office 97 customers.
Or maybe it demonstrates fear of the legions of prod-
uct liability lawyers. Never mind.
In spite of what you might read on (many!)
Microsoft Web pages, the automatic Office
updater doesn’t work with Office 97. You have
to perform all the Office 97 updates manually.
To make sure you have the latest Office 97 patches
1.
Start Word and choose Help➪About. If you do
not see Microsoft Word 97 SR-2 listed, go to
http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/
9798/sr2off97detail.aspx and install Office 97
Service Release 2b.
Note that you might need to install Service
Release 1 first. Check that Web page for details.
2.
Go to http://support.microsoft.com/
?kbid=830354 and download and install the
Word 97 November 11, 2003 patch.
This patch includes the MS02-059 October 16,
2002 patch (which was previously available only
if you begged somebody at Microsoft to point
you to it), the MS02-031 June 19, 2002 patch, and
all previous patches.
3.
Go to http://support.microsoft.com/
?kbid=830356 and download and install the
Excel 97 November 11, 2003 patch.
Similarly, this patch includes all previous Excel
patches.
4.
PowerPoint 97 has been patched since SR-2,
but you have to contact Microsoft and ask to
have the patch made available to you.

Updating Office XP
Office XP Service Pack 2 has been patched
extensively — in fact, Service Pack 3 might
have been released by the time you read this.
Here’s how to bring Office XP up to speed:
1.
Start Word and choose Help➪About.
If you do not see Microsoft Word 2002
(10.xxxx.xxxx) SP-2, go to http://support.
microsoft.com/?kbid=325671 and follow the
instructions there to install Service Pack 2.
The xxxx version numbers aren’t important, but
the SP-2 is. If you don’t see SP-2, install Service
Pack 2.
If Microsoft has released an Office XP Service
Pack 3, it should be noted on that Knowledge
Base article. It should also be listed at http://
support.microsoft.com/default.
aspx?scid=fh;en-us;
offxpset&product=ofxp.
2.
Run the automatic updater at http://office.
microsoft.com/officeupdate to see whether
you need any more patches, and then install
as necessary.
If you haven’t updated them recently, you’ll need
the Word 2002 November 11, 2003 and Excel 2002
November 11, 2003 patches.

ATTOPT utility, at www.slovaktech.com/

for details).
Outlook 2002, like Office 2000 SP-3, hides certain
files attached to e-mail messages.
If you’re still using Outlook 97, you’re a better man
than I: It drove me nuts. Microsoft distributed free
copies of the Outlook 98 upgrade for more than a
year. You could download it for free from http://
microsoft.com until June, 1999 — around the time
Office 2000 appeared. Since then, the only way to get
the Outlook 98 upgrade is to buy a book (probably
used) with Outlook 98 on the companion CD.
Updating Office 2000
I still think Office 2000 (now at Service Pack 3) rep-
resents the sweet spot of the Office suite. It’s stable
and capable — and it doesn’t include all the onerous
product activation hassles.
Here’s how to bring your Office 2000 system up to
date:
1.
Start Word and choose Help➪About. If you
do not see Microsoft(r) Word 2000 (9.0.xxxx
SP-3), go to http://support.microsoft.
com/?kbid=326585 and follow the instruc-
tions there to install Service Pack 3.
The key here is the SP-3 tag; the xxxx version
number isn’t important. If you don’t see SP-3,
install Service Pack 3.
2.
Run the automatic updater at http://office.
microsoft.com/officeupdate to see whether
you need any more patches, and then install
as necessary.
Chances are good that at the very least, you’ll
need the Word 2000 November 11, 2003 and
Excel 2000 November 11, 2003 patches.
3.
Download and install Ken Slovak’s
ATTOPT utility, at www.slovaktech.com/
attachmentoptions.htm, which I explain
how to do in Technique 32.
Outlook 2000 with SP-3 installed hides certain
files attached to e-mail messages, and this utility
enables you to take back control of attachments.
The utility is free, but Ken asks for a $10 donation.

Disabling
Automatic
Hyperlinks
T
his is the number-one question I hear from Office users, all over
the world, time and time and time again: How do I keep Office from
screwing things up when I type a Web address or an e-mail address?
I hear the question so often that I decided to devote an entire Technique
to the topic.
As you might imagine, several epithets typically get thrown into the mix —
and for good reason. Automatic hyperlinks is one of the most intensely
stupid settings in all of Officedom.
If you take a minute or two right now to turn off the ^%$#@! auto-
matic hyperlinks, you’ll save untold misery in the future. And it’s not
just your misery I’m talkin’ about. Your readers hate it, too, even if
they’re too polite to mention it. Guaranteed.
Understanding IntelliNONsense
Once upon a time, somebody in Redmond decided it would be, like, really
cool to have Office applications watch while you’re typing things, and
occasionally swoop in and make what you typed, you know, like better,
cooler, and all that stuff, right?
I mean, if you type a Web address like www.dummies.com, you really
want it to be blue and underlined, don’t you? And you want it to be hot,
too, so if anybody accidentally clicks it (Ctrl+clicks it in Office XP or 2003),
you want them to be sent out to Office Never-Never Land and make them
wait for a minute or two or more while Office launches Internet Explorer
and IE tries to bring up the www.dummies.com Web page, yeah?
Microsoft calls it IntelliSense. I call it IntelliNONsense.
Unless you go in and change things, Word, Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint
all automatically modify typed Web addresses and e-mail address into
underlined, blue links.

Hyperlinks are always subject to this kind of hijacking; it’s
not a deficiency in Office, by any means. But if you’re
inured to the danger because “Office always does that,”
you might be surprised some day when a suitably modified
Web beacon (see Technique 29) finds its way into your
Inbox or onto your desktop.
Turning Off Automatic
Hyperlinks
All the Office 2003 applications allow you to take
back control of your typed Web addresses and 
e-mail addresses, although details vary.
In Word 2003:
1.
Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect Options and click
the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
Word has the most intrusive, er, extensive array
of automatic formatting capabilities (see 
Figure 7-1).
• Figure 7-1: Take back control from Word’s
IntelliNONsense.
I wish I had a nickel for each time I’ve seen an under-
lined Web address or e-mail address in a major publi-
cation. It’s one thing for National Geographic to alter
the location of one of the pyramids at Giza, to goose
things up electronically. It’s another thing entirely to
see an underlined Web address in print because the
editors couldn’t figure out how to turn the damnable
thing off.
Want to get rid of the link, swiftly and easily?
If you catch the transmogrification quickly
enough while you’re typing, click the Smart
Tag that seems to appear immediately when-
ever Office does something dumb, and choose
Undo Hyperlink. If the Smart Tag isn’t around
any more, right-click the link and choose
Remove Hyperlink.
Hijacking a Link
Automatic links aren’t just intrusive. If you come to accept
them as just another annoying aspect of using Office, they
can come back to bite you. Why? The link is more than skin
deep.
If I type www.woodyswatch.com with automatic hyper-
links enabled, the address is converted into a link to the
Web site www.woodyswatch.com. Innocent enough.
The thing is, these links can easily be hijacked and send you
to site that’s a bit, uh, unsavory, instead. All anyone has to
do is right-click the automatically generated link and choose
Edit Hyperlink. In the Edit Hyperlink dialog box that appears
(see the following figure), someone can type a different
Web address, and in the Text To Display box, retype the
original Web address, hiding the actual address from the
unsuspecting reader. (Note: If you Ctrl+click the link, you
can see where it actually leads.)

Digging with
Research —
Quickly
O
ffice 2003 brought us all sorts of pains, not the least of which is
the Research task pane. The Research pane hooks into Word,
Outlook (when you’re using Word to view or write a message,
which is the default), Excel, and PowerPoint, and at times it hangs on
the left edge of Internet Explorer.
Office 2003’s Research pane includes some very powerful tools, including
a fully functional version of Microsoft Encarta, which is the same good-but-
not-excellent Microsoft encyclopedia that’s available free online (www.
encarta.com). (You might have paid big bucks for Encarta a few years 
ago — D’oh!) Add the 20-minute-delayed stock quotes and historic price
charts, and you have the formula for time saving and time wasting on a
massive scale.
The Research pane also includes a bunch of advertising fluff, designed
specifically to convince you to part with your money — in exchange for
information that’s readily available on the Internet.
As long as you have a reasonably fast Internet connection, using the
Research pane is considerably simpler — and possibly faster — than
pulling out your old dictionary or encyclopedia and running the lookup
manually. The results won’t be as thorough as a trip through Google,
say, but if you’re looking for quick, adequate definitions and explana-
tions, the Research pane is a decent place to start.
Fixing the Research Pane
Right out of the box, the Research pane is a great advertising tool, fully
functional and ready to convince you to spend more money. Before I try
to explain how to use the Research pane and its options quickly and effi-
ciently, I strongly urge you to cut out the commercials:

to search for anyway. See “Looking in the
Dictionary,” later in this Technique.

Unless you have an ongoing need to be teased
by the first hundred words of a million maga-
zine articles, clear the eLibrary check box.
eLibrary will tell you that it found your Research
task pane search item, show you the first few
words of each magazine article, and then offer
to show you the full articles for a price. This is
not worth your time nor your money unless
you really need access to the magazines that
eLibrary represents exclusively (see www.
elibrary.com). Use http://news.google.com
instead.

6.
Seriously consider clearing the MSN Search
check box.
This is a personal preference, I suppose, but
why have the Research pane spend time banging
against MSN’s search engine when, with a couple
of clicks and the Google toolbar, you can run
against Google’s mother lode. (Read more about
the Google toolbar in Windows XP Timesaving
Techniques For Dummies.)

Standard toolbar (see Figure 8-1).
Word brings up the Research task pane.

2.
Click Research Options at the bottom of the
Research task pane.
Office shows you the Research Options dialog
box (as shown in Figure 8-2). The remainder of
this procedure helps you decide which Research
Options you need as well as which will only get
in your way.
• Figure 8-2: This dialog box controls which references the
Research pane searches.

If you want Office to suggest translations
for individual, common words, keep the

don’t normally use machine translation (or
if you’re content to work with something like

check box.

Looking in the Dictionary
55
Finding Synonyms
Nine times out of ten, when you’re using Word,
Outlook, or PowerPoint, you won’t need or want to
use the Research task pane to look for a synonym.
Simply right-click the word, choose Synonyms, and
choose from one of the six most-common synonyms
(or one antonym) on offer. 
Right-clicking a word to find a synonym is
quick and easy. The Research task pane is slow
and cumbersome. Why? Because the synonym
entries in the right-click menu are all stored on
your computer: You can look up a synonym
even if you aren’t connected to the Internet.
To save time, don’t right-click and choose
Look Up. Right-clicking and then choosing
Synonyms➪Thesaurus feeds the chosen word
directly into Office’s Thesaurus, which is
already located on your PC. If you choose
Look Up, the word you choose goes into the
Encarta Dictionary, which is a Web site away.
If you can’t get the synonym you want with a simple
right-click, choose Thesaurus, and Office brings up
the Research task pane (see Figure 8-3). (Note: Excel
doesn’t offer synonyms in its right-click contextual
menu. You have no choice but to use the consider-
ably slower Research task pane — or start Word,
type the word, right-click it, and go from there.)
Here’s how you drill down in the Thesaurus — 
which is to say, to find a synonym of a synonym. In
the Research pane, click the word that you want to
explore. As long as you continue to search in the
Thesaurus, Office’s response remains snappy.
When you find the synonym you want, click the
down-arrow to the right of the word in the Research
pane and choose Insert. Your old word is automati-
cally replaced by the new one.
• Figure 8-3: The Research task pane searches for
synonyms.
Looking in the Dictionary
Although the Office Thesaurus is swift, the other
reference book you’re likely to use — the Encarta
Dictionary — can be sluggish indeed.
Sometimes a quick look at a word’s synonyms
will confirm immediately whether you have
the right word — and avoid a trip to the dic-
tionary. For example, if you aren’t quite sure
whether the word hirsute means hairy, right-
click hirsute and choose Synonyms.

Technique 8: Digging with Research — Quickly
56
Using the Encarta Encyclopedia
In the preceding section, I explain why a search of
the dictionary might not produce the results that
you expect. You might not realize that the reason
why the Research task pane frequently responds to
your inquiries with a blank stare is because Office
doesn’t think of the encyclopedia as a reference
book.
Go figger.
The example in the preceding section left the
Research task pane high and dry, without a match
on the word thailand. Here’s how to get an answer:
1.
Start Word. Inside a Word document, type
thailand. Right-click thailand and choose
Look Up (or hold down the Alt key and then
left-click thailand).
If your last search was a dictionary search — 
in Microsoft-speak, All Reference Books — you
see the “blank stare” Research task pane.
2.
Click the down arrow on the box underneath
the Search For box and then choose All
Research Sites or Encarta Encyclopedia.
After more churning and spluttering (which
could be slightly less annoying if you’re using
the world’s fastest Internet connection), the
Research task pane produces worthwhile results
(see Figure 8-4).
3.
Click one of the links in the Research pane.
Internet Explorer opens with the Research pane
on the left, the appropriate Encarta Web site on
the right, and lots and lots (and lots and lots) of
advertising (see Figure 8-5).
The primary timesaving trick to using the Encarta
Dictionary lies in understanding that the dictionary
doesn’t include many of the terms that you might
expect to find in a dictionary. For example, the
names of almost all countries, states, cities, rivers,
mountains, people, and zillions of additional proper
nouns aren’t in the dictionary at all. If you look for
them in the dictionary, you’re just wasting your time.
For example, if I right-click the word thailand and
choose Look Up (or hold down the Alt key and click
the word — same thing), the Research pane opens,
grabs the word thailand, looks it up, sits there for a
while — and finds nothing.
If you didn’t disable the Translate search
service, as I mention in the first section of this
Technique, chances are good the Research task
pane will get hung up trying to translate the
word thailand into French or Spanish! Oy.
The problem? Actually, there are two:

Office’s Research task pane is hard-wired to
repeat the same search that it last performed.
When you right-click a word and choose Look 
Up — or hold down the Alt key and left-click a
word — the Research pane repeats its previous
search by using the new word. If your previous
search was a dictionary lookup, you go out to
the dictionary again.

There’s no way to tell the Research task pane
that you want it to look in both the dictionary
and the encyclopedia. You get one or the other
but not both.
Compounding the problem is the blasted termi-
nology: Only Microsoft would have the hubris to
draw a distinction between Reference Books (which
includes the Thesaurus located on your PC and
Microsoft’s dictionary out on the Web) as opposed
to Research Sites (which includes Microsoft’s ency-
clopedia Web site), and prevent you from searching
both simultaneously.

Searching for Business
57
• Figure 8-4: At last, on the second try, you strike pay dirt.
• Figure 8-5: Clicking through a Research pane
encyclopedia hit will take you to the
corresponding Encarta Web site.
It only takes a few more seconds to copy the
word to the Clipboard, point Internet Explorer
to Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), paste the
word into the Wiki search box, and press Enter.
Try it a few times and see whether Wikipedia
doesn’t give you better results. Best of all,
you can freely use the material that you copy
from Wikipedia as long as you acknowledge
the source. See wikipedia.org/wiki/
wikipedia:copyrights for details.
Don’t forget Google! If you really want to research a
topic, as opposed to looking it up in an encyclopedia,
head to www.google.com.
Searching for Business
The Research task pane’s All Business and Financial
Sites offering, found in the drop-down list under
Search For, hooks into the Gale Company database
of business information as well as MSN stock quotes
in several countries.
Although the All Business and Financial Sites option
makes for great demos, you need to keep three
things in mind to keep from spinning your wheels:

You can look up a company’s data in the Gale
Company database (see Figure 8-6) by using its
name or its stock symbol.

The MSN 20-minute delayed stock quote must be
fed the company’s ticker symbol (if you type the
company name, you come up with nothing).

The basic Gale Company information can be
quite helpful (see Figure 8-6), but if you want
more-detailed info, you have to pay for it.
If you don’t know a company’s stock symbol,
the Gale database will have it. Just search on
the company name.

Technique 8: Digging with Research — Quickly
58
Although you can open only one Research task
pane at a time in Excel or PowerPoint, Word lets you
work with a different Research pane for each open
document. Thus, if you want to have two or more
Research panes going at the same time, create a new
document (or two or three) in Word, and have at it
(see Figure 8-7).
• Figure 8-7: To use multiple Research panes, create
multiple Word documents.
Here is an easy way to see two (or more)
Word documents simultaneously, with the
panes accessible: Choose Window➪
Compare Side by Side.
• Figure 8-6: The Gale Company database understands
Starbucks.
In some circumstances, the Research pane can
be so useful that you really want two panes open.
I frequently open two panes to trace down differ-
ent branches of a synonym search simultaneously.
Hopping around encyclopedia entries can be much
faster with two panes open, also.

Copying and
Pasting in a Nonce
A
good friend once asked me, “I want to copy paragraphs from dif-
ferent parts of a document and put them in a new document. It’s
easy if all the paragraphs are next to each other — I just highlight
them, choose Edit➪Copy (or press Ctrl+C), move to the new document,
and choose Edit➪Paste (or press Ctrl+V). Can Microsoft build something
into Word that makes it easy to do the same thing with paragraphs that
aren’t next to each other?”
Ah, do I have a Clipboard for you!
The Office 2003 Clipboard — it’s really a pane — doesn’t solve all the
copying and pasting problems most people encounter, but it can save you
a lot of time if you can put up with its idiosyncrasies. My friend was disap-
pointed by the fact that it’s still fastest and smartest to gather and paste
pieces one at a time, rather than trying to set up a massive paste, all at
once. But he was delighted to find that he can stick all the copied pieces
in one place and work with them en masse. The Office Clipboard makes it
easy to gather far-flung pieces of text and pictures. Unlike earlier versions
of Office, this 2003 flavor of the Clipboard is also easy to turn off.
If you copy and paste and copy and paste, spending a few minutes
now taking control of the Clipboard (or getting a decent replacement
for the Clipboard, as I describe in this Technique) can save you time
day after day.
Working with the Office Clipboard 
versus the Windows Clipboard
If you’ve used Windows or Office for any time at all, you’ve undoubtedly
worked the Windows Clipboard every which way but loose: Select stuff,
copy it or cut it, click where you want it to go, and then paste. Easy. The
Windows Clipboard consists of a single cubbyhole. You stick stuff in the
cubbyhole and bring it out when you need it.

Technique 9: Copying and Pasting in a Nonce
60
Word has an old feature called the Spike that
used to be used to gather text and pictures
from many different places and put them all
in one place in a document. Don’t use it. The
Office Clipboard is vastly superior, in no small
part because you can actually see what you’re
doing.
If you clear the Office Clipboard (by clicking the
Clear All button), the Windows Clipboard gets
zapped out, too.
Although it’s true that Word lets you select
noncontiguous pieces of text and pictures
(that is, pieces of text that aren’t physically
next to each other), I don’t recommend that
you select noncontiguous pieces of text if
you’re going to move or copy. It’s much
faster and less error-prone to use the Office
Clipboard to gather the text, block by block,
and then move or copy it where you will.
The contents of the Office Clipboard hang around
only as long as you have at least one Office applica-
tion open. The minute all your Office apps get closed,
the Office Clipboard and all its contents go to the big
bit bucket in the sky. You can start the Office
Clipboard by

Choosing Edit➪Office Clipboard.

Bringing up any Office task pane, clicking the
down arrow on the pane’s title bar, and then
choosing Clipboard.

Pressing Ctrl+C twice. That can happen if you
hold down the Ctrl key and press C twice. But it
also happens if you press Ctrl+C, get up from
your desk to answer the Call of Nature (or any
other call, for that matter), come back to your
desk, and absentmindedly press Ctrl+C again.

Copying something to the Windows Clipboard
(by pressing Ctrl+C, for example), pasting what
you copied (perhaps with Ctrl+V), and then
copying something else to the Windows
Clipboard. You have to do all that while in the
same Office program. The copy-paste-copy
Office has a second, more powerful Clipboard that
you can call up and use. You have to explicitly start
the Office Clipboard. If you don’t start it, the Office
Clipboard stays out of the way, and your copying
and pasting only takes place on the old-fashioned
Windows Clipboard.
The Office Clipboard’s main claim to fame? It has 24
cubbyholes. And after it’s started, Office’s Clipboard
works in tandem with the Windows Clipboard. You
can tell that the Office Clipboard is running by look-
ing for its little icon down in the Windows
Notification Area, next to the clock (see Figure 9-1).
• Figure 9-1: The Office Clipboard can hold up to 24 items.
After you start the Office Clipboard, it gathers items
pasted onto the Windows Clipboard even if you 
didn’t paste them from Office. The last 24 items that
you copied or cut from any program — Notepad,
CorelDRAW, Paint, Adobe Acrobat, Uncle Ned’s Golf
Handicapper — all go onto the Office Clipboard.
The Office Clipboard doesn’t interfere with the
Windows Clipboard. The Windows Clipboard always
contains the contents of the most recently used cub-
byhole in the Office Clipboard. The Office Clipboard
acts like a packrat, watching the Windows Clipboard
to see whether there’s anything new, storing away
the last 24 items that were put on the Windows
Clipboard.

Moving Stuff Onto and Off the Office Clipboard
61
combination automatically brings the Office
Clipboard to life, and along with it the Clipboard
pane, the Clipboard icon in the system tray, and
the little message — the whole nine yards.
This last method of starting the Office
Clipboard is a bit obscure, but if you’ve ever
wondered why the Clipboard pane suddenly
jumped in your face, you must’ve copied,
pasted, then copied again, in that order, all
within the same Office program. Frankly, this
is one Clipboard function that I find distract-
ing, and I explain how to turn it off in
“Customizing the Clipboard” later in this
Technique. 
Moving Stuff Onto and Off 
the Office Clipboard
The best way to get to know the Office 2003
Clipboard is by taking it for a little test drive. You
might recognize some of the following functions, but
others are lesser-known:

To start the Office Clipboard and copy some-
thing to the Clipboard, select whatever you
want to copy (such as text in a Word docu-
ment), hold down the Ctrl key, press C twice,
and release the Ctrl key. (Ctrl+C is the nearly
universal key combination for copying in
Windows.) The text that you select is copied to
the Windows Clipboard as well as to the Office
Clipboard. When you copy something to the
Clipboard, Word (or any other Office application)
brings up the Office Clipboard pane (refer to
Figure 9-1).

To add something else to the Office Clipboard
after you’ve started it, press Ctrl+C. Office adds
the item to the top of the Office Clipboard and
also tells you that a second item has been col-
lected by flashing a small message above the
Windows notification area (see Figure 9-2). The
message appears only for a few seconds.
• Figure 9-2: Notification that a second item is added
to the Office Clipboard.

To see how many items are on your Clipboard,
check the Clipboard pane or the system tray.
The Office Clipboard pane indicates that the first
(of 24) cubbyhole(s) contains the text that you
just selected and copied. At the same time, Office
puts an icon in the Windows system tray notifica-
tion area, next to the time. If you hover your cur-
sor over that icon, a small message appears that
tells you how many items are currently on the
Office Clipboard.

To see all the different elements on your
Clipboard, just glance at the Clipboard pane.
For example, in Figure 9-3, you can easily see that
the pane contains a picture and two different
selections of text.
• Figure 9-3: A picture and two pieces of text on the Office
Clipboard.

Technique 9: Copying and Pasting in a Nonce

2.
Choose Edit➪Office Clipboard.
You see the Clipboard pane.
3.
At the bottom of the pane, click the Options
button.
The Office Clipboard lets you change its settings
(see Figure 9-4).
• Figure 9-4: All the major Office Clipboard settings appear
here.
4.
To stop the surprisingly intrusive Clipboard
behavior, turn off the Show Office Clipboard
Automatically setting.
You can adjust other settings if you like (see
Table 9-1).
5.
Click anywhere outside the settings area, and
Office remembers your choices.

To insert an element (such as text or a picture)
from one of the Office Clipboard’s cubbyholes
into an Office document, click the down arrow
next the element and choose Paste. The text is
pasted into the document wherever you’ve posi-
tioned your cursor, just as you would expect.

To insert all the elements on the Clipboard,
click the Paste All button. The Office Clipboard
pastes each item, in turn, into the document,
starting with the item on the bottom (that is, in
the first cubbyhole), then the second item, and
then the third (the picture on top).
It all works pretty much as you would expect, after
you realize that the Office Clipboard cubbyholes go
from bottom to top. But there are some interesting
timesaving settings that I describe later in this
Technique.
Unless you do something to start the Office
Clipboard, it stays out of the way — you get
the normal, plain, one-cubbyhole Windows
Clipboard, and that’s all she wrote. Most of the
time, the Windows Clipboard is all you need.
But if you’re trying to juggle multiple chunks
of text or pictures, bring up the Office
Clipboard and have at it.
Customizing the Clipboard
Remember Clippit, the not-so-handy Office Assistant,
who was always asking questions and getting in the
way? Well, like Clippit, the Office Clipboard’s habit of
popping up while you’re copying and pasting can be
mighty intrusive. Here’s how to trim its wings so that
the Clipboard doesn’t sidetrack you while you’re
working and appears only when you really need it:
1.
Start one of the Office programs.
Doesn’t matter which one: If you change the Office
Clipboard in one program, you change it in all.

Replacing the Office Clipboard
63
Replacing the Office Clipboard
So what’s not to like about the Office Clipboard?
For starters

You’re limited to 24 items, and they disappear
when the last Office application turns out the
lights.

There’s no way to organize or search through the
contents of the Clipboard — and those picture
thumbnails can be mighty hard to see.

None of the items in the Clipboard has a history —
you have no way to know where it came from or
when it was copied or pasted.

You can’t edit anything inside the Clipboard —
can’t take out line breaks, or trim down pictures,
or strip extraneous text.

with it, get ClipMate. Life’s too short. Office XP is a
little better, but there’s no way to keep the Clipboard
pane from bouncing to life, even when you’d rather
never see it again.

Keying
Combinations
Quickly
I
don’t memorize keyboard shortcuts very often. They kind of grow on
me, whether I want them to or not. If you’ve been using Office since
the dawn of time, you already have your own favorite pack of short-
cuts. But if you aren’t so encumbered, it might be worthwhile to learn a
few new tricks — shortcuts that can really save you time.
Although it’s true that using keyboard shortcuts can be enormously
faster than diving for the mouse, it’s also true that my brain hiccups
when I ask it to conjure up an obscure key combination. The net effect,
in either case, is an abrupt pause in my ability to get work done. So I
don’t take shortcuts lightly. You shouldn’t either.
Forget about memorizing every keyboard shortcut you come across. Life’s
too short. But some key combinations are so important that every Office
user needs to get them down. And that’s where this Technique comes in.
Exploiting Vital Shortcuts
The Clipboard shortcuts, which I list in Table 10-1, should become a part
of every Office user’s repertoire. You will save so much time with these
shortcuts that they should become second nature.
If the Office Clipboard is running (see Technique 9), copying to the
Windows Clipboard also places the item in the last cubbyhole of the
Office Clipboard. Pasting from the Windows Clipboard is the same
thing as pasting from the last cubbyhole. There are no direct key-
board shortcuts for pasting other items from the Office Clipboard
or for pasting all or clearing the Office Clipboard entirely.

The second group of vital Office shortcuts, in

Drawing Quickly
Y
ou might think that your Office document — Word doc, Excel
spreadsheet, or PowerPoint slide — looks and acts a lot like a
sheet of paper. In some respects, it does. But the minute you get
involved with drawing, that wonderful, flat, reliable piece of paper starts
evolving into a multidimensional, snarly beast.
If you think of your document as a flat piece of paper, you’re going to
get burned, over and over again. I can’t even begin to imagine how
much time Word users have lost trying to figure out why their clip art
(or pictures) does (or doesn’t) move (or stay put) the way it should.
That’s the topic of Technique 24.
It all harkens back to the drawing layer, which you need to understand
if you expect to save any time at all with Office’s drawing tools. This
Technique shows you how to coexist with the drawing layer — a kind of
warp in the flat-paper, space/time continuum, if you will — and draw on
your documents quickly and accurately. Although you might find it faster
to buy a box of colored pens.
Drawing on the Drawing Layer(s)
On the surface, Word documents, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spread-
sheets look like flat pieces of paper. (Well, okay, a PowerPoint slide is
supposed to look like a slide, but you get my drift.) But if you dig below
the surface. . . .
Imagine this for a moment. You’ve sweated and strained for two weeks,
and you finally have your résumé formatted precisely the way you want
it. You print a copy and take it home. (What? You never worked on your
résumé at the office before? Sheeesh.) Somehow, while you’re fixing din-
ner, your three-year-old finds the résumé, pulls out a garish red marker,
and makes giant scribbles all over it. That’s the drawing layer.

Drawing on the Drawing Layer(s)
71
Word doesn’t let you draw inside the document
itself. You can’t mix garish red scribbles with the
perfectly formatted 11-point Garamond text on your
résumé. But you can draw on top of your résumé,
just like your three-year-old. You use the drawing
layer like this:
1.
Open a Word document.
If you have a résumé handy, it’ll do.
2.
If you can’t see the Drawing toolbar at the bot-
tom (it starts with a button that reads Draw),
right-click an empty spot on the menu bar and
select the Drawing check box (see Figure 11-1).
• Figure 11-1: My résumé, pre-toddler rampage.
3.
You have to get rid of a particularly obnoxious
Word setting before you can scribble on your
résumé, so choose Tools➪Options➪General
and clear the Automatically Create Drawing
Canvas When Inserting AutoShapes check box;
then click OK.
See the upcoming sidebar, “Word’s Ignominious
Drawing Canvas.”
4.
On the Drawing toolbar, choose AutoShapes➪
Lines and pick the Scribble drawing tool in
the lower-right corner of the submenu (see
Figure 11-2).
If you aren’t already in Print Layout view, Word
switches over to it. (Otherwise, you wouldn’t be
able to see what you’re scribbling!)
• Figure 11-2: Choose the Scribble drawing tool.
5.
Scribble.
Really. Pretend you’re a three-year-old, hold
down the left mouse button, and draw loopy
scribbles all over the document (as shown in
Figure 11-3). When you’re done, release the left
mouse button.
6.
With the Scribble tool still selected (it has dots
all around it, like a selected picture), click the
down-arrow next to the Line Color icon on the
Drawing toolbar (it looks like a fountain pen)
and choose a bright red.
Of course. You could see it coming, couldn’t you?
7.
Click the Line Style tool on the Drawing toolbar
(a stack of three solid lines) and choose one of
the big, thick lines.
If you did everything right, you should see a giant
red scribble all over your résumé. Of course, the
scribble isn’t in your document at all. Rather, it’s
sitting in the drawing layer on top of your docu-
ment. That’s why you can click the scribble itself
and drag it any place you like — it moves around
in the drawing layer, out of harm’s way.

Technique 11: Drawing Quickly
72
9.
Print the document (File➪Print) or just take a
look in Print Preview (File➪Print Preview; see
Figure 11-5).
Convince yourself that the scribble is there —
it’s just floating above the document.
• Figure 11-5: Even though you can’t see it in Normal view,
the scribble exists — just on a different plane.
So far, you have seen the drawing layer on top
of your document. In fact, Word maintains two
drawing layers — one on top of and one under-
neath the main layer of the document.
10.
If you’re in Print Preview, click Close.
11.
Go back into Print Layout view by choosing
View➪Print Layout.
You see the document with the scribble on top
(refer to Figure 11-4).
12.
Click once on the scribble to select it; then
right-click the scribble and choose Order➪
Send Behind Text.
Word dutifully puts the scribble in the draw-
ing layer behind the text on the page (see 
Figure 11-6).
• Figure 11-3: I think my résumé looks better this way,
frankly.
8.
To see what’s happening, choose View➪
Normal.
The scribble disappears. Word doesn’t show the
drawing layer when you’re in Normal view (see
Figure 11-4). Scroll up, scroll down. You won’t
find it anywhere.
• Figure 11-4: In Normal view, it’s back to the dull same-
old, same-old.

Sketching Basic Shapes
73
• Figure 11-6: Drawings can live in the drawing layer
underneath the main part of the document
as well.
13.
Choose File➪Close — and no, you don’t want to
save changes.
Unless you want to save the scribble, of course.
If you accidentally save a scribble-enhanced
version of your résumé, just click the scribble
once and then press the Delete key. Drawings
are easy to delete.
Word has drawing layers above and below the main
text on the page. Excel and PowerPoint have only
one drawing layer, and it’s on top of the spreadsheet
or the slide. (You can’t put pictures directly into a
spreadsheet or a slide; they always sit on top.)
The drawing layer(s) exhibits all sorts of strange
behavior. You can waste a lot of time — days, 
weeks — trying to figure out why a particular Word
feature won’t work in the drawing layer. At a mini-
mum, you should realize that

Text that you type in the drawing layer, no mat-
ter how it’s formatted, will never appear in a
Table of Contents, Table of Figures, or any other
automatically generated Word reference table.

Automatic caption numbering and style-based
numbered paragraphs don’t work in the drawing
layer.

Many other features that you take for granted
(alignment in table cells, for example) might or
might not work in the drawing layer.
There’s a difference between drawings, which
are made with Word’s drawing tools, and
inline pictures. See Technique 24 for details.
Word’s Ignominious Drawing Canvas
Word 2003 has an obnoxious habit — I refuse to call it a
feature — of putting a “canvas” in the drawing layer every
time you use one of the Drawing toolbar’s tools. The idea is
sweetness and light itself: If you draw on the canvas, Word
will treat everything that you draw as a group, so you can
stretch, scale, and move them as a single unit. The items on
a canvas all appear on the same page. And so on.
In practice, the drawing canvas is horribly intrusive. It slams
the screen around so you can’t draw where you thought
you were going to draw. It adds an entire layer of settings
and potential problems where getting things done is time-
consuming anyway. In the end, the drawing canvas gets in
the way unless you have a whole bunch of pictures that you
want to treat as a single unit — and if that’s the case, you
should learn about grouping.
I tell you how to turn off the drawing canvas in Technique 15,
along with changing all the rest of Word’s intrusive settings,
but you can just follow Step 3 in the preceding procedure
to put Word out of its misery.
Sketching Basic Shapes
The Office drawing tools are phenomenally easy to
use, and as long as your drawing needs are modest,
you can turn out simple stick figures in a snap.
Constraining a line
Here’s all it takes to draw a straight line:

Technique 11: Drawing Quickly
74
• Figure 11-8: Making the line thick takes a couple more
clicks.
You can constrain the line by holding down certain
keys while you drag. The mechanics are easy and
quick, after you figure out how:
1.
Click the Line icon on the Drawing toolbar.
2.
Click to start the line and keep holding down
the mouse button.
3.
Press the constraining key (see Table 11-1).
4.
When the line looks right, release the mouse
button and then release the constraining key.

The line starts at the first click
and then gets constrained to 
15-degree intervals from the
horizontal.
Click, Ctrl, release
The line is centered at the first click.
Click, Alt, release
The end of the line is constrained
to fall at the corner of a spread-
sheet cell.
Fletching an arrow
To draw an arrow:
1.
Start the Office application.
In this case, I’m working in Excel.
1.
Start the Office application.
In this example, I work with Excel. (Yeah, yeah, I
don’t want to mess with the drawing canvas —
see the “Word’s Ignominious Drawing Canvas”
sidebar elsewhere in this Technique. Do you
blame me?)
2.
If you can’t see the Drawing toolbar (the first
button reads Draw), right-click an empty spot
on the menu bar and mark the Drawing check
box (refer to Figure 11-1).
3.
Click the Line icon on the Drawing toolbar.
It’s immediately to the right of the AutoShapes
button.
4.
Click once on the spreadsheet (actually, in the
drawing layer on top of the spreadsheet) where
you want the line to begin, hold the mouse but-
ton down, and release the button where you
want the line to end.
Your line appears on top of the spreadsheet (see
Figure 11-7).
• Figure 11-7: Drawing a straight line takes a few clicks.
5.
To change the color and thickness of the line,
first click it once to select it.
 Color: Choose a color by clicking the down
arrow next to the Line Color icon (which
looks like a pen).
 Line thickness: Choose a line size by click-
ing the Line Style icon (see the results in
Figure 11-8).

2.
If you can’t see the Drawing toolbar, right-click
on an empty spot on the menu bar and mark
the Drawing check box (refer to Figure 11-1).
3.
Click the Arrow icon on the Drawing toolbar.
4.
Click once on the spreadsheet where you want
the butt of the arrow, hold down the mouse
button, and release the button where you want
the arrowhead to appear.
Arrow drawings can be constrained in all the ways
that I describe in the preceding section. You can also
modify the appearance of the arrowhead — both at
the butt and at the point of the arrow:
1.
Draw the arrow, using the preceding steps.
2.
Right-click the arrow and choose Format➪
AutoShape➪Colors and Lines.
The Format AutoShape dialog box appears (see
Figure 11-9).
• Figure 11-9: Choose arrowhead styles and sizes — even
for the butt of the arrow.
3.
From the respective drop-down lists, choose a
Begin Style and size for the butt of the arrow
and an End Style and size for the tip.
Make any other changes that you like in this dia-
log box, including the color, line size, whether
the line is dashed or solid, and so on.
4.
Click OK.
The arrow takes on the characteristics that you
specify.
If you want all future items that you draw with
the Drawing toolbar in this document to have
the characteristics of the arrow that you just
formatted (line color, thickness, arrowhead
style and size, and so on), right-click the arrow
and choose Set AutoShape Defaults. 
Rolling your own shapes
If you need to draw your own shapes, the most
powerful tool in the Drawing toolbar arsenal is the
so-called Freeform tool. With the Freeform tool, you
can draw straight lines or curves or even make a
single line with both straight and curved segments.
You can also connect the ends of the line to form a
closed shape. Here’s how:
1.
Start the Office application. If you can’t see the
Drawing toolbar, right-click an empty spot on
the menu and mark the Drawing check box
(refer to Figure 11-1).
2.
Choose AutoShapes➪Lines and choose the
Freeform tool, the penultimate icon (see 
Figure 11-10).
• Figure 11-10: The Freeform drawing tool.

Technique 11: Drawing Quickly
76
Adding AutoShapes
In the preceding section, I show you how to draw
lines, arrows, and freeform lines. All three of those
shapes are AutoShapes — shapes that the Drawing
toolbar provides for you to construct your own
drawings. In fact, every shape on the Drawing tool-
bar (including line, arrow, rectangle, oval, and text
box) is an AutoShape.
The Drawing toolbar includes hundreds of
AutoShapes that you can use in a wide variety
of situations to save all sorts of time.

Need curly braces and brackets to group
together a number of lines of text? Look in
Basic Shapes.

Want to draw a flowchart? Use the Flowchart
AutoShapes, of course, but don’t overlook the
Block Arrows that tie them together.

Printing certificates or awards? Look at Stars and
Banners.

Have a point you want to emphasize? Callouts!
By default, AutoShapes are opaque — you
can’t see through them. That’s great for cover-
ing up blemishes on a photo (mine doesn’t
count), but most of the time you want to be
able to see what’s under the shape. To make
an AutoShape transparent, right-click it and
choose Format AutoShape➪Colors and Lines.
In the first Color box (under Fill), choose No
Fill; in the Color box under Line, choose No
Line (see Figure 11-12). Click OK, and you get
a see-through shape. To make all future
AutoShapes in the document transparent,
right-click that shape and choose Set
AutoShape Defaults.
Unfortunately, setting AutoShapes defaults that
“stick” across multiple documents is a monumental
pain in the neck. You’d think Microsoft would’ve
figured out by now that some people want to have
3.
Click where you want to start drawing.
 To draw a straight line: Release the mouse
button and move the mouse to where you
want the end of the line to appear; then click
again.
 To draw a curved line: Hold down the mouse
button and draw, releasing the button when
you want to start a new segment.
It sounds complicated, but if you try it a cou-
ple of times, you’ll get the hang of it (see 
Figure 11-11).
• Figure 11-11: The Freeform tool lets you mix straight
segments and hand-drawn curves.
4.
If you want a closed shape, click near the place
where you started drawing.
5.
If you want an open shape, double-click where
you want the shape to stop.
Easy. Fast. Not very good-looking, but it’ll do.
To modify a freeform drawing, on the Drawing
toolbar, choose Draw➪Edit Points. Office lets
you click and drag the ends of each of the
segments of the freeform shape.
If you close the shape — click near the place
where it started — you can fill the shape with
a color.

Adding AutoShapes
77
all their AutoShapes in all their documents trans-
parent, but nooooooo. . . . See Technique 16 for a
workaround.
• Figure 11-12: To make a shape transparent, set it to No
Fill and No Line.
Basic rules for creating an AutoShape are straightfor-
ward: Click the shape, click the document, and then
drag to draw. Keep in mind that you can

Put text in almost any AutoShape (except you
can’t put text along lines). To do so, right-click
the shape and choose Add Text.

Tear off and float individual AutoShape toolbars.
Just click and drag the dotted line at the top of
the menu.

Constrain the drawing so that, for example, the
Oval tool makes only circles. To do so, you must
follow these instructions precisely:
1. Click the AutoShape’s icon.
2. Click in the document where you want the
shape to appear.
3. Continue to hold down the left mouse
button.
4. Push and hold down the appropriate draw-
ing constraint key (see Table 11-2).
5. Release the mouse button after the shape
looks right.
TABLE 11-2: SHAPE-CONSTRAINING KEYS
Press This
To Constrain the Shape Like This
Click, Shift, release
The upper-left corner of the shape
starts at the first click; then the
shape is constrained to be sym-
metric. (For example, a rectangle
becomes a square, and an oval
becomes a circle.)
Click, Ctrl, release
The shape is centered at the first
click.
Click, Alt, release
Only in Excel, the edge of the
shape is constrained to fall along
the edge of a spreadsheet cell.
Connecting Shapes
Excel and PowerPoint make it easy to draw lines between
shapes and have the lines “stick to” the shapes. They’re
called connectors, and you can use them by first drawing
the shapes that you wish to connect, choosing AutoShapes➪
Connectors, and then choosing the kind of connector that
you like. (Good information is available in online Help; search
for Connectors.)
Unfortunately, Word allows you to connect only AutoShapes
that sit on the same drawing canvas. (No, online Help doesn’t
tell you that.) Save yourself a bunch of time: If you need
connectors between your shapes — and you might for
complicated drawings and flowcharts — either create the
drawing in Excel or PowerPoint, or hold your nose and
enable the drawing canvas (see “Word’s Ignominious
Drawing Canvas” sidebar elsewhere in this Technique).

Technique 11: Drawing Quickly
78
When you have your shapes aligned, lock them
together so that you can treat them as a single
shape:
1.
Select the shapes that you want to treat as a
single shape.
Again, Ctrl+click works, as does lassoing.
2.
Choose Draw➪Group.
After the shapes have been grouped, you can
resize, move, or copy them — or even change
their formatting — as if they were one shape.
You can select an individual shape even if
it’s part of a group. First click the group to
select it. Then click the shape. It will be singled
out, and you can work on it independently of
the others. That can save you lots of clicks —
and the potential for messing up when you
regroup.
Grouping, Aligning, 
and Distributing
You can spend eons trying to line up your drawings —
or you can let Office do it. Guess which way is faster?
More accurate?
To align a bunch of shapes:
1.
Draw the shapes.
2.
Select the shapes that you want to align.
You might find it fastest to click the first shape,
hold down the Ctrl key, and then click each of
the other shapes, one at a time. In some cases,
it’s easier, faster, and more accurate to click
the Select Objects icon on the Drawing toolbar
(to the right of the Draw button), and lasso the
shapes that you want.
3.
On the Drawing toolbar, choose Draw➪
Align or Distribute and choose the alignment
method that you wish to apply (see Figure 11-13).
• Figure 11-13: Select the shapes and then let Office do the
aligning.

Shrinking Graphics
W
hen you need quality prints, it’s nice that your new camera can
take 2.5MB e-pictures, but when you need to stick a handful 
of those pics in a document or turn them into a PowerPoint
slideshow, those file sizes can make you feel like the ringmaster at an
elephant show.
Say your boss calls from Timbuktu and wants you to put together a little
PowerPoint presentation with a half-dozen pictures of the main store and
the staff, and then e-mail it to him . . . well, there’s another day down the
drain, trying to get another bloated document slammed together and
then crammed down the telephone line.
It’s an expensive, time-consuming pain in the neck to wrestle with files
that contain 10 or 20MB of data. Your programs don’t like to handle all
that extra weight, either. The good news is that Office has the tools for
cutting the flab out of your documents, and this short Technique
explains how to use ’em.
So get real, get slim, and save an enormous amount of time.
Picking Your Compression Battles
If you have a document that consists of screen shots or pictures pulled
off Web sites or graphics produced by a “draw” program, chances are
pretty good that they’re compressed already. But if you’re working with
photos from a digital camera, or high-resolution stock photography shots,
or anything generated by a computer bigger than a breadbox, you proba-
bly have a whole lot more data than you need. In this section, you find
out how much data your images really require to get the job done.

Technique 12: Shrinking Graphics

Can you see any difference in the quality of the
shots?
Neither could she.
Customizing Compression with PowerToys
Office offers two levels of compression — Print and Web.
They’re fast and easy to use if the pictures that you want to
compress are already inside a document, spreadsheet, or
presentation.
The Windows XP PowerToys, on the other hand, offers five
levels of compression and also allows for a customized
compression level. The PowerToys compression levels are
keyed to the size of the display screen — 640 x 480 image,
1024 x 768, and so on. PowerToys works directly on the
picture files. I talk about Windows XP PowerToys and its
compression routine in Windows XP Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies.
To get the PowerToy that deals with picture compression,
go to www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/
powertoys.asp and download the ImageResizer.exe
file.
Version notes: Picture compression was
introduced in Office XP. There’s nothing
analogous in Office 2000.
Office 2003 makes it fast and easy to shrink all
the graphics in a document. Why spend hours
fighting with huge, high-resolution graphics
inside your documents when tiny, only slightly
fuzzy shots are more than good enough?
Table 12-1 illustrates how you can reduce the file
size of an image and improve download times but
still get the image quality that you need for different
tasks. Compare the size of a typical picture file when
it comes from a plain-vanilla digital camera to the
compressed sizes, and notice how much you can
compress the file by using Office’s tools while main-
taining decent quality.
To see how this works, compare a pixel-filled image
to a compressed one. Figure 12-1 shows a Word docu-
ment that I put together for my mom, with a half-dozen
vacation pictures. It weighs in at 3.2MB. It would take
my mom about 15 minutes to download that docu-
ment over a dialup connection.
Figure 12-2 shows the same document after I used
Office’s built-in compression routines to bring the
pictures down to Web resolution (which I explain
how to do in the next section). It’s just 181KB, and
my mom could download that in less than a minute.

Compressing an Image
To compress a picture (or all the pictures) in a Word
document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presen-
tation, do the following:
1.
Start the application and open the document.
2.
If you want to compress one specific picture,
click it. If you want to compress all the pictures
in the document, click any convenient picture.
If you want to compress more than one
picture — but not all of them — you have to
compress each one manually, separately.
3.
Right-click the picture and choose Format
Picture➪Picture.
The Format Picture dialog box appears 
(see Figure 12-3).
• Figure 12-3: Finding the compression feature is a bit
difficult.

7.
Select the Compress Pictures check box if you
want Office to compress the pictures.
Leaving this check box clear is the same as
choosing No Change in the preceding step. In
other words, if this check box is clear, Office will
strip off unused (cropped) parts of the pictures,
but it won’t reduce the resolution.
8.
If you want Office to get rid of any cropped
out parts of the picture(s), mark the Delete
Cropped Areas of Pictures check box.
Normally, Office applications keep the cropped-
out sections embedded in the document in case
you edit the picture at some point in the future
and want to reclaim some of the cropped-out
part.
9.
Click OK.
Office responds with a warning that’s a little con-
fusing (see Figure 12-5). In fact, compressing the
pictures only reduces the quality of the pictures
inside the document. Your original pictures are
untouched.
• Figure 12-5: A rather confusing warning. Don’t worry —
your original pictures are safe and sound.
10.
Click Apply.
Office compresses and/or removes cropped
areas from the indicated picture(s) inside the
document.
As long as you know where to find the magic
Compress button, compressing pictures in a docu-
ment is fast and easy — and a great way to save 
time . . . not only for you but for whoever receives the
document!
4.
On the lower left, click the Compress button.
Office shows you the Compress Pictures dialog
box (see Figure 12-4).
• Figure 12-4: This dialog box does the work.
5.
Specify whether you want to compress just the
one currently selected picture or all the pic-
tures in the document.
6.
Choose a resolution.
 Web/Screen resolution is identified as 96 dpi
(dpi being a term that’s hard to define pre-
cisely because it doesn’t translate directly
into screen resolution). Suffice it to say 
that Web/Screen resolution looks good up to
1024 x 768, and reasonably good to 1280 x
1024 and even further. This is the leanest
choice.
 Print resolution is identified as 200 dpi. In
practice, you can get a decent 4-x-6-inch print
from pictures at this resolution, but at 6 x 9
and larger, they’re too fuzzy. Not as lean as
Web/Screen but still significantly squished.
 No Change means that Office won’t change
the resolution but will delete cropped-out
parts of the pictures, if so instructed (see
the next step).

Modifying Toolbars
M
icrosoft doesn’t design the Office toolbars to make your work
faster or easier. Microsoft designs toolbars to sell more copies
of Office.
Each version of Office wrings out the old toolbars and brings in the new.
Office has a frightful tendency to throw out default toolbar icons that have
become old hat for the sole and express purpose of bringing in ones that
show off new — and in many cases, dubious — features. How else can you
explain the fact that, in Word 2003, Microsoft dropped the Search for File
icon that appeared in Word 2002 — although, presumably, there’s just as
much searching in Word 2003 as there was a year previously — and added
icons for the Permissions, Research, and Read features, which didn’t exist
in Word 2002. Looks like a great marketing gimmick to me. Don’t be bash-
ful. Save time by making Office work your way.
After you’ve had a chance to use an application for a while, choosing
your own most-used icons for the toolbars can save you time all the
time — click after click after click.
Using Toolbars Effectively
Toolbars are the original Office timesaving technique. Instead of forcing
you to hunt and peck your way through layers and layers of menus, the
Office toolbars give you one easy, fast, central place to go to perform the
tasks that consume your waking, working hours.
All the Office apps have copious quantities of toolbars. Even lowly
PowerPoint, which seems to get the short end of the stick so many times,
has a dozen of them. The problem doesn’t lie in creating more toolbars;
the problem is making the toolbars that you use most often do the work
you want to do.
Technique
Save Time By
 Taking control of your
toolbars
 Removing icons that you
don’t use
 Adding icons that will
speed up your work
 Separating marketing
gimmicks from useful
features

Technique 13: Modifying Toolbars
84
Unless you’re stuck with a horribly tiny screen,
you will almost certainly speed up your work by
allowing both the Standard and the Formatting
toolbars to occupy separate lines at the top of
the screen. In fact, this is the very first change I
make to any and all Office PCs that I use.
To break free the screen real estate so that the main
toolbars can breathe
1.
Start Word.
2.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Options.
You see the Options tab of the Customize dialog
box, as shown in Figure 13-2.
• Figure 13-2: Make Word give the Standard and
Formatting toolbars enough room to
be useful.
3.
Enable the Show Standard and Formatting
Toolbars on Two Rows check box.
While you’re here, get rid of those horrible
bouncing adaptive menus by enabling the
Always Show Full Menus check box. I talk
about bouncing menus in Techniques 15, 25,
33, 43, and 52. I’m, uh, rather opinionated on
the topic.
If you’ve spent much time at all with Word 2003, you
know that there are more than just two toolbars. The
Standard toolbar and the Formatting toolbar — along
with the menu bar at the top of the screen — take
the lion’s share of your workaday clicking. But if you
choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars (see Figure 13-1),
you can see a list of 30 toolbars, just waiting to help
you with everything from Outlining to inserting
Japanese greetings.
• Figure 13-1: Choose your Word toolbars.
In fact, Word has dozens of toolbars. Only about
half of them can be brought up by using the Tools➪
Customize➪Toolbars command. For the rest, you
have to hunt around.
Both the menu bar at the top of the screen —
the one that reads File, Edit, View, and so on —
and the task pane that appears sporadically
on the right of the screen are considered to
be toolbars. In fact, it’s easy to drag an icon
onto the menu bar at the top of the screen,
using the steps in this Technique. If you run
out of room for icons on your normal toolbars,
don’t forget that the vast real estate on the
right side of the menu bar is always available.

Adding Recommended Icons
85
4.
Click the Close button.
Word allots one full line for the Standard toolbar
and another full line for the Formatting toolbar —
the way the Office gods intended.
5.
Repeat Steps 2–4 for Excel and then likewise
for PowerPoint.
Rearranging Toolbar Icons
Removing icons from any toolbar couldn’t be
simpler . . . if you know the trick. Permit me to
show you how to delete the Permissions icon on
the Word 2003 Standard toolbar — an icon that I
vow I will never use. You can use these steps in
any Office application to remove any other icon
that gets in the way of more useful icons, as well:
1.
Start Word.
2.
Locate the Permissions icon.
The Permissions icon (see Figure 13-3) allows
you to set permissions for a document: who can
view it, who can copy it or forward it, and when
it will self-destruct. Permissions/Information
Rights Management (IRM) strikes me as a half-
baked technology poised to bite many people in
the butt. Although IRM might improve with time,
that isn’t going to happen in the near future.
• Figure 13-3: Your mission: Get rid of this icon.
3.
Hold down the Alt key.
4.
Click the Permissions icon and drag it off the
toolbar. When the mouse pointer shows an X,
just let go of the mouse button.
That’s it. Poof. You’ll never see the Permissions
icon again unless you intentionally put it back on
the toolbar.
There’s a little subtlety here that I’m intention-
ally glossing over. When you start Word, you
see a new, blank document, which is based on
the Normal template, normal.dot. When you
drag an icon off a toolbar, in fact, you’re
changing the toolbar in normal.dot. If you
use other templates, things get complicated.
But for all intents and purposes, the four sim-
ple steps get rid of the icon. Good riddance,
I say.
Moving a toolbar icon is every bit as easy as delet-
ing one:
1.
Start the application ( Word, Outlook, Excel,
PowerPoint, or Access).
2.
Hold down the Alt key.
3.
Drag the icon from wherever it is to wherever
you want it to be.
Note that you can drag an icon onto the menu.
4.
When the mouse pointer turns into an I-beam
where you want the icon to go, let go of the
mouse button.
To copy an icon from one toolbar to another
(rare, but you might have a good reason for
doing so), hold down Ctrl+Alt and then click
and drag.
Restoring a Screwed-Up Toolbar
So you played too hard, and now you want to put your
toolbar back the way it was? No problem. Of the many
ways to do so, here’s my favorite.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars (refer to Figure 13-1).
Click once on the toolbar that you want to revert to its orig-
inal, pristine state. Then click the Reset button.
Adding Recommended Icons
Microsoft maintains a list of icons that people
frequently want to put on their toolbars. As long
as the icon that you seek is among this small group

Technique 13: Modifying Toolbars
86
4.
Click anywhere outside the list of icons.
The changes that you made show up on the tool-
bar immediately.
Office has a predefined sequence for new icons: It
always puts a new icon in the same location on the
toolbar. But, as I describe in the preceding section, it’s
very easy to drag any icon you like to a new location.
Making Any Command
a Toolbar Icon
Although it’s a little bit more work, you can put an
icon on any toolbar that will perform just about any
command. If you can click a menu and get an Office
app to do something, you can probably put an icon
on a toolbar of your choice that does precisely the
same thing.
For example, in all the Office apps, you can choose
File➪Save As to bring up the Save As dialog box. For
most people, most of the time, that’s no big deal.
You want to do a Save As maybe once a day or once
a week, and it isn’t worth cluttering up your toolbar
with a specific Save As icon.
Some people, though, use Save As all the time. For
those folks, it makes sense to put a Save As icon
some place very convenient, like on the main
(Standard) toolbar. Say you want to put a Save As
icon on Word 2003’s Standard toolbar. Here’s how:
1.
Start Word and choose Tools➪Customize➪
Commands.
Word shows you the Commands tab of the
Customize dialog box, as in Figure 13-5.
2.
Make sure that the Save In box at the bottom
of the dialog box reads either Normal or
Normal.dot.
That ensures that any changes you make to tool-
bars will show up in normal blank documents
(that is, ones that you haven’t applied other
templates to).
of preselected entries, adding the icon to the toolbar
is a snap:
1.
Click the down arrow on the far-right end of
the toolbar that you want to change.
2.
Click Add or Remove Buttons and then
select the name of the toolbar (for example,
Formatting).
You see a list of all the preselected icons (see
Figure 13-4). A check mark appears next to icons
that are already on the toolbar.
• Figure 13-4: Word’s preapproved list of icons for the
Formatting toolbar.
3.
Click to check any icons that you want to
appear on the toolbar.
You can clear any check mark by clicking, too, if
you want to get rid of a specific icon.

Making Any Command a Toolbar Icon
87
• Figure 13-5: Drag your choice of commands onto any
toolbar from this dialog box.
3.
On the left, under Categories, select File. On
the right, under Commands, click once on the
line that reads Save As.
File➪Save As is only an example. You can find
almost all menu commands — and hundreds of
additional commands that aren’t on any menu —
by scrounging around in the Categories and
Commands lists.
4.
Drag the line that reads Save As to whatever
toolbar location you like.
5.
When the mouse pointer turns into an I-beam
where you want the icon to go, release the
mouse button.
In Figure 13-6, I release the mouse button as soon
as the mouse pointer turns into an I-beam to the
right of the Save icon.
• Figure 13-6: Save As goes to the right of the Save icon.
6.
If you add an icon with a picture that you don’t
like, make sure the Customize dialog is still
open, right-click the image, choose Change
Button Image, and then pick a picture that
you like.
In Figure 13-7, I chose a diskette with a down
arrow.
• Figure 13-7: Choose a picture from the ones offered.
Sometimes you have to right-click the icon
and choose Change Button Image a second
time and then pick the new image again. This
appears to be a bug (or at least an oddity) in
the way Office switches from icons with text
into icons with both pictures and text. At any
rate, if you don’t get the picture you want the
first time, try, try, try again.
7.
If you add an icon with text that you want to
get rid of (Save As, in this case), right-click the
icon and choose Default Style.
8.
Click Close in the Customize dialog box, and
you can use your chosen icon on the toolbar
(see Figure 13-8).

• Figure 13-8: The new Save As icon.
You can paste any icon image onto a toolbar
icon by using the Paste Button Image com-
mand in Figure 13-7. My favorite program for
retrieving icon images is Icon Snatcher from
Creative Design. To download it, go to www.
cdiware.com. Click the Software tab, scroll
down to find Icon Snatcher, and follow the
instructions.

Getting Help
E
verybody needs Help sometimes. Master Office Help, and you’ll
save hours and hours of frustration. But before you delve into this
Technique, it helps to know what you’re up against. Here are my
big gripes about Office Help:

Microsoft keeps changing the way it works. Office Help is so different
from version to version that you have to keep relearning how to use it.
Never fear. MS will change it again; it’s still not right.

It’s hard to find an answer unless you already know the answer.
Major culprits: all the jargon and a lack of links. However, there are
some solutions, which I discuss in this Technique.

Help topics toe the Microsoft Party Line. Too often, Help explains
how Office should work — not how it really does work. To make things
worse, all too often, Microsoft uses Knowledge Base articles, and
Security Bulletins manage to obfuscate and not educate.

Topics are poorly connected. Frequently you find solutions to bits
and pieces of a problem, but only rarely is there an explanation of how
to solve an entire problem or how the pieces fit together.
Fortunately, I can show you ways to fight those problems — and ways to
get help that don’t involve Microsoft at all — such as reading this book,
for example.
Making Help Visible
I hate the Office 2003 Help interface. Even on a very-high-resolution moni-
tor, the Help pains, er, panes keep getting in the way. With the Help win-
dow sitting on top of the main window, I can’t get any work done, and if I
didn’t need to refer to Help, I wouldn’t have opened it in the first place.
As far as I’m concerned, if you’re going to be using Help extensively, the
first bit of help that everyone needs is to put Help in its place.

• Figure 14-2: The retrieved list of Help “hits” appears in
the task pane.
4.
In the Search Results pane, select the article
you want.
I chose the Draw a Line or Connector Help topic,
which appears. After you click a topic, Help
becomes unwieldy in one of two ways:
 If Help determines that you have a lot of
room on your screen, the topic goes in a task
pane-like strip on the right of the screen.
Even on a very-high-resolution monitor, the
Help task pane combined with the Help topic
on the right wastes a lot of room; nearly half
the monitor is taken up with Help, and when
you type in a document, the text gets slammed
around, trying to avoid the task pane.
 If you’re using a smaller screen, the Help
topic floats over the top of your document —
where you’re trying to work (see Figure
14-3). On a low-resolution monitor, the Help
Here’s how to access Help and make it visible while
you’re working:
1.
Start Word (or any other Office app; they all
work the same way).
2.
Press F1.
Word shows you the Word Help task pane (see
Figure 14-1).
• Figure 14-1: The Help pane connects to Microsoft’s Help
Web site.
3.
Type a search term in the Search For box and
press Enter.
Assuming that you’re connected to the Internet,
the Office Help engine runs out to Microsoft’s
Web site and returns a list similar to the one
in Figure 14-2. (I typed connector.) For tips on
search terms, see the next section, “Popping the
Question.”
The list of Help articles that you receive today
could well be different from the list that you
receive on the same query next week. Microsoft
has massive programs that monitor which arti-
cles are used and how people respond to them.
Based on the results, responses to inquiries get
rearranged from time to time.

Popping the Question
91
topic floats, but the topic’s window is just like
any other window: When you start typing in
your document, the Help topic goes away.
Hardly a good way to get help!
• Figure 14-3: This Help window is getting in the way.
If you’re trying to work quickly, both of these
results are very intrusive. To streamline your
work area, keep Help accessible but out of the
way. You only need to follow these steps once:
The Office app remembers what you did.
5.
The best solution I’ve found: Click the column
of dots to the left of the term Search Results
and then drag the task pane onto the docu-
ment. Then click the Auto Tile icon in the
topic window.
You can resize the Search Results task pane to
some extent and tuck it into a little-used corner
of the screen (see Figure 14-4). Clicking the Auto
Tile icon on the Help topic ensures that the Help
topic will continue to be visible even when you’re
typing in the document.
6.
When you’re through using Help, put the task
pane back where you got it by clicking and
dragging it to the right side of the screen.
You want to put the task pane back because if
you don’t, it’ll float on top of your document
even when you’re using it for something other
than Help.
• Figure 14-4: Drag the Search Results task pane onto the
document and click Auto Tile on the Help
topic.
If you have trouble dragging it back — the pane
has a nasty habit of clinging to the toolbars at
the top of the screen — drag it way over to the
right of the screen so that it’s almost off the
screen; then slowly drag it up.
Popping the Question
By far the easiest, fastest way to use Office Help is
by simply typing a few words in the Type a Question
for Help box at the far upper right of the screen. That
does precisely the same thing as bringing up the
Help task pane and typing in the Search For box.
Here are some quick tips for successful searches:

Get connected. Make sure you’re connected to
the Internet. If you’re unplugged, you only get
results from the comparatively tiny database
that’s installed on your computer.

Keep it short. Although it’s true that you can
phrase your question in the form of a question
(to coin a phrase), I invariably find that using
keywords in the Type a Question for Help box
produces better results.

Technique 14: Getting Help
92
Drilling Down Fast
Office 2003’s online Help includes thousands of how-
to articles and animated training sessions, most of
which cover topics quite superficially (see Figure
14-6). You can identify how-to articles by the ques-
tion-mark-on-top-of-a-document icon that appears in
the Search Results task pane (for example, in Figures
14-2 and 14-4).
• Figure 14-6: A very brief introduction to positioning
graphics in documents.
Many Office users look at a few how-to articles in
online Help and decide that they really don’t cover
the topic at the depth that they need. Most find that
the articles don’t solve the specific problem they
have at hand.
Don’t give up.

Try different keywords. If you don’t find what
you want the first time, use completely different
words the second time.

Stick with jargon. If you know the jargon, use the
precise term that describes what you’re after. If
you aren’t sure of the exact name of what you
want, use very generic terms and try drilling
down (see the next section, “Drilling Down Fast”).

Search the Table of Contents. When all else fails,
use the Help Table of Contents (see Figure 14-5).
You can go directly to a Table of Contents entry
by clicking the gray link below any result in the
Search Results task pane.
• Figure 14-5: Help’s Table of Contents might point in the
right direction.

Digging Deeper: The Knowledge Base
93
Each one of those articles contains oodles and
oodles of Microsoft jargon. If you ever find
yourself stuck in Help’s Search For box, look-
ing for the right word or words to describe
your problem, try running through a how-to
article. Even if the article you read is only
vaguely related, you can likely pick up the
jargon that you need to plug into the search
box — jargon that will lead you to the answers
you seek. That’s the best way I know to find
answers to common questions, fast.
Digging Deeper: The 
Knowledge Base
When you go looking beyond the basics, Office’s
online Help won’t, uh, help. You have to haul out the
big guns and refer directly to Microsoft’s Knowledge
Base (KB).
The Knowledge Base is Microsoft’s massive refer-
ence for everything related to MS products. Whereas
mere mortals like you and me can see only part of
the Knowledge Base (Microsoft doesn’t air its dirty
linen in public), the KB that we can see includes
detailed articles on thousands — hundreds of
thousands — of topics.
To put it a slightly different way: Office online Help
tells you how Office is supposed to work. Some parts
of the Knowledge Base tell you how Office really does
work. (Unfortunately, there’s plenty of fluff in the KB,
too. But it isn’t nearly as bad as online Help.)
Using the KB isn’t much different from using online
Help:
1.
Bring up Internet Explorer and go to
http://support.microsoft.com.
This is Microsoft’s general support page (see
Figure 14-7).
• Figure 14-7: A good place to start if you’re looking for
more help than Office online Help can give.
2.
Click the Search the Knowledge Base link.
You get the KB search page (see Figure 14-8).
• Figure 14-8: Start your search here.
3.
Pick the product that you’re concerned about
in the Select a Microsoft Product drop-down
list.
Specifying a product is a frequently over-
looked key step. There’s so much in the KB
that blindly searching for keywords without
limiting the search to a specific product really
wastes your time.

Technique 14: Getting Help
94
When you call Microsoft Tech Support, the techni-
cian’s first line of inquiry is the Knowledge Base —
the same Knowledge Base that you can search, using
this Technique. You can save a lot of time (and
money!) if you learn to do it yourself.
Every Knowledge Base article has a six-digit number
up at the top of the article. That’s a mighty handy
way to keep track of problems and their solutions;
advanced users refer to article numbers (for exam-
ple, KB123456) all the time. If you want to find an
article again, make sure you get the number.
At the bottom of every Knowledge Base article,
you’ll see a last-reviewed date (see Figure 14-10).
The date can give you a feel for whether Microsoft
has come up with a new approach to solving a prob-
lem or whether you’re looking at an article that’s
been gathering dust for eons. Most have version
numbers — a welcome addition that should put to
rest lingering ill feelings about Microsoft changing
KB articles surreptitiously to cover up stupid mis-
takes. If you look at a KB article and it’s up to, oh,
version 2.1, you can bet your bottom buck that
Microsoft’s been struggling with the problem, too —
and might not have it right yet. Ach, the stories I
could tell!
• Figure 14-10: Glance at the bottom of a KB article to get
an idea of how recently it’s been updated —
and how many times it’s been fixed.
A Word about Connectors
You might have noticed that I use the same example
throughout this Technique, searching for help on connec-
tors. There’s a reason why. When I was writing Technique 11,
I hit a repeated problem trying to get connectors — the
“stick to” lines between shapes in the drawing layer — to
stick to AutoShapes. All the online Help explained precisely
how connectors work. Er, how they’re supposed to work. A
Web search through Google came up with zip. I’ve written
about connectors a dozen times and had no problems.
4.
Type the keyword(s) in the Search For box and
then click Go.
The KB returns with as many matches as you
specified. In Figure 14-9, six articles match my
search criteria.
• Figure 14-9: Although many KB articles are very
technical, some of the how-to articles
are readable — and even accurate.
5.
If you didn’t find what you want, click the Back
button in your browser and try a different
search.
Sometimes searching for older versions will
ferret out results that apply to later versions.
For example, if you search for a keyword in
Office 2003 and come up with bupkis, try
searching for the same keyword in Office XP.
I’m frequently pleasantly surprised.
Don’t limit your searches to the product at
hand: if you hit a problem in Word, try search-
ing in Excel. Sometimes searching in another
Office application area can return good results,
especially when checking an operation error
that might have caused Office to not properly
function or dealing with some features that are
common to all of Office.

Even the KB produced no results — as you can see in vari-
ous screen shots throughout this Technique. I lost hours try-
ing to find an answer.
In the end, I got lucky. I finally guessed that the drawing
canvas might be the key and, as described in Technique 11,
turning on the canvas solves the problem. It’s a good exam-
ple of a simple problem that isn’t documented anywhere.
Office has zillions of problems like that. Zillions.
Finding Help from Other Users
The best way to get help is to ask someone who
knows. Many Office guri work for pizza and beer.
They’re good people to get to know.
A surprisingly large number of kind-hearted Office
folks hang out online, and many of them will tackle
problems just for the challenge and an occasional
heart-felt thank you.
Many of those good folks — volunteers all — 
hang out on my message site, the WOPR Lounge.
Drop by www.wopr.com/lounge sometime when
you’re up a creek without a paddle, and see
whether one of the people there can lend a hand.
You’ll also find lots and lots of help in the 
Microsoft-run newsgroups. Look on the server
msnews.microsoft.com for newsgroups beginning
with microsoft.public.
Finally, don’t forget to subscribe to my free
weekly Office newsletter, Woody’s Office Watch,

subscribers, the Watches are the one source of
(fiercely independent!) help that all Office users
need.

Saving Time with Word

Getting Word
Settings Right
R
ight out of the box, Word is designed to make it easy for new users
to understand what they’re doing. Of course, it fails miserably. Try
to explain to your Word-neophyte friends why typing 1. and a few
letters and then pressing Enter suddenly starts adorning paragraphs with
phantom numbers that you can’t delete — or even select, for that matter. 
I think that Microsoft underestimates the intelligence of its users and
overestimates their desire for whiz-bang, so-called features that only
get in the way. Keep it simple, sez I. If you’ve used Word for more than
a few weeks, it’s time to take off the training wheels. That’s what this
Technique is all about.
Word bunches unrelated settings in different dialog boxes with the con-
sistency of a kangaroo on a random walk. For the sake of my sanity (and
saving your time) in this Technique, I group recommended changes
together based on their location in the Word menus. It’s a terribly dis-
jointed approach, but by knocking off all the settings in one fell swoop,
dialog box by dialog box, you should be able to breeze through this
Technique in minutes.
If you aren’t particularly interested in the why and want to cut
straight to the what, skip the text and set your settings to look
like those in the figures.
Blistering the Bouncing Menus
At the top of my most-hated list: the fact that my menus don’t stay put.
I hate adaptive menus — the ones that go boing-boing-boing when you
click them. (Microsoft calls them personalized or animated menus.)
Hunting and searching for menu items, trying to find them when they’ve
been moved around, rates as a class-A waste of time. Your eyes and fin-
gers should grow accustomed to menus being in a certain place. Why go
looking?

3.
Mark the Always Show Full Menus check box.
That keeps your menus from bouncing around
like a jumping bean in a microwave.
4.
Click Close.
Seeing Clearly
Microsoft’s second greatest design gaffe is trying to
hide key information from you. It’s time to see all the
pieces that are making your life miserable.
To get your View settings straight
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View.
Word shows you the View tab of the Options dia-
log box (see Figure 15-2).
• Figure 15-2: These settings control what you see
onscreen.
A close second: the fact that Word, straight out of
the box, doesn’t show me all the buttons on my two
most-used toolbars.
Start with the Customize dialog box:
1.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Options.
Word shows you the Options tab of the
Customize dialog box (see Figure 15-1).
• Figure 15-1: The Customize dialog box controls the
appearance of the menu and toolbars.
2.
Mark the Show Standard and Formatting
Toolbars on Two Rows check box.
I talk about this setting in Technique 13. You need
to be able to see all the icons on your two key
toolbars. If you’re running a monitor at incredi-
bly high resolution — well beyond 1280 x 1024 —
you might be able to see all the icons on one row.
But for those of us in economy class, Word needs
two rows. It’s utterly inconceivable to me why
Microsoft doesn’t make both toolbars fully visi-
ble, right out of the box.

Seeing Clearly
101
2.
Consider clearing the Windows in Taskbar
check box.
If you frequently tile multiple documents so
that you can see them all at once, you proba-
bly want to clear this check box. If switching
among open documents by clicking the taskbar
buttons is more your style, you probably want
to leave the box checked.
When the Windows in Taskbar box check box
is enabled, Word puts a separate entry on the
Windows taskbar for each open document (as
shown in Figure 15-3). That can be very handy
for switching between open documents. But
Word also insists on putting menus, icons,
rulers, and more inside the window for every
open document. That makes it difficult — if not
impossible — to work on three or more docu-
ments simultaneously. (Tile Word windows auto-
matically by choosing Window➪Arrange All.)
• Figure 15-3: Here’s how tiled Word windows and the
taskbar look with Windows in Taskbar
enabled.
When the Windows in Taskbar check box is
cleared, Word puts just one entry on the
Windows taskbar for all of Word. If you want
to switch among open documents, you have to
do it from inside Word itself (see Figure 15-4). On
the other hand, Word puts only one set of menus,
icons, and rulers in its window, for use by all
open documents.
• Figure 15-4: With Windows in Taskbar unmarked, only
one button is in the taskbar, and you have
more breathing room for multiple
documents.
Personally, I keep this check box enabled, but
then again, I don’t arrange multiple documents
on the screen all that often. Your mileage may
vary. 
I dunno why Microsoft doesn’t give us the obvi-
ous timesaving option — put multiple buttons
in the Windows taskbar but only use one set
of menus and icons. That’s the way Excel has
worked for a decade.
3.
Mark the Tab Characters check box.
If you do any work at all with tabs — in fact, even
if you press the Tab key accidentally — you’ll be
completely lost unless you can see Tab charac-
ters on the screen.

Technique 15: Getting Word Settings Right
102
6.
Set the Style Area Width to half an inch or
thereabouts.
The Style Area Width comes into play only when
you work in so-called Normal view. In Normal
view, Word shows you the names of the styles
to the left of each paragraph (see the left side of
Figure 15-5), providing that the Style Area Width
isn’t zero. Most of us usually work in Print Layout
view and only flip over to Normal view to pay
special attention to the text. That’s when you’re
most likely to want to see style names.
• Figure 15-5: In Normal view, if the Style Area Width is
not zero, the name of each paragraph’s style
appears to the left of the paragraph.
7.
Click OK.
Zapping the Drawing Canvas
Word calls these General settings. I think of them
as a miscellaneous-of-the-miscellaneous kind of
collection:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪General.
You see the General tab of the Options dialog
box (see Figure 15-6).
4.
Mark the Paragraph Marks check box.
Word stores all its paragraph formatting in the
paragraph mark. If you can’t see the paragraph
marks in a document, you don’t stand a chance
of understanding how formatting is being applied.
Personally, I won’t even look at a Word document
unless paragraph marks are showing.
Word users lose enormous amounts of time
trying to track down problems caused by
invisible paragraph marks. You probably know
that a paragraph’s style is stored in its para-
graph mark. But did you know that every
paragraph’s spacing, indent, and tab stop set-
tings are stored there, too? If you have an
autonumbered or autobulleted paragraph, all
the associated information is stored in the
paragraph mark, as are the alignment, boxes
and background shading, and a dozen differ-
ent settings. Heck, even a document’s section
settings — headers and footers, column spac-
ing, and the like — are in the final paragraph
mark. 
If all your paragraphs suddenly appear right-
aligned, or bold, or numbered, or if your tabs
aren’t working right, or bullets sprout up like
dandelions on a brand-new lawn, the para-
graph mark is invariably the culprit. The differ-
ence between copying a paragraph without
the paragraph mark at the end and copying it
with the paragraph mark can be devastating.
You need to be able to see your paragraph
marks.
5.
Mark the Object Anchors check box.
Floating pictures move with the paragraph they’re
attached to: Move the paragraph, and the picture
goes with it. Of course, that begs the question of
which paragraph the floating picture attached to.
Enable this check box, and Word shows a little
anchor symbol next to the paragraph that’s
attached to a picture. (See Technique 24 for
much more about floating and inline pictures.)

Taking Back Your Mouse

• Figure 15-6: Get rid of the drawing canvas here.
2.
Run the Recently Used File List up to 9 entries.
When you choose File, the list of most recently
used files appears at the bottom of the menu.
Microsoft originally set the number of files to be
displayed on the list at 4 when 640 x 480 moni-
tors were common (to conserve space). There’s
no reason at all to leave it at 4.
3.
Clear the Automatically Create Drawing Canvas
When Inserting AutoShapes check box . . .
. . . and drive a stake through its heart. I talk
about — indeed, rail against — this intrusive
setting in Technique 11.
You’ll encounter a few times when you really
must have a drawing canvas. Specifically, if
you need “stick on” connectors that move
when their attached shapes move (as you
likely would for a flowchart), Word requires
that your drawing go on a drawing canvas.
Unfortunately, Word doesn’t have an Insert➪
Drawing Canvas command or anything similar.
The only way that you can put a drawing can-
vas in your document is by enabling this check
box and then using the Drawing toolbar to
put an AutoShape in your document, thus
automatically generating a drawing canvas.
4.
Click OK.
Taking Back Your Mouse
The next set of settings deal with editing text:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Edit.
You see the Edit tab of the Options dialog box
(see Figure 15-7).
• Figure 15-7: A plethora of settings for editing.

Technique 15: Getting Word Settings Right
104
And don’t forget that you can frequently select
small pieces of text much more quickly and accu-
rately by simply holding down the Shift key and
pressing the right and left arrows.
If you want to select an entire word, you can
double-click it. To a first approximation, any-
way. The problem is that double-clicking a word
that’s followed by a space selects the word and
the space. But if you double-click a word that’s
followed by a punctuation mark or paragraph
mark, you get the word without the final
punctuation or paragraph mark (even if you
can’t see the paragraph mark). Life ain’t so
simple, eh?
5.
Mark the Prompt to Update Style check box.
In certain circumstances, Word will change the
definition of a style without even asking. (You
have to change formatting manually and then
reapply the style.) Word should always ask
before changing things.
6.
Click OK.
Correcting AutoCorrect
If you haven’t yet changed AutoCorrect — most
likely by using a Smart Tag to tell Word to keep its
hands off — this section alone will pay for the book.
Word has an absolutely infuriating habit of correct-
ing things that shouldn’t be corrected. I talk about
Word’s mangling of typed Web addresses and e-mail
addresses in Technique 7. That’s just one of the
problems. To correct the rest:
1.
Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect Options➪
AutoFormat As You Type.
Word gives you a list of all the things that it
changes while you are sleeping, er, typing (see
Figure 15-8).
2.
Consider clearing the Typing Replaces Selection
check box.
If this check box is marked, when you select
text and then type, the first letter that you type
replaces all the selected text. Most Windows pro-
grams work that way, but I personally don’t like
it. With the check box cleared, if you have some-
thing selected when you type, Word simply
moves to the beginning of the selection before
putting your typed text into the document.
3.
Clear the Use Smart Paragraph Selection
check box.
This setting exists only because Microsoft
doesn’t to show paragraph marks on the
screen by default. If you select the Use Smart
Paragraph Selection box (wink, wink), Word sur-
reptitiously selects the paragraph mark (nod,
nod) when you select all the text in a paragraph
(nudge, nudge). Why? Quoth Microsoft, “If you
include the paragraph mark when you cut and
paste a paragraph, you don’t leave a blank para-
graph, and your formatting automatically stays
with the paragraph.” This is a very convoluted
(and inaccurate) way of saying that Word stores
all its paragraph formatting in the paragraph
mark.
If you can see your paragraph marks — I show
you how in the earlier “Seeing Clearly” section —
you can decide for yourself whether you want to
select a paragraph mark. Don’t leave it up to
Word. Clear the check box.
4.
Clear the When Selecting, Automatically Select
Entire Word check box.
In fact, this intrusive IntelliNONsense setting
does much more than automatically select entire
words. Leave this check box enabled, and Word
wrests control of the mouse from your hands,
making even the simplest selecting jobs much
more time-consuming than need be.
If your mousing skills are anywhere near 
capable — much less proficient — the
Automatically Select Entire Word setting
eats into your productivity. Dump it.

Making Final Timesaving Changes
105
Most AutoFormat and AutoCorrect settings
are infuriating computer-knows-better-than-
you time sinks. Stop Word from fiddling with
your work and turn off most of these settings.
• Figure 15-8: Most AutoFormat settings only get in
your way.
2.
Consider clearing the Fractions (1/2) with
Fraction Character check box.
It’s misleading. Word is only capable of chang-
ing three fractions — 1⁄2, 1⁄4, and 3⁄4 — into single
characters. If you type any other fraction, Word
doesn’t even try to change it because Windows
doesn’t have fonts that can handle it. I’d rather
have all my fractions look the same, so I clear
this check box.
3.
Clear the Internet and Network Paths with
Hyperlinks check box.
I rant about this setting in Technique 7. Get rid
of it.
4.
Clear all the check boxes under Apply As You
Type.
If you’ve ever typed 1., some text, and then
pressed Enter — only to discover that Word cre-
ates bizarre numbered paragraphs with phantom
numbers that you can’t delete or even select —
you’ve been bitten by these settings. Tell Word
to keep its steeeeenkin’ hands off. If you want
bullets, you can click the bullet icon. Ditto for
numbered lists and border lines, and you can
click the Tables and Borders icon to draw your
own table, thank you very much.
5.
Clear the Format Beginning of List Item Like
the One before It check box.
This is a bizarre, badly documented setting with
almost unpredictable behavior. In Word 2002
(Microsoft didn’t even bother documenting the
setting in Word 2003), online Help says, “Auto-
matically repeats character formatting that you
apply to the beginning of a list item. For example,
if the first word or phrase of a list item is bold,
Word automatically applies bold formatting to
the first word or phrase of the next list item.”
One little problem: That isn’t the case, and if you
spend 30 seconds working with the setting, you’ll
see that. Get rid of it.
6.
Click OK.
Making Final Timesaving
Changes
I make two additional changes to Word:
1.
Choose View➪Ruler and turn off the rulers.
Most of the time, the rulers just get in the way.
Use the screen real estate to see more of your
document as you write. If you need to see the
horizontal ruler (the one at the top) for just a
second, move your mouse up and hover directly
underneath the Formatting toolbar (the one with
font names on it). The ruler stays on the screen
until you move your mouse.

Technique 15: Getting Word Settings Right
106
to see and use macros that other people send
you — although you will need to approve them
every time that you open the macro-enhanced
document or template.
4.
Click the Trusted Publishers tab.
Word shows you a list of software publishers —
actually a list of companies or individuals who
electronically sign their macros — whom you
have given blanket approval to run on your PC.
5.
If any publishers are listed, click each, one by
one, and then click the Remove button (see
Figure 15-10).
Why? Because there have been instances where
electronic signatures have been hijacked, includ-
ing a celebrated case where somebody conned
VeriSign into issuing two bogus Microsoft signa-
tures (news.com.com/2100-1001-254586.html).
Nobody has yet come up with a macro virus that
operates under the cloak of a hijacked signature.
But it could happen.
6.
Click OK.
• Figure 15-10: Make sure you have no trusted publishers.
Not even Microsoft. Especially not
Microsoft.
2.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Security.
Word responds with the Security dialog box (see
Figure 15-9).
• Figure 15-9: Change macro settings here, but only after
you know what the settings do.
3.
Select the Medium radio button.
Make sure you know what you’re doing when
you change the macro Security Level setting.
Unfortunately, when you set Word’s macro
security to High, all the macro babies get
thrown out with the bathwater: Word throws
away any macros attached to documents or
templates that you receive and doesn’t even
ask whether it’s okay to run them. Conversely,
if you set it to Low, Word doesn’t even scan
for viruses.
If you have a decent antivirus package installed
and you update it regularly and use it religiously —
and you follow my recommendation in the next
step — putting Word on Medium security should
not incur any significant risk. With security set at
Medium, you’ll have the advantage of being able

I have an important handful of additional suggestions
for changing Word’s default behavior, but they all
involve modifying a file called normal.dot. See
Technique 16 for details.
Saving Your Settings
After you have your settings the way that you want
them, store them away so they’re easy to bring

Technique
Changing Your
Normal Template
W
hen Word creates a new blank document, in fact, it makes a car-
bon copy of a template file called normal.dot. There’s nothing
particularly normal about normal.dot, but it does occupy a piv-
otal position in the Word hierarchy. As the progenitor of most of your
new documents (specifically it’s the template on which all new docu-
ments are based, unless you apply a different template), if you make a
change to normal.dot, that change gets picked up whenever you create a
blank document.
You can save a lot of time by creating templates for each of your most
common types of documents: status reports, sales proposals, internal
memos, and on and on. Think of anything that differs from your normal
kinds of documents in predictable ways (perhaps some boilerplate text
like a From the desk of line) as a good candidate for its own template.
This Technique shows you ways to save time by making overarching
changes once inside your templates, which carries those changes over
into all new documents created based on those templates. After you have
the foundation set, you can build templates to solve every problem. For
example, Technique 23 shows you how to make a letterhead template —
a very specialized and surprisingly difficult task.
Customizing Blank Documents
Every Word document is based on a template, which is a proto-document
that contains all the settings necessary to grow a new document. When
you tell Word to create a new document based on a template, Word 
basically makes a copy of the template and uses the copy as the new
document.
It’s a little more complicated than that but not much.

properties of all new
blank documents

Customizing Blank Documents
109
Whatever you add to template will show up
when you create a document using that tem-
plate. If you stick a picture of a gargoyle in a
template, every new document based on that
template will include the picture of the gar-
goyle. There’s nothing magical about the gar-
goyle in the new document: You can click it,
resize it, drag it, and even delete it. But it’s
there, right from the get-go.
One template, the Normal template (filename, normal.
dot), gets pressed into service whenever you create
a new blank document. If you click the New Blank
Document icon at the beginning of the Standard tool-
bar (see Figure 16-1), you don’t get a blank docu-
ment, per se. You really get a copy of normal.dot.
That’s also the case if you choose File➪New and
choose Blank Document from the top of the task
pane or if you choose File➪New➪Templates/
On My Computer➪General and double-click 
Blank Document.
• Figure 16-1: Click here to create a new blank document:
actually, a copy of normal.dot.
Microsoft has built a lot of fancy ways to
change normal.dot directly from inside vari-
ous dialog boxes — they’re called tunnels. But
the fastest, easiest, and most reliable way to
make changes to normal.dot is to simply
open it up and make the changes.
If you make the changes described in this
Technique to normal.dot, the new settings
propagate to any new templates that you cre-
ate based on normal.dot. For example, if you
change your privacy settings in normal.dot
and then create a new template for your
weekly status report, those privacy settings get
carried across.
To make changes that affect all new blank docu-
ments, do the following:
1.
Make sure that Windows is set up to show your
hidden folders.
The easiest way to do that is to choose Start➪
My Documents and then choose Tools➪
Folder Options➪View. Under Hidden Files and
Folders, click the Show Hidden Files and Folders
button, and then click OK.
2.
Start Word. Choose File➪Open. In the Files of
Type box, choose Document Templates.
3.
In the Look In box, navigate to
C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>
\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates.
You see the Open dialog box, shown in 
Figure 16-2.
• Figure 16-2: Normal.dot is tucked away in a hidden
folder.
4.
Double-click Normal.dot.
Word opens the file, just like any other document
or template.
5.
Choose Format➪Styles and Formatting.
Word brings up the Styles and Formatting task
pane (as shown in Figure 16-3).

Technique 16: Changing Your Normal Template
110
• Figure 16-4: Change Normal’s style.
If you select the Automatically Update check
box, Word automatically redefines the style
every time a document is opened, changing
the style in the document to match the style in
the template. If you never change styles in the
template, the automatic update isn’t a prob-
lem. But the minute a style gets changes —
even a little bit — the formatting in a docu-
ment can get thrown for a loop. And unless
you know that this setting is the cause of the
problem, it can take ages to figure out why
your document suddenly doesn’t look right.
10.
To change the default page settings — 
margins, paper size, and the like — choose
File➪Page Setup.
Word shows you the Page Setup dialog box for
normal.dot (see Figure 16-5). Personally, I think
Word’s default margin settings are way too wide,
so I change them to the settings shown in the fig-
ure. After you make the changes that you want,
click OK.
• Figure 16-3: The list of paragraph styles in normal.dot.
6.
To change the default font for new blank docu-
ments, click the down arrow to the right of
Normal and then choose Modify.
The Modify Style dialog box appears 
(see Figure 16-4).
7.
Choose Format➪Font from the lower left of the
dialog box and then choose your new default
font. When you’re done, click OK.
I’m partial to Garamond, 11 point for business
correspondence. No doubt you have your own
preference.
8.
If you want to change the default paragraph
style (perhaps to add extra spacing or to auto-
matically indent the first line of each para-
graph), choose Format➪Paragraph, make the
changes, and then click OK.
9.
When you’re done with the Modify Style dialog
box, click OK.
You don’t need to mark the Add to Template
check box — and for heaven’s sake, do not select
the Automatically Update check box. That’ll
cause you all sorts of trouble down the road.

Creating New Templates
111
• Figure 16-5: Change any of the default page settings for
new blank documents here.
11.
If you need to make any other changes to all
new blank documents, go ahead.
For example, if you want to have a standard
header or footer on your blank documents,
choose View➪Header and Footer and have at it.
If you want boilerplate text to appear in all your
new documents, just type it in the template. If
you want to put a subtle watermark on all the
pages (perhaps, From the Desk of Woody
Leonhard), see Technique 71.
12.
When you’re done, choose File➪Close.
Chances are good that Word won’t ask whether
you want to save changes — but if it does,
answer Yes.
Every new blank document that you create
will take on all the settings that you apply to
normal.dot. In addition, any new templates
that you create (see the next section) absorb
these settings, too. That’s a big timesaver.
You can go through the same basic steps that
I describe in this section to modify any tem-
plate that you create.
Creating New Templates
Custom templates can save you so much time that
you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.
Creating a good template is an art — and a difficult
art, at that. It would take a book this size just to hit
the high points. Basically, anything you can do with
a document, you can do in a template, and whatever
you do in the template applies in all future documents
based on that template.
Templates are enormously powerful timesaving tools
because they embody all the customizing you need,
and you need to perform the hard work only once.
For starters, you can have different settings (say,
different fonts or boilerplate text) for different 
templates.
To create a new template:
1.
Choose File➪New. In the New Document task
pane, click On My Computer. (It’s in the
Templates section.)
Word brings up the Templates dialog box 
(see Figure 16-6).
2.
Under the Create New heading (lower-right
corner), select the Template radio button and
then click OK.
Your new template is ready for customizing. You
can set formatting, add text, and whatever else
you want just as you would in a regular Word
document. See the earlier section, “Customizing
Blank Documents,” for details on how to use the
Modify Style dialog box. See Technique 21 for
details about creating new styles.

Technique 16: Changing Your Normal Template
112
To understand what information gets removed,
choose File➪Properties➪Summary (see Figure 16-7).
This particular setting (that I describe in the follow-
ing procedure) removes the Author, Manager, and
Company information from this dialog box, plus the
Last Saved By information on the Statistics tab.
• Figure 16-7: These fields are blanked out when you
choose the first privacy setting.
The second privacy setting removes a randomly
generated number that can be used to trace e-mail
messages back to the PC that originated them. For
example, if you send a document to a friend and that
friend sends the document to another person who
sends it to your boss, your boss can determine

Scary stuff. Here’s how to fix it:

When you’re done, either click the Save icon or
choose File➪Close, give the new template a
name, and then click Save.
The next time that you create a new document
with File➪New➪On My Computer, your template
will be among the choices.
Making Privacy Settings Stick
Word has two key personal privacy settings that as
far as I know, can be set permanently only if you set
them in the template. If you want to make them stick
for all new blank documents, you have to reach into
normal.dot and change the settings there.
The first privacy setting removes a small subset of
personal information from inside a Word document.
Word stores a vast array of potentially embar-
rassing private information inside documents —
your name, the location of the file, and even
(in some cases) a log of people who have
edited the document. Anyone with a bit of
time on his hands can go through and find it.
This privacy setting does not remove all the
personal information from a file. See
Technique 69 for important details.

If you e-mail a document out for revisions and
the revisions come back, when you open the

at all!

While you’re here, consider selecting the

have tracked changes in this document, so make
sure that you aren’t sending out anything sensi-
tive.” Your mileage may vary.

Setting Formatting for Drawings
One of the enduring problems with using the
Drawing toolbar is the default AutoShape format.
Every new AutoShape — whether it’s a line or a rec-
tangle or a callout — has a white fill and a solid
black 0.75-point line.
I hate white fill and a solid black 0.75-point line. In
about 99 percent of all the situations that I encounter
where I need to use Word’s Drawing toolbar, it’s the
worst possible setting. If I’m creating a line, the
default is too thin to show up, and it lacks an arrow-
head. If I’m working on a callout, I don’t want the
white fill to obliterate text underneath. If I’m drawing
a rectangle, I get both problems at the same time!
Blech, blech, and blech.

Technique 16: Changing Your Normal Template
114
• Figure 16-9: Start by drawing a simple AutoShape callout.
If you get a drawing canvas, review my dia-
tribe in Technique 11 and follow the steps
there to get rid of the blasted beast. When
you’ve knocked some sense into Word, come
back to Step 6 and try again. It isn’t absolutely
necessary — you can set the default here with-
out zapping the drawing canvas — but this is
as good a time to get rid of it as any.
7.
Right-click the callout and choose Format
AutoShape.
You get the Format AutoShape dialog box, as
shown in Figure 16-10.
8.
Choose the settings that you use the most often
so that you never have to reset the default
again.
I prefer No Fill so that the AutoShape is transpar-
ent, with a solid red line at a width (Weight) of 
1 pt (point), and a Begin Style arrow. (Play with it
a bit and find a combination that you like.) When
you’re done, click OK.
You can change the formatting on an individual
drawing (right-click and choose Format AutoShape),
and then set up a document so all future AutoShapes
will take on that formatting (right-click a drawing
and choose Set AutoShape Defaults). But there’s no
way to change the default for all new AutoShapes in
all new documents — at least, that’s what I thought
until a few months ago. The trick? Make the change
to normal.dot so that all new blank documents take
on the AutoShape defaults that you specify:
1.
Make sure that Windows shows hidden folders.
Choose Start➪My Documents, and then choose
Tools➪Folder Options➪View. Under Hidden Files
and Folders, click Show Hidden Files and Folders,
and then click OK.
2.
Start Word. Choose File➪Open. In the Files of
Type box, choose Document Templates.
3.
In the Look In box, navigate to 
C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>\
Application Data\Microsoft\Templates.
The Open dialog box should look like Figure 16-2.
4.
Double-click Normal.dot.
Word opens normal.dot.
5.
Either click the Drawing icon on the Standard
toolbar or right-click an empty spot on any tool-
bar and mark the Drawing check box.
Either way, the Drawing toolbar appears.
6.
Choose AutoShapes➪Callouts on the Drawing
toolbar, and pick one of the Line Callouts in the
second, third, four or fifth rows. Then click and
drag on normal.dot to create a callout.
normal.dot should look like Figure 16-9.
I have you work with a callout because it’s one
of the few shapes that have fill, line, and arrow
settings.

• Figure 16-10: Set your AutoShape defaults here.
9.
Back in normal.dot, right-click the callout and
choose Set AutoShape Defaults.
With AutoShape defaults set, Word will use the
formatting that you choose for all new
AutoShapes in all new blank documents.
10.
Important! Select the callout and delete it.
If you don’t delete the callout, every new blank
document will contain a callout just like it!
11.
Close normal.dot. Save changes if asked.
That is something I’ve been trying to do for many
years.

bar to make quick sketches, callouts, arrows, and
the like in Word documents. (Actually, on top of

Technique
Laying Out a 
Page — Quickly
M
ost people catch on to the Word basics pretty quickly — at least,
after the intrusive IntelliNONsense settings get axed (see
Techniques 15 and 16). You know that you need to select text
before applying formatting; you can click and drag to move stuff around;
you can put pictures in a document by choosing Insert➪Picture. Indents
and bullets and centering and color. All easy stuff.
The first major stumbling block that most Word users encounter comes
when they have to lay out text in an unfamiliar way. Perhaps you need a
form where people fill in their name and address — and you can’t get the
lousy columns to line up. Maybe you’re working on a résumé where the
dates go on the left and the activities on the right, and it’s a hemorrhoid
trying to keep them in sync.
My personal trial by fire, many years ago, was a newsletter. The content
was easy; in fact, other members of the club wrote most of the text. But
the layout! Oy! I spent hours every month getting the columns to line up
and keeping the headings in order. Adding a picture or a pull quote was
worse than pulling teeth.
It took years, but I finally figured out that I was trying to make Word work
the way I thought it should — and that I was doomed to failure. It’s as if 
I decided that my Segway should swim, and no number of calamitous
splashes would sway my determination.
If you need to lay out a page, follow this Technique and save yourself
days of heartache.
Seeing Word’s Way
Word has no problem at all dealing with plain-vanilla reports, memos, let-
ters, and the like. You can right-justify paragraphs or insert a picture and
have the text wrap around in a snap (see Technique 24).

Seeing Word’s Way
117
When you go beyond standard formatting, Word has
four tools that do the heavy lifting. Each tool works
well with a certain class of formatting problems —
and doesn’t work worth squat solving others. Your
first job, when confronted with a nonstandard for-
matting problem, is to find the right tool for the job:

Tabs and tab stops: These work well for creating
fill-in-the-blanks forms (see Figure 17-1) or in any
other situation where you need blank, under-
lined lines ( _______ ) between aligned columns
of text.
• Figure 17-1: Fill-in-the-blanks forms work best with tabs.
My advice: If you want to print underscores
_____ or dots ..... and you need to line up the
text around them, use tabs.

Tables: These critters are great for keeping
columns of text in sync. You might want to use
tables for a résumé (see Figure 17-2), a parts
catalog, or a list of consultants with their 
qualifications.
• Figure 17-2: Tables make it easy to keep text lined up
left-to-right.
My advice: If you need to line up text or
graphics and you aren’t sure what to use, try
tables first.

Snaking columns: These are like the ones in a
newspaper, but they aren’t used very often by
those in the know . . . although you’ll see them
mentioned many places online and in Word help.
Snaking columns work when you have a fairly
long list of items that you want to appear in
columns on a page (see Figure 17-3), and the list
will fit on one page. Microsoft calls these news-
letter columns, but using them for newsletters is
an invitation to disaster. See the sidebar,
“Creating Newsletters,” elsewhere in this
Technique.
• Figure 17-3: Snaking columns work well in a very limited
set of circumstances.
My advice: If you think that snaking columns
will solve your problem, they probably won’t.
Look at linked text boxes, which probably do
everything that you need to do with much less
headache. I explain how to use linked text
boxes later in this Technique.

Technique 17: Laying Out a Page — Quickly
118
If you’ve ever tried to get a form to line up by
typing underlines and spaces, using the
methodical approach in the following steps not
only gives you a much better-looking form,
but it’ll do so in record time. Guaranteed.
Here’s how to make a form quickly and accurately,
the first time:
Creating a fill-in-the-blanks form is almost
impossible unless you have Word show you
paragraph marks and Tab characters. Follow
the instructions in Technique 15 to have Word
display these two crucial characters. Someday,
you’ll thank me for that.
1.
Open (or create) the document that you want to
contain the form. Put your cursor wherever
you want the form to appear, pressing Enter
once for each line in your form. Then give
yourself a little extra breathing room by press-
ing Enter a couple more times.
The form in Figure 17-1 is really only four lines
long. But because I want to leave a couple of
extra clean paragraph marks in the document
(following the form), I press Enter a total of six
times.
When creating a fill-in-the-blanks form, you
want one separate paragraph for each line.
That’s because Word stores the tab stop infor-
mation (along with all other paragraph format-
ting) inside the paragraph mark. When you
set tab stops, if there’s one line per paragraph,
keeping track of what you’re doing is easy. If
you have more than one line in a paragraph,
the situation turns very messy, very quickly.
2.
Determine exactly where each line and each
piece of text will begin on the first line of the
form.

Text boxes: These are AutoShapes that you draw
and then fill with text. You can even link text
boxes so that if you put too much text in a box, it
overflows into the next box. Text boxes are infi-
nitely superior to snaking columns in almost all
cases.
You’d think that with all the advanced capabili-
ties of Word, you could use it to put together a
quality newsletter. The reality is that you run
into little problems here and there that require
you to tinker with the settings, and the process
turns into a real time sink. I hate to admit it,
but if you have a copy of Microsoft Publisher,
it’s much, much easier to build a good printed
newsletter in Publisher than in Word. If you
need real newsletter-publishing capabilities
(such as the ability to balance columns easily, a
feature to extend Page 1 text onto back pages,
and a way to generate a Table of Contents
without pulling out your hair) get a program
designed for the purpose instead. If your situa-
tion does require that you create a newsletter
in Word, linked text boxes, which I discuss
later in this Technique, are your best bet.
Laying Out Forms with Tabs
If you’re working with a monospace font — one like
Courier, where all the characters are the same
width — it’s easy to line up text so that all the
columns start in the same location. Just type like
you would on a typewriter, count the characters, and
it all lines up. No sweat. But the minute you go
beyond Courier, you’ve got problems. Big time.
The good news is that you don’t need to revert to
Courier and conjure up bad memories of correction
tape or (even worse) count characters in the hope of
finding a magic formula that will make the text line
up (you won’t find one).

Laying Out Forms with Tabs
119
You can use a pencil. Measure from the left edge
of the text. In Figure 17-1, I decide to start the
first underline at 0.75 inches from the left edge of
the text, put Last Name at three inches from the
left edge of the text, and the final underscore
goes all the way out to five inches.
3.
Click the first line of your form and then
choose Format➪Tabs.
Word shows you the Tabs dialog box for the first
paragraph — which is to say, the first line — of
your form (see Figure 17-4).
• Figure 17-4: Set the tab stops for the first line of the form.
The so-called Bar tab stop alignment (see
Figure 17-4) is a useless and confusing throw-
back to the days of Word 1.0. Don’t touch it.
4.
In the Tab Stop Position box, type the location
of the first tab stop on the line.
In the sample form in Figure 17-1, the first tab
stop appears where the underline starts, which
is at 0.75 inches.
5.
Choose an alignment for the tab stop.
All the tab stops in the sample form are left-
aligned. Word has four usable tab stop align-
ments (see Figure 17-5):
 Left means that any text after the Tab charac-
ter starts immediately after the tab stop.
 Right means that any text after the Tab char-
acter gets right-aligned at the tab stop.
 Center means that any text after the Tab char-
acter gets centered at the location of the tab
stop.
 Decimal means that Word puts the first deci-
mal point (period) following the Tab character
at the tab stop location and arranges the
other text around the decimal point.
• Figure 17-5: Tab characters and tab stops interact in pre-
dictable (but sometimes hard to visualize) ways.
6.
Choose a leader for the tab stop.
The leader (pronounced lee-der) is the character
that Word uses to fill in blank sections on the
line. For a fill-in-the-blanks form, you frequently
use the underline leader.
If you don’t like the underline styles in the Tabs
dialog box, you can create a more customized
line instead. Select None in the Leader area,
select the Tab character in your document
(remember to have character marks showing),
and then choose Format➪Font to select from the
wider array of underline styles in the Font dialog
box instead.

Technique 17: Laying Out a Page — Quickly
120
7.
Click the Set button to set the tab stop.
8.
Repeat Steps 4–7 to set all the tab stops on the
line. When you’re done with the line, click OK.
The first line of the form in Figure 17-1 relies on
the tab stops shown in Table 17-1.
It’s very easy to replicate tab stops that you’ve
already set in the Tabs dialog box. To do so,
just copy a paragraph mark with the tabs that
you want to a new location. Or press Enter
while the cursor is inside a paragraph with cus-
tom tab stops that you created, and the new
paragraph will inherit the tab stops. This quick
and easy method is possible because the tab
stops are stored in the paragraph mark.
Remember to make character marks visible, or
this trick can become very confusing.
9.
Repeat Steps 3–8 for each line of your form.
Table 17-1 also shows you the tab stops for 
the second, third, and final lines of the form in
Figure 17-1.

Default Tab Stops in Word
If you’ve ever typed Tab characters in a document, you’ve
no doubt noticed that Word has tab stops already set up:
The text that you type jumps to the next tab stop, even if
you’ve never created a custom stop. Word starts out with
default tab stops, left-aligned, set every half inch. When you
set your own tab stops, the default ones don’t disappear
completely. They linger after the last tab stop that you set.
So if you set tab stops at 3 and 4.75 inches in a particular
paragraph, you’ll find tabs stops at 3 and 4.75 inches just as
you’d expect. But you’ll also find that the default, left-
aligned tab stops still exist at 5 inches, 5.5 inches, 6 inches,
and so on, to the end of the paper.
Aligning Text with Tables
If you think of Word tables as being just like little
Excel spreadsheets without most of the calculating
capabilities — or as a neat way to draw horizontal
and vertical boxes in a document — you might be
missing an important point.
Tables rate as one of the premiere ways to align text
on a page. The minute that you need to put text on
the left and text on the right — and have the two
pieces of text line up — you should think tables.
Figure 17-2 illustrates a classic use for tables: to
build a résumé. A typical résumé has headings on
the left side and detailed text on the right. You want
the headings to line up with the details, and it’s mur-
derous keeping the two synchronized if you don’t use
tables.
To set up a document with two synchronized
columns of text
1.
Create or open the document that you want to
lay out.
2.
Press Enter five or six times.
It always helps to have some extra, unused para-
graph marks hanging around when you’re work-
ing with tables.

Aligning Text with Tables
121
3.
Click where you want the table to appear and
then choose Table➪Insert➪Table.
Word brings up the Insert Table dialog box 
(see Figure 17-6).
• Figure 17-6: Put a table in your document the fast way.
4.
Type 2 in the Number of Columns box, type 2 in
the Number of Rows box, and then click OK.
Word draws a two-column table in your docu-
ment (see the results in Figure 17-7).
• Figure 17-7: Start with a standard, everyday two-column
table.
5.
If you want a narrower column on the left than
on the right, click the vertical line in the mid-
dle of the table and drag it to the left.
Don’t worry too much about aligning things pre-
cisely. It’s always easy to move the middle line.
6.
Get rid of the border lines on the table cells.
First, select the table. (The fastest way is to
click the four-headed arrow at the upper left
of the table, but you can also choose Table➪
Select➪Table.) Then choose Format➪Borders
and Shading➪Borders.
Word shows you the Borders and Shading dialog
box for the table (as shown in Figure 17-8).
• Figure 17-8: Take the lines off the table cells.
7.
In the upper-left corner, click None. 
Then click OK.
Word removes the borders from the table cells.
If you don’t see gray lines around each table
cell, choose Table➪Show Gridlines, and they
will appear onscreen. These gridlines are only
there to help you visually; they don’t print on
the final document. If they bug you, turn them
off (Table➪Hide Gridlines), but I generally
leave them there while I’m filling out the table.

Technique 17: Laying Out a Page — Quickly
122
8.
Fill in the table and watch how it all lines up
neatly. 
Add content to the columns as you would nor-
mally. You can type text, insert pictures, create
bulleted lists . . . just about anything that you
would normally do in a document.
Here are some tips for working with tables:

To jump to the next cell in the table, press Tab.

If you press Tab when you’re in the last cell in
the table, Word creates a new row.

Working with tab stops and Tab characters
inside a table cell can get claustrophobic, but if
you need to type a Tab character, you have to
hold down the Ctrl key: Ctrl+Tab puts a tab in the
document.

Because Word needs a paragraph mark outside
the table to keep track of section and document
formatting, you can’t delete the final paragraph
mark in a document if it’s preceded by a table. If
the lingering paragraph mark causes you grief —
for example, if it causes Word to add an extra
page to your document — remember that you
can format the paragraph mark so it’s hidden.
Just select the paragraph mark and choose
Format➪Font, select the Hidden check box, and
then click OK.
Creating Newsletters
Some people use Word for newsletters, but because you
have to spend a lot of time tinkering with settings, creating
a newsletter in Word becomes time-consuming if you cre-
ate newsletters on an ongoing basis. Here are some of 
the major pitfalls you’ll run into when using the format-
ting options that I discuss in this Technique to create
newsletters:
Tables: There are plenty of pros and cons, but the biggest
problem that I’ve encountered is with the table cells shrink-
ing or expanding when a little bit of text is added or
deleted, throwing the entire layout out of kilter. (If you set
the cells to stay exactly at a specific size, it’s even worse
than letting them shrink and expand because text gets
chopped off, or big gaps develop.)
Snaking columns: Microsoft recommends, repeatedly,
that you use snaking columns for newsletters. I take this as
conclusive proof that the people inside Microsoft who write
these things never use their own product. Snaking columns
might be useful if your entire newsletter consists of one arti-
cle that flows continuously from the first page to the last.
But snaking columns don’t work at all if you have different
elements in the newsletter. They’re impossible to balance
and deucedly difficult to keep from flip-flopping from page
to page, destroying any formatting that you’ve attempted
to enforce. This way lies madness.
Linked text boxes: In my experience, the hardest part of
setting up linked text box newsletters lies in the process of
physically getting the text boxes on the page: where they
go, how wide the margins run, and whether to nudge this
column here or that graphic there. You can’t just paint a
couple of text boxes on a page and rely on Draw➪Align or
Distribute to lay out the page. It takes an enormous amount
of time to do a good job — and even a lousy job ain’t no
walk in the park. If you do have to use Word to create a
newsletter, however, linked text boxes are the way to go.
Cramming Lists with 
Snaking Columns
I strongly recommend that you avoid snaking news-
paper-like columns (Microsoft’s Help calls them
newsletter-style columns) in all instances save one:
when you need to cram a list of items together, and
that list will fit on a single page. See a good example
of the type of list that I’m talking about in Figure 17-3.
I’ve also seen columns used to fit outlines and other
lengthy lists onto a single page.
Why?

You have very little control over where and how
the columns will break. Performing edits on a
document with snaking columns is like trying to
pet a hungry moray eel.

You can’t continue text from one place to
another. The text takes up all the space that it
wants, and you can do very little about it.

Cramming Lists with Snaking Columns
123

You can get truly bizarre and buggy behavior if
a snaking list flops over a page break (see break
types in Figure 17-9).

Snaking columns rely on section breaks. You
can see the section breaks themselves only if you
work in Normal view. However, you can see the
effect of the section breaks only in Print Layout
view (or in Print Preview, if you can stand the
wait). Flipping back and forth between the views
will leave you screaming for mercy.
• Figure 17-9: The seven snaking columns on the first page
produce only six columns on the second
page. Go figger.
If there’s any chance that your snaking list will
bump over a page break, take the time to turn
it into a table.
To lay out a list with snaking columns within a larger
document, follow these instructions precisely:
1.
Start with a clean, new Word document. Even if
you have all the stuff typed and ready for for-
matting, start with a clean, new Word document.
If you start with a document that isn’t pristine —
say, one with headers and footers — a million
things can go wrong when you insert snaking
columns.
2.
Choose View➪Normal.
Start in Normal view so that you can see the
section breaks.
3.
Press Enter a dozen times.
4.
Click near the top of the document — around
the third or fourth paragraph mark — and
choose Insert➪Break.
Word responds with the Break dialog box 
(see Figure 17-10).
• Figure 17-10: You need a section break to tell Word that
you want to change the number of columns
in the text.
5.
Under Section Break Types, select the
Continuous radio button and then click OK.
Word puts a Section Break (Continuous) — those
are Word’s parentheses and not mine — in your
document at the beginning of the area that you
will use for snaking columns.
6.
Click farther down in the document — say,
after a few more paragraph marks — and
choose Insert➪Break. Under Section Break
Types, select the Continuous radio button and
then click OK.
You now have two section breaks in your docu-
ment, with a handful of paragraph marks to work
with in between (see Figure 17-11).

Technique 17: Laying Out a Page — Quickly
124
• Figure 17-13: Set the number of columns between the
two section breaks here.
10.
In the Number of Columns box, type the num-
ber of columns that you want (or choose from
one of the preset options at the top) and then
click OK.
Word immediately flips into Page view and shows
you the columns (see Figure 17-14).
• Figure 17-14: Word switches to Page view so you can see
the columns.
Note the section break mark immediately
before the first item in the snaking list. Don’t
delete it! If you do, all of the earlier material in
the document will start snaking, too.
11.
To be safe, choose View➪Normal.
• Figure 17-11: The staging area for snaking columns is
between the section breaks.
7.
Between the two section breaks, copy (or type)
all the stuff that you want to appear laid out
with snaking columns.
In Figure 17-12, I copy in the list of filename
extensions that I want to snake.
• Figure 17-12: Bring in the list that you want to format
with snaking columns.
8.
Click once somewhere between the two section
breaks.
9.
Choose Format➪Columns.
Word brings up the Columns dialog box (see
Figure 17-13).

Linking Text with Text Boxes
125
Don’t edit the document in Page view because
it’s very easy to move, copy, or delete the sec-
tion breaks. Stay in Normal view (refer to
Figure 17-12) to complete your edits. Switch
back to Page view only to see the ungodly
mess that you’ve created.
Linking Text with Text Boxes
Anytime you want to arrange text in a complex way,
where text can flow from one part of your document
to another, you should immediately think of linked
text boxes. Snaking columns are unwieldy. Tables
work well if the format is regimented — stuff on the
left aligned with stuff on the right (or even possibly
stuff in the middle). But if you want to flow text
through a document, as you would with a newsletter
or a flyer or some kinds of reports, linked text boxes
hold the key.
Are you trying to build an electronic news-
letter? That’s a horse of a different color. See
Technique 61 for details. This section deals
only with printed newsletters.
On the surface, linked text boxes sound simple:
1.
Bring up the Drawing toolbar. Disable the drawing
canvas (more on this monster in Technique 11).
2.
Carefully draw text boxes where you want text to
appear.
3.
Construct links among the text boxes, thereby
telling Word where to put text when it gets too
big for the first text box.
4.
Put sentences that read Continued on page XXX
at the bottom of the text boxes that overflow.
As is so often the case with Word, the devil’s in the
details.
Here’s the general approach that I recommend:

Use the following steps to see how linked text
boxes work.

Don’t try to build your own newsletter. Instead,
take one from Office Online and adapt it to your
needs. To look through the Office Online news-
letter templates, type newsletter templates in
the Help box in the upper-right corner of the
Word screen, press Enter, and download a few.
To create linked text boxes:
1.
Review Technique 11 to discover how to turn
off the drawing canvas and how to use the
Drawing toolbar.
2.
Click the Text Box icon on the Drawing toolbar.
3.
Click and drag on your document (actually, in
the drawing layer of your document) to create
a text box.
The box should look like Figure 17-15.
• Figure 17-15: Draw a text box first.
4.
Click the Text Box icon again, click and 
drag again, and create a second text box 
(see Figure 17-16).

Technique 17: Laying Out a Page — Quickly
126
The excess flows into the second text box 
(see the magic in Figure 17-17).
To insert text that reads Continued on page
XXX at the bottom of a text box, I suggest
that you use another text box. Draw it at the
bottom of the second text box. Doing so
keeps the Continued on page XXX text from
spilling over into the linked text box if you
should edit the contents of the linked boxes.
• Figure 17-17: Anything that doesn’t fit inside the first text
box flows into the second.
Word’s newsletter support is rudimentary at best,
but you can always do better than struggle with
snaking newspaper-like columns.
• Figure 17-16: The second text box will be linked to 
the first.
5.
Right-click the outer rim of the first text box
and choose Create Text Box Link.
The mouse pointer turns into a pitcher (!) with
letters pouring out of the spout.
6.
Click once inside the second text box.
The two text boxes are now linked. Any text put
in the first box that won’t fit will flow to the sec-
ond box.
7.
Try it. Type (or copy) a few long paragraphs
into the first text box.

Making Professional
Labels
A
ll businesses (and most individuals!) use mailing labels. Printing
simple, ugly, text-only labels takes a minimal amount of effort. You
can do it in your sleep.
If good-looking labels are important to you, this Technique is for you.
I explain how to set up very professional, high-quality labels in an hour
or less. And you’ll be able to reuse the labels over and over again.
You don’t need to spend big bucks at the print shop. If your address
changes, you don’t need to throw away stacks of old labels. If you want
to put a special tag line on Via Airmail or New Price List! labels, you don’t
need to run out and buy a rubber stamp. All it takes is a little foresight
and a few quick clicks. See my handiwork in Figure 18-1.
• Figure 18-1: Use Word to make your own customized and professional labels.

Technique 18: Making Professional Labels
128
• Figure 18-2: Preparing to print a single label.
• Figure 18-3: Word has an enormous list of manufacturers’
labels.
4.
Choose whether you want an entire sheet of
labels to be printed that use the same address
or whether you want just one label.
Laser printer manufacturers generally recom-
mend that you not print single labels; rather,
they want you to run them through a sheet at
a time and not try to reuse the sheet. Why? A
label that gets dislodged inside the printer’s
fuser can turn to gooey toast faster than you
can say, “Where the %$#@! is the fire extin-
guisher?” Ink jet and dot matrix printers don’t
have the same, uh, sense of urgency.
Creating and Printing 
Simple Labels
This section covers the typical approach for small,
text-only labels — the Avery 5160 (see Figure 18-2)
being a prime example. If you don’t have enough
room on the label for anything but the recipient’s
address, you’re rather limited in appearances, but
Word’s built-in label printing capabilities can save
you time.
If fancier labels are what you’re looking for and you
don’t mind copying addresses into your labels manu-
ally (or you’re setting up a full-scale merge to print
labels for a whole bunch of people), spring for larger
labels and follow the quick steps in the following
sections in this Technique. Your mailings will look
infinitely better.
Printing single mailing labels — or a sheet of identi-
cal mailing labels — is a snap:
1.
If the name and address that you want to
appear on the mailing label is already in your
document, select it.
Word does a good job of grabbing addresses
from the document, but you can make sure the
mailing labeler gets precisely what you want if
you select it first.
2.
Choose Tools➪Letters and Mailings➪
Envelopes and Labels➪Labels.
You see the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, as
shown in Figure 18-2.
3.
If the correct label isn’t showing in the lower-
right corner, or if you’ve never used the Label
feature before, click the Options button, pick
the label (see Figure 18-3), and make adjust-
ments to the printer setup if need be.
You can design your own labels and type in cus-
tom dimensions (use the New Label button in
Figure 18-3), but chances are very good that
Microsoft already has your label size nailed.

Customizing a Template for Fancy Labels
129
5.
Put a sheet of labels in your printer.
Do it now because when you click Print, Word
prints. Immediately.
6.
Click Print.
The label(s) come out the back.
Customizing a Template 
for Fancy Labels
Adding graphics, a return address, or even a tag line
or slogan to a mailing label is easy. Unfortunately,
you can’t use a customized label with Microsoft’s
automatic label program, so you lose some of the
features that I describe in the preceding section. In
particular, you can’t bring in a name and address
directly from your Outlook Contacts list.
You can perform a mail merge to create mas-
sive numbers of mailing labels. When merg-
ing, you can start with the built-in labels that
ship with Word (the text-only kind), or you can
start with your own custom-designed labels.
The trick to using your own custom labels is to
tell Word that you want to merge to a Directory
in the first step of the Mail Merge Wizard.
This same procedure works well for printing
business cards; disk, CD, or video tape labels;
file folder labels; small wedding invitations or
birth announcements; name badges; index
cards; postcards; Rolodex cards; or in any
other situation where you print the same stuff
multiple times on a single sheet, and Word has
a label size entry that matches the dimensions
of what you’re printing. (Word appears to
include all the labels from AOne, APLI, Avery,
Devauzet, ERO, Formtec, HERMA, Hisago,
Kokuyo, MACO, PIMACO, Xerox, and
Zwekcform — and that covers a lot of ground!)
If your needs for fancy labels don’t stray too
far from the straight and narrow — or if you’re
looking for label layout ideas — take a gander at
the Avery Wizard and templates at www.avery.
com/us/software/index.jsp.
The best and fastest way that I know to set up fancy
labels so they’re reusable involves using Word’s
Label routine to create a template and then using the
template to print the labels. This section explains
how to set up the template, and “Filling In and
Printing Labels from a Template” later in this
Technique explains how to put the template to use.
Here’s how to set up a template, based on the Avery
5164, a 3.3-inch (high) x 4-inch (wide) label that I’ve
used for many years:
1.
Choose Tools➪Letters and Mailings➪
Envelopes and Labels➪Labels.
Word brings up the Envelopes and Labels dialog
box, as shown in Figure 18-4.
• Figure 18-4: Start with Word’s Label routine.
2.
If there’s any text in the Address box, delete it.
3.
Click the Options button (refer to the resulting
dialog box in Figure 18-3) and pick the label
that best matches the size of what you will be
printing. If you want to see the full layout
description, click the Details button. When you
find the right one, click it and then click OK.

Technique 18: Making Professional Labels
130
• Figure 18-6: Get the first label the way you want it.
If you put a paragraph mark (that is, press
Enter) immediately in front of the end-of-cell
marker (the circle with lines emanating from
it), select the paragraph mark and apply some
sort of distinctive formatting. (I use Garamond
14-point bold in Figure 18-6.) Now making the
recipient’s address look distinctive when you
print the label is easy. See details in the follow-
ing section.
Good graphics make all the difference. Try
searching the Web for pictures with Google’s
Image Lookup (www.google.com/imghp). Also,
see the section, “Micro-Adjusting Pictures,”
later in this Technique for advice on getting
pictures lined up the right way.
6.
When the first label (which is to say, the first
cell of the table) looks right, select everything
in the label and copy it.
Also — if one exists — select the end-of-cell
marker in the small (blank) cell to the right of the
first cell (see Figure 18-7). That ensures that you
pick up the graphic and everything else in the
cell.
Don’t get hung up on the descriptions — a
Shipping Label works just as well as an Address
Label or a Postcard. You’re just looking for a
match on the size and how the labels are aligned
on a page.
If you want to print announcements or invita-
tions, take a look at the Avery 3263, 3611,
5389, or 5824.
4.
Back in the Envelopes and Labels dialog box,
click the New Document button.
Word creates a one-page document that consists
of a table (see Figure 18-5). That table contains
cells, one for each of the labels on the sheet.
• Figure 18-5: Word quickly and accurately creates a table
in which each cell corresponds precisely to
one label on the page.
5.
Put together the first label. Add graphics, your
return address, slogan — whatever strikes your
fancy.
My fancy struck Figure 18-6.

Customizing a Template for Fancy Labels
131
• Figure 18-7: Select everything in the first cell. You might
need to select the second end-of-cell marker,
too.
7.
Click once inside each label, in turn, and paste.
You have a full sheet of labels (see Figure 18-8).
• Figure 18-8: Paste the graphics and text into each label.
8.
Click immediately in front of the paragraph
mark at the end of the first label. (That’s where
you want to paste the recipient’s address for
the first label.) Choose Insert➪Bookmark and
then type a name for the bookmark. (I use R1C1
to stand for row 1, column 1 in Figure 18-9, but
you’re probably much more clever.) Then click
Add.
• Figure 18-9: Bookmark the addressee location for the
label in row 1, column 1.
Bookmarking the addressee location makes it
easy to navigate directly to the addressee loca-
tion for the label in row 1, column 1. When
you reuse the label setup, the bookmarks
come in handy.
9.
Similarly, put a bookmark where the addressee
goes for the label in row 1, column 2. Repeat
for each label in the document.
In this case, I create six bookmarks: R1C1, R1C2,
R2C1, R2C2, R3C1 and R3C2.
10.
Choose File➪Save. In the Save as Type box 
at the bottom, choose Document Template.
Give the label template a descriptive name 
(in Figure 18-10, I choose Label AV5164.dot)
and then click Save.

132
2.
Use the Zoom drop-down list on the Standard
toolbar and zoom the template for Whole Page.
This makes selecting entire columns and rows
easier.
3.
Select every row except the first and then press
Delete.
4.
Select every column except the first and then
press Delete.
All the text and graphics in the template 
are deleted except for the first label (see 
Figure 18-11).
• Figure 18-11: Delete everything except the first label.
5.
Choose File➪Save As and save the first label
with an easily recognized name.
For example, I save the template in Figure 18-11
as Label AV5164 R1C1.dot.
• Figure 18-10: Save the mailing label as a template.
If you save the label setup as a template, you
can reuse it every time you need to print
labels. See “Filling In and Printing Labels from
a Template” later in this Technique for details
on using the template.
You can make many different mailing label
templates. Just give each of them names that
you can recognize.
If you always print a full sheet of mailing labels at a
time, you’re done. On the other hand, if you want to
make it easy to print just one label at a time, I sug-
gest that you save a customized copy of the tem-
plate for each label — one template can be used to
print the label in the upper-left corner, the next for
the label to its right, and so on. That makes it easy
and fast to print each label on a page, one by one.
Here’s how:
1.
If the template from Step 10 in the preceding
procedure isn’t open, open it.
If you need to find it, make sure that Windows
shows you hidden folders (see Technique 1),
then look in C:\Documents and Settings\
<your user name>\Application Data\
Microsoft\Templates. Right-click the template
(don’t double-click it) and choose Open.

Filling In and Printing Labels from a Template
133
6.
Click the Undo icon on the Standard toolbar
twice.
That restores the template to its original state.
7.
Repeat Steps 3–5 for each label, saving each
one with a different name.
For example, in Figure 18-12, I save the label in
row 3, column 2 as Mailing Label 6-Up AV5164
R3C2.dot.
• Figure 18-12: Row 3, column 2 gets R3C2 in its name.
In the next section, I describe some shortcuts for
using this kind of label.
Filling In and Printing Labels
from a Template
If you follow the instructions in the preceding sec-
tion and create a template for fancy mailing labels,
here’s how to print one label:
Unfortunately, Microsoft hasn’t built any hooks
into the Tools➪Envelopes and Labels feature,
so you have to run your homegrown labels
manually. Surprisingly, though, the amount of
extra work involved is minimal.
1.
Copy the addressee’s name and address to the
Clipboard.
You can pick it up from a Word document, in
your Contacts list, on a Web page . . . doesn’t
matter.
2.
In Word, choose File➪New.
3.
If your mailing label template isn’t on the 
list of Recently Used Templates, click On My
Computer (it’s in the middle, underneath the
line Templates).
Word responds with the Templates dialog box
(see Figure 18-13).
• Figure 18-13: Your fancy mailing label template appears
on the General tab.
4.
Double-click the appropriate mailing label
template.
Word creates a new document based on the
template (see Figure 18-14).

Technique 18: Making Professional Labels
134
To print an entire sheet of labels, choose the
correct template in Step 4 and then repeat
Steps 5 and 6 to paste the names into each
label.
Micro-Adjusting Pictures
One weekend, while making a template like the one
described in “Creating Fancy Labels” earlier in this
Technique, Justin (my writing partner) and I discov-
ered a nifty little trick for adjusting pictures.
Putting a picture in a table cell is easy: Insert➪
Picture does the trick. You can click the picture and
adjust the drag handles to make the picture bigger
or smaller with no problem.
Getting the picture down to the bottom of the cell
is also easy. Choose Table➪Properties➪Cell; under
Vertical Alignment, pick Bottom; then click OK. But
I wanted the picture to hover just a bit above the
bottom of the label. I discovered the hard way that
printing a picture too close to the edge frequently
chops off the bottom.
You can adjust the paragraph space after set-
tings (choose Format➪Paragraph and then
increase the number in the After box, beneath
Spacing), but here’s a much faster, more visual
way. Use the Word Crop tool to add white
space at the bottom of the picture.
Most of the time, I think of the Crop tool as a means
for cutting off parts of a picture. But as Justin discov-
ered, it works just as well in reverse, adding white
space to a picture, too.
Here’s how to crop:
1.
Click once on the picture.
2.
If you can’t see the Picture toolbar (see 
Figure 18-15), right-click any blank part of a
toolbar and then mark the Picture check box.
• Figure 18-14: A new document based on Label AV5164
R1C2.
5.
Move to the place where you want to put the
name and address.
You can navigate there, choose Edit➪Go To, 
or press F5 twice to move to the appropriate
bookmark.
6.
Paste the name and address (refer to 
Figure 18-1 for the final result).
Click the Smart Tag, if need be, and choose
Match Destination Formatting to format the
copied address to match the formatting that you
applied to the paragraph mark inside the label.
7.
Print the label. Click the X in the upper-right
corner to close the document. No, you don’t
want to save changes.

• Figure 18-15: The Crop tool on the Picture toolbar.
3.
Click the Crop tool on the Picture toolbar.
4.
Click one of the picture’s drag handles.

I want to add space to the bottom of the picture,
so I click the dot in the middle of the picture, at
the bottom.
5.
Press Alt.
That keeps Word from “snapping” the cropping
point.
6.
Drag the bottom handle down to make the pic-
ture push itself up off the bottom of the cell.
That’s a very fast, very visual way to move a picture
off the baseline.

Technique
Editing Like a Pro
I
’ve been writing books for more than a decade now and have turned
out tens of thousands of printed pages. I’ve also written many hun-
dreds of magazine articles and thousands of newsletter articles. Along
the way, I’ve worked with hundreds of editors. Some of them even sur-
vived the experience. (Hey, Becky!)
Editing is a tough job. Writing is a tough job. But rolling edits into a docu-
ment can be an easy job — if everybody works the same way.
Twelve years ago, my first computer books were all hand-edited. I typed
the pages with Word, printed them out, bundled the printouts with a
floppy disk, and sent the whole thing via FedEx to the editorial team.
Each of the editors, one by one, would tackle the manuscript with a
different-colored pen. After I finished the last pass with a flourish of my
telltale red pen, I couriered the final marked-up pages back to the editors. 
I never did figure out what they did with the bloodstained sheets, but
my guess is that they retyped every single word in PageMaker.
Things are different now. Different . . . but I’m not at all sure they’re bet-
ter. Why? Because authors and editors don’t use Word’s tools properly.
If you edit pages, or if you have editors work on your pages, or even if
you edit your own pages, you can save hours and days of frustration —
and no small number of errors — if everyone involved will follow a few
simple rules. That’s what this Technique is about.
Editing in a SharePoint World
Everything begins and ends with doc files.
If you’re working on a big project, it’s most likely broken into a bunch of
smaller documents that are ultimately stitched together to make the final
publication.
Save Time By
 Convincing your editors
to make changes the

 Reviewing and accepting

Tracking Changes
137
Typically, the designated author takes a crack at cre-
ating a doc file. When the author’s satisfied (or just
tired of the whole mess), she passes on the doc file
to the number-one editor.
That editor tells Word to start tracking changes
(see the following section, “Tracking Changes”). 
(In effect, now whoever fiddles in your document
has her handiwork marked in a certain color as 
well as by a name identifier. Very handy for hunting
scoundrels.) The lead editor then passes the docu-
ment around to other editors and/or posts it to a
SharePoint Document Workspace.
A SharePoint Document Workspace holds
one in-progress copy of the document, together
with information about your co-workers, tasks,
scheduling, due dates, and the like. Everyone
on the team can get at the document through
a Web browser, frequently via an e-mailed
pointer to the document, which is updated
from the Workspace before you work on it.
You can imagine the significant version control
problems when more than one person is
working on the same document simultane-
ously, so coordinate what you’re doing — and
when you do it — with your teammates.
When the number-one editor is happy with the col-
lected modifications, he runs through them, accepts,
rejects, changes, or otherwise handles them, and
then sends a modified document back to the author.
When the author opens the document, she sees her
original submission that was pummeled by the
hands of a hundred ham-fisted editors. (Or, if she’s a
former editor, caressed by the caring observations
of a hundred adoring collaborators. I’m a former
editor. I know.)
The author’s job then is to make final changes,
answer any open questions, and send the last, best
version back to the number-one editor.
The number-one editor then makes a final run at the
changes — accepting, rejecting, or rewriting. He
stops tracking changes and sends the final copy off
to a production department or the printer.
The Track Changes features in Word 2002/
Office XP are so badly botched that you
should seriously consider upgrading to Word
2003 if you spend much time at all working
with tracked changes. Most of the bugs in
Word 2002 appear to be fixed in 2003. At
least Word 2003 lets you change formatting
for deleted text. (See www.woodyswatch.com/
office/archtemplate.asp?v7-n11 for
reams of problems with track changes in Word
2002.) Track Changes in Word 97, in particu-
lar, is loaded with bugs, too, and if your writ-
ing and editorial staff uses multiple versions of
Word, you can expect all sorts of odd behavior.
Give or take a mistake or three — say, forgetting to
turn on Track Changes at the right time — and that’s
how a hearty round of editing should work. In the
remainder of this Technique, I show you how to
make the process work faster, better, and more accu-
rately for author and editor alike.
Avoiding Master Documents
More advanced Word users have lost more time with
Master Documents than any other feature I know. Master
Documents is Microsoft’s smoke-’n-mirrors method of com-
bining smaller documents with hidden section breaks, pri-
marily via the Outline view, to make a big document that
can have a single Table of Contents and references
between chapters. Although Microsoft swears that Master
Documents finally work right in Word 2003, I remain
skeptical — and recommend that you avoid them.
Tracking Changes
There comes a point in every document’s life where
the author finishes with authoring (or, ahem, what-
ever authors do), and the focus shifts to editing (or,
well, you get the idea). That’s the point where some-
body — author, editor, bit basher in the sky — needs
to tell Word to start tracking changes.

Technique 19: Editing Like a Pro
138
2.
In most cases (see the sidebar, “Track Changes
Lockdown”), you want to lock the document so
that changes other people make to the docu-
ment are always tracked. If that applies, imme-
diately choose Tools➪Protect Document.
Word shows you the Protect Document task pane
on the right (see Figure 19-2).
• Figure 19-2: As soon as you track changes, make sure
that others can’t accidentally (or intentionally!)
make changes that aren’t tracked.
3.
Select the Allow Only This Type of Editing in
the Document check box. Then in the drop-
down list, choose Tracked Changes.
This effectively prevents other people from turn-
ing off tracked changes — either accidentally or
intentionally. That means that you can be reason-
ably sure that every change made to your origi-
nal prose will be tracked and noted by Word.
Before you start tracking changes, you (and all
the other folks who plan to make changes)
need to make sure that Word knows who you
are. Choose Tools➪Options➪User Information
and make sure that Word has your name. If
you bought your PC with Word pre-installed
or if somebody at the corporate office installed
it for you, chances are good that the name
looks like Satisfied Dell Customer or some
such. If you don’t change the name, Word’s
tracking doesn’t work right.
Yes, even if you edit your own work and
nobody ever touches it, as soon as you shift
from writing to editing, you need to have
Word start tracking changes. It can save you
hours of needless rewriting. By telling Word to
keep track of your changes, you can go back
and change your mind about a particular
phrase without disturbing the rest of your
work, copying from a day-old backup copy, or
clicking the Undo button precisely 113 times.
Turning on Track Changes
To tell Word that you want it to track changes
1.
Choose Tools➪Track Changes.
Equivalently, you can double-click the TRK but-
ton in the status bar at the bottom of Word’s
screen. See Figure 19-1.
The TRK box tells you that Track Changes is on.
• Figure 19-1: The TRK box.

Tracking Changes
139
Yes, bypassing this protection is relatively easy.
If somebody really, really wants to turn off
Track Changes, he can by copying the docu-
ment to a new document and giving it the
original document’s name; retyping the docu-
ment; or taking a screenshot and putting the
shot through an OCR scanning program. And
even though this isn’t heavy-duty security, it is
an effective way to keep all but the most
determined mitts off.
4.
Click the Yes, Start Enforcing Protection button.
Word asks you to enter an optional password 
in the Start Enforcing Protection dialog box 
(see Figure 19-3).
• Figure 19-3: You can password-protect tracked change
enforcement.
5.
Enter a password if you must, but if you do,
realize that you aren’t really protecting much.
Then click OK.
Word advises you that the document is pro-
tected and that changes will be tracked.
6.
Make a change or two to confirm that Track
Changes is in effect.
Track Changes Lockdown
When you track changes, most of the time you want to
make sure that changes other people make to the docu-
ment are always tracked. That’s why I recommend that you
lock the document: When other people make changes to
the document, the changes are always tracked. When you
lock the document, you can turn Track Changes on or off,
no problem: Just choose Tools➪Track Changes or double-
click the TRK button on the status bar. Being able to turn off
Track Changes comes in handy when you need to move a
big block of text, for example, or when you have to do
some complex juggling and you don’t want the details to
appear.
Working with Track Changes in Word 2003
Track Changes in Word 2003 is full of surprises,
although it’s considerably better behaved than the
feature in Word 2002/Office XP. Given a choice, expe-
rienced Word users frequently switch to Word 2000
or turn off the balloons (see “Reviewing and Finalizing
a Document” later in this Technique) to work with
tracked changes just because it’s so much simpler
and more stable.
When Word keeps track of changes, it can show
those changes to you in four different ways. First,
you can look at the original document as it looked
before any changes were made. (That’s also how the
document would look if you rejected all the
changes.) Word calls this Original.
Second, you can look at the Original document with
changes appearing off to the side. For example, if a
word was deleted by an editor, the word still appears
in the body of the document but with some sort of
indication — probably a strikethrough line — that
says the text was deleted. Text that’s inserted
appears in a balloon off to the side. Word calls this
Original Showing Markup.
Third, you can look at the final document with the
changes appearing off to the side. If a word was
deleted by an editor, that word does not appear in
the body of the document; rather, it’s hung off to the
side. Text that’s inserted does appear in the main
document. Word calls this Final Showing Markup.

Making Comments
Word makes it easy to put a Comment in a document;
just choose Insert➪Comment and type away. If you
work in Print Layout view, Comments usually appear
in balloons on the right edge of the onscreen page. If
you work in Normal view, Comments are highlighted
and noted with the commentator’s initials in line
with the text.
To see the Comments in Normal view, hover
your mouse over the Comment or show all
Comments at the bottom of the screen by
bringing up the Reviewing Toolbar (choose
View➪Markup), clicking the Show button, and
selecting Reviewing Pane.
To put a Comment in a Word 2003 document
1.
Select the text (or graphic) that you want to
make a comment about.
2.
Choose Insert➪Comment.
Word responds by putting colored brackets
around whatever you selected and setting up a
Comment balloon on the right edge of the page
(see Figure 19-5).
• Figure 19-5: By default, Word 2003 puts Comments in
balloons to the right of the text.
Fourth, you can look at the document as if all the
revisions had been accepted. Word calls this Final.
And so it is.
With the Revisions toolbar set at Final Showing
Markup and working in Print Layout view, here is
how edits look onscreen:

Deletions: These appear by default as balloons
on the right side.

New text: All inserted text is underlined.

All edits: Wherever changes occur, Word puts a
vertical bar in the left margin (see Figure 19-4).
• Figure 19-4: Tracked deletions appear in balloons;
additions appear underlined and in a
different color.
You can make the text in the balloon appear
bigger and adjust words such as Deleted,
which appears in Figure 19-4. See the section,
“Changing the Font of Tracked Changes and
Comments,” later in this Technique. 
Do the balloons drive you batty? Man, you
should see some of the documents that I work
on. They have more balloons on the edge
than text in the main part of the document!
You can get rid of the balloons by working in
the Normal view (choose View➪Normal), or
by choosing Tools➪Options➪Track Changes
and setting the Use Balloons (Print and Web
Layout) drop-down box to Never.

Changing the Font of Tracked Changes and Comments
141
3.
Type your Comment directly in the balloon.
Word puts your initials at the beginning. (The
initials are drawn from the User Information 
tab of Tools➪Options.)
If you hover your mouse pointer over the
Comment, Word shows you when the
Comment was last modified.
4.
When you’re done, click anywhere in the docu-
ment and keep going.
You can modify the font used in Comment balloons
by following the steps in “Changing the Font of
Tracked Changes and Comments,” coming up next.
Changing the Font of Tracked
Changes and Comments
In Word 2003, by default, tracked deleted text and
Comments appear in balloons to the right of the
text. Unfortunately, Word displays that text in an
eye-killing, Tahoma 8-point font, which has to be
the most ghastly choice of a working font in Office
history. Fortunately, you can change the font.
Unfortunately, it isn’t easy. Follow the rest of the
steps in this procedure to bring some relief to 
your eyes.
1.
Choose Format➪Styles and Formatting.
Word shows you the Styles and Formatting task
pane.
2.
At the bottom of the Styles and Formatting task
pane, in the Show box, choose Custom.
You see the Format Settings dialog box 
(see Figure 19-6).
3.
Select the Balloon Text and the Comment Text
check boxes (if they aren’t checked already)
and then click OK.
Balloon Text now appears in the Styles and
Formatting task pane.
• Figure 19-6: To set the font size for text in balloons, you
have to dig deep into Word’s built-in styles.
4.
Click the down arrow next to Balloon Text and
then choose Modify.
You see Word’s standard Modify Style dialog box
(see Figure 19-7).
5.
Choose Format➪Font. Change the font and then
click OK.
The point size here is the important part. (The
font itself is used only for the word Deleted
inside a tracked change balloon and the word
Comment inside Comments while Word is in Final
Showing Markup mode — it’s complicated and
buggy.) Personally, I use 11 point.
6.
Mark the Add to Template check box (so that
all future blank documents will inherit this
setting) and then click OK.

1.
Open a document with tracked changes and/
or Comments.
2.
Turn off change tracking by double-clicking the
TRK button down on the status bar (refer to
Figure 19-1).
3.
Choose View➪Markup.
Word brings up the Reviewing toolbar, set for
Final Showing Markup, which is the mode that
you usually use to review changes (see Figure
19-8).
• Figure 19-8: The Reviewing toolbar makes it easy to
review changes and Comments.
4.
Click the Next button on the Reviewing toolbar
to cycle through all the tracked changes and
Comments in the document.
The Next button is (confusingly) the second icon
on the Reviewing toolbar.
5.
If the ping-ponging back and forth between text
and balloons bugs you, click the Reviewing
pane icon to bring up a pane at the bottom of
the screen that contains the text of all
Comments and tracked changes.
The Reviewing pane icon is the last one on the
Reviewing toolbar. Click it to open the Reviewing
pane, as shown in Figure 19-9.
• Figure 19-9: Follow Comments and changes here.
Next

• Figure 19-7: Change the balloon text style.
7.
Repeat Steps 4–6 for Comment text.
Unlike the Balloon Text style, though, changing
the Comment text style’s font really does change
the font that’s used in the Comment balloon. 
I prefer Arial 11 point.
Reviewing and Finalizing 
a Document
The mechanics of running through Comments and
tracked changes is quite simple. In fact, in most
cases, Word identifies documents with changes as
you open them and sets everything up for you. In
case you want (or need) to do it by yourself, do the
following:

Using Editing Tools the Timesaving Way
143
If you find the balloons really distracting — and
many people do — you can get rid of them
completely by choosing Tools➪Options➪Track
Changes; then from the Use Balloons (Print
and Web Layout) drop-down list, choose
Never (see Figure 19-10). That puts all the doc-
ument’s changes in line with the text and
highlights Comments in Page Layout view —
making deletions, additions, and Comments
look the same in Page Layout view as they
always do in Normal view. 
• Figure 19-10: Turn off the balloons here. You can always
use the Reviewing pane at the bottom of
the screen.
6.
Accept or reject changes (or delete Comments),
one by one by clicking the appropriate icons.
Using Editing Tools the
Timesaving Way
Reviewing changes is the easy part. Here’s the hard
part — the part that can save you and your editors
hours, even days, of hard work.
When you have a query or you want to make
a comment, insert a Comment. When you
want the author (or editor) to make a change,
change the text directly.
Why?
The toughest problem that I have as an author (or
editor, or author/editor) is understanding precisely
what changes the editors want. The process that
bogs me down the most during edits is figuring out
how to change the text to accurately reflect the edi-
tors’ concerns.
If I can run through edits quickly, reading Comments
and making changes based on them, and accepting
(or, occasionally, rejecting) changes that have already
been composed, my work goes by in a flash. When
I’m done, I know that I have the editors’ changes
down cold.
But if I have to guess as to the wording that the edi-
tor(s) want(s), and bob and weave back and forth in
the text, it takes a lot of time — and I’m bound to
miss a few key points along the way.
In my experience, editors make their edits in one of
five ways. (Rarely does an editor use more than one
method in a single document.)

Change the document with Track Changes
turned off.
Editors who do that should be shot. Figuratively
anyway. Ultimately, though, it’s the author’s
responsibility to make sure Word is tracking

Technique 19: Editing Like a Pro
144
comment style’s font (see “Changing the Font of
Tracked Changes and Comments” earlier in this
Technique), Comments are very easy to see and
use. Word has tools for moving between
Comments easily. The only downside comes
when an editor uses a Comment balloon to sug-
gest specific changes in the text. In that case, if
the author agrees with the Comment, it’s a pain
in the neck to transfer the Comment to the text
itself — which is why editors should feel free to
change text directly.

Make changes directly.
I don’t know whether it’s a question of edit eti-
quette or a predilection for making a job much
harder and slower than it should be. But for
some reason, many editors have a hard time
simply going into the text and rewriting it. The
author might not agree with the changes, but
when you’re in the text, it’s easy to accept,
reject, or change whatever is on offer — and
there’s absolutely no question about where or
how or what the editor wants to change.
An editor’s prime directive and an author’s
furtive plea: If you have a comment, insert a
Comment. If you have a change, make the
change. Do that, and you make everyone’s job
easier, faster, and less error-prone.
In my opinion, that’s how you edit like a pro.
While I’m on the soapbox, I have two additional
requests:

If the change that you want to propose is highly
debatable and you don’t think that the author
will buy it, put it in a Comment with the pre-
cise wording that you would like to see in the
document.

If you have two alternative changes, make them
both in the document itself. That way, the author
can accept one or the other or meld the two
together in the final document.
Imagine the amount of time we could all save.
changes when the document leaves the author’s
hands. If you should receive a document with
untracked changes, use Word’s Compare
Documents feature (Tools➪Compare and Merge
Documents) to generate a document that resem-
bles one with track changes turned on. And
harangue the editor with profuse vituperations.
In my experience, you can’t rely on the
Compare Documents feature. Specifically, I
often get a document that shows the old ver-
sion completely deleted and the edited version
as all new text — not much help.

Apply highlighting to text he wants to change
or ask about and put the query or proposed
change somewhere else in the document.
This behavior, while common, saps so much time
for both the editor and the author that it should
be outlawed. Word has no features to help
authors nor editors look for highlighted text
(aside from searching for formatted text directly
with the Edit➪Find dialog box). When an author
encounters an edit of this nature, she has to
search for the comment or proposed change,
hop back and forth in the document between the
highlighted text and the changed text, and try to
merge the two in some way that makes sense. It’s
a time-killer of the first degree.

Make comments or propose changes in para-
graphs with special styles.
This is the most common way for editors in large
organizations to make edits. A handful of special
styles are set aside for various kinds of edits, and
each editor is expected to type his comments
and proposed changes in a paragraph with the
given style. The approach works, but things
could be so much more efficient — with
absolutely no additional effort on the editors’
part.

Insert Comments.
Word’s Insert➪Comment feature works like a
champ. Comments are automatically tied to the
text that pertains. As long as you change the

Finding and
Replacing in 
the Wild
O
ne of the first books I ever wrote (no, it wasn’t For Dummies!)
included a lengthy, detailed appendix covering various hardware
manufacturers, their products, and their snail mail contact
addresses. It took me weeks to compile all that information.
One of the editors decided that my use of the abbreviation Rd. in the
mailing addresses was too terse. Fair enough. The problem was that the
editor opened the appendix in Word and performed a global Search and
Replace, replacing every instance of rd with Road. Ooops. I didn’t catch
the gaffe until after the book was published. One reader wrote to me and
asked whether there was a difference between video boards and a video
boaRoads.
If you wield Search and Replace like a blunt instrument, you’re going to
smash something in the process. But if you understand the nuances —
and use the approaches I discuss in this Technique — Search and Replace
can perform the work of a hundred henchmen in the blink of an eye.
Streamlining Text Searches
You might have performed searches before, but you might not be aware of
some handy tools tucked into Word’s search features. Here’s one little trick
that will make finding simple text in your document go faster than ever:
1.
Bring up the Find and Replace dialog box (see Figure 20-1).
• Figure 20-1: Finding text starts here.

Technique 20: Finding and Replacing in the Wild
146
To perform fancier searches, click the More button in
the Find and Replace dialog box (refer to Figure 20-1).
This expands the dialog box to show Search Options
and formatting search criteria (see the upcoming
Figure 20-3). The Search Options are

Match Case: Searching for LaToya doesn’t find
Latoya or laToya.

Find Whole Words Only: Searching for gate
doesn’t find stargate or gates.

Use Wildcards: This is the source of enormous
confusion and lost time. See the following three
sections of this Technique for details.

Sounds Like (English): This is supposed to find
rhymes, but it doesn’t work worth beans.
Searching for time did not match lime or rhyme.

Find All Word Forms (English): This identifies
some noun plurals, verb tenses, and adjective
variations. Searching for good finds better and best.
With the dialog box expanded, you can also search
according to formatting criteria by clicking the
Format button; choose from font formatting such as
italic, a specific font, or even paragraph formatting
or styles. In Figure 20-3, I ran a search for the text
Dummies, with an initial capital D (by enabling the
Match Case check box), all in italic (from a choice
offered when I clicked the Format button).
• Figure 20-3: Refine your search to be more specific.
Of the many ways to make the Find and Replace
dialog box appear, the fastest is to press Ctrl+F.
You can also choose Edit➪Find. Or, click the
Select Browse Object dot (as in Figure 20-2) in
the lower-right corner of the screen and then
click the Find icon (looks like binoculars).
• Figure 20-2: The oddly named Select Browse Object dot
in the lower-right corner of the screen leads
to the Find icon.
If you can’t remember Ctrl+F for Find, con-
sider putting the Find icon on your Standard
toolbar. See Technique 13 for details.
2.
In the Find What box, type the text that you
want to find.
Note: Capitalization doesn’t matter in a standard
plain-text search. See how to refine this criterion
later in this section.
3.
Click the Find Next button.
4.
Here’s the trick. If anything was found, immedi-
ately click Cancel.
If you click Cancel right away, Word not only
takes the Find and Replace dialog box off the
document (it just gets in the way), but you can
repeat your search by clicking the down arrows
below Select Browse Object.
Search upward in the document by clicking
the up arrows above the Select Browse Object
is much faster and easier than doing the same
thing with the dialog box.

Searching for More Than Plain Text
147
If you search for formatting, be sure to click
the No Formatting button when you’re done
to turn off the formatting criterion. Word’s
search formatting settings are sticky: If you
search for bold characters and don’t turn off
the formatting, your next search is automati-
cally restricted to bold characters.
For details on finding special characters, see the fol-
lowing sections, “Searching for More Than Plain
Text” and “Matching Wildcards.”
To put the Find and Replace dialog box back to its
original svelte shape (hint: save screen real estate
while you search), click the Less button, which is a
toggle of More. I also recommend clicking Cancel the
minute you get a hit.
Searching for More 
Than Plain Text
If you’re just searching for text or formatting, the
steps in the preceding section will get you going in
no time. But frequently you want to look for more
than just text. In that case, you have two choices:

Run a fast and easy (but not very versatile)
search by using the Special button in the Search
and Replace dialog box (refer to Figure 20-3).
I talk about that kind of extended search in 
this section.

Run a wildcard search, where you can look for
patterns of characters or any of a wide array of
ancillary characters. I talk about that kind of
search in the next section.
Unfortunately, the two types of searches are
mutually exclusive. If you can’t find what you
want with the quick extended search
described in this section, you have to start all
over again, from scratch, with a wildcard
search.
When you click the Special button in the Find and
Replace dialog, Word gives you the ability to pick
individual characters to add to the search. You can
mix and match those characters with regular text.
For example, if you type abcd in the Find What box,
click the Special button, choose Paragraph Mark,
and then perform the search, Word looks for all
occurrences of the characters abcd followed by a
paragraph mark.
This quick and easy method will find all the charac-
ters listed in Figure 20-4 and Table 20-1.
• Figure 20-4: The items that a standard search is supposed
to be able to find.

Technique 20: Finding and Replacing in the Wild
148
TABLE 20-1: FORMATTING CHARACTERS THAT SEARCH CAN FIND
Character
Timesaving Tip
Paragraph Mark
Matches a paragraph mark (you can see your paragraph marks, can’t you?) but doesn’t
match manual line breaks (see entry below).
Tab Character
Matches Tab characters.
Any Character/Digit/Letter
Matches any single character (including all the formatting characters mentioned in this
table)/any single digit (numeral between 0–9)/any single alphabetic letter (a–z, A–Z).
Caret Character
Matches a caret (the character above the number 6 on your keyboard).
Section Character
Matches the interlocking-ss (§) character only. It has absolutely nothing to do with section
breaks or section break marks in a document. Very confusing.
Paragraph Character
Confusingly, this is not a paragraph mark; it’s the character in most fonts that looks like a
paragraph mark (¶). For example, if you were writing about what the paragraph mark does,
you might choose Insert➪Symbol to insert a printing character that shows what the para-
graph mark looks like.
Column Break
Finds breaks inserted by choosing Insert➪Break➪Column Break.
Em Dash/En Dash
As expected, finds em dashes (—) and en dashes (–).
Endnote Mark
Finds an autonumbered endnote’s number. Does not find manually numbered endnotes.
Field
Finds any Word field code. Only works if field codes (as opposed to results) are visible.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View, mark the Field Codes check box, and click OK.
Footnote Mark
Finds an autonumbered footnote’s number. Does not find manually numbered footnotes.
Graphic
Finds any picture inserted into the document (Insert➪Picture) that’s not in the drawing layer
(see Technique 11). Does not find AutoShapes, WordArt, and so on.
Manual Line Break
Matches a soft return, which you create by pressing Shift+Enter.
Manual Page Break
You create a page break by choosing Insert➪Break➪Page Break. Confusingly, this choice
does not find Next Page, Even Page, or Odd Page section breaks from the same Word dialog
box.
Nonbreaking* Hyphen
Matches a nonbreaking hyphen (–), which you insert by pressing Ctrl+Shift+hyphen (-).
Nonbreaking** Space
Matches a nonbreaking space, which you insert by pressing Ctrl+Shift+spacebar (°).
Optional Hyphen
Matches the optional hyphen, inserted by pressing Ctrl+– (minus sign).
Section Break
Finds Next Page, Continuous, Even, or Odd section breaks, which you insert by choosing
Insert➪Break.
White Space
Finds any number of regular or nonbreaking spaces or tab characters, in any combination.
*Using nonbreaking hyphens prevents excessive hyphenation at the end of a line and the beginning of the next line. For example,
if well-proportioned fell at the end of a line but needed broken for spacing, without this formatting, you might end up with 
well-pro-portioned. Very ugly.
**Using nonbreaking spaces prevents paired words/symbols from separating at the end of a line and the beginning of the next line. For
example, if you need numerals to stay paired with words, use a nonbreaking space between then, like 150°milligrams, which will
always keep 150 and milligrams together.

Matching Wildcards
149
Matching Wildcards
Many people know that Word can search for wild-
card patterns. Look for wo?dy, for example, and
you’ll match woody and wordy but not wooody.
However, few people realize that checking the Use
Wildcards check box in the Find and Replace dialog
box actually causes Word to switch to a completely
different search engine.
Word uses two separate, completely independent
ways of searching, and the wildcards search engine
is a vast improvement over the fast and easy (but
not very versatile) way of searching. With wildcards,
you access a newer, better search database that can
save you eons of time. For example, only the wild-
card search engine supports the 0-or-more character
match commonly denoted as *. Search for w*dy, and
you match woody, wordy, wooody, and wdy. You can’t
do that with a standard search.
Word’s wildcard search capabilities resemble a
mini programming language. If you have
something specific that you look for over and
over again, it would be well worth your while
to come up with the precise search string that
finds what you want and then save the handi-
est search strings in a document or someplace
else that’s readily accessible.
To perform a wildcard search quickly
1.
Bring up the Find and Replace dialog box (refer
to Figure 20-1).
Pressing Ctrl+F is fastest, but you can also choose
Edit➪Find. Or, click the Select Browse Object dot
in the lower-right corner of the screen and then
click the Find icon (looks like binoculars).
2.
Click the More button if the lower half of the
dialog box isn’t showing; then select the Use
Wildcards check box (see Figure 20-5).
• Figure 20-5: A wildcard search for g?n.
3.
Type the text (optionally including wildcards;
see Tables 20-2, 20-3, 20-4, and 20-5) in the Find
What box.
Feel free to combine any regular text with wild-
cards. As long as you avoid the special wildcard
search characters ( ^ ? [ ] < > ! { } @ ), Word
treats the text you type the same way it would
in a simple search.
In Figure 20-5, I type g?n. This will match gun and
gin and highlight the last three letters of Pagan
or the first three letters of gangly or the middle
three letters of octagonally, but it will not match
goon or grin or bargain.
4.
Click the Find Next button.
Word highlights the first match.
5.
If any match was found, immediately click
Cancel.
That makes it easy and quick to click the down
arrow below the Select Browse Object dot (refer
to Figure 20-2) to repeat the search.

Technique 20: Finding and Replacing in the Wild
150
All the special characters available that I mention
earlier in “Searching for More Than Plain Text”
(except Word field codes) are accessible in a wild-
card search when using the codes in Table 20-2. Be
careful to put a caret in front of the number, with no
intervening space.

If you need to perform complex searches, the
wildcard codes in Table 20-2 might make it pos-
sible to find or change information in your docu-
ments in a matter of seconds, whereas searching
for or changing the text manually can minutes
or even hours. See the example in “Replacing
with Care,” at the end of this Technique, for one
common application — removing extra para-
graph marks in a document.
Building on the common characters (letters, num-
bers, punctuation marks, and the like) and the for-
matting characters in Table 20-2, you can put
together wildcard patterns for your searches. For
example, you can look for 1?34 or a*b. I list the most
common search patterns in Table 20-3.
Any wildcard search is automatically a Match
Case search: Selecting the Use Wildcards
check box implies Match Case even though
the Match Case box in Search Options is not
enabled. For example, if you select Use
Wildcards and search for A?c, you match Abc
and ABc but not abc nor ABC.
The wildcard search engine supports an enormous
variety of search characters, only a fraction of which
appear when you click the Special button at the bot-
tom of the Find and Replace dialog box (see Figure
20-6). Note that this menu is different from the one
shown in Figure 20-4, which is one indicator that the
Use Wildcards check box switches Word to a differ-
ent database.
• Figure 20-6: Some of the vastly superior wildcard search
selections.

Matching Wildcards

You can restrict searches to the beginning and end-
ing of words, as demonstrated in Table 20-4.

stRine but not lined.
words
You can combine the beginning and ending
patterns. For example, searching on <de*ed>
will match deed and deleted but not bedeviled.
The wildcard search patterns can be combined to
make it easier and faster to search for certain
repeated text or formatting characters in your docu-
ment. For example, you can tell Word to look for two
or more consecutive paragraph marks or to match a
specific letter followed by an arbitrary number of
numbers. I list the most useful repeating patterns in
Table 20-5.

The backslash (\) occupies a pivotal place in
wildcard searches, but the blasted character can
be completely unpredictable. In general, the \ is
a literal delimiter: that is, whatever follows a \ is
supposed to be, literally, what Word searches
for. So if you want to search for a question
mark in a wildcard search, you type \?.
Unfortunately, the backslash is ignored some-
times and doesn’t work right other times. Avoid
it if at all possible — and if not, test, test, test!

After you click Replace or Find Next, Word high-
lights the next occurrence of the text in the Find
What box.

Only when you’re satisfied that the Replace
operation is set up properly — and you won’t
get any weird matches — click the Replace All

Otherwise you might find that all your video
boards change to video boaRoads.
Replacing with wildcards
You can click the More button on the Replace tab
(refer to Figure 20-7) and use all the tricks that I
describe in the preceding sections for setting up
wildcard searches. Here are a few significant oddities:

^13: Do not use ^13 in the Replace With box.
You’ll end up with a character that looks like a
paragraph mark but doesn’t act like one. (To see
the bug: Format a replaced ^13 mark as Heading
1. See how the height isn’t adjusted properly?)
You should always use ^p for a paragraph mark
in the Replace With box even if you’re forced to
use a ^13 for the same paragraph mark in the
Find What box to perform a wildcard search.

Capital letters: If you use capital letters in the
Replace With box, Word replaces anything that
matches the Find What criteria with precisely
what you type in the Replace With box. That’s
why the lowercase rd gets replaced with initial-
capped Road in the preceding steps.

Word sez: If you select the Find All Word Forms
(English) check box, Word forces you to choose
a word if you click the Replace button.
The Replace With box takes three codes that aren’t
available in the Find What box:

^c: This pastes the contents of the Windows
Clipboard, or the last entry in the Office
Clipboard, into the current location.
Replacing with Care
Word’s Replace works much like Find, but note some
a few key differences. To perform a simple replace,
do the following:
1.
Bring up the Find and Replace dialog box (see
Figure 20-7).
Press Ctrl+H (if you can remember the shortcut)
or choose Edit➪Replace. Or, click the Select
Browse Object dot in the lower-right corner of
the screen, click the Find icon (looks like binocu-
lars), and go to the Replace tab.
• Figure 20-7: Replacing the text rd with Road.
2.
Type the text that you want to replace in the
Find What box and type the replacement text
in the Replace With box.
In Figure 20-7, I want to replace the characters rd
(capitalized in any manner) with the characters
Road (with a capital R).
3.
Click either the Replace or the Find Next but-
ton. If you want to replace the selected text
with the contents of the Replace With box, click
the Replace button. If you want to skip this one
and move on to the next, click the Find Next
button.
The first time that Word performs a new replace,
both buttons do the same thing: They locate the
first occurrence of the text in the Find What box
and highlight that text, allowing you to decide
whether you want to make the replacement.

Replacing with Care
153
Say you want to replace your company’s name
with a copy of its logo everywhere in a docu-
ment. To do so, copy the logo to the Clipboard
and then run a Find and Replace. In Find
What, type your company’s name. In Replace
With, type ^c (see Figure 20-8). Then click
Replace All.
• Figure 20-8: The fast way to put your company’s logo
many places in a document.

^&: This takes whatever matched the Find What
box and pastes it into the current location.
Say your boss decides that the HR report can’t
list just Social Security numbers. Every place
where a Social Security number appears, the
report now has to read SSN 123-45-6789. Easy.
Run a Find and Replace. Find What is [0-9]{3}-
[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}, and Replace With is SSN ^&.

\1 \2 \3 and so on: These take a portion of
whatever matched in the Find What box and
places that portion into the current location. The
portions are keyed to parentheses in the Find
What box; the first pair of parentheses surround
\1, the second set gets associated with \2, and
so on. It sounds difficult, but it isn’t. See the fol-
lowing example.
Removing extra paragraph marks
Here’s an example of the power of Word’s Find and
Replace. How often do you get documents that have
paragraph marks or new line characters
(Shift+Enter) at the end of each line?
It’s easy to get rid of them with one run of Find and
Replace:
1.
Bring up the Find and Replace dialog box (refer
to Figure 20-7).
Press Ctrl+H or choose Edit➪Replace. Or, click
the Select Browse Object dot in the lower-right
corner of the screen, click the Find icon (looks
like binoculars), and then go to the Replace tab.
2.
Click the More button and select the Use
Wildcards check box.
3.
In the Find What box, type ([!^13^11])[^13^11]
(see Figure 20-9).
That bizarre command tells Word to find any
character that isn’t a paragraph mark (^13) or
new line character (^11), followed by a para-
graph mark or a new line character. Because the
first part is in parentheses, Word saves whatever
matched on that part of the Find What box and
calls it \1.
• Figure 20-9: Remove extra paragraph marks at the end
of every line with this simple Find and
Replace.
4.
In the Replace With box, type \1 followed by a
space.
The \1 tells Word to insert whatever matched
the expression in the parentheses. The space
replaces the paragraph mark.

Technique 20: Finding and Replacing in the Wild
154
• Figure 20-11: The same document after running the
simple Find and Replace.
5.
If you’re feeling lucky, click Replace All.
Word takes the document with paragraph marks
at the end of each line (and two paragraph marks
separating each paragraph) and strips out the
extraneous paragraph marks (see Figures 20-10
and 20-11).
• Figure 20-10: A document with extra paragraph marks at

Rapid-Fire Styles
T
he vast majority of Word users never learn about styles. To me, that
represents the single greatest global failure in Office education — or
discoverability, if you look at it from the software’s point of view.
At its heart, a style is just a collection of formatting settings. You give
styles names so that you can remember what the style does, and so you
can quickly apply the right style to the right paragraphs or characters.
Styles rate as the original Word timesaving technique. The people who
originally designed Word built styles into the very fabric of the program.
It’s a pity that so much has been done by recent Microsoft designers to
subvert the original, clean implementation — everything from format
painting to deleted paragraph mark inheritance rules to artificially con-
trived, incomprehensible style names have chipped away at styles’
supremacy. But if you stick with the basics, styles still shine through as a
timesaving technique of the first degree.
Getting Styles
If you only use Word to write letters home to Mom, you don’t need styles.
But boy, howdy, do you need styles if

You work on fairly lengthy documents or ones that might have their
formatting changed by management edict.

More than one person will work on a document.

You’re putting together a group of documents that need to look more
or less the same.

You ever need to create a Table of Contents or a List of Figures.

Keep formatting consistent. Control formatting both internally within
one document and among multiple documents. If you have a bulleted
list (like this one) with a style applied to it, this bulleted list looks just
like bulleted lists everywhere in the document or documents.

itself. A lousy set of styles will keep you going back to
tweak the appearance of your work, breaking your
concentration and spinning your wheels. Good styles
make all the difference. I cover all the details on cre-
ating good styles in “Remaking Word’s Default Styles”
and “Making New Styles” later in this Technique.
Styles live in documents, and they live in tem-
plates. You can define a custom set of styles in
a template, and every new document that you
create based on that template inherits those
styles. Similarly, you can define (or change)
styles in normal.dot, and all new blank docu-
ments receive those styles. See Technique 16
for details.
Applying Styles
Word has four kinds of styles, shown in Table 21-1.
Character styles can be applied to individual charac-
ters and control the formatting of the characters.
The other three kinds of styles are applied to para-
graphs and contain formatting not only of the char-
acters in the paragraphs but the paragraph itself.
TABLE 21-1: TYPES OF STYLES IN WORD
Type
Icon
What It Does
Character
Sets the formatting for one or more
characters or inline pictures.
Paragraph
Sets the formatting for an entire para-
graph. (A paragraph in Word’s world
consists of a paragraph mark and all
the text up to and including the para-
graph mark.)
Table
A type of paragraph style that also
includes formatting information about
borders, shading, and cell alignment.
List styles
A type of paragraph style that also
includes formatting information about
bullets, numbering, and indenting.
Numbered list styles might be the bug-
giest, hardest-to-fathom feature in Word.

Change formats. If someone decides that all bul-
leted lists have to be indented more (or less) on
the left, or more (or less) on the right, or that
bulleted items should all appear in bold blue
underline, you make the change once, and that
change is applied consistently, everywhere in the
document or documents, in seconds.

Customize formats. This book was written with
two different sets of styles. The first set was cus-
tomized to make it easier and faster for the
author to write. The second set makes it easier
for the editors to see how the page will appear in
print. We save hours — maybe days — of hassle
because the styles take care of much of the hard
work as well as all the translation between what
the author needs and what the editors want. (Or
is that what the author wants and the editors
need? Hmmm.)

Use Word’s built-in tools. Stick to the styles that
ship with Word — even if you modify them —
and you can create a Table of Contents with just
a couple of clicks. Outlining (View➪Outline)
tools help you organize your thoughts. Document
Map works automatically (View➪Document Map,
see Figure 21-1). Links work in a couple of clicks
(see Technique 22). So do a List of Figures and
tables and much more.
• Figure 21-1: Document Map (on the left) is keyed to style
settings that are set up automatically if you
use Word’s built-in styles.
A good set of styles is unobtrusive: You can concen-
trate on the content, and the format takes care of

Applying Styles
157
Applying a paragraph, table, or list style is a snap as
long as you know the rules:
1.
Click once inside the paragraph, select all 
the text in the paragraph, or select several
paragraphs.
Word creates a jumbled mess of styles if you
select just part of a paragraph and apply a
paragraph style. Don’t do it. Either select the
entire paragraph or click once inside the
paragraph.
2.
Choose the style from the Style drop-down list
on the Formatting toolbar.
To apply a character style
1.
Select the text that you want to format with the
character style.
2.
Choose the style from the Style drop-down list
on the Formatting toolbar.
Some people find it faster to use the Styles
and Formatting task pane rather than the Style
drop-down list primarily because the styles in
the pane are larger and easier to see. To give
the pane a try, click the AA icon on the far left
of the Formatting toolbar or choose
Format➪Styles and Formatting.
Word ships with 160 predefined built-in styles.
I explain how to get at them all in the follow-
ing section.
Manually applied formatting overrides the format-
ting in the style. It’s a very simple concept but one
that can cause some confusion — and wasted time.
To see how manually applied formatting works
1.
Bring up the Styles and Formatting task pane
by clicking the AA icon at the far left of the
Formatting toolbar or choosing Format➪Styles
and Formatting.
I use the Styles and Formatting task pane in this
procedure because it’s easier to see in the
screenshots here in the book. You might find it
faster to use the Styles drop-down list on the
Formatting toolbar.
2.
Type a few words.
In Figure 21-2, I type Methods of Formatting.
Note how the paragraph is Normal style.
• Figure 21-2: Start typing in a blank document, and you
get Normal style paragraphs.
3.
Select a few characters and then click the
U icon on the Formatting toolbar.
Clicking the U icon formats the characters as
underlined. This manually applied formatting
(underlining) overrides the Normal style, and
you can see the underline onscreen.
4.
Press the right-arrow key to deselect the under-
lined characters.
Word really does make a mess of things if you
apply paragraph formatting to a bunch of charac-
ters inside a paragraph. To prepare for applying
a paragraph format, as in the next step, you

Technique 21: Rapid-Fire Styles
158
accomplish the same thing — turn off the
underline — by clicking the U icon again on the
Formatting toolbar.)
In their purest form, styles are really that simple:
A paragraph’s style controls the formatting for the
paragraph (that’s also true of table styles and list
styles, which are just paragraph styles in wolf’s
clothing); character styles applied inside the para-
graph override the paragraph’s formatting; and man-
ually applied formatting overrides everything.
If you change the paragraph’s style, the for-
matting changes in general, but the original
character styles and manual formatting still
shine through.
If you send a document to a friend, the formatting
that you applied sticks with the document: Even if
your friend’s Normal paragraph style is 18-point
Bodoni, your precious text retains the formatting
you gave it unless (and until) your friend has the
audacity to apply a new style.
In precisely the same way, older documents that you
might have sitting around retain their formatting,
too, even if you change Word’s built-in styles. So if
you wrote a bunch of reports in Times New Roman
12 point and then followed the steps in Technique 16
to change the Normal font to 11 point Garamond,
those old documents are still in Times New Roman
12 point. They only change if you open the docu-
ments and apply the style once again.
Chances are pretty good that’s what has confused
you about styles for so long.
You can put custom styles (or redefine default
styles) in a template. If you then send the tem-
plate to a friend or co-worker who creates a
new document based on the template, all the
styles that you defined are available in the new
document.
really must deselect any text that has been
selected — or, equivalently, you can select the
entire paragraph.
5.
In the Styles and Formatting task pane, click
Heading 1.
Word applies the Heading 1 style to the para-
graph, but the manually applied formatting —
the underlining — is still there (see Figure 21-3).
The manually applied formatting overrides the
paragraph’s style.
• Figure 21-3: Manually applied formatting overrides the
paragraph’s style.
6.

case, Heading 1, without underline. (You can

styles is through the Styles and Formatting
task pane.
2.
In the Show drop-down box, choose All Styles.

styles (see Figure 21-5) but not all of them.
• Figure 21-5: In spite of the caption, this is not a list of all

3.

4.
Mark the check boxes next to any styles you
want to see in the All Styles list. When you’re
done, click OK.
In particular, you need to work with the Balloon

came from (see Figure 21-7).
• Figure 21-7: Word’s Reveal Formatting tells you where all

rently working with.
• Figure 21-6: This is where you can choose all the built-in
styles that Word offers.
Working with all of Word’s 160 styles can be more
than a bit time-consuming and overwhelming — not
just because of the sheer number of styles but also
because the styles rarely match the kind of format-
ting that you probably want to apply.
As soon as you’ve scoured Word’s built-in
styles to see whether you can pull out the
style you need, return the Show drop-down
box to Available Formatting to avoid wading
through mountains of styles.
To see what style has been applied to a specific
piece of text, do the following:

161
If you’re trying to juggle many different styles
and want to see a list of paragraph style
names while you type, go into Normal view
(View➪Normal) and make sure that the Style
Area Width is wide enough to display your
style’s names (Tools➪Options➪View; set the
Style Area Width).
Remaking Word’s Default Styles
To make a good, solid set of consistent styles that
work with all of Word’s built-in features (including
Table of Contents, Document Map, Outlines, and
much more), start with the standard styles defined
in Word and make modifications to the styles to suit
your tastes as well as your documents’ needs.
You can create a set of custom styles in a tem-
plate (see Technique 16). Any new document
based on that template will take on the styles
that you defined.
Speaking style-name jargon
Word’s major built-in styles have some names that
might not be familiar:

Heading n styles are for headings (sometimes
called heads in the print trade). Heading 1 is the
highest-level heading — typically, a chapter
name. Heading 2 is the next lower level and so
on. Few documents use more than Heading 4.
Heading n styles are tied into all sorts of timesav-
ing Word features. Stick with them unless you
have an overwhelmingly compelling reason to
give them the heave-ho.

Emphasis and Strong are character styles for
italic and bold, respectively.

Header and Footer are the styles that Word auto-
matically uses for document headers and footers.

List Bullet n and List Number n are for bulleted
lists and numbered lists, respectively. Note that
Word does not include predefined styles for the
last bulleted paragraph in a series or for the last
numbered paragraph. (Many people create styles
for the last bulleted or numbered paragraph to
add extra space before the main text resumes.)
The List Continue n styles are indented like their
associated List Bullet and List Number styles,
but they lack the bullet or number.

Body Text styles were created to be the main
styles in documents that don’t want to rely on
Normal style. (Normal style, as you might guess, is
the style that Microsoft sets up to be the default
style in new blank documents.) The formatting
settings that Microsoft has given Body Text are a
bit odd, so make sure that you understand them
(or change them!) before working with them.

The Table styles exist primarily to tie into Word’s
Table AutoFormat dialog box (Table➪Insert
Table➪AutoFormat). I don’t know anyone who
tries to modify them.
Modifying a style
Redefining an existing Word style is easy:
1.
Bring up the Styles and Formatting task pane
(refer to Figure 21-4) by clicking the AA icon at
the far left of the Formatting toolbar or choos-
ing Format➪Styles and Formatting.
2.
Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the
style that you want to change.
In Figure 21-8, I want to change the Heading 2
style. Why? Because it’s bold italic, and that
offends my Typography 101-entrenched sensibili-
ties, which state clearly that no text should ever
be both bold and italic.

Technique 21: Rapid-Fire Styles
162
• Figure 21-9: Make changes to the style here.
5.
Click OK.
Word modifies the style and, in so doing, modi-
fies every paragraph in the document formatted
with that style. (If you modify a character style,
all the text that has been formatted with that
character style changes to conform to the new
formatting settings.)
Numbering headings automatically
As long as you don’t try to do anything fancy, it’s
easy to get Word to automatically number headings.
For example, you might want to modify the Heading
1 style so that it puts the word Chapter at the begin-
ning of every Heading 1 paragraph and numbers the
paragraphs automatically. That way, you could type
three lines in a document:
• Figure 21-8: Click to the right of the style name and then
choose Modify.
3.
Choose Modify.
Word shows you the Modify Style dialog box, as
shown in Figure 21-9. Several settings in that dialog
box are difficult to understand — and one is down-
right dangerous. See Table 21-2 for some insight.
4.
Make any changes that you need to the style.
In Figure 21-9, I click the italic icon (I ) to toggle it
off. I also mark the Add to Template check box
because I want normal.dot to be modified so that
all new blank documents will have a Heading 2
style that is bold but not italic (see Technique 16).

Remaking Word’s Default Styles
163
I Started Out as a Child
Life in a Small Town School
The Liberation That is Graduation
Apply the Heading 1 style to each of the three lines
and get this:
Chapter 1. I Started Out as a Child
Chapter 2. Life in a Small Town School
Chapter 3. The Liberation That is Graduation
Because the numbering system is keyed to the
Heading 1 style, you can add a new chapter and
rearrange all the chapter numbers by simply apply-
ing the Heading 1 style to a paragraph. Similarly, you
can click and drag the Heading 1 paragraphs to any
place in the document, and chapters are renumbered
automatically with absolutely no effort on your part.
To set up simple, sequential numbering for one
Heading style
1.
Bring up the Styles and Formatting task pane
(refer to Figure 21-4) by clicking the AA icon at
the far left of the Formatting toolbar or choos-
ing Format➪Styles and Formatting.
2.
Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the
style that you want to start numbering and then
choose Modify.
I pick the Heading 1 style and choose Modify.
Word responds with the Modify Style dialog
box (see Figure 21-10).
3.
In the lower-left corner, click the Format but-
ton and then choose Numbering.
Word brings up the Numbered tab of the
Bullets and Numbering dialog box, as shown in
Figure 21-11.
4.
Click once on the numbering scheme in the
lower-right corner and then click Customize.
I always choose the scheme in the lower right
because I never use it for anything else. (Word
overwrites the scheme when you customize it.)
Word shows you the Customize Numbered List
dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-12.
TABLE 21-2: THE STYLE BUZZWORDS IN THE MODIFY STYLE DIALOG BOX
Setting
Explanation
Style Based On
The selected style (shown in the Modify Style dialog box’s Name text box) inherits all the
formatting in the Style Based On box. You specify which formatting in the selected style dif-
fers from the formatting in the Style Based On style — everything else stays the same. This
setting defines a hierarchy of styles. If you change one style, all the styles that are based on
that style change, too. That’s why changing the Normal style’s font from Times New Roman
to Garamond, for example, also changes the font in the Header and Footer styles.
Style for Following Paragraph
When you’re typing and press Enter, the next paragraph appears in whatever style is
listed in the Style for Following Paragraph box. Note this a confusing exception: If your
cursor is anywhere but at the end of the paragraph when you press Enter, the new para-
graph is in the same style as the old paragraph.
Add to Template
If you select this check box, any changes that you make not only take effect in the current
document but are in the document’s template. Thus, every new document that you make
based on the template will include this modified style.
Automatically Update
Beware this, one of the most dangerous settings in Word. Enable this check box, and Word
changes styles based on formatting that you apply manually. So if you manually format a
paragraph and this box is checked, every paragraph in your document with the same
style name is changed. Avoid this cause of accumulated eons of gray hair and bad karma.

than simple, sequential numbering of one par-

you are treading on thin ice and begging for a
time-consuming headache that will never quit.

seen about outline numbering (and more com-
plex numbering) in Word. Follow her instruc-
tions closely at www.shaunakelly.com/

or resign yourself to spending days fighting
Word’s problems.
Automatic style numbering is a tremendous time-
saver as long as you keep it simple.
Making New Styles
Creating a new set of styles is a time-consuming task
but one that can bring large rewards if they’re used
consistently.
There are as many different opinions
about styles as there are about football
teams; no one approach is clearly superior
to another. But if you’re attempting to set
up a group of styles for a large organization,
make sure that you read Bob Blacksberg’s
Laws of Styles, www.woodyswatch.com/
office/archtemplate.asp?v4-n20. Bob’s
words of wisdom apply specifically to legal
firms — the last, most desperate bastion on the
style frontier — but they’re important guide-
lines for anyone who needs to come up with a
robust set of styles that will survive many gen-
erations of writers.
Creating a single new style, on the other hand, is
quite easy:
1.
Bring up the Styles and Formatting task pane
(refer to Figure 21-4).
To do so, click the AA icon at the far left of the
Formatting toolbar or choose Format➪Styles and
Formatting. 
2.
Click the New Style button.
Word shows you the New Style dialog box, as
shown in Figure 21-14.
3.
Type a name for the style and then select the
Style Type. Set the formatting that you want.
In Figure 21-14, I create a paragraph style called
Query, which I use to flag items for follow-up
while I’m writing. It only takes a couple of clicks
to set the Query style to red and bold formatting
(from the A and the B icons, respectively). See
Table 21-1 earlier in this Technique for details
about different types of styles.
If you’re creating a new list style that will auto-
matically number paragraphs, you are tread-
ing on thin ice. Word’s bugs will drive you
nuts. See the preceding section.

Match a Template
If you ever want to refresh the styles in a document
so that they match the styles in the document’s
template, do the following:
If you ever apply a style and you don’t get the
formatting you expect, chances are good that
the style definition in the document got
munged somehow. That’s a good time to
reach back into the template and refresh the
style . . . assuming that you have an up-to-date
template, of course.
• Figure 21-14: Creating a new style takes only a few
seconds.
4.
If you want to put the new style in the docu-
ment’s template (so that you can use it in other
documents based on the same template), select
the Add to Template check box. Click OK.
Don’t ever enable the Automatically Update
check box. That gives Word licence to kill your
styles.
Your new style is ready for use in the Styles and
Formatting pane (see Figure 21-15) and the Styles
drop-down list on the Formatting toolbar.
You can save a lot of time by associated key-
board shortcuts of your choosing to the styles
that you use most frequently. To do so, in the
Styles and Formatting pane, click the down-
arrow to the right of the style and choose
Modify. In the Modify Style dialog box, choose
Format➪Shortcut Key, and set the keyboard
shortcut from there.

Fast Links inside

O
ne of the incredible timesaving features that lies at the core of the
Web is the ability to create links, which are embedded elements
that are specially constructed so that you’re automatically trans-
ported somewhere else when you click them.
Many Word users don’t realize that you can build the same kind of links
inside Word with just a few clicks. I’m not talking about links to Web
sites; those are easy and a bit old-hat. (And unless you follow my advice
in Technique 7, every time you type a Web address, you automatically
create a link that’ll zoom you off to the World Wide Wait.)
I’m talking about links inside the document itself: links that you can build
that transport your readers to places you feel are important, such as
chapters, sections, figures, glossary entries, and references. If you know
the rules and follow them, Word builds some of the links automatically. If
you want to go it on your own, Word has a handful of very powerful fea-
tures that make it easy.
Save your readers some time. Put links in your documents.
Creating a Linked Table of Contents
Automatically
In Technique 21, I talk about the many benefits of using Word’s built-in
heading styles — Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on, down to Heading 9. If
you have a document that uses Word’s Heading n styles, creating a Table
of Contents with links couldn’t be simpler:
1.
Click once where you want the Table of Contents (TOC) to appear.
2.
Choose Insert➪Reference➪Index and Tables➪Table of Contents.
Word shows you the Table of Contents tab of the Index and Tables dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 22-1.

Technique

Linking Text to Headings in a Document
169
• Figure 22-1: If you use Heading n styles, a linked Table
of Contents takes a couple of clicks.
3.
Use the Show Levels box to set the Heading n
level that you want to appear in the TOC.
In Figure 22-1, I set Show Levels to 2, thus telling
Word that I want the Table of Contents to include
only Heading 1 and Heading 2 entries.
4.
Click OK.
Word creates a Table of Contents links, as shown
in Figure 22-2.
• Figure 22-2: A Table of Contents with linked entries for
all Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles.
If your reader is using Word 2003 or 2002
(the version of Word in Office XP), it takes a
Ctrl+click to follow the link, as noted in Figure
22-2. On the other hand, if your reader uses
Word 2000 or Word 97 to read the document,
any stray click of the link will take her zoom-
ing off to the linked location. Many people
find the one-click-an’-yer-gone behavior dis-
concerting, so take the version of Word that
will be used to view the document into consid-
eration before festooning your documents
with many links.
Links created automatically with a Table of Contents
move with the heading. If you drag a heading to a
new location, Ctrl+clicking the Table of Contents link
takes you to the new location. If you cut and paste a
heading to a new location, Ctrl+clicking in the Table
of Contents finds the new location, too.
Unfortunately, if you copy the heading to a new loca-
tion and then delete the old heading, Word isn’t
smart enough to find the new copy. Ctrl+clicking in
the Table of Contents just takes you to the beginning
of the document.
If you move a heading in a document with a
linked Table of Contents, rebuilding the TOC —
to ensure that the links still work — is a good
idea. Rebuilding the TOC is easy: Just click
once inside the TOC and then press F9 (which
updates the TOC field). Alternatively, you can
right-click inside the TOC and choose
Update Field.
Linking Text to Headings 
in a Document
Word’s strong support of Heading n styles isn’t con-
fined to the Table of Contents. You can use them to
link whatever text you want to a heading, too. So if
you have a long document, you can insert a link in
one section that takes the reader to a related sec-
tion. Here’s how:
1.
Select the text inside the document that you
want to be linked.
2.
Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the Standard
toolbar.
The Insert Hyperlink icon is the one that looks
like the Earth in chains. Word responds by show-
ing you the Insert Hyperlink dialog box (see
Figure 22-3).

Technique 22: Fast Links inside Documents
170
it’s error-prone because headings can get moved
around in a document. Unless you take care to main-
tain the links, they can break.
Here’s a better way. It takes a bit more time, but the
links are hard to break:
1.
Click a chunk of text (and/or picture) that you
want to link to.
Make it a good-sized piece of text . . . several
words at least.
The link actually goes to the beginning of the
text that you select. Click the link, and Word’s
insertion point jumps to the beginning of the
bookmarked area. I recommend selecting a
reasonable amount of text because a bookmark
that covers a large area is harder to delete acci-
dentally — thus clobbering the link — than a
tiny bookmark.
You can also bookmark text inside table cells,
entire cells, or groups of cells. You can even
bookmark and link to items in the drawing
layer (see Technique 11).
2.
Choose Insert➪Bookmark.
Word brings up the Bookmark dialog box, as
shown in Figure 22-4. (A bookmark is a location
in a Word document that’s given a name so that
referring to the location is easy.)
• Figure 22-4: Bookmark the Link To location first.
• Figure 22-3: Linking to a Heading n style from anywhere
in the document is a snap.
3.
In the Link To bar on the left side, click Place
in This Document.
Under the Headings category, Word gives you a
list of the Heading n formatted paragraphs in the
document.
4.
Pick the Heading n paragraph that you want to
link to and then click OK.
Word sets up a link to whichever Heading n para-
graph that you picked. Ctrl+click the linked text,
and you’re immediately sent to that paragraph.
This kind of linking suffers from the same problems
that plague the Table of Contents links: If you play
around with the heading too much, the link can get
broken.
Creating Custom Links That
Are Hard to Break
Earlier in this Technique, I describe one easy and
fast way to create links inside a document by using
Word’s built-in Heading styles. If you want a linked,
automatically generated Table of Contents, it’s the
only game in town. The procedure works well, but

Creating Custom Links That Are Hard to Break
171
If you’re working extensively with bookmarks,
have Word show you where they are. Choose
Tools➪Options➪View, mark the Bookmarks
check box, and click then OK. Word shows
light gray brackets around all bookmarks. You
don’t get much information — for example, the
name of the bookmark isn’t displayed; and if
you have overlapping bookmarks, it’s hard to
tell where one ends and the other begins —
but having the gray brackets onscreen will alert
you to Link To locations that already exist.
3.
Type a name for the bookmark (no spaces
allowed) and then click the Add button.
Word sticks a bookmark on the text (and/or pic-
tures) that you selected.
4.
Select the text that you want to link to the
bookmark.
Items in the drawing layer (see Technique 11)
can be linked and also link to locations in the
underlying document. That can come in handy
if you want to link to a figure that appears in a
distant part of the document.
5.
Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the Standard
toolbar.
Word brings up the Insert Hyperlink dialog box
(see Figure 22-5).
• Figure 22-5: Linking to bookmarks is easy, too.
6.
In the Link To bar on the left, click Places in
This Document.
7.
On the right, click the bookmark that you want
to link to, and then click OK.
Word sets up a link, underlines it, and turns it
blue, as shown in Figure 22-6.
• Figure 22-6: The link set up via the dialog box in
Figure 22-5.
Seeing all the bookmarks in your document is
easy. Choose Edit➪Go To; this brings up the
Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box.
In the Go To What box, choose Bookmark (see
Figure 22-7). Word dutifully lists all the book-
marks in the document. Pick one and click the
Go To button, and Word selects the entire
contents of the indicated bookmark.

Technique
Setting Up Your
Own Letterhead
I
f you write letters, this Technique will pay for this book many times
over.
I’m forever amazed — nay, astounded — at how many people in the busi-
ness world jury-rig ways to get around preprinted letterhead. Some peo-
ple hit Enter precisely 13 times whenever they start a letter to get past the
stuff preprinted on top. Others try to use the Tab key (the Tab key, for
heaven’s sake!) to bypass their partners’ list on the left side of the page.
Almost everyone has trouble when a letter goes beyond one page — the
baling wire and chewing gum that works on page one gets all kinked up
and gummy on page two.
I’m also amazed at how much money (and time!) gets wasted when
companies inevitably move, or change their phone numbers or mailing
addresses. If you or your company have a high-quality printer, you
should never be in a position of throwing away thousands (or hundreds
of thousands) of sheets of perfectly good letterhead.
A little bit of letterhead planning can save a ton of time and money. This
Technique shows you how.
Making Letterhead Decisions
The world of letterhead is divided into three camps:

Those who preprint everything on their letterhead, not worrying (or
caring) about the fact that one small change renders everything use-
less and wasted. (These are the same folks who paste labels over the
top of their changed telephone numbers, hoping nobody will notice.
News flash: We do.)

Those who figure that a computer printout is good enough and print
their letterhead as part of the letter itself. (These are the ones who
print their business cards on inkjets, ripping down the perforations,
hoping nobody will notice. News update: I do.)

Creating a New Letterhead Template
173
Before you start, you must have the following:

A handful of copies of your preprinted letterhead
(that is, if you’re using preprinted letterhead).
In this Technique, I assume that you only use
preprinted letterhead for the first page of your
correspondence and that all subsequent pages
are on blank sheets. 

A very good idea of how you want to lay out
the letterhead. If you’re going to print your name
and address, for example, you should have a
good idea of the font and size that you want and
where it’ll go, as well as any artwork you want.

A pencil with a very, very good eraser and a
ruler.
No, you don’t need to know anything about tem-
plates or sections or anything weird.
Here’s how to start setting up your letterhead
template:
1.
Start with a new, blank document. Choose
View➪Print Layout to go into Print Layout view.
2.
Choose File➪Save.
I always save new templates immediately. Word
shows you the Save As dialog box, as shown in
Figure 23-1.
• Figure 23-1: Save the new template right away.

Those who preprint a key piece of their letter-
head — perhaps a logo or maybe the company
name — and then use the computer to print the
stuff that can change. (Yeah, I decided to join
that camp about 10 years ago. Didja guess?)
The people who use preprinted, colored, computer
letterhead paper from the corner stationery store
tend to fall in the second camp, although I’ve seen a
few minimalist designs that aren’t too bad and verge
on the third. Two problems: They all seem to look
the same after a while, and you can probably get a
custom print job for about the same price if you use
more than a few boxes of paper.
Although this Technique covers all three camps, if
you’re ever in the position of trying to decide what
to have preprinted on your company (or your per-
sonal!) letterhead, consider the following:

Color quality: Unless you have an absolutely
gorgeous color printer, color-print quality from a
print shop runs rings around anything that you
can produce from your computer’s printer. 

Print quality: Unless you have a remarkably
lousy printer, the quality of normal-size text on
your company (or personal) letterhead will be
comparable whether you have it run at the print
shop or through your inkjet or laser printer.

Paper quality: When you order new letterhead,
try feeding a few sheets of the paper that the
printer will use through your own printer before
you place the order. Print normal text and pic-
tures and then fold and crease the paper in the
printed area. Some printer’s papers these days are
notoriously bad with inkjets (particularly those
that wick water-based ink), and other papers
(highly textured) are bad with lasers. You want a
clean print, and you don’t want it to smear.
Creating a New Letterhead
Template
Here’s a quick, easy, fast way to create your own
letterhead.

Technique 23: Setting Up Your Own Letterhead
174
Having Word automatically put dates in your
documents is problematic. I’ve been struggling
with this for years . . . and finally came to the
conclusion that it just isn’t worth the time-
consuming hassle. I talk about the problem in
“Making Dates — With a Macro” later in this
Technique. At this point, I would recommend
against putting a date on the second (and 
subsequent) pages of your documents.
5.
Pull out a sheet of letterhead. If you don’t have
any preprinted letterhead, get another sheet of
plain paper.
Don’t put away the ruler or pencil (or eraser).
You still need them.
6.
Draw the same margins around the preprinted
letterhead that you drew on the second (and
subsequent) page(s) of plain paper.
Yes, I know you have to work around some of
that preprinted stuff, and you want your com-
pany’s name on the first page. Patience,
Grasshopper.
7.
Draw rectangles around any additional areas
that need to be blocked off.
For example, if you have a preprinted logo in the
upper-right corner, draw a box around it. Got a
list of fuddy-duddies (sorry . . . board members)
on the left? Box ’em. Artistic swoosh at the bot-
tom of the page? Draw a rectangle around it, too.
8.
Measure the boxes and write down the dimen-
sions.
Yes, with a pencil. Yes, on the sheet of paper. You
want the dimensions inside the margins. Any
preprinted areas that fall outside the margins —
out on the edges of the page — don’t count
because you won’t be printing out there anyway.
So write down the additional amount of space
that you need to reserve, above and beyond the
margins, for each blocked-off preprinted area.
9.
Block off locations for all the other computer-
printed letterhead stuff.
3.
In the Save as Type box, choose Document
Template (*.dot). In the File Name box, type
something sensible (such as, oh, Letterhead).
Click Save.
You now have a new letterhead template. Scary,
huh? Don’t do anything for now. You will need
the template in the section, “Altering Template
Settings.”
Laying Out the Letterhead
Here’s the hard part:
1.
Step away from your computer.
Figure out what you’re going to do before you
touch anything.
2.
Pull out a blank sheet of paper — not your let-
terhead — and the ruler and pencil.
Start by laying out the second page of your tem-
plate. Not the first.
3.
Figure out reasonable margins and draw them
on the blank sheet of paper.
The margins are the boundaries for your typing
on the second (and subsequent) pages of the let-
ter. If you want a page number or a date on the
second (and subsequent) pages, they go above
or below the margins.
I think new pages look best with the margins
at 1 inch on top, 0.75 inch on the sides, and
0.5 inch on the bottom. 
4.
Figure out whether you want anything printed
in the margins on the second (and subsequent)
sheets — your name, page number, date, what-
ever. Write down what you want and where
you want it. Yes, using a pencil. Yes, on a real
piece of paper.
I like to put the page number in the upper-right
corner although your sense of the aesthetic
might vary greatly from mine.

Altering Template Settings
175
• Figure 23-2: Have Word show you text boundaries while
you’re laying out the template.
3.
Choose File➪Page Setup and type the Top,
Bottom, Left, and Right margins that you drew
with your ruler. Click OK.
The settings in Figure 23-3 are good enough for me.
4.
If you have a header or footer that you want to
put on second and subsequent pages, choose
View➪Header and Footer and type the header
or footer that you want. When you’re done,
click the Close button on the Header and
Footer toolbar.
In Figure 23-4, I click inside the header, click the
right-align icon on the Formatting toolbar, type
the word Page, and then click the first icon on
the toolbar, which inserts the page number.
These are items that will be identical in every let-
ter: company name, address, phone number,
smarmy slogan, and so on. Don’t include the
date, the recipient’s name, or anything along
those lines. That all comes later.
No doubt you have writer’s cramp and black fingers,
with your carpal tunnels twitching for the keyboard.
That’s okay. You’re now ready to go back to Mother
Microsoft.
Altering Template Settings
At your disposal are a thousand different ways to
transfer the settings that you sketched in the pre-
ceding section into a Word template. I believe that
the following is the fastest and most foolproof:
1.
Bring up the letterhead template,
Letterhead.dot, that you made in the earlier
“Creating a New Letterhead Template” section
of this Technique.
Word sticks templates in weird places. To see
where yours are, choose Tools➪Options➪
File Locations and look at the setting called
User Templates. If you just finished creating
the letterhead template, though, you might 
be able to find the .dot file at the bottom of
your File menu.
2.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View, select the Text
Boundaries check box, and then click OK. Then
click the Zoom drop-down box on the Standard
toolbar and set it to Whole Page (if you have a
high-resolution monitor) or Page Width (if
you don’t).
It’s much easier to see what’s going on if you
have the whole page in front of you. Word shows
you dotted lines around the margins on the page
(see Figure 23-2).
If you notice the boundaries disappear or other-
wise act strangely as you work on the template,
it’s not your vision. It’s a bug in Word.

Technique 23: Setting Up Your Own Letterhead
176
• Figure 23-3: Set your margins here.
• Figure 23-4: Putting the page number in the upper-right
corner of the header.
5.
Choose File➪Page Setup➪Layout and mark the
Different First Page check box. Click OK.
If you created any second/subsequent page
headers and/or footers in Step 4, they now disap-
pear, but don’t panic. Word has saved them
safely away. (In fact, you’re done with all the set-
tings for second and subsequent pages.) What
you see is the “different” first page, which needs
some work.
6.
Block off rectangles so that Word won’t print
on top of your preprinted letterhead. 
This is where your upfront work in the earlier
section, “Laying Out the Letterhead,” comes in
play. If you don’t have any such rectangles, skip
down to Step 18.
7.
If you can’t see the Drawing toolbar (the one
with Draw on the left), right-click any blank
spot on any toolbar and select the Drawing
check box.
8.
Turn off the %$#@! drawing canvas by choos-
ing Tools➪Options➪General and clearing the
Automatically Create Drawing Canvas When
Inserting AutoShapes check box.
While you’re at it, make a note to read
Technique 11.
9.
Click the Rectangle AutoShape icon on the
Drawing toolbar (the one to the right of the
down-pointing arrow) and then draw a rectan-
gle where you don’t want Word to print (what I
call a no-print rectangle) roughly the same size
and location as the one you drew in pencil.
In Figure 23-5, I draw such a no-print rectangle in
the upper-left corner of the page, where my
preprinted logo appears.
• Figure 23-5: Block off a location where Word dare not
tread.

10.
Right-click the no-print rectangle that you just
drew and then choose Format AutoShape. On
the Colors and Lines tab, make sure that you
have a Line Color and that Weight is not 0
(zero).
You want to be able to see the outline of the no-
print rectangle for the moment so that you can
print the page and get it to line up with your
preprinted letterhead.
11.
Click the Size tab. In the Height and Width
boxes, type the height and width of the
rectangle — the height and width you wrote
down in pencil, of course. Make sure that both
Scale spinners are set at 100%.
12.
Click the Layout tab. Click the Tight icon —
assuming that you want Word to wrap text
tightly around the box — and then click the
Advanced button.
You see the Advanced Layout dialog box, as in
Figure 23-6.
• Figure 23-6: Force Word to line up the no-print rectangle
with the page so it doesn’t go scurrying
around.
13.
On both Absolute Position lines, choose Page
from the drop-down boxes. Select the Lock
Anchor check box in the Options area, and then
click OK twice to return to your document.
Don’t worry about the measurements for the
moment. What’s important is that you lock the
rectangle to the page itself (see Figure 23-7) so
that it won’t flip-flop all over the place even if
you change your mind about the other parts of
the template someday.
• Figure 23-7: The no-print rectangle is anchored to
the page.
Hanging or left indents may not work when com-
bined with blocked off sections. If you absolutely
must have hanging indents or left indents to the
right of a blocked-off preprinted part of your let-
terhead, you can use multiple sections and
adjust the margins in each section, but that turns
very ugly, very fast.
14.
Carve out as many rectangular no-print zones
as you need, following Steps 10–13.
15.
Print a test page.

Technique 23: Setting Up Your Own Letterhead
178
The page at this point consists of rectangles sur-
rounding no-print areas. Print it, stick the sheet
of paper that came out of your printer on top of
your preprinted letterhead, and hold both of
them up to a strong light. How close did you get
on the first try?
16.
Click and drag the no-print rectangles in the
document until they line up with your
preprinted letterhead.
Remember that you can drag the rectangles just
a smidgen by clicking the rectangle, holding the
mouse button down, pressing Alt, and then drag-
ging the rectangle. Holding down Alt lets you
nudge the rectangle very tiny distances without
Word’s snap feature getting in the way (see
Technique 11).
17.
When you’re happy with the no-print rectan-
gles, right-click each rectangle in turn, choosing
Format AutoShape and then setting the Color
box (under Line) to No Line (see Figure 23-8).
• Figure 23-8: When the no-print regions are lined up
properly, make the rectangles invisible.
You now have all the preprinted regions on your
letterhead well and truly blocked off, and no tell-
tale lines will print.
18.
Choose File➪Save and save the template.
You need it in the following section.
Adding Text to Your 
Letterhead Template
With the no-print areas blocked off (see the preced-
ing section), you’re ready to put your own text —
and drawings, if you wish — in your letterhead tem-
plate. This is the text that you want to appear over
and over, each time you use the letterhead.
With two exceptions, there are no hard-and-fast rules
for laying out the text in your document. You can

Put text or drawings in the body of the docu-
ment. This is a particularly good option if you
want to center text on the page, taking into
account a no-print rectangle (see Figure 23-9). In
that case, just type and format your name and
address, select the paragraphs, and click the
Center icon on the Formatting toolbar — and
you’re done in under a minute.
• Figure 23-9: My name and address, centered between
the preprinted logo (blocked out on the left)
and the right margin.

Put text or drawings in the header or footer.
Add as much as you like, anywhere you like.
Putting a lot of text in the header will drive down
text in the body of the document. (That’s how
Word’s headers work: If they get too big, they push
down whatever is in the main part of the docu-
ment.) However, feel free to chuckle to yourself,
knowing that sticking gargantuan amounts of text
in the header won’t budge your no-print rectangles
because they’re anchored to the page itself.

Adding Text to Your Letterhead Template
179
Keep an eye on the text boundary line at the
bottom of the template, however, particularly
if you add anything to the footer. Unlike
Word’s headers (which push text down as they
get larger), Word’s footers aren’t smart enough
to push text up if they get too big. 
The only way to make more room for Word’s
footers is by increasing the bottom margin
(File➪Page Setup➪Margins) or lowering the
footer itself (File➪Page Setup➪Layout).
Use Word’s Print Layout view to line up every-
thing. Don’t be distressed by all the bogus text
boundary lines to the right of any no-print areas
(which you can clearly see in Figure 23-9).
Think of them as Word’s bugs in action.

Insert WordArt or a watermark. Insert WordArt
in the main body of the document or in its
header or footer; insert a watermark (which goes
in the header, see Technique 71); or insert any
other kind of drawing or picture.
This template has different first page headers
and footers, so if you put something in the
first page header or footer, it only shows up in
the final document on the first page. That
includes watermarks.

Format however you like. Format fonts, lines,
boxes, columns, tables, highlights, and arrows to
your heart’s content.
With two exceptions, whatever you put in this tem-
plate appears in all documents that you create based
on it. The two exceptions are

Today’s date: If you want to include today’s date
in the template, you should not put it in a header
or footer.

Final paragraph mark: The very last paragraph
mark in the template should be the location
where you want to start typing the letter — typi-
cally, where you want to put the recipient’s name

To put an automatically updated date (typically, the
date that you will type the letter) in the template
1.
Click inside the template where you want the
date to appear.
2.
Choose Insert➪Date and Time.
Word shows you the Date and Time dialog box
(see Figure 23-10). 
• Figure 23-10: This dialog box tells Word to use the
current date.
3.
Make sure that the Update Automatically check
box is selected, pick the format that you like,
and then click OK.
Enabling Update Automatically is imperative if
you want the current date to appear when you
open the template. 
Don’t worry about the autoupdate feature mess-
ing with your date; I explain how to write a
macro that takes care of the problem later in this

With the text, drawings, no-print rectangles, format-
ting, and date in your template, you’re now ready to
save it:
1.
Make sure that everything is hunky-dory.

2.
Make sure that your view settings are how you
like them.
 In particular, choose Tools➪Options➪View
and clear the Text Boundaries check box.
 If you use Print Layout view, choose
View➪Print Layout.
 If you don’t like the rulers hanging around,
choose View and make sure that Rulers is not
marked.
 Toggle off any toolbars that you don’t
want (perhaps the Drawing toolbar?) by 
right-clicking any blank area on any toolbar
and clearing the appropriate check box.
 Adjust your Zoom. 
Take your time. If you’re like me, you’ll live
with this template for a long, long time (see
Figure 23-12).

Making Dates — With a Macro
In the preceding sections, I talk about creating a letter-
head template (Letterhead.dot), closing it, and then
saving all the changes. If you haven’t done that yet, do
so now.
You now need to record a macro to make the tem-
plate work better. This macro runs every time that
you create a new document based on the template,
and it runs immediately when the document gets
created. This macro 

Creates a new document with all of your text and
no-print rectangles, headers and footers, on the
first page and on the second and all subsequent
pages.

Selects the entire document.

Updates the Use the Current Date field (and any
other field that might be in the body of the
document).

Making Dates — With a Macro
181
• Figure 23-13: Create a new document based on your
Letterhead.dot template.
3.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Record New Macro.
Word shows you the Record Macro dialog box, as
shown in Figure 23-14.
• Figure 23-14: Record an AutoNew macro for
Letterhead.dot.
4.
In the Macro Name box, type AutoNew (all one
word; the name is very important). In the Store
Macro In drop-down box, choose Documents
Based on Letterhead.dot. In the Description
box, type any identifying information that you
like. Then click OK.

Converts the date (and any other fields) to text.
After the macro runs and the fields are con-
verted to text, they’ll never be updated again, so
the date that appears in the letter will be the
date on which the macro was run, even if you
open the letter five years from now.

Positions the cursor in front of the last para-
graph mark in the document.
Fast, quick, and easy — and you’ll use it over and
over again.
Although Word makes it easy to display the
current date, the autoupdating has all sorts of
anomalies that make it difficult to make the
date when you created the letter the date that
you see every time you open the file. I’ve
struggled with this problem for a decade, and
the only decent solution that I can come up
with is the one outlined here: Have Word use
the current date but then immediately select
the date and turn it into plain old text so that
it won’t ever be updated again. That’s why you
get to record a macro. There’s no easy way to
have a recorded macro search in the headers
and footers in a document. (You can write a
macro to do it, but that’s a lot of work.) So I
recommend that you put the date in the body
of the document and keep it all simple.
Here’s how to record the macro that makes your let-
terhead template complete:
1.
Choose File➪New. In the New Document task
pane (on the right, about halfway down), click
On My Computer.
Word brings up the Templates dialog box (see
Figure 23-13).
2.
Double-click the Letterhead.dot icon.
Word creates a new document based on
Letterhead.dot. You see all the text and draw-
ings that you put into the template in earlier sec-
tions of this Technique. You don’t see the
no-print rectangles (which protect preprinted
sections of your letterhead), but they’re there.
You also don’t see the second and subsequent
page headers and footers, but they’re there, too.

Technique 23: Setting Up Your Own Letterhead
182
Word responds with the funny, stunted
Recording toolbar shown in Figure 23-15.
• Figure 23-15: Your macro-recording tools, such as
they are.
5.
Press Ctrl+A.
That selects the whole document (but not the
headers or footers).
6.
Press F9.
That updates any Use the Current Date fields.
7.
Hold down Shift and Ctrl, press and release F9,
and then release Shift and Ctrl.
That turns any fields into plain, old everyday text.
8.
Press the right arrow.
That puts the cursor immediately in front of the
final paragraph mark in the document — right
where you want to start typing.
9.
Click the Stop Recording button (the first but-
ton on the Recording toolbar).
You now have a macro called AutoNew in the
Letterhead.dot template. It fires every time that
Word creates a new document based on
Letterhead.dot.
10.
Choose File➪Close. When Word asks whether
you want to save changes to Document2, click
No. When Word asks whether you want to save
the changes to Letterhead.dot, click Yes. If you
get a Privacy warning, click OK.
Congratulations! You just built a template and
macro that should work for a long, long time. 
To see your new template in action, choose
File➪New and click Letterhead.dot (which is proba-
bly at the top of the Recently Used Templates list on
the right). Any time you want to change it, open
Letterhead.dot, make your changes, and save. It’s
really that fast and easy.
Distributing the Letterhead
Template
I know. You’re so proud of your new letterhead tem-
plate you can’t wait to let everybody else use it.
Fortunately, that’s very easy and quick, too:
1.
Locate the template on your PC.
Chances are good it’s in 
C:\Documents and Settings\
<your user name>\Application Data\
Microsoft\Templates.
If you can’t see the \Application Data folder,
Windows is hiding folders from you. Follow
the instructions in Technique 1 to show hidden
folders — and make Windows safe for Office.
2.
Copy Letterhead.dot.
You can put it on a floppy disk, e-mail it, copy it
onto a network drive, burn it on a CD, or stick it on
paper tape and attach it to a homing pigeon’s leg.
3.
Put Letterhead.dot in the template folder on
your friend’s PC.
It’s probably C:\Documents and Settings\
<their user name>\Application Data\
Microsoft\Templates, too, but you might
have to use Windows Search (Start➪Find or
Start➪Search) to locate other .dot files.
4.
Have your friend crank up Word and create a
new document based on Letterhead.dot.
Even in older versions of Word, your buddy
should have no problems at all.
If you do have a problem — most likely the
macro doesn’t run, so the date isn’t right —
choose Tools➪Macro➪Security and lower the
security setting to Medium.

Positioning Pictures
Just Right
T
ell me whether this has happened to you. You spend five or ten
minutes sticking a picture in a Word document, getting it set up
just right. Then you go somewhere else in the document, make a
few changes, and when you come back . . . the picture’s all screwed up.
Then you spend another half hour trying to figure out what in the $#@!
Word thinks it’s doing and another half-hour trying to figure out how to
make Word stop. In the end, you get lucky — something, somewhere
worked right — and you print and save the document, praying that the
next time you open it, nothing else gets jostled.
This Technique should help you understand what Word’s trying to do,
and why. Lest Word exsanguinate you, stick with me here for your gar-
land of garlic and a timesaving wooden stake to make sure that Word
stays in its coffin when you bid.
Working with the Drawing Layer
If you haven’t read Technique 11 recently, now’s the time to do so. There,
find out how the drawing layer — actually, drawing layers — float above
and below every Word document.
If you want to come to terms with the pictures that you put in Word doc-
uments, you must understand the drawing layer and how it interacts with
the text layer. Specifically

The drawing layers float above and below the text layer in a docu-
ment. Think of them as individual transparency sheets, with the text
layer in the middle. You can put drawings (items created with the
Drawing toolbar) or pictures (graphic files inserted into your docu-
ment) on a drawing layer and then move the layer up and down (above
or below the text layer, or above or below any other drawing or pic-
ture on a drawing layer).

Technique 24: Positioning Pictures Just Right
184
You can’t see anything in the drawing layer(s)
unless you work in Print Layout view. Choose
View➪Print Layout.

Pictures in the drawing layer can affect the
location of text in the text layer. That’s how
Word wraps text around a picture: The picture
floats over the text, and you tell Word to have
the text layer wrap around it.

Beware the drawing canvas. As if all this weren’t
complicated enough, Microsoft introduced a new
concept in Word 2002: the drawing canvas. The
drawing canvas (see Figure 24-1) is like a little
piece of drawing layer, stuck in-line with text.
Apparently the drawing canvas was an attempt
to make the drawing layer more understandable,
but in the end, I find its hybrid nature far more
confusing than either pure in-line pictures or
floating pictures.
• Figure 24-1: The drawing canvas puts a piece of the
drawing layer in line with text.
If you run into a feature that requires you to use
the drawing canvas, here’s the only way to insert
a drawing canvas into a document: Turn on the
automatic drawing canvas setting (choose Tools➪
Options➪General; select the Automatically Create
Drawing Canvas When Inserting AutoShapes check
box), and then click one of the AutoShapes on
the Drawing toolbar. The minute you have your

The text layer is unique: There’s only one. You
can put a picture in the text layer — in which
case, it’s in-line with text. You can put a picture in
a drawing layer — in which case it’s floating. You
can’t put a drawing in the text layer, but you can
put text in the drawing layer (for example, with a
text box or a callout).
Confused? I don’t blame ya. It took me the better
part of a decade to figure this out. It isn’t docu-
mented comprehensibly any place I’ve seen.

Pictures in the text layer are treated just like
characters — big characters, in most cases. If
you type in front of a picture, it gets pushed far-
ther down the current line and then onto the
next line, just like a character. If you select a
paragraph that contains an in-line picture, the
picture gets selected, too.
If you have a picture in a document but you
can see only a sliver of the bottom of it,
chances are good that somebody (not you, of
course) inserted the picture into a paragraph
that has a Line Spacing setting of Exactly. To
see the entire picture (and also expand line
spacing enormously in the paragraph), click
once inside the paragraph, choose Format➪
Paragraph, and set Line Spacing to Single.

Pictures in the drawing layer are treated just
like drawings in the drawing layer — with one
exception. Pictures in the drawing layer are
anchored — typically to a paragraph, although
you can manually anchor a picture to the page
itself. If a picture is anchored to a paragraph,
whenever the paragraph moves, the picture goes
with it. See “Working with Anchors” later in this
Technique, for details.
If you work with pictures in the drawing layer,
you absolutely must have Word show you the
anchors that go along with the pictures.
Otherwise, you don’t stand a snowball’s
chance of figuring out where your pictures are
going or why. To see picture anchors, choose
Tools➪Options➪View and mark the Object
Anchors check box.

drawing layer, go back and clear the
Automatically Create Drawing Canvas When
Inserting AutoShapes box.
The drawing canvas is another half-baked
Microsoft idea that you should only use under
extreme duress. (To me, that’s when you must
draw snap-to connectors, like you would in a
flowchart, but Microsoft has lousy support for
flowcharts anyway — there isn’t even a deci-
sion diamond . . . ah, don’t get me started.) If
you want to get your drawings and pictures
off the drawing canvas and into the drawing
layer, just click and drag them off the canvas.
That’s a 5-minute distillation of 12 years of frustrat-
ing experience with graphics in Word. If you ever get
stuck trying to figure out why your picture won’t go
where you want it to go, chances are good the
answer is in this section.
Making a Picture Float
When you insert a picture into a document, it always
goes in-line with text.
Okay. I lied. Here are two exceptions:

If you click inside a drawing canvas and insert a
picture, the picture goes in the drawing canvas.
The drawing canvas itself is in-line with text, 
but . . . I’m going to assume that you follow the
instructions in Technique 11 and in the preceding
section to get rid of the %$#@! drawing canvas.

Also, you can tell Word to insert pictures in the
drawing layer by altering the default insertion
method. Choose Tools➪Options➪Edit and
choose one of the options for Insert/Paste
Pictures As.
Ahem. When you insert a picture into a document, it
always goes in-line with text. If you want the picture
to float — to live in the drawing layer — you have to
tell Word. Here’s how:
1.
In a document, place the cursor where you
want to insert the picture, and then choose
Insert➪Picture➪From File.
In Figure 24-2, I insert a picture after some text. I
can tell that the picture is in-line with text because
 The picture appears between paragraph
marks. I have paragraph marks showing (see
Technique 15).
 I can move the cursor in front of the picture
by pressing the left-arrow key.
 If I put the cursor to the immediate left of the
picture, the text goes in front of the picture,
and the picture gets shoved to the right.
The point is that an in-line picture acts just like a
big character. Nothing particularly magical
about it.
• Figure 24-2: An in-line picture is nothing more than an
overstuffed character.
2.
Levitate the picture into the drawing layer.
Right-click the picture and choose Format
Picture➪Layout.
Word shows you the Format Picture dialog box,
as shown in Figure 24-3.

Technique 24: Positioning Pictures Just Right
186
• Figure 24-4: The picture’s anchor symbol appears next to
the paragraph closest to the picture.
• Figure 24-5: The anchor moves to the first paragraph,
and Word dutifully wraps the text.
If the paragraph containing the anchor moves,
the picture moves along with it, although pre-
dicting precise placement can be a bit dicey
because Word allows the picture to move a lit-
tle bit when the paragraph itself moves.
• Figure 24-3: Any Wrapping Style choice other than In
Line with Text sends the picture into the
drawing layer.
3.
Click the text wrapping style of your choice
and then click OK.
See Table 24-1 for a description of the various
wrapping styles.
I chose the Square icon (Rover number 2). Word
doesn’t move the picture. Instead, it wraps the
text around the picture, in different ways,
depending on the size of the picture and its loca-
tion. (see Figure 24-4). The picture gets a rotation
handle (the green dot above the top of the pic-
ture) and is anchored to the closest paragraph
(the anchor symbol appears).
4.
You can now move the picture by clicking and
dragging the picture. Note how the anchor
moves with the picture.
In Figure 24-5, I move the picture up into the mid-
dle of the text, and the picture is anchored to the
first paragraph in the document, as indicated
(sorta) by the location of the anchor icon. Word
wraps the text on the left and right.

5.
You can rotate the picture by clicking the rota-
tion handle — the green dot on top — and
dragging your mouse.
When Word rotates text around in the Square
wrapping style, it reserves an entire rectangular
area around the picture and flows the text out-
side of that rectangle (see Figure 24-6).
• Figure 24-6: With the picture in Square wrapping style,
Word gives it a wide berth.
Word wraps the text much more carefully around
the picture after I right-click the picture, choose
Format Picture➪Layout, click the Tight icon
(sorry, Rover), and click OK. See Figure 24-7.
• Figure 24-7: Changing to Tight wrapping style brings the
text in much closer.
If you ever want to put the picture back in-line
with text (perhaps to get rid of any weird
drawing layer residue, so you can try all over
again), right-click the picture, choose Format
Picture➪Layout, click the In Line with Text
icon, and then click OK.


You can move the anchor to a different para-
graph manually. Click the picture. Then click the
anchor and drag it to whatever paragraph you
like. That can come in handy if Word puts the
anchor on a paragraph that isn’t related to the
picture at all.

You can lock the anchor to a specific para-
graph. That way, even if you move the picture,
its anchor stays in place. (It’s particularly helpful
if you’re nudging the paragraph around, and the
anchor keeps flip-flopping to unrelated para-
graphs.) To lock the anchor, make sure that you
first have the anchor where you want it. Then
right-click the picture, choose Format
Picture➪Layout➪Advanced, and select the Lock
Anchor check box.

You can effectively override all this anchor
folderol. Simply lock the picture down at a spe-
cific place on the page. (I use this approach in
Technique 23, for no-print rectangles that keep
Word from printing on top of preprinted letter-
heads.) To make a floating picture stay well and
surely put, first make sure that you have the pic-
ture where you want it. Then right-click the pic-
ture, choose Format Picture➪Layout➪Advanced,
and set both Horizontal and Vertical Absolute
Positions to Page. That nails the sucker to the
floor, so to speak.
Moving Pictures Small
Distances
Word maintains an invisible grid, which it uses to
snap pictures so that they more or less line up, even
when you don’t quite put them in the right place. To
move pictures ever so slightly, you have to override
the snapping feature:
1.
Make sure you have a floating picture sitting in
the drawing layer of your document (see Figure
24-8).
I explain how to do this in the section, “Making a
Picture Float,” earlier in this technique.
Rotating pictures can inflame a few bugs in Word.
Here are some tips for avoiding them:

Avoid turning rotated pictures back into in-line
pictures: If you float a picture, rotate it, and then
put the picture back in-line with text using the
preceding tip, you end up with a weird, rotated
picture that’s not exactly in-line with text and not
exactly in the drawing layer. It’s as if the picture
spun around for 15 minutes and is now trying to
walk a straight line. As best I can tell, the prob-
lem is because of a(nother) bug in Word. If you
need to reset a picture as in-line, you might save
yourself a bit of time and aggravation if you just
start from scratch by deleting the dizzy picture
and reinserting a new copy instead.

Watch out for version differences: Three of my
favorite Word guri (Suzanne Barnhill, Dave Rado,
and Bill Coan) wrote a paper about that weird
half-floating, half in-line state. It can cause prob-
lems if people with earlier versions of Word open
your documents. Before you distribute a docu-
ment with a rotated in-line picture, make sure
you understand the nuances at www.mvps.org/
word/FAQs/DrwGrphcs/RotatedInline.htm.
Working with Anchors
All floating pictures have anchors. As long as a pic-
ture is anchored to a paragraph and you haven’t
changed anything, moving the paragraph moves the
picture. That’s both a blessing and a curse, so it’s
best for you to be keenly aware of how and why
Word is trying to help. Keep in mind the following:

You can tell Word to not move the picture even
if the anchored paragraph moves. Right-click
the picture, choose Format Picture➪Layout➪
Advanced, and then clear the Move Object with
Text check box.

If you click the picture and move it somewhere,
Word moves the anchor to the nearest para-
graph. Nearest here is hard to define or predict,
but Word makes a valiant effort.

Moving Pictures Small Distances
189
• Figure 24-8: A plain-vanilla, floating picture.
2.
To override the snap, click the picture, hold
down Alt, and then drag the picture. Release
the mouse button and then release Alt.
You can click and drag the picture any place that
you like with the Alt key override.
If you prefer to override the snap with the
keyboard, click the picture once, hold down
Ctrl, and use arrow keys on the keyboard.
Most people like to have their drawings snapped to
the grid, most of the time. But if you want to turn off
the snapping behavior completely, make the Drawing
toolbar visible and then choose Draw➪Grid. In the
Drawing Grid dialog box that appears, clear the Snap
Objects to Grid check box.

Technique
Typing Fractions
Fast
I
get messages all the time from people asking me why Word won’t type
fractions for them. They know that if they type the three characters
1/2, Word turns that into a single character: 1⁄2. And if they type 1/4,
Word produces 1⁄4, and likewise 3/4 becomes 3⁄4. But why won’t Word do
the same thing to 1/3 or 4/5? Surely, something must be broken. After all,
their mother’s podiatrist’s receptionist’s nephew is sure that Word makes
all sorts of fractions for him. Why won’t it work right on their machine?
You can easily waste a lot of time trying to figure out what Word is doing
wrong with fractions — when in fact, Word is only doing as much as it
can. The secret: Most normal fonts have built-in characters for 1⁄4, 1⁄2, and
3⁄4, but no other fractions. Some fancy fonts (specifically Unicode fonts)
include a bunch of additional fractions, but in most cases, the font itself
can only provide these three fractions. When you type those fractions,
Word is actually replacing what you type with the built-in characters,
which you can find by choosing Insert➪Symbol.
That’s why Word only autocorrects 1⁄4, 1⁄2, and 3⁄4. Word doesn’t even try to
autocorrect any other fractions — even if the underlying font has built-in
fractions that match what you type, Word won’t use them. You can stop
looking through Help now.
In this Technique, I present a way for producing fractions — any
fraction — quickly and accurately.
Creating Consistent-Looking Fractions
When it comes to fractions in Word documents, you have three basic
approaches:

Use the (default) AutoCorrect option to change 1⁄4, 1⁄2, and 3⁄4 to single
characters and manually enter all other fractions. This approach
leads to a situation where you might have 1⁄2, 1/3, 1⁄4, 2/3, and 3⁄4 all on
the same line. It’s a jumbled mess that looks really, really bad.

looking fractions quickly

Building Your Own Fractions
191

Disable the AutoCorrect option (which I strongly
recommend) and enter all your fractions manually.

Build your own good-looking fractions and create
AutoCorrect entries for them.
To save time with fractions, I suggest either of
the last two options, depending on how impor-
tant good-looking fractions are to you. Although
using “larger” fractions isn’t elegant, it’s fast and
not too jarring to the eye. If you have 1/2, 1/3,
1/4, 2/3, and 3/4 on the same line, people will
be able to read what you’ve typed without get-
ting eye whiplash (which we presbyopes
eschew). Building your own fractions takes a bit
of upfront time, but after the fractions are built
and stashed away in AutoCorrect, Word takes
over, and using the fractions is very fast indeed.
Building Your Own Fractions
By building your own fractions and then inserting
them in AutoCorrect, you can make fractions like 2/5
turn into 2⁄5 as you type. Before you dive into the fol-
lowing steps, you do need to keep a couple of
caveats in mind:

The fractions that ship with a font are meticu-
lously hand-tuned to go with the font: somebody,
somewhere spent days getting that 1⁄2 to look like
a fraction, and to look something like tiny ver-
sions of the numbers in the font as well. You’ll
never be able to match the font builder’s master-
pieces when using the clumsy tools in Word. But
you can get remarkably close.

You have to build each fraction for each font sep-
arately. (If you want a 1⁄3 in Times New Roman 11
point, you have to create it separately from the 1⁄3
in Arial 12 point, for example.)
Here’s the best timesaving solution that I’ve
found: Choose a font and font size for a corre-
spondence font and a heading font (if you
haven’t already), and create a set of fractions
for each font. I explain how to switch between
the two sets using AutoCorrect later in this
Technique. 
Creating the fractions you want to use
This is my favorite way to build a good-looking frac-
tion by using Word’s tools:
1.
Start with a blank document. From the Font
box on the Formatting toolbar, choose the font
that you want for the fraction. 
2.
Choose Insert➪Symbol, select the a built-in
fraction, click the Insert button, and then run
the Zoom factor up to 500% (see Figure 25-1).
• Figure 25-1: The 3/4 character is a symbol in the font.
3.
Press the spacebar, type the new fraction that
you wish to create, and press the spacebar a
few more times.
In Figure 25-2, I type 1/5.

Select the first number, forward slash, and sec-
ond number. Then choose Format➪Font➪
Character Spacing. In the Spacing box, choose
Condensed; in the By box, type 1.
That squishes the fraction together, making it
look more like a fraction. My final fraction (see
Figure 25-5) won’t win any typesetting awards,
but it looks pretty good in text.
• Figure 25-5: The hand-made fraction is on the right.

Juggle the settings — font size, raised position,
and condensed spacing — until you’re happy
with them.
9.
Write down the settings. You can use them
again to make other fractions for this font, at
this point size.
When you’re done building fractions, put them in
AutoCorrect so that they’ll appear automatically
as you type. The next section, “Entering fraction
sets in AutoCorrect,” explains how.
If you aren’t happy with the slash in your frac-
tions, first try making it italic. If that doesn’t
work, try using the slash from the Symbol font
(Insert➪Symbol; and in the Font box, choose
Symbol). Thanks to Woody’s Office Watch
readers SB and LL for those suggestions!

Select the first number in the new fraction,
type 6 in the Font Size box on the Formatting
toolbar, and then press Enter.
In Figure 25-3, I select the 1, type a 6 in the Font
Size box, and then press Enter. (It takes a bit of
practice to get the font size changed this way.)
The idea is to make the first number in your new
fraction about the same size as the numerator —
the top number — in the built-in fraction. 6
points is a good place to start for most fonts.
• Figure 25-3: Adjust the point size of the first number in
the new fraction.
5.
With the first number in the new fraction still
selected, choose Format➪Font➪Character
Spacing. In the Position box, choose Raised. In
the By box, type 4 and then click OK.
Word raises the first number — the numerator-
to-be — as shown in Figure 25-4. The intent is to
raise the first number to roughly the same level
as the numerator in the built-in fraction. You
might find that raising the character(s) by 3
points looks better.
6.
Select the second number in the new fraction,
and then type 6 (or whatever point size you
used in Step 3) in the Font Size box of the
Formatting toolbar. Press Enter.
That scrunches down the denominator — the
second number.

Building Your Own Fractions
193
You can find many Word macros on the
Internet that will produce decent fractions with
a few clicks. (Use Google to look for Word
fraction macro.) Unfortunately, I haven’t
found one yet that comes close to the quality
that you can achieve by simply laying out the
fractions by hand, as I describe in this section.
Entering fraction sets in AutoCorrect
After you have a fraction you can live with, it makes
a lot of timesaving sense to stick it away in
AutoCorrect so that you can use it over and over
again. A bit of warning, though: You can create a
fraction in, say, Times New Roman 11 point, and it’ll
work pretty well if you’re typing in Times New
Roman 10 point or 12 point. But it’ll look really bad if
you stick it in the middle of a line of Arial text.
My solution is to create two sets of fractions: one in
my favorite correspondence font (Garamond 11
point) and another set in my typical heading font
(Arial 12 point). I then assign each fraction a name
that includes both the fraction and its font — 1/5g for
the Garamond fraction 1⁄5, 2/3a for an Arial 2⁄3, and so
on. That way, if I need the fraction 1⁄5 in Garamond, I
just type 1/5g, and Word autocorrects it to my
custom-built Garamond 11 point fraction 1⁄5.
Here’s how to quickly make your own AutoCorrect
entries:
1.
Follow the steps in the preceding section to cre-
ate the fraction you wish to immortalize.
2.
Select the fraction.
In Figure 25-6, I select my Garamond fraction 1⁄5
(but not the surrounding spaces).
Sometimes it’s hard to figure out exactly where
the fraction begins and ends. In Figure 25-6,
for example, when I select the three characters
in the fraction, the highlighting ends before the
right edge of the 5. You might need to use the
arrow keys to make sure that you get the
entire fraction — and only the fraction.
• Figure 25-6: Select the entire fraction but not any
surrounding spaces.
3.
Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect Options.
Word shows you the AutoCorrect dialog box (see
Figure 25-7).
• Figure 25-7: Make sure you tell Word to create a
Formatted Text entry.
4.
Select the Formatted Text radio button, and
then type in the Replace box the code that you
want to trigger an AutoCorrect.

Technique 25: Typing Fractions Fast
194
Every computer has exactly one set of
AutoCorrect entries. (There aren’t separate
entries in different templates, for example.)
You can move AutoCorrect entries among
computers with a utility that Microsoft shipped
with your copy of Office. See http://
support.microsoft.com/?kbid=269006 for
details. Unfortunately, the tool mentioned
there doesn’t always work, so if you have
problems, refer to www.mvps.org/word/FAQs/
Customization/ExportAutocorrect.htm.
Note that the fraction you selected in Step 2
appears in the With box automatically. In Figure
25-7, I type 1/5g because that’s the code I want to
type to get a formatted Garamond fraction 1⁄5.
5.
Click Add and then click OK.
Word takes you back to the document.
6.
Test your AutoCorrect entry by typing the code
and then pressing the spacebar.

Part III
Streamlining Outlook


26
Getting Outlook
Settings Right
I
f you’re like me, you live and die by e-mail. I get about 700 e-mail mes-
sages a day, on average. A good 90 percent of that is spam. But most of
the rest of it requires a response or at least an acknowledgment, so
every little bit of timesaving I can squeeze out of Outlook counts big-time.
Outlook comes festooned with time-sinks. I don’t use Journals (which
automatically track documents), and I bet you don’t either — Microsoft
buried the feature in Outlook 2003. I don’t want to be reminded with a
ping-ping-ping every time a message arrives. Oy. And those little yellow
sticky notes look great in demos, but they don’t do much to save me
time.
Give me an e-mail viewer that lets me deal with messages quickly and
accurately, a message editor that doesn’t get in the way, a calendar that I
can get into and out of quickly, and a contact list that’s at least as usable
as a phone book. That’s what I need. That’s what this Technique delivers.
Strolling through the Panes
When you first start Outlook 2003, you see your e-mail. Outlook breaks
the e-mail window into three panes (see Figure 26-1).
You see the same three panes when you click the Mail shortcut button:

The navigation pane on the left has a Favorite Folders list, an All Mail
Folders list, and a set of shortcut buttons that transport you to other
Outlook applications.

The message list down the middle shows high-level information from
all the messages in whichever mail folder you’ve selected.

The reading pane on the right (Outlook stalwarts still call it the pre-
view pane) shows you the message selected in the message list.
Rigging Outlook for speed primarily involves granting the reading pane
all the screen space you can find. Being able to read (or at least scan)
your messages without scrolling is an enormous timesaver.

important are the message list in the middle
and the reading pane on the right: The navi-
gation pane just sits there looking dumb while
you’re trying to get some work done. To hide
the navigation pane, press Alt+F1. To toggle it
back, press Alt+F1 again.
For those occasions when you do need the navigation
pane while working on e-mail, remember the following:

Outlook has two fundamentally different mail
navigation panes: the Mail list (which is the
default; see Figure 26-3) and the Folder List (see
Figure 26-4), which includes mail folders plus the
Calendar, Contacts, and so on. To see the Mail
list, click the Mail shortcut (the line that reads
Mail) near the bottom of the navigation pane. To
see the Folder List, click the Folder List icon (the
one that looks like a folder) at the bottom of the
navigation pane.
• Figure 26-3: The Mail list is what you normally see when
you start Outlook.
• Figure 26-1: Outlook 2003 in its initial e-mail view.
Controlling the Navigation Pane
The number-one e-mail timesaving technique for
Outlook 2003? Getting the navigation pane — that
strip down the left side of the screen — out of the
way. Compare Figure 26-1 with Figure 26-2.
• Figure 26-2: Blast the navigation pane out of the way and
get some work done.
If you spend most of your time reading and
responding to mail in your Inbox or in one
of a small handful of folders, you need the
navigation pane only occasionally. Far more

Displaying Your Contacts and Calendar in Separate Windows
199
• Figure 26-4: The Folder List resembles the list in Outlook
2002 and earlier.

Adding mail folders to the Favorite Folders list is
easy; either drag the folder to the list and drop it
or right-click any mail folder and choose Add to
Favorite Folders. Removing folders from the
Favorite Folders list is also a snap; right-click and
choose Remove from Favorites List.
Although you can remove all the folders from the
Favorite Folders list, you cannot remove the list
itself. You’re stuck with the bar that reads
Favorite Folders whether you want it or not.
You can add only mail folders to the Favorite
Folders list. In particular, you can’t put your
Contacts there nor your Calendar.

To move items around on the Favorite Folders
list, just click and drag to the desired location.
Displaying Your Contacts and
Calendar in Separate Windows
Many people find it much easier and faster to have
Outlook put the Contacts list and the Calendar in
their own, separate windows. That minimizes the
amount of flip-flopping that you have to do in the
navigation pane. To switch from Mail to the Contacts
list, for example, you use the Windows taskbar —
and when you’re ready to return to Mail, a quick run
through the taskbar brings you immediately back to
where you left off.
To get the Calendar and Contacts running in their
own windows
1.
Click the Folder List icon (it looks like a folder)
at the bottom of the navigation pane.
Outlook shows you the Folder List (refer to
Figure 26-4).
2.
Right-click the Calendar folder and choose
Open in New Window (see Figure 26-5).
• Figure 26-5: Open a separate window in Outlook for the
Calendar application.
Outlook starts the Calendar application and sets
it up in a brand-new window (see Figure 26-6).

In Mail’s Folder List, right-click Contacts and
choose Open in New Window.
Outlook starts the Contacts application in its
own new window.

5.
To shut down a single application, click the X
in the upper-right corner. To shut down all
Outlook applications, switch to any one of them
and choose File➪Exit.
If you used the Open in New Window feature in ear-
lier versions of Outlook, you might recall that Outlook
forgot about its multiple applications unless you shut
it down gently by choosing File➪Exit. Fortunately,
Outlook 2003 isn’t so forgetful, and you can shut
down any of the running programs any way you
wish.
Moving More Mail Faster
When it comes to shoveling e-mail bits, I need all the
timesaving help I can get.
It all boils down to putting as little information as
you can get away with on the screen and clearing the
way for as big of a reading pane as possible. By giv-
ing yourself more room for the reading pane, you
increase your chances of being able to see entire
messages without scrolling — and without killing
your eyes.
Although Outlook has oodles and oodles of
security holes, the reading pane isn’t one of
them. As of this writing anyway, it doesn’t
appear to be possible to create a virus that can
crack into your system when you simply view
a message in the reading pane. 
You might like the way Outlook gives you a big, two-
line “landing strip” with information about each mes-
sage (see Figure 26-9). Personally, I prefer much
more, uh, compact entries on the Message list pane.
If I’m really curious about the precise (long-winded)
subject, or the size, of a message, I can always hover
my mouse over the message and give it a leisurely
gander. But when I’m running through a hundred

Choose among the running applications from
the Windows taskbar (see Figure 26-7).
• Figure 26-7: Outlook has three applications running in the
Windows taskbar: Inbox, Calendar, and
Contacts.
Old Windows hands will no doubt recall that
you can switch among running Windows
applications by using the Alt+Tab CoolSwitch.
Holding down the Alt key and pressing Tab
repeatedly (see Figure 26-8) is a very fast way
to cycle among the various Outlook programs.

Contacts are all Outlook applications, you

messages, hellbent for leather, I only want enough
info to decide — quickly — whether I really need to
read the message.
• Figure 26-9: Outlook’s more-than-ample landing strip for
each message takes up a lot of room.
Slimming down the Message List pane
For me, the two-line entry is overkill, and if you try
the one-line version, I bet you’ll agree (especially if
you press Alt+F1 and sack the navigation pane while
you’re working). Here’s how to limit Outlook to one
line per message in the Message list pane (or make
the landing strip bigger, if you must):
1.
If you can’t see e-mail, choose Go➪Mail.
2.
Choose View➪Arrange By➪Custom.
You see the Customize View: Messages dialog
box. (Microsoft really buried this setting.)
3.
Click the Other Settings button.
You see the ambiguously named Other Settings
dialog box (see Figure 26-10).
4.
Clear the Use Multi-Line Layout in Widths
Smaller Than check box, and select the Always
Use Single-Line Layout radio button. Then click
OK twice.
Outlook summarizes your messages in the
Message pane, one on a line, so they’re much
easier to scan (see Figure 26-11).
• Figure 26-10: Turn the two-line landing strip into a svelte
one-liner.
• Figure 26-11: With one line per message, it’s much easier
to scan your way through tons of e-mail.
Some people like to see the date and time
received, but I find that this gets in the way on
smaller screens, particularly if you sort by date
received anyway. When you sort by date, the

That gives the message a literal red flag and
automatically adds the message to the For

Unfortunately, you cannot flag a message for
follow-up by using the keyboard.
See an extended discussion on flagging and
follow-up in Technique 28. It’s a very powerful
feature worthy of your consideration.

Finally, to move through messages quickly, don’t
download pictures stored on the Web that are refer-
enced in formatted (HTML) e-mail messages (so-
called Web beacons; see Technique 30). If you really
need the pictures to understand the message, you
can always right-click the specific pic and let Outlook
go retrieve it. But when you’re scanning as quickly as
you can, waiting for Outlook to grab pics rates right
up there with watching grass grow — or watching

sages, so why repeat it? To move the Received
field, click Received in the title bar and drag it
to the right. Then click and drag the edge to
scrunch it down to a tiny sliver. (See it
smashed between Size and the follow-up flag
in Figure 26-11.) If you ever need to see the
entire field, just drag the left edge to make it
bigger. If you ever sort one of the other fields
(From, Subject, Size, and so on), you can go
back to sorting by Received date and time by
clicking that little sliver.
What? You like the big landing zone? In that
case, consider widening it to three lines so that
you can see more details about each incoming
message. To do that, choose View➪Arrange
By➪Custom, click Fields, and bump up the
box marked Maximum Number of Lines in
Multi-line Mode.
Navigating the Message list in a flash
With the navigation pane stowed and the message
list stunted, with a little practice, you can move very
quickly through miles of messages. (Um, remember
that you have to have a message selected to take
any action with it).

Scan messages in the message list on the left.

To delete a message, click it, and then either
press Ctrl+D or press the Delete key.
You can delete sequentially down your message
list by pressing Ctrl+D or the Delete key multiple
times, and Outlook will catch up with you.

If you see a message or a subject of interest,
scan it in the reading pane on the right.

To skip over a message and do nothing, press
the spacebar or the down arrow.

To reply to a message, press Ctrl+R (or Alt+R).

Adjusting the E-Mail
Editor Settings
Unless you do something to change it, Outlook 2003
uses Word as its e-mail editor.
I’ve railed against WordMail (that is, the use of Word
as Outlook’s e-mail editor) for almost as long as the
feature has been available. Outlook and Word are
tied together with bailing wire and chewing gum, and
the combination has had a tendency to disintegrate
in a gooey, wirey way. But with Outlook 2003, it
seems as though Microsoft has finally made the two
coexist peacefully. Most of the time.
Here’s one indisputable fact: If you can use
Word as your Outlook e-mail editor, you’ll be
able to work faster and more confidently than
with the under-aspirated native e-mail editor.
Two of the big reasons why are that you already
know how to use Word, and that most of
Word’s features are available when you’re writ-
ing e-mail.

Technique 26: Getting Outlook Settings Right
204
As far as I can tell, WordMail picks up the remain-
der of the Tools➪Options settings from Word
itself. We’re treading in the Twilight Zone here
because Microsoft doesn’t document any of this
stuff, but I believe that’s what’s happening.
5.
Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect Options➪
AutoFormat as You Type.
WordMail shows you the AutoCorrect in Email
dialog box, as shown in Figure 26-15.
6.
Clear all the check boxes under Apply as You
Type. Also clear the Format Beginning Of List
Item Like the One Before It check box. Click
OK. Close out of the e-mail message.
WordMail is now safe to use.
• Figure 26-14: Keep track of the inner workings of your
e-mail messages.
Outlook 2003 uses only Word 2003 as its
e-mail editor, so if you bought Outlook 2003
alone (without the rest of Office 2003),
expecting that you would be able to use
Outlook fully, you’re in for a rude awakening.
Word has been trimmed down in many ways for its
WordMail persona — when it’s acting in its capacity as
e-mail editor for Outlook. One of the big differences
between Word and WordMail is the emphasis on
styles: In WordMail, it’s very difficult to work with
styles. (The fact that the default font in WordMail is
Arial 10 point manually applied on the Normal style
from normal.dot should make experienced Word users
cringe.) I’d love to be able to use styles to, for exam-
ple, set off monospaced macro code or quotes from
incoming messages. Many other features in Word are
mutated extensively for the Outlook environment.
At a minimum, I suggest that you make the following
changes to WordMail. Explanations parallel those
given in Technique 15, where I have you make simi-
lar changes in Word itself:
1.
If you can’t see your e-mail, choose Go➪Mail.
2.
Click New to start a new e-mail message.
This also fires up WordMail — in Microsoft parl-
ance, Outlook starts a hidden instance of Word,
which is used to edit e-mail messages.
3.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View. Enable the Tab
Characters, Paragraph Marks, and Object
Anchors check boxes. Don’t click OK just yet —
more changes need to be made.
The View tab of the Options dialog box should
look like Figure 26-14.

Click the General tab. Clear the Automatically
Create Drawing Canvas When Inserting
AutoShapes check box. Then click OK.

Making Other Timesaving Changes

• Figure 26-15: These IntelliNONSense settings are just as

itself.
Making Other Timesaving
Changes
After I put copies of the Calendar and Contacts list in
their own windows (see the procedure in “Controlling
the Navigation Pane,” earlier in this Technique), I
make two more changes to Outlook. You might find
these to be big timesavers, depending on how you
use Contacts and the Calendar:

In the Contacts window, I choose View➪Arrange
By➪Current View➪Phone List. That puts the
Contacts in phone list view, which crams many
names on the screen.

In the Calendar window, I click the 5 Work Week
button on the main toolbar. That shows each of
the five working days in the current week, each
in its own strip.

Searching with
Folders
I
f you’ve used Outlook for any time at all, you’re accustomed to folders:
There’s an Inbox folder, a Junk E-mail folder, a Sent Items folder, and
so on.
Search folders are different because they don’t hold any real messages:
They’re just collections of pointers to messages. The messages themselves
reside in normal folders. If you’ve ever used Windows’ Search function
(Start➪Search), you’ve seen the same thing — except in Outlook 2003,
the results are always available.
Most people, at first, tend to set up search folders for everything under
the sun. In other words, search folders turn from timesavers to time-
wasters in the blink of an eye. The trick with search folders is to use
them sparingly and strategically — and to avoid using them when better,
less persistent alternatives are available.
That’s what this Technique is all about.
Using Search Folders
Although Windows searches look for files and folders, and Outlook
searches look for stuff inside Outlook, they surprisingly have something
important in common.
When you perform a search in Windows, Rover — bless his pointy little
Bobbed ears — delivers a list of files that match your search criteria (see
Figure 27-1). The files aren’t moved anywhere: They’re still sitting in the
same place they’ve always been. Searching merely gathers a list of all the
files that match your criteria and presents them in a single window so
that you can work with the found files.
You might not realize it, but Windows searches are updated continuously.
For example, if you search for music files on your computer (as in Figure
27-1), leave the Search Results window open, and then copy a new music

file to your computer, that new file appears in the
Search Results window, although it might take a few
seconds for Rover to update the list.
• Figure 27-1: Results of a Windows search. Go, Rover, Go.
On the downside, Windows searches aren’t saved —
and indeed, aren’t savable. If you close a Search
Results window or shut down Windows itself, you
have to laboriously reenter the search. Windows
gives you no alternative.
Outlook’s search folders work a lot like Windows
Search Results windows, with two notable exceptions:

Search Folders (yup, it’s a folder) automatically
saves the search. Because Outlook Search
Folders results get updated continuously, just as
in Windows Search, you can set up an Outlook
search folder and look at it a week from now and
rest assured that it has an up-to-the-second list
of all the e-mail messages that match the criteria
that you established a week earlier.

Search Folders searches only for Outlook e-mail
messages and only in a very narrowly defined set
of locations.
Whereas a Windows Search can look for just
about anything, anywhere, Outlook Search
Folders is restricted to looking only for e-mail
messages (no Contacts or Calendar entries or
Tasks) and only in the current folder’s Mail
subfolders. You can tell Outlook to look in a
folder and all its subfolders but you can’t tell
Outlook to look inside two different high-level
folders. For example, if you have two main
folders — say, Personal Folders and Archive
Folders (see Figure 27-2) — you can create a
search folder that looks for e-mail messages in
Personal Folders or a search folder that looks
for e-mail messages in Archive Folders.
However, you can’t create a single search
folder that pulls messages out of both Personal
Folders and Archive Folders.
Another limitation is that Outlook refuses to cre-
ate search folders for the Hotmail folder. For
example, if you set up a search folder to keep
track of orders, any orders sent to your Hotmail
account won’t go in the search folder.
• Figure 27-2: Outlook Search folders can look only in a
single main folder at a time.
When you first start Outlook, two of the five default
Favorite Folders in the navigation pane (two of the
four if you don’t have a Hotmail account; see Figure
27-3) are, in fact, search folders:

Technique 27: Searching with Folders
208
Creating Search Folders
Microsoft’s help and training encourage you to
create a search folder by choosing File➪New➪
Search Folder, but that approach doesn’t give you
the advantage of seeing the results before setting the
criteria in search folder concrete. Here is a far better
way to create your own search folder:
1.
If you don’t see e-mail messages, choose
Go➪Mail.
2.
Choose Tools➪Find➪Advanced Find.
Outlook shows you the Advanced Find dialog
box (see Figure 27-4), ready to search for e-mail
messages.
• Figure 27-4: To create a search folder, start by running a
search.
3.
Click the Browse button in the upper-right
corner.
Outlook presents you with the Select Folder(s)
dialog box (see Figure 27-5). Think carefully
about which folders you wish to search. In most
(but not all) cases, you want to avoid the Junk
E-mail folder. In some cases, you want to avoid
Deleted Items. Only rarely would you want to
search every mail folder because you’re bound
to come up with a bunch of junk. Literally.
• Figure 27-3: Two of these folders are search folders.

Unread Mail searches for unread messages in
the Inbox folder and any folders underneath the
Inbox folder as well as the Sent Items folder and
any custom mail folders you might have created.
This search folder does not include any mes-
sages from the Deleted Items or the Junk E-mail
folders.

For Follow Up searches for messages with fol-
low-up flags (of any color) in the Inbox; folders
underneath Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and
Drafts; and any custom mail folders. See
Technique 28 for ways to save time with follow-
up flags.
For Follow Up doesn’t include any messages in
the Deleted Items folder nor in Junk E-mail, so
if you accidentally delete a flagged message
(or mark it as Junk E-mail), you’ll never find it
in the For Follow Up search folder.
Outlook also automatically creates a search folder
(of dubious value, frankly) called Large Mail. That
folder appears down in the Search Folders list at the
bottom of the navigation pane but doesn’t appear in
Favorite Folders.
Note that these definitions are quite stringent,
and if you try to customize one of the built-in
search folders (right-click and choose
Customize This Search Folder), the information
Outlook provides is inaccurate. For example, if
you try to customize Unread Mail, Outlook
tells you that it’s looking in all mail folders
underneath Personal Folders. That, demonstra-
bly, isn’t true.

Creating Search Folders
209
4.
Mark the check boxes for the folders that you
want to search. If you want Outlook to search
in subfolders of the chosen folders, mark the
Search Folders check box. Then click OK.
Outlook returns to the Advanced Find dialog box.
5.
Type your search criteria. Click the Find Now
button and let Outlook run the search.
You see the results at the bottom of the
Advanced Find dialog box (see Figure 27-6).
6.
If the search didn’t produce precisely the
results you wanted, go back and change the
search criteria.
Spend some time to get it right. The
Advanced tab, in particular, has an enormous
array of criteria that you can use to force
Outlook to deliver the exact messages that
you seek.
7.
When the search works exactly the way you
want it, choose File➪Save Search as Search
Folder.
Outlook asks you to name the search folder.
• Figure 27-5: Choose your folders wisely.
• Figure 27-6: Take a very close look at the results of the
search.
8.
Give your new search folder a name, click OK,
and then close the Advanced Find dialog box.
Outlook takes the search criteria that you estab-
lished, saves it, immortalizes the results of the
search — and keeps it up-to-date! — by creating
a search folder (see Figure 27-7). Search folders
appear with little magnifying glasses on them.

Technique 27: Searching with Folders
210
Rationalizing Search Folders
Before you start creating search folders by the
dozen, sit back and think about whether they’ll save
you time. Although it’s true that creating a search
folder doesn’t take much effort, creating a good, tar-
geted search folder can be arduous indeed. And if
you have dozens of search folders, every time you
need one, you’ll have to search for the right search
folder (how’s that for an irony?). Pile enough on, and
your machine’s performance will take a hit.
Chances are good that you don’t need a search
folder for

Your boss or any other specific individual: This
is the prototypical demo of search folders —
the one used to sell Outlook to the unwashed
masses — and it’s usually a waste of time.
You can easily create a list of all the messages
sent by a specific individual by right-clicking a
message from that person and choosing Find
All➪Messages From Sender. Doing so triggers the
Advanced Find dialog box (see Figure 27-8), and
you can either double-click each of the messages
listed to bring them up one at a time or choose
File➪Save Search as Search Folder to create a
search folder on-the-fly and see them in the read-
ing pane.

Anything that should be moved with a rule:
Outlook lets you create Rules (custom filters)
that shuffle e-mail messages to specific folders. If
you want to manage a bunch of messages as a
group (for example, to keep track of specific proj-
ects or individuals), you should be using rules
and custom folders. See the “Rules” sidebar.
Search folders are great for keeping track of
cohorts of messages that are shuffled to differ-
ent “real” folders by rules. For example, if you
have separate folders for different projects and
you want to keep track of all the status reports
in all the projects, create a search folder for the
status reports.
Three details illustrated in Figure 27-7 affect your
ability to use search folders to save time:

Find the source: The source folder — the place
where the message actually resides — appears
as a group heading above the listing for the mes-
sage itself. In Figure 27-7, there are messages
from both the Inbox and the Outbox.

Change the view: The search folder has its own
view settings. If you want the search folder to use
only one line for each message in the message list
(the middle pane), you have to go in and tell
Outlook. (Choose View➪Arrange By➪Custom,
click Other Settings, and clear the Use Multi-Line
Layout In Widths Smaller Then check box, select
the Always Use Single-Line Layout radio button,
and click OK twice.) See Technique 26 for more
details about view settings.

Bogies at 1 o’clock: No matter how hard you try,
you’re going to get some bogus entries in your
search folders. For example, Powwow in Figure
27-7 matches the WOW search criteria.
You can change the search criteria that a
search folder uses by right-clicking it and
choosing Customize This Search Folder.
What Happens When I Delete a Message
Microsoft’s Help files gleam with hogwash trying to explain
what happens when you delete a message that you get to
via a search folder. The actual process is quite simple. If you
look at a message while you’re in a search folder (as in
Figure 27-7) and you press Delete, Outlook moves the
message from whatever folder it’s in to the Deleted Items
folder. That’s what Outlook always does.
If your search folder doesn’t look at items in the Deleted
Items folder, the message disappears from the search
folder. Remember that Outlook keeps the search folders
updated continuously. So if you move the message (as is
the case when you press Delete), Outlook updates the search
folder according to whatever criteria you’ve established.
That’s the whole story. Nothing magical. The message goes
where it always does. Your search folder gets updated the
way it always does.

Rationalizing Search Folders
211
• Figure 27-8: A list of all the phishing messages supposedly
from PayPal (see Technique 33).

Big messages. Or small messages. Or messages
with attachments: Most people look only in spe-
cific folders for messages with specific attrib-
utes. Look in your Deleted Items for big
messages, for example. Or look in your Inbox for
messages with attachments. You can do that kind
of searching just as well by sorting the appropri-
ate column in the message list.
Get rid of your unused search folders. Outlook
will run faster when you do.
Outlook ships with one more built-in search
folder, above and beyond the two that I men-
tion at the beginning of this Technique: Large
Mail. It’s hard-wired to look for messages
larger than a specific size (100KB unless you
change it). I figure that this search folder only
exists as demo-ware: Microsoft put it there to
look good in demos. It’s hard to imagine any
real-world use for it (unless you’re download-
ing e-mail headers with Exchange Server and
want to delete big messages so they don’t hog
your bandwidth). Right-click it and delete it.
Rules
Outlook contains an entire programming subsystem: Rules.
In the simplest case, you write Rules to look at and then act
on messages as they arrive, shuffling them into folders or
flagging, forwarding, or deleting them. Rules can even play
a little tune on cue. Cute.
Outlook Rules are notorious for interacting in completely
unpredictable ways, particularly as the number of Rules
goes up and the volume or rate of incoming mail increases.
Although recent versions of Outlook seem to do a better
job of keeping rules from stepping all over each other, the
introduction of junk mail filtering in Outlook 2003 added a
new problem: The Rules kick in before the junk mail filter
does, and you can do precious little about it. Thus, any
message that matches the criteria in a Rule bypasses spam
filtering entirely.
If you want to try your hand at Rules, start with the Outlook
Help topic About managing messages with rules. But as with
all Help, don’t believe anything you hear and only half of
what you read.

S
o I get a message from one of my newsletter subscribers, and he
wants to know about the best way to find a tiny message needle in
an Outlook haystack. It’s an interesting question, but one that’s
going to take some research.
In the not-so-good old days, I would drag that message into a special
folder full of similar messages, in the hope that some day Congress would
legislate 28-hour days and 8-day work weeks. Then I would no doubt have
enough time to go back through the folder and tackle the most interest-
ing, or pressing, problems.
Nowadays, with Outlook 2003, I give the message a purple flag. (Purple
reminds me of indigo, which reminds me of interesting. Pretty lame, huh?)
The message stays in my Inbox — at least until I go through and do some
spring cleaning — and I know I can find it again from the For Follow Up
search folder.
This Technique shows you how to flag and flog mail in the fastest possible
way.
Marking Mail
You can add flags to incoming and outgoing messages and tack on
reminders, too. It’s all pretty quick and easy, and this section shows you
how flags can help you get in and out of your Inbox without missing a
message.
Flagging mail you’ve received
While you’re reading e-mail messages, you can flag a message — typi-
cally, so you can return to the message later. Microsoft calls these Quick
Flags, and that they are.
28
Technique

Marking Mail
213
1.
Click the flag icon in the right-most column of
the message list to flag the message with the
default color (probably red). Right-click the
flag icon to flag the message with a different
color.
In Figure 28-1, I flag a message as indigo . . . er,
purple . . . because it’s interesting to me. See
“Choosing Flag Colors” later in this Technique
for details on working with the colors that work
for you.
When you add the flag, Outlook assumes that
you want to follow up on the message later and
adds the message to the default For Follow Up
search folder.
• Figure 28-1: Right-click the flag icon to choose a colored
flag.
2.
Press the down arrow to go on to the next 
message.
You can add additional info to the flag if you want.
See “Tacking other information to a flag” later in this
Technique.
Flagging mail before you send it
You can flag a message before you send it by clicking
the red flag on the main toolbar in the message win-
dow (see Figure 28-2).
• Figure 28-2: The red flag in WordMail allows you to set
reminders for the message’s recipient.
When you click the flag, you get a dialog box that
enables you to add additional information for the
person you’re sending the message to, such as Do
Not Forward. See the next section for details.
Tacking other information to a flag
Outlook lets you hang a bunch of information on the
follow-up flag in the Flag for Follow Up dialog box,
shown in Figure 28-3. The dialog box springs onto
your screen if you

Right-click a flag in the right column of the Mail
list and then choose Add Reminder.

Click the flag icon on the toolbar of a message
you’re sending (refer to Figure 28-2).
• Figure 28-3: Set a reminder to yourself.
In the Flag To box, you can choose from Call, Do Not
Forward, Follow Up, For Your Information, Forward,
No Response Necessary, Read, Reply, Reply to All,
and Review. You can also set a date and time.
After you set a reminder, it shows up at the top of
the corresponding e-mail message (see Figure 28-4).

Technique 28: Organizing with Flags
214
• Figure 28-5: In true search folder style (see Technique 27),
For Follow Up lets you leaf through flagged
messages.
• Figure 28-6: Re-create the For Follow Up folder if you
lose it.
• Figure 28-4: The consequences of the settings in 
Figure 28-3.
You need to realize that setting a reminder in
this way does not create a Task, nor does it
create a Calendar entry or appointment. You
won’t receive notification that the e-mail
reminder comes due in 15 minutes. Instead,
after the due date and time pass, the color of
the flag changes to the default flag color —
probably red.
If you want to use a message as the basis for
an appointment, drag it onto the Calendar
icon in Outlook navigation pane’s shortcuts. If
you want to use it for a Task, drag it onto the
Tasks icon.
Following Up on Flags
When you’re ready to view all the e-mail messages
that currently have flags, click the For Follow Up
folder in the Favorite Folders part of the Mail naviga-
tion pane. (Read Technique 26 for more on these
Outlook features.) Outlook shows you the contents
of the For Follow Up search folder (see Figure 28-5).
You can customize the For Follow Up folder just like
any other search folder. See Technique 27 for details.
If you can’t find your For Follow Up folder, first
look in the All Mail Folders list. For Follow Up
should appear underneath the Search Folders
entry (folder). If you still can’t find it, choose
File➪New➪Search Folder. In the New Search
Folder dialog box (see Figure 28-6), choose
Mail Flagged for Follow Up and then click OK.

Moving the Flag Column
215
You aren’t restricted to viewing flagged mes-
sages by the color of their flags. To view them
by date, sender, or a dozen other criteria, click
Arranged By directly beneath the For Follow
Up header, and choose your preferred sort field.
Typically you flag messages in order to remind your-
self to follow up on them. Sooner or later, you have
to get some work done (at least theoretically), and in
spite of your best attempts, you might actually com-
plete the work associated with a message. In that
case, you should change the message’s flag to show
that it’s complete. To flag an item as complete, right-
click it and choose Flag Complete. When you do, the
For Follow Up folder no longer sees the message.
Choosing Flag Colors
Outlook lets you choose among six different colors
of flags. Unfortunately, that’s about as far as it goes:
You can’t tell Outlook that red means panic, blue
means cool, orange is for your cat, and indi . . . er,
purple is interesting. You have to make those deci-
sions for yourself, write them down on sticky notes,
and tack them on your computer. High tech.
One option you do have is the default color. Before
you go changing it, however, let me tell you why it’s
important:

It’s the fastest and easiest color to apply; just
click the flag, and it turns red.

When you go past your reminder date, the flag
changes to the default color (unless it already is
the default color).
Use flag colors to form the backbone of a quick,
rudimentary tracking system. If you normally
operate in panic mode (and I certainly fall into
that category), red (the universal color for
Hey!) is a great choice for your default. (It’s
the color that I want most often when I’m flag-
ging messages and what I want flags to turn to
when I miss a deadline.) You might want to
consider changing the default color, though,
for different flagging needs. For example,
maybe you want to flag your messages as
blue to indicate just starting. Presumably you
would change the color of the flag as the mes-
sage’s status changes. Remember: If you don’t
have a reminder date assigned to the mes-
sage, it never automatically changes back to
the default color. 
To set the default color, right-click any flag, choose
Set Default Flag, and pick the color.
Moving the Flag Column
The flag column at the right of the message list
exhibits one really irritating oddity: It’s locked to the
right edge there. You can move the other fields
around — drag them, resize them, and reverse their
order — but you can’t usurp the flag column from its
chosen position.
That is, unless you know the trick. To make the flag
column act like a normal message list column
1.
Right-click any of the fields at the top of the
Message list (From, Subject, Size, and so on)
and choose Customize Current View.
Outlook shows you the Customize View:
Messages dialog box (see Figure 28-7).
• Figure 28-7: Customize the Message list.

Technique 28: Organizing with Flags
216
5.
To add a flag status column, right-click any
field at the top of the message list, and choose
Field Chooser.
6.
From the Field Chooser dialog box (see Figure
28-9), click and drag Follow Up Flag onto the
list of fields.
Now you can move the column anywhere you
want.
• Figure 28-9: Drag the Follow Up Flag field to the
message list bar.
2.
Click the Other Settings button.
You see the Other Settings dialog box (see
Figure 28-8).
• Figure 28-8: Turn the follow-up flag into just another
field.
3.
Under Other Options, at the bottom of the dia-
log box, clear the Show Quick Flag Column
check box.
That unlocks the flag status column from the
right of the message list.
4.
Click OK twice.
The flag status column becomes a field on the
message list, just like any other field. Because
you changed its status, you now have to add it as
a field instead.

Taming
AutoComplete
in Outlook
M
y attorney’s name is John. A good friend of mine is named
John, too.
Not long ago, I wrote an e-mail message to John, my attorney, railing
about . . . well, let’s just say I wasn’t pleased with certain aspects of a, uh,
legal matter. I wasn’t angry with Attorney John, mind you, but I spewed
fire and venom about various embarrassing situations.
I typed John’s name in the To box of my Outlook e-mail message. You
probably guessed the punch line already.
Outlook sent the message to the other John, my friend John. No warning.
No hiccup. I’d sent mail to Attorney John by typing John in the To box a
hundred times before. But on this particular day Outlook, in its infinite
wisdom, decided that mail to Attorney John should go to Friend John.
Some days I want to kill Outlook.
Understanding AutoComplete
If you’ve used Outlook to write e-mail messages for more than a few days,
you undoubtedly know that there are two different, competing ways to
put an e-mail address in the To box:

Click the To button. When you do, Outlook brings up the Select Names
dialog box (see Figure 29-1). This is a clunky old dialog box (Microsoft
ran out of money again, I guess) that’s very hard to configure and use.
In particular, you see the list of names sorted by first name, you can’t
re-sort on the fly, and you only get four fields: Name, Display Name, 
E-mail Address, and E-mail Type.
You can coax Outlook into sorting in File As sequence — typically, last
name, first name — but only by applying considerable elbow grease.
See “Setting the Address Book Straight” later in this Technique for
details.

Technique 29: Taming AutoComplete in Outlook

• Figure 29-2: A resolved address, in the wedgie style.
Unfortunately, if you want to figure out
how to peacefully co-exist with Outlook’s
AutoComplete feature, you really need to
understand where Outlook goes to find
addresses.
As best as I can tell (Microsoft doesn’t document
this stuff), here’s how Outlook 2003 resolves what
you type in the To box:
The problem with AutoComplete is that it relies on
the Nickname cache, which is independent of the
Contacts list and relies on a history of addresses and
names that you’ve typed in the address boxes to
come up with entries such as the ones in Figure 29-3.
Although you can press Ctrl+K to go to the Contacts
list and select a name if Outlook can’t find a name in
the Nickname cache, everything that AutoComplete
does happens so fast that you can all too easily end
up with the wrong address in the Message. If the
address resolves incorrectly milliseconds before you
click the Send button, the message goes to the
wrong person, and you’ll never even know.
• Figure 29-3: Type w, and all the entries from the
Nickname Cache beginning with w
appear.
• Figure 29-1: Outlook offers slim pickin’s when you want
to put an e-mail address in a message.
Want to search for a Contact using anything
other than their name? Fuhgeddaboutit.
Neither the Type Name or Select from List
box at the top nor the Advanced➪Find option
will look for, say, a city name or an e-mail
address. To perform a real search, you have to
switch over to the Contacts application itself.

Start typing in the To box and see what
Outlook drags in. Outlook uses a complex series
of steps to try to resolve what you’ve typed into
a usable e-mail address. That is, it tries to be
helpful and guess whom you want, filling in the
address for you. If and/or when the address is
resolved, Outlook underlines it in the To box
(see Figure 29-2). Outlook uses the same method
for resolving addresses in the To box, the Cc box,
and the Bcc box.

Setting the Address Book Straight
219
AutoComplete in Outlook is a real mixed bag. It’s an
enormous timesaver, without any doubt. But Outlook’s
headlong dash to the exits when you click Send can
mean that you send the right message to the wrong
person.
Understand now, John?
Cleaning Up the Cache
In the preceding section, I show you the supremacy
of Outlook’s Nickname Cache. It’s a very helpful tool,
but it can bite you, too. The primary problem? The
Nickname Cache gets loaded with all sorts of
garbage. For example

Every time you send a message, the recipient’s
e-mail address gets added to Outlook’s Nickname
Cache.

Every time you reply to a message (or reply to
all, or forward), the recipient’s e-mail address
gets added to Outlook’s Nickname Cache.
There’s no Nickname Cache Sunshine Law. After an
address gets in there, Outlook keeps it forever —
unless you delete it. You can do so by deleting indi-
vidual entries or cleaning out the whole cache.
If (or when) AutoComplete starts spitting
out bad entries that you don’t want and that
get in the way, clean out the cache so that
AutoComplete starts working in your favor
again.

Want to delete unwanted entries from the
Nickname Cache? This is good when you know
of an entry or two that’s tripping you up all the
time and might one day cause you to acciden-
tally send mail to the wrong address. Type the
first letter or two of the bad name or address in
the To box, use the arrow keys to get to the
name, and then press Delete.
Note: If only one entry in the Nickname Cache is
showing, you can’t delete it! Microsoft’s com-
pletely bogus solution to this problem is at
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=289975.
Yep, you guessed it. Microsoft ran out of money
while fixing Outlook.

To start your Nickname Cache all over again:
That probably isn’t such a bad idea, especially
if you’ve been answering a lot of e-mail from peo-
ple whom you’ll never talk to again. To delete the
existing cache completely, simply delete the file
C:\Documents And Settings\<your username>\
Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\
Outlook.nk2.
Ditching AutoComplete Altogether
If Outlook’s AutoComplete really bugs you — and it might,
if you’ve been bitten a few times — you can turn it off.
However, I don’t recommend that you turn it off because
it’s such a great timesaver. Far better to come to grips with
the beast. But if you want to give it the heave-ho, here’s the
scoop:
1.
If you can’t see Mail, choose Go➪Mail.
2.
Choose Tools➪Options.
3.
Click E-mail Options.
4.
Click Advanced E-mail Options.
(Did I mention that this setting is buried deep?)
Outlook shows you the Advanced E-mail Options dia-
log box.
5.
Clear the Suggest Names While Completing To,
Cc, and Bcc Fields check boxes.
6.
Click OK three times.
Setting the Address
Book Straight
I tend to think of the Address Book — the place
where Outlook goes to look for addresses — and the
Outlook Contacts list as being pretty much the same

Technique 29: Taming AutoComplete in Outlook

This is one of the few times I’ve had problems
with Word interfering with Outlook (or, more pre-
cisely with Word interfering with WordMail —
Word running as Outlook’s e-mail editor). It’s
sporadic, and the simplest solution is to just
close down Word entirely.
2.
In Outlook, choose Go➪Folder List.
That lets you see all the folders in all your open
Outlook files.
3.
Right-click each Contacts folder, in turn, and
choose Properties➪Outlook Address Book.
You might have only one Contacts folder. That’s
fine. Outlook shows you the Contacts Properties
dialog box.
4.
Mark the Show This Folder as an E-mail
Address Book check box and then click OK.
That signals Windows that you have an E-mail
Address Book, here in this Contacts folder.
5.
Choose Tools➪E-mail Accounts.
Outlook shows you the E-mail Accounts Wizard.

that already.
If you’ve been using Outlook Express and you
have entries in your Windows Address Book,
you need to export them and bring them into
Outlook. In spite of the similarities in names,
an Outlook Express Windows Address Book
isn’t anything at all like an Outlook Address
Book — or a Contacts list, either, for that mat-
ter. To pull your addresses over, go into
Outlook, choose File➪Import and Export,
choose Import Internet Mail and Addresses,
click Next, and follow the wizard.
I’ve encountered two common time-sucking prob-
lems with Outlook Address Books.

Sometimes when you start a new e-mail message
and click the To button, you get a message from
Outlook that reads:
“The address list could not be displayed. The
Contacts folder associated with this address list
could not be opened; it may have been moved or
deleted, or you do not have permissions. For
information on how to remove this folder from
the Outlook Address Book, see Microsoft Office
Outlook Help.”
Help has a short ditty on removing Address
Books, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.

Sometimes I put up with scanning the list of
names/e-mail addresses (refer to Figure 29-1) by
first name, but usually I want to look at it in File
As order, which looks just like Figure 29-1 but
shows the names in alphabetical order. (After
all, that’s what File As is supposed to do, right?)
You can tell Outlook to show the list in File As
order — but it ain’t easy.
Here’s what you need to know:
1.
If Word is running, bring it up, choose
File➪Exit and get out of Word completely.

select the radio button for whether you want

(First Last) or by File As (typically last name,
first name).
I bet you find that scanning in File As order is
much, much faster than looking by First Name.

pam is the bane of my existence.
I get a lot of it — no doubt because my e-mail address adorns Web sites
from here to eternity.
My newsletters suffer because of spam, too. People complain when
they don’t get an issue because rogue spam blocking programs gobble
’em up. Some corporate spam-eaters don’t have the good sense to let
my newsletters through. Even Outlook 2003’s junk mail filter has been
known to misfire. Such is my life.
The effort to fight spam also causes problems when people you know get
new e-mail addresses:
Me: “Hi honey. How’s it going?”
Her: “Why didn’t you answer my e-mail?”
Me: “Huh? What e-mail?”
Her: “I just sent you something from my new ID at work.”
Me: (click, click, click, click of my mouse) “Oh. Here it is in my Junk

Be discreet. Never post your address on a Web
site or in a newsgroup. E-mail address-gathering
spiders go everywhere. If people have to get in
touch with you, based on something you posted
on the Web, use something that’s hard for a spi-
der to decipher: woody (at) wopr (dot) com or
talk 2 woody at woodyswatch . . . com.

Never respond to spam. Ever. You should
feel comfortable unsubscribing from mailing
lists from reputable companies. But if
DownInDaDirtBoomBoom.com sends you a mes-
sage with an unsubscribe button at the bottom,
fuhgeddaboutit. You can bet they’ll sell your
address to somebody else — and at a good-as-
gold price because you’ve verified that you read
the junk they sent.

Never open an attachment to an e-mail message.
Nope, not even if the message appears to come
from Microsoft or PayPal or Citibank (especially if
the message appears to come from Microsoft or
PayPal or Citibank). Reputable companies don’t
send files attached to messages any more. Before
you open an e-mail attachment, you need to con-
tact the person who sent the file to you and make
sure he intended to send it, save the file to disk,
scan it with your just-updated antivirus program,
and only then open the beast. See my detailed
advice on dealing with e-mail attachments in
Techniques 1 and 32.

Never trust a site that you arrive at via an e-mail
message link. (For that matter, you should be
cautious about clicking through from Web pages!)
If a message that looks like it came from PayPal
tells you to click a link to log on to PayPal, you
can bet your Aunt Louise’s El Dorado that the
link won’t go anywhere near PayPal. If you need
to log on to a Web site, find the site’s location
from an independent source.

Use disposable e-mail addresses. Spamex, among
others, offers a disposable e-mail address service
(www.spamex.com, free 30-day trial, $10 per year).
You get 500 e-mail addresses, which you can use in
any way you like. Cool factor: Keep track of who
gets what address, and you’ll be able to nail down
where spammers found your ID. If you start getting
too much spam, just move on to a new address.

Nuke Web beacons. Tell Outlook 2003 to block
automatic downloading of pictures inside e-mail
messages. That cuts off Web beacons — see the
sidebar, “What’s a Web Beacon?” — which are a
powerful way of gathering e-mail addresses.
Outlook 2003, right out of the box, blocks automatic
downloading of pictures (and certain other items,
including sounds) inside messages. Blocking pictures
makes good sense, and not just from a security point
of view. (See the sidebar, “What’s a Web Beacon?”)
By skipping the pictures, you can skim through your
e-mail faster, too, particularly if you don’t have a
hefty Internet connection (see Figure 30-1).
• Figure 30-1: Many e-mail newsletters are poorly
formatted for Outlook 2003, but you can
usually get the gist without the pics.
Even if you block pictures with this Outlook
setting, you will still see pictures in your
incoming e-mail! That’s a good thing. Really. If
someone puts a picture inside a message —
which is quite common if you, say, copy and
paste a picture into the body of a message
you’re typing — that picture goes through
Outlook 2003 and arrives on the other side,
no problem. Outlook’s picture blocking only
applies to messages that are trying to down-
load pictures (or sounds) from the Internet.

Technique 30: Dealing with Spam
224
Then, if you approve, it downloads the pictures
before continuing. (If you don’t approve,
Outlook refuses to reply, forward, or print.)
• Figure 30-3: Outlook won’t let you reply to, forward, or
print a message without downloading the
pics (or sounds).
4.
Mark the (hold your breath) Permit Downloads
in E-mail Messages from Senders and to
Recipients Defined in the Safe Senders and Safe
Recipients Lists Used by the Junk E-mail Filter
check box.
This incredibly obfuscating bit of text means that
if you receive a message and the e-mail address
of the sender is on your Safe Senders or Safe
Recipients list, the pictures (and sounds) in the
message should be downloaded automatically.
The easiest way to put an e-mail address or
domain such as woodyswatch.com on your
Safe Senders or Safe Recipients list is to right-
click a message from (or to) the address you
want to add, and choose Junk E-Mail➪Add
Sender (or Recipient) to Safe Senders List, as
in Figure 30-4.
• Figure 30-4: The fast way to add an address to your Safe
Senders or Recipients list.
To keep Outlook 2003 from reaching out to the
Internet and downloading pictures automatically
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Security.
2.
Under Download Pictures, click Change
Automatic Download Settings.
Outlook shows you the oddly worded Automatic
Picture Download Settings dialog box in Figure
30-2.
• Figure 30-2: If you really need the pictures, they’re just a
click away.
3.
Mark the Don’t Download Pictures or Other
Content Automatically in HTML E-mail check
box.
That prevents Outlook 2003 from downloading
pictures (or sounds) referenced from inside the
message when you view a message in the reading
pane, or when you double-click a message and
open it for real. (There are two exceptions; see
Steps 4 and 5.)
If you block pictures and then reply to a mes-
sage, forward it, or print it, Outlook 2003
shows you the dialog box in Figure 30-3.

Employing an Ounce of Prevention
225
Anybody in your Contacts list (or global
Address Book, if you’re on a big corporate net-
work) is automatically included in the Safe
Senders List.
Because it’s very easy to spoof a message’s
return address — make it appear as if, oh,
Microsoft sent you the message, or PayPal, or
even Woody Leonhard — you should use this fea-
ture with some care and discernment.
Many pieces of spam these days appear to
originate from the same person who received
the spam. I call it Mini-Me-spoofing. For that
reason, you should not put your own e-mail
address on the Safe Senders or Safe Recipients
list, and you shouldn’t put your e-mail address
in your own Contacts list!
5.
Mark the Permit Downloads from Web Sites in
This Security Zone: Trusted Zone check box.
Why the weird wording? Because your network
administrator (if you have one) can change
Trusted Zone to Trusted Zone, Local Intranet Zone,
Internet Zone. If you enable this check box,
Outlook 2003 downloads only those pictures
(and sounds) that are stored on Web sites in
your Trusted Zone. The setting has nothing to do
with the e-mail address of the sender.
6.
Click OK twice.
Any time you want to see a blocked picture, click
at the top of the message or right-click an indi-
vidual picture.
To understand precisely why you want to keep
Outlook from automatically downloading pictures
(and sounds) from the Web, see the sidebar, “What’s
a Web Beacon?” But don’t fall for the revisionist
history. Microsoft itself used to use Web beacons
(see Figure 30-5). (See www.internetnews.com/
IAR/article.php/12_584741 among many others.)
And the company refused to put any meaningful
spam protection into any version of Outlook prior
to Outlook 2003.
• Figure 30-5: Comments like this make me see red.
A contrarian view. Although Web beacons, in theory,
are potentially quite powerful, there’s been very lit-
tle concrete evidence that they lead to increased
spamming. In fact, Brian Livingston, in his e-book
Spam-Proof Your E-mail Address ($9.95 from
http://briansbuzz.com), comes to the conclusion
that 97 percent of all spam is aimed at e-mail
addresses posted on the Internet and that Web bea-
cons really don’t matter at all. He might be right. 
If you’re willing to accept Brian’s position and you
have a fast Internet connection, you might well want
to allow Outlook 2003 to download pictures for all
e-mail messages. The downloading doesn’t occur
until you see the message in the reading pane (or
open the message, which few people do nowadays),
so you won’t have zillions of spammy pictures float-
ing around in Outlook’s files.

Technique 30: Dealing with Spam
226
When you tell Outlook to block pictures in
e-mail messages, Outlook Help refuses to
download pictures in Help topics, and Web sites
referenced by Help (including demos) don’t get
any pictures, either. This is probably a bug.
Deploying a Pound of Cure
Okay, so you’re on so many spam lists that your
e-mail address gets spray-painted on New York
subways. What can you do?

Set Outlook 2003’s junk mail filter to High and
scan your Junk E-mail folder religiously.

Change your e-mail address, although I see this
option as a last resort.

Install a different kind of spam filter (a Bayesian
filter) from a manufacturer other than Microsoft.
Although you can train these filters to reflect
what you think is and isn’t spam, these filters
probably won’t be worth the considerable
expense, both in time and money.
Junk mail (or spam) filters, in Outlook or from
another source, strive to minimize two kinds
of mistakes: false negatives and false positives.
False negatives are cases where junk slips through
into the Inbox. They’re kind of a pain in the neck, but
rarely do any harm — you just have to delete the
message to get rid of a false negative.
False positives are a different story altogether. With a
false positive, the junk mail filter inaccurately identi-
fies a good message as being junk, discarding it to
the Junk E-mail folder.
If you get a lot of junk (and I do), false posi-
tives can ruin your day, week, month — or
your business.
What’s a Web Beacon?
You have two ways to put pictures inside e-mail messages.
Most of the time, you simply copy the picture into the mes-
sage and let Outlook sort it all out on the recipients’ end.
But you can also put a link to a picture inside a message,
using a code that looks something like this:
<IMG SRC= “http://cheapcheapills.com/
somepic.gif”>.
When Outlook sees a code like that, it knows that it needs
to reach out to cheapcheapills.com and pick up the pic-
ture called somepic.gif. Using a link makes the message
much smaller, and that’s what spammers (and legitimate
newsletter publishers, such as yours truly!) like: We don’t
have to send out zillions of huge messages, all containing
the same image, over and over and over again. Sending
out a lot of large e-mail messages costs a fortune. Using
links costs comparatively little.
Unfortunately, linked pictures can be used by unscrupulous
companies to determine whether a specific e-mail message
has been viewed. Here’s how. The company buys a list of
e-mail addresses. (You can buy millions and millions of raw
e-mail addresses — most of them useless — for a fistful of
yen.) A program then generates unique ID keys for each
e-mail address. For example, my address, woody@wopr.com,
might come up with the key ABYoAEhouX. The company
then sends a message to woody@wopr.com with a link to a
picture that looks like this:
<IMG SRC= “http://cheapcheapills.com/
cgi-bin/flosensing?x=ABYoAEhouX”>
When I get the message, and if Outlook is allowed to pull
down pictures, it goes to the Web site cheapcheapills.com
and asks for the picture called flosensing?x=ABYoAEhouX.
The Web site is smart enough to match up the key with
my e-mail address before returning the picture. So the
unscrupulous company can verify that the message sent to
woody@wopr.com was in fact viewed — and that means the
e-mail address is good and ready to be spammed.

Deploying a Pound of Cure
227
With Outlook’s Junk E-mail filter, you can deal with
false negatives and false positives in one of two ways:

If you run the Junk E-mail filter at Low, you need
to scan all the messages in your Inbox and delete
the junk (false negatives) accordingly. Then you
need to scan all the messages in your Junk E-mail
folder to see whether the filter misdirected any-
thing (look for false positives).
If you find a message in the Junk E-mail Folder
that should be in your Inbox, right-click it and
choose Junk E-mail➪Mark as Not Junk➪OK.
Outlook will place it in the Inbox.

Likewise, if you run the Junk E-mail filter at High,
you need to scan all the messages in your Inbox
and delete the junk accordingly. Then you need to
scan all the messages in your Junk E-mail folder
to see whether the filter misdirected anything.
See a pattern here? Hear the echo?
With the filter on Low, you delete junk mes-
sages many, many times while working on
your Inbox, but you almost never find
misidentified mail in your Junk E-mail folder.
On High, you go through your Junk E-mail
folder, right-clicking and choosing Junk 
E-mail➪Mark as Not Junk➪OK many times.
But you only manually delete a few times in
your Inbox. In my experience, you save a lot
of time if you can live with the High setting.
To set Outlook 2003’s junk mail filter
1.
Choose Tools➪Options.
2.
On the Preferences tab, click the first button
(Junk E-mail).
You see the Junk E-mail Options dialog box, as
shown in Figure 30-6.
3.
Select the radio button that begins with High.
(Trust me, the whole name is way too long.)
A complete description of the options and their
timesaving implications is in Table 30-1.
4.
Make sure that you do NOT enable the
Permanently Delete Suspected Junk E-mail
Instead of Moving It to the Junk E-mail Folder
check box.
This might be the most foolish option in all of
Office.
5.
Click OK twice.
• Figure 30-6: Set Outlook’s spam-filtering level here.
Some industry pundits would have you start at
Low and then move to High after a week or
two. However, because the Outlook filter
doesn’t learn, I don’t see any benefit in telling
people to start at Low and then move to High.

Technique 30: Dealing with Spam
228
one researcher who claims that the presence of bold
red text in a message is a better indicator of spammi-
ness than the presence of certain, uh, four-letter
words.
Ultimately, the best solution is to make spamming
simply not worth the effort. Please. Don’t ever
respond to spam. If you really want to buy an amaz-
ing remote-controlled mini-cam that increases the
size of your pineal gland and takes off all that horri-
ble sagging cellulite in one week or triple your
money back, hop onto one of the Web search
engines and find something better.
Please.
Which brings me to the primary complaint about the
Outlook 2003 junk mail filter: It doesn’t learn from
your settings and actions, and you can’t train it to
recognize your particular likes and dislikes — or pre-
cisely what you consider to be spam.
The Outlook 2003 spam filter has some capabilities
that aren’t built into any Bayesian filter that I’ve
seen. For example, the Outlook filter takes into
account the domain of the sender (spam rarely
comes from .edu addresses), the presence of attach-
ments (most traditional spam doesn’t have attach-
ments, but that might be changing), and the time of
day the mail gets sent (most spam goes out at night).
Both Bayesian and Outlook filters take into account
formatting in the messages. I was surprised to find

Preventing
Infection
T
his Technique differs from all the other Techniques. My goal: to
improve the sensitivity of your internal BS meter.
Many of the most famous — and most effective — worms and viruses on
the Internet slithered their way into the record books by effective human
engineering. Some convinced you to click an attachment that read
ILOVEYOU or contained a picture of a sexy tennis star. Others convinced
you to run an attachment with the latest Windows patch. One got you to
sign onto a Web site to update your PayPal account. And all were bogus.
Increasingly, the biggest threats on the Web are coming from two differ-
ent directions: the high-tech stuff that goes whizzing around without you
having to lift a finger; and the down-home stuff that convinces you to
click something when you know you shouldn’t. We have to rely on others
to protect us from the former. But for the latter, if you get scammed or
infected, you have only yourself to blame.
Understanding the Classic Hooks
Viruses, worms, and other creepy-crawlies (which I shall call malware)
have long traveled attached to e-mail messages:

Melissa (March, 1999) was the first macro virus that hooked into
Outlook. If you opened a Melissa-infected document in Word, copies of
Melissa went out to everyone in your Contacts list.

Bubbleboy (November, 1999) and its more prolific soul mate, Kak,
were the first viruses that propagated simply by previewing an e-mail
message. You didn’t even have to open the message — and there was
no attachment: The virus did all the work silently.

ILOVEYOU (Love Letter; May, 2000) brought down Microsoft’s e-mail
servers as well as a large percentage of all the major computer sites in
the world. People couldn’t keep themselves from double-clicking the
file called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs attached to a message with

Technique 31: Preventing Infection
230
A surprisingly large number of people — a distress-
ingly large number of people — double-clicked the
attachment to the message in Figure 31-1. Note the
message about the patch.exe attachment under the
toolbar.
• Figure 31-1: Beware dangerous viruses on the Internet!
If you’re running Outlook 2003 and you haven’t
installed Ken Slovak’s ATTOPT utility (see Technique
32), you can’t even get at the attached file,
patch.exe. That’s good. But in spite of the fact that
the person who wrote this piece of malware proba-
bly has an IQ approaching room temperature —
Celsius — the bad guys are going to get smarter.
In the particular, the person who wrote the
malware in Figure 31-1 only needs to zip the
patch.exe file prior to attaching it to the mes-
sage, and it’ll go right through Outlook,
directly onto your desktop. Instead of double-
clicking to get infected, you have to double-
click twice and answer a couple of warning
messages.
By the way, that message in Figure 31-1 made it right
past Outlook 2003’s spam filter. No problem. The bad
guys are going to get smarter about that, too.
Very few companies ever send files attached
to e-mail messages any more, specifically
because of all the problems with malware. If
you receive a patch file from Microsoft
attached to an e-mail message, you can be
absolutely sure that you, uh, didn’t receive a
patch file from Microsoft (see Figure 31-2).
the subject ILOVEYOU. Of course, the .vbs exten-
sion is a dead giveaway that the attachment was
a program — if you can see it. See Technique 1.

Anna Kournikova (January, 2001) apparently
came from a script kiddie — someone who used a
virus-building kit downloaded from the Internet.
This represents a new low, both in terms of the
difficulty in creating a virus and in the security-
consciousness of those who got bit.

Nimda (September, 2001) is an all-but-the-kitchen-
sink piece of malware that infects in a half-dozen
different ways. Among them, it attaches itself to
an e-mail message, masquerading as a piece of
music. On some systems, Outlook would play the
music automatically when previewing the mes-
sage, thus infecting the machine. Nimda looks
everywhere — absolutely everywhere — on your
computer to harvest e-mail addresses.

Klez (February, 2002) had many of the same
annoying characteristics as Nimda, but it
included one that drove many Outlook users
nuts: Klez spoofs the From e-mail address, pick-
ing up a random e-mail address from the infected
computer. A spoofed message might look like it
came from your Mom, but it didn’t.

Starting with Slammer (January, 2003), the enor-
mously destructive pieces of malware shifted
from propagation by attachment to e-mail mes-
sages toward direct infection via holes in
Windows and various kinds of servers.
We’re now in an era where most of the malware-
writing “talent” (I shudder to use a term like that)
looks more toward bringing down the Internet in the
first ten minutes of a worm’s life and less toward
infecting individuals’ machines.
As Microsoft gradually — some say far too
gradually — plugs the holes in Outlook and
Internet Explorer (in the past, IE frequently
helped Outlook infect machines), old-fashioned
malware writers are turning toward social
engineering — telling a convincing story — to
entice you to click something you normally
wouldn’t. That’s where your internal BS meter
comes into play.

Phishing for Fun and Profit
231
• Figure 31-2: One guess which company did not send out
this message.
Follow the steps in Technique 32 to make
Outlook 2003 show you all the files attached
to your messages. But use some common
sense. The time is coming when malware writ-
ers will be smart enough to bypass the secu-
rity traps in Outlook 2003. When that time
comes, the presence of a Zip file attached to
an e-mail message could well be a warning
that the attachment is infected. Beware!
Phishing for Fun and Profit
As the focus for serious malware writers shifts away
from Outlook, the scam artists come rushing in.
Stumbling all over themselves, in fact.
Enter phishing, the (ahem) technical term for send-
ing out e-mail messages — generally spam — that
attempt to extract valuable information from recipi-
ents: credit card numbers, financial and shopping
site passwords, and the like. It’s a lucrative business,
and it’s going to get bigger.
Part of the problem is that a well-crafted phishing
message (such as the one in Figure 31-3) can get
through Outlook 2003’s junk mail filter.
• Figure 31-3: Reasonably articulate phishing messages can
get through Outlook 2003’s spam filter.
Another part of the problem: If the phisher (for want
of a better term) is willing to pay for a little extra
bandwidth, he can include official-looking pictures
with his messages, like the one in Figure 31-4.
• Figure 31-4: An official notice from Citibank — which, of
course, isn’t from Citibank.

Technique 31: Preventing Infection
232
Safeguarding against attachments
Before you double-click any file attached to an e-mail
message
1.
Contact the person who sent you the file and
make sure that she intended to send it.
You can reply to the incoming message.
Attachments aren’t activated, opened, or run
when you reply.
2.
Judge for yourself whether the sender is
computer-savvy enough to avoid sending
infected files.
3.
Save the file to disk — never open it directly
from the message.
You could save it someplace convenient on your
hard drive, but it’s best to avoid places like your
desktop, where you could double-click the file
accidentally.
4.
Update your antivirus software and scan the
file manually before opening it.
See Technique 32 for more about working with
attachments.
Keeping phishers at bay
If you receive a message saying that your account is
overdue or expiring, or you’re going on a long
extended holiday, use some simple, common-sense
precautions:

Don’t click any attachments, even if they look
official or innocuous.
Phishing and malware go hand-in-hand in
exploits like Mimail, which contains a virus that
replicates the phishing message.
The phishing message in Figure 31-4 looks very, very
much like a Citibank missive — logo and all. The lan-
guage would never make it past a Citibank proof-
reader (“We are letting you know, that you, as a
Citibank checking account holder, must become
acquainted with our new Terms & Conditions and
agree to it. . . . We are sorry for any inconvinience it
may cause.”), but if you glance at the message and
don’t read it carefully, you’ll be very tempted to click
through.
The supposed Citibank Web site you are sent to
(which looks mighty professional, too!) only gathers
your e-mail address in order to confirm that you
viewed and clicked the message that was sent to
you. The no-goodniks were phishing for your e-mail
address. Fortunately, the site was closed down
shortly after the messages came out. I checked the
Web address with the official registry (whois.net)
and found that the company was registered to
Hangzhou Silk Road Information Technologies Co.,
Ltd. in China.
If you’re curious about who’s behind a poten-
tially nasty link in an email message, don’t
click it. Hover your mouse over the link and
wait until Outlook shows you the address.
Copy the domain name and hop over to
whois.net. Although WHOIS doesn’t have all
the domain names all over the world on file, if
you start there, you can almost always find the
registered owner of the domain.
Taking the Necessary
Precautions
The preceding sections make you aware of what
you’re up against, and this section explains the best
ways to respond to attachments, spoofs, phishers,
and their slimeball brethren.

Taking the Necessary Precautions
233

Don’t click through from the message onto the
Web.
Either pick up the phone and call the company
or use Internet Explorer to go to the company’s
Web site.

Don’t give out any information — not even
your account number or name — unless you
contact the company directly.
If you initiate the contact — either by calling a
telephone number that you found in the phone
book or by going to the company’s Web site
through a search engine — you’re safe.

If it smells, uh, phishy, it probably is. Notify the
company being ripped off immediately. Don’t
try to trace down the culprit by clicking
through.
Historically, there have been ways to infect PCs
directly from Web pages. The last thing you need
is to discover that someone has found a new
way.

Send a copy of the message to the Feds by for-
warding it to uce@ftc.gov. And if you think
somebody is zooming you, zoom him back at

Working with 
E-mail Attachments
T
his Technique is all about unraveling some of the safety nets that
Microsoft built into Outlook 2003. Straight out of the box, Outlook
2003 prevents you from getting at certain kinds of files that arrive
attached to e-mail messages. Unless you change things, many files that
people send you are blocked by Outlook, and you can spend a huge
amount of time trying to get at a file that should’ve come through the
first time.
In this Technique, I show you how to override Outlook’s default settings.
It’ll save you time — but you must have the discipline to avoid double-
clicking potentially dangerous files!
Before you dig into this Technique, make sure that you and your settings
are ready for it:

If you can’t train your clicking finger to avoid clicking e-mail attach-
ments, skip this Technique. See Technique 31 for tips on what to do
instead of clicking away.

If you haven’t told Windows to show you filename extensions, follow
the steps in Technique 1 and then come back to this Technique. (Or if
you doubt the need to see filename extensions, skip this Technique
altogether because without extensions showing, you’ll only invite
viruses into your computer).
I figure I just lost about 25 percent of you fair readers as well as 90 per-
cent of the brass at Microsoft. Fair enough.
Understanding Draconian Blocks
Outlook 2003 (and Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2000 Service Pack 3 or
later) keeps you from getting at certain files attached to incoming e-mail
messages. The intent is to keep you from getting infected. The actual
effect is to slow file transfer down to an infuriating snail’s pace.
32
Technique

Understanding Draconian Blocks
235
It’s for your own good. But it’s awfully heavy-handed.
I use the term draconian, and I believe that’s accurate.
Here’s how the blocking happens:
1.
Before Outlook shows a message in the reading
pane or opens it, Outlook examines it to see
whether it has a file attached.
2.
Outlook compares the filename extension on
any attached files with the so-called Level 1 list
(see Table 32-1).
There’s absolutely no intelligence involved:
no scanning for viruses, and no comparison
with known infected files. Outlook simply
compares the filename extension with the
Level 1 list.
3.
If the filename extension appears on the Level
1 list, Outlook tells you that it “blocked access
to the following potentially unsafe attach-
ments” (see Figure 32-1), and then it gives you
the name of the file.
The specific message in Figure 32-1 was created
by a worm called Dumaru, which was a key log-
ger that circulated widely in 2003 and 2004. If you
double-click the attached file, Dumaru plants a
program on your PC that records every key you
press and sends that information to a Web site. It
also scans most files on your PC, searching for
e-mail addresses and then mailing a copy of itself
to every address that it finds. Dumaru has its
own SMTP engine, which means that it can send
mail without using Outlook or any other e-mail
program.
4.
Outlook won’t let you get at the blocked file, no
way, no how. You can’t save it. You can’t for-
ward it. You can’t do anything with it.
Unless you use ATTOPT. See the following sec-
tion for details.
• Figure 32-1: patch.exe has a Level 1 filename extension.
As of this writing, all the Level 1 lists in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base and the Microsoft
Office Resource Kit are incorrect. Table 32-1 is
correct.
Cynics (present company most certainly included)
note that

Outlook doesn’t try to block .doc (Word docu-
ment), .xls (Excel spreadsheet), or .ppt
(PowerPoint) files. Why? Those kinds of files
certainly can harbor viruses and other kinds of
malware. Is it possible that MS didn’t put them
on the banned list because users would scream if
they couldn’t send documents or spreadsheets
to each other? And why are Access databases
blocked when docs aren’t?

Outlook only looks at the filename extension.
For example, you can easily and successfully
send an .exe file attached to an e-mail message
just by renaming it before you send it. You could
call the offensive file .exeremoveme or .exeee —
but if it’s named .exe, it won’t pass muster.

Zip files aren’t banned. You can send a virus
inside a .zip file, and Outlook will never be the
wiser.

SharePoint Portal Server lets you post any kind
of file. Outlook doesn’t care about the file or the
filename extension — even if you use Outlook to
post the file!

Bypassing the Blocks
237
If somebody sends you a file and it’s blocked by
Outlook, you have four options.

Write to the person who sent the file and ask her
to zip it and resend it.

Write to the person who sent the file and ask her
to rename the file with a filename extension that
isn’t on the Level 1 list — and then resend it.

Write to the person who sent the file and ask her
to either put it on a network share or in a
SharePoint portal that you can both get to.

Install Ken Slovak’s ATTOPT utility. (See the fol-
lowing section.)
If you want to save time, Ken’s utility is the only way
to go.
Bypassing the Blocks
Microsoft won’t let you completely free the Level 1
files that I describe in the preceding section, but it
does let you move them to Level 2. (Doncha just
love this descriptive terminology?) A file with a
Level 2 filename extension is still trapped by
Outlook, but you’re allowed to save the file onto
your hard drive (see Figure 32-2). From that point,
you can do what you will — presumably scanning
the file would be your first order of business.
• Figure 32-2: A filename extension on the Level 2 list
elicits an Outlook response like this.
The file in Figure 32-2, patch.exe, is the
same file that’s attached to the message in
Figure 32-1. It triggered the warning in Figure
32-2 after I moved .exe files to Level 2.
So how do you move Level 1 filename extensions to
Level 2?
You can do it the hard way by manually editing some
very strange keys in the Registry (details at
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid= 829982). Or
you can download the free (donation requested)
Attachment Options utility from Ken Slovak.
ATTOPT is a crucial, must-have download for
any Office 2003 user who wants to save time —
and has the discipline not to run programs
that come in from the Internet without scan-
ning them first.
To install and use ATTOPT
1.
Choose File➪Exit to get out of Outlook.
2.
Go to Ken’s Web site at www.slovaktech.com/
attachmentoptions.htm.
3.
At the bottom of the page, click the Download
Attachment Options link and save the setup file
AOsetup.exe to disk.
4.
Double-click AOsetup.exe.
The installer takes you through the steps.
5.
Start Outlook again. Choose Tools➪Options➪
Attachment Security & Options.
You see the Attachment Security & Options tab of
the Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 32-3.
6.
If you want to hunt and peck through the file-
name extensions, by all means, go ahead.
However, I recommend that you click the Move
All button and move every filename extension
from Level 1 to Level 2.

Technique 32: Working with E-mail Attachments
238
Yes, you have to be careful. Yes, you should
scan every single file that comes in attached
to an e-mail message with antivirus software.
But at least at Level 2, you have a choice.
If you can’t get Ken’s utility to work, it’s possi-
ble that your network administrator has locked
you out of the Level 1/Level 2 part of the
Registry. (Outlook has an installation setting
that allows this.) You’ll have to get permission
from your network admin. Good luck.
After you restart Outlook, messages with attached
files that used to be on the Level 1 list look like
Figure 32-4. You can get at the attached file.
• Figure 32-4: The same message as Figure 32-1, after
.exe has been moved from Level 1 to
Level 2.
• Figure 32-3: Move filename extensions from Level 1 to
Level 2.
7.
Click OK and then restart Outlook.
If you try to open a file attached to a message
with a filename extension on the Level 2 list, you
get a warning message like that in Figure 32-2.

Securing Your Mail
I
f the National Security Agency wants to crack one of your messages, it
can. It might need an hour on a supercomputer, but it can be done. On
the other hand, if you send out messages that you don’t want every
Tom, Dick, and Harry to read, encrypting — scrambling the message — is
a very good, surprisingly quick option.
Your e-mail messages are broken into packets, and anybody who can
read the packets can reassemble the messages, even changing the mes-
sages while en route, much like slathering correction fluid on a postcard.
By encrypting the message before you send it, each packet contains a
piece of the scrambled puzzle. Reuniting the packets is comparatively
easy. Unscrambling the message isn’t.
In this Technique, I show you how to encrypt your messages as well
as how to digitally sign messages so that the person who receives the
message can be reasonably confident that you sent it. They both go
hand-in-hand.
Save time. Save gray hair. Encrypt when it makes sense.
Getting a Digital Certificate
To a first approximation, a digital certificate resembles an electronic
passport or identity card. You can use a digital certificate to

Tell the recipient of an e-mail message that you sent the message. In
this case, only you — the sender — need a certificate.

Encrypt a message so that only the intended recipient can read it (give
or take a crack on a supercomputer). In this case, both the sender and
the recipient need digital certificates.
Digital certificates work very well with Outlook, and they aren’t depend-
ent on any other software. If you send and receive e-mail with Outlook,
you have everything that you need to encrypt and decrypt messages.

used widely on the Internet. Details are available
at http://rsasecurity.com.) Ultimately, you are
asked to check your e-mail for the Digital ID.

In the message, click the link that says To
Continue With the Installation of Your Digital
ID Click on the Continue Button and follow the
instructions onscreen.
Specifically, click Install, click OK twice, and then
the cert (that’s in-the-know cool talk for a digital
certificate) gets installed. 
As your free 60-day trial nears an end, VeriSign sends
you a message telling you how to switch to the paid
version.
Using a Digital Certificate
Your freshly minted digital certificate will identify you
to people who receive your messages, but the preced-
ing section should make you well aware of two facts:

Anybody can request, and receive, a Class 1 digital
certificate with any name on it. The fact that you
receive a message digitally signed by Bill Gates
should give you pause — not because it came
from the world’s richest person, but because it
came from someone with the chutzpah to apply
for a cert with Bill’s name on it.

Despite efforts for years, Microsoft hasn’t ironed
out the kinks in digital signatures. 
Although a person receiving a Class 1 digitally
signed message can’t be sure of the sender’s
identity, he can be sure that the message hasn’t
been tampered with. The certificate guarantees
that what you got is what was sent.
Most people attach signatures to messages only
occasionally. To digitally sign a particular message
1.
In Outlook, create the message normally.
2.
On the main toolbar, click the Options button
(see Figure 33-4).
You see the Message Options dialog box.

At the top of the Message Options dialog box,
click Security Settings.
Outlook shows you the Security Properties dia-
log box (see Figure 33-5).
4.
Select the Add Digital Signature to This
Message check box. Click OK and then click
Close.
Note the slight change in terminology. Digital sig-
nature here is the same thing as digital certificate
and Digital ID.

Technique 33: Securing Your Mail
242
Encrypting Messages
Before you can encrypt (intentionally scramble) a
message, both you and the person to whom you send
encrypted messages must follow all the steps in the
two preceding sections. You must both obtain and
install a digital certificate, and your correspondent
must send at least one digitally certified message to
you. It all has to do with public key encryption: You
have to receive his public key from him before
Outlook can combine it with your private key and
scramble the message. The best description I’ve seen
of public key cryptology is at www.howstuffworks.
com/encryption1.htm. It ain’t perfect, but it’s pretty
good.
To send an encrypted message, you must first put
your correspondent’s digital certificate in that per-
son’s record in your Contacts list. You need to do
that but once. Here’s how:
1.
Make sure that you have a digital certificate
installed.
2.
Have the person to whom you’re going to send
an encrypted message (your correspondent)
send you a message with a digital certificate.
Your correspondent has to follow all the steps
in the two preceding sections.
3.
When you receive the message from your cor-
respondent, right-click the name in the reading
pane and then choose Add to Outlook Contacts.
You see his Contact record.
4.
On the Contact record, click the Save and Close
button.
You might receive a Duplicate Contact Detected
message. If you do, select the Update New
Information from This Contact to the Existing
One radio button and then click OK.
5.
Send the message normally.
Outlook warns you that something is trying to
use your digital certificate.
Don’t be confused. Private Exchange Key and
CryptoAPI Private Key are the same as digi-
tal signature, digital certificate, and digital ID
earlier in this Technique. Microsoft’s terminol-
ogy runs all over the place.
6.
Click OK.
The message goes in the Outbox, as usual.
When you receive a message with a digital certifi-
cate, you can identify it by its gold-and-red ribbon,
both on the message in the message list and at the
upper-right of the reading pane (see Figure 33-6).
• Figure 33-6: A signed message.
If you want to see the details of the certificate itself
(which are rarely of any interest, at least for a Class
1 ID), you can click the gold-and-red ribbon (see
Figure 33-7).
• Figure 33-7: The digital certificate is good, although you
really don’t know who sent the message.

Encrypting Messages
243
At this point, your correspondent’s digital certificate
is stored in his record in Outlook’s Contacts.
After your Contact has a digital certificate safely
stored away, you can easily send an encrypted mes-
sage to him:
1.
Create a new message and write it normally.
2.
On the main toolbar, click the Options button
(refer to Figure 33-4).
Outlook shows you the Message Options dialog
box.
3.
At the top of the Message Options dialog box,
click Security Settings.
You get the Security Properties dialog box (see
Figure 33-8).
• Figure 33-8: Encrypt the message here.
4.
Select the Encrypt Message Contents and
Attachments check box. Click OK and then
click Close.
5.
Send the message normally.
Outlook warns you that something is trying to
use your digital certificate.
6.
Click OK.
The message goes in the Outbox, as usual.
When you receive an encrypted message, only a
warning appears in the reading pane (see Figure 33-9).
• Figure 33-9: You can’t preview an encrypted message —
and it thus won’t show up in the reading
pane.
To see the message, you have to double-click it in
the message list. When you do so, you see a warning
about a program trying to access your digital certifi-
cate. Click OK, and the message appears with a blue
lock signifying that it was encrypted (see the lower-
right corner Figure 33-10).
• Figure 33-10: An encrypted message bears a lock. 


Part IV
Exploiting Excel

Getting Excel
Settings Right
I
won’t mince words about it. Excel drives me nuts. I live in a Word/
Outlook world. Numbers kind of come along for the ride — yes, I
confess I was a math major, and I know that a standard deviation isn’t 
a guest on Jerry Springer. But my world doesn’t revolve around spread-
sheets. I use Excel to keep my business going, make investment decisions,
keep track of taxes, and lots of other stuff. But my day doesn’t start with
spreadsheets. Alas, often it does end that way. If you know what I mean.
If you’re like me, you want to get into Excel, get your numbers figured out,
and scoot — in time to go home for dinner. That’s where this Technique
comes in.
Bagging the Bouncing Menus
Excel, like most of the other Office 2003 applications, has an annoying
habit of moving your menus around. Today, you find Replace on the Edit
menu. Tomorrow, it’s gone, and Delete Sheet appears in its stead. You
have to double-click or hover your mouse around a menu to get it to
appear in its full splendor.
Microsoft calls them personal menus. I call them time-sucking fluff as well
as other, less printable things. To make your menus stand up and take
their punishment without cowering
1.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Options.
Excel shows you the Options tab of the Customize dialog box, as
shown in Figure 34-1.
2.
Mark the Always Show Full Menus check box.
3.
While you’re here, select the Show Standard and Formatting
Toolbars on Two Rows check box, too.

I s’pose. Or maybe Microsoft just ran out of
money again.) You can modify the Registry to
increase the number of undo levels, but
Microsoft sternly recommends that you not
allow more than 100 undo’s.

Maximize the number of files remembered on
the File menu. The so-called MRU (Most Recently
Used) list shows your most-recently opened files
at the bottom of the File menu. It starts at four.
There’s no penalty at all in increasing it to nine.

Make more AutoRecover saves. Excel 2003 auto-
matically saves an AutoRecover file — to recover
from crashes — every ten minutes. If you work
with excruciatingly huge spreadsheets, you
might want to leave that setting at ten minutes
because a save can take a long time. If you work
with spreadsheets that encompass something
less than the national debt, get Excel to spin a
safety net more frequently.

Don’t let Excel automatically convert Web
addresses and e-mail addresses to links. This is
a bit of IntelliNONsense borrowed from Word. I
talk about it in Technique 15.

Show page breaks all the time. Maybe you’re
disciplined enough to run a print preview every
time you change a spreadsheet, but I’m not —
and I have a dumpster full of misprinted pages to
prove it. Excel can show you the dotted-line page
break indicators all the time if you simply tell it.
In addition, I have three pet changes that I always
make. You can take ’em or leave ’em, but I find each
quite valuable:

Change how Enter works. When you type some-
thing in a cell and press Enter, Excel usually
moves to the cell below the one that you’re
working on. I rarely want to go down one cell.
I’ve played with this for years and come to the
conclusion that if I want to move to a new cell,
I can use the arrow keys. I prefer to have Enter just
accept what I typed and stay at the current cell.
• Figure 34-1: Get your full menus back.
4.
Click Close.
Aside from a persistent, ineffectual startup task
pane (which I dispatch in the next section), Excel
is ready to use.
Making Key Changes
Unlike Word — which abounds with spectacularly
ridiculous default settings — many of the changes
that Excel guri make to their systems have more to do
with personal preference than spiritual realignment.
Almost everyone who uses Excel exhaustively
agrees on a small handful of changes:

Increase the number of undo levels. Excel 2003,
out of the box, allows you to undo only your pre-
ceding 16 actions. It’s ludicrous, but Microsoft
insists that this limitation exists to protect you
from using too much memory! (These guys have
never heard of 512MB machines and swap files,

Making Key Changes
249
You have the potential to save a lot of time
here, particularly if you start using the number
pad on your keyboard. A second Enter key is
right there next to the numbers — and the
arrow keys sit waaaaay over in the lower back
40. (Or down in Soho if you’re a city girl.) Pay
attention to how you normally enter data, fig-
uring out whether it’s best for you to have
Excel stay put, move down, or move right (the
three most common choices) when you press
Enter.

Get rid of the startup pane. This is the Getting
Started task pane that appears when you start
Excel, with options like Get the Latest News
About Using Excel. If Microsoft has a more sorry
excuse for a task pane, I’ve never seen it.

Put the Formula Auditing toolbar at the top.
This toolbar, shown in Figure 32-4, has saved my
bacon so many times that I always give it a place
of prominence. See the sidebar, “The Formula
Auditing Toolbar.”
• Figure 34-2: The Excel save-your-tail Formula Auditing
toolbar.
Setting up the Options dialog 
box and AutoCorrect
Here’s how to get the easy changes knocked out. If
you don’t want to read the why, just follow the what
in the figures:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View.
You see the View tab of the Options dialog box
(see Figure 34-3).
2.
Clear the Startup Task Pane check box and
select the Page Breaks check box.
The task pane won’t appear the next time you
start Excel, and Excel will automatically show
you dotted lines at all page breaks, all the time.
• Figure 34-3: My recommended View options.
3.
Click the Edit tab.
Excel shows the Edit tab of the Options dialog
box (see Figure 34-4).

check box, or (if your work habits are different
from mine) change the Direction that Excel
should move after you press the Enter key.

(see Figure 34-5).
• Figure 34-5: My recommended General options.
6.
Run the Recently Used File List up to 9.
I have no idea why Microsoft limits this to 9.
If you have an IntelliMouse (or work-alike) and
want to zoom in and out quickly while looking
at your spreadsheets, also consider selecting
the Zoom on Roll with IntelliMouse check box.
If you leave this setting cleared, rolling the
mouse wheel scrolls through the spreadsheet.
7.
Click the Save tab.
Excel displays the Save tab of the Options dialog
box (see Figure 34-6).
8.
Put the AutoRecover cycle between 3 and 5
minutes.
It’s a question of time: If you commonly work
with large spreadsheets, you probably want the
interval higher, just so you aren’t constantly
competing with AutoSave for control of your
spreadsheet. (Conversely, though, if something
goes bump in the night, you folks with big
spreadsheets have more to lose!)

Making Key Changes
251
I don’t recommend changing AutoCorrect
settings — they’re pretty innocuous — but I do
want to warn you about a particularly lousy bit
of terminology here. The Show AutoCorrect
Options Buttons check box at the top should
read Show AutoCorrect Option Smart Tags (or
something along that line). The check box
controls whether Excel shows a Smart Tag
each time it applies AutoCorrect. I find it
almost impossible to find the Smart Tags in
most cases, but unless you’re congenitally
indisposed to Smart Tags, I suggest you leave
it enabled.
11.
Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
Excel shows you the AutoFormat tab of the
AutoCorrect dialog box, as shown in Figure 34-8.
• Figure 34-8: My recommended AutoFormat As You Type
options.
12.
Clear the Internet and Network Paths with
Hyperlinks check box. Then click OK.
Almost done.
13.
Choose View➪Toolbars and enable the Formula
Auditing toolbar.
Excel brings up the Formula Auditing toolbar
(refer to Figure 34-2). See the sidebar “The
Formula Auditing Toolbar” for the reasons why
the Formula Auditing toolbar comes in handy all
the time. You might want to click and drag it
someplace handy. You can even dock it on the
left or right edge of the screen, if you like.
14.
Choose File➪Exit.
Just to be sure, exit Excel and start it again. All
your changes should take.
The Formula Auditing Toolbar
Excel 2003 includes a remarkable collection of error-catching
and correcting tools. Unfortunately, most Excel users never
see them because many of them sit on a toolbar that isn’t
exactly a household word.
To see how this toolbar works, follow the procedure in this
section to make the Formula Auditing toolbar (refer to
Figure 34-2) visible. Then open a spreadsheet — any
spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, click in a cell that’s calcu-
lated based on the contents of other cells — a simple sum,
say, or a product. Click the second icon (Trace Precedents)
on the Formula Auditing toolbar. Excel draws a box around
all the cells that are used to calculate the value in the cho-
sen cell, showing you very quickly and easily whether the
formula you used includes all the cells you expected it to.
To remove the precedent arrows, click the next icon:
Remove Precedent Arrows.
Similarly, you can click a cell and see arrows point to where
that cell is used in formulas in the spreadsheet. Excel calls
those dependencies.
Formula auditing rates as one of the most powerful, quick,
easy ways to check a spreadsheet for errors — if you know
the toolbar is there!
Increasing the levels of undo
There’s one difficult change to Excel that I highly rec-
ommend. If you never make mistakes, you needn’t
bother. But if you occasionally make a big blooper
and you don’t discover the error until 16 or more
edits down the line, you can save a huge amount of
time by simply undoing whatever you did wrong . . .
that is, providing you remove Excel’s 16-level amnesia.

Click OK and then exit the Registry Editor.

Start Excel.
Excel remembers up to 100 actions for the Undo
function.
Modifying Your Default
Spreadsheet
When Excel creates a new, blank spreadsheet, it
actually creates a copy of the spreadsheet called

Here’s how to increase the number of undo levels in

Modifying Your Default Spreadsheet
253
If you want to make changes to your default spread-
sheet — the one that appears every time you create
a new, blank spreadsheet — the easiest way is to
modify book.xlt directly. Here’s how:
1.
Check whether you already have a book.xlt
file by choosing File➪Open and navigating to
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\
XLSTART. If you find a file called book.xlt,
open it.
Unless you’ve been modifying Excel, you won’t
find a book.xlt. That’s fine. Just start with a
clean new workbook by clicking the New icon at
the far left on the Standard toolbar.
2.
If you want to change the default font, align-
ment, borders, and the like, choose Format➪
Style, make any changes you like, and click OK.
Excel shows you the Style dialog box (see
Figure 34-12).
• Figure 34-12: Change the Normal style to modify default
fonts and so on.
3.
If you want your new workbooks to appear
with just one or two sheets, right-click the
Sheet3 tab at the bottom of the screen and
choose Delete.
You can have as many or as few as you like.
4.
To create a default header or footer (generally
a good idea), choose View➪Header and Footer.
Excel shows you the Page Setup dialog box, as
shown in Figure 34-13.
• Figure 34-13: Default headers and footers for all my new,
blank workbooks.
5.
Select the header or footer that you want. Or,
click Custom Header and/or Custom Footer and
put together precisely the header and/or footer
you wish.
In Figure 34-13, I choose to put the name of the
workbook in the header, and my name, date, and
page number in the footer.
It might look like you’re hard-coding Book1,
for example, into the header, but that isn’t the
case. If you stick with the choices on offer,
Excel is smart enough to swap the name of
the spreadsheet when it comes time to print.
The header in a new workbook won’t appear
as Book1 but will (as you might hope) reflect
the actual name of the spreadsheet.

Technique 34: Getting Excel Settings Right
254
• Figure 34-14: Save book.xlt in the XLSTART folder.
6.
Click OK to return to the spreadsheet.
7.
When you finish your customizing — and you
can customize just about anything — choose
File➪Save. In the Save as Type box, choose
Template. In the Name box, type book. Finally,
navigate to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\OFFICE11\XLSTART folder and then
click Save.
That saves your customized normal template in
the place it needs to be (see Figure 34-14).

Building 
Self-Verifying
Spreadsheets
W
hat? Your spreadsheets are always right the first time? Cool. You
don’t need this Technique at all.
For the other 99.999 percent of us, slapping together anything more than
a trivial spreadsheet is a mind-numbing experience. Heck, I’ve had more
than a few trivial spreadsheets turn out bad, too.
It isn’t a question of being careful and thoughtful. Rather, it’s a question
of banging and clanging away at a spreadsheet until something breaks —
then it’s a question of realizing that something’s broken — and then it’s a
question of figuring out what and where and how to fix it.
This Technique brings some powerful verification tools to bear, quickly
and effectively.
Highlighting Conditionally
Most of the time, spreadsheet formatting is something you do after the
numbers look right and you’re getting bored — or you want to impress
somebody.
But I’m here to show you one type of formatting — conditional formatting —
that can help you quickly catch errors in your spreadsheet and errors in
your data.
As its name implies, conditional formatting kicks in when a certain condi-
tion is met. Although conditional formatting can be used to make a
spreadsheet pretty, it’s also a dynamite method for alerting people to
errors: for example, if your annual sales go over a hundred billion dollars,
or the amount of a payroll check goes negative. You tell Excel what condi-
tions apply and, within some surprisingly stringent limits, how to format
the results. When the conditions are met, your chosen formatting is
applied — for example, a number turns bold blue, or a cell background
erupts in fuchsia.

• Figure 35-2: Make a thousand copies or so. It’s quick and
easy with the drag handle.
4.
Click the A column to select it, and then use the
drag handle (now in the upper-right corner of
cell A1) to drag the =RAND( ) formula to
columns B, C, D and on out to Z or thereabouts.
You should see a whole lotta =RAND( )s (see
Figure 35-3).
• Figure 35-3: Lots and lots of =RAND( ) fields.
5.
Press F9 a few times to make Excel recalculate
the random numbers.
At some point, if you have the original,
unpatched version of Excel 2003, a bunch of
those numbers will turn negative. But looking for
negative number-needles in this haystack will
give you a headache in no time: The only way
you can tell that you’re looking at a negative
number is by squinting hard and looking for a
teensy-tiny minus sign. It’s much easier on the
eyes to apply conditional formatting.
6.
Select the entire spreadsheet.
The following example serves double duty: I show
you how to apply conditional formatting to point out
bad numbers in a spreadsheet. At the same time, I
give you a tool for determining whether your copy of
Excel 2003 suffers from a bad bug in the RAND( ) ran-
dom number generator, which came to light a couple
of months after Excel 2003 shipped.
Here’s how to set up a potentially buggy spread-
sheet, apply conditional formatting, and check for
the RAND( ) bug, all in one fell swoop:
1.
Start with a new, blank workbook.
2.
In cell A1, type =RAND( ).
That’s the formula for a random number (see
Figure 35-1). In theory, =RAND( ) is supposed to
generate a pseudo-random number between zero
and one. In the original version of Excel 2003,
there’s a bug in =RAND( ): When you run it
enough times, the values turn negative. Not
good.
• Figure 35-1: The formula for a random number.
3.
Click the drag handle (the lower-right corner)
of cell A1, hold down the mouse button, and
drag the =RAND( ) formula down to cell 1000
or so.
Don’t worry if you overshoot or undershoot by a
hundred cells or so. What you want is about a
thousand copies of the =RAND( ) function (see
Figure 35-2).

Running Self-Verifying Cross-Totals
257
The fastest way to select the whole spread-
sheet is to click in the rectangle to the left of
the A column and above the 1 row.
7.
Choose Format➪Conditional Formatting.
Excel shows you the Conditional Formatting dia-
log box (see Figure 35-4).
• Figure 35-4: Tell Excel that you want to apply special
formatting if the value in a cell is less than 0.
8.
In the first box, choose Cell Value Is. In the sec-
ond box, choose Less Than. In the third box,
type the number 0 (zero). Then click the
Format button.
Excel brings up the Format Cells dialog box (see
Figure 35-5).
• Figure 35-5: Pick an in-yer-face font.
9.
Choose a font treatment that really stands out —
something you can see from 30,000 feet. When
you have made a literally outstanding selection,
click OK twice to return to the spreadsheet.
The details are up to you, but note that you can’t
change the font itself or its size. Choose a font
style. If you like, add an underline, a color, and
strikethrough formatting. Click the Border tab
and pick a border. Or, click Patterns and pick
both a cell-shading color and a pattern.
10.
Set the Zoom setting on the Standard toolbar to
50% or smaller so that you can see a big chunk
of the spreadsheet. Then keep pressing F9.
If you have a buggy version of Excel 2003, sooner
or later, you see a pattern such as the one in
Figure 35-6.
• Figure 35-6: The specially formatted cells are negative —
a very graphic demonstration of the

Running Self-Verifying 
Cross-Totals
In the preceding section, I show you how to tell
Excel that you want to apply a specific format,
dependent on the value of the cell. In this section,

Technique 35: Building Self-Verifying Spreadsheets
258
works — and works well — on spreadsheets that are
far larger and more complex.
Here’s how to make mortal-proof cross-totals:
1.
Create a simple table, like the one in Figure 35-7.
You need a few columns and a few rows. Figure
35-7 lists production figures for my fruit farms in
four Southeast Asian countries. (And if you’ve
never tasted — much less smelled — a durian,
count yourself lucky.)
• Figure 35-7: Woodys Fruit Company production in four
countries.
2.
Create a cross-total in the first row by clicking
the final cell (F2), clicking the AutoSum icon
( looks like a sigma, Σ) on the Standard toolbar,
and then pressing Enter.
A total appears in the cell.
3.
With the total cell still selected, click the Trace
Precedents icon (the second one) on the
Formula Auditing toolbar.
You can immediately see that the sum covers the
four numbers that it should (see Figure 35-8).
See, I told you this is a very powerful toolbar!
4.
Click the drag handle in the lower-right corner
of the total (cell F2 in my example) and copy
the =SUM( ) formula all the way down to the
end of the last data row.
I take conditional formatting one step further and
show you how to create self-verifying totals in
spreadsheets, complete with warnings if something
goes out of kilter.
If you build giant spreadsheets for a living, day in
and day out, you’ve probably amassed a complete
arsenal of tools to help make sure that your spread-
sheets balance properly and that they don’t get
knocked out of whack by someone absent-mindedly
entering data in the wrong place.
Those of us who build small spreadsheets, primarily
for our own use or for folks in our immediate work-
group, don’t need (or want!) those battleship solu-
tions. Fortunately, though, Excel has a handful of
very powerful tools that we mere mortals can use
every day.
In Technique 34, I talk about the Formula
Auditing toolbar, which is a very powerful and
easy-to-use tool to track how cells are being
used in a spreadsheet. That toolbar should be
your first line of defense in building a spread-
sheet. If you can’t see the Formula Auditing
toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars and mark the
Formula Auditing check box. I discuss how to
use it a little later in this Technique.
The most common kind of misbalanced spreadsheet
that I encounter involves taking totals horizontally
and vertically — cross-totals — and the totals don’t
add up. Argg. Typically, the spreadsheet starts out
okay, but when I add a row or a column, the totals
get thrown off. Sometimes, somebody (and I won’t
mention him by name) types over the top of a total —
and when one of the numbers later changes, the
totals don’t.
Here’s a fast and easy way to verify totals in a spread-
sheet and throw a red flag if they don’t balance. The
example that I use here is quite simple, so you don’t
have to type a lot of numbers. But the approach

Running Self-Verifying Cross-Totals
259
• Figure 35-8: Trace precedents on the first row sum.
5.
Click at the bottom of the first data column,
click the AutoSum icon on the Standard tool-
bar, and then press Enter.
You get a column sum, like the one in cell B6 of
Figure 35-9.
• Figure 35-9: The sum for the first column.
6.
Click the drag handle on cell B6 and copy the
=SUM( ) formula all the way to the last data
row, cell E6 (see Figure 35-10).
7.
Click in the grand total cell (cell F6 in my
example).
In this cell, I want to tell Excel, “If the total of all
the columns and the total of all the rows is equal,
use that total. But if it isn’t equal, something’s
wrong, so scream real loud.” Here’s how to, uh,
scream. Real loud.
• Figure 35-10: Cross-foot totals in both directions are
complete.
8.
I could use the Insert Function icon (the one
that looks like fx next to where you type stuff
for the cells), but this formula is easy enough to
type directly. Type this, with no spaces:
=IF(SUM(F2:F5)=SUM(B6:E6),SUM(F2:F5),
“OUT OF BALANCE”)
That tells Excel that if the sum of the column
totals and the sum of the row totals is equal, use
the row totals. But if it isn’t equal, put in the text
OUT OF BALANCE.
Figure 35-11 shows totals that are okay, and
Figure 35-12 shows what happens when I throw
the totals out of balance by typing 3 in cell E6.
• Figure 35-11: If the totals balance, use the number;
otherwise, use the text.

13.
Click the Format button and set the formatting
that you want for the OUT OF BALANCE warn-
ing: bold italic red font, perhaps. Click OK
twice to get back to the spreadsheet.
14.
Test the conditional formatting by clicking
a total cell — say, E6 again — typing 3, and
pressing Enter.
And the crowds go wild (see Figure 35-13).
• Figure 35-13: Conditional formatting applied to OUT OF
BALANCE.
Practice once or twice, and I guarantee this will
become your timesaving method of choice for ensur-
ing that cross-foot totals balance.
• Figure 35-12: If somebody accidentally types over a total,
the spreadsheet reports that it’s out of
balance.
9.
If you test the spreadsheet by stomping on
a total, click Undo on the Standard toolbar
to bring everything back to its full, upright
position.
10.
Apply conditional formatting to the text OUT
OF BALANCE. Start by clicking the grand total
cell (F6 in my case).
11.
Choose Format➪Conditional Formatting.
Excel shows you the Conditional Formatting dia-
log box (refer to Figure 35-4).
12.
In the first box, choose Cell Value Is; in the sec-
ond box, choose Equal To; and in the third box,
type precisely the text that appears when the
cross-totals are out of balance (OUT OF BAL-
ANCE, in this example).

Freezing Columns
and Rows
H
ow many times have you scrolled down in a spreadsheet and then
had to scroll back to the top to figure out what in the %$#@! you were
looking at? Do you have the same problem with printouts, where the
column headings for page 327 appear on page 1 . . . and page 1 alone?
It’s easy to get Excel to show and print column and row headings pre-
cisely the way you want them. It’s also easy to hide rows and columns so
your eyes don’t get distracted by meaningless detail. A few quick clicks,
and you can be concentrating on what the data means — not wondering
what in the heck you’re looking at. So much time has been lost over
something so simple.
Freezing Column Headings
Any spreadsheet with column headings that has enough rows to extend
below the bottom of the screen is a good candidate to have its headings
frozen. To freeze column headings so that they stay in place onscreen, do
the following
1.
Click the row underneath the column heading(s) that you want to
freeze.
In Figure 36-1, I want to freeze the first row, so I click the second row.

Technique 36: Freezing Columns and Rows
262
to be in two places at once — er, if you want to look
at two or four parts of a spreadsheet simultaneously.
Although splitting the screen is inherently a lit-
tle different from freezing headings (see the
preceding section), Excel doesn’t allow you to
freeze headings and split the screen at the
same time.
To split the screen, first choose how many panes
you want and how they will appear:

To split the screen horizontally into two panes
(one on top of the other): Select the row that
you want to become the top row of the lower
pane.

To split the screen vertically into two panes
(side by side): Select the column that you want
to become the leftmost column of the right pane.

To split the screen into four panes (like a 2 x 2
paned window): Click a cell, which becomes the
upper-left cell of the lower-right pane.
Then choose Window➪Split, and Excel splits the
window into two or four panes, depending on your
choice. Figure 36-3 shows a split into two horizontal
panes, top and bottom. Each pane can be scrolled
independently.
• Figure 36-3: Split panes work differently from frozen
headings because each pane can be scrolled
anywhere in the spreadsheet.
To get rid of the split, choose Window➪
Remove Split.
2.
Choose Window➪Freeze Panes.
From that point on, the headings stay put while
you scroll the data up and down (see Figure 36-2).
• Figure 36-2: The data scrolls while the headings stay
frozen onscreen.
Freezing the screen doesn’t affect what’s
printed.
To freeze row headings (that is, to make specific
columns appear onscreen while the rest of the data
scrolls), click the column to the right of the headings
that you want to freeze and then choose Window➪
Freeze Panes.
To freeze both column headings and row headings,
click the cell immediately to the right and below the
headings you want to freeze (which is to say, click
the upper-left cell that you want to be able to move)
and then choose Window➪Freeze Panes.
You can’t freeze arbitrary rows or columns:
Excel only allows you to freeze the row(s) on
top and/or the column(s) on the left.
To unfreeze all the frozen columns and rows in a
spreadsheet, choose Window➪Unfreeze Panes.
Splitting the Screen
You can split the Excel screen into two or four panes,
and each pane can be scrolled to any part of the
spreadsheet. That can come in very handy if you need

263
Printing Repeating
Column Headings
Frequently, you want to repeat column headings at
the top of every page in a printout — for precisely
the same reason why you might want to freeze col-
umn headings onscreen. It’s easy:
1.
Choose File➪Page Setup➪Sheet.
Excel shows you the Sheet tab of the Page Setup
dialog box, as shown in Figure 36-4.
• Figure 36-4: Set repeating column headings here.
2.
Click once inside the Rows to Repeat at Top
box.
Your cursor turns into a right-pointing arrow.
Note: The Row and Column Headings check box
in the middle of the Page Setup dialog box is very
confusing. If you enable this setting, Excel prints
the A/B/C column identifiers and the 1/2/3 row
identifiers along with the data in the spread-
sheet. You don’t get row or column headings that
you’ve entered.
3.
Back in your spreadsheet, click once anywhere
in the row that you wish to repeat on every page.
If you want to repeat more than one column
heading, click and drag the right-pointing arrow
cursor over all the rows with column headings
that you want to print.
You can have row headings repeated on every
page, too, by using a similar approach. In Step 2,
click in the Columns to Repeat at Left box (refer
to Figure 36-4) and make your selection. The
same click-and-drag method mentioned in Step 3
works here, too.
4.
Click Print Preview.
You should look at the printout at least once
before wasting paper.
5.
When the print preview appears (see Figure
36-5), click Next in the upper-left corner.
That puts you on to page 2 — the first place
where you can see whether your repeated col-
umn headings are working.
• Figure 36-5: Make sure you preview the printout at least
once.
6.
If it looks good, click Print.
If it doesn’t look good, click Close and try again.
If your page doesn’t look right, you need to go
back to the Page Setup dialog box; clicking
the Setup button in Print Preview won’t get
you to the settings you need.

To unhide a row or column
1.
Select the rows or columns surrounding the
hidden row or column.
In Figure 36-7, I select both columns B and D.
• Figure 36-7: To unhide, select the columns before and
after the hidden column.
2.

Bending an Elbow at A1
Excel titles can look so hokey. Frequently, all I want
to do is put a short label in the upper-left corner of a
spreadsheet that identifies both the columns and the
rows. It’s called an elbow, and you can make one
very quickly:
1.
In the cell, type the column heading label,
press Alt+Enter, and then type the label for the
row headings. Adjust the height and width of
Hiding Rows and Columns
Inevitably, any large spreadsheet grows rows and
columns that you really don’t want to look at:
interim calculations, extraneous details, and sort
fields can all slow you down when you really want to
look at the meat of the report.
When you hide a row or a column, it doesn’t
appear on printouts or onscreen. You must
unhide the row or column before it will appear
on the printed page.
Hiding is not a security measure. Anybody
vaguely familiar with Excel will notice that a
column is missing — for example, when a
spreadsheet jumps from column B to column
D, it’s a dead giveaway. In addition, there’s a
visual cue — a slightly widened line between
columns when the column in between has
been hidden.
It’s easy to hide a row or column:
1.
Select the row or column.
2.
Right-click it and choose Hide.
In Figure 36-6, I hide column C. Note that the cal-
culations remain the same — Excel still acknowl-
edges that there’s data in the hidden cell and
uses it appropriately.
• Figure 36-6: Column C has been hidden. Notice the
slightly thickened line between columns B
and D.

the column label appears on top and the row

In Figure 36-9, I pressed Alt+Enter and then typed

until the labels looked about right, adding a few
spaces to balance it all out.

On the Drawing toolbar, click the Line tool (to
the right of AutoShapes) and draw a diagonal
line in cell A1.
After a little more dragging and cajoling, and

xcel makes a great flat-file database program.
No, I’m not supposed to say that. The Party Line dictates that Access takes
the accolades for databases, which is great if you need third-normalized-
form linked databases with robust query capabilities, sophisticated data
integrity features, and reporting sliced and diced through an electronic
Veg-o-Matic. But if you just need to keep track of the inventory in your
small business, monthly budgets, kids in your Scout troop, or CDs in
your collection, a flat-file database works well enough.
In Excel-speak, a flat-file database is called a list. Excel lists can hold enor-
mous volumes of information, which you can manipulate in a New Yawk
minute. If you have a list, subtotaling and totaling is easy and near invisi-
ble (see Technique 38). They form the foundation for well-behaved pivot
charts (see Technique 41).
If you have a lot of data, use a list.
Making a List, Checking It Twice
A list is just a bunch of data in an Excel spreadsheet. Each column (analo-
gous to a field in the database world) contains a specific kind of data — a
salesperson’s name, the date, or the amount sold, for example. Each row
(analogous to a record in the database world) contains a single entry in
the database. Er, list. The only real restriction in Excel is that you should
never have a completely blank row or column. (When Excel hits a blank
row or column, it thinks that you might be trying to start a new list.)
In earlier versions of Excel, you had to set up a list manually, putting a
row of headings — field names, if you will — at the top. Starting with
Excel 2003, Excel can do it all for you.
37
Technique

Making a List, Checking It Twice
267
1.
Start with a new spreadsheet.
2.
Type the column headings — the field names —
for your list in the first row.
I start a list for Woodys Fruit Company Sales Log
by typing headings in A1, B1, and so on until F1.
Each column heading must be unique —
you can’t use the same text for two different
headings.
3.
Choose Data➪List➪Create List.
Excel responds with the Create List dialog box,
also shown in Figure 37-1.
• Figure 37-1: Define where the list is.
4.
Excel probably chose the row of headings for
you. If it didn’t, click and drag across all the
headings.
The Where Is the Data for Your List? box should
show the cells that you select.
5.
Mark the My List Has Headers check box. Then
click OK.
Excel responds by creating the list, as shown in
Figure 37-2.
The list in Figure 37-2 is remarkable for two
reasons. One, the headings are set up with
AutoFilter drop-down arrows (see the final
section in this Technique). Two, Excel reserves
one row at the bottom of the list — the insert
row, with an asterisk placeholder — for new
data. Both are great timesavers. The AutoFilter
lets you select and sort quickly; the insert row
lets you put more data in the list, adjusting the
range automatically.
• Figure 37-2: The list appears in a flash.
6.
To apply formatting to any columns that need
it, select the column and then choose Format➪
Cells.
In this example, I format the Date field to appear
as Month-Year (Mar-01), the Quantity field as a
number with one decimal place, and the Amount
field as currency with two decimal places and a
dollar sign.
7.
Click row 2 (just click the numeral 2) to select
the entire second row.
8.
Choose Window➪Freeze Panes.
The column headings are frozen onscreen. (See
Technique 36 for more on freezing headings.)
That’s all it takes to create a heavy-duty list.
You can start entering data directly in the list, or you
can follow the steps in the next section to have Excel
build a custom data entry form for you.

Technique 37: Ripping through Lists
268
4.
Press the down-arrow key, press Enter, or click
the New button of the data entry form.
Excel enters the record into the list, as you might
expect, but it also expands the list by one row,
moving the asterisk-marked insert row down by
one (see Figure 37-4).
• Figure 37-4: Data goes in very quickly when you use
Excel’s form.
If you press the up- and down-arrow keys, you
quickly discover that the data entry form moves
from record to record — which is to say, row
to row — in the list. You can use the data entry
form to make changes or delete records.
If you delete a record, be very aware of the
fact that you can’t undo the delete: When you
use the form, deleted rows are well and truly
gone.
Filling In Data with
AutoComplete
If you have text entries that repeat in several
columns — say, a name that appears over and
over again, or a city — you’ll find it faster to
type data directly into the list via Excel’s
AutoComplete capability.
If you enter data manually, you can resize the
list by clicking any cell in the list, choosing
Data➪List➪Resize List, and then dragging the
pulsating outline to extend the size of the old
list.
Entering Data Manually
with a Form
Excel’s custom-built data entry form can be an enor-
mous help if you need to enter different data in each
row or if most of the data that you enter isn’t text.
By far the simplest, fastest, and least error-prone
way to enter data in an Excel list is by using a data
entry form created by Excel itself. Here’s how:
1.
Use the procedure in the preceding section to
create a list. Click once anywhere inside the
list.
2.
Choose Data➪Form.
Excel constructs a data entry form on-the-fly,
using the list’s column headings for field names.
3.
Type the data for a record on the form.
In Figure 37-3, I type a record for Justin selling
durian from the farm in Thailand in January, 2004.
• Figure 37-3: Entering the first record (row) for the list.

AutoFiltering to Find Stuff Fast
269
Here’s how to use AutoComplete to add a new record:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Edit. Select the Move
Selection After Enter check box. Choose the
direction Right and then click OK.
If you’re entering data in a list, you probably
want Excel to move to the next cell to the right
every time you press Enter. Excel is smart enough
to realize when it reaches the last column in a
row, automatically jumping to the first cell in the
next row.
2.
Click the cell with the asterisk.
That’s the first cell in the row that Excel automat-
ically maintains to add new items to your list.
3.
Type the data for the first cell and then press
Enter.
Excel goes to the next field in the record, er, col-
umn in the row.
4.
Start typing.
If you’re typing in a column that contains text and
the text that you’re typing matches another entry
in the column, Excel suggests an AutoComplete
for you (see Figure 37-5). The AutoComplete
appears in white on a black background.
• Figure 37-5: AutoComplete suggestions appear if you
begin to type text that matches some other
entry in the list.
5.
If you want to accept the AutoComplete sugges-
tion, press Enter or any directional arrow.
Excel moves on to the next cell.
If you want to choose from among the
AutoComplete entries without typing any-
thing, press Alt+↓. Use the up- and down-
arrow keys to choose from the list and then
press Enter when you find the one you want.
Unfortunately, AutoComplete doesn’t work in
data entry forms. It also doesn’t work for num-
bers or dates. But when it works, it’s a time-
saver of the first degree.
AutoFiltering to Find Stuff Fast
When you create a list from the method in the first
section in this Technique, Excel 2003 also creates
AutoFilters on all the columns. That’s what those
down arrows on the right side of the headings are for.
In earlier versions of Excel, or if you didn’t
follow the directions here, you can create
AutoFilters on all the columns by clicking
inside the list and then choosing Data➪
Filter➪AutoFilter.
AutoFilters let you restrict the visible portion of the
list:
1.
Click the down arrow next to the field (column)
that you want to limit.
You see a list of available AutoFilters. In Figure
37-6, I click the down arrow next to Salesperson.

Technique 37: Ripping through Lists
270
• Figure 37-7: I filtered this list to show only Justin’s sales.
4.
To remove AutoFiltering on a particular col-
umn, click the down arrow and choose (All).
• Figure 37-8: Even Excel has to have a Top Ten.
• Figure 37-6: AutoFilters allow you to restrict the visible
list to the items listed in Table 37-1.
2.
Choose one of the AutoFilter options described
in Table 37-1.
Excel restricts the list to the option you choose.
In Figure 37-7, I show only those sales made by
Justin.
Note the row numbers on the left, which corre-
spond to the full list’s row (record) numbers.
3.
You can further restrict the list by clicking the
down arrow on a different heading and choos-
ing another AutoFilter criterion.

Running Subtotals
A
nybody with a long list of data will, at some point, wonder about
subtotals and totals. How many widgets did each of your top sales-
people peddle? Which store had the most charitable donations?
If you try to use Excel’s native SUM( ) and SUBTOTAL( ) functions, you’ll
get the right result. Eventually. If you try hard enough.
But if you set up your data properly — in a list, as I describe in Technique
37 — and use the tools that Excel provides, running totals and subtotals
(and Averages and Max’s and Min’s) by this or by that, including these
things or excluding those things, takes just a few clicks.
Very powerful. Almost always accurate. And fast, fast, fast.
AutoFiltering Totals
If you just want a total, click the AutoSum button (look for the sigma, Σ)
on the Standard toolbar, drag the flashing selection to cover the numbers
you want, press Enter, and you’re done.
But what if you want to look at totals for different groups of data — say,
total sales for a particular salesperson, or total sales for a specific product,
or total sales for a specific product by a particular salesperson? I know a
fast, easy way that doesn’t involve pivot tables or any particularly obtuse
magic.
The trick lies in turning your data into a bona fide, Excel-recognized list.
After that, cranking out a total is easy.
Setting up data for AutoFiltering
To make a list, you have two choices:

Build a list from the ground up. If you have Excel 2003, follow the
steps in Technique 37.

Convert your existing data into a list. This is the only option in Excel
2002 and earlier.
Technique

Technique 38: Running Subtotals
272
• Figure 38-2: Add column headings to every column.
4.
Choose Data➪List➪Create List.
Excel shows you the Create List dialog box (see
Figure 38-3).
• Figure 38-3: Convert the data to a bona fide list.
5.
If Excel didn’t select the correct region for the
list, click and drag the outline to cover the list
that you want. Select the My List Has Headers
check box and then click OK.
Excel creates a real list, with AutoFilter drop-
down arrows for each column (see Figure 38-4).
Here is the fastest and cleanest way to convert exist-
ing data into a list:
1.
Use File➪Save As to save the current spread-
sheet with a new name (so you don’t clobber
the current spreadsheet). If you prefer, you can
copy the data into a new spreadsheet.
In Figure 38-1, I copy a bunch of sales data for
Woodys Fruit Company into a new spreadsheet.
• Figure 38-1: Start by selecting raw data to convert into
a list.
2.
Delete any empty rows. Delete any empty
columns. If possible, type the correct data in
any empty cells.
To delete a row, select the whole row and then
choose Edit➪Delete. I need to delete the two
empty rows (rows 4 and 10) in Figure 38-1.
3.
Put headings at the top of every column (see
Figure 38-2).
If you need to insert a new row at the top for the
headings, select the top row and then choose
Insert➪Rows.
Each column heading must be different. For
example, you can’t have two columns called
Name.

AutoFiltering Totals
273
• Figure 38-4: An Excel-recognized list.
6.
Select the second row (click the numeral 2 on
the far-left column) and then choose Window➪
Freeze Panes.
That freezes the column headings so that they’re
always visible, even if you scroll way down in the
list.
Generating the totals
After your data is in a bona fide list — with those
drop-down arrows next to each column heading —
running totals (Averages, Max’s, Min’s, and so on)
couldn’t be simpler. Now you can also easily autofil-
ter a list and see totals of any combination of criteria
that you choose:
1.
Click inside the list.
2.
Choose Data➪List➪Total Row.
Excel adds a row at the bottom of the list, enti-
tled Total, that includes a decent guess at exactly
what you wanted to total (see Figure 38-5).
3.
If you want any other columns totaled, click the
appropriate cell in the Total row, click the
down arrow that appears to the right, and then
select the function that you like.
In Figure 38-6, I put the sum of the Quantity col-
umn on the Total row, too.
• Figure 38-5: If your data is in a list, running a total is easy.
• Figure 38-6: Add more columns to the Total row, if you
like.

Technique 38: Running Subtotals
274
1.
Figure out which column(s) you want to subto-
tal. Sort the column by clicking once in the col-
umn and then clicking the Sort Ascending icon
(looks like an A stacked on a Z, with a down
arrow on the right) on the Standard toolbar.
In Figure 38-8, I sort by Fruit.
• Figure 38-8: Sort on the column that you want to
subtotal.
You can create subtotals within subtotals. To
do so, you need to sort by the major column
and then by the minor column. In this exam-
ple, to produce subtotals by Farm within
Salesperson, you need to first sort by
Salesperson; then, within each Salesperson,
sort by Farm. Although Excel has lots of fancy
ways to sort by anything under the sun, the
fastest way to sort for Salesperson/Farm subto-
tals is to use the Sort Ascending icon to first
sort by Farm and then by Salesperson.
2.
Choose Data➪Subtotals.
Excel shows you the Subtotal dialog box in
Figure 38-9.
4.
To see a subset of the data, use the AutoFilter
arrows to the right of each column’s heading
(see Technique 37).
In Figure 38-7, I select Justin from the Salesperson
drop-down AutoFilter list. Note how the sum
changes from 1,832.1 to 91.1 to reflect only the
sum of the quantity of fruit that Justin sold.
• Figure 38-7: Totals for Justin only.
Showing Subtotals
Although the simplest, fastest method of displaying
totals and filtered totals revolves around bona fide
Excel lists, the quickest way I know to see subtotals
and totals requires you to get rid of the “official” list
and turn it into a plain, old everyday Excel range.
Subtotals are a pain in the neck with bona fide lists.
They’re easy as can be with a plane range.
If your data is in an official list, you can see
drop-down arrows next to the heading on
each column. To convert it to a range, just click
once inside the list and then choose Data➪
Lists➪Convert to Range. It’s that simple. Excel
changes the formatting when you go back and
forth, but the data remains the same.
When the data you want to subtotal is in a range,
here’s how to get the subtotals you want:

Showing Subtotals
275
• Figure 38-9: Set subtotals here.
3.
Choose the breakpoint where you want subto-
tals to appear in the At Each Change In drop-
down list.
In this case, I want a subtotal to show up every
time the Fruit field changes.
4.
Pick the function from the Use Function drop-
down list.
You can choose from Sum (which is the subto-
tal), Count, Average, Max, Min, Standard
Deviation, and more. I want the sum.
5.
Pick the columns that you wish to subtotal by
marking the check boxes in Add Subtotal To.
I want subtotals on the Quantity and the Amount.
If you mark the Summary Below Data box, Excel
puts the subtotal at the end, which is where you
usually see subtotals. Leave the check box
cleared to get the subtotals at the top.
6.
Click OK.
Excel shows you both subtotals for each kind
of Fruit and a Grand Total at the bottom (see
Figure 38-10).
• Figure 38-10: Subtotals and grand totals are that fast and
easy.
To hide or expand groups of data, click the +
and – signs on the far left (refer to Figure 38-10).
To remove all the subtotals in a list, choose
Data➪Subtotals; in the Subtotal dialog box
(see Figure 38-9), click Remove All.
Pivot tables (see Technique 40) give you much more
flexibility, but they’re also much more difficult to set
up and substantially harder (and slower) to use, par-
ticularly if you’re not accustomed to how they work.
For many situations, lists, and subtotals give you the
most timesaving bang for the buck.

Creating Custom
AutoFill Series
N
o doubt (okay, almost little doubt) you’ve used Excel’s AutoFill fea-
ture to fill cells with a range of numbers or dates, or maybe the
names of days of the week or months. If your list was anything
more complex than a sequence of numbers, no doubt you’ve also had
quite a time explaining to Excel exactly what you wanted to do.
Excel makes it very, very easy to convert any sequence into a custom
AutoFill series if you’ve already typed the sequence in a spreadsheet. If
you’re a teacher, you can make an AutoFill series type the names of all
your students — one simple click-and-drag does all the work. If you’re
forever typing all your branch office names, a custom AutoFill series
means that you type it once, click, and drag . . . and it’s done. Need a list
of house addresses? Names of the U.S. Senators? All the teams in the
NFL? Numbers from one to a hundred in pig Latin? Got it, done it, angbay,
angbay, angbay.
This Technique shows you how.
Using Fill Lists
Before you consider building your own custom AutoFill series, take a
moment to see whether Excel already has one for you:
1.
Start with a clean spreadsheet.
2.
In cell A1, type Mon.
Mon, of course, stands for Monday (see Figure 39-1). Other valid text
entries are listed in Table 39-1.
3.
Hover your mouse over the lower-right corner of the cell and jiggle
it around until it turns into a big bold + sign.

of things that you can do without typing much
at all. If you think that Excel might be able to
autofill something, give it a try! It’s fast.
Making Your Own
AutoFill Series
If you ever type the same series of values more than
once, take a second and turn that series into a custom
AutoFill series. You’ll never have to type it again!
Before you create a custom AutoFill series, you
should pause for a minute and think about how
you’ll use it. There’s a trick with custom series, and
it can make a big difference as to how quickly you
can use the series.
Here’s the dilemma: Excel identifies a series by the
first item in the series. The only way you have to tell
Excel which series to use is by typing out the first
item in its entirety. For example:

If you have a series of NFL football teams that
starts with Broncos, all you have to do is type
Broncos, click the AutoFill handle, drag, and the
list appears in your spreadsheet. Ingobay.

But if you have a nasty, long series — something
like company departments that starts out Human
Resources and Personal Achievement Recognition
Department of Redundancy Department, you have
to type all that text before Excel can find the
AutoFill series that you want. Ukyay.
Before you create your series, you need to decide
whether you can arrange the list so that a short,
unique name appears at the top of the series. I stress
unique because no two custom AutoFill series can
start with the same name.
If you can’t put a short name at the top of the
series, consider sticking a list handle there — a
short, easy-to-remember, easy-to-type word
that will make your custom listing, uh, experi-
ence a bit less tedious.
The problem with using a list handle is that
the list handle itself gets inserted into the
spreadsheet, so you either have to delete it,
move the series over the top of the list handle,
or figure out some way to ignore it.
After you decide whether you need a list handle,
here’s the fast way to convert an already typed
bunch of text into a custom AutoFill series:
1.
If you have a list handle, put it at the top of the
list.
In Figure 39-6, I have a list of student’s names. At
the top, I type Students in the first cell. By put-
ting a list handle in the first cell, it’s easy to
remember and use the custom AutoFill series.
(It will also be easier than remembering to type
Mary M, and I can continue to use Students even
if Mary M leaves my class.)

a name for the series on top.

sure that it works.
Amazing, eh?

series.

Grabbing the Best
with Pivot Tables
I
n Techniques 37 and 38, I show you fast, easy ways to create lists
(read: flat-file databases) in Excel as well as how to sort, filter, total,
and subtotal the lists. Although the methods in those Techniques can
be mastered by anyone who isn’t terrified of numbers, they aren’t very
flexible. For example, refiguring subtotals for a list takes several steps,
and each time that you slice data a different way, you have go back to
square one.
To get the most flexibility, you have to invest some time and gray matter
in learning how to use pivot tables. They take a while to set up, but after
a pivot table is in place, reslicing and dicing the data takes just a click
and a drag. Admittedly, it’s easy to drag the wrong field to the wrong
place, especially when you’re just starting, but it’s easy to drag the way-
ward field back.
In this Technique, I take you through the process of creating a pivot table
and show you a few ways to use one that might surprise you. The learn-
ing curve isn’t all that bad — think of it as a speed bump — but the
results can save you hours — even days — of work.
Creating a Pivot Table
Pivot tables work with lists. A list is just a flat-file database: Each column
represents a field in the database (such as a name, a part number, or a
sales amount); each row represents one record, or entry, in the database
(say, one record for each sale, each inventory count, or each charitable
donation).
You can start with a bona fide Excel-recognized list — one with drop-down
AutoFilter arrows next to each column’s heading — or you can simply cre-
ate a list with a heading row at the top and no blank rows in the middle.

That way, if something goes wrong, you just

Excel creates a new pivot table on a new sheet. It
also brings up the PivotTable toolbar and a list of
all available fields (see Figure 40-4).

Manipulating a Pivot Table
283
• Figure 40-4: A pivot table ready for populating.
6.
To see how a pivot table works, think of how
you might want to view the data in the list.
In this example, I want to look at the amount of
sales for each salesperson, broken out by fruit.
To do that, I drag Salesperson from the
PivotTable Field List and drop it on the block
marked Drop Row Fields Here. Then I drag Fruit
to Drop Column Fields Here. Finally, I drag
Amount into the middle, Drop Data Items Here.
The result is a rather standard-looking spread-
sheet showing sales by salesperson by fruit, as
shown in Figure 40-5.
• Figure 40-5: Drag and drop three fields to create a
simple spreadsheet.
In the next section, I go into detail about slicing and
dicing the data.
Manipulating a Pivot Table
After you have a simple pivot table set up as I
describe in the preceding section, it’s incredibly
easy to look at your data in myriad ways.
For example

You want to see how much of the sales in Figure
40-5 occurred for each farm. Drag the Farm field
from the field list immediately to the right of the
Salesperson field on the pivot table. The result is
in Figure 40-6.

You want to look at just Add and Woody’s sales.
Click the drop-down arrow next to Salesperson
and select the boxes marked Add and Woody. 
• Figure 40-6: Drag the Farm field, and sales are broken
out by farm.

Technique 40: Grabbing the Best with Pivot Tables
284
• Figure 40-8: Sales for February, 2004 only.
4.
To show sales for Feb-04 by salesperson and
farm, click and drag away the cell that reads
Fruit from the spreadsheet. You can drop it
anywhere as long as it’s off the spreadsheet.
Now there’s a simple spreadsheet showing sales
for February, 2004 (see Figure 40-9).
• Figure 40-9: Sales by salesperson by farm, for
February 2004.
The Page box at the top of the spreadsheet is a spe-
cial location: Drop a field in that box, and Excel cre-
ates a separate page for each value of the field.
Here’s how:
1.
Start with the pivot table in Figure 40-5.
It shows sales by salesperson and farm, for each
fruit.
2.
Click the Date field in the Field List box and
drag it to the location that reads Drop Page
Fields Here.
Excel shows all the dates initially, so the sales fig-
ures don’t change (see Figure 40-7).

I hope this little demo gives you a feel for the kinds
of data mining that a pivot table can provide —
quickly.
There’s much, much more. See the next section.
Making a Pivot Table Boogie
In this section, I want to give you a feel for the
incredible power of pivot tables by showing you
some pivot table functions that aren’t obvious, even
after you’ve played with them for a while.
It’s easy to have a pivot table give you a count of
how many times a particular data item appears. For
example, here’s how to tally how many sales each
salesperson made in the sample list from this
Technique:
1.
Clear the pivot table created in the first section
of this Technique by clicking and dragging all
the fields from the four drop areas: Drop Page
Fields Here, Drop Column Fields Here, Drop
Row Fields Here, and Drop Data Items Here.
You can drop them anywhere as long as it’s off
the table.
The cleared table looks similar to a new, blank
table (refer to Figure 40-4).
2.
Click and drag Salesperson from the field list,
dropping it on the Drop Row Fields Here box.
3.
Click and drag Salesperson from the field list
again, but this time, drop it on the Drop Data
Items Here box.
When you drop a text field like Salesperson in
the Data Items box, Excel gives you a count of
how many times a specific entry (for example, a
specific salesperson) appears. See Figure 40-10.
4.
If you want to know the number of sales for
each salesperson by farm, click and drag the
Farm field to the Drop Column Fields Here box.
You get the report in Figure 40-11.
• Figure 40-10: How many sales did each salesperson
make?
• Figure 40-11: How many sales did each salesperson
make by farm?
Pivot tables aren’t limited to totals or counts in the
Drop Data Items Here box. In fact, there’s an entire
world of options for showing precisely the kind of
information you want to find.
For example, say you’re interested in learning more
about the largest sale made by each salesperson.
Here are a few different ways of looking at it.

Technique 40: Grabbing the Best with Pivot Tables
286
• Figure 40-13: Tell the pivot table to show you the
maximum sales amount.
• Figure 40-14: The maximum sale for each salesperson.
1.
Clear the pivot table created in the first section
of this Technique by clicking and dragging all
the fields from the four drop areas.
Your pivot table should look like Figure 40-4.
2.
Click and drag the Salesperson field, dropping
it on the Drop Row Fields Here box. Drag the
Amount field to the Drop Data Items Here box.
Your sheet should look like Figure 40-12.
• Figure 40-12: Sales by salesperson. Ho-hum.
3.
Double-click the box that reads Sum of Amount.
You see the PivotTable Field dialog box, as
shown in Figure 40-13.
4.
Choose Max (in the Summarize By list) and
then click OK.
The pivot table now shows you the maximum
sale for each salesperson (see Figure 40-14).

Making a Pivot Table Boogie
287
The line marked Grand Total in Figure 40-14 is
a misnomer. It isn’t the grand total. Rather, it’s
the maximum of all maximum sales. Because
Add’s highest sale is 4120.95 and Add had the
single highest sale of all the salespeople, the
Max of the Max is 4120.95, which is the num-
ber erroneously reported as the Grand Total.
5.
Say you want to know which farm accounted
for the largest sale for each salesperson. Start
by clicking and dragging the Farm field from
the field list, and dropping it immediately to
the right of the Salesperson box.
The pivot table now shows you the maximum
sale for each salesperson for each farm (see
Figure 40-15).
Once again, Grand Total is a misnomer. It’s the
Max of the Max.
• Figure 40-15: Maximum sales for each salesperson for
each farm.
6.
Double-click the Farm cell.
Excel brings up the PivotTable Field dialog box,
as shown in Figure 40-16.
• Figure 40-16: Modify how the pivot table looks at the
field.
7.
Click the Advanced button.
Excel shows you the PivotTable Field Advanced
Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 40-17.
• Figure 40-17: Limit the number of different values shown
for the field.
8.
Under the Top 10 AutoShow heading, select the
On radio button, set Show to Top, and set the
counter at 1. Click OK twice.
The pivot table report now looks like Figure 40-18.

Technique 40: Grabbing the Best with Pivot Tables
288
Figure 40-18 shows you both the maximum sale for
each salesperson and also (in admittedly a rather
obtuse way) which farm was associated with the
sale: Add’s biggest sale was for the Malaysia farm,
Woody’s was for the Indonesia farm, and both Justin
and Guy had their best sales for the Thailand farm.
Pivot tables are incredibly powerful. It takes a bit of
effort to get them set up, and the reports can be a
bit hard to interpret. But you can save enormous
amounts of time sifting through piles of data by sim-
ply dragging and dropping.
• Figure 40-18: Where the maximum sale took place.

Creating Pivot
Charts That
Work Right
H
ow many times have you put together some interesting data, cre-
ated a chart, run it up the corporate flagpole — or shown it around
your Tuesday Lunchtime Investment Club, for that matter — and
discovered that somehow, you didn’t plot the most important data?
Happens all the time. What’s boring to you might be utterly insightful to
me. Or (sorry to say) vice versa.
Excel pivot charts let you dash back to your computer, lick your wounds,
regraph your data in a new and exciting way, print it, and run it back to
the group. The slowest part of the whole process is the lousy color
printer, which can’t keep up with your breakneck pace.
I don’t talk about regular Excel charts very much. There’s a reason
why. If you want to save time, don’t bother with regular charts. Any
time you think about creating a chart in Excel, you really should think
about doing a pivot chart instead. Pivot charts do have a slightly
higher learning curve — a speed bump with a pimple, if you will —
and they aren’t quite as pretty as regular Excel charts. But the very
first time you have to redo a chart for any tiny reason, you’ll thank
your lucky stars if you originally built it as a pivot chart.
Starting with a Good List
Every pivot chart starts out as a pivot table.
You don’t have to work with the pivot table — the Pivot Table and
PivotChart Wizard can let you skip over working with the pivot table
directly — but the pivot table exists, nonetheless.
That’s why it’s important for you to get your data in order — making sure
it’s in the form of a list, which is Excel’s version of a flat-file database —
before you try to draw a pivot chart.

• Figure 41-1: The wizard should be able to find your list.
After you click Next in Step 2 of the wizard, the
wizard segues to its last step.
5.
Select the New Worksheet radio button and
then click Finish.
You don’t want to put the pivot table on the same
sheet as the main data. Selecting New Worksheet
helps you avoid stomping all over yourself. 
After you click Finish, Excel creates a new pivot
table on a new sheet (called Sheet1, unless you
already have a Sheet1). Excel also creates a new
pivot chart on another new sheet (called Chart1;
see Figure 41-2). It also shows the Chart toolbar
and the PivotTable toolbar as well as a list of all
available fields.
6.
Pivot charts work a lot like pivot tables. If you
follow the example in Technique 40, try some-
thing similar by clicking and dragging an item
from the field list to the box marked Drop
Category Fields Here. Drag and drop another
field onto Drop Data Items Here. Finally, drag
and drop a third field onto Drop Series Fields
Here.
It’s really that easy to create a pivot chart. In
Figure 41-3, I created a chart that shows how
many dollars worth of fruit each salesperson
sold.

If you’re feeling lucky, you can build the list man-
ually. Remember that the top cell in each column
should contain a label for the column, and that
every entry in the column should follow suit. For
example, if you have a column of telephone num-
bers, you don’t want one cell in that column to
contain a date. Also remember that you should
have no blank rows.

If you use Excel 2003 and need to create a list,
refer to Technique 37 for fast, easy, and foolproof
instructions on building a list from scratch.

If you don’t use Excel 2003, you can still employ
many of Excel’s built-in tools to help you create a
list. See Technique 38 for details.
After you have a list in place, I strongly recommend
that you run through Technique 40 to get a feel for
how pivot tables work. To a first approximation, the
same drag-and-drop methods that work with pivot
tables also work with pivot charts.
Building a Pivot Chart
If you have a good list, here is how to build a pivot
chart:
1.
Click inside a well-formed list.
2.
Choose Data➪PivotTable and PivotChart
Report.
The Pivot Table and PivotChart Wizard appears.
3.
Choose both the Microsoft Office Excel List or
Database and the PivotChart Report ( With
PivotTable Report) radio buttons and then click
Next.
If the wizard was able to find your list, Step 2 of
the wizard highlights the column headings and
the list (see Figure 41-1).
4.
If the wizard recognizes your entire list, click
Next. If not, you might have a bad (which is to
say, blank) row. Click Cancel, find the problem
and correct it, and then go back to Step 1.

Re-Creating a Pivot Chart
291
• Figure 41-2: A pivot table ready for populating.
• Figure 41-3: Drag and drop three fields, and you have a
serviceable (albeit a bit, uh, homely) pivot chart.
Pivot charts can be modified quickly by clicking and
dragging — just like their pivot table brethren.
Re-Creating a Pivot Chart
If you have a pivot chart such as the one I create in
the preceding section, modifying the chart couldn’t
be simpler. For example:

If you want to see sales by farm instead of sales by
fruit, click the Fruit box from the Series fields loca-
tion (in Excel-speak, it’s the top line of the
Legend) and drag it off the chart: make sure you
grab the entire drop-down list at the top of the leg-
end, and drop it just about anywhere. Then click
Farm in the fields list and drop it on the box that
reads Drop Series Fields Here (see Figure 41-4).
• Figure 41-4: Change the pivot chart to sales by salesperson
by farm — elapsed time, about five seconds.

If you want to see how much of each fruit was
sold at each farm, click and drag Salesperson
from the chart (drop it anywhere you like); then
click Fruit from the fields list and drag it to
where it reads Drop Category Fields Here (see
Figure 41-5).
• Figure 41-5: Fruit by farm, another five seconds.

information and click Finish. Your pivot table and
pivot chart will be updated.

If you change the underlying data in the list,
your pivot chart won’t update automatically. To
update the data, right-click inside any of the
fields in the pivot chart and choose Refresh Data.
Changing the Chart Type
Although the Pivot Table and PivotChart Wizard cre-
ates stacked bar charts by default, you aren’t limited
to column-style charts. If you right-click any data ele-
ment (such as a bar) in the pivot chart and choose
Chart Type, Excel allows you to switch to any of its
standard types.
Excel won’t let you build an XY scatter chart, a
bubble chart (very similar to a scatter chart), or
a stock market-style (high/low/close) chart
from data in a pivot table. Because pivot
charts are built on pivot tables, those three
types of charts aren’t available.
Continuing with the example in this Technique, drag
all the fields off the chart, drop Salesperson on Drop
Categories Here, and drop Amount on Drop Data
Items Here. Then right-click one of the bars and
choose a pie chart. The result is in Figure 41-7.
• Figure 41-7: Pie charts are very easy and quick, too.

As is the case with pivot tables, you can use Page
fields to create different reports for different
slices of data. For example, if you
 Remove all the fields from the chart.
 Drag Salesperson back to Drop Category
Fields Here.
 Drag Fruit to Drop Series Fields Here.
 Drag Quantity to Drop Data Items Here.
 Drag Farm to Drop Page Fields Here.
 Click the down arrow next to Farm.
 Select just the farm in Thailand.
You get the result in Figure 41-6.
• Figure 41-6: The quantity of fruit sold in Thailand. Elapsed
time: 30 seconds.
If you alter the data in a pivot table, you need
to update the chart so that it reflects the data.

If you added rows to your list, those new rows
might not be included in the pivot chart. To be
sure, go back to the pivot table that your chart is
based on (perhaps in the sheet called Sheet1),
click inside the pivot table, choose Data➪
PivotTable and PivotChart Report, and move
back in the wizard to Step 2, where you choose
the location of your list. Update the location

Gussying Up Pivot Charts
293
Gussying Up Pivot Charts
The number-one complaint about pivot charts:
They’re ugly. Ugly, ugly, ugly.
After you have a pivot chart that you can live with,
your first order of business should be to get rid of
those (did I say U-G-L-Y?) field buttons — the ones
with names like Salesperson and Sum of Amount.
To get rid of the field buttons, right-click one of them
and choose Hide PivotChart Field Buttons. The field
buttons disappear.
With the field buttons gone, you probably
want to put a title on the chart as a whole and
also on the X and Y axes. To do so, right-click
a blank location in the chart and choose Chart
Options➪Titles (see Figure 41-8), type the
titles, and click OK. When the titles are in the
chart, right-click each and choose Format Title
to apply your own formatting.
To bring back the field buttons
1.
Choose View➪Toolbars➪PivotChart.
Excel brings up the PivotChart toolbar.
• Figure 41-8: Type your own titles after the buttons are
gone.
2.
On the PivotChart toolbar, click the button
marked PivotChart, and then clear the Hide
PivotChart Field Buttons check box.
You get the buttons back as well as the
PivotTable Field List.

Setting Scenarios
and Seeking Goals
I
t’s time to buy that condo. The whole family’s excited. You have a
price in mind, the lady at the bank said you could get a 30-year, fixed-
rate loan at a great percentage rate, and the only question is whether
you can afford the payments.
You spend an hour at the bank, run the numbers, and get the good news:
You have just barely enough income to cover the house payments —
if you can talk the seller into shaving $30,000 off the sales price.
You talk to your agent, who talks to their agent, and the other agent says
he doesn’t think they’ll take it, but you’re ready to roll the dice and make
an offer when . . . something happens. Maybe you see an ad for a cheaper
loan, or you see a house that you like better, or Great Aunt Tillie decides
that because you’re such a grand niece, she’ll give you $10,000. The big
question: How much will your payments be if this happens, or that hap-
pens, or something else comes hurtling down the pike?
If you need to figure out a loan payment, here’s a huge timesaving
tip: Don’t bother with Excel. Hop on the Web, type in the numbers,
and get the result — the correct result — in no time. Loan payment
calculating programs abound on the Web. Go to Google and 
search for loan amortization. Or try www.amo-mortgage.com/
amortization.html or www.hsh.com/calc-amort.html.
Here’s the hook — the way that Excel can really help. Nobody (at least
nobody I know) runs an amortizing program just once. Excel is a fantastic
timesaving tool when you need to play what if? When you’re curious
about amortization, you want to know how much your payments will be
if the rate goes up or down, or if the length of the loan gets longer or
shorter. In some cases, you know how much you can afford to pay every
month, but you need to work backward to figure out how much you can
borrow or what percentage rate you need to fight for. Excel can do that.
And how.
42
Technique

Building a Loan Amortization Spreadsheet
295
In this Technique, I show you how to

Compare multiple scenarios. These are differ-
ent sets of conditions so that you can tell at a
glance what the effect of, say, different interest
rates or shorter loan periods will be.

Tell Excel to work backward. Also called goal
seeking, you do this to determine what set of ini-
tial conditions will lead to a specific result. In the
case of loan amortization, you can tell Excel how
much you want to pay and ask Excel to figure out
how much you can borrow.
Building a Loan Amortization
Spreadsheet
To demonstrate both the scenario and goal-seeking
capabilities, I use the loan amortization calculation
spreadsheet in Figure 42-1. Here’s how to build it:
• Figure 42-1: The Loan Amortization spreadsheet used as
an example in this Technique.
1.
Start with a new, blank spreadsheet.
2.
In cell A1, type Amount of Loan. In A2, type
APR. In A3, type Years. In A5, type Monthly
payment. In A6, type Total payments. In A7,
type Total interest.
Your budding spreadsheet looks like column A in
Figure 42-1.
3.
In cell B5, type =-PMT(B2/12,B3*12,B1).
The formula’s basic structure, if you’re curious,
is =PMT(Rate, Nper, PV, FV, Type).
Cell B5 calculates the monthly payment by using
Excel’s infamous PMT( ) function.
You have to put an equal sign and a minus
sign (in that order) in front of the PMT( ) func-
tion because that function returns a negative
number. Yes, there’s a reason. No, you don’t
want to hear it.
You can read all about PMT( ) in online Help.
In the box that reads Type a Question for
Help, just type PMT, press Enter — and strap
on your hip-waders.
4.
In cell B6, type B5*B3*12.
That’s the monthly payment times the number of
months. Easy.
5.
In cell B7, type B6-B1.
This is the total amount paid minus the original
amount of the loan. The spreadsheet looks like
Figure 42-2.
• Figure 42-2: Almost ready — everything but the data.

Technique 42: Setting Scenarios and Seeking Goals
296
If the cells aren’t next to each other, hold
down the Ctrl key while you click each one.
3.
Choose Tools➪Scenarios.
Excel brings up the Scenario Manager (see Figure
42-3). The Scenario Manager notes that you
haven’t set up any scenarios yet.
• Figure 42-3: Set up your first scenario here.
4.
Click Add.
The Scenario Manager invites you to add a new
scenario (see Figure 42-4).
5.
Type a name for the scenario, make sure the
Changing Cells box correctly lists the cells 
you want to change in each scenario, and then
click OK.
In Figure 42-4, I type Bigger Loan so that I can
identify the scenario easily. The Scenario Manager
asks for values for each of the cells that are
allowed to change (see Figure 42-5).
6.
Type the values for each of the cells that are
allowed to change; then click OK.
The Scenario Manager reappears, this time with
your first scenario listed.
7.
Repeat Steps 4, 5, and 6 to put as many scenar-
ios in the Scenario Manager as you wish.
In Figure 42-6, I run three different scenarios.
6.
To make the spreadsheet more legible, select
cells B1, B5, B6, and B7 (hold down the Ctrl key
while you click), choose Format➪Cells, choose
Currency, and set them for two decimal places
and your favorite currency symbol. Click 
cell B2 and choose Format➪Cells, choose
Percentage, and set it to two or three decimal
places.
7.
In cells B1, B2, and B3, enter data for the loan
you want to amortize.
Don’t forget that B2 is a percentage. So, for exam-
ple, if you want to run an amortization at a 4.50%
interest rate, you must enter the APR as .045.
Figure 42-1 shows the amounts for a $200,000
loan at 4.50% over 30 years.
8.
Check your results.
Your spreadsheet should match the result in
Figure 42-1.
Establishing Scenarios
Amortizations are like potato chips. Nobody can run
just one.
If you want to compare many different combinations
of numbers — multiple scenarios, in the parlance —
Excel provides an excellent tool for the job. Here’s
how to use it:
1.
Figure out which numbers you want to change
each time you rerun the calculation.
The obvious choices for an amortization are 
the amount, APR, and length of the loan. But you
can run scenarios on any spreadsheet, and the
choices for variables might not be so obvious.
Give it some thought.
2.
Set up your spreadsheet with your first 
scenario — a baseline, if you will. Then select
all the cells that you want to be able to change.
I use the spreadsheet in Figure 42-1 for my base-
line, selecting B1 through B3 as the cells that 
will change.

Establishing Scenarios
297
• Figure 42-4: Add a scenario here.
• Figure 42-5: Set the values for the scenario. Note that
the numbers aren’t formatted, so don’t let
their odd appearance throw you.
8.
When you have enough scenarios to start look-
ing at the results, click the Summary button (at
the bottom).
The Scenario Manager brings up the Scenario
Summary dialog box, as shown in Figure 42-7.
9.
Select the Scenario Summary radio button and
make sure that the Result Cells box refers to
the cell or cells that help you make the best
comparison. Then click OK.
• Figure 42-6: Three scenarios, ready to compare.
• Figure 42-7: Choose the cell or cells with results that you
want to analyze.
In Figure 42-7, I choose cell B5 — the monthly
payment amount. Excel comes up with a
Scenario Summary, as shown in Figure 42-8.

Technique 42: Setting Scenarios and Seeking Goals
298
That’s where goal seeking comes in.
Sometimes you can just reconstruct your spreadsheet.
In the case of working backward from payments to
borrowed amount, all you have to do is figure out
what the PMT( ) function has to look like. I figure it’d
take me, oh, about an hour and a half to make sure I
got that right.
But if you have a spreadsheet that does the forward
calculation correctly, getting Excel to work backward
only takes a few clicks. Here’s how:
1.
Start with a spreadsheet that calculates the end
result correctly.
For a loan amortization, the spreadsheet in
Figure 42-1 works just fine.
2.
Click the cell that you want to set — your goal.
In this example, you know how much you can
afford to spend per month, which is cell B5.
3.
Choose Tools➪Goal Seek.
Excel brings up the Goal Seek dialog box, as
shown in Figure 42-9.
• Figure 42-9: Goal Seek lets you work backward.
4.
Tell Goal Seek what value you want to achieve
and which cell can be modified to achieve 
the goal.
• Figure 42-8: You might be surprised to see the effect of
shortening the length of the loan or
increasing/decreasing the APR.
The Scenario Summary produced by the
Scenario Manager is a genuine spreadsheet in
all respects. You can add or delete columns or
rows, graph it, or do anything that a normal
spreadsheet can handle.
Working Backward: 
Goal Seeking
Scenarios work forward from different starting
points: You tweak a few numbers, run the spread-
sheet, and see how the results change.
What if you want to work backward? That is, what if
you know the results, but you want to see what it
takes to generate those results?
In this Technique’s loan amortization example,
you might know the maximum amount that
you can afford to pay every month, and you
might know the APR, but you need to know
how much you can borrow. Or perhaps you
know how much you want to borrow but
need to know where the APR has to go in
order to hit monthly payments that fit your
budget.

Working Backward: Goal Seeking
299
In this case, the most I can afford to pay every
month (cell B5) is $1,250. I want Excel to find
how big of a loan will necessitate $1,250/month
payments, given a 4.50% APR and a 30-year term.
5.
Click OK.
Goal Seek takes less than a second to come up
with the correct answer — a loan of $246,701.45
at 4.50% for 30 years will result in monthly pay-
ments of $1,250 (see Figure 42-10).
Of course, you can ask Excel to Goal Seek
a percentage rate or a loan term by using
the same technique. Goal Seek is amazingly
powerful, fast, and very easy to use.
• Figure 42-10: In less than a second, Excel tells you how
big of a loan you can afford.

Technique
Using the Lookup
Wizard
E
xcel lookup tables make it easy to reach into a list and extract infor-
mation. (I talk about lists in Techniques 37 and 38.)
When most people think of lookups, the prototypical situation that
springs to mind is a part number lookup: Somewhere in your spread-
sheet you have a part number, and you want to look up the name of the
part. Equivalently, you might have Customer numbers and want to look
up the customer’s name, or Department numbers and want to grab the
name of the department. Look up a number. Get a description. You get
the idea.
Most people don’t realize that they can use lookups to cover spans of
data, too. My favorite example: tax tables. (Tax tables are those tables of
tax rates that any self-respecting, bureaucratic government uses to
decide how much you owe in taxes, depending on how much the stuff
you buy costs or how much money you make.) Instead of confining your-
self to a one-to-one lookup, you can have Excel cruise through a tax table
and pick up the tax associated with a certain sales amount or (ugh!)
income level.
This Technique shows you how to set up VLOOKUP and INDEX functions
the fast way (in other words, using the Lookup Wizard) so that you can
enter the known data and Excel fetches what you need automatically. I
explain how to search for a less-than-or-equal-to match (entries that are
less than or equal to a value you enter) or an exact match (entries that
equal a certain value). Yes, most people use a lookup for exact matches.
But you should remember that Excel is equally adept at gliding through
tables, which could save you a lot of time some day.

Setting Up the Lookup Wizard
Excel lookups fall into two categories:

A less-than-or-equal-to match: Tax tables work
that way. You might also find a comparative
match useful if you need to look up times or
dates. (See “Running a Comparative Lookup.”)

An exact match: This kind of lookup works great
if you have a list of part numbers and part
names, for example, or customer numbers and
customer names. Just feed the lookup a number,
and you get back a description. (See “Running an
Exact Lookup.”)
If you’ve never used Excel’s Lookup Wizard, you might
need to install it. To find out, in Excel, click Tools and
look for an entry called Lookup (probably at the bot-
tom of the Tools menu). If it’s there, the Lookup
Wizard is already installed, and you can skip to the
next section. If you can’t find Tools➪Lookup, you
need to install the Lookup Wizard. Make sure that you
have your Office 2003 CD, and then follow these steps:
1.
Choose Tools➪Add-Ins.
Excel shows you the Add-Ins installer dialog box
(see Figure 43-1). If you installed Excel with
default options, you didn’t get any of the add-ins
shown in this dialog box.
An Excel add-in is an adjunct to Excel that
solves a specific problem or group of prob-
lems. Microsoft doesn’t install the add-ins by
default because they take some room, and
they can clutter up Excel’s otherwise-svelte
appearance (ahem). You might want to con-
sider installing the Conditional Sum Wizard
while you’re here to make it easier to calculate
sums based on specific criteria.
2.
Select the Lookup Wizard check box and then
click OK.
You get a rather, uh, intelligence-inhibited mes-
sage that says the feature isn’t installed, asking
whether you want to install it. (D’oh! Why else
would you ask to install it?) 
• Figure 43-1: Begin installing the Lookup Wizard here.
3.
Click Yes to begin the installation.
Excel whines and whirs for a minute or so — it
might ask you to provide your installation CD —
and then nothing happens, and you automatically
go back to Excel. That’s a good sign. It means that
the Lookup Wizard has been installed. You can
make sure by clicking Tools: Lookup is undoubt-
edly now at the bottom of the list.
Primping a List for Lookup
Before you can run either an exact or a comparative
lookup, you must make sure that you have a well-
formed list ready for Excel to use:

Headings: The first row should contain
headings — text labels that describe the con-
tents of the column.

Blank rows: The list can have no blank rows.

Technique 43: Using the Lookup Wizard
302
With your lookup table in place, you’re ready to use
the Lookup Wizard.
Running a Comparative Lookup
In the preceding sections, I show you how to get the
Lookup Wizard installed and how to ensure that you
have a list that the wizard can understand.
In this section, I show you how to use the Lookup
Wizard to run a comparative lookup: that is, how to
have Excel look up a value in a list that is less than
or equal to an entry in the list. The example that I
use is a sales tax table — you type the amount of a
sale into the spreadsheet, and the lookup function
returns the amount of sales tax — but the same
approach works in many other situations.
If you want to run an exact lookup, follow the
steps in the next section.
In Figure 43-3, I set up a very simple spreadsheet for
use with the wizard. (I just took the spreadsheet in
Figure 43-2 and added text in cells E1 and E2, for the
wizard to use.) Anyone using the spreadsheet just
needs to type a sales amount in the indicated box,
and the tax table provides the appropriate tax.
• Figure 43-3: Type in the amount; retrieve the tax.

Sorting: If you’re going to look up individual
entries in the list (such as part numbers or cus-
tomer numbers), you want an exact match, and
the columns don’t need to be sorted. But if you’re
going to look up a range of numbers using a less-
than-or-equal-to comparison (as you would in a
tax table) — looking for a comparative match —
you must sort the column that will be used for
the comparisons. (To sort a column, click once
anywhere inside the column, and click the Sort
Ascending icon on the Standard toolbar.)
In Figure 43-2, I show the sales tax table for Fort
Collins, Colorado, whipped into a list that Excel can
work with.
• Figure 43-2: A sales tax table ready for Excel to use.
Tax tables are excellent candidates for Excel
comparative lookups because taxes are fre-
quently hard to calculate precisely. Many
locales have a set sales tax rate — say, 4.7% or
6.3% — but use odd round-off points, particu-
larly for smaller sales amounts. The IRS has
tax tables that confound those who create
them — much less those of us who have to
pay Uncle Sam’s piper. If there’s any chance
for confusion, use Excel’s Lookup Wizard on a
tax table rather than attempting to calculate a
tax directly.

Running a Comparative Lookup
303
Unfortunately, the Lookup Wizard is one of the worst
wizards in Office. It’s exceedingly difficult to under-
stand. Follow along closely.
Here’s how to use the wizard:
1.
Select the list that you want the wizard to use.
Using the list in Figure 43-3, I select the From, To,
and Tax columns of the list, starting at the head-
ings on the columns, down to the last row.
The From column is the one that drives the
lookup because Excel always matches the
largest number that is less than or equal to the
amount that it’s looking up. For example, in
Figure 43-3, a sales amount of 0.22 that’s
compared with the From column matches
0.18, so the lookup will return a value of 0.01
in the Tax column. An amount of 0.23 returns
0.02. An amount of 0.24 also returns 0.02.
And so on.
2.
Choose Tools➪Lookup.
The Lookup Wizard identifies the list that you
chose in Step 1 (see Figure 43-4).
• Figure 43-4: The wizard picks up the tax table.
3.
Change the range if necessary and then click
Next.
You see Step 2 of the Wizard, which could be the
most confusing wizard step anywhere in Office
(see Figure 43-5).
• Figure 43-5: The tough Lookup Wizard step.
4.
At the top, choose the column that contains the
value to find.
In this case, I want to look up the amount of tax,
which is in the column with the label Tax.
5.
At the bottom, if you want to have Excel look
for a range of numbers (as you do with a tax
table), choose the entry marked No Row Label
Matches Exactly.
Immediately, the Lookup Wizard hits you with
the Lookup Wizard dialog box (I’m not kidding;
see Figure 43-6) that asks you to type the value
to match. This is a ridiculously confusing dialog
box. Hold your nose and follow along.
• Figure 43-6: The wizard uses the number 99999 as a
placeholder.

Technique 43: Using the Lookup Wizard
304
• Figure 43-9: Tell the wizard where to put the results.
9.
Click inside the cell (F2 in this example)
that will contain the lookup formula (it’s a
monster), and then click Finish.
The wizard does the dirty work, depositing the
lookup formula in the cell that you specify (see
Figure 43-10).
• Figure 43-10: The formula that the wizard produced.
10.
Go into the lookup formula that the wizard cre-
ated and change the placeholder — the 99999
that you typed in Step 6 — so that it points to
whatever cell you want to use for input.
In this case, VLOOKUP(99999, . . .) should read
VLOOKUP(F1, . . .) because you want to use
whatever gets typed in the cell above to be used
to look into the table. The result should look like
Figure 43-11.
6.
For now, trust me by typing 99999 and
clicking OK.
You go back to Step 2, but now the bottom box
shows New Value – 99999 (see Figure 43-7).
• Figure 43-7: The placeholder goes into the wizard.
7.
Click Next.
You see Step 3 of the Wizard (see Figure 43-8).
• Figure 43-8: You don’t want the wizard to show all the
details.
8.
Tell the wizard that you want it to copy just the
formula to a single cell (select the radio button
of the same name); then click Next.
The final step of the Lookup Wizard appears (see
Figure 43-9).

Running an Exact Lookup
305
• Figure 43-11: Change the placeholder to point to the
actual input cell.
If you play with it a bit, you’ll see that this lookup
formula works.
The Lookup Wizard is a bear — but it beats
the living daylights out of trying to create the
VLOOKUP() formula by hand.
Running an Exact Lookup
In this section, I modify the procedure in the preced-
ing section just slightly so the VLOOKUP function
that you get matches entries in the list precisely.
Here’s how:
1.
Use the instructions in “Primping a List for
Lookup” earlier in this Technique to come up
with a list.
I have a sample list in Figure 43-12, consisting of
department numbers and names. Note that exact
lookup lists don’t need to be sorted and that the
department numbers can appear in any order at
all. Indeed, they may not all be numbers!
2.
Select the list, including the headings.
In the example, I select cells A1 to B8.
3.
Choose Tools➪Lookup.
You get Step 1 of the Lookup Wizard, as shown in
Figure 43-13.
• Figure 43-12: A sample for an exact lookup.
• Figure 43-13: Establish the range of the lookup list.
4.
Make sure that the wizard got the list right and
then click Next.
You see Step 2 — as in the preceding section,
this is an enormously confusing step (see
Figure 43-14).
5.
At the top, choose the heading from the column
that you want to appear as the result.
In this case, I want to feed the lookup a depart-
ment number and get back a department name,
so I choose Department.

Technique 43: Using the Lookup Wizard
306
• Figure 43-15: That horrendous function performs the
lookup.
• Figure 43-16: Get rid of the placeholder from Step 6.
That’s how an exact lookup works.
• Figure 43-14: The confusing step.
6.
At the bottom, make a mental note of what
appears in the box but don’t bother changing
it. Click Next.
The value that appears in the lower box is a
placeholder, and you will replace it later in this
section.
The wizard moves on to Step 3 (the options are
similar to those in Figure 43-8).
7.
Select the Copy Just the Formula to a Single
Cell radio button. Then click Next.
The final step of the wizard appears.
8.
Click once inside the cell that you want to hold
the looked-up value; then click Finish.
The lookup formula — actually an INDEX( )
function — should look like Figure 43-15.
9.
Go into the formula and replace the place-
holder value that appeared in Step 6 with the
cell that you want to use to perform the lookup.
In this case, I replaced the MATCH(1, . . .) func-
tion with MATCH(D1, . . .) (see Figure 43-16).

Getting PowerPoint
Settings Right
L
ike all the other Office programs, PowerPoint ships with the training
wheels down and locked. However, unlike the other Office programs,
one of PowerPoint’s default settings can leave old remnants of pre-
sentations hanging around, so anyone with a text editor can go digging
around inside your presentation file, unearthing earlier versions of what
you wrote. That’s something they didn’t tell you in PowerPoint school, eh?
With more and more companies relying on PowerPoint to summarize and
convey information (and more and more truly awful PowerPoint presenta-
tions rushing in to fill the void), it’s time for PowerPoint power users to
take their destiny into their own hands. In this Technique, I show you how.
Working through the Changes
PowerPoint scatters its settings through a handful of dialog boxes with no
rhyme nor reason that I can discern. So instead of trying to bring some
order to this inherently chaotic situation, in this Technique, I step you
through the dialog boxes and show you the changes that you need to
make to work more efficiently.
If you’re concerned about the why, read the text. If you’re only concerned
about the what, run through the setting changes in the figures.
Most of all, keep one thing in mind: PowerPoint is a great tool to help
you communicate your ideas in a concise, focused way. If your ideas
aren’t concise or focused, your presentation will show it.
Spend your time on getting the content right:

No amount of multimedia pizzazz or glitzy transitions can compensate
for the lack of substance.

Don’t waste your time — or your audience’s — on a PowerPoint slide
show that merely parrots your speech.

I rail against adaptive menus (personalized

boing-boing-boing — every chance I get.
Consider the topic railed again.
4.
Click the Close button.
Setting the View
The startup task pane — the pane that appears on
the right when you start PowerPoint — doesn’t do
much, particularly if you follow the advice in
Technique 46 and change your blank default presen-
tation. I say get rid of it:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪View.
PowerPoint brings up the View tab of the
Options dialog box (see Figure 44-3).
2.

If you have something worth saying, perhaps you
should just say it. In many cases, a PowerPoint
presentation detracts from the point you’re trying
to get across (see Figure 44-1).
• Figure 44-1: Seminal PowerPoint presentation,
November 19, 1863.
Blistering the Bouncing Menus
PowerPoint suffers from the same congenital defect
that afflicts Word, Excel, and Outlook: menus that
don’t stay put. If your menus are bouncing around,
do the following:
1.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Options.
PowerPoint brings up the Customize dialog box
(see Figure 44-2).
2.
Select the Show Standard and Formatting
Toolbars on Two Rows check box.
I talk about this setting in Technique 13. If you’re
running a monitor at 2048 x 1024 resolution and
you wear high-power reading glasses, you might
be able to see all the buttons on one row.
Anybody else needs two rows.

check box.

want to end with a black screen. However,
using an extra black screen only takes up
time.

Click OK.
Showing More Files
Like the other Office apps, PowerPoint shows you
only four files on the Most Recently Used list, which
appears at the bottom of the File menu. There’s no
reason to keep it so limited:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪General.
PowerPoint shows you its General tab of the dia-
log box (see Figure 44-4).
• Figure 44-4: My recommended General options.
2.
Run the Recently Used File List number up to 9
entries.
3.
Click OK.
Taking Back Control
PowerPoint borrows Word’s infuriating habit of auto-
matically guessing what you want to select, whether
you selected it or not. In addition, PowerPoint is lim-
ited to 20 undo’s — heaven only knows why. Here’s
how to take back control:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Edit.
PowerPoint brings up the Edit tab of the Options
dialog box (see Figure 44-5).
The Show Paste Options Buttons setting in this
dialog box controls whether PowerPoint shows
you a Smart Tag every time you paste. That
Smart Tag lets you strip off formatting from text
before inserting it, or apply formatting from the
presentation’s design template. Unless you have
a genetic antipathy to Smart Tags, keep the Tags.

Technique 44: Getting PowerPoint Settings Right

changes to the file . . . the deltas, as it were. So any
text that you delete, for example, remains in the file;
with Fast Save turned on, PowerPoint just makes a
note that you deleted the text. When you open the
file again, PowerPoint scurries along, gathering up
all these notations about what was changed during
the Fast Saves and modifies the file accordingly
before presenting it to you.
Back when people frequently saved their files to
floppy disks, Fast Save could save quite a bit of
time: PowerPoint wasn’t required to rewrite the
entire file when you asked to save it. Rather, the
program could just post these little notes on the
end of the file, knowing that it would all be put
back together when necessary.
Of course, anybody who opens a Fast Save
presentation with a text editor (or even using
Word’s Recover Text from Any File option; see
Technique 69) can read all the text inside the
file — including anything you thought you had
deleted.
Nowadays, the presence of a Fast Save option 
should send shivers down the spine of anyone
who deals with sensitive information — and the
fact that PowerPoint enables a Fast Save by default
is a ringing condemnation of Microsoft’s commit-
ment to protecting your privacy.
Sorry. My soapbox seems to be a bit well-worn.
To restore some sanity to PowerPoint:
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Save.
You see the Save tab of the Options dialog box,
as shown in Figure 44-6.
2.
Clear the Allow Fast Saves check box.
3.

Choosing the Right
PowerPoint 
File Type
We had 12.9 gigabytes of PowerPoint slides on our network. And I thought,
“What a huge waste of corporate productivity.” So we banned it. And we’ve
had three unbelievable record-breaking fiscal quarters since we banned
PowerPoint. Now, I would argue that every company in the world, if it would
just ban PowerPoint, would see their earnings skyrocket. Employees would
stand around going, “What do I do? Guess I’ve got to go to work.”
— Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
San Jose Mercury News, August 5, 1997
T
he fact that Scott McNealy banned PowerPoint throughout his com-
pany makes me wonder whether Microsoft did something right for
a change. (I’m not a big fan of Mr. McNealy; if he told me the sky
was blue, I’d go out and check.) But then I think back on all the utterly
abysmal PowerPoint presentations I’ve seen — the same ones, over and
over again, give or take a bullet point here or there — and it’s hard not to
sympathize with Scott’s position.
PowerPoint can suck up your time, bogging you down in seductive but
meaningless minutia. Or it can help you organize your thoughts, get the
words out, and get on with your working life. In this quick Technique, I
show you how to work with PowerPoint’s files — the first step to
PowerPoint recovery.
Understanding PowerPoint File Types
If you want to understand what’s happening with your presentations, you
have to understand what PowerPoint does with your files.
These are the three different kinds of PowerPoint files that most folks
bump into:

.ppt: These are normal PowerPoint presentation files. Double-click a
.ppt file, and PowerPoint opens the file so that you can edit it.

Saving Files to Run Automatically
315

.pps: These are PowerPoint show files. Double-
click a .pps file, and PowerPoint runs the
slideshow immediately.

.pot: These are PowerPoint template files.
Template files are typically used to create new
presentations (via the AutoContent Wizard) or to
apply formatting to an entire presentation (via
design templates). However, the templates work
just like regular presentation files. Double-click a
.pot file, and PowerPoint opens that file, too, so
that you can edit it.
Confused? No? Wait a second. You will be.
There’s really no difference between the three differ-
ent kinds of files. Sort of. See the following section.
If you go into Explorer, right-click a .ppt file,
and rename it with a .pps filename extension,
the resulting file is a perfectly legitimate, com-
plete PowerPoint show file.
To make things even more confusing, in different
places, you see PowerPoint refer to four different
kinds of .pot files — when in fact, they’re all basi-
cally the same:

Content template, which is just a presentation,
but the presentation typically contains only text
for some slide titles and bullets (see Figure 45-1).
• Figure 45-1: The Business Plan content template.

Presentation template, which is identical to a
content template in every respect.

Design template, which usually contains fancy
master slides but no real presentation (see
Figure 45-2).
• Figure 45-2: The Globe design template.

Presentation design, which is identical to a
design template in every respect.
If you use PowerPoint very much, I bet you’ve
lost hours trying to figure out what’s going on
with all the different kinds of templates and
files. The fact is that there’s no real difference:
They’re all the same kind of file, just used in
slightly different ways.
You can waste a lot of time fretting over the different
kinds of files. Or you can save a lot of time by using
the file types to your advantage.
Saving Files to Run
Automatically
In the preceding section, I explain that there is no
difference between plain PowerPoint .ppt files and
PowerPoint .pps show files. And now, the obligatory
exception: When you double-click a .ppt file in
Windows, PowerPoint comes up with the file, ready

Technique 45: Choosing the Right PowerPoint File Type
316
If you ever lose your original .ppt file but you
still have a .pps file floating around (or if
someone sends you a .pps file), you can re-
create the .ppt file quickly and easily. Make
sure that Windows shows you filename exten-
sions (see Technique 1). Right-click the file,
choose Rename, and change the .pps exten-
sion to .ppt. That’s all there is to it.
Adding a Custom Presentation
Skeleton to the AutoContent
Wizard
PowerPoint’s AutoContent Wizard (see Figure 45-4)
walks you through creating a presentation. You can
launch the AutoContent Wizard anytime you start
working on a new presentation by clicking From
AutoContent Wizard in the New Presentation
task pane.
• Figure 45-4: The AutoContent Wizard.
The only problem with the AutoContent Wizard is
that you and about 200,000,000 other PowerPoint
users start with the same set of canned Microsoft-
endorsed presentation skeletons — and you
inevitably end up with a presentation that looks like
about 200,000,000 others.
If you create enough presentations or enough
people in your company create presentations,
sooner or later, you’ll come up with a skeleton
to be edited. When you double-click a .pps file in
Windows, PowerPoint runs the slideshow.
You can use that distinction to minimize the amount
of hunting and pecking that you need to do when
launching presentations:
1.
Create your PowerPoint presentation as usual.
2.
When the presentation’s ready, choose
File➪Save, saving it as you normally do.
That saves your presentation as a .ppt file.
3.
Choose File➪Save As.
PowerPoint brings up the Save As dialog box
(see Figure 45-3).
• Figure 45-3: The easy way to save a slideshow.
4.
In the Save as Type box, choose PowerPoint
Show (*.pps).
I usually stick ready-to-run presentations on my
desktop.
5.
Click Save.
You now have a second copy of the presentation,
saved as a show file. Double-click that file, and
PowerPoint runs your presentation immediately.
Realize that you have two copies of the same
presentation. If you make changes to one
copy, they won’t be reflected in the other. For
that reason, I adopt the general rule to not
open .pps files — I only open .ppt files.

Adding a Custom Presentation Skeleton to the AutoContent Wizard
317
of your own. That is, you’ll have a presentation
that hangs together the basic parts of what
you want to say in a way that won’t leave your
victims snoring. If you use this basic structure
for different presentations, you can save your-
self the task of revising the same file over and
over and instead store the presentation skele-
ton in the AutoContent Wizard, ready to fill in.
Putting that perfect custom presentation skeleton in
the AutoContent Wizard is surprisingly easy:
1.
Make sure that Windows shows you hidden
files and folders.
See Technique 1. You have to put the skeleton in
a hidden closet. I mean, folder.
2.
Strip the presentation down to a skeleton: what
points should go on which slide, where to put
graphs, and so on.
Be sure that you put any pieces that you always
want included — pieces of text, logos, or any
special formatting — into the skeleton (see
Figure 45-5). 
• Figure 45-5: A skeleton (what you might call a real
template) ready to be saved.
3.
When you’re happy with the skeleton, choose
File➪Save As.
PowerPoint shows you the Save As dialog box
(see Figure 45-6).
• Figure 45-6: Save it in your Office 2003\Templates folder.
4.
Navigate to your Templates folder.
On most machines, the Templates folder is
located at C:\Documents and Settings\
<your user name>\Application Data\
Microsoft\Templates.
If you can’t find the Application Data folder,
you didn’t tell Windows to show you hidden
folders (see Step 1)!
5.
Click Save.

Choose File➪New; in the New Presentation task
pane, choose From AutoContent Wizard (see

presentation will be available in the second step.
The AutoContent Wizard appears (refer to 
Figure 45-4).

Click Next.
The AutoContent Wizard moves to the
Presentation Type step (see Figure 45-8).

feel best describes your custom presentation
(Corporate, Projects, and so on). Then click Add.
The wizard responds with the Select

45-9). Don’t let the terminology throw you. As I
describe in the first section of this Technique,
there’s no difference between a presentation
template and a plain, old, everyday .ppt file.
9.
In the Files of Type box at the bottom, choose
Presentations (*.ppt).
10.
The presentation that you saved in Step 5
should be visible. Click it and then click OK.
Your presentation appears in the AutoContent
Wizard’s list (see Figure 45-10).

Changing Your
Blank Presentation
E
very Office 2003 (and Office XP) user needs to create a custom,
blank PowerPoint presentation.
Why? Because it’s the only method that Microsoft gives you to ensure
that all your new PowerPoint 2002/2003 presentation files are automati-
cally scoured to remove personal data. It’s a helluva note, but it’s true.
PowerPoint 2000 and earlier don’t even have the setting.
While you’re creating that new presentation, you might as well fill it with
whatever else you need in all your new presentations — a particular
design, a company logo, and even the last-edited date and slide numbers
that appear on each side.
Take the time to make these changes once and then rest assured that all
your new blank presentations will include the settings that you want —
and won’t include your personal information.
Understanding Blank Presentations
You create a new blank presentation in one of three ways:

Click the New icon, which is the first icon on the Standard toolbar.

Technique 46: Changing Your Blank Presentation
320
The only way that you can permanently mark
this check box for all new blank presentations
is to save your own Blank.pot, with the box
checked. Dang it. I’m sure that Microsoft ran
out of money when building Office 2003.
Creating a Bare-Bones
Blank Presentation
In the preceding section, I explain what a blank pres-
entation is and where your blank presentation lives.
In this section, I show you how to create and save
your own custom blank presentation — an exercise
that every PowerPoint 2003 (or 2002) user should
undertake.
If you have specific content — bullet points,
entire slides, canned text — that goes into most
of your presentations, consider adding that
presentation to the AutoContent Wizard by
using the steps in Technique 45. But if you have
a common layout, background picture, color
scheme, title, and the like that appears in most
of your presentations, you can save the most
time by making all those changes once and
saving the result as your blank presentation.
Here’s how:
1.
If you don’t have a blank presentation showing,
click the New icon on the left end of the
Standard toolbar to create a, uh, new blank
presentation.
The prototypical blank presentation looks like
Figure 46-2.
2.
If you want to use a specific design as your
default design, click the Design button on the
Formatting toolbar and choose a design from
the ones offered in the Slide Design task pane.
In Figure 46-3, I apply the Mountain Top.pot
design. That will become the default design in
all of my new blank presentations.
• Figure 46-1: One way to create a blank presentation.
No matter how you create a new blank presentation,
PowerPoint might or might not create a truly blank
presentation.
When you tell PowerPoint to create a new blank pres-
entation, PowerPoint looks in your Office\Templates
folder for a presentation called Blank.pot. If it’s
there, PowerPoint creates a clone of that presenta-
tion, delivering that clone as your blank presenta-
tion. (If you have no Blank.pot, you really do get a
blank presentation.)
Every PowerPoint 2003 (or 2002) user needs
to create a Blank.pot file. Microsoft goofed.
There’s a very important privacy setting called
Remove Personal Information from File
Properties on Save. Unfortunately, the ’Softies
didn’t think of any way to make that setting
apply to all your new presentations. You have
to remember to go into each presentation as
soon as you create it and mark this check box.

Creating a Bare-Bones Blank Presentation
321
• Figure 46-2: PowerPoint’s original blank presentation.
3.
If you have a specific piece of text, a picture
(such as a logo), or some other common element
that you want to appear on all the slides in new
blank presentations, follow the instructions in
the next section to modify the slide master.
Changes made to the slide master affect all slides
in all new blank presentations.
• Figure 46-3: Pick a default design here.
4.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Security.
PowerPoint brings up the Security tab of the
Options dialog box (see Figure 46-4).
5.
Select the Remove Personal Information from
File Properties on Save check box.
This keeps PowerPoint from saving personally
identifiable information in the PowerPoint file for
this presentation and every new blank presenta-
tion that you create (because this one will be
cloned for all new blank presentations).
• Figure 46-4: Security is the most important part of this
Technique.
Although the setting implies that PowerPoint
will remove information from File Properties,
in fact, selecting the check box here removes
some (but not all) information from inside
the file. For detailed information, see
http://support.microsoft.com/
?kbid=314800.
6.
Click OK.
7.
Choose File➪Save.
PowerPoint brings up the Save As dialog box
(see Figure 46-5).

Technique 46: Changing Your Blank Presentation
322
To make the changes to Blank.pot, make sure
you have it open.
2.
Click within the Title Area for AutoLayouts box
and make changes there to the format of the
title on every slide.
For example, you could change the font, make it
bold, or click and drag the box to resize it.
• Figure 46-6: The slide master for Mountain Top.pot.
3.
Click within the Click to Edit Master Text Styles
box and make changes there to the format of
the body text on every slide.
You can change font formatting (Format➪Font),
or the bullets (Format➪Bullets and Numbering),
or any other character or paragraph formatting.
4.
If you want a picture or drawing to appear on
all slides, choose Insert➪Picture or bring up the
Drawing toolbar ( View➪Toolbars➪Drawing)
and put the picture or drawing on the slide.
Note that you can use this approach to place text
in a text box on every slide: Just click the Text
Box icon on the Drawing toolbar.
5.
When you’re done making changes to the slide
master, choose View➪Normal and you return
to the presentation.
• Figure 46-5: Save your blank presentation.
8.
In the Save as Type box, choose Design
Template (*.pot). In the File Name box, type
Blank. Then click Save.
PowerPoint saves the presentation as Blank.pot,
in the correct location. (The name Blank.pot is
not case-sensitive.)
Using Slide Masters
Slide masters allow you to simultaneously change
title and other text fonts, bullets, and so on in all the
slides in a presentation. You can use slide masters to
format a single presentation in no time. Or make
changes to the slide master in Blank.pot to make the
changes stick in your current presentation and all
the slides in all new blank presentations, too.
Every presentation has a slide master. To make
changes to it
1.
Choose View➪Master➪Slide Master.
To see the slide master, you might need to click
the slide next to the number 1 on the left side.
PowerPoint brings up the slide master for the
presentation, along with the Slide Master View
toolbar (see Figure 46-6).

Using Slide Masters
323
If you’re working on Blank.pot, resume at Step 7 in
the preceding section to save the presentation.
Every presentation has a slide master that con-
tains pictures, formatting, and other items that
appear on each slide. Most presentations also
have title masters, which control the formatting
on title slides. For 99 percent of the people, 99
percent of the time, the fastest way to get your
work done is to ignore the title master. If you
want to change all the slides in a presentation,
change the slide master. If changing the slide
master messes up your title slide (or any other
slide in the presentation), just bring up the
offending slide and change it manually. Avoid
title masters. Avoid multiple slide masters.
You’ll get home earlier because of it.

U
h, honey, I need to give this presentation to the Board tomorrow
morning. Could you help me practice? Would you do that for me?
All you need to do is sit and listen and tell me where I screw up. . . .
No, I don’t expect to screw up all that much, but it helps if somebody 
listens while I practice so. . . .
Yes, I’m going to be talking about convertible subordinated debent. . . .
Oh, but you do know a lot about convertible subordinated debent. . . .
Uh, no, I don’t think it will put you to sleep. At least, I hope it doesn’t put
you to. . . .
No, you can’t listen to Norah Jones while I. . . .
Wait a sec. It says here in this book that I can record the presentation and
play it back. Never mind.
Using Recorded Narrations
If you really want to save time with PowerPoint, record a sound track so
that you don’t have to be present to give the presentation!
Recording a narrative to go along with your presentation is easier than
you think. Although you might not be interested in carrying the concept
to its natural conclusion — having the presentation deliver itself, writing
yourself out of the presentation entirely — recording a sound track can
save you time in several ways and hone your presentation:

Recording a practice presentation is a great way to go over the details
and work out the bugs. Every “ummm” and “uhhh” that you utter goes
into the recording, and the words that you speak get synchronized to
the slides. When you play the narration back, you can tell precisely
where you need to apply a bit o’ the blarney.
47
Technique

Creating a Narration
325

You really can record the entire presentation and
have it run all by itself — although you need a
fair amount of storage to hold the sound file, and
you probably don’t want to try running it over
the Internet.

If you have a presentation that delivers itself —
typically in a kiosk (see Technique 48) — even a
little bit of recorded sound can improve the pres-
entation tremendously.
If you have a microphone that Windows recognizes,
you have all the equipment that you need to record
a narrative for your presentation.
Creating a Narration
Here’s how to put together a narration for a
slideshow:
1.
Get the presentation set up the way that you
want it.
After you start the presentation, you can pause
the recording, but PowerPoint might have a hard
time keeping up if you pause recording and then
jump around to a slide that’s out of sequence.
Far better to keep it simple from the beginning.
2.
Click the first slide in the presentation.
3.
Choose Slide Show➪Record Narration.
PowerPoint brings up the Record Narration dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 47-1.
• Figure 47-1: Settings for the recording.
4.
Click the Change Quality button.
You see the Sound Selection dialog box, as
shown in Figure 47-2.
• Figure 47-2: Select a sound quality here.
5.
Select a sound quality from the Name drop-
down list box and click OK to go back to the
Record Narration dialog box.
If you’re going to play the sound through tinny
computer speakers, so-called Telephone Quality —
the lowest quality on offer — is good enough.
Choose CD Quality — the highest quality — only
if you have to compensate for a bad acoustic 
situation — and you have a lot of disk space to
hold the sound file. See the sidebar, “Recording
CD Quality Sound,” for more details.
Radio-quality sound suffices in all but the most
demanding (read: big auditorium, bad sound
system) circumstances.
6.
Click the Set Microphone Level button.
PowerPoint brings up a Microphone Check dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 47-3. (Surprisingly,
PowerPoint doesn’t use Windows’ microphone
tools.)
7.
Follow the instructions onscreen, speak directly
into the mike at a distance that you can maintain
while narrating the presentation, and then click
OK when you have the microphone working
right.

Technique 47: Recording a Sound Track
326
Allow a second or so of idle time at the begin-
ning of each slide to ensure that PowerPoint
associates what you say with the correct slide.
When you’re through narrating a slide, allow
two or three seconds before you click to go to
the next slide. Depending on the speed of
your computer, PowerPoint might clip the
sound at the end of the slide.
10.
Finish the presentation normally.
When you’re done, PowerPoint asks whether you
want to save slide timings along with the narra-
tions. Slide timings are an indication of how long
you spend on each slide while you’re practicing
(see Figure 47-4).
• Figure 47-4: Choose to save slide timings.
11.
Click Save or Don’t Save.
 Click Save if you want PowerPoint to run your
presentation automatically (that is, if you
want PowerPoint to be able to advance
through the slides without your intervention)
or if you want to keep track of how long you
spend on each slide.
 Click Don’t Save if you aren’t worried about
how long you’re spending on each slide and
you plan to run the presentation manually.
PowerPoint shows your presentation in Slide
Sorter view. If you saved the slide timings,
each slide’s duration appears to the lower left
of the slide, as you can see in Figure 47-5.
12.
Save your presentation by choosing File➪Save.
The narration gets saved, too.
The sensitivity slider at the bottom of the
Microphone Check dialog box adjusts itself to
pick up your voice. The position of the mike mat-
ters most. Get it close to your mouth and don’t
vary the distance from your mouth to the mike
when you test.
• Figure 47-3: Make sure that your microphone is working.
PowerPoint doesn’t use any of the built-in
Windows microphone tools. This box is the
only chance that you have to adjust sensitivity
of the mike for recording a presentation narra-
tive (er, slideshow narration).
If you’re going to do a lot of slide narrations,
it’s worth investing a few bucks to buy a high-
quality headset with a microphone. You can
more easily maintain the distance from mouth
to mike, which frees your hands and allows you
to sit back and relax while doing the narration.
8.
Leave the Record Narration dialog box
onscreen until you’re ready to go through
your entire presentation.
9.
When you’re ready, click OK and give your
presentation, speaking into the microphone.

Editing a Narration

• Figure 47-5: Slide timings appear below each slide.
Recording CD Quality Sound
If you’re recording CD Quality sound, select the Link
Narrations In check box at the bottom of the Record
Narration dialog box. If you don’t select this check box,
PowerPoint stores the recording for each slide inside the
slide itself. Although that leads to large .ppt file sizes, it
also means that your recording can’t get lost. If you do
select the check box, each slide’s recording is stored in a
separate .wav file.
The names of these separately maintained sound files are
quite odd. Recordings for the PowerPoint file called
myshow.ppt, for example, are stored in files with names
myshow.ppt256.wav
(for the first slide), myshow.
ppt257.wav, and so on. If you re-record the first slide, the
narration is stored in myshow.ppt256-0.wav.
Playing a Narration
To play back your narration

If you told PowerPoint to save your slide timings,
choose Slide Show➪View Slide Show and stand
back. PowerPoint goes through the entire pres-
entation, precisely the way you recorded it.

If you didn’t have PowerPoint save your slide tim-
ings, choose Slide Show➪View Slide Show. The
first slide appears, and your narration begins to
play. PowerPoint waits for you to advance to the
next slide by clicking normally before playing the
narration that goes along with it.
Editing a Narration
To re-record a narration for an entire presentation,
use the steps in the preceding section, starting at
the beginning.
PowerPoint also makes it easy to re-record the narra-
tion for a single slide, but with a trick:
1.
Select the slide that you want to re-record.
You can do that in Normal or Slide Sorter view.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Record Narration.
PowerPoint responds with the Record Narration
dialog box. (Refer to Figure 47-1.)
3.
Adjust the recording quality, if desired; when
you’re ready to re-record the narration for the
slide, click OK.
PowerPoint shows you a smaller Record
Narration dialog box that gives you the 
option of re-recording the narration for the 
entire presentation, or just for the specific slide
(see Figure 47-6).
• Figure 47-6: You can pick up the recording at the
beginning of any slide.

Technique 47: Recording a Sound Track
328
PowerPoint records over the beginning of the
narration for the next slide. Blech.
When you press Esc, PowerPoint asks whether
you want to save the slide timings. (Refer to
Figure 47-4.)
7.
Click Save to save the new timing for the 
re-recorded slide.
8.
Save the presentation.
The re-recorded narration is saved along with it.
4.
Click the Current Slide button.
PowerPoint throws away the narration for the
current slide (as well as its slide timing), displays
the slide that you selected, and starts recording.
5.
Re-record the narration for the slide.
6.
Here’s the tricky part: You have to press the
Esc key before you move on to the next slide.
If you mess up and advance to the next slide
(which is easy to do if the re-recorded slide
has animations) and then press the Esc key,

Making a
Presentation 
Run Itself
S
o the boss wants to have a TV at the entrance to the annual Board
Meeting, showing off all the company’s great achievements for the
year. Or your daughter accumulated a bunch of information for her
Science Fair project, but it looks really hokey scrawled out on a piece of
flimsy whiteboard. Perchance the folks at the local museum are showing
a great new exhibit, and they want you to come up with an audiovisual
(dare I say, multimedia?) teaser so that people don’t walk right by, think-
ing that it’s more of the Same Old Stuff. Or maybe you have an extra table
at the local trade show, but nobody to stand there and give the same
presentation, over and over.
Why shell out the money — and spend the time — to get a television with
a continuous-looping tape or DVD player? You have all the tools that you
need with PowerPoint. And in this Technique, I show you how.
Choosing Self-Running Transitions
People think of self-running PowerPoint presentations as kiosk
slideshows — the kind of simple touch-screen application that you’ve
no doubt run into (and cursed over) in your local airport or mall. In fact,
self-running presentations work great in many settings that have nothing
to do with kiosks.
Every PowerPoint presentation can be coerced into running itself. If you
can get PowerPoint to do something, you can tell PowerPoint to do it
without any interaction at all — from you or anyone else. In effect, your
presentation turns into a super screen saver, capable of running anima-
tions, playing sounds, even running the voice-over narrations that I
describe in Technique 47.
On the other hand, you can create a PowerPoint presentation that’s con-
trolled by the person viewing the presentation, limiting him to very sim-
ple controls over when slides advance — or even which slide comes up
next. In this case, too, the presentation can take full advantage of all the
features that PowerPoint has to offer. On the third hand, you can easily

 It disables all the mouse functions during the
presentation — except clicking action buttons.
 It disables all the PowerPoint keyboard func-
tions during the presentation except pressing
the Esc key, which stops the presentation.
 It tells PowerPoint to treat the first slide of the
presentation as the next slide after the final
slide. For example, if you put a Next action
button on the final slide of a presentation,
when you click it, PowerPoint loops back to
the first slide. If you put a Back action button
on the first slide of a presentation, click it, and
PowerPoint moves to the last slide.
• Figure 48-1: Self-running presentations are kiosk
presentations.
5.
Click OK.
Your presentation is ready to run itself.
To run the presentation in kiosk mode, choose Slide
Show➪View Show.
The only way to stop a continuously looping
presentation from inside PowerPoint is by 
pressing Esc. You can, however, invoke a 
higher authority: Press Alt+Tab to use 
create a presentation that freezes and can’t be
unstuck without, in effect, pulling the plug.
The trick lies in specifying a transition for each slide:

You can tell PowerPoint to move on to the next
slide after a specific amount of time passes —
the slide timing.

You can put one of PowerPoint’s predefined
action buttons on a slide to allow the viewer to
choose which slide to see next.

If you forget to assign a slide timing and you
don’t put an action button on the slide, the pres-
entation freezes on the unendowed slide: You
can’t move forward or backward!
Looping a Presentation
Continuously
To create a PowerPoint presentation that runs itself
1.
Make sure that you have the presentation itself
in good working order.
2.
Ensure that every slide either has a slide timing
(see the next section) or an action button (see
the concluding section in this Technique).
Every slide must have a way to move on to the
next slide. Otherwise, the presentation freezes.
PowerPoint doesn’t warn you or have any tools
that will reliably trap these black hole slides.
Some tricks do exist (see the next section), but
you’re basically on your own.
3.
Choose Slide Show➪Set Up Show.
PowerPoint shows you the Set Up Show dialog
box, as shown in Figure 48-1.
4.
Select the Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen)
radio button.
PowerPoint immediately selects and grays out
the Loop Continuously Until Esc check box. That

Getting the Slide Timings
Just Right
I explain in the preceding section why every slide
in a self-running PowerPoint slideshow must have
either a slide timing or an action button. The slide
timing setting for a slide tells PowerPoint how long 
it should wait before advancing to the next slide
automatically.
You have three absolutely foolproof ways to make
sure that every slide in a presentation has a valid
slide timing:

Add a narration to every slide in the presenta-
tion (see Technique 47), and make sure that you
click Save when asked whether you want to save
slide timings.

Run a rehearsal timing all the way through
the presentation. During a rehearsal timing,
PowerPoint keeps track of how long you take
to go through each slide and saves that timing
along with the slide.

Manually apply a slide timing to each slide. This
is the least desirable approach because it’s hard
to guess how long each slide will take — and
because you might forget to assign a timing 
to one slide, thus stopping your continuously
looping presentation dead in its tracks.
Applying slide timing manually
To manually apply slide timing
1.
Click the slide to which you want to apply slide
timing.
2.
Choose View➪Task Pane, click the down arrow
at the top of the task pane, and then select
Slide Transition.
PowerPoint brings up the Slide Transition task
pane, as shown in Figure 48-2.
• Figure 48-2: Set the slide timing here.
3.
Under Advance Slide, select the Automatically
After check box; then set the number of sec-
onds in the list box there.
In Figure 48-2, I set the slide to advance automati-
cally after 10 seconds.
Slide timings and action buttons can work
together: You can tell PowerPoint to move on
to the next slide either when the viewer clicks
an action button or after a specific amount of
time has passed. If you want to allow both,
select both check boxes under Advance Slide.
4.
In most cases, you want to set the timing for
only one slide. However, to be absolutely sure
that every slide in your presentation has a slide
timing, you should click the Apply To All Slides
button at least once.
I recommend clicking the Apply to All Slides
button once as kind of slide timing safety net.
That way, you can make sure that every slide
in a self-running presentation has an assigned
slide timing.

Technique 48: Making a Presentation Run Itself
332
4.
To pause the timer (and freeze the presenta-
tion), click the Pause button on the Rehearsal
dialog box — the one with two parallel lines.
When you pause the presentation, PowerPoint
simply stops the clock, so you can get up and walk
around before proceeding with your rehearsal. You
can resume the presentation (and continue the
timer) by clicking anywhere on the slide.
5.
To start all over again on a specific slide,
click the Repeat button — the one with the 
left-curbed arrow.
Doing so resets the timer for the current slide to
zero, resets the elapsed time for the presentation
to nullify the effects of the current slide, and
restarts the slide’s animation from the beginning.
Repeating doesn’t affect the timings for other
slides in the presentation.
6.
Finish the presentation normally.
When you leave the last slide, PowerPoint asks
whether you want to save the new slide timings
(see Figure 48-4).
• Figure 48-4: Make sure that you save the results of at
least one timing run.
7.
If this is a good timing run, click Yes. If you
want to ignore the results of this run, click No.
A missing slide timing will cause your presen-
tation to grind to a halt. You should click Yes
for at least one timing rehearsal to make sure
that each slide in your self-running presenta-
tion has a slide timing safety net.
PowerPoint returns to Slide Sorter view with
each slide’s timing showing below the slide, as
you can see in Figure 48-5.
5.
Click the X in the upper-right corner of the task
pane to get it out of the way. Or, select another
slide and repeat Step 3 to assign a timing to
that slide.
Adding timing settings with a rehearsal timing
When you run a rehearsal timing while you make the
presentation, PowerPoint keeps track of the amount
of time you spend on each slide. Follow these steps
to run a rehearsal timing:
1.
Be sure that your presentation is in its final form.
If the presentation is only half-baked, the timings
you record won’t reflect how the final presenta-
tion should unfurl. At the very least, every slide
that will appear in your final presentation should
be present before you run the rehearsal timing.
2.
Wait until you’re ready to go through the slide
show, allowing sufficient time for each slide.
If the slides have no action buttons, you must
allow enough time for a very slow reader to slog
through your brilliant prose.
3.
Choose Slide Show➪Rehearse Timings.
PowerPoint starts the slide show, placing a
Rehearsal dialog box in the upper-left corner, as
shown in Figure 48-3. The Rehearsal timer shows
you the elapsed time for this slide as well as for
the entire presentation. As you go through the
presentation, PowerPoint keeps track of how
much time you spend on each slide.
• Figure 48-3: The Rehearsal timer.

Adding Navigation Action Buttons

• Figure 48-5: Slide timings appear below and to the left of
each slide.
Adding Navigation
Action Buttons
If you want to allow the person viewing a self-running
presentation to move to the next slide or back to a
previous slide, the fastest and easiest way is via
action buttons.
Combine action buttons with lengthy slide
timings (see the preceding section) to give a
viewer the best of both worlds — either the
ability to move through your self-running
presentation quickly on command, or to view
at a more leisurely pace in a completely
hands-off way.
To place a navigation button on a slide
1.
Click the slide that you want to contain the
action button.
To place the same action button(s) on all slides
in a presentation, put them on the slide master:
Choose View➪Master➪Slide Master and follow
these steps.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Action Buttons.
PowerPoint brings up a panel of AutoShapes (see
Table 48-1). I talk about AutoShapes in Technique
11, and all the tricks there apply here.
If you click and drag the bar with the dots at
the top of the panel, you can tear off the
action buttons and keep them on your desk-
top.
3.
Click one of the six action buttons listed in
Table 48-1.
By default, the buttons in Table 48-1 work in self-
running presentations.
4.
Click and drag the cursor on the slide to draw
the button.
You draw action buttons just like any other
AutoShape (see Figure 48-6).
• Figure 48-6: Like AutoShapes, you can draw action
buttons anywhere on the slide.
The moment that you release the mouse button
while drawing, PowerPoint brings up the Action
Settings dialog box (see Figure 48-7). The specific
action that you get is keyed to the button. For
example, if you select the Back button, Previous
Slide appears in the Hyperlink To drop-down list,
as shown in Figure 48-7.
5.
Unless you have a burning desire to make your
life very complicated, click OK.
Yes, you can create a link to anyplace you like,
but in a self-running presentation, you almost
always want to accept the default action.
6.
Repeat Steps 3, 4, and 5 to draw additional
action buttons on the slide.
In Figure 48-8, I drew Previous and Next action
buttons — standard fare for self-running 
presentations that permit viewer interaction.

presentation itself, but one that pops up often enough. You wish you had
a few slides that you could show to answer the question. Sound familiar?
Maybe you’re going to pitch a proposal to the boss’s boss’s boss, and
you just know that she’s going to ask to see the details about a particular
point in the proposal. You don’t want to stick an extra slide in the show
to answer the question just because it’s so nit-picky and having a slide
like that as part of the presentation would slow down the pace. But, man,
if she asks that one question, you really want to have one super slide in
your hip pocket that nails the point beyond any question. PowerPoint
can do that. It’s easy. This Technique shows you how.
Planning for the Predictable
PowerPoint has come under a lot of criticism for making us stupid. Yale
professor Dr. Edward Tufte, the preeminent academic authority on 
presenting information, wrote an extended essay on the topic that
damns PowerPoint’s infuriating insistence on reducing

which, I hasten to add, are usually read verbatim by the presenter to a far
too-uncritical audience (www.edwardtufte.com).
NASA’s Columbia Accident Investigation Board placed part of the blame
for the space shuttle’s failure and loss of seven astronauts’ lives on
excessive reliance on PowerPoint: “When engineering analyses and risk
assessments are condensed to fit on a standard form or overhead slide,

supporting slide, it’s also easy to ignore it com-
pletely. When you’re done with the supporting
material, it takes only a click to return to the
main presentation.

When you print presentation handouts, you
can print the hidden slide (and any notes asso-
ciated with the slide) so that it shows up in the
order that you would’ve shown it if the slide had
been necessary.

You can’t lose what’s on the supporting slide.
It’s part of the presentation; it’s in the file. If you
distribute the presentation, the supporting slide
goes along.
Keeping supporting data available in the
PowerPoint file is particularly important for
crucial details (such as engineering data) that
might not make the cut for an executive pres-
entation but should nonetheless be available
for future reference. If you look at the
Columbia Accident Investigation Board report
cited at the beginning of this Technique, you’ll
see how supporting slides could’ve made a
world of difference.
Creating the Supporting Slide
Here’s how to ensure that the crucial explanatory
slide always sits in your (virtual) hip pocket:
1.
Identify a slide that needs additional support-
ing information.
I call such slides abridged. In Figure 49-1, I have a
slide that asks “Where do you live?” as one step
in determining the best Internet connection for
people living in Phuket. Having details about the
affected locations would be very helpful if any-
one in the audience should ask.
2.
Click the New Slide button on the Formatting
toolbar.
PowerPoint adds a new slide to the presentation
immediately after the abridged slide (see 
Figure 49-2).
information is inevitably lost” (CAIB report volume 1
page 191, www.caib.us).
PowerPoint doesn’t have to be that way. Your pres-
entation doesn’t have to be that way. With a bit of
planning and no small amount of care, you can cre-
ate a presentation that includes all the detail you
need to make a point or explain a complex situation.
And you can pull up that information if you need it in
the middle of a presentation, go through the sup-
porting information until your audience is satisfied,
and then return to the main presentation with a
mere click.
More than that, if you hand out printed slides
or notes, all that supporting information on
the hidden slides can be included, in
sequence, even if it wasn’t delivered live in the
presentation. Your audience can refer to the
supporting detail any time by looking at the
handouts.
PowerPoint doesn’t make people stupid. Stupid 
presentations make people stupid. You know what
I mean.
In general terms, here’s how to handle predictable
questions:
1.
Identify abridged slides in your presentation
that need additional supporting information.
2.
Create a supporting slide (or slides) that pro-
vides the additional information.
3.
Put a clickable link on the abridged slide that
hops to the supporting slide.
4.
Put a clickable link on the supporting slide that
goes back to the last slide viewed.
5.
Hide the supporting slide so that it doesn’t
show up in the presentation unless you specifi-
cally click the link and bring it up.
If you follow this approach

Displaying the supporting slide (or slides) is
easy and fast. However, if you don’t need the

If you need more than one slide to hold all the
information, see the next section.
• Figure 49-2: The new slide becomes the hidden,

4.
Add a Return action button that leads back to
the last slide you viewed.
I explain how to add action buttons in Technique
48. Last Slide Viewed is the default action for the
return action button. 
Right-click the return action button and choose
Format AutoShape. You can format it however
you like. Usually you want the button to be
very visible and easy to find when you’re deliv-
ering the presentation. You can put text on the
button by right-clicking and choosing Edit Text.
Then click OK to exit Format AutoShape.
Figure 49-3 shows what my return action button
looks like.
• Figure 49-3: Make the action button as conspicuous or
subtle as you like.
5.
Choose Slide Show➪Hide Slide.
When you hide a slide, PowerPoint doesn’t show
the slide during a normal presentation, but the
slide stays inside the presentation nonetheless.
You can tell that a slide has been hidden because
of the diagonal strikethrough icon on the slide
number in Normal and Slide Sorter view (see
Figure 49-4.)
6.
Click the abridged slide — the one that needs
this supporting slide.
7.
If the abridged slide already has a picture,
drawing, or block of text that you would like to
make into a link, right-click the picture, draw-
ing, or text placeholder, and then choose
Action Settings.

• Figure 49-5: Create a link to a hidden slide in the
presentation.
• Figure 49-6: Choose the supporting slide here.
Unless you make the link on the abridged
slide stand out, you might forget that a hidden
supporting slide is available! The only visual
cue that PowerPoint gives you during the pres-
entation is the mouse cursor: When you move
the mouse over a link, the cursor turns into a
pointing finger.
• Figure 49-4: In Normal and Slide Sorter views, a hidden
slide has a slashed slide number.
If the abridged slide doesn’t have a suitable
picture, drawing, or block of text available, you
can always put one on the slide. Alternatively,
you can make any text on the slide hot. (See
the procedure at the end of this section.) If
you want to use PowerPoint’s built-in
AutoShapes to create a link, choose Slide
Show➪Action Buttons, draw an action button
on the slide, and then continue with Step 11.
PowerPoint shows you the Action Settings dialog
box that you see in Figure 49-5.
8.
Select the Hyperlink To radio button and then
select the Slide option in the drop-down box.
You see the Hyperlink to Slide dialog box, as
shown in Figure 49-6.
9.
Pick the hidden supporting slide from the list
of slides on offer.
When creating a link to a hidden slide, the
slide number is in parentheses.
10.
Click OK twice.
11.
Save your presentation.
If you run the presentation, you see that the hidden
supporting slide never appears unless you specifi-
cally click the link (created in Steps 7 through 9) on
the abridged slide. When you’re done showing the
supporting slide, you can simply click the return
action button to return to the abridged slide in the
presentation.

In lieu of Step 10 in the preceding procedure, you
can turn plain text on the slide into a link for a hid-
den supporting slide:
1.
Select the text on the abridged slide that you
want to make hot.
You can choose any text, anywhere, anytime.
2.
Choose Insert➪Hyperlink.
PowerPoint shows you the Insert Hyperlink dia-
log box that you see in Figure 49-7.
• Figure 49-7: You can also create a hyperlink to the
hidden supporting slide.

In the Select a Place in This Document list box,
select the hidden supporting slide (look for the
parentheses).
5.
Click OK.
The hyperlink that you create behaves precisely the
same way as the link generated via the Action
Settings dialog box.
Running Several Supporting
Slides
In the preceding section, I talk about creating a 
single hidden supporting slide that connects to an
abridged slide in a presentation. That begs the obvi-
ous question: What if you have too much stuff to put
on a single supporting slide? You might need an entire
supporting presentation.
The easiest and fastest way that I know to set up a
hidden sub-presentation involves creating a custom
show, taking care to tell PowerPoint that you want to
show the custom show and then return to the
abridged slide that kicked it off.
To create a custom show and use it as a hidden sup-
porting show, follow these steps:
1.
Create all the slides in the supporting show.
Select each in turn and choose Slide Show➪
Hide Slide to mark each of the slides in the
show as hidden.
Because the slides have been hidden, none of the
slides in this supporting show will appear if you
run the normal slideshow.
Keeping track of a hidden custom show is 
easier if you group all the slides for the show
together and stick them all at the end of the
presentation.
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Custom Shows.
PowerPoint brings up the Custom Shows dialog
box.
3.
Click New.
You see the Define Custom Show dialog box, as
shown in Figure 49-8.
• Figure 49-8: Pick the slides and put them in order.

Technique 49: Answering Predictable Questions
340
If you forget to select the Show and Return
check box, when you reach the end of the hid-
den support presentation, PowerPoint forgets
that it was running a sub-presentation and just
ends everything!
9.
Click OK.
• Figure 49-9: Create a link here.
When you click the link on the abridged slide, your
hidden presentation runs, following the slide
sequence that you chose in Step 4. When the hidden
support presentation finishes, PowerPoint returns to
the abridged slide.
Slick. Fast. Easy.
Not all PowerPoint presentations are stupid.
4.
In the Slide Show Name field, type a name for
the custom slideshow. Then, one by one, click
the hidden support slides that you’ve created
and click the Add button to add them to the
custom show.
Rearrange individual slides in the show  by
clicking them in the Slides in Custom Show list
box and moving them up or down, clicking
the up-arrow or down-arrow buttons on the
far right.
5.
When you complete the hidden supporting
presentation, click OK, and then exit.
6.
Click the abridged slide — the slide that you
want to link to the hidden sub-presentation.
7.
Right-click the picture, drawing, or text in the
abridged slide that you want to make hot, and
then choose Hyperlink.
You can make just about anything hot. You can
also draw action buttons or put AutoShapes or
drawings on the slide that can then be made hot.
See all the examples in Step 10 in the preceding
section.
PowerPoint brings up the Insert Hyperlink box,
as shown in Figure 49-9.

Building toward 
a Goal
T
his Technique is all about content.
When you’ve seen as many bad PowerPoint presentations as I have, they
start aligning themselves into categories. I think Dante reserved the sev-
enth slide of PowerPoint hell for presenters who

Read ev-er-y stu-pid syl-la-ble directly from the slide. Presenters who
parrot their own pap don’t seem to realize that the audience skims the
important part of the presentation in the first three seconds each slide
appears and then promptly goes to sleep.

Give the entire presentation in the first two slides and then spend 40
minutes trying to fill in the gaps, haphazardly, jumping from topic
to topic.
Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch’entrate. . . .
(Translation: Abandon hope, all ye who enter . . .)
Inferno, Dante Alighieri, ca. 1308
I don’t think there’s any cure for the slide readers. Short of euthanasia,
anyway.
But there is a cure for the presentation that blasts all its thunder at first,
and then slowly, painfully fades away. You need to turn those presenta-
tions around; you need to build to a crescendo. Most presentations lend
themselves to gradually building up to one key slide, whether it’s a flow-
chart, a graph, or just another bunch of dull bouncing bullets.
The trick to building up to a finale? Create the goal slide first — the
slide you want to build up to — and then sprinkle copies of the goal
slide throughout the presentation, deleting the pieces that shouldn’t
appear in the penultimate version, then the preceding version, and so
on. By working backward, you not only focus your audience — you
focus your presentation.

Technique 50: Building toward a Goal
342
• Figure 50-1: Create your goal slide first.
• Figure 50-2: Duplicate the goal slide.
4.
Click the first slide in the presentation.
5.
Select the pieces of the goal slide that can be
removed and then delete them.
In Figure 50-3, I delete the lower-right corner of
the goal slide. That becomes the part of the goal
slide that I talk about in the presentation
between the two slides.
Reducing the Goal Slide
Take a minute and just think. Think about the point
that you want to make. Cut through the bull and the
explanations and the arguments. When your audi-
ence leaves the room, what do you want them to
remember? What do you want them to do?
That’s what goes on the goal slide.
If you can’t think of any straightforward, unambigu-
ous conclusion to your presentation, you haven’t
thought enough about what you need to say. Do
yourself and your audience a favor and call the
whole thing off.
When you do know what you want to say, cut to the
chase and create that goal slide. Here’s a great way
to make a goal slide with impact:
1.
Create the whole slide, lock, stock, and barrel.
Don’t worry about transitions. Don’t worry
about how you’re going to explain it. Just put
the slide together so you can work on it.
In Figure 50-1, I have one of my favorite slides —
a decision tree for choosing the best Internet
connection in Phuket, Thailand. Your goal slide
might consist of a graph or a sequence of bullet
points. The more visual, the better.
2.
Think backward. What part of your presenta-
tion leads to this point? Which pieces of the
goal slide will be discussed in the final slide or
two of your presentation?
You need to find a piece of the goal slide that can
be removed.
3.
Choose Edit➪Duplicate.
That puts a copy of the goal slide in your presen-
tation (see the left task pane of Figure 50-2), so
your entire presentation now consists of two
copies of the goal slide.

Reducing the Goal Slide
343
If your goal slide is just a list of bullet points,
you probably want to remove the last bullet
point. Typically, the last bullet point is what
you want to talk about before the complete
goal slide appears onscreen.
• Figure 50-3: I remove the part of the slide that I want to
talk about between the two slides.
6.
Again, think backward. What part of your pres-
entation leads to this snapshot of the goal slide?
You need enough material to cover two or three
traditional bullet-point slides in order to provide
the transition to this slide.
7.
Choose Edit➪Duplicate.
You now have three slides in the presentation.
8.
Click the first slide in the presentation.
9.
Select the pieces on this slide that can be
removed and then delete them.
Figure 50-4 shows how I worked backward.
10.
Repeat Steps 6–9, each time removing a piece
of the goal slide while you plot how you’re
going to get from slide to slide.
Figures 50-5 and 50-6 trace back the genesis of
this presentation.
11.
Save your presentation (if you haven’t 
already).
I discuss a second half to this building-backward
approach in the next section.
• Figure 50-4: Remove the next part of the goal slide.
• Figure 50-5: The earlier slide.

Technique 50: Building toward a Goal
344
Looking at Figure 50-7, I decide that the best way
to move from the previous slide (shown in Figure
50-6) to this one is by first showing the diamond
with the question Online How Frequently? and
then by showing each of the two given answers.
• Figure 50-7: Animate details of the transition between

3.
Select the first element that you want to appear
on this slide.
In Figure 50-8, I select the diamond with the ques-
tion Online How Frequently?
• Figure 50-8: Animate the first item that changes between
the slides.
• Figure 50-6: The first incarnation of the goal slide.
Building Forward
to the Goal Slide
In the preceding section, I show you how to build your
presentation backward from the goal slide. Before you
start adding all the slides with bullet points, you can
make the trip to your goal slide a bit more appealing
by adding simple animations. Here’s how:
1.
Click the second slide and choose Slide Show➪
Custom Animation.
In Figure 50-7, I select the second slide in the
series that leads to the goal slide and get ready
to animate it.
If you animate the transitions between these
slides that lead up to the goal slide, your audi-
ence will remember what you’ve said before,
they’ll understand how the intervening slides
relate to the whole presentation, and they might
even see how you’re building to a specific goal.
2.
Think about moving from the preceding slide
to this one: what elements get added? (Answer:
the ones you removed when you created the
preceding slide.) In which order should they
appear to emphasize that you’re building
toward a goal slide?

Building Forward to the Goal Slide
345
4.
Click the Add Effect button, choose Entrance,
and then choose an Entrance effect that
appeals to you.
In Figure 50-8, I use the Glide effect, which 
rapidly moves the diamond in from the left.
5.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each element that
appears first on this slide.
In Figure 50-9, after applying the Glide effect to
the diamond, I choose all the elements on the
top and apply the Glide effect to them. Then I
choose all the elements on the lower branch and
apply the Glide effect to them.
• Figure 50-9: First the diamond comes in, then the top
branch, and then the bottom branch.
6.
Click the Play button in the Task pane to make
sure the animation works the way you want.
7.
Save your presentation.
8.
Repeat Steps 1–7 for every slide in the series.
After you have the sequence leading up to the goal
slide, you’re ready to fill in the missing pieces: typi-
cally bullet-point slides that move from slide to slide
in a more-or-less orderly and understandable way.
If you follow this Technique, your audience will
stay with you — unless they fall asleep — and
they should walk away with a good idea of what 
you want them to remember and how you came to 
recommend it.
Don’t hand out a copy of the goal slide until
you show it on the screen. You’d just be giving
your audience good reason to ignore what you
say throughout the presentation.

 Fixing herky-jerky

Tripping the Light
Fantastic with
Multimedia
I
f your fondest memories of PowerPoint multimedia date back to the
time of postage stamp-size pictures that never managed to play right
during a presentation — well, you must’ve been working with Office
2000. How retro.
PowerPoint 2003 has the ability to bring Windows Media Player (WMP)
pictures — and audio tracks, too for that matter — directly into your
slides. Instead of relying on PowerPoint to play your movies, WMP itself
can take over.
The differences between native PowerPoint and Windows Media Player
formats are not nearly as substantial as you might imagine, and the
Windows Media Player implementation inside PowerPoint leaves much 
to be desired. But WMP does have a reputation for being much more 
stable than PowerPoint’s player, and you might see a difference in 
quality, particularly for high-resolution playback.
This Technique helps you choose the right player for the right job.
Choosing the Right Player
PowerPoint has a built-in media player that can handle most of the 
common file types, including most video standards (including MPG, AVI,
WMV, and animated GIF) and audio standards (including MP3, WMA,
WAV, and MIDI).
Windows Media Player, on the other hand, plays all of those kinds of files
and many more — so many, in fact, that if you have an odd file format,
you really need to try to open the file in Windows Media Player itself to
see whether it can figure out how to read the file.
You can put movies (and audio clips) inside your PowerPoint presenta-
tion with either of the two players. When you choose, keep these points
in mind:

Speed and ease: Using the native PowerPoint player is much easier
and faster. In fact, Microsoft’s first attempt to graft Windows Media
51
Technique

Inserting Multimedia with Native PowerPoint Tools
347
Player into PowerPoint (in PowerPoint 2003) has
the look and feel of an amateurish rush job.

Reliability: On the other hand, WMP has a repu-
tation for being far more robust than the internal
PowerPoint player. Whereas PowerPoint might
lock up or crash, WMP should keep cruising.

Video clips with a slide: If you want to play a
video clip immediately when a slide appears, you
have no choice but to use the native PowerPoint
player — WMP movies have to be started manu-
ally. More than that, if you use WMP, the initial
shot of the movie on the slide looks bizarre, and
you get a distracting sliding bar across the bot-
tom of the clip.

Compatibility issues: If you take a presentation
from one machine to another and the versions of
Windows Media Player are different, you might
have compatibility problems, particularly if the
other machine uses WMP 8 (the version that
shipped with the original version of Windows
XP) or earlier.
For most people on most PCs, I recommend using 
the native PowerPoint player, even though I’ve spent
years swearing at it. Microsoft hasn’t put much effort
into integrating WMP with PowerPoint, and it shows.
When you put a movie in a slide, the movie is
not embedded in the presentation. PowerPoint
keeps a link to the movie file. If you take the
presentation to a different machine, you have
to move the movie file — and put it in the
same folder location as on the original
machine. (Pack and Go, described in
Technique 52, moves the files for you.)
The fact that the movie is linked — not
embedded in the presentation — should also
give you a hint about the best way to speed
up a herky-jerky movie: Stick the movie on
some fast media that’s immediately accessible
to the PC that’s running the presentation, even
if you have to haul along a USB 2-based CD
or external hard drive. If you put the movie on
a network drive or a slow CD, you’re just beg-
ging for jerkiness.
Inserting Multimedia with
Native PowerPoint Tools
To run an MPEG (.mpg) movie in a PowerPoint slide
and let PowerPoint control how it’s shown, do the
following. You can use this same procedure to put
any other kind of multimedia content on a slide,
including sounds and GIF/JPEG pictures — even 
animated GIFs.
To download an MPEG file from the Internet
(instead of playing it), right-click the link and
choose Save Target As.

Create a new slide to hold the movie.
You can click the New Slide button on the

Inserting a Media Player Movie
If you decide to use Windows Media Player to run
your PowerPoint movie, here’s how to get the movie
into a slide:
1.
Create a slide for the movie.
The most common ways to make a new slide are
to choose Insert➪Slide or to click the New Slide
button on the Formatting toolbar.
2.
Type any text that you want to appear on the
slide.
The layout for the slide isn’t critical unless you
need to put text on the slide in addition to the
movie. In my example, I simply type a heading on
the slide and leave the rest of it blank.
3.
Choose Insert➪Object.
PowerPoint shows you the Insert Object dialog
box (see Figure 51-3).
4.
Add any text you like to the slide. When you’re
ready to bring in the movie, click the Insert
Media Clip icon in the lower-right corner. (It
looks like a video camera.)
PowerPoint brings up its Media Clip dialog 
box. This dialog box is sluggish (bordering on
comatose) because PowerPoint reaches out to
Microsoft’s Web site to haul in pictures.
PowerPoint ships with some truly insipid 
pictures but an enormous collection of won-
derful sounds. Fans of the www.tucows.com
shareware site might get a special kick out of
the audio clip Two Cows Moo.
5.
Click the Import button.
PowerPoint brings up the Add Clips to Organizer
dialog box.
6.
Navigate to the movie that you want to use and
then click Add.
Sooner or later, the Media Clip dialog box comes
back. Your movie should be the first item in the
organizer.
7.
Double-click the movie in the Media Clip dialog
box.
PowerPoint inserts the movie into the slide and
then immediately asks “How do you want the
movie to start in the slide show?”
8.
Assuming that you want the movie to start as
soon as the slide comes up, click Automatically.
The opening shot of your movie appears on the
slide, and it’s set to run as soon as the slide
appears during a presentation (see Figure 51-2).
You can pause the movie while it’s playing by
clicking it. Click again to resume play. After
the movie finishes, the last shot appears. If you
want to start the movie all over again, click it.

ou’re making a tight connection en route between New York and
San Francisco, and for some inexplicable reason, you leave your
laptop behind on the plane. And by the time you notice, the plane’s
on its way to Sydney. No big deal. The airline can radio the plane, and your
laptop will find its way back . . . except your PowerPoint presentation —
the reason why you’re flying from New York to San Francisco — is on the
laptop. Ooops.
A million things can and do go wrong with the best-laid plans. Your hard
drive crashes; Windows starts hiccupping with Blue Screens of Death;
somebody accidentally grabs your laptop and heads out the door;
PowerPoint just won’t start. You name it. Somebody’s suffered through it.
This Technique shows you how to get your presentation ready for any
eventuality . . . except the CEO who inevitably snores.
Packaging for CD
Any PowerPoint presentation that you take on the road should be backed
up in a very specific way. PowerPoint calls it Package for CD. I call it
Package for CYA. Microsoft did a good job with the latest version of
Package for CD, and it’s well worth your consideration.
Packaging a presentation for CD brings together all the parts of the presen-
tation (including linked pictures and weird fonts) in one quick operation.
Even if you aren’t headed out on the road, Package for CD is a good way to
make sure that you have everything backed up in your presentation.
Although this feature’s name is Package for CD, you can bundle all
the files together in a folder, whether you have a CD burner or not. I
talk about an important application of this approach in the section,
“Covering Your B...ases.”

3.
Type a name for the CD (or for the folder, if
you’re copying to a folder) in the Name the CD
text box.
4.
If you want to put additional PowerPoint files
on the CD, click the Add Files button.
I recommend keeping presentations separate,
just so they’re easier to find. But if you need to
burn one massive CD, you can accumulate
many presentations by clicking Add Files.
Although you can add a virtually unlimited num-
ber of PowerPoint files (.ppt and .pps files), you
cannot remove the presentation that you open in
Step 1 of this procedure from the list of files.
5.
Click the Options button.
The Package for CD Wizard shows you the
Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 52-3.
• Figure 52-3: Pick and choose only the files you need.
6.
If you know for an absolute fact that the PC you
will use to view the backed-up presentation(s)
has a copy of PowerPoint 2002 or 2003, you
can clear the PowerPoint Viewer (To Play
Presentations without Using PowerPoint) 
check box.
To package a presentation for CD
1.
Open the presentation.
In Figure 52-1, I have one of my favorite presenta-
tions open and ready to back up. All the pictures
show up in the presentation, and the file has just
been saved.
• Figure 52-1: Start with the final presentation.
2.
Choose File➪Package for CD.
PowerPoint responds with the Package for CD
dialog box (some would call it a wizard), as
shown in Figure 52-2.

Playing the Burned CD
353
PowerPoint 2002 is the version of PowerPoint
in Office XP. Because your presentation might
not look right with the older versions of
PowerPoint, I recommend including the
Viewer if the destination PC is running
PowerPoint 2000 or 97. 
7.
If you choose to include the PowerPoint
Viewer, you might set the CD to autoplay —
that is, you might want the presentations to
start as soon as the CD is inserted in the desti-
nation machine’s drive. If you do want the pres-
entation(s) to autoplay, select Play All
Presentations Automatically in the Specified
Order from the drop-down list under the
PowerPoint Viewer check box.
For most people, autoplay is overkill: The choice
Don’t Play the CD Automatically leads to less
confusion.
8.
Make sure that the Linked Files check box is
enabled.
This is one of the truly great features of the
Package for CD feature. If you select this check
box, the Package for CD routine goes out and
picks up all the media files (pictures, movies,
sound files, whatever) and sticks them in with
the presentation bundle. It also automatically
modifies all the links so the whole thing runs 
correctly the first time.
9.
When you’ve made all your choices, click OK.
PowerPoint returns to the Package for CD dialog
box (refer to Figure 52-2).
10.
If you want to burn the files to a CD, click the
Copy to CD button. (Otherwise, click Copy to
Folder.)
The wizard asks you to insert a CD and then
burns the files. You see the progress in the
Copying Files to a CD dialog box.
When the wizard finishes burning the files, it
asks whether you want to burn another copy to a
different CD.
11.
Click No if don’t want another copy; then click
Close to exit the Package for CD Wizard.
Playing the Burned CD
In the preceding section, I describe how to burn
your PowerPoint presentation on a CD.
If you choose to include the PowerPoint Viewer and
tell PowerPoint to autoplay the CD (Steps 6 and 7 in
the preceding section), all you have to do is insert
the CD in any Windows computer, and the 
presentation starts immediately.
If you didn’t include the Viewer, or if you didn’t
choose autoplay, or if autoplay is disabled on the
destination PC, when you insert the CD in the drive,
you get the Windows AutoPlay dialog box, as shown
in Figure 52-4.
• Figure 52-4: Windows doesn’t know how to handle the CD.

Technique 52: Taking a Presentation on the Road

The old Viewer — which shipped with
PowerPoint 97 and was used as late as Office
XP/PowerPoint 2002’s Pack and Go Wizard —
couldn’t handle any animation effects, high
quality graphics, picture bullets, automatic
numbering, or dozens of additional features.
To display these effects in PowerPoint 2000 or
later, you need the new viewer. If you use
PowerPoint 2003’s Package for CD Wizard, the
new Viewer comes along for the ride. You can
also download a free copy to run on systems
without Office 2003 by visiting Microsoft 
at www.microsoft.com/downloads/
details.aspx?FamilyId=428D5727-43AB-
4F24-90B7-A94784AF71A4. The new Viewer
doesn’t support any linked or embedded
objects in your presentations — even if the
linking simply runs out to Windows Media
Player to run a video clip.
• Figure 52-5: Another incredibly poorly designed
PowerPoint dialog box. 
Covering Your B...ases
If you’re headed out on the road with a presentation,
make sure that you have several fail-safe copies of
your presentation at hand:
The PowerPoint Viewer will not show linked or
embedded objects — including, most emphati-
cally, any multimedia video clip that uses the
Windows Media Player (see Technique 51). If
you need the PowerPoint Viewer, change your
presentation to use PowerPoint’s built-in 
multimedia player.
Here’s how to get the presentation going:
1.
In the dialog box in Figure 52-4, click Open
Folder to View Files Using Windows Explorer;
then click OK.
Windows Explorer shows you a list of the files,
similar to an Open dialog box.
2.
If the PC you’re using has PowerPoint 2002 (in
Office XP) or 2003, just double-click the presen-
tation file — the one with the .ppt extension.
PowerPoint on the destination machine kicks in,
with the presentation loaded and ready to go.
You do have filename extensions showing,
don’t you? If you can’t see the .ppt in the file-
name, refer to Technique 1 to see how to get
Windows to show filename extensions to you.
3.
If the PC you’re using has an older version of
PowerPoint or no PowerPoint at all, double-
click the PowerPoint Viewer, file pptview.exe.
The PowerPoint Viewer appears with its leg-
endary 250,000-line End User License Agreement
(okay, I’m exaggerating a little bit). Click Accept,
and the Viewer’s Open dialog box appears (see
Figure 52-5).
4.
Click the presentation you want to see and then
click Open.
The PowerPoint viewer shows your slideshow.
All your linked multimedia files come through
intact. They might run a little slow and 
herky-jerky — you’re pulling the data off a 
CD — but all the pictures should be there.


Run the Package for CD Wizard, burn a CD, and
stick the CD in your suitcase along with your 
socks — anyplace that’s nowhere near your 
laptop.

Run the Package for CD Wizard again but this time,
choose Copy to Folder (Step 10 in the procedure in
the first section of this Technique). Zip the folder
and then e-mail the zipped folder to yourself. You
get bonus points if you create a free Hotmail
account specifically to hold the presentation.

If you’re going to a location that’s on your com-
pany network, run the Package for CD Wizard a
third time, use Copy to Folder, and copy the
folder someplace where you can get at it.
Alternatively, if you can use a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) or SharePoint to get at a folder
when you’re on the road, tuck away a copy there.
Things go wrong. Remember the old admonition two
logs crossing? With PowerPoint, it doesn’t hurt to
have three.

Assimilating Access

Getting Access
Settings Right
A
s you use Access, you discover just how easy it is to get your work
done. Queries, forms, and reports make quick work of maintaining,
viewing, and printing out your data. However, you might need to
reset a number of default options each time you launch Access, and set-
ting things up can take as much time as the actual work.
Fortunately, Access lets you change default settings so that it looks and
responds the way you want from session to session:

Startup options control how Access looks each time you launch a 
specific database.

Environmental options determine how Access looks and responds 
to your actions in general.
Setting Access Startup Options
For the most part, Startup options allow developers to customize a data-
base, and you can set different options for each database. You don’t need
to make changes to the defaults, but in many cases, the folks using the
database can get their work done more quickly and accurately if you do.
If you’re building a database that only you will use, most of the Startup
options are overkill.
To set an Access Startup option
1.
Open the database with options you wish to set.
2.
Choose Tools➪Startup.

Changing Access Defaults
Access does a good job of anticipating what the
average user will need. However, the default settings
won’t please everyone. When you find yourself
repeatedly changing a particular setting, consider
changing it permanently.
Settings in the Options dialog box are sticky:
That is, Access continues to act that way until

Technique
Adding a Cover
Sheet to an 
Access Report
M
ost users and developers agree that Access has the best report
generator of any relational database management system
(RDBMS). With a little practice, it’s easy to use and can almost
always generate just the right format. Options aren’t always automatic,
but you can produce amazing results with just a few clicks.
For instance, many reports include a cover sheet that contains the
report’s title and other pertinent information to the report, such as the
date the report was run, the report’s author, and so on. You could go to
the trouble of creating a cover sheet in Word. That would require that
you print the appropriate number of copies and then manually insert a
copy of the cover sheet into each printed report.
However, you can save a lot of time and effort by adding the cover sheet
to the actual Access report, which is what I show you in this Technique.
The Northwind database is the sample database that Microsoft
includes with Access. If you would like a database to tinker with as
you follow this technique and haven’t yet installed the Northwind
database, choose Help➪Sample Databases➪Northwind Sample
Database. When Access asks whether you want to install the feature,
click Yes. You might need to put the Office 2003 CD in the drive.
Generating a Report
Before you can create a cover sheet, you have to have a report. The
cover sheet gets tacked on to the front of the report itself. To create a
custom report:
1.
Choose File➪Open.
Access displays the Open dialog box.
2.
Open the database file that you want to use to generate the report.

Generating a Report
365
If you want to use the Northwind database
(northwind.mdb), it’s probably located in
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\
OFFICE11\SAMPLES. Click through the security
warnings. (In particular, you have to click Open
when Access warns that “This file may not be
safe if it contains code. . . .”) If you get the fancy
lighthouse splash screen, click OK.
3.
Click Display Database Window (or press F11).
You see the Database window, as shown in 
Figure 54-1.
• Figure 54-1: The Database window for Microsoft’s
sample Northwind database.
4.
On the left, under Objects, click Reports. Then
click the New button on the toolbar.
Access shows you the New Report Wizard (see
Figure 54-2).
5.
At the top right, choose Report Wizard. From
the drop-down list, choose the table you want
to use. Then click OK.
In my example, I choose the Shippers table. You
see the first pane of the Report Wizard (see
Figure 54-3).
• Figure 54-2: Create a new report with the wizard’s help.
• Figure 54-3: Include all the fields in the Shippers table in

6.
Click the right-pointing arrow to move the
Available Fields that you want to include in the
report to the Selected Fields column.
In my example, I click the double-pointing arrow.
That puts all three fields in the report.
7.
Click Finish and then choose File➪Save to save
the report.
Access zooms through all the defaults in the 
wizard and generates a report (see Figure 54-4)
based on the data in the Shippers table.

Technique 54: Adding a Cover Sheet to an Access Report
366
2.
Double-click the report header section title bar
(anywhere on the line that reads Report
Header). Click the All tab of the resulting
ReportHeader dialog box.
Access shows you the report header’s Properties
dialog box (see Figure 54-6).
• Figure 54-6: Tell Access what to do after it prints the
report header.
3.
In the Force New Page drop-down box, choose
After Section.
After Section has four possible settings.
Choosing After Section forces Access to start a
new page after all the information in the report
header section is done — which is precisely
what any good cover page should do.
4.
Click the Print Preview icon (the one that looks
like a sheet of paper with a magnifying glass)
on the Report Design toolbar.
You see the report’s first page (see Figure 54-7),
which contains just the report’s title from the
report header section.
5.
Click the Close button.
Access goes back to design view.
• Figure 54-4: The Shippers report, with a heading but no
cover sheet.
Creating the Cover Sheet
When you create a report, the Access Report Wizard
automatically grabs a report title from the report’s
data source, using the table or query’s name, and
then prints the title at the top of the report’s first
page. It’s a start, but you can do better with a cover
sheet — and produce a far more professional report.
Quickly.
The information at the top of the report — in this
case, the title Shippers — is the report header. Now
that you have a simple one-line header, the next trick
is to transform that one-liner into a full-page cover
sheet, worthy of the name.
Here’s how:
1.
Choose View➪Design View to take Access into
design view.
The Shippers report from the preceding proce-
dure looks like Figure 54-5.
• Figure 54-5: The Shippers report in design view.

Formatting the Report Cover Sheet

• Figure 54-7: The data in the report header is now on a

In the following section, I talk about turning that nas-
cent cover page into an editorial wonder.
Formatting the Report 
Cover Sheet
After you have a custom report with a cover sheet
(see the preceding section), modifying that cover
sheet is quite easy.
Centering the report title
Say you want to center the report title:
1.
Make sure that Access is in design view (choose
View➪Design View).
You should be able to see the report header.
2.
Click once on the text box that holds the
report’s title.
In the example from the preceding section, that
text box contains the word Shippers.
3.
Click the Center icon on the Formatting 
toolbar.
That centers the title inside the text box.
4.
Click the right edge of the text box and drag
the text box so that it touches the right margin
of the report.
5.
Similarly, click the left edge of the text box and
drag it just a smidgen so that it touches the left
margin of the report.
The report header is centered, as in Figure 54-8.
• Figure 54-8: Center the report header.
6.
Click Print Preview on the Report Design 
toolbar.
The word Shippers is centered, as in Figure 54-9.
• Figure 54-9: The report title is centered.
7.
Click the Close button.
Access goes back to design view.
You can use this technique to quickly center
any content between the left and right mar-
gins. You can modify the text, font, or almost
any property, and Access will center it properly.
However, if you change the report’s margins,
you must adjust the width of the text box
accordingly.

4.
In the Toolbox, click the Label control (it looks
like Aa).
5.
Click and drag inside the report header to 
create a new label.

ate a second label by entering February 2004.
• Figure 54-11: Add your own labels to the cover sheet and

both ends of the label box to the margins of 
the report.
8.
Click Print Preview.
Your budding cover page looks like the one in
Figure 54-12.
• Figure 54-12: The beginnings of a brilliant cover page.
Adding text to the cover sheet
To add new text to the cover sheet, simply insert a

1.
Make sure that Access is in design view (choose
View➪Design View).
You should be able to see the report header.
2.
Click at the bottom of the report header ( just
above the Page Header line) and drag it down.
That opens up more room for you to work on the
report header.
3.
If you can’t see the Toolbox (see Figure 54-10),
choose View➪Toolbox.
The Toolbox contains all the Access controls —
in this case, the items you can put in an Access
report.

ccess reports aren’t just for printed reports. They can also help
you analyze and summarize data — quickly — whether you ever
print them or not.
This Technique shows you a fast, easy way to put running totals in a
report. (A running total is the sum of the current record’s value plus 
similar values in all preceding records.) Running totals often help pin-
point data discrepancies or trends, and they’re a great way to get a 
feeling for why a specific total turned out so high — or so low.
Access makes it very easy to display running totals, subtotals, and totals
in a report based on criteria that you choose. With a little extra work, you
can create reports that others can use to identify, and possibly even solve,
problems quickly.
Adding a Running Total
Displaying a running total is a simple way to track the progress of a par-
ticular value from record to record. You can also use groups to have even
more control over how the totals appear.

in the drive. Then follow the steps in Technique 54 for generating a
Shippers report.

Adding a Running Total
371
Using the Orders table in the Northwind data-
base, the example report shown in Figure 55-1
includes the OrderID, ShipCountry, and Freight
files.
• Figure 55-1: The bare-bones Orders report with the
three chosen fields.
2.
Choose View➪Design View to put Access in
design view.
Access shows you the report layout for Orders
(see Figure 55-2).
• Figure 55-2: Design view for the Orders report.
3.
If you can’t see the Toolbox (Figure 55-3),
choose View➪Toolbox.
The Toolbox lets you draw a text box, which you
need to hold the running totals.
• Figure 55-3: Use the Toolbox to add the running total.
4.
Click the Text Box icon in the Toolbox (the one
that looks like ab|). Then in the Detail section,
click and draw a new text box to the right of
column where you want to add the totals.
I drew the text box next to the Freight box in the
Detail section.
5.
Immediately click the box that reads Text11
and then press Delete.
The Text11 box is a label, and it only gets in the
way. Your new text box looks like the one marked
Unbound in Figure 55-4.
• Figure 55-4: The new, unbound (and thus not yet
functional) running total text box.

Technique 55: Including Totals in an Access Report
372
• Figure 55-6: The Freight Running Sum Over Group tally
is in the final column.
Setting up groups
The Over Group setting evaluates all the Freight val-
ues in a group. But in this report there are no groups:
You haven’t set any. So, in this report, selecting Over
All and Over Group have the same results.
The running total behavior changes if, for example,
you have Access group the Freight charges by coun-
try. In that case, you get a subtotal for all the Freight
charges for shipments going to Brazil, another for
France, another for Germany, and so on. Groups can
help you run subtotals very easily after you have the
overall report set up. It’s also easy to change which
fields get subtotals by simply changing the groups.
To see the effect of adding groups
1.
Choose View➪Design View.
That puts you back in design view.
2.
Choose View➪Sorting and Grouping.
Access brings up the Sorting and Grouping 
dialog box (see Figure 55-7).
3.
Click in the box below Field/Expression and
choose the field that you want to use to group
the running totals (ShipCountry in my example).
That tells Access to run the report by country.
Access automatically chooses to sort in ascend-
ing order (from A to Z).
6.
Right-click the Unbound text box and choose
Properties.
Access shows you the Properties dialog box for
this text box (see Figure 55-5).
• Figure 55-5: Use the Properties dialog box to link this
text box to the Freight field and tell Access
that you want a running total.
7.
On the All tab, click the box to the right of
Control Source and then choose the name of
the column you want to add running totals to
(Freight, in my example).
8.
Click the box to the right of Running Sum and
then choose Over Group.
Here’s what all the Running Sum options do:
 No: This default setting displays only the
specified control’s current value.
 Over Group: Displays a running sum within
the current group. To use this setting, you
need to set a group, which I explain later in
this Technique.
 Over All: Displays a running sum over the
entire report.
9.
Choose View➪Print Preview.
Access shows you the running totals in the final
column (see Figure 55-6).

Displaying Subtotals and Totals
373
• Figure 55-7: Tell Access to group the orders by country.
4.
Click in the Group Footer box (under Group
Properties) and choose Yes.
You must create either a group header or
footer in order for Access to act on group
behaviors — including running totals. Without
a group header or footer, the running sum
won’t evaluate values within each group.
5.
Choose View➪Print Preview.
Access restarts the running total at the end of
each country (see Figure 55-8).
• Figure 55-8: Running subtotals appear by country.
The modified report displays a running sum, which
restarts at zero for each new country. Notice in
Figure 55-8 that the first group is Argentina, and 
the final tally for that country is $598.58. The next
record is the first Freight record for Austria, so the
running sum control resets itself and starts over,
evaluating only those Freight values in the Austria
group.
Displaying Subtotals and Totals
Many reports require subtotals and totals. In Access-
speak, these aggregate functions look at all the data
in a group or a report to produce a result. Adding
the numbers and counting the records are the two
most common aggregate functions.
The most peculiar thing that you’ll notice about
aggregate functions is that the same aggregate func-
tion returns different results depending on where
you put it within the report:

To evaluate all the values in each group: Place
an aggregate function in a group’s header or
footer.

To evaluate all the values in the report’s data
source (table or query): Place an aggregate func-
tion in the report’s header or footer.
Make sure you position the aggregate func-
tion in the right place to get the results you
want. 
To see how aggregate functions (including subtotals
and totals) work, start with a report that contains
running totals with groups, which I explain how to
setup in the preceding sections. Then add a sum( )
function thusly:
1.
Choose View➪Design View to go into 
design view.
Access shows you the report layout as modified
to this point (see Figure 55-9).

Technique 55: Including Totals in an Access Report
374
• Figure 55-10: The new, unbound subtotal box.
• Figure 55-11: With the =sum() aggregate function in the
ShipCountry footer, you get subtotals by
country.
The Freight cost for Argentina is $598.58. Notice
that the =sum( ) function’s results matches the
value in the running total column for the last
record in the same group.
To change the formatting of the amount, 
right-click the text box, choose Properties, 
and choose Currency from the Format drop-
down box.
As you might imagine, the same =sum( ) aggregate
function in the report’s footer will return a different
total. Here’s how to create one quickly.
• Figure 55-9: Display view for the Orders report.
2.
If you can’t see the Toolbox (refer to Figure
55-3), choose View➪Toolbox.
The Toolbox lets you draw a text box, which you
need to hold subtotals and totals.
3.
Click the Text Box icon on the toolbar (the one
that looks like ab|), and then click and draw a
new text box in the appropriate footer.
In this case, I want the subtotal to appear for
each country, so I draw a text box in the
ShipCountry footer, directly below the first
Freight box in the Detail section.
Make sure you don’t put an aggregate func-
tion in the Page section header or footer
because the function will return an error.
4.
Immediately click the box that reads Text12 or
Text13, delete the text, and type Total:.
The Textxx box is a label. Your new text 
box looks like the one marked Unbound in 
Figure 55-10.
5.
Click once inside the Unbound box and type
=sum(Freight).
6.
Choose View➪Print Preview.
The report (see Figure 55-11) contains totals for
each country.

Displaying Subtotals and Totals
375
1.
Choose View➪Design View to go into design
view. Click and drag down the area immedi-
ately below the Report Footer line.
That gives you room for a text box (see 
Figure 55-12).
• Figure 55-12: Make room for the grand total in the
report footer.
2.
Create a Total text box and a text box with the
=sum(Freight) formula in the Report Footer, as
described in the preceding steps.
You can copy and paste the text boxes if you
prefer. In my example, click the =sum(Freight)
box in the ShipCountry footer to select both
text boxes. (Yeah, that isn’t how good Windows
applications are supposed to work, but what
the hey.) Press Ctrl+C and then press Ctrl+V
to make and paste a copy. Then drag the two
new text boxes down to the Report Footer.
Reposition them if you like (see Figure 55-13).
3.
Choose View➪Print Preview.
Your grand total appears on the final page 
(see Figure 55-14).
• Figure 55-13: Copy the two text boxes to the report
footer.
• Figure 55-14: The first total is for Venezuela; the second
is for the entire report.
The first value at the bottom of the report, $2,735.18,
is the subtotal for the last group, Venezuela. That’s
the first sum( ) function in the ShipCountry group
footer at work. The second value is the result of the
sum( ) function in the report’s footer. That value rep-
resents the grand total of all the Freight values in the
report.
The same expression, =sum(Freight), returns
different totals in the same report depending
on whether the aggregate function is in a
group’s footer (for a subtotal) or the report’s
footer (for a grand total).

Printing Labels 
in Access
Y
ou might be showing your age if you remember when creating mail-
ing labels was the untamed office beast. After label sheets came
out, the task was somewhat easier because you could simply 
type up a template and then run the label sheets through the copier.
Unfortunately, you had no way to keep a list in strict order: New items
and updates had to be added to the end of the list because you couldn’t
insert them between existing items. Consequently, labeled envelopes
usually required additional sorting — particularly if you needed them in
ZIP code order. A small mailing wasn’t that horrible, but a large mailing
could take a full day.
Thanks to Microsoft Office, labels are no longer a problem. Access
includes a Label Wizard that turns your data into almost any label format
in seconds. The wizard hosts a variety of predefined labels based on
manufactured labels and also supports custom labels. You might already
be printing labels with Word, but if the data that you want to use is in
Access, it’s much faster and easier to print them.
Running the Access Label Wizard
The Label Wizard walks you through the process of creating labels step-
by-step. Before launching the wizard, you should know the label dimen-
sions, brand name, and product number.
The Label Wizard isn’t just for mailing labels. You can also use this
wizard to produce labels for name tags, file labels, DVD labels, and 
so on.
Here’s how you print labels of any sort from an Access database:
1.
Choose File➪Open.
Access displays the Open dialog box.
2.
Open the database that you want to use.

Running the Access Label Wizard
377
If you want to experiment with these steps by 
following the examples in the figures, you can
use the Northwind sample database file that’s
included with Access, northwind.mdb. Click
through the security warnings. (In particular, 
you have to click Open when Access warns that
“This file may not be safe if it contains code. . . .”)
The Northwind database is probably located 
in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\
OFFICE11\SAMPLES.
The Northwind database is the sample data-
base that Microsoft includes with Access. 
If you haven’t yet installed the Northwind
database, choose Help➪Sample Databases➪
Northwind Sample Database. When Access
asks whether you want to install the feature,
click Yes. You might need to put the Office
2003 CD in the drive.
3.
Click Display Database Window (or press F11).
You see the Access main window.
4.
Choose Insert➪Report.
Access shows you the New Report wizard.
5.
From the list on the right, choose Label Wizard.
At the bottom, choose the table from the drop-
down box. Then click OK.
You see the first window in the Label Wizard (see
Figure 56-1).
• Figure 56-1: The Label Wizard supports all major
manufacturer’s labels by name and number.
6.
Select the label product number that matches
the labels you’re using and then click Next.
In my example, I choose C2163 (the name tag
label from Avery), which I’m using to create
name tags.
The Label Wizard’s second window appears.
7.
Choose the font you want and then click Next.
I choose Arial 20 point — a reasonable (if per-
haps small) choice for name tags.
The wizard moves on to the fields you want to
include (see Figure 56-2). Note that you can have
only one font for the entire label run, but the
next section explains how to override this.
• Figure 56-2: Choose fields and add text that you want to
appear on your labels.
8.
One by one, click each entry under Available
Fields that you want to appear on the labels,
and then click the right arrow (or double-click
the entry and it moves itself). Type any text
that you want to appear on all labels (includ-
ing, for example, a space between the first and
last name). When the labels look right, click
Next.
The wizard asks for sort criteria (see Figure
56-3).

Technique 56: Printing Labels in Access
378
If you give the report a name, you’ll be able to
find it in the Database window in the future. 
Fast, eh? But wait! You can make them look better.
See the next section for details.
Tweaking the Label
Wizard’s Results
Sometimes the Label Wizard does such a good job
that you can immediately print the report. Often,
though, a little of bit of tweaking goes a long way. 
For example, the name tags might look better with
the names and titles centered. And it might help to
reduce the size of the title so that the name is more
distinctive.
After you use the Label Wizard to create a report
(read the preceding section and refer to Figure 56-4),
here’s how to make these changes:
1.
Click the View icon (the first icon on the left:
the one that looks like a triangle, pencil, and
ruler).
I know, I know. Sometimes View is this icon, 
and sometimes it’s a magnifying glass. See 
the upcoming Step 10. And don’t blame me.
Outlook shows you the report in design view
(see Figure 56-5).
2.
To select a line, click anywhere inside it
(=Trim([FirstName] & “ “ & [LastName] for
example). To select multiple lines, hold down
Shift while you click the lines.
Access selects the whole line — in Access 
parlance, the control.
3.
Press and hold down the Shift key while you
click the second and third lines.
That selects all three lines.
• Figure 56-3: Sorting by multiple fields is easy.
9.
Select the fields you want to sort by and then
click Next.
Sorting the labels is especially handy when
you need to sort items by ZIP codes to take
advantage of bulk mailing rates (in the US, see
www.usps.com/businessmail101). Simply
sort by the ZIP code or appropriate postal
code field, and the labels are printed in order.
You get the final pain, er, pane in the wizard.
10.
Type in a name and then click Finish.
Access generates the report (see Figure 56-4).
• Figure 56-4: The name tags are ready to be printed.

Tweaking the Label Wizard’s Results
379
• Figure 56-5: The name labels in design view.
Arggh. In every Office application except
Access, you Ctrl+click to select multiple items
or Shift+click to select all the items in a list.
However, in Access design view (bless its
pointed head), you have to Shift+click to 
select multiple items.
4.
Apply any formatting you want by using the
Formatting toolbar.
I select all the lines and click the Center icon 
to center the contents of all three lines. I then
select the lines individually and apply bold,
change the point size of the title, and make
Woody’s Watch appear in Garamond instead 
of Arial (see Figure 56-6).
5.
To move down the text on the label, press the
down arrow on the keyboard a few times.
It’s hard to judge precisely, but pressing the
arrow a few times should line up the label on the
page reasonably well.
You can add a graphic to all the labels at this
point by choosing Insert➪Picture and then
picking the picture.
• Figure 56-6: Center the three label lines.
6.
Click Detail (immediately above the top label
line in design view) to deselect the text when
you’re done applying any formatting.
That deselects the three lines.
7.
Click the first line and apply whatever format-
ting you like to the name.
8.
Click the second line and format the Ttitle.
9.
Click the third line and format the company
name.
10.
Click the View button (the first button on the
left, which looks like a sheet of paper with a
magnifying glass).
Access shows you the newly reformatted name
tags (see Figure 56-7).
The labels look much better — and it only takes a
few clicks.
Print just the first page of the report on plain
paper (File➪Print, Pages From = 1, To = 1).
Then hold the printout over a blank page of
labels (or name tags) to see whether they line
up correctly. If they don’t, use the preceding
steps to move them around.

Technique 56: Printing Labels in Access
380
I’m using the Northwind database with the
Employees table, as I describe earlier in this
Technique.
3.
In the first pane of the Label Wizard, click the
Customize button (refer to Figure 56-1).
Access shows you the New Label Size dialog box,
as shown in Figure 56-8.
• Figure 56-8: Establish sheet and label dimensions here.
4.
Click New.
You get the New Label dialog box (see Figure 56-9).
• Figure 56-9: You can adjust every detail of the sheet’s
layout here.
• Figure 56-7: The results of the formatting in Figure 56-6.
When you’re ready to print, be sure to load
the label sheets before clicking the Print but-
ton or choosing another Print command.
Nothing worse than a runaway printer.
Creating Custom Labels
and Reports
In the preceding sections, I show you how to create
and modify a report that relies on a common Avery
label. That isn’t your only option. You might want to
print full sheets of labels and trim them to a size that
the Label Wizard doesn’t accommodate. You might
want to print a report, like a phone book or a stock
inventory list, with dimensions of your own choosing.
If you need custom labels or want to print a report
that doesn’t conform to the wizard’s preconceived
notions, don’t fret. The wizard can be coerced into
doing what you wish:
1.
With your database open, choose Insert➪Report.
2.
In the New Report Wizard, choose Label
Wizard and then pick the table or query that
you want to use for printing labels. Click OK.

Creating Custom Labels and Reports
381
In this example, I want to print labels that are 3 x
3 inches, two labels across, on a letter-size page.
The distance from the top of the first label to the
top margin of the paper is 0.3 inch; left and right
distances are 0.5 inch, with a 0.5-inch gutter all
around each label. Inside each label, I want to
reserve 0.1 inch of white space at the top and
left. (I don’t have any direct control over the 
bottom or right.)
You need to measure from the print margin 
of the paper to the edge of the label. If the
printer is set up with a 0.5-inch margin on 
the left and you tell Access that you want the
labels to appear 0.5 inch from the left margin,
the label itself lies 1 inch from the left edge of
the paper.
5.
Type a name for your label project in the Label
Name box. In the Number Across box, type the
number of labels that you want to appear in 
a row.
For my example, I name the labels Custom Name
Tags and type 2 as the number across.
6.
Fill in each of the dimension boxes (marked
0.00; refer to the bottom half of Figure 56-9)
with the appropriate dimensions.
Figure 56-10 shows the dimensions that I need
for this example. In particular, note that the left,
right, and top measurements are the distances to
the margin — not the distances to the edge of
the paper.
7.
Click OK and then click Close to go back to the
wizard.
8.
Continue with the wizard from Step 7 in the
first section in this Technique to finish the
labels. Modify the labels, if you like, as I
explain in “Tweaking the Label Wizard’s
Results” earlier in this Technique.
When I finish, my name tags should look like
those in Figure 56-11.
• Figure 56-10: Carefully enter the dimensions that you can
control; Access takes care of the rest.
• Figure 56-11: Name tags in a custom layout, six per page.
You might need to adjust the margins of the
paper. To do so, choose File➪Page Setup and
type the correct margins in the boxes.

Technique
Reducing Repetitive
Formatting Tasks
H
ow much time have you lost applying the same formatting, over
and over again?
Depending on your personal preferences — or your boss’s, for that 
matter — formatting forms and reports can take longer than building 
a database itself. It’s like a $10 horse with a $20 saddle: The database
might be trivial or strung together with baling wire, but if it looks good,
everybody will love it.
Time to turn things around. Time to get the fluff out of the way, so you
can concentrate on more important things.
This Technique shows you how to make broad, effective changes in min-
utes. Best of all, you can reuse what you’ve built for future projects with
similar requirements. Get the formatting right once, and you don’t have
to futz with it so much with your next project.
If you know the tricks.
Understanding Access Formatting
You can reduce the amount of time that you spend formatting forms and
reports by setting custom defaults and by using templates. With a little
thought, you can almost eliminate individual formatting tasks completely.
In a typical project, most time gets soaked up formatting forms and
reports. That’s what people see; that’s what has to look good. Access gives
you two broad approaches to go beyond typical line-by-line formatting:

You can change the default formatting for a specific kind of control.

You can create a custom form or report template that contains all the
formatting settings you need.
In either case, you can save a lot of time by applying bunches of format-
ting in one fell swoop.

Setting Custom Defaults
383
Setting Custom Defaults
All controls have a few default properties that deter-
mine their general appearance and behavior. For
example, all text boxes start out with the same font
and font size by default. Here’s how to see your cur-
rent defaults:
1.
Start Access and choose File➪New. In the New
File task pane, click Blank Database.
You see the File New Database dialog box, as
shown in Figure 57-1.
• Figure 57-1: Create a new database.
2.
Type a name for your new database and click
the Create button.
Your new database appears.
3.
On the left, on the Objects bar, click Forms.
Then double-click the line that reads Create
Form in Design View. Choose View➪Toolbox.
Access displays an empty form in design view,
with the Toolbox (see Figure 57-2).
4.
Click the Text Box icon in the Toolbox (it looks
like ab|) and then click and drag the cursor on
the form to create a new text box.
You get two boxes on the form, as shown in
Figure 57-3. For more on unbound text boxes,
read Technique 55.
• Figure 57-2: Setting custom defaults starts here.
• Figure 57-3: An unbound text box, with its tag-along
label.

Technique 57: Reducing Repetitive Formatting Tasks
384
Although the example that I use here is with 
a form, precisely the same approach can be
used with reports.
Fortunately, you can easily reset a control’s default
properties for the current form (or report). Starting
with the form that you created in the preceding 
section
1.
Click the Text Box icon on the Toolbox.
The Properties window turns into a Default Text
Box dialog box (see Figure 57-5).
• Figure 57-5: To change the defaults for all new text
boxes, click the Text Box icon in the 
Toolbox once again.
2.
On the All tab, get rid of one of Outlook’s most
annoying settings by scrolling down to Auto
Label and changing it to No (see Figure 57-6).
This gives the heave-ho to the tag-along label
that Access insists upon inserting every time it
creates a new text box.
5.
Right-click the text box and choose Properties.
You see the default properties for this new text
box form (see Figure 57-4). Take a little time to
look at all the different properties that every text
box has. (Might as well look at the All tab; the
other tabs don’t have much.) Consider whether
you want to change any of the properties.
• Figure 57-4: The properties for text box Text0.
Don’t close this form; you’ll be working with it in the
next section.
Changing defaults via the Properties window
Can you imagine resetting a number of those proper-
ties for each text box in a form? If there’s only a few,
it’s not that big of a deal, but a form with many text
boxes can consume a lot of time — unnecessarily.
You can change a default setting temporarily for just
the current form or report via the Properties sheet
(the box in the lower-right corner of Figure 57-4).
Subsequent controls of the same type, inserted into
the same form, apply your default setting, and not
the application’s defaults.

Setting Custom Defaults
385
• Figure 57-6: Getting rid of Auto Label.
3.
Make any other changes you like.
For example, I turn the Border Color property
from 0 to 255, and the font name from Tahoma 
to Arial Black.
4.
Click and drag inside the form to create a text
box with the new properties.
The results of my twiddling are in Figure 57-7.
The new text box looks very different from the
old one. All new text boxes after this point reflect
the new defaults.
You have to change the default properties
before you insert the text box. After the text
box is on the form, it’s too late: You have to
adjust the properties manually.
5.
Close the form when you’re done with it. If you
want to verify that the new default properties
stick, choose File➪Save to make sure that you
save your changes.
• Figure 57-7: Customize text box defaults how you want.
Remember to save changes to the form. If you
close the form without saving changes, Access
deletes all the custom default properties
you’ve set.
If you find yourself facing a form full of con-
trols that need the same property change or
changes, click the first control, hold down the
Shift key, and then click all the others one by
one. After the selection includes every control
you need to modify, open the Properties win-
dow and make the appropriate changes.
Access assigns the new settings to all the
selected controls. Don’t worry about resetting
an inappropriate property because the
Properties window will only display properties
that are common to all selected controls.
Changing defaults using an existing control
In the preceding section, I talk about setting default
properties by working with the default properties
dialog box.

Technique 57: Reducing Repetitive Formatting Tasks
386
3.
If you can’t see the Toolbox, choose View➪
Toolbox. If you can’t see the Properties window,
choose View➪Properties.
Access should look something like Figure 57-8.
• Figure 57-8: A new form with the properties window for
the background of the form itself.
4.
Change whatever background properties 
you like.
In Figure 57-8, I change the Back Color setting 
to 16777215 — Access programmer’s jargon for
white.
You needn’t memorize any weird color num-
bers. All of Access’s color properties boxes
allow you to click an ellipsis (...) and choose
from a wide array of colors. You can also set
very specific colors by using standard Windows
Red/Green/Blue or Hue/Saturation/Luminosity
numbers.
5.
Click the Text Box icon in the Toolbox and then
change whatever text box properties you want
to modify.
Predictably, I change Auto Label to No.
Here’s a different, usually faster, way.
If you make a control that has precisely the format-
ting that you want for all future controls of the same
type, simply click the control and choose Format➪
Set Control Defaults.
Similar to setting default properties via the
Properties window, this technique works for
only the current form or report. However, you
can share the custom defaults with another
form or report by copying the formatted con-
trol into another form or report. Then, with
the copied control selected, choose Format➪
Set Control Defaults.
Default changes made via the Properties win-
dow or by using the Set Control Defaults com-
mand do not change an existing control. Both
techniques work only for controls added after
you modify the default settings. 
Creating a Form Template
If you’re modifying default settings for one form or
report, you might need to do so for all the forms and
reports in the database. Copying the necessary for-
mats from one form to another is more work than
necessary. When a database uses the same form and
control formats throughout (and most do), you can
save yourself a lot of time by creating an appropri-
ately formatted template.
To create a form template
1.
Bring up the Database window.
Of the many ways to do this, the simplest is to
click Window and choose the window with the
database’s name.
2.
On the left, under Objects, choose Forms. At
the top, double-click Create Form in Design
View.
You see a new, blank form in design view.

6.
Click any other icon in the Toolbox to also
change that control’s properties.
The sky’s the limit.
7.
When you’re done, choose File➪Save As.
You get the Save As dialog box, as shown in
Figure 57-9.
• Figure 57-9: Give the form the name Template.
8.
In the Save Form ‘Formxx’ To box, type
Template.
Template is just a handy name that’s easy for 
you to remember. In fact, it can be anything.
9.
Click OK.
Access saves the new form.
10.
Choose File➪Close.
Access closes the new form.
11.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Forms/Reports.
Access brings up the Forms/Reports tab of the
Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 57-10.
12.
In the Form Template box, type the name of the
form that you used in Step 8.
In my case, it’s Template.
13.
Click OK.
You now have a template. See the following 
section for a description of how to use it.
I change only a few properties in this proce-
dure. You can change hundreds. There’s no
limit to the customization, and you can do it
for both forms and reports.
• Figure 57-10: Establish a template for forms.
Using a Form Template
In the preceding section, I show you how to create a
new form template called, uh, Template. (And who
says we aren’t creative around here?) This new tem-
plate made the background on all new forms white,
and it neuters text boxes so they don’t have tag-
along labels.
Here’s how to put the template called Template 
to use:
1.
Bring up the Database window.
Just click Window and choose the window with
the database’s name.
2.
On the left, under Objects, choose Forms. 
At the top, double-click Create Form in 
Design View.
You see a new, blank form in design view. Notice
that the new form is white (with polka dots) —
not gray.
3.
If you can’t see the Toolbox, choose
View➪Toolbox.

Technique 57: Reducing Repetitive Formatting Tasks
388

Alter the template called Template (the current
template form) by opening the form in design
view and making changes.

Change the database’s default form template to
Normal.

Create and specify a new template form.
The template in this example becomes the template
for all forms, but a database can contain more than
one template. Create a form or report with just the
right formatting and name it appropriately. When
you need that specific set of formats, open the tem-
plate form and immediately save it with a new name.
Then make changes to the renamed form. That way,
the template remains a template, and you get the
custom look you need for your new form.
You might create several databases that share
the same custom format styles. When this is
the case, don’t create new forms and reports
for each new database. Simply import the
form and report templates from an existing
data. To import a database object from
another database, choose File➪Get External
Data➪Import. Navigate to the appropriate
database file, select the database file, and click
Import. In the Import Objects dialog box, click
the appropriate object tab, highlight the form
or report, and then click OK. Access will then
import each selected item into the current
database. At that point, you need only to spec-
ify the correct form or report as the database
template.
4.
Click the Text Box icon in the Toolbox (it looks
like ab|), and then click and drag on the form
to create a text box.
Voilà! No tag-along label (see Figure 57-11).
• Figure 57-11: A white form and a label-less text box. 
Ah, heaven!
Every form you create hereafter (in this database)
will look like the one in Figure 57-11 until you do one
of the following:

Recycling Forms 
for Browsing and
Data Entry
U
sing an Access AutoForm feature makes it easy to create a form
that displays existing data and also lets you change existing data
or enter new data in a database. You can make forms that give you
complete control over the contents of your database. All it takes is a cou-
ple of clicks. That’s great . . . as long as you don’t make any mistakes.
Unfortunately, in the real world, having an omnipotent form like that can
be dangerous. More often than not, all you really want to do is look at your
data without changing it. Or you want to set up a form for data entry that
doesn’t let you trounce on any existing data.
You might think that you’d have to come up with those more-specialized
(and safer) forms by hand, in some sort of complicated process. Not so.
In fact, with a few clicks and a couple of lines of code (which I promise to
go through in minute detail!), you can set up one form to do all of that
and more.
This Technique shows you how.
Understanding the Forms
As long as you’re comfortable working with a form that can change the
contents of your database with a sloppy keystroke, nothing is wrong with
using that form. But if you’re a little less than perfect — or if you want to
give the form to someone else so that they can enter new data or review
existing data — you might not be so sanguine. And in many cases, you
might want to create a data entry form that doesn’t allow the entry clerk
to look at, or change, existing data.
If you use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) — and I show you how in
this Technique — it’s easy to set up a single form that

Starts out with full capabilities; you can add, delete, and edit data. 
I call this form omnipotent.

With one click, turns into a read-only form for the main entries, with no
possibility of modifying existing data or accidentally adding new data.

3.
Click Display Database Window (or press F11).
You see the Access main Database window, as
shown in Figure 58-1.
• Figure 58-1: The Database window for the Northwind
database.
4.
Under Objects, on the left, click Tables. Then
click whichever table you want to use.
In this example, I choose the Shippers table.
5.
Choose Insert➪AutoForm.
Access creates an AutoForm based on the fields
in the Shippers table. This first form — the
omnipotent one, Figure 58-2 — includes all the
orders that the selected shipper sent out.
• Figure 58-2: Use the first AutoForm to make any changes
to the database.

With another click, turns into a data entry-
only form, which can’t even be used to view
existing data.
In order to create the form, you must
1.
Start with the omnipotent form, bound to the
data in the database. (A bound form is one that
directly affects data in the database: Access
updates the database immediately when you
add, delete, or change data in the form.)
2.
Add a button to the form which, when clicked,
turns the main part of the form into a read-
only form.
3.
Add another button to the form which, when
clicked, turns the form into a data entry-
only form.
Creating the Omnipotent Form
In this section, I work with a sample form based on
(what else?) the Northwind sample database that
Microsoft ships with Access. To create an omnipo-
tent form in which you can add, delete, or edit data,
do the following:
1.
Choose File➪Open.
Access displays the Open dialog box.
2.
Open the database file you want to use.
If you want a database to experiment with, open
the Northwind database file, northwind.mdb. 
The database is probably located in C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\SAMPLES.
Click through the security warnings; for example,
click Open when Access warns that “This file
may not be safe if it contains code. . . .”
If you haven’t yet installed the Northwind
database, choose Help➪Sample Databases➪
Northwind Sample Database. When Access
asks whether you want to install the feature,
click Yes. You might need to put the Office
2003 CD in the drive.

6.
Choose File➪Save.
Access brings up the Form Save As dialog box.
7.
Type a name for the form and then click OK.
In Figure 58-3, I name the form Shippers.
• Figure 58-3: Name your AuroForm here.
If you have never used an AutoForm, you might want
to take this one for a spin:

To see how data entry works, click the naviga-
tion buttons at the bottom of the form. In partic-
ular, note that the two right-wedge-with-asterisk
buttons at the bottom of Figure 58-2 add new
records. You can see that the form allows you 
to change any data in the database, or to add or
delete records. The user interface in Figure 58-2
is anything but intuitive, but note that there are
three shippers, and the first one, Speedy
Express, has 249 orders.

To see what data entry mode looks like, choose
Records➪Data Entry. Figure 58-4 shows the
Shippers form in data entry mode. Note that
both the Shipper ID (at the top) and the OrderID
(in the left column) will be generated automati-
cally by Access.

To leave data entry mode, choose Records➪
Remove Filter/Sort. This returns your form to its
original, omnipotent capabilities.
• Figure 58-4: Shippers form in data entry mode.
Modifying the Form
In the preceding section, I show you how to create
an omnipotent form that you can use to modify, add,
or delete any data in your database. In this section, I
show you how to put two buttons on the form — one
for read-only and another for data entry-only — that
curtail its powers in very specific timesaving ways.
To put these buttons on the form’s header
1.
Use the steps in the preceding section to bring
up the Northwind database’s Database window.
On the left, under Objects, click Forms. On 
the right, right-click Shippers and choose
Design View.
Access brings up the Shippers form in design
view (see Figure 58-5).
2.
Choose View➪Form Header/Footer.
A Form Header area opens at the top of the form
(see Figure 58-6).

6.
In the Name field, type cmdReadOnly. In the

Shippers.
Your form looks like Figure 58-8.
• Figure 58-8: Change command button properties here.

3.
In the Toolbox, click the Command Button (it
looks like a rectangle), and then click inside
the form’s header section and draw a command
button on the left.
4.
When the Command Button Wizard appears,
click Cancel.
The new command button looks like the
Command7 button in Figure 58-7. (Command 
buttons get sequential default names.)
5.
If you can’t see the Properties dialog box for
the new command button, right-click the button
and choose Properties. Click the All tab on the
Command Button Properties dialog box.

ready for you to start writing programs for the
Shippers form (see Figure 58-10).
• Figure 58-10: Write the form-limiting programs in VBA.
9.
In the left drop-down list, pick cmdReadOnly.
Access gets ready for you to write a VBA 
program that runs when someone clicks the
cmdReadOnly button (the one now named Lock
Down Shippers). Two lines are generated auto-
matically. They look like this:
Private Sub cmdReadOnly_Click()
End Sub
10.
Add two program lines inside the program —
after the first and before the last — so that it
reads like this:
Private Sub cmdReadOnly_Click()
Me.AllowEdits = False
Me.DataEntry = False
End Sub
Details about the settings are in Table 58-1.
11.
Repeat Steps 9 and 10 similarly for
cmdDataEntry (the Enter New Records Only
button) and create this program:
Private Sub cmdDataEntry_Click()
Me.DataEntry = True
End Sub
The programs should look like Figure 58-11.
• Figure 58-11: Tell Access that the form cannot be used to
edit existing shipper records.
12.
Choose File➪Close and return to Microsoft
Access. When you’re back in Access, choose
File➪Close to close the modified form. Yes,
now you do want to save changes to the design
of the form.
At this point, the form is ready to use.

Using the Modified Form
After you add the two buttons that restrict your
form’s capabilities (which I explain how to do in the
preceding sections), the form is ready to use. Here’s
how:
1.
Use the steps in the preceding section to bring
up the database’s Database window. On the
left, under Objects, click Forms. On the right,
double-click the name of the form.
Access brings up your modified Shippers form
(see Figure 58-12).
As the form is now, you can edit data, enter new
records, or delete records at will.
2.
Click the Lock Down Shippers button.
Access will not allow you to modify the shipper’s
Company Name or Phone number. Everything
else can be modified — including, surprisingly,
the Shipper ID — and you can add new shippers
at will.

new shippers (see Figure 58-12).
• Figure 58-12: The Enter New Records Only button allows
you to create new shipper records, but
that’s it.

Creating Your Own
AutoFormat
F
ormatting can really have an impact on a reader. For example, 
when you read a financial report and you see a red number, you
know exactly what it means. (You must be looking at my checking
account.) Format a number red, and readers react even before they know
the whole story. They feel it before they see it and see it before they
understand it. Or sometimes formatting is just a matter of convention —
some companies or departments require certain types of data to look a
specific way.
In Access, an AutoFormat is a set of predefined formatting attributes or
styles — fonts, colors, backgrounds, box borders, and the like. Applying
an AutoFormat to an object assigns all those attributes to the object.
Regardless of why you need to format your data, don’t spend more time
than you must. Use the built-in AutoFormat feature to quickly apply any
number of format settings to a form or a report — and steal them when
you can. This Technique shows you how to pick the lock.
Applying an AutoFormat
Few AutoFormats will meet all your requirements, but they can greatly
speed up the way you format reports and forms. In general terms, the
fast way to formatting enlightenment goes like this:
1.
Create your form or report.
2.
Apply the AutoFormat that comes closest to what you want.
3.
Tweak the AutoFormat.
4.
Save it so that you can apply it again.
To start your career in AutoFormat larceny, do the following:

In Figure 59-1, I create a database called Steal
AutoFormats.mdb.
• Figure 59-1: Access’s Database window.
2.
On the left, under Objects, click Forms. On the
right, double-click Create Form in Design View.

design view (see Figure 59-2).
• Figure 59-2: Start with a new form.
3.
Click the Text Box control on the Toolbox (it’s
marked ab|); then click the form and draw a
text box.

Customizing AutoFormat Styles
397
Access shows you the AutoFormat dialog box
(see Figure 59-5).
• Figure 59-5: An AutoFormat wizard, of sorts.
7.
Click the first AutoFormat on offer, the one
called Blends, and then click OK. Back in
Access, choose View➪Form View.
Blends (see Figure 59-6) has a graduated color
in the background, a special shadow on the text
box, and simple (sans serif) font formatting.
• Figure 59-6: The Blends AutoFormat.
You’re only changing the formatting here —
not the function of the text box nor or the
function of the form. It’s only skin deep.
8.
Choose File➪Close to close the newly format-
ted form. Yes, you want to save changes to the
design of Form1. In the Save As box, give the
form a name (such as AutoBlends) and then
click OK.
Customizing AutoFormat Styles
In the preceding section, I tell you how to apply an
existing AutoFormat style. Applying an AutoFormat
can save you a lot of time if you can find one that fits
most of your needs.
Fortunately, you can add custom AutoFormat styles
by modifying one of the predefined styles or by cre-
ating a new one.
Any custom AutoFormat style that you create
will be available via the Form and Report wiz-
ards. That means you can format objects while
you create them by using your custom
AutoFormats.
Customization is the way to go if you have several
personalities to please or conventions to satisfy. 
You can create as many custom AutoFormats as you
need and then quickly apply the appropriate style
accordingly.
Although you can modify the built-in
AutoFormat styles, I strongly recommend
that you don’t. Aside from reinstalling Access,
you can’t reset an AutoFormat to its original
settings after you modify it.
You aren’t required to take all the pieces of 
an AutoFormat. You can pick and choose 
while you are modifying an element. From 
the AutoFormat dialog box, click Options to
make the Font, Color, and Border check boxes
appear (see Figure 59-7); then clear the check
box next to whichever attribute of the
AutoFormat style you want to ignore.

Technique 59: Creating Your Own AutoFormat
398
• Figure 59-8: Change formatting by modifying an existing

To create your own AutoFormat style
1.
Follow the steps in the preceding section to 
create a form with the formatting you like.
You can start with an existing AutoFormat, as I
did in Step 7 of the preceding section, or you can
tweak formatting manually. 
2.
With the form open, choose View➪Form View
to see how the form looks. Change the existing
formatting to create the look you want by right-
clicking the element and choosing colors or
alignments — or even choosing Properties and
setting whichever property amuses you.
For example, in Figure 59-8, I took the
AutoBlends form that I created in the preceding
section, right-clicked the Unbound text box, and
chose Special Effect➪Chiseled. That changed the
appearance of the box around the text box.
Go back and forth between form view and
design view, making sure that you have the
formatting you want for your new
AutoFormat. 
3.
When you’re satisfied, choose View➪
Design View.

Deleting Old Styles
399
Access returns to the AutoFormat dialog box,
and your new AutoFormat is available for use
(see the top addition to the list on the left of
Figure 59-11).
• Figure 59-11: Your new AutoFormat now works precisely
the same way as the built-in AutoFormats.
The Form and Report wizards use the current
AutoFormat styles, so changes that you make
to an AutoFormat will be reflected when you
next use one of the wizards. 
Deleting Old Styles
After awhile, you might acquire a rather large list 
of AutoFormat styles and want to delete obsolete
styles. To delete an AutoFormat style, open any 
form in design view. Then do the following:
1.
Choose Format➪AutoFormat.
Access opens the AutoFormat dialog box (refer
to Figure 59-11).
2.
Click the AutoFormat that you want to delete.
3.
Click Customize.
You see the Customize AutoFormat dialog box
(see Figure 59-12).
• Figure 59-12: Delete any AutoFormat (even a built-in
one) here.
4.
Select the Delete <style name> radio button
and then click OK.
The AutoFormat is gone for good.
Because Access allows you to delete a built-in
style, be careful! Access won’t ask you to con-
firm the selection (er, deletion), so after you
click OK, the style is truly gone.

Inserting a
Spreadsheet 
in a Document
I
f you’ve never tried to put a piece of an Excel spreadsheet in a Word
document, you’re in for a bit of a surprise. You’d think it would be 
easy to get the right piece of the spreadsheet into the document and
that little things, like resizing the spreadsheet and its contents, could be
accomplished with a minimum of fuss and bother. Well, you’d be wrong.
Word and Excel get along like dogs and cats. You have a few key decisions
to make that basically determine whether cats rule and dogs drool, or
vice versa, if you know what I mean. In most cases, it’s probably best to
avoid mixing the cats and dogs entirely, and just copy and paste. But that
has its problems, too.
There are four quick ways to get the job done, and this Technique helps
you choose a method that will give you the right results.
Choosing an Insertion Method
The four basic ways to put Excel spreadsheet-like data in a Word docu-
ment are

Forget about Excel completely. Use a Word table instead. The big
advantage to this approach is that it’s easy to use Word’s extensive for-
matting and content-management tools if you go native. (For example,
you can draw new cells in the table with the Draw Table command; or
you can use table data in an index or cross-reference.) The big disad-
vantage is that you don’t have any of Excel’s tools, including such sim-
ple things as reliable totals (which are abysmal in Word) — not to
mention all the great charting and data analysis capabilities.
If your data is already in an Excel spreadsheet, you have quick ways
to get it out and into Word. If you put your data in a Word table, you
can move it over to Excel fairly reliably and easily, although stray cells
can cause enormous headaches. 
Technique
Save Time By

way to get spreadsheet
data into a doc
 Getting the right hunk of

 Resizing the spreadsheet
and formatting data for
legibility

Technique 60: Inserting a Spreadsheet in a Document
404
document to the spreadsheet is live in the sense
that every time you update the spreadsheet, Word
draws data from the current version. Microsoft
calls this approach linking, for obvious reasons.
This approach is great if you already have a
spreadsheet with the information that you want
to stick in your doc. It’s also the only game in
town if you want to manipulate the data directly
in Excel without having the hassle and overhead
of going through Word, and then have the results
of your shenanigans show up immediately in the
doc. But using linking also means that you have
to move the spreadsheet whenever you move the
document if you want the latest version of the
data. And formatting the data inside Word can be
an enormously frustrating, time-consuming, uh,
user experience.
No one method is inherently better than the other.
Save yourself some time and heartache by taking a
close look at the examples in this Technique. Chances
are good you will find something that works — but
keep the noted problems in mind when something
goes bump in the night.
No, you aren’t going crazy. Word works this way.
Copying Data
If you don’t need to reuse the data inside
Excel and have the changes reflected directly
inside the doc, you’ll save a tremendous
amount of time if you keep it simple: Copy
the numbers across either as a Word table or
as a picture.
Here’s the easiest way to copy Excel data into Word
and have the results appear in Word as a plain, ol’
everyday table:
1.
Open the Word document that will hold the
data.
2.
Open the Excel spreadsheet that has the data.
I bring up my Woodys Fruit Company Sales
spreadsheet.

Take a picture of a spreadsheet and put the 
picture inside the doc. Word and Excel make it
very easy to stick a picture of a piece of a spread-
sheet inside a document — you don’t need to
take a screenshot or use any other intermediary
program. The advantage to this approach is that
you know exactly what the spreadsheet will look
like inside the document. Any formatting that
you apply with Excel gets transferred faithfully 
to the picture — and thus into Word. After the
picture is inside Word, you can use Word’s tricks
to resize the picture, crop it, make it move with
text, float in the drawing layer (see Technique 11),
and so on. The big disadvantage is that you can’t
get at the data at all — to show updated data in
the Word doc, you have insert a new picture.

Build an Excel spreadsheet inside the doc.
Microsoft calls this embedding because the Excel
data lives inside the Word document. The only
way to get at the data is by going through Word
and then into Excel. The big advantage to this
approach is that you can use anything and every-
thing available in Excel to massage the spread-
sheet inside the document. Also, the data travels
with the document, so it can’t get lost. The big
disadvantage is that you have to crank up Word
and then go into Excel before you can get to the
data — and formatting the Excel spreadsheet
inside the doc can be a pain in the neck.
Word documents with embedded spreadsheets
can get huge. When I embed my sample 45K
Tax Table spreadsheet (see Technique 43) in a
20K Word document, the resulting document
balloons to 500K in size. Big documents like
that not only slow down everything, they also
tend to make Word unstable. You can mitigate
the problem by building the Excel spreadsheet
inside the document from scratch (see

Put a link to the Excel spreadsheet inside the
doc. In this approach, the spreadsheet is just like
any other Excel spreadsheet (er, workbook) —
you’ve just set up a link between the Word doc
and the spreadsheet that enables you to view the
spreadsheet in the Word doc. The link from the

Click inside the Word document where you
want the table made with the Excel data to go.
5.
Press Ctrl+V (or choose Edit➪Paste).
Word makes a valiant attempt to turn the Excel
data into a Word table (see Figure 60-2).
Note: The cell borders that you see in Figure 60-2
are table gridlines; they do not appear on the
printed page. I made Word show gridlines in this
figure — just choose Table➪View Gridlines — so
you can see the individual cells.
• Figure 60-2: A fair — but far from exact — copy of the
Excel data.
If you compare Figures 60-1 and 60-2 closely, you see
many of the good and bad points about copying data
from Excel into a Word table. Notably

The character formatting and table cell border
formatting carried over from Excel to Word with
no problems at all.

Cell size formatting, on the other hand, got
knocked for a loop. The height of the first row 
in Word is twice that in Excel.

The slanted diagonal line — the elbow — in cell
A1 wasn’t translated into a diagonal line in Word,
and the contents of cell A1 got mushed together.
In fact, the Country/Fruit entry in Excel’s 
cell A1 was transformed into a table inside a
table in Word — a potentially very confusing
situation.
If you work with the table a bit, you find that you can
format it in all the usual Word ways: borders, align-
ment, centering on the page, and so on. You can also
draw inside the table with Word’s table drawing tool.
Entries in the table cells are numbers — Excel’s
formulas don’t survive the leap to Word. If you
overtype one of the numbers in the table,
Word isn’t smart enough to recalculate totals.
The second way to copy data from Excel into Word
is to simply bring it across as a picture. Here’s how:
1.
Open the Word document that will hold the
data.
2.
Open the Excel spreadsheet that has the data.
3.
In the Excel spreadsheet, select the data that
you want to copy and press Ctrl+C (or choose
Edit➪Copy).
Refer to Figure 60-1.
4.
Click inside the Word document where you
want the table made with the Excel data to go.

Technique 60: Inserting a Spreadsheet in a Document
406
How good is the copy? If you print the original
spreadsheet and the copy in the document,
and then examine the two side-by-side, you
won’t be able to tell the two apart. It’s that
good.
The problem? The data didn’t make it into Word. The
copy in Word is a picture: You can click it, drag the
resizing handles, crop it, put it in the drawing layer,
and rotate it (see Technique 11), and generally do
anything to it that Word can do to a picture.
However, you can’t change the font size, or put bor-
ders around the cells, or add a new row, or do any-
thing that Word can do with tables. If you want to
reformat the data or redo calculations, you have to
change the data in Excel and copy the picture all
over again.
Note the option in Figure 60-3 to paste a link
to a picture of the Excel spreadsheet. If you
choose that option, you don’t get a picture —
you get a full-fledged link. See the “Linking a
Spreadsheet” section later in this Technique
for details.
Embedding a Spreadsheet
In the first section of this Technique, I talk about 
the four approaches to putting Excel data in Word
documents. Embedding is often the fastest approach
if you need to update the spreadsheet data, although
struggling with formatting might make you change
your mind.
Microsoft favors the embedded approach: Word’s
designers even put a button on the Standard toolbar
that lets you create embedded Excel spreadsheets
with a couple of clicks.
Of the many ways to embed spreadsheets in Excel,
these are the most common:
5.
Choose Edit➪Paste Special.
Word brings up the Paste Special dialog box, as
shown in Figure 60-3. The Paste radio button is
selected by default.
• Figure 60-3: Choose from various kinds of formatting for
the pasted data.
6.
From the As list, choose Picture (Windows
Metafile) and then click OK.
Word pastes a picture-perfect copy of the spread-
sheet into your document (see Figure 60-4).
• Figure 60-4: An amazingly accurate rendition of the
original.
If you compare Figures 60-1 and 60-4 closely, you
should be most impressed with the fidelity of 
the copy.

Embedding a Spreadsheet
407

Create the spreadsheet from scratch from inside
Word (the method demonstrated in this section).

Choose Insert➪Object, choose Microsoft Excel
Chart, and either enter the data manually (Create
New) or copy data from an existing spreadsheet
(Create from File).

Copy the spreadsheet cells to the Clipboard,
choose Edit➪Paste Special (refer to Figure 60-3),
choose Microsoft Office Excel Worksheet Object,
make sure the Paste radio button is selected (in
the Paste Special dialog box), and finally click OK.
Embedding an Excel spreadsheet inside a
Word document using any method other than
the build-from-scratch approach can produce
enormous .doc files. Big .doc files not only
make your machine work slower, but they also
make Word significantly less stable.
To create a new embedded Excel spreadsheet from
scratch
1.
Click the Insert Microsoft Excel Worksheet icon
on the Standard toolbar.
It looks like a spreadsheet with a big X on it.
2.
Move your mouse to cover the number of cells
that you want to appear in the document. 
Initially, Word limits you to four rows and five
columns (see Figure 60-5).
• Figure 60-5: Embed a 3 x 5 Excel spreadsheet in a Word
document.
3.
Click when you have the correct number of
cells.
The spreadsheet appears inside your document.
4.
To resize the spreadsheet inside Word so that
you can work in it, click and drag the sizing
handles, just like you would a picture.
In Figure 60-6, I tell Word to show six columns
and seven rows by simply dragging the resizing
handle on the lower-right corner.
• Figure 60-6: Use the resizing handles to make the
embedded spreadsheet bigger.
5.
At this point, you can work inside the spread-
sheet as if you were working in Excel itself —
albeit in a cramped tiny sliver.
In Figure 60-6, I copied data across from my
Woodys Fruit Company sample spreadsheet,
using the same Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V method that I
would use to copy data between any Excel
spreadsheets.
Oddly, the status bar from Excel doesn’t appear
when an embedded spreadsheet is active. If you
want to use Excel’s fast calculation capability
(where you select a bunch of numbers and their
sum appears at the bottom on the status bar),
you’re outta luck.
When you work inside the embedded spread-
sheet, Excel icons go on all the toolbars.

Technique 60: Inserting a Spreadsheet in a Document
408
• Figure 60-8: Drag the picture resizing handles to 
make the image larger or smaller without
affecting the number of cells appearing
inside Word.

Resize the contents of the spreadsheet inside
Excel. Double-click the spreadsheet to give con-
trol to Excel; then select and format any cells
that you wish. In Figure 60-9, I made the contents
of the cells larger, but because I didn’t change
the size of the cells (and they don’t resize auto-
matically), the text gets clipped.
• Figure 60-9: You can resize the fonts from inside Excel,
but then text can get clipped.
6.
To see the spreadsheet inside Word, click any-
where inside the document but outside the
blocked-out Excel area.
In Figure 60-7, I click in the main part of the docu-
ment, and the enlarged 6 x 7 spreadsheet appears.
• Figure 60-7: Click outside the spreadsheet to show the
results.
7.
If you want to work on the spreadsheet again,
double-click inside the spreadsheet area.
Excel comes back up, as in Figure 60-6.
If you want to resize the spreadsheet on the printed
page without changing the number of cells that
appear, you have two choices:

Resize the spreadsheet from Word, as if it were
a picture. Click inside the document (outside 
the spreadsheet) to return control to Word; then
click the spreadsheet once to select it. Use the
resizing handles to make the spreadsheet appear
larger or smaller (see Figure 60-8).
Resizing the spreadsheet as if it were a picture
distorts the characters inside the spreadsheet —
this isn’t the same thing as increasing or
decreasing the font size, and your readers will
notice the difference.

Linking a Spreadsheet
409
If you resize the text as in Figure 60-1 and
then attempt to make the columns wider by
clicking and dragging the column markers
(without expanding the width of the spread-
sheet in Word), Excel makes the columns nar-
rower. There are dozens of hard formatting
bugs like this one in embedded Excel spread-
sheets, and they can drive you up a wall.
Linking a Spreadsheet
In the preceding section, I talk about embedding Excel
spreadsheets in Word documents. Linking is similar
to embedding, but here are the two big differences:

The data remains in a traditional .xls spread-
sheet file. If you move the document to a differ-
ent machine, you have to take the spreadsheet
along with it. At the same time, though, you don’t
get the elephantine embedded spreadsheet bloat.

You can’t edit the data from inside Word. If you
double-click the data, Word starts Excel, and you
work in Excel. Sometimes, changes made in Excel
are immediately reflected in Word; other times,
you have to click the linked spreadsheet image
and press F9 (which updates the link).
Linking to a spreadsheet makes sense when

You need to get the data updated automatically.
In other words, you don’t want to spend the time
to manually copy the data when it changes, and
paste it as a picture in the Word document.

The file size bloat associated with embedding an
entire spreadsheet inside a Word document is
just too much to take.

The document doesn’t need to travel — or if it
does, you’re willing to go to the trouble to make
sure the spreadsheet travels along with it (and
that the destination computer has Excel up and
running).
To link a spreadsheet to a Word document
1.
Open the Word document that will hold the
data.
2.
Open the Excel spreadsheet that has the data.
3.
Select the data that you want to copy and press
Ctrl+C (or choose Edit➪Copy).
Refer to Figure 60-1.
4.
Click inside the Word document where you
want the table made with the Excel data to go.
5.
Choose Edit➪Paste Special.
Word brings up the Paste Special dialog box
(refer to Figure 60-3).
6.
In the As list, choose Microsoft Office Excel
Worksheet Object. Select the Paste Link radio
button. Then click OK.
Word pastes a link in your document. You also
get a highly accurate picture of the spreadsheet,
just like the one in Figure 60-4.
When you want to modify the data, either start Excel
and open the spreadsheet that supplied the data, or
double-click the picture of the spreadsheet inside
the document (in which case, Word starts Excel 
and opens the spreadsheet that supplied the data).
When you’re done making changes to the data, exit
Excel.
To update the picture in the Word document, click it
and press F9. Word automatically updates the picture
whenever it updates fields — typically when you open
the file and just before you print it.
You can click and drag the picture, resize it,
put it in the drawing layer, rotate it — do any-
thing that Word will let you do with a picture.

Technique 60: Inserting a Spreadsheet in a Document
410
• Figure 60-10: Work with the links in your document
individually.
You cannot tell just by looking at the picture in
the document whether you have a link. The
easiest way to work with all the links in a doc-
ument is to choose Edit➪Links. That brings up
the Links dialog box (see Figure 60-10), which
lets you manipulate each link individually.

Managing an
Electronic
Newsletter
W
ith the rise of spam as the world’s number-one electronic threat,
the bloom is off the newsletter rose. Still, if you have compelling
information that people want to read, starting your own elec-
tronic newsletter rates as a first-class way to keep people informed.
I know. In October 1996, I launched the Woody’s Office Watch newsletter
primarily (if you’ll pardon the plug) as a timesaving technique. Peter
Deegan, a long-time friend and correspondent, suggested that instead of
answering Office users’ questions one-by-one, as I had for years, starting
a newsletter and sending the answers out to a lot of people, all at once,
would be whole lot more efficient.
Back in 1996, a lot meant maybe a hundred Office users. I couldn’t even
conceive of a thousand people being interested in Office tips and news.
Man, was I in for a rude awakening. Within five years, WOW and its sister
newsletters grew to more than 500,000 subscribers and heaven only
knows how many readers.
You can change the world with your newsletters. You can keep cus-
tomers informed, troll for new business, preach to the converted, or
hound any hallowed hall you choose. But running a newsletter takes
bunches of time — and a bit of money. That’s where this Technique
comes in.
Choosing to Start a Newsletter
If you’re looking for new customers, trying to motivate a sales force, or
reaching out to the public at large, your newsletter will live and die by
content, content, content.
If you want to keep a newsletter vibrant and alive, you have to include
material that subscribers (even that captive audience — especially that
captive audience!) will devour, talk about, and pass along to others. The
best way to do that is to think like a subscriber. Because you probably

Technique 61: Managing an Electronic Newsletter
412
Starting Small with Outlook
If you have a stable audience — say, fewer than a
couple hundred customers, or employees, or a simi-
lar group that doesn’t change all that much — it’s
easy and fast to maintain your e-mail newsletter 
subscriber list in Outlook.
When the time comes to send out a newsletter, you
write the newsletter in Word and then use Outlook
to send copies to all subscribers. There are several
tricks.
Before you put any work into building your
Outlook Contacts list, send a message to your
Internet service provider (ISP). Some ISPs are
so paranoid about junk mail that they limit
outbound e-mail messages to 25 or even
fewer addressees per message. If you want to
set up an Outlook-based newsletter for 100
subscribers, you better make sure that your
ISP will allow you to send out one message
with 100 addresses in the Bcc (blind carbon
copy) field. Otherwise, you’ll spend far too
much time futzing around with multiple out-
bound messages for a single issue of the
newsletter. If your ISP won’t let you send one
message to all the people on your subscriber
list, get a better ISP.
Creating and maintaining a subscriber list
Here’s how to set up the subscribers in Outlook
Contacts:
1.
Make sure that you have accurate subscriber
information — most importantly, the correct
e-mail address — in your Outlook Contacts list.
In many cases, most (if not all!) of your new 
subscribers will be in the Outlook Contacts list
anyway.
2.
Add a new category for newsletter subscribers
to Outlook. Choose Edit➪Categories. In the
Categories dialog box, click Master Category
List.
already subscribe to a few (dozen? hundred?) 
electronic newsletters, you know what keeps 
subscribers reading:

More information that makes a difference

Better writing that draws people in

Less overhead — advertising, notices, corporate
Pablum, and the like — that turns off people.
The problem with creating successful newsletters —
even newsletters that exist primarily to advertise —
stems from the fact that it isn’t sufficient to write a
compelling story every now and then. You have to
produce great material day after day, week after
week. If you don’t, people stop reading, unsubscribe,
or otherwise ignore your work, and all that hard
effort goes to naught.
Don’t leap into launching a newsletter until you’re
ready to keep it stoked. In particular, as alternatives
to starting a newsletter, consider

Becoming more active on an existing Internet
newsgroup or discussion board. Lending an
experienced hand to those seeking help won’t
make you rich, but it can get you noticed.

Creating your own discussion group.

Running a moderated mailing list.
Unmoderated groups tend to degenerate
into drivel rather quickly. On the other hand,
moderated groups can be very useful for
keeping customers posted on the latest
product developments.
The advantage to all three of these approaches is
that you won’t be responsible for writing all the 
sizzling material that will draw and keep new sub-
scribers — or motivate and energize your captive
audience. Other folks can pitch in. If you do decide
that starting a newsletter is the way to go, the fol-
lowing sections can get you started.

Starting Small with Outlook
413
Outlook shows you the Master Category List dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 61-1.
• Figure 61-1: Create a new category for newsletter
subscribers.
3.
Type a name for your newsletter subscriber 
category and then click Add.
In Figure 61-1, I type Newsletter and then click
Add. That adds a new category — Newsletter —
to Outlook’s master list.
4.
Click OK twice.
5.
One by one, go through each of your news-
letter subscribers in Outlook. Right-click each
entry in the Contacts list and choose
Categories.
Outlook brings up the Categories dialog box (see
Figure 61-2).
6.
Mark the check box for the Newsletter category
and then click OK.
The Contact gets assigned to the Newsletter 
category.
• Figure 61-2: Assign each Contact who’s a subscriber to
the Newsletter category.
Also assign yourself to the Newsletter cate-
gory. That way, you receive a copy of each
newsletter when it goes out, thus confirming
that the mail got through.
7.
When you’re through assigning the Contacts 
to the Newsletter category, double-check your
work by clicking By Category on the left pane
under Current View, or by choosing View➪
Arrange By➪Current View➪By Category.
Outlook shows you a compact list of everyone
who’s assigned to your Newsletter category.
Managing your newsletter mailing list becomes a
matter of keeping Contacts updated:

To add a person to your newsletter mailing list,
add him to your Contacts and then right-click
that entry and assign it to the Newsletter cate-
gory (Steps 5 and 6 in the preceding procedure).

To drop a person from the mailing list, either
delete the person from your Category list or 
(if you want to keep a record of that person)
remove the Newsletter category from that entry
by right-clicking the entry and clearing the
Newsletter Subscriber category.

• Figure 61-3: All the recipients’ e-mail addresses go in the
Bcc field.
5.
In the Contacts list on the right, click the
Categories entry for your newsletter
subscribers.
You don’t need to select all your subscribers.
Simply clicking the Categories heading suffices
(see Figure 61-4).
• Figure 61-4: Bring up your newsletter subscriber list.
6.
Choose Actions➪New Message to Contact.
If Outlook responds by telling you that the action
will apply to all items in the selected groups,
click OK. If Outlook tells you that some of these
Contacts do not have e-mail addresses, your sub-
scriber list is out of whack. You can proceed by
clicking OK, but then you need to go back and
type in valid e-mail addresses for the missing
subscribers before sending out the newsletter.
Creating and sending the newsletter
If your subscriber list is up-to-date and you know
that your ISP will allow you to send a message to
many Bcc addresses, creating and sending the
newsletter couldn’t be simpler — if you know the
tricks:
1.
Write the newsletter in Word.
Some people will tell you that Word creates
absolutely lousy formatted e-mail. They’re right.
Anybody who speaks HTML as a foreign language
and looks at the code underlying your newsletters
will have a well-deserved cow. But unless you’re
sending out tens of thousands of newsletters, or
your subscribers insist on using really buggy
e-mail readers (I’ve had no end of problems with
Pegasus), Word is fast, easy, flexible, reliable —
and it’s the devil ye know.
2.
Choose File➪Send To➪Mail Recipient.
Word sprouts a To and a Cc (carbon copy) box at
the top of the newsletter.
3.
Click the down arrow next to Options and then
choose Bcc.
That puts the Bcc field on the screen underneath
the Cc field (see Figure 61-3).
Because subscribers don’t want their e-mail
addresses broadcast with your newsletter, it’s
vitally important that you stick all your sub-
scriber’s e-mail addresses in the Bcc box and
not the Cc box. When you do so, nobody
(except your ISP) will ever know that the mes-
sage went out to those destination addresses.
4.
Move over to Outlook and bring up your
Contacts list. Get a list of newsletter subscribers
by clicking the By Category button on the left
pane under Current View (or choose View➪
Arrange By➪Current View➪By Category) 
and then scrolling down to your newsletter
subscribers.
Your screen should look like the upcoming 
Figure 61-4.

Using a Newsletter Service
415
Outlook creates a new e-mail message, called
Untitled Message, with all — all — the newsletter
subscribers’ e-mail addresses in the To box (see
Figure 61-5).
• Figure 61-5: A list of e-mail addresses for all of your
newsletter subscribers.
7.
Click once inside the To box of Untitled Message.
Press Ctrl+A to select all the addresses and
then press Ctrl+C to copy all the addresses to
the Clipboard.
8.
Move back to Word and the newsletter. Click
once inside the Bcc box. Then press Ctrl+V to
paste all the addresses into the Bcc box.
Your newsletter message looks like Figure 61-6.
• Figure 61-6: All your subscribers appear in the Bcc box.
9.
Type your own e-mail address in the To box.
Many e-mail systems go bonkers if both the
To and Cc boxes are blank.
10.
Click the Send a Copy button.
The newsletter gets deposited in your Outlook
Outbox. The next time you send messages, the
newsletter wings its way to all your subscribers —
and you, too.
In my experience, after your newsletter subscriber
base grows to more than a couple hundred of
addresses, the Outlook-based approach gets
unwieldy. Word and Outlook can handle the load —
indeed, you can easily send out messages to thou-
sands of people — but the process of updating the
subscriber list takes a lot of time, particularly with
subscribers sending you notifications of address
changes. It might be time to employ a service.
Using a Newsletter Service
The preceding section gives you a detailed, step-
by-step procedure for using Outlook to send news-
letters. I highly recommend using that approach
(providing that your ISP will let you send enough
copies at a time) until you just can’t stand the over-
head of maintaining the subscriber list in your
Outlook Contacts.
If your list has grown too big, your ISP threatens to
shut you down, and/or you have a religious objection
to using Word and Outlook for your newsletter, you
should consider using the services of a newsletter
publisher to provide the infrastructure that you need.
Newsletter services fall into two categories:

Free services: These typically append advertis-
ing to your newsletters. Rarely, you might be able
to find a free service without advertising that
really wants a newsletter covering your topic. See
FreeLists (www.freelists.org) for an example.

Technique 61: Managing an Electronic Newsletter
416
Shop around! Prices for newsletter services
vary all over the map, and discounts can fre-
quently be had for the asking. See Table 61-1
for some eye-opening figures.
• Figure 61-7: Topica’s Email Publisher draws good reviews.
Getting an ISSN
If your newsletter goes out beyond a small circle of 
friends, you should consider applying for an International
Standard Serial Number (ISSN). The eight-digit ISSN num-
ber uniquely identifies a periodical, much as an ISBN 
number uniquely identifies books and other non-periodical
publications.
Applying for an ISSN is easy, fast, and free. Drop by www.
issn.org for instructions and an application form.
The free service that I know best is Topica
(www.topica.com). Log on and sign up to
become a Topica Exchange member. Topica
will try to sell you its Email Publisher service,
but if you’re persistent and wade through the
Web site, you will find free advertising-laden
newsletter services on offer.
I know of very few people who stick with free
newsletter services very long simply because
the advertising can be so intrusive and so
unpredictable.

Paid services: These can be surprisingly cheap —
as little as $25 per month, in some cases. Expect
to get subscription services that include confir-
mation e-mails (so someone subscribing to your
newsletter has to click a link in a message to con-
firm their subscription), templates, fully formatted
(HTML) newsletters, bounce-back management
(where messages that “bounce” with bad
addresses are automatically removed from the
list), and some archiving capabilities. Don’t expect
to get extensive support or any customization.
Topica offers a highly regarded, bare-bones
paid service (www.email-publisher.com, 
see Figure 61-7) that can handle large 
numbers of subscribers. Constant Contact
(www.constantcontact.com) targets people
and companies interested in e-mail marketing.
ennectMail (www.ennectmail.com), which
also offers extensive newsletter support, has
an interesting comparison of the cost of elec-
tronic versus printed newsletters.

Growing Larger Gracefully
If your newsletter needs increase, you will no doubt
find yourself moving from an Outlook-based approach
to a paid newsletter service, and possibly moving
from there to a major newsletter server. The reason?
Money. See Table 61-1.
One company dominates the large-scale newsletter
support software business: Lyris (www.lyris.com).
More than a hundred companies offer Lyris-based
newsletter services.
Lyris itself offers its own newsletter service, starting
at $200 per month, ascending (steeply!) depending
on how many newsletters you send and how many
bytes they consume (see Figure 61-8).
We at Woody’s Watch have been using
Dundee’s Lyris service, www.dundee.net, 
for many years, and it’s worked well for us.
Dundee was the first company to license Lyris
List Manager, so they’ve been at this game for
quite some time.

Technique
Turning a Word
Document Into a
Presentation
S
o you have your report ready, and now you have to give a presenta-
tion on it. Fair enough. Happens every day.
Most people would crank up PowerPoint, type a title slide, bring up the
report, and start copying across the points. You know the drill — select
and copy in Word, paste and pray in PowerPoint. It’s a tedious, error-
prone process almost certainly guaranteed to result in a presentation
that misses some high points and over-emphasizes others. There’s a
much better way.
Few people realize that a well-formatted Word document (which is to say,
one with Heading 1, 2, and 3 styles — the kind folks usually use to create
a Table of Contents, or TOC) can be transformed quickly and easily into a
PowerPoint presentation. Even fewer realize that you can conversely take
a presentation and turn it into a Word outline or TOC, even though
PowerPoint unfortunately applies some truly bizarre formatting to the
heading paragraphs.
This Technique shows you the tricks and the fixes.
Understanding Outline Levels
If you need to turn a Word document into a PowerPoint presentation, and
your document uses the standard Heading 1, 2, and 3 styles, you’re in
luck. Converting the headings in the document into a presentation takes
only a click.
If you have a document that you want to turn into a PowerPoint 
presentation and it uses styles other than Heading 1, 2, 3 and so on,
it’s worth your while to change it over to the Heading styles.
The conversion process relies on a Word paragraph setting called the
Outline Level. Each paragraph in a document has an Outline Level, which
you can set from the Paragraph dialog box (choose Format➪Paragraph;
see Figure 62-1).

Outline; see Figure 62-2):

The highest-level headings are assigned Outline
Level 1.

The next-lower level of headings are Outline
Level 2, and so on.

Run-of-the-mill text gets the lowest Outline level
(Body text).
In Word’s Outline view, changing the Outline Level of
a paragraph is easy. For example, you can click and
drag a paragraph to a higher level, select and push
the Tab key to lower a level, or click inside a para-
graph and assign the level from the drop-down box
on the Outlining toolbar.
• Figure 62-2: Outline view relies on Outline Levels for
organizing paragraphs.
When you apply the Heading 1 style to a 
paragraph, Word assigns it an Outline Level of
1. Heading 2 corresponds to Outline Level 2,
and Heading 3 corresponds to Outline Level 3.
(Ah, New Math.) That’s why it’s fast and easy
to change a document with Heading 1, 2, and
3 styles into a presentation.
When Word creates a Table of Contents, it usually
builds the TOC based on both Heading styles and
Outline Levels. So unless you’ve gone to great pains
to create a custom Table of Contents, the TOC in
your document should reflect the Outline Levels as
well (see Figure 62-3).
Word’s Document Map (choose View➪
Document Map), which appears in a pane 
on the left side of a document, also reflects 
the Outline Levels in the paragraphs.

Technique 62: Turning a Word Document Into a Presentation
420
Converting a TOC to
a Presentation 
Here’s how to convert a well-formed document’s
TOC (or, more accurately, Outline Levels 1–9 para-
graphs) into a PowerPoint presentation:
1.
Open the document in Word.
Create a Table of Contents (choose Insert➪
Reference➪Index and Tables➪Table of Contents
and then click OK) to make sure that your out-
line levels are accurate. Alternatively, you can 
go into Outline view (choose View➪Outline) or
bring up the Document Map (choose View➪
Document Map).
2.
Choose File➪Send To➪Microsoft Office
PowerPoint.
PowerPoint appears with a completely bare pres-
entation (see Figure 62-4).
• Figure 62-4: You get a minimalist presentation, with no
title slide and no design applied.
3.
Verify that you have one slide in PowerPoint
for each Outline Level 1 paragraph in Word.
If you encounter extra slides, click them one-by-
one and press Delete to delete them. If you have
one slide where you should have two, click the
• Figure 62-3: The Table of Contents also reflects 
Outline Levels.
When Word converts a document to a PowerPoint
presentation, it relies on Outline Levels. The con-
verter starts at the beginning of the document; then

The converter ignores all paragraphs at the 
lowest Outline Level (body text).

When the converter encounters an Outline Level
1 paragraph, it creates a new slide and uses the
contents of the paragraph as the slide’s title.

When it encounters an Outline Level 2 paragraph,
it creates a high-level bullet point on the current
slide and uses the contents of the paragraph for
the text on the bullet point.

When it encounters an Outline Level 3–9 para-
graph, it creates a lower-level bullet point, using
the contents of the paragraph for the bullet text.
In effect, if you have a document with Heading 1, 2,
and 3 styles — and you haven’t applied any Outline
Levels manually — the Table of Contents of the docu-
ment turns into the PowerPoint presentation, with
each high-level heading in the TOC turning into a
new slide.

bullet point that should start a new slide and
then click the Decrease Indent icon on the
Formatting toolbar (the one with a bunch of lines
and a left-pointing arrow) until PowerPoint cre-
ates a new slide.
I’ve seen bugs in all versions of Office, but
most distressingly in Office 2003, PowerPoint
generates additional slides when there should
be none and occasionally creates one slide
where there should be more than one. Yes,
Microsoft ran out of money when it built
Office 2003. That’s the only possible explana-
tion for such sloppiness, eh?
4.
Add a title slide by clicking the New Slide 
button on the Formatting toolbar, clicking the
first sample in the Text Layouts pane on the
right (it’s called Title Slide), and then clicking
and dragging the new title slide to the begin-
ning of the presentation. Type the title of the
presentation on the title slide.
The new title slide appears at the top of the heap
(see Figure 62-5).
• Figure 62-5: Create and then drag a new title slide to the
beginning of the presentation.
5.
Apply a design by clicking the Design button
on the Formatting toolbar and then choosing 
a design from the task pane.
In Figure 62-6, I apply the Mountain Top design.
• Figure 62-6: Manually apply a design.
6.
Edit and save your new presentation.
Converting a Presentation 
to a TOC
In the preceding section, I show you how to convert
a Word document — basically, its Table of Contents —
into a PowerPoint presentation.
Going the other way, PowerPoint makes it very easy
to convert a presentation into the skeleton of a Word
document — albeit a very bizarrely formatted docu-
ment. In Word 2003, the resulting document is down-
right garish.
Here’s how to convert a PowerPoint presentation
into the heading points (or outline, or Table of
Contents — they’re basically all the same thing) of 
a Word document and then convert the document
into something legible:
1.
Open the PowerPoint presentation.
In Figure 62-7, I open the Connecting in Phuket
presentation that appears in Technique 50.
2.
Choose File➪Send To➪Microsoft Office Word.
PowerPoint responds with the Send to Microsoft
Office Word dialog box, as shown in Figure 62-8.

Technique 62: Turning a Word Document Into a Presentation
422
 Slide headings turn into Heading 1 para-
graphs, but PowerPoint overrides your
default Heading 1 formatting, setting its own
style with a headache-inducing Tahoma 22
point shadow text.
 Main slide bullet points turn into Heading 2
paragraphs, but again PowerPoint overrides
your Heading 2 format, setting it at Arial 14
point bold (which isn’t too bad).
 Subordinate slide bullet points turn into
Heading 3 paragraphs, with the style over-
ridden in First Grade Crayola . . . uh, 
Tahoma 14 point shadow.
• Figure 62-9: Quite possibly the worst automatically applied
formatting I’ve ever seen — and PowerPoint
does it whether you want it or not.
4.
Use this very convoluted way to apply your
default Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3
formatting to this bizarre document. Start by
creating a new blank document by clicking the
New icon on the far left of the Standard toolbar.
Word brings up a new, clean document.
5.
Press Enter a few times; then go back to the top
of the document and turn the first paragraph
into a Heading 1 paragraph by clicking the
drop-down arrow next to the Style box (the one
that reads Normal) and choosing Heading 1.
Go to the second paragraph and make it
Heading 2. Make the third paragraph Heading
3, and the next one Heading 4.
• Figure 62-7: Start with the presentation.
• Figure 62-8: Send the outline to Word.
3.
Select the Outline Only radio button; then 
click OK.
Word comes up with a new document that
includes a nearly illegible copy of the text on 
the slides (see Figure 62-9).

6.
Choose File➪Save As. In the Save As Type box,
choose Document Template. Type a name for
the template and then click Save.
In Figure 62-10, I saved the template as Sane.dot,
which is meant to be in stark contrast to the for-
matting applied automatically by PowerPoint.
• Figure 62-10: Save a template with all your major
Heading styles.
7.
Go back to the PowerPoint-generated document.
Choose Tools➪Templates and Add-Ins, and then
click the Organizer button in the lower-left corner.
Word responds with the Organizer dialog box
(see Figure 62-11).
• Figure 62-11: The template Organizer allows you to copy
styles from a template to a document.
8.
On the right, under where it reads Styles
Available In /Normal.dot, click Close File.
The Closed File button immediately changes into
an Open File button.
9.
Click Open File.
Word responds with a standard Open dialog box,
which is looking at your Templates folder.
10.
Choose the template that you saved in Step 6.
Click Open.
As you might expect, I choose Sane.dot.
11.
Select all the Heading styles on the right
(Sane.dot) side of the Organizer dialog box;
then click Copy.
12.
Word asks whether you want to overwrite 
the bizarre heading styles in the PowerPoint-
generated document. Click Yes to All.
Although there is no response from Word, the
styles in the PowerPoint-generated document 
are overwritten nonetheless.
13.
Click Close.
Word returns to the document, which now has
reasonable heading formatting, but the headings
still have manually applied bullets.
14.
Select everything in the document by pressing
Ctrl+A. Then choose Format➪Bullets and
Numbering➪Bulleted, click the None sample,
and click OK.
Word finally — finally! — has a decently format-
ted document, ready for you to flesh out (see
Figure 62-12).

Technique
Animating a Chart
in PowerPoint
N
o doubt you’ve seen a PowerPoint presentation that includes a
chart that goes zip-zip-zip, with lines or bars or pie slices appear-
ing onscreen one piece at a time while the speaker tells a tale that
explains the data as it unfolds. Done well, animated charts can paint a
very compelling picture — one that’s worth a thousand words (or per-
haps two thousand bullet points).
Although you might think that it takes some sort of rocket scientist to
stick a whizzing animated chart into a PowerPoint slide, you’d be wrong.
In fact, far too few rocket scientists put animated charts in their presen-
tations. Just about anybody with a good story to tell, an Excel spread-
sheet to back it up, and a touch of pizazz can put together an absolutely
killer animated slide in about 15 minutes.
Or you can lose hours trying to get past PowerPoint’s bugs.
This Technique leads the way.
Building Charts in Excel
Excel charts in PowerPoint presentations can really make a point.
Numbers talk. Bull . . . ets walk.
If you have the kind of data that lends itself to animation — bringing in
one bunch of data, followed by another, then another — and you can use
the step-by-step introduction of data on the slide to get across a com-
pelling story. You have the makings of a presentation that people will talk
about for days.
It all starts with the data.
Here’s how to build a PowerPoint-ready graph (or chart if you want to use
the official Microsoft terminology) in Excel:

Building Charts in Excel
425
1.
Start with a spreadsheet that shows the data
you want to get across. If you want to change
column headings so they show up differently
on the chart’s legend, now’s the time to do it.
In Figure 63-1, I open the Woodys Fruit Company
Sales spreadsheet.
• Figure 63-1: Create or open a spreadsheet with
compelling data.
2.
Select the data and then click the Chart Wizard
icon on the Standard toolbar. (The Chart
Wizard icon looks like a column graph.)
Excel responds with Step 1 of the Chart Wizard
(see Figure 63-2).
When selecting data to form a column, bar,
area, or line chart, selecting subtotals or totals
is unusual. Generally, you want to select the
data and the row and column headings. Pie
charts, however, usually work with totals.
Hold down the Ctrl key while you click to
select cells that aren’t next to each other.
3.
On the Standard Types tab, pick a chart type
and subtype, clicking the Press and Hold to
View Sample button to see a preview of how
your presentation’s chart will look. When you
have the right kind of chart, click Next.
• Figure 63-2: Choose a chart (chart) type here.
4.
In Step 2 of the Chart Wizard, verify that Excel
chose the right data and then click Next.
You see Step 3 of the wizard.
5.
Avoid the temptation to type in a chart title;
just click Next.
Excel brings you to the final step of the wizard
(see Figure 63-3).
• Figure 63-3: Always put the chart in a new sheet.

Technique 63: Animating a Chart in PowerPoint
426
1.
Open or create the PowerPoint presentation.
If you have an existing presentation, click the
slide that comes before the one that you want to
hold the animated chart.
2.
Click the New Slide button on the Formatting
toolbar.
PowerPoint creates a new slide and brings up the
Slide Layout task pane (see the right side of
Figure 63-5).
• Figure 63-5: Create a new slide with blank content
layout.
3.
Click under Content Layouts to apply the blank
layout to the slide.
Because most animated charts are so big that
they take up the entire slide (and then some!), I
almost always choose the first Content Layout,
the one called Blank (refer to Figure 63-5).
4.
Go back to your chart in Excel. Hover your
mouse above the chart’s legend, on the right,
until the ToolTip reads Chart Area. Click once
in the Chart Area and choose Edit➪Copy.
That copies the entire chart to the Clipboard
(see Figure 63-6).
6.
Select the As New Sheet radio button and then
click Finish.
Excel creates a new chart and puts it on its own
sheet (see Figure 63-4). For now, there’s no reason
to format the chart — you can do that when you
put it in the presentation itself (see the next 
section).
7.
Save the file.
• Figure 63-4: The chart is ready to place on a PowerPoint
slide.
Putting a Chart on a Slide
In the preceding section, I show you how to create 
a chart in Excel that’s ripe for plucking and sticking
into a PowerPoint presentation. That part’s pretty
straightforward. Unfortunately, the PowerPoint part
in this section is riddled with bugs and gotchas.
Follow along closely.
To put the Excel chart on a PowerPoint slide in a
way that lets you modify the chart quickly and ani-
mate the chart’s appearance, do the following:

Putting a Chart on a Slide
427
• Figure 63-6: Copy the Chart Area to the Clipboard.
5.
Move back to PowerPoint. Choose Edit➪Paste.
PowerPoint pastes a very squished, completely
illegible copy of the chart onto the slide (see
Figure 63-7).
• Figure 63-7: Paste the chart onto the slide.
Resist the immediate temptation to drag the
resizing handles and make the chart bigger. If
you do, the text will probably become com-
pletely illegible.
6.
Double-click the squished chart.
That brings up Excel, with the still-squished
chart showing (see Figure 63-8).
• Figure 63-8: Double-click the squished chart to bring up
Excel inside PowerPoint.
7.
Click and drag the resizing handles in the 
corners to maximize the chart on the slide.
You can even let the Excel sheet navigation 
area — where it reads Chart1 and Sheet1 — flop
off the bottom of the slide (see Figure 63-9).
8.
Click once on the slide, outside the chart area.
You see the slide in all its glory, ready to be 
animated (see Figure 63-10). I explain how 
to animate the chart in the next section.
When you leave Excel and go back into
PowerPoint, the Excel navigation buttons 
disappear.

Technique 63: Animating a Chart in PowerPoint
428
Animating the Chart
In the first section of this Technique, I show you how
to create a chart in Excel that’s suitable for animat-
ing. In the second section, I explain how to put that
chart on a slide. In this section, I (finally!) show you
how to automate pieces of the chart that so they
appear, with each piece arriving at the command of
your click.
Here’s how to animate the chart:
1.
Open the presentation, go to the slide that con-
tains the chart you want to animate, and click
the chart.
The chart should have selection dots around it
(refer to Figure 63-10).
2.
Choose Slide Show➪Custom Animation.
The Custom Animation task pane appears (see
the right side of Figure 63-11).
• Figure 63-11: Set chart animation with the Custom
Animation task pane.
• Figure 63-9: Resize inside Excel to get a high-quality
chart on a slide.
• Figure 63-10: Time to animate the chart.
If you want to change anything about the chart —
fonts, colors, data order, the legend, whatever —
double-click the chart and use Excel’s wide array of
formatting options. In Figure 63-10, I went back into
Excel by double-clicking the chart, right-clicking
each of the axes in turn, choosing Format Axis, and
then turning the fonts white so they would be legible
on the slide.

Animating the Chart
429
3.
You must select one animation to be used for
all the pieces of the chart. (For example, you
can’t use Wipe for some parts of the chart and
Checkerboard for others.) To pick the global
animation, choose Add Effect➪Entrance and
pick an entrance animation.
You can choose an animation from the list offered
(which looks something like Figure 63-12) or
choose More Effects to see many dozens more.
• Figure 63-12: You must choose a custom animation for
the chart as a whole.
Microsoft doesn’t document it anywhere — 
in fact, I don’t think this has ever been docu-
mented before — but if you want to animate
pieces of the chart, you cannot pick any of the
animations in Table 63-1. If you do, PowerPoint
accepts what you’ve chosen, but doesn’t let
you animate the chart (see Step 5). As far as I
can tell, this is a bug. It’s certainly infuriating —
and the source of many wasted hours.
PowerPoint shows your custom animation in the
task pane. In Figure 63-13, I chose the Appear
animation.

(or press F5) to run the slideshow. Watch how
the elements of the chart appear as you click
the mouse.
As soon as you run through the animation, the
Add Effect button (in Figure 63-15) becomes the
Change button.
8.
If you feel so inclined, click the Change button
on the Custom Animation task pane and return
to Step 3. You can also double-click the chart to
go back to Excel and change any details about
the chart itself.
9.
Save the animated presentation.
Congratulations!

If As One Object is your lone option, you chose
one of the buggy entrance animations in Table

Custom Animation task pane) and then click
Remove to get rid of the buggy animation. Then
go back to Step 3, repeat Step 4, and pick a
good animation.
Yep. You guessed it. Microsoft ran out of money
when it was debugging PowerPoint.
6.
In the Appear dialog box, choose one of the
four Group Chart options as explained in 
Table 63-2. Click OK.
In Figure 63-14, I choose By Series. Excel returns
to the chart, with all the animation points ready
(see Figure 63-15). Different animation points are
set for the chart’s grid lines than for each of the
sets of stacked bars. That means that you have
to click for the grid lines to appear, click again to
bring in the first set of stacked bars, click again
for the second set, and so on. The animation
visual effect (fly, bounce, float, whatever) is the
same for each of the components.

Running Fine-Grain Animation
431
Running Fine-Grain Animation
The preceding sections show you how to animate
the major components of a chart.
PowerPoint actually has the ability to animate every
single detail in a chart — every bar, point, line, label,
legend . . . any detail that you can see on the slide
can be brought in with its own animation, under your
control. The procedure involves a lot of nit-picking
detail, but if you’re persistent, anything’s possible.
Here’s how:
1.
Follow the steps in the first two sections of this
Technique to put a chart on a PowerPoint slide.
2.
Right-click the chart and choose Grouping➪
Ungroup.
PowerPoint shows you the warning in Figure 63-16.
• Figure 63-16: Convert the chart to a drawing object only
if you have the original data safely tucked
away.
3.
Click Yes.
A bug in PowerPoint (tell me if you’ve heard this
one before) prevents it from ungrouping the
chart. So you have to do all this a second time.
4.
Right-click the chart again and choose
Grouping➪Ungroup again.
This time the chart explodes. Or implodes.
PowerPoint breaks the chart down into its 
zillions of components (see Figure 63-17).
5.
Click once outside the chart to deselect all the
pieces. Then choose Slide Show➪Custom
Animation to bring up the Custom Animation
task pane.
6.
Select individual elements that you want to ani-
mate (hold down Ctrl while you click them) 
and then click the Add Effect button to set the
animation that you want.
The pieces of the chart are numbered in a more-
or-less logical way, which you might helpful
when chasing down recalcitrant pieces (see
Figure 63-18).
From that point, you can save, modify and run the
presentation to your heart’s content.

When you first click, shows all the bottom bars. When you click a second time, shows all the

When you first click, shows all the bars, stacked on top of each other, for the first item on the
x axis. When you click again, shows all the bars, stacked, for the second item. And so on.

On the first click, shows the bottom bar for the first item on the x axis. On the next click,
shows the bottom bar for the second item on the x axis. On the next click, shows the bottom
bar for the third item. When you reach the end of the x axis, shows the second bar for the first
item, stacked on top of the bottom bar. And so on.

On the first click, shows the bottom bar for the first item on the x axis. On the second click,
shows the second bar stacked on top of the bottom bar for the first item. Then shows the

second item on the x axis.

Rotating Text in a
Word Document
F
or more than a decade now, I’ve been amazed at how hard it can be
to do really simple, everyday stuff in Office.
One of my favorite examples is rotating text in a Word document.
Everybody, sooner or later, needs to rotate some text in a doc, whether
it’s to emphasize a word or two, create an ad, or even to print a name tent
that you fold and put on the table in front of participants at a conference.
As long as you need to rotate the text by 90 degrees, Word has some
(clumsy!) tools that will help. But if you need to rotate text by 45 degrees —
or even 180 degrees — your choices are incredibly poor.
Unless you know the trick.
This Technique steps you through the Word-only solutions (which work
in certain limited circumstances) and then shows you how to solve
almost any problem (by using Excel).
Rotating Text with Word Tools
If you need to rotate text in a Word document, your choices don’t look
very good, both literally and figuratively:

Try WordArt. Choose Insert➪Picture➪WordArt. From the WordArt
Gallery, you can choose from a handful of designs. Click a design, 
click OK, type the text that you want to use, click OK again, and the
WordArt appears (see Figure 64-1). To adjust the angle of rotation,
click the WordArt, choose Format➪WordArt➪Size, and change the
Rotation number.

Put text in a table cell. Drawing a table can be a monumental hassle,
particularly if you’re trying to put the rotated text in line with other
text. After you create a table, type the text in a cell, choose Format➪
Text Direction and rotate the text by plus or minus 90 degrees (see
Figure 64-2). Those are your only choices: You can’t even invert the
text.

2.
Select the text you want to rotate and press
Ctrl+X (or choose Edit➪Cut).
That puts the text on the Clipboard.
3.
Choose Edit➪Paste Special, select Picture
(Windows Metafile), and then click OK.
Word inserts a picture of the text into your docu-
ment. Unfortunately, it’s a big picture, which you
need to crop.
4.
Right-click the picture and select Show Picture
Toolbar.
5.
Click the Crop icon on the Picture toolbar (it
looks like two overlapping carpenter squares).
Then click and drag the sizing handles around
the picture, cropping out all the white space
(see Figure 64-3).
• Figure 64-3: Crop off all the excess white space in the
picture.
6.
Click the Text Wrapping icon on the Picture
toolbar (it looks like a dog) and choose Tight.
The picture gets a green rotation handle above
the top of the text (see Figure 64-4).
• Figure 64-4: Rotate the text however you like.
• Figure 64-1: WordArt rotated text tends to be garish and
hard to control.
• Figure 64-2: Table cells let you rotate only by plus or
minus 90 degrees.

Use a text box. Any AutoShape with text inside
(see Technique 11) can have the text rotated, but
just like with table cells, your only options are
plus or minus 90 degrees.

Take a picture. This is a quick-and-dirty approach
(see the following steps) that might be usable if
you don’t need a particularly good quality rendi-
tion of the text.
Here’s how to take a picture of text in a document
and then rotate the picture:
1.
In Word, open or create a document. In Print
Layout view (choose View➪Print Layout), type
the text you want to rotate in your document.

Making a Name Tent
435
7.
Click the rotation handle and rotate the text.
You can click and drag to move the text, too.
The result isn’t very true to the original font, 
but if you need something really quick, it might
suffice.
Making a Name Tent
If you want a quick name tent — a piece of paper that
you can fold and use to identify people sitting at a
table — Word can do it:
1.
Create a new document. In Print Layout view
(choose View➪Print Layout), make things more
visible by clicking the Zoom setting on the
Standard toolbar and choosing Whole Page.
2.
Choose Table➪Insert➪Table. In the Insert
Table dialog box, tell Word that you want 
2 columns and 1 row. Set the Fixed Column
Width to Auto and then click OK.
Word creates a small, two-cell table at the top of
the page.
3.
Click the lower, horizontal line (the bottom line
of the table) and drag it to the bottom of the
page (see Figure 64-5).
4.
Choose Table➪Select➪Table. First choose
Format➪Borders and then choose Shading➪
Borders. Click None and then click OK.
Although you probably still see borders, the bor-
ders on the table are toast.
Technically, the borders are called table grid-

Rotating Any Text
If the two preceding sections left you with the
impression that Word is singularly ill-equipped to
produce text at any angle beyond zero degrees —
simple left-to-right — well, you’re absolutely correct.
In fact, if you don’t know the trick, you can lose an
enormous amount of time trying to rotate text in
Word, coming up only with something that’s just
barely legible. I know. Been there. Done that.
The trick: Use Excel. Unlike Microsoft’s flagship word
processor, its flagship spreadsheet program rotates
text with ease, and the result looks very good indeed.
Here’s how to stick an Excel-rotated word or phrase
into a Word document:
1.
Create or open the Word document where the
rotated text is supposed to go. In Page Layout
view, type any text that goes before or after the
rotated text.

4.
Click in cell A1 and type the text that you want
to appear in your document. Press Enter. Format
it with whatever font you like (choose Format➪
Cells➪Font).
The text appears in the upper-left cell (A1) of the
spreadsheet (see Figure 64-10).
• Figure 64-10: The text destined for Word goes in cell A1.
5.
Right-click cell A1 and choose Format Cells➪
Alignment.
Excel (working inside Word) responds with the
Format Cells dialog box, as shown in Figure 64-11.
6.
Under Orientation, click and drag the Text line
or set a rotation angle in the Degrees box; then
click OK.
Word appears with the text rotated inside the
cell (see Figure 64-12). The text might look blurry
on your screen, but in fact, it’s very high quality
and prints with absolute fidelity.
• Figure 64-11: Rotate the text however you like from the
Excel Format Cells dialog box.
• Figure 64-12: The text is rotated, but it’s still in an Excel

Make cell A1 as small as you can without bump-
ing into the text.
Excel automatically adjusts the width of the A
cell if you move your mouse slowly to the right
of the cell with the A, until it turns into a + sign
with arrows on the right and left. Then 
double-click.

Do the same with the horizontal line below 
the 1.
The trimmed cell looks like Figure 64-13.

sheet. And when the text prints, it’s absolutely
perfect.

The Scary (Or Fun!)
Stuff

Taking Over Word’s
Show/Hide
A
lmost every day, I get a message complaining about Word breaking
out in dots. Dots run all over the page, making it impossible to
stare at the screen for more than ten seconds without getting a
headache (or at least a flashback to high school and a terminal case of
acne).
The dots appear onscreen when you click Word’s Show/Hide icon on 
the Standard toolbar. It’s the one that looks like Word’s paragraph mark,
¶ — better known to the cognoscenti as a pilcrow. When you click the
Show/Hide icon, every space in your document gets a big, fat, space dot
stuck right in the middle. You can conveniently click it again to toggle it
off, but then you lose the good stuff you still want to see, as I explain in
this Technique.
Some people love looking at the dots, particularly if they have to get rid
of extra spaces in a manuscript. But most people hate the dots. I fall into
the latter camp, as do about 99 percent of the people I know.
This Technique shows you how to write a small macro that not only gets rid
of the dots but also actually makes Show/Hide do something quite useful.
Seeing Word’s Critical Marks
In Technique 15, I show why it’s absolutely vital for Word users to show
these three critical formatting characters onscreen:

Paragraph marks: You need to see paragraph marks all the time because
Word stores paragraph formatting in the paragraph mark. If you’ve ever
seen Word suddenly start right-justifying your paragraphs, or making
everything bold or italic or both, or sticking bullets or numbers on all 
the lines, you’ve experienced the effects of formatting that’s stored in the
paragraph mark. If you can’t see the paragraph mark, you don’t stand a
snowball’s chance in Phuket of understanding what’s going on.

Tabs: You must have Word show you Tab characters. If Tab characters
stay invisible, the text that you type or copy can flip-flop all over the

Technique 65: Taking Over Word’s Show/Hide
442
One Space or Two?
When I learned to type — on a manual typewriter, no less —
my teacher taught me to put two spaces after every period.
That’s not surprising. Since typewriters first appeared, two
spaces after the period has been the de facto standard. Even
Mark Twain used two spaces (see www.mytypewriter.com).
Times have changed. The standard for published work is
one space after the period, and most publishers want the
extra spaces expunged (see www.press.uchicago.edu/
Misc/Chicago/cmosfaq/cmosfaq.OneSpaceorTwo.
html). That doesn’t mean you have to use just one space.
But if you want to publish what you write, you’ll save your-
self a lot of time by sticking to a single space.
The next section in this Technique shows you how
to create a macro that takes control of the Show/
Hide icon, making it show you only those formatting
characters you need to see — with nary a dot in sight.
A macro is just a computer program. Nothing
more, nothing less. All Office applications
allow you to write your own programs — your
own macros — which you can run in a myriad
of different ways.
Building a Better Show/Hide
I have one macro that I use on every PC I own. I hook
it up so it runs every time I click the Show/Hide icon
in Word. In the next section, I explain how to write
the macro and make it work in place of Word’s stan-
dard Show/Hide function. In this section, I explain
what the macro does when you click the Show/Hide
icon. (You can also find these settings by choosing
Tools➪Options➪View.)

Show All: Turns off Show All, which has Word
show paragraph marks, Tab characters, picture
anchors, and all those ugly dots in place of
spaces.

Show Spaces: Turns off Show Spaces, which also
makes Word show you all those ugly dots.
screen like an accordion
playing
Flight

the
Bumblebee, and
you’ll never have a clue why the text
(mis)behaves the way it does.

Picture anchors: You should have Word show
you picture anchors. The minute you click and
drag a floating picture, the location of its anchor
controls its destiny. When an anchor moves,
your picture does, too — and if you can’t see 
the anchor, you have absolutely no idea why a
particular picture starts flying across the page.
Straight out of the box, Word includes an easy way
to show you all three of these critical marks. Simply
click the Show/Hide icon on the Standard toolbar —
the one that looks like a backward P (a pilcrow, ¶) —
and Word shows you paragraph marks, Tab charac-
ters, and picture anchors. But it also shows you big
dots, right in the middle of every space in the 
document (see Figure 65-1).
• Figure 65-1: The formatting marks are great, but who
needs all the dots?
The dots can help editors (and you) find extra spaces
buried in documents — most frequently, two spaces
after a period (see the sidebar, “One Space or Two?”).
But for most people, most of the time, the dots are so
bad that one click of the Show/Hide icon is immedi-
ately followed by another click of the Show/Hide icon
(turn it off!), thus obscuring the critically important
paragraph mark, Tab characters, and picture anchors.

Writing the Macro


Field results: Tells Word to start showing field
results if Word currently shows field codes (those
small directives like {date} that go out and
retrieve stuff) for the entire document. This
doesn’t change the setting for individual fields,
though, so if you’re looking at one specific field
code, clicking the Show/Hide icon won’t change
anything.

Hide critical marks: Tells Word to hide para-
graph marks, Tab characters, and picture
anchors if Word currently shows paragraph
marks.

Show critical marks: Tells Word to show 
paragraph marks, Tab characters, and picture
anchors if Word doesn’t currently show para-
graph marks.
Writing the Macro
The preceding sections in this Technique explain
why and how the macro works. This section gets
down to the nitty-gritty.
If you’ve never written a Word macro before, this is
an excellent first effort. Typing the macro commands
takes a little bit of time, but Word helps. Even if you
mess up beyond all hope, removing everything
you’ve done takes only two clicks.
Here’s how to write a macro that takes over the
Show/Hide icon:
1.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros.
Word shows you the Macros dialog box, as
shown in Figure 65-2.
If you have trouble bringing up the Macros
dialog box, or if any of the buttons you need
appear grayed out, someone has possibly
locked you out of your global template, 
normal.dot. Check with your network 
administrator — and complain loudly that
you want to be able to control your own 
Word destiny!
• Figure 65-2: Create a new macro called ShowAll.
2.
Type ShowAll (all one word) in the Macro Name
box and then click the Create button.
Macro names can’t have any spaces or weird
characters. (Numerals are okay.)
ShowAll is the name of the macro that Word
already has assigned to the Show/Hide icon.
By telling Word to create a new macro called
ShowAll, you’re also telling Word that you want
this new macro to run in place of the old one
every time you click the Show/Hide icon.
Word cranks up the Visual Basic Editor (VBE; see
Figure 65-3).
• Figure 65-3: The VBE, where you get to write your own
programs.
3.
Select everything between Sub ShowAll() and
EndSub and then delete it.

Technique 65: Taking Over Word’s Show/Hide
444
Your macro is saved automatically; then both
VBA and Word quit.
From this point on, every time you click the
Show/Hide icon, Word runs your macro, cycling
between showing and not showing the important
formatting marks.
• Figure 65-5: The entire ShowAll program.
If you ever decide to get rid of the macro,
choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros, click ShowAll
once, and then click Delete. That’s all there is
to it. Your macro is gone forever, and Word
reverts to its old, ugly behavior.
Special thanks to Guy Wells for help with the macro.
Start from a clean slate (see Figure 65-4).
• Figure 65-4: Get rid of the old ShowAll macro.
4.
Type the lines of code shown in the upcoming
Listing 65-1.
As you type, you discover that VBA helps do
some of the typing for you. Try using the Tab key
to accept suggestions from VBA as you type.
Ultimately, the program looks like Figure 65-5.
5.
Go back to Word and click the Show/Hide icon.
As you click the button repeatedly, Word cycles
between showing the formatting marks (para-
graph marks, Tab characters, and picture
anchors) and not showing any formatting marks.
Those ugly dots for spaces never appear.
6.
When you’re satisfied that the macro works
properly, from inside Word, choose File➪Exit.

Unformatted 
Text in Word
I
t seems like I spend my life copying and pasting.
I grab text from documents, from Web pages, from spreadsheets, from
old text files, from every imaginable place, and then paste, paste, paste
into Word. It’s like I press Ctrl+C (which copies text to the Clipboard) and
then Ctrl+V (which pastes text from the Clipboard) in my sleep. The Ctrl,
C, and V keycaps on my keyboard are nearly worn out. True fact.
But there’s a teensy-tiny problem with pasting. Usually when I paste
something into a document, I don’t want the formatting from the old loca-
tion to come along for the ride. Tag-along formatting really screws up my
documents — if not now, then a day or a week or a month down the road.
That’s why one of my favorite timesaving techniques of all time involves
a little macro that strips the formatting from text before pasting it into
my document.
Word Pasting 101
If you’re like most folks, when you paste text in a Word document, you
want the pasted text to take on the formatting in the document. Rarely 
do you want to keep the formatting from the text source. You can futz
with the Paste Options Smart Tag and hunt and peck your way around
the problem. Or you can override Office’s built-in settings, solving the
problem once and for all.
Word victims (like me!) commonly paste in one of four ways:

Press Ctrl+V. This method is by far the fastest, easiest way to paste
and the number-one choice of power users.

Click the Paste icon on the Standard toolbar. This method is slow
(gotta use your mouse) and error-prone (it’s hard to hone in on that lit-
tle icon, which looks like a clipboard with a document). However,

your way

Technique 66: Inserting Unformatted Text in Word
446
Yes, there are other ways to paste: click and drag;
right-click and choose Paste; Shift+Insert; choose
Edit➪Paste Special; and click Paste in the Office
Clipboard task pane. But the four pasting methods 
in the preceding bulleted list cover the lion’s share
of pasting, at least in my experience.
Most of the time when you paste, Word displays a
special Paste Options Smart Tag near the bottom-
right corner of what you’ve pasted (see Figure 66-2).
• Figure 66-2: The Paste Options Smart Tag.
Although the Paste Options Smart Tag
appears most of the time, I’ve hit situations
where it adamantly refuses to appear: I can
paste, undo, and paste again — and the Smart
Tag still doesn’t show up. It appears to be an
intermittent bug, which hasn’t been docu-
mented anywhere I know.
If you click that Smart Tag, you can choose to

Keep Source Formatting: That sounds simple,
but it isn’t because the results depend on
whether you selected a paragraph mark when
you copied the text (and the paragraph mark 
can be in a Word document, a formatted e-mail
message, or an HTML/Web page). If you select
the paragraph mark, knowingly or not, all the
paragraph formatting follows in addition to the
paragraph mark and the paragraph’s style. To
add insult to injury, the paragraph’s style is
those who haven’t memorized the Ctrl+V key
combination use it most frequently: It’s the 
number-one choice of new Office users.

Choose Edit➪Paste. Most newbies get over this
bad, slow habit quickly.

Use the Insert key. The least common method 
of the bunch, you can tell Word that you want 
to use the Insert key to paste by choosing
Tools➪Options➪Edit and marking the Use the
INS Key for Paste check box (see Figure 66-1).
Using the Insert key is a disaster waiting to hap-
pen because it sends you into overtype mode
(gobbling up any text you’ve already typed, even
if you press the key accidentally, which is easy
enough to do). If you make the Insert key paste,
you don’t have to worry about being sporadi-
cally thrust into the overtype twilight zone.
• Figure 66-1: Tell Word to use the Insert key for pasting
instead of wigging out to overtype mode.

added to the document’s list of styles. If you didn’t
select the paragraph mark, you get only the char-
acter formatting inherited from the paragraph’s
style. And if you selected a section break acci-
dentally when you copied. . . . Whoa, Nelly.

Match Destination Formatting: Word applies all
of the formatting in effect at the current cursor
location to everything that’s copied. Paragraph
marks take on the paragraph style at the current
cursor location. Text takes on all the formatting
in effect at the cursor location — whether from
paragraph or character styles or from manually
applied formatting — but manually applied for-
matting in the copied text is maintained.

Keep Text Only: If a paragraph mark is at the
end of the copied text, it’s thrown away. The 
text — no pictures, no formatting, no styles —
gets copied across. Paragraph marks are copied,
too: They take on the paragraph style at the 
current cursor location.
Predictably, Keep Source Formatting — the option
that causes the greatest possible havoc, and the one
least likely to produce the desired result — is the
default.
Writing a Pasting Macro
In the preceding section, I explain how Word has an
annoying habit of carrying along all the baggage —
er, all the formatting — when you paste stuff into a
Word document.
I know an easy way to tell Word that you don’t want
to copy anything except the raw, plain, unadorned
text. In fact, all it takes is a two-line macro. Here’s
how to write it:
1.
Start Word.
2.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros.
Word brings up the Macros dialog box (see
Figure 66-3).
• Figure 66-3: Create a new macro called
PasteUnformatted.
If you have trouble bringing up the Macros 
dialog box, or if any of the buttons you need
appear grayed out, someone has possibly locked
you out of your global template, normal.dot.
Check with your network administrator — and
complain loudly that you want to be able to
control your own Word destiny!
3.
In the Macro Name box, type a name for the
macro, such as PasteUnformatted. In the Macros
In box, choose Normal.dot. Then click Create.
Macro names can’t have any spaces or weird
characters. (Numerals are okay.)
Word takes you into the Visual Basic Editor (VBE;
see Figure 66-4). It isn’t nearly as scary as it looks.
• Figure 66-4: Type the macro into the VBE.

Technique 66: Inserting Unformatted Text in Word
448
Assigning a Shortcut to
the Pasting Macro
In the preceding section, I show you how to write a
macro that pastes plain, simple text — no pictures,
no formatting, no styles. Just text.
In this section, you get to grapple with the question
of how you want to run the PasteUnformatted macro.
You have a couple of viable options:

You can hook up this PasteUnformatted macro
to its own toolbar icon or to a special key combi-
nation (see Technique 68).

You can tell Word to run PasteUnformatted
whenever you press Ctrl+V. If you paste any
other way (clicking the Paste icon, choosing
Edit➪Paste, right-clicking and choosing Paste, or
pressing the Insert key), Word pastes normally.
The second approach is what I prefer because
it runs fast and saves time — especially if you
follow the instructions in the first section of
this Technique to make the Insert key paste
normally, instead of going into overtype
mode. It’s the best use of the Insert key I
know. If you also set up Ctrl+V to paste unfor-
matted text, you then have two quick ways to
paste: Ctrl+V pastes unformatted text, and the
Insert key pastes normally.
To make PasteUnformatted run whenever you press
Ctrl+V
1.
Choose Tools➪Customize➪Commands.
Word brings up the Customize dialog box, as
shown in Figure 66-5.
2.
Make sure that Save In shows Normal.dot and
then click the Keyboard key.
You see the Customize Keyboard dialog box, as
shown in Figure 66-6.
4.
Between the line that reads Sub
PasteUnformatted() and the line that 
reads End Sub, type these two lines. (Note 
that the command starting with Selection
and ending with wdPasteText must appear 
on one line.)
On Error Resume Next
Selection.PasteSpecial
DataType:=wdPasteText
Comment lines begin with apostrophes (you
can see these in Figure 66-4) and don’t affect
the program. You can include as many com-
ments as you like.
The first command tells Word to ignore any
errors that it encounters. The second command
tells Word to run an Edit➪Paste Special, pasting
the contents of the Clipboard as plain text.
5.
Choose File➪Close and Return to Microsoft
Word.
Word reappears.
6.
Test the macro by copying anything you like to
the Clipboard, choosing Tools➪Macro➪Macros,
and double-clicking PasteUnformatted.
Word pastes the unadorned text into your docu-
ment. After you know the macro is working, you
need to find a way to make it work, other than
this long string of menu commands. The next
section has all the details.
This is a very fast, very specific macro: It pastes
only unformatted text. For example, if you
copy a picture to the Clipboard and then run
this macro, Word ignores the picture and
nothing gets pasted. It’s all text, all the time.

Assigning a Shortcut to the Pasting Macro

3.
In the Categories box, choose Macros. In the
Macros box, choose PasteUnformatted. Click in
the Press New Shortcut Key box and then press
Ctrl+V.
Word warns you that the Ctrl+V key combination
is currently assigned to EditPaste.
4.
Click the Assign button.
Word moves Ctrl+V to the Current Keys box.
5.
Click the Close button twice.
After the key combination is assigned, whenever you
press Ctrl+V, Word runs PasteUnformatted, slapping
the text, the plain text, and only the plain text into
your document.
• Figure 66-5: Go this way to assign a macro to a key
combination.
• Figure 66-6: Set Ctrl+V to run PasteUnformatted.
If you ever want to get Ctrl+V back so that it runs the
standard Word paste, do the following:

Choose Tools➪Customize➪Commands.
You get the Customize dialog box; refer to
Figure 66-5.
2.
Make sure that Save In shows Normal.dot and
then click the Keyboard key.
Word brings up the Customize Keyboard dialog
box; refer to Figure 66-6.

In the Categories box, choose Edit. In the
Commands box, choose EditPaste. Click in the

lthough Microsoft would have you think that all the Office applica-
tions work well together, that’s actually not the case. Cutting and
pasting within Excel is a breeze, but cutting and pasting between
Excel and other applications can become a big headache — unless you
use the macro that I show you how to create in this Technique.
When you paste text into a Word document, you usually want to paste
unformatted text. That’s what Technique 66 is all about. In Excel, the situ-
ation isn’t so clear-cut. Copying cells within Excel and copying text from
sources outside Excel work quite differently:

Copying and pasting cells within Excel: Most cutting and pasting in
Excel deals exclusively with Excel cells. Excel knows that if you copy a
bunch of cells, you probably want to paste the copied cells into new
cells, cell by cell. When you choose Edit➪Paste Special to copy and
paste cells within Excel, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 67-1.
It’s designed to work with the data typically crammed into Excel (and
is a far cry from the dialog box you get when you Paste Special in
Word). Although you have a lot of options for pasting cells, the
process works smoothly if you know what you want to do, because
Excel is comfortable working within its own boundaries.

Copying and pasting text from outside Excel: When you copy text
onto the Clipboard (from Word, a Web page, or any other source) and
paste it into Excel, Excel has to deal with the same fundamental ques-
tions as Word — namely, how you want the content to appear. When
you copy text to the Clipboard and then choose Edit➪Paste Special in
Excel, you get the options shown in Figure 67-2. If you find yourself fre-
quently copying text from various sources into your spreadsheets, you
probably want to strip formatting from the text before putting it in the
spreadsheet. The rest of this Technique is devoted to creating a macro
that delivers just that — and in a matter of seconds.
When Excel pastes text into a spreadsheet, it puts one paragraph in the
first target cell, the next paragraph in the cell below it, and so on. If you
copy five paragraphs to the Clipboard, click cell A1, choose Edit➪Paste
Special, and then choose one of the Text options, cells A1 through A5
each contain the contents of the first through fifth paragraphs.

Recording a Macro

• Figure 67-2: When you copy text to cells, Excel has to

Recording a Macro
Macros are just programs attached to Office docu-
ments. In theory at least, you record a macro to per-
form a specific task, and then play it back to repeat
the task. In practice, life is rarely that simple.
Although you have a dozen ways to write macros for
Excel, if you’ve never created an Excel macro before,
using the macro recorder has one big advantage:
The workbook that Excel uses to store macros —
personal.xls, sometimes called the Personal Macro
Workbook — doesn’t even exist unless and until
you do something (such as recording a macro) to
create it. By using the macro recorder, Excel takes
care of all the messy details of getting personal.xls
going.
I rarely recommend that people use the macro
recorder except when they’re in a tight spot —
specifically, the first time you set up an Excel
macro, or when you can’t figure out what in
the %$#@! Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
calls a particular action. The recorder isn’t able
to record most actions the way you want them
to be played back, and it isn’t the recorder’s
fault. For example, say you have a column of
numbers in Excel that ends at cell B6. If you’re
recording a macro and you click cell B7,
there’s no way the recorder can know whether
you want to jump to the first empty cell in col-
umn B or whether you just want to go to B7.
For tips on writing a macro in Excel without
the recorder, see Technique 68.
In the specific case of stripping formatting from text
prior to placing it in an Excel spreadsheet, the
recorder works like a champ. Here’s how to record
the macro that does the trick:
1.
Copy some text from Word or Internet Explorer
to the Clipboard.
2.
In Excel, choose Tools➪Macro➪Record New
Macro.
Excel shows you the Record Macro dialog box, as
shown in Figure 67-3.
3.
In the Macro Name box, type a name for the
macro. In the Shortcut Key box, type a key
that you would like to use as a shortcut. In the
Store Macro In box, choose Personal Macro
Workbook.
In Figure 67-3, I call the macro PasteUnformatted,
and I tell Excel to run PasteUnformatted every
time I press Ctrl+Shift+V.

Technique 67: Inserting Unformatted Text in Excel
452
• Figure 67-5: Perform an unformatted paste with the
macro recorder running.
6.
Click the first button on the Stop Recording
toolbar.
Excel stops recording the macro.
7.
From the Excel menu bar, choose File➪Exit.
8.
When Excel asks whether you want to save the
changes you made to Book1, click No.
9.
When Excel asks whether you want to save the
changes you made to the Personal Macro
Workbook, click Yes.
Your new macro, PasteUnformatted, gets saved
in personal.xls.
How Does personal.xls Work?
personal.xls is a weird workbook that Excel sticks in
its XLStart folder, typically C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\OFFICE11\XLSTART, the same place where Excel
puts book.xlt, the default workbook. (I talk about book.
xlt in Technique 34.) In most circumstances, personal.
xls contains only macros. And in many cases, it has only
recorded macros because macro programmers tend to pre-
fer to stick their own templates in XLStart.
When Excel starts, it automatically opens everything in the
XLStart folder. Because personal.xls is in the right place
at the right time, it comes along for the ride. That’s why you
can get at recorded macros whenever Excel is running.
• Figure 67-3: Set up the macro recorder here.
This dialog box won’t let you overwrite exist-
ing shortcut key combinations, so Ctrl+V —
the usual paste key combination — isn’t an
option. If you try to type Ctrl+V, Excel
changes it to Ctrl+Shift+V.
4.
Click OK.
The macro recorder starts. Excel shows you
the most bizarre toolbar in all of Officedom: a
stunted thing with two buttons called (I kid you
not) the Stop Recording toolbar (see Figure 67-4).
As long as you can see the Stop Recording tool-
bar, the macro recorder is working, recording
everything you do.
• Figure 67-4: The Stop Recording toolbar.
5.
Choose Edit➪Paste Special. Choose Text and
then click OK.
Excel dutifully pastes the text held on the
Clipboard into the Excel spreadsheet (see 
Figure 67-5).

Editing an Excel Macro
453
Editing an Excel Macro
In the preceding section, I show you how to record a
macro. The steps are basically the same in Word and
Excel.
Recording a macro is largely ineffectual in
PowerPoint, and the Outlook macro recorder
is just the Word macro recorder.
However, if you want to look a macro that you
recorded in Excel, you have to jump through some
relatively strange hoops. Here’s how:
1.
Start Excel.
When Excel starts, it opens all the workbooks in
the XLStart folder. If you’ve ever recorded a
macro in Excel, the recorder created a personal.
xls in the XLStart folder, so it gets opened, too.
(See the sidebar, “How Does personal.xls Work?”)
personal.xls is a hidden file: Excel doesn’t
show you anything about personal.xls
unless you specifically go in and tell Excel to
unhide it. Making a file hidden isn’t a security
technique: Anybody who bumps into the
Window menu can unhide a file. Rather,
hiding is a method to keep extraneous 
workbooks out of the way.
2.
Choose Window➪Unhide.
Excel shows you the Unhide dialog box, with
personal.xls notably present (see Figure 67-6).
• Figure 67-6: Before you can do anything with personal.
xls or its macros, you have to unhide it.
3.
Click personal.xls and then click OK to
unhide the file.
Excel returns with personal.xls showing.
4.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros.
You see the Macro dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 67-7.
• Figure 67-7: Excel allows you to open a macro only when
the workbook containing the macro is
unhidden.
5.
Click the Edit button.
The Visual Basic Editor (VBE) kicks in, with
Module1 from personal.xls showing (see 
Figure 67-8).
• Figure 67-8: What the PasteUnformatted macro really
looks like.

Technique 67: Inserting Unformatted Text in Excel
454
8.
When you’re back in Excel, choose
Window➪Hide to hide personal.xls.
If you don’t hide personal.xls, every time
you start Excel, it will show personal.xls
on the screen, and you have to do the extra
work of choosing File➪New to start a blank
workbook.
6.
If you want to make changes to the macro, 
you can at this point. For example, you can
delete this extraneous code without any 
problems:
, Link:=False, DisplayAsIcon:= _
False
7.
When you’re done making changes, choose
File➪Close and Return to Microsoft Excel.

Printing a Bunch 
of Spreadsheets —
Fast
I
must get mail from a dozen readers every month with the same ques-
tion: How do you print a folder full of spreadsheets?
The question comes under many guises. These folks need to print invoices
or stock inventory forms or employee evaluations or real estate appraisals
or statements or aged receivables or just about anything you can imagine
(taking a breath now), and they need to print them by the bucket. Paperless
office? HA! Maybe where you work, it’s paperless. Everyplace I’ve seen is
drowning in paper. Hard copy rules. What to do?
Write a macro!
Printing is precisely the kind of problem that’s well suited for a macro:
repetitive, easily defined, and boooooooring. It takes forever to click,
click, click, open, file, print, close, and open again. And it’s so easy to
skip a spreadsheet or to print one twice.
This Technique shows you how to write, from scratch, a Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) macro that runs in Excel. The macro itself is fairly sim-
ple but is also a huge timesaver for people who have to print large num-
bers of spreadsheets in batch jobs. The methods that I use to create the
macro should show you, via a very concrete example, how you can start
to use VBA to automate repetitive jobs that you encounter every day.
Most of what you read about macros either states or implies that
macros are good at automating repetitive tasks (thus saving you
time). That’s only part of the story. In fact, macros can do everything
that Excel (or Word) can do, and then some. VBA is a powerful, full-
fledged programming language. The fact that VBA sits inside Excel,
Word, and Access (and to a lesser extent, PowerPoint and Outlook)
shouldn’t deter you. Behind those pretty faces beats the heart of a
powerful programming beast. For more info about VBA, pick up a
copy of VBA For Dummies, 4th Edition (John Paul Mueller, Wiley).

Press the Tab key.
This puts your cursor in cell B1.
Actually, you can do just about anything in
Excel — create a chart, set headers and footers,
you name it — as long the macro recorder rec-
ognizes what you’ve done.
4.
Click Stop Recording on the Stop Recorder tool-
bar. It’s the first button.
You now have a new macro called Macro1. It only
moves the cursor to cell B1, but that’s okay.

Choose File➪Exit.

When Excel asks whether you want to save the
changes you made to the Personal Macro
Workbook, click Yes.
personal.xls is all set up and ready to go.
Building the PrintWorkbooks
Macro
In the preceding section, I show you how to create a
spreadsheet called personal.xls. Although Excel
uses personal.xls to hold recorded macros, you can
use the same file for your own porpoises. Or whales.
Talk about bloated code! (Sorry. Sometimes I start to
channel Groucho, and it hurts.)
Setting Up Excel for Macros
In Technique 67, I explain why the easiest and fastest
way to get started with Excel macros involves the
wimpy, under-aspirated Excel macro recorder. Refer
to the details there if you’re curious, but if you
haven’t yet created any macros in Excel, you need to
run the recorder once to get Excel set up properly —
specifically, to make sure personal.xls is ready to go.
As I explain in Technique 67, personal.xls
is a hidden file, stored in the XLStart folder.
Every time you start Excel, it opens all the files
in the XLStart folder. Thus, any macro you put
in personal.xls will be available every time
you start Excel.
1.
Start Excel. Choose Tools➪Macros➪Record
New Macro.
Excel shows you the Record Macro dialog box, as
shown in Figure 68-1.
• Figure 68-1: The fast, sure way to create the file
personal.xls. 
2.
Make sure that Store Macro In shows Personal
Macro Workbook, and then click OK.
Excel starts the macro recorder and shows you
that bizarre, tiny toolbar called Stop Recorder
(see the bottom-right of Figure 68-2).

Building the PrintWorkbooks Macro
457
Here I show you how to write a macro that you can
use to print all the workbooks in a folder. To write
the PrintWorkbooks macro
1.
Start Excel. Choose Window➪Unhide.
You see the Unhide dialog box, as shown in
Figure 68-3.
• Figure 68-3: Start by making personal.xls visible.
2.
Choose PERSONAL.XLS and click OK.
Excel shows you personal.xls, which looks like
any other empty workbook.
3.
Press Alt+F11.
Of the many ways to bring up the Visual Basic
Editor (VBE; see Figure 68-4), Alt+F11 is the fastest.
A brief introduction: The upper-left pane of
the VBE is the Project Explorer window, which
lets you move from workbook to workbook.
The lower left is the Properties window, which
occasionally holds important information
about the items you’ve selected. On the right
is the programming window (also known as
the code or Module window), where you type
your VBA program.
4.
In the Project Explorer window (upper left),
drill your way down to the program module
called Module1 in personal.xls.
The macro that you recorded appears onscreen
(refer to Figure 68-4).
• Figure 68-4: Work in the VBE.
A lot of the terminology that you see onscreen
at this point is typical computer gobbledy-
gook. Don’t let it throw you. All you really
need to know is that every .xls file (called a
VBAProject for no apparent reason) can con-
tain custom dialog boxes (called UserForms,
for no apparent reason) and programs (called
procedures, which they are, sorta). The custom
dialog boxes and programs are grouped
together into modules, which can be helpful if
you’re writing huge systems. You can break
the giant system down into lots of modules,
and program each one separately — but for
most people, modules just get in the way. If
you want to write a program (a macro) that
you can use in any worksheet, put it in a mod-
ule that’s inside personal.xls, the big
kahuna of projects.
5.
To put a new macro (er, program, uh, proce-
dure) in the module called Module1, choose
Insert➪Procedure.
VBA brings up the Add Procedure dialog box, as
shown in Figure 68-5. It’s automatically set to be
a Public (that is, available everywhere) Sub (a
subroutine or program). 
6.
In the Name box, type PrintWorkbooks (all one
word, no spaces), and then click OK.

Technique 68: Printing a Bunch of Spreadsheets — Fast
458
7.
Start by typing two lines after the Sub line,
which establish the variables that I use in the
macro:
Dim i As Integer
Dim FileNames As Variant
Note how VBA helps you as you type. As soon
as VBA identifies a word that you want to
type, press the Tab key, and VBA autocom-
pletes the text.
The variable i is set up as an integer. FileNames
is established as a Variant, which is sort of a
catch-all kind of variable that can be almost 
anything — text, number, array, and much more
(see Figure 68-7). (VBA calls this dimensioning —
Dim — but that’s another bit of archaic, arcane
computer jargon.)
• Figure 68-7: Set up the variables for the program.
• Figure 68-5: Create a new macro here.
VBA creates a new subroutine called
PrintWorkbooks, adorning it with the obligatory
Public Sub and End Sub statements (see 
Figure 68-6).
• Figure 68-6: The beginning of this subroutine is
PrintWorkbooks.
LISTING 68-1: THE PRINTWORKBOOKS MACRO
FileNames = Application.GetOpenFilename(,,”Choose workbooks”,,True)
If IsArray(FileNames) Then
For i = 1 To UBound(FileNames)
Workbooks.Open FileNames(i)
ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.PrintOut
ActiveWorkbook.Close (False)
Next i
End If

Running and Testing the Macro
459
8.
Type the rest of the macro shown in
Listing 68-1.
The final macro looks like Figure 68-8.
• Figure 68-8: The PrintWorkbooks macro.
Here’s how the macro works. First, it uses a Windows
function called GetOpenFilename to show a built-in
Windows dialog box that lets the user choose multi-
ple files. If the user picks any files at all, FileNames
turns into an array of the names of the files that were
chosen. (That’s why it was declared as a variant.) For
each file that the user chose, the macro opens the file,
prints it (actually, prints the worksheet in the work-
book that was active the last time the workbook was
closed), and then closes the workbook without sav-
ing changes — that’s what the (False) entry does.
If you’re ever curious about what a particular
VBA command does, click the command once
and then press F1. Visual Basic Help appears,
and although it’s deficient in many ways, at
least it will get you started.
Can’t figure out which command to use? Yeah,
that’s a huge problem. Of the many tricks, the
number-one timesaver goes by the unlikely
name of the Object Browser. (It seems like
everything in VBA is an object, eh?) To use the
Object Browser, press F2. Choose Excel from
the top drop-down list, type an associated
name in the second drop-down box (if all else
fails, try Application), and then press Enter.
Making Your Variables Typo-proof
Unless you change things, VBA lets you create new vari-
ables on-the-fly while you’re typing a program. That’s dan-
gerous. Say you have a variable called FileNames, which
you use throughout a program — except once, where you
accidentally type it as FileName. Excel lets you create the
new variable called FileName at the location where you
misspelled it. As a result, your program has two different
variables — FileName and FileNames — and it’s deucedly
difficult to find or correct the error.
The solution? Option Explicit. When you have an
Option Explicit statement at the beginning of a mod-
ule, Excel requires you to declare your variable names
before you use them. So, for example, you have to declare
FileNames as a variant (see Step 7 in this section). Later,
when you’re typing your program, the minute you acciden-
tally type FileName, Excel looks and can’t find any declara-
tion for FileName. It immediately flags your mistyping as a
mistake, and all is right with the world.
I strongly recommend that everyone take a moment to do
the following. Choose Tools➪Options; on the Editor tab,
mark the Require Variable Declaration check box. That
way, all new modules will automatically get an Option
Explicit as soon as they’re created.
Running and Testing the Macro
Here’s how to debug (test) the PrintWorkbooks
macro, which I showed you how to develop in the
preceding section:
1.
With your cursor anywhere inside the
PrintWorkbooks macro, choose Debug➪
Step Into (or press F8).
VBA starts to run your program. The first line —
Public Sub PrintWorkbooks() — gets run. VBA
highlights it and puts an arrow next to that line,
to show it’s the one being run (see Figure 68-9).
2.
Press F8.
VBA jumps down to the next executable line, the
one that starts FileNames =.

Technique 68: Printing a Bunch of Spreadsheets — Fast
460
6.
Continue pressing F8.
VBA steps through each line in the program,
runs it, and then goes on to the next line. Keep
pressing F8 until you’re comfortable that the
macro works properly.
7.
When you’re sure the macro works correctly,
choose Run➪Reset.
That stops the macro.
8.
Choose File➪Close and Return to Microsoft
Excel. Back in Excel, chose Window➪Hide to
hide personal.xls. Then choose File➪Exit.
When Excel asks whether you want to save
changes in your Personal Macro Workbook,
click Yes.
Excel is back to normal, and your PrintWorkbooks
macro will be available whenever you start Excel
again.
Assigning the Macro to a Button
You can always run a macro by choosing Tools➪
Macro➪Macros, selecting the macro, and then click-
ing Run.
However, setting up any macro so it runs when you
click a button on a toolbar is a much faster way.
Here’s how:
1.
Start Excel and make sure that your macro is
available. (It will be if it’s in personal.xls.)
Then choose Tools➪Customize➪Commands.
Excel shows you the Commands tab of the
Customize dialog box, as shown in Figure 68-11.
2.
On the left, under Categories, select Macros. On
the right, click Custom Button, drag the cursor
to a convenient location on an Excel toolbar,
and then drop it.
In Figure 68-12, I drag the custom button to the
right of the ? (question mark) icon on the
Standard toolbar. You’re stuck with the smiley
face icon for a moment. Patience, patience.
• Figure 68-9: Run in debug mode, one line at a time.
3.
Press F8.
VBA runs the FileNames = line and opens the
Choose Workbooks dialog box (see Figure 68-10).
• Figure 68-10: The GetOpenFilename command opens
this dialog box onscreen, allowing you to
choose multiple files.
4.
Choose any files you wish to print, and then
click Open.
VBA returns to the next line in the program, the
one that starts with If IsArray().
5.
Press F8.
Assuming that you chose some files to print (and
thus FileNames is an array filled with the names
of the files you chose), VBA moves on to the For
i = 1 line, which is highlighted with an arrow
next to it.

Right-click the smiley face button and choose
Assign Macro.
Excel brings up the Assign Macro dialog box, as
shown in Figure 68-13.
4.
Select PERSONAL.XLS!PrintWorkbooks and
then click OK.
The macro PrintWorkbooks is now assigned to
the button; if you click the button, Excel runs
PrintWorkbooks. You go back into the 
Customize dialog box.
• Figure 68-13: Assign the PrintWorkbooks macro to the

5.
Right-click the smiley button on the toolbar and
type a new name in the Name box.
6.
Right-click the button and choose either
Change Button Image or Edit Button Image.
Pick a new picture from the choices on offer. 
Get rid of that smiley face, replacing it with
something you can remember (and stomach).
7.
In the Customize dialog box, click the Close
button.
From that point on, every time you click the but-
ton, Excel runs the PrintWorkbooks macro.
If you ever want to get rid of the button or
move it, choose Tools➪Customize. Then 
either click and drag the button off the toolbar
(which deletes it completely) or drag it 
onto a different toolbar of your choosing.

Y
ou probably know — or at least have a sneaky suspicion — that
the documents, workbooks, and presentation files that you work
on contain all sorts of buried information about you. It’s true.
Ask Tony Blair, whose governing team in the UK was shaken — not
stirred — about a publicly posted Word document highlighting intelli-
gence about Iraqi weapons. Among the many scandals that ensued
regarding this document, the British government could hardly have 
been pleased to discover that buried in the text was a list of the 
people who modified the document. (See Richard Smith’s analysis at

This Technique isn’t as much a timesaver as a buttsaver. Read it and
you’ll see why.
Seeing the Hidden Stuff
The Internet must have millions of Word doc files available for download-
ing. And the vast majority of them abound with hidden, personal, and
sometimes embarrassing information.
Want to go doc Dumpster Diving? Here’s how:
1.
Find a Word document that might contain some interesting tidbits.
You might have one sitting on your hard drive, or you can look for one
on the Internet with a tool like Google’s Advanced Search.
2.
Double-click the file to open it in Word. Choose File➪Properties➪
Summary.
Word brings up the Summary information, which usually includes the
name of the so-called official author (see Figure 69-1).

There’s nothing illegal, immoral, or fattening
about doc Dumpster Diving. Everything you

ence? You now know where to look for the,

Moral of the story: Don’t post Word docu-
ments on the Web and don’t distribute them
outside of your organization. Instead, use a
PDF, which is the format that Adobe Acrobat
developed, or some alternative such as an RTF
file (which Word can produce directly). See a

every single version is available to anyone who
opens your document. Choose File➪Versions to

If you do, save the current, latest version of the

I, personally, use and swear by Metadata Assistant,
which is a $79 document cleanser that gets rid of all
the potentially embarrassing information that I know
about. It runs inside Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, so
you can clean a document by clicking a menu or you
can run it on a folder full of docs. It also watches as
you’re sending out messages to see whether any
Office docs are attached, offering to clean them as
they go. This is one, slick product (with 1,000,000
users) that works with Office 97 to 2003. See
www.payneconsulting.com for details.
And, of course, you’d be wrong.
Throughout this book, I emphasize how
important it is to use the tools at your disposal
to keep your personal information out of doc-
uments. Unfortunately, the tools don’t cover
all the bases in Office 2003 (and none of them
are turned on by default). The tools only
scratch the surface in Office XP, and Office 97
and 2000 basically have no privacy tools at all.
Word 2003 goes a long way toward removing hidden
information, particularly if you follow my recommen-
dations in Technique 16 and change Word’s default
security settings for all new blank documents.
In early 2004, Microsoft released a Hidden Data
Removal Tool that removes most (but not all) hid-
den data in Office 2003 and XP documents (Word
.doc, Excel .xls, and PowerPoint .ppt/.pps files). It’s
a snarly, buggy program (see www.woodyswatch.com/
office/archtemplate.asp?v9-n01) that nonetheless
removes most potentially embarrassing data, most
of the time. You can get a copy at www.microsoft.com/
downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=144E54ED-D43E-
42CA-BC7B-5446D34E5360.
If you’re using Word 2000 or earlier, you can do a lit-
tle bit to remove some of this embarrassing hidden
information — for example, you can manually delete
the information in a document’s Properties box —
but in many cases, you’re up the proverbial creek. In
particular, Word 97 and 2000 bury the names of the
last ten people who edited the document — and
there’s nothing you can do about it.
Hidden revision tracking names only touch the tip 
of the iceberg. Wary Word 97 and 2000 users — and
Word 2003 and 2002 users who don’t run the Hidden
Data Removal Tool — must also watch out for

Fast Saves: This buggy-whip-era feature can
leave huge chunks of embarrassing data in your
documents by storing the deltas — the changes
you make to a document — while leaving the
original, edited, and even deleted data intact. I
talk about it, and insist that you disable it, in
Technique 15.

Printing
Personalized
Greetings in Batches
I
’ll never forget the first time I tried to use Word version 1.1 to print a
Christmas newsletter and envelopes for all my Christmas cards. I
spent days — days — trying to get Word to work right. The whole
experience left me so frustrated I almost gave up on Word for good.
In retrospect, I probably should’ve.
Over the years, Word’s gotten a little bit better, and now Outlook pro-
vides a way to store all the names and addresses. But some of the old
glitches are still there and, frankly, it all seems to be strung together with
baling wire and chewing gum. I frequently wonder whether anybody at
Microsoft has ever used Office to print greeting cards, newsletters, and
envelopes. I doubt it.
This Technique covers all the tricks that I’ve gleaned for printing cards,
newsletters, and envelopes. Many of the tricks apply to any printed
newsletter, form letter, or list — or anything else that requires a mail
merge.
Understanding Mass Mailing
Every year I get hundreds — sometimes more than a thousand — 
messages from Woody’s Office Watch readers about surviving Christmas,
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, ’Id al-Fitr, Visaka Puja, New Year’s, and other holiday
greeting card times. (Okay, okay. I’ll stop trying to be politically correct,
and use the term greeting card in its generic sense. Great Pumpkin any-
body? Sheesh.)
The cause of all the Office mass-mailing angst: Word and Outlook, and the
way they’re hooked together. You folks have spent hundreds of dollars

well as a key Office feature — Word’s mail merge.
The programs don’t work the same way, and the
merge doesn’t do a great job of bridging the
gaps. You’re doomed to failure if you don’t use
Word and Outlook in the correct order. Follow
the steps here, and avoid the temptation to jump
back and forth between Word and Outlook.
Entering and Updating Contacts
Every good mail merge starts with a clean mailing
list. If you’re lucky, most of your card recipients are
already in your Outlook Contacts list, and their mail-
ing addresses (or e-mail addresses) are accurate and
up-to-date. If you aren’t so lucky, you have a lot of
typing in your future.
If you already have your address list set up in
Excel or Access or even in a Word table, con-
sider transferring them to Outlook. You’ll save
yourself a lot of time and headache in the long
run because you don’t have to maintain two
separate sets of addresses. Word is capable of
running mail merges with the names coming
from Excel, Access, or even Word. But it’s a
whole lot simpler if you work from Outlook’s
Contacts (if you know the tricks).
Heed this school-of-hard-knocks advice:

Set the personal greeting in Outlook Contacts. If
you want to print a personal greeting on each
card or newsletter, or add a personal greeting to
each e-mail message, you have to stick the greet-
ing in every Outlook Contact destined to receive
a card or message. For example, if you want your
holiday newsletter to begin Dear Cliff, Carolyn,
Zane & Joel, you must have an entry on the fam-
ily’s Contact card that reads Cliff, Carolyn, Zane
& Joel. Otherwise, Word won’t be able to gener-
ate the name you want.
Most of my Christmas cards go out to friends,
and I usually greet them by their first names.
I’ve found that the best way to get a decent
salutation is to use the First Name field on
for the fanciest word processor and information
manager on the planet, but you can’t get it to do
something as simple as printing greeting cards.
Believe me, you aren’t alone.
This Technique includes all the details you need to

Set up a mailing list. This consists of Outlook
Contacts who are specifically earmarked for
receiving cards and/or e-mail messages.

Print customized cards or newsletters. These
can contain personalized information (such as a
Dear Cliff, Carolyn, Zane & Joel line) drawn from
the Outlook Contacts entry.

Print custom envelopes. You can make these go
with the cards or newsletters.

Send e-mail messages instead. After all, some
people prefer bit-based greetings.
Don’t let the greeting-card bias throw you.
The steps in this Technique also work if you
want to print and mail a small-circulation, hard
copy newsletter, advertisement, or brochure to
your customers, any time of year. Ho, ho, ho.
I’ve used the methods in this Technique to run print
mailings, delivered through the U.S. Postal Service,
up to about 5,000 pieces. It ain’t easy, but it can be
done.
Before you start, you need to understand two givens:

Spending upfront time: The first time you use a
computer to send out cards, newsletters, or mes-
sages, prepare to invest a lot of time and effort.
With rare exceptions, doing it all by hand the
first time is almost always faster and easier. You
won’t start seeing the timesaving benefits of
automating the process until the second time
you do it — or maybe even the third.

Massaging Word and Outlook: Mass mailings (or
e-mailings) set up this way require two very dif-
ferent Office programs (Outlook and Word) as

Entering and Updating Contacts
467
each Contact for the names of the people I
want to list by name in my Christmas cards
and family newsletters. (For example, the First
Name field for Cliff’s family reads Cliff,
Carolyn, Zane & Joel.) I leave the First Name
field for companies blank.

Separate regular cards from e-mails. Set up 
separate categories for hard copy Christmas
card recipients and e-mail Christmas card 
recipients. That makes it easy to separate the dif-
ferent classes of recipients when you run a merge.
Personally, I use three categories for Christmas
cards. The Envelope Only group consists of
companies and business associates who
require a printed envelope for their card but
don’t get my (captivating!) family newsletter.
The Wired group gets an e-mail message. And
the Whole Enchilada group gets a printed
newsletter and envelope.
If you use this Technique to print company
newsletters or custom reports, you should
spend some time thinking about the different
categories of Contacts you need. In Technique
61, I talk about setting up newsletter sub-
scribers with a Newsletter category. Pick a cat-
egory or two (or three or ten) that work for
you and your situation.
Here’s how to set up your greeting card categories:
1.
Establish your card categories by starting
Outlook, moving to Contacts (typically by
choosing Go➪Contacts), and then choosing
Edit➪Categories.
Outlook responds with the Categories dialog
box.
2.
Click the Master Category List button.
You see the Master Category List in Figure 70-1.
3.
One by one, add the categories that you want
to use for your Christmas card lists by typing
the category name and clicking Add.
In Figure 70-1, I add the _XmasBus category for
the Envelope Only business contacts, _XmasMsg
for my wired friends who should receive e-mail
messages, and _XmasCard for those folks who
get the full hard copy treatment.
Putting an underscore ( _ ) at the beginning of
the category name assures you that the name
will float to the top in any alphabetized list.
That can be very handy.
• Figure 70-1: Add your Christmas card categories to the
list.
Although nothing is wrong with using the pre-
built Holiday and Holiday Cards categories, I
always have a hard time remembering who
belongs to which group. For example, if Bill
Gates is one of my Contacts, should he go in
the Holiday or the Holiday Cards category or
both? By using my custom categories, it’s easy
to decide: Bill goes in the _XmasCard cate-
gory, so I can send him news each year on
how the family is doing. Hey, maybe he’ll
invite me to his annual retreat. . . .

After you have the new Contacts entered, take a few
moments to make sure you have all your Contacts
correctly assigned to each category. Here’s the fast
way:
1.
Bring up your Contacts list (choose Go➪
Contacts). Choose View➪Arrange By➪
Categories.
Outlook shows you a list of all your Contacts,
arranged by category (see Figure 70-2).
2.
To show or hide the list of individual contacts
in each category, click the + or – button to the
left of the category name.
• Figure 70-2: The bird’s eye view of all your Contacts and
their categories.
3.
Scan each category’s list. If you find a Contact
who should not be in a particular category, right-
click the Contact, choose Categories, and clear
the check box next to the offending category.
If you find many Contacts who should be in
one particular category, Ctrl+click or Shift+click
to select them all. Then right-click, choose
Categories, and enable the check box next to
the category you want to add the Contacts to.
With the categories nailed down, make sure that the
folks who will receive your holiday e-mail greetings
have valid e-mail addresses, and that those destined
4.
After you add the categories that you need,
click OK twice to go back to Outlook.
If you use a handheld computer (or any other
computer that’s synched to your Outlook
Contacts) make sure that its software is smart
enough to maintain these custom categories.
Some software clobbers the categories, either
going into the handheld or coming back out.
Make a test run by setting a custom category
on one Contact (see the next series of steps),
synching with your handheld, and then synch-
ing back. If your handheld is going to blast
away your custom categories, it’s better to find
out before you go to all the work of assigning
categories to everybody in your Contacts list.
After you set up your categories, you can add
Contacts to those categories in one of two ways:

Adding existing Contacts: Click and drag
Contacts to the appropriate category.
You can assign a whole bunch of Contacts to
a category by choosing View➪Arrange By➪
Categories. Then select the Contacts that you
want to add and click and drag the bunch onto
the appropriate Categories entry (see the
upcoming Figure 70-2).

Adding new Contacts: As you add people to
your Contacts list, you can assign categories to
the contact while you’re at it. Just click the
Categories button at the bottom of the Contact’s
record and mark the checkboxes in the
Categories dialog box that appears.
Checking Contacts
In the preceding section, I talk about creating good
Contact records for everyone on your greeting card
list. In this section, I show you how to double-check
your Contacts and make sure that all the data is in
place.

If you just finished the preceding steps, you can
see your Contacts in category view. If not, bring
up your Contacts list (choose Go➪Contacts).
Choose View➪Arrange By➪Category.
Outlook shows you your Contacts in category
view (refer to Figure 70-2).
2.
Right-click one of the field names (Full Name,
Company, File As, and so on) and choose Field
Chooser.
Outlook brings up the Field Chooser dialog box
(see Figure 70-3).
• Figure 70-3: Add a new field to category view.
3.
Select Mailing Address and drag it to the left of
the File As field up on the bar. When you see a
red arrow indicating that the Mailing Address
field will be inserted (see Figure 70-4), release
the mouse button.
Outlook makes the Contacts’ mailing addresses
visible.
4.
Click the drop-down arrow at the top of the
Field Chooser dialog and choose E-mail Fields.
5.
Click the E-mail field and drag it to the left of
the File As field.
Outlook shows you the e-mail address for each of
your Contacts.

messages (see Figure 70-5).

template or a piece of art — but don’t follow
its advice on running holiday card mail
merges! MS hasn’t gotten it right yet, 
despite trying for ten years.
Do not run the Mail Merge Wizard in Word.
Word will let you use Contacts in a merge ’til
the cows come home, but the glue that binds
Word and Outlook isn’t smart enough to show
Word the categories. Yeah, Microsoft ran out
of money. 
3.
When you’re done with the static part of the
newsletter, close the document and shut down
Word.
WordMail has a reputation for gumming up the
works when you try to do anything complicated
with Outlook while Word is running. The easiest,
most reliable solution is to just say No to Word.
4.
Start Outlook. Bring up the Contacts list (choose
Go➪Contacts). Choose View➪Arrange By➪
Categories. Click the + sign next to the category
that you want to send newsletters to. Then select
all the Contacts in the category by clicking the
first Contact in the category, holding down the
Shift key, and clicking the last.
5.
Choose Tools➪Mail Merge.
Outlook brings up the Mail Merge Contacts dia-
log box (see Figure 70-6).
6.
Under Contacts, select the Only Selected
Contacts radio button. Under Document File,
click the Browse button and choose the Word
document that you created. Click OK.
If you get weird messages about The process
cannot access the file because it is in use by
another process — or gobbledygook of that 
ilk — chances are good that you didn’t follow
my instructions precisely and left Outlook 
running while working in Word (or vice versa).
Be careful. Thar be tygers here. Close Word if
you’re working in Outlook. Close Outlook if
you’re working in Word. Then try again.
Printing Personalized Newsletters
In the preceding sections, I show you fast and accu-
rate ways to get your Christmas card list into
Outlook. In this section, I explain how to print
newsletters.
If your printer has an automatic envelope
feeder, you might think about interleaving
newsletters and envelopes. That is, print the
envelope for the Ables, then the family
newsletter for the Ables, then the envelope for
the Bakers, then the newsletter for the Bakers,
and so on. Don’t do it. Word’s support for
attaching envelopes to documents is a pain in
the neck, and if just one envelope or newslet-
ter gets screwed up, recovering from the
problem can take an Act of Congress. 
Here’s how to perform a mail merge — for family
newsletters, company newsletters, flyers, or any-
thing else that strikes your fancy. Be very careful to
follow these steps precisely:
1.
Follow the steps in the preceding sections to
get your newsletter contacts in good shape,
assigned to the correct category, and with 
thoroughly vetted mailing addresses. Then
shut down Outlook.
If you use the categories that I suggest, you will
be working with the _XmasCard category.
2.
Start Word. Put together the static part of the
newsletter — the part that will be the same for
everybody in the mailing.
Don’t worry about the Dear Cliff, Carolyn, Zane &
Joel part just yet. Work on the stuff about the cat
going in for its first round of psychotherapy 
and how the neighbor’s cattle keep eating your
petunias.

• Figure 70-6: If you want to be able to select your
Contacts by category, run the mail merge

After Outlook spins its wheels for a bit, it opens
the static document in Word, attaches the merge
data from your Contacts list to the document,
and shows the Mail Merge toolbar.
7.
Immediately choose File➪Save As and save the
document with a new name.
8.
With the saved document still open, start by
typing Dear and a space where you want a salu-
tation line to appear (so you see Dear Bill on
one newsletter and Dear Cliff, Carolyn, Zane
& Joel on another one).
9.
Click the Insert Merge Fields icon, which sits
immediately to the left of the Insert Word Field
button.
Word brings up the Insert Merge Field dialog box
(see Figure 70-7).
10.
Select the First_Name line, then click the Insert
button. The Cancel button turns into a Close
button. Click Close.
Word puts a merge field — a placeholder that’s
filled in with each Contact record, in turn — into
the document. The chevrons (<< >>) surround
the merge field, indicating that the data gets
pulled from Contact records (see Figure 70-8).
11.
Type a comma.
This inserts a comma at the end of Dear
<<First_Name>>.
• Figure 70-7: Choose the field(s) that you want to pull
from the Contact record.

records — in this case, from each Contact’s
record.

Save the document with a new name.
18.
Print a sample page by choosing File➪Print,
selecting the Current Page radio button, and
clicking OK. If the sample looks good, make
sure you have enough paper on hand and then
go ahead and print the document.
If you’re printing a lot of newsletters, expect all
sorts of problems — printer jams, the ink or
toner going kaput, a playful spider suddenly
deciding to make your fuse box his home. If
your print run gets clobbered, don’t fret.
Simply pry out the spider’s remaining seven
legs, open the final merged document, locate
the bad newsletter (probably via Edit➪Find),
and then reprint any botched copies by choos-
ing File➪Print and selecting the Current Page
radio button of the Print dialog box.
Printing Envelopes
In the preceding sections, I show you how to set up a
Contacts list with appropriately defined categories,
and then run a mail merge to produce newsletters
(or brochures, flyers, whatever). In this section, I
struggle with envelopes, which are far more difficult
than they should be.
To print envelopes
1.
Start Outlook. Bring up the Contacts list
(Go➪Contacts). Choose View➪Arrange By➪
Categories. Click the + sign next to the cat-
egory that needs envelopes. Then select all
the Contacts in the category by clicking the
first Contact in the category, holding down
the Shift key, and clicking the last.
If you use the categories that I suggest at the
beginning of this Technique, you need to run
two sets of envelopes — one for the folks in
the _XmasCard category and one for the folks
in the _XmasBus category.
12.
Click the ABC icon, found to the right of the big
Insert Word Field button.
Word performs the merge, showing you the
result of merging with the first Contact in your
selected category (see Figure 70-9).
• Figure 70-9: The results of merging with my first
_XmasCard contact, Elizabeth Sharp.
13.
To see how the rest of your merged newsletters
will look, click the right and left buttons flank-
ing the number 1 on the Mail Merge toolbar.
14.
Flip back and forth between looking at the
merge fields and the merged documents them-
selves by clicking the ABC icon. Insert merge
fields to your heart’s content, clicking to the
right and left of the 1 to make sure that all your
merged newsletters look right.
15.
When you’re happy with the result, choose
File➪Save. Then click the Merge to New
Document button, which is way out on the 
right end of the Mail Merge toolbar.
Word asks whether you want to merge all the
records or just some of them.
16.
To merge all the records, click the All button
and then click OK.
Word produces a big document called Letters1,
with one page for each record in your selected
Contacts category.

3.
Under Contacts, make sure that the Only

Then at the lower left, under Document Type,

Outlook cranks up Word, presenting you with the
rather strange warning about the Setup button.

Word throws you back into a generations-old
interface: the Mail Merge Helper.
5.
Under Number 1 of the Mail Merge Helper,

box (see Figure 70-11). Hint: It’s the same dialog
box you would see if you chose Tools➪Letters
and Mailings➪Envelopes and Labels➪Options.
6.
Make any changes that you need to make to the
envelope printing options. (If you’ve been
printing envelopes on this machine all the time,
you don’t need to make any changes.) Click OK.
The Mail Merge Helper dialog box returns.
• Figure 70-11: Change envelope printing settings here.
7.
Click Close to get rid of the Mail Merge Helper.
Word shows you the skeleton of an envelope, as
in Figure 70-12. It’s pretty bizarre — and if you
can’t see paragraph marks (Technique 15), you
won’t even know what’s there.
8.
In the upper-left corner of the skeleton, type
the return name and address.
You can also add a picture, WordArt, or anything
else that strikes your fancy.
9.
Click once in front of the paragraph mark in
the middle of the envelope. Then click the
Insert Merge Fields icon on the Mail Merge
toolbar, found to the left of the big Insert Word
Field button.

records or just some of them.

Envelopes1, with one envelope for each record
in your selected Contacts category.
18.
Save the document with a new name.
19.
Print the document and watch the envelopes
come flying out of your printer.
E-mailing Holiday Greetings
Sending out a holiday newsletter over e-mail
requires the same steps as sending out any other
electronic newsletter. See Technique 61. You need to
work with the category that you’ve chosen for your
holiday e-mails, of course — the ones I put in
_XmasMsg earlier in this Technique.
• Figure 70-12: An envelope skeleton with the Mail Merge
toolbar.
10.
If you’re sending envelopes to individuals,
click the Full_Name field, click Insert, and then
click Close. If the envelopes are headed to com-
panies, click the Company field, click Insert,
and then click Close.
That puts a <<Full_Name>> merge field at the top
of the addressee location.

Press Enter.

Creating Versatile
Watermarks
Y
ou know all about Word watermarks, right? Typically, you put a
watermark on a document that reads DRAFT or CONFIDENTIAL or
some such, usually slanted across the page, almost always in a
light gray color.
As long as you can live with Word’s built-in choices for font and color 
and you want the text to run at a 45-degree angle (or boringly horizon-
tal), putting a watermark in a document only takes a couple of clicks.
Surprisingly, though, customizing a watermark isn’t that much more diffi-
cult. You can use text of your own choosing, or run the text at a slightly
greater or lesser angle, or format it with a picture fill or a gradient color.
You can even choose a different watermark for the first page of a docu-
ment. Fun stuff.
This Technique takes you through the steps.
Setting a Standard Watermark
In the simplest case, putting a watermark on a document — grayed-out
text such as DRAFT or DO NOT COPY that sits underneath the text of the
document — couldn’t be easier:
1.
Open the document to which you want to add a watermark.
2.
Choose Format➪Background➪Printed Watermark.
Word shows you the Printed Watermark dialog box (see Figure 71-1).
3.
Select the Text Watermark radio button.
Picture watermarks also work well and can serve as a very profes-
sional adjunct to a well laid-out letterhead (see Technique 23). The
fancy manipulation methods in the remainder of this Technique apply
only to text watermarks.

• Figure 71-2: A document with a CONFIDENTIAL

Modifying Watermark WordArt
You probably think that a Word watermark is some
sort of weird internal thing that Word carries along
with the document — say, something like the docu-
ment formatting or page setup. Not so. A watermark
is just a piece of WordArt that Word sticks in the
document’s header.
I talk about WordArt in Techniques 23 and 64.
Also find extensive coverage at www.uwec.
edu/help/Office00/edwordart.htm.
Admittedly, a watermark doesn’t look like WordArt
sitting in the header — after all, you’re accustomed
to seeing page headings in headers — but in fact,
• Figure 71-1: Adding a standard watermark is easy.
4.
Choose the boilerplate text that you want to
appear in the watermark or type your own text
in the Text box.
You get to choose from boilerplate watermark
text entries, such as CONFIDENTIAL, DO NOT COPY,
SAMPLE, and URGENT. If you don’t find precisely
what you want, type your own entry. You can
always change it later (see the next section).
5.
Change the Font, Size, Color, and/or Layout if
you like. Then click OK.
Word creates the watermark according to your
specifications (see Figure 71-2).
Unless you change it, a watermark prints on
every page in the document, precisely as you
see onscreen. If you want a watermark only on
the first page of a document, see the upcom-
ing section, “Making Watermarks Appear on
the First Page Only.”
For most people, watermarks end there. For you
timesavers, you’ve only just begun.

Modifying Watermark WordArt
477
the watermark is just a WordArt picture that’s
anchored to the document’s (first page) header.
Because a watermark is a simple piece of WordArt,
you can modify it with very little effort:
1.
If you have a document with a watermark
handy, open it. Otherwise, follow the steps in
the preceding section to create one.
It’s much easier to see what’s going on if you
set the Zoom to Whole Page.
2.
Choose View➪Header and Footer.
Word shows you the headers and footers in the
document.
3.
To select the watermark, hover your cursor
over the watermark until it turns into a four-
headed arrow; then click once.
As you can see in Figure 71-3, the watermark is a
picture with sizing handles on the edges and cor-
ners, a rotation dot at the top, and an extruding
square at the bottom. The anchor for the water-
mark is attached to the first paragraph mark in
the header. (I talk about picture anchors in
Technique 24.)
4.
Modify the watermark.
 Move it: Click it and drag it.
 Enlarge/reduce it: Click and drag the resizing
handles on the edges or corners.
 Rotate it: Click the rotation dot and drag.
 Change the slant of the characters: Click the
extruding square at the bottom and drag it.
5.
To change the text in the watermark, double-
click the watermark.
Word brings up the Edit WordArt Text dialog box,
as shown in Figure 71-4.
• Figure 71-3: The watermark’s anchor, rotation dot, and

• Figure 71-6: Choose textures or pictures to fill your

Making Watermarks Appear 
on the First Page Only
Because the watermark is anchored to the para-
graph mark in the header, setting up a document so
the watermark only appears on the first page of the
document is easy:
1.
Create a watermark by using the steps in the
first section in this Technique.
Don’t bother customizing the watermark just 
yet. (Word has a bug that eliminates your cus-
tomizing when you place a watermark only on
the first page.)
6.
Type your new text for the watermark, format
it if you like, and then click OK.
Your modified text appears in the watermark
(see Figure 71-5).
• Figure 71-5: Changing the text is very fast and easy —
you aren’t limited to the boilerplate choices.
7.
To add fill effects to the watermark (say, using
a picture of a flag to fill in the text, or applying
gradient shadings), choose Format➪WordArt➪
Colors and Lines. In the Color drop-down box,
pick Fill Effects. From there, the choices are
nearly limitless (see Figure 71-6).

Click View and make sure that Header and

If Header and Footer is selected, click it again.
You want to be in the body of the document —
not the header or footer.

same watermark on both the first and second
pages.

Hover your mouse cursor over the second
page’s watermark until it turns into a four-
headed arrow. Then click once to select the
watermark.
8.
Press Delete.
The watermark disappears from the second (and
subsequent) pages.
9.
Go back to the first page and edit the water-
mark any way you like.
The watermark appears on the first page only.
You can use the same steps to create two dif-
ferent watermarks — one for the first page and
the other for all subsequent pages — in a doc-
ument. You can also delete the watermark on
the first page but leave it on the second and
all subsequent pages.

Building (And
Stealing) E-mail
Stationery
I
’ve always detested e-mail stationery. That is, I used to detest e-mail
stationery until I got a message from somebody who works for one of
the big, computer PR agencies, and his stationery bowled me over —
simple, clean, good-looking, functional.
I immediately stopped using my old plain-text signatures and jumped
over to formatted e-mail, specifically so I could use Outlook stationery.
That’s big jump for an old buzzard like me. Until I made the leap, I, too,
grumbled about the bloated messages and cutesy formatting that so 
frequently accompanies formatted e-mail.
Yeah, I’m nostalgic. I miss those funny ASCII-art pictures of cavorting
chipmunks and guys peeking over the tops of walls — and guys peeking
over tops of walls looking at cavorting chipmunks. But this is progress.
And the thought of stealing a bit of stationery from Microsoft’s PR
agency . . . well, it was just too good to pass up.
Here’s how to build, buy or, uh, borrow some stationery of your own.
Using Built-in Stationery
The world of e-mail message senders falls neatly into two camps:

The old buzzards: These curmudgeons insist that the only good e-mail
is a plain, text e-mail. Plain ol’ ASCII text e-mail is fast, small, and reli-
able. And although it can be read by any e-mail program on the planet,
it’s also booooring. Plus, it’s hard for novices to understand *why*
those messages have _all_ of those funny ;-) character things in them
<gd&rvvf>.

The young buzzards . . . er, Turks: These hipsters frankly don’t care
whether their messages take 20,000 bytes instead of 7,000. Formatted
e-mail (also known as HTML e-mail) gives you the opportunity to use
bold and italic text, change fonts around, use color, add pictures, and
the like. But it’s also big, slow, and prone to occasional problems (from
e-mail programs that don’t work right, and there are some). And don’t
72
Technique

Using Built-in Stationery
481
forget formatted e-mail’s worst sin: an appalling
tendency to bring out the cute in those who use
it. Bah.
If you want to use Outlook stationery, you have to
use formatted e-mail. That means you tread per-
ilously close to the line that separates believers in
the utilitarian nature of e-mail from those who never
got beyond AOL Instant Messenger. J
Each specific stationery holds up to five different
items:

A default message font (style, size, treatment,
and color)

Fonts for headings and links

A background color

A picture (which typically repeats along the left
and/or right edges of the message)

Boilerplate text
Note, however, that Outlook’s tools for constructing
stationery don’t support all the above items, and
none of Microsoft’s built-in stationery includes all
five items.
Here are the two completely different — and mad-
deningly different — ways of choosing a default sta-
tionery for new Outlook messages:

Use Outlook. If you set the default stationery in
Outlook, a set of rudimentary tools lets you edit
the stationery’s background and picture, but no
tools are available for specifying the font that’s
used when replying to or forwarding messages.

Use Word. If you set the default stationery in
Word, you have more choices for the stationery
because you can also use Word Themes. On the
other hand, there’s stationery available in
Outlook (such as the Notebook, which I like!)
that simply isn’t available in Word. In Word, you
get better tools for changing the font that’s used
when you reply to or forward a message, but
there are no tools at all for changing the back-
ground or picture. Most damning, you can set
default stationery in Word that isn’t available in
Outlook — or even in parts of Word. It’s a bizarre
situation.
In general, you’re better off setting the default
stationery in Word. But if you run into prob-
lems or you can’t find the stationery you want
in Word, hop over to Outlook and try to sort it
all out there.
Setting up stationery in Word
To set the default stationery in Word — and not
Outlook
1.
Start Word.
2.
Choose Tools➪Options➪General. Then click
the E-Mail Options button in the lower-right
corner.
3.
Click the Personal Stationery tab.
Word shows you the Personal Stationery tab of
the E-mail Options dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 72-1.
• Figure 72-1: Set the default stationery using Word from
this deeply buried dialog box.

Technique 72: Building (And Stealing) E-mail Stationery
482
include some stationery that’s missing in Word’s
Theme or Stationery dialog box.
• Figure 72-3: Use the Stationery Picker to preview
stationery background and pictures.
2.
When you find stationery that you like,
click OK.
If you’re using Office 2003, don’t bother clicking
the Get More Stationery button. As this book went
to press, anyway, Microsoft had a dozen pieces of
stationery available for download from its Web
site, but none of the stationery will install unless
you have Office 2000 or Office XP. Microsoft will,
however, sell you additional pieces of stationery.
How nice. Look for the Office Personal Portfolio
add-on package at a store near you.
In Figure 72-4, I choose the Notebook stationery.
3.
Click OK to return to Outlook.
4.
Click the New button to compose a new e-mail
message.
If you specified one of the uninstalled pieces of
stationery as your default, Outlook shows you a
warning message. If you don’t get the warning,
you’re done. If you do, keep going.
4.
Click the Theme button.
Word shows you the Theme or Stationery dialog
box, as shown in Figure 72-2. This is a very
strange dialog box because it combines Word
Themes with some (but not all) built-in Outlook
stationery as well as stationery that you create
manually (see the last section in this Technique).
• Figure 72-2: A very odd mixture of options available for
default stationery.
5.
Under Choose a Theme, pick the stationery you
want for your default in Outlook.
6.
Click OK three times to return to Word.
That sets the default stationery for new e-mail
messages.
Setting up stationery in Outlook
To use a piece of existing stationery as the default
for new Outlook messages by using Outlook
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Mail Format. Click the
Stationery Picker button.
The Stationery Picker (see Figure 72-3) shows
you previews of some — but not all — of the sta-
tionery that ships with Outlook. It does, however,

Creating Your Own Stationery
483
• Figure 72-4: Pick the stationery you want to use for new
messages.
5.
Click Yes.
The Windows Installer kicks in. You might need
to supply your Office CD. When it’s done,
Outlook comes up with a new message, ready for
you to type.
To use a different stationery for one new mes-
sage, you don’t need to change the default.
Just go into Mail (Go➪Mail), choose
Actions➪New Mail Message Using➪More
Stationery, and choose the stationery that you
like.
Stealing Incoming Stationery
It’s very easy to, uh, recycle stationery from an
inbound message. You won’t get the text or any pic-
tures, but you do get the background, font settings,
and the like.
I can’t imagine that anyone would attempt to
copyright the background of e-mail stationery,
but stranger things have happened. If you
swipe stationery, make sure you aren’t taking
anything that’s owned by someone else, okay?
To make an inbound message’s stationery available
to your copy of Outlook
1.
Double-click the message to open it.
2.
Choose File➪Save Stationery.
Outlook shows you the Create New Stationery
dialog box (see Figure 72-5).
• Figure 72-5: Pilfering stationery is just that simple.
3.
Type a name for your new stationery and
click OK.
From that point on, the new stationery is available
in the same way as all the existing stationery: You
can make it the default or modify it at will. The
new stationery is even available from inside Word.
Creating Your Own Stationery
Creating your own stationery — either by starting
from scratch, or by modifying an existing sample —
isn’t difficult at all:

Technique 72: Building (And Stealing) E-mail Stationery

5.
If you want a simple signature at the bottom 
of each new message, you can type one in 
the Preview box.
Most people want to add a signature to their new
stationery — a blurb that appears at the bottom
of every message. Believe it or not, the worst
place to create an Outlook e-mail signature is in
Outlook. The best place is in Word.
6.
When you’re done, click OK twice.
Outlook sets your new stationery as the default
(refer to Figure 72-4).
• Figure 72-6: Pick a default font and choose between a
background picture and a background color.
1.
Choose Tools➪Options➪Mail Format and then
click the Stationery Picker button.
The Stationery Picker arrives (refer to Figure 72-3).
2.
Click New.
You see the Create New Stationery dialog box
(refer to Figure 72-5).
3.
Type a name for your new stationery, select the
radio button that reflects what you want to do,
and then click Next.
 Start with a Blank Stationery: This option
lets you supply font formatting and a back-
ground picture or color that’s applied uni-
formly on the stationery.
 Use This Existing Stationery As a Template:
As a starting point, Outlook pulls the font and
background from the stationery you specify.
 Use This File As a Template: As a starting
point, Outlook takes the font and background
from the HTML file that you pick.
Oddly, some of the built-in stationery (such as
Notebook) isn’t available for creating new sta-
tionery. On the other hand, stationery that you
pilfer is available both as a Use This Existing
Stationery as a Template choice, and in the Use
This File as a Template box.
Outlook brings up the Edit Stationery dialog box
(see Figure 72-6). You can change only the back-
ground picture or the background color — not
both.
4.
Change the default font, if you like.
