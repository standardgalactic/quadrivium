IS LIFE today better than it was
50 years ago? It depends on who
you ask. Nearly nine out of 10
Vietnamese people think so –
but only one in 10 Venezuelans.
About two-thirds of Germansand
Swedes say yes, but fewer than
half of Brits and only a third of
Americans agree. Worldwide,
an unhealthy majority – 57 per
cent – think quality of life has
deteriorated or stagnated.
These results come from a
survey of 43,000 people in
38 countries, published this
month by the Pew Research
Center in Washington DC.
The gloom is perhaps
surprising, given how much life
has been transformed by science,
technology and medicine since
1967. As the report notes, 50years
ago, many countries had yet to
experience the gains in health
and life expectancy brought 
about by vaccinations, green 
revolutions and so on. Technology
has dramatically boosted living 
standards too.
Why don’t people seem to 
notice, or care? In the words of Bill
Clinton, it’s the economy, stupid.
The single biggest influence that 
Pew identified was respondents’ 
sense of their own nation’s 
economicperformance. InSouth
Korea, India, Vietnam, Indonesia
and Turkey, which have enjoyed
big economic gains, solid
majorities say that life is better.
But when life is a struggle,
long and gradual improvements
in living standards are easy to
forget. The result is that one of
thegreatestupliftsinwell-being
in human history seems to be
widely taken for granted.
This is also a warning about
the future.Recently,wehaveseen
signs that the gains from science
and technology are slowing or
even reversing. Challenges like
climate change and antibiotic
resistance will make it harder
to make further improvements.
On top of that, our ability to 
address these issues is threatened
by a tsunami of anti-scientism, 
which has moved from denying 
scientific facts to crushing our 
ability to determine them at all.
The epicentre is, of course, 
Donald Trump’s White House. Its 
latest insult is apparently to ban 
officialsatthe Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention from
using the terms“evidence-based”
and“science-based”. Butitdoesn’t 
endthere.Turkey’sauthoritarian
regime continues to suppress
free exchange of ideas. India’s 
government is promoting 
research inspired by Hindu 
mythology – the health-giving 
propertiesofcow dung and urine, 
for example.
Scienceand scientists need to 
getbetterat reminding the world 
that they are a force for good – 
including that all-important 
prosperity.
After the initial vigour of the 
March for Science last April, 
attempts to defend science have 
fizzled out or returned to angry 
tweeting or academic letter-
writing. Such politesse is not 
enough in the face of determined 
and unscrupulous opposition.
Science has its weaknesses.
Not everyone will be or should  
be a cheerleader for it. But as we 
go into the new year, we could  
all begin by emphasising what 
science has done and can do for 
us. If we forget, and allow it to 
seem irrelevant or threatening, 
the next half-century really may 
be no better than the last. ■

the March for Science last 
April, attempts to defend 
reason have fizzled out”

A BABY born more than four
months before her due date has
become the youngest premature
baby to survive. The girl was born
after only 21 weeks and 5 days’
gestation, at Samsung Medical
Centre in Seoul, South Korea,
and is now a healthy 5-year-old.
In 2012, the girl’s 38-year-old
mother was rushed to hospital
because the membrane sac
encasing her unborn twins had
burst – a sign of impending
labour. She was told that her
twins, which had been conceived
by IVF, were extremely unlikely
to live, and that active life support
is usually only given to preterm
infants born at 25 weeks or later.
However, the woman and her
husband had a long history of
infertility issues and IVF failures
and urged their doctors to try to
support the twins. The doctors
agreed, and gave the mother
steroids to try to speed up the
development of the twins’lungs.
Intensive care
When she gave birth the next
day, the babies weighed just
under half a kilogram each, and
were 30 centimetres long. Most
full-terminfantsbornat40weeks
weighaboutseventimesasmuch,
and are 50 centimetres long.
The newborns were placed on
ventilators and fed via tubes into
their stomachs, because at only
12 days past the halfway mark of 
pregnancy they couldn’t breathe 
or swallow food on their own (see 
“Stages of development”, right). 
The male twin died two months 
later from an infection, but the 
female twin survived and was 
discharged from hospital six 
months after she had been born.
Since then, she has mostly 
developed normally. She is smaller
than other children her age, but 
has normal language, cognitive 
and social skills. She needs to wear
glasses, but she has no breathing 
problems or signs of physical 
disability (Journal of Korean 
Medical Science, doi.org/chdz).
Her good health may be due to 
the steroids she was given before 
she was born and her gender,  
says her doctor Yun Sil Chang of 
Samsung Medical Centre. Many 
previous studies have found that
premature babies are more likely
to survive when female, although 
the reasons for this are unclear.
The previous record for the 
youngest surviving premature
infant was a girl born in the US
at 21 weeks and 6 days’ gestation. 
She was also conceived via IVF.
Last month, Kaashif Ahmad  
at Baylor College of Medicine  
in Texas reported the case of a 
2-year-oldgirlwhowassurviving
well after being born at about
21 weeks and 4 days’ gestation. 
However, her exact gestational 
age at birth couldn’t be 
determined because she was 
conceived naturally, not by IVF. 
The estimate was based on  
her mother’s last period and 
ultrasound dating, which has an
errormarginofaboutfivedays.
NicholasEvansatRoyalPrince
Alfred Hospital in Sydney,
Australia, says these cases
highlight how far neonatal care
has advanced in recent decades.
When he started training as a
neonatologistinthe1970s,babies
born between 30 and 34 weeks
often didn’t survive, he says.
“Now they mostly sail through
without any problems.”
Big improvements were
initially made with the
introduction of mechanical
ventilatorsandgivingthemother
steroidsduring labour.The use
of lung surfactant has helped
premature babies breathe using
their slightly stiffer lungs.
More recently, additional
improvements have been made
by disconnecting babies from
ventilators and IV nutrition lines
as soon as possible, to prevent
lung damage and reduce the risk
of infection. Doctors have also
found that waiting a minute to
clamp the umbilical cord seems
to improve health. This may be 
because it allows more blood  
and immune cells to flow into  
the baby from the placenta.
However, babies that survive 
extremely premature birth  
can create false hope for other 
parents, says Evans. Only 23 per 
cent of babies born at 22 weeks 
who receive intensive care 
survive, and there is not enough 
data to know what the overall 
chances of survival for a baby 
born at 21 weeks, like the Korean 
girl, are (see graph, right).
Of the very premature babies
that survive, about one-third end 
up having severe neurological 
issues. “There’s no doubt that 
survival rates are improving  
for these extremely premature
babies, but the disability rates
are still quite high,” says Evans. 
“Their brain is still a rudimentary 
structure, their lungs haven’t 
properly developed yet, and they 
have no defence mechanisms

STAGES OF 
DEVELOPMENT
If a baby is born prematurely, it 
might not yet have reached key 
milestones of development.
WEEKS 1 TO 12 
Basic structures of organs, limbs, 
eyes, nose, lips, ears, fingernails  
and genitals start to form.
WEEKS 14 TO 18 
Toenails, taste buds, hair follicles 
and sweat glands form. Lung 
airways develop fine branches, and 
ear canal becomes fully formed.
WEEKS 20 TO 24
 Mammary glands form. Grooves 
appear on brain surface and start 
to fold. Lung alveoli begin to form, 
allowing gas exchanges with 
bloodstream.
WEEKS 28 TO 40 
Organs continue to grow. The brain 
undergoes complex folding, testes 
descend, and eye lenses develop. 

scene.Thatwayadirector-pilot gets 
three shots for the price of one.  
“Right now, flying drones by 
pilots is quite tricky,” says Quentin 
Galvane at Inria. Rarely do drone 
pilots film actors at close range 
as they are worried about losing 
control, but automating the process 
changes that.
Although drones are noisy,  
which is potentially problematic  
when filming scenes with dialogue, 
Galvane says that for action
sequences, film-makers often
rerecord audio in the studio later
anyway. Technicolor hopes to
demonstrate the system to movie-
making clients in the near future.
“I think it’s great, it makes
absolute sense,” says Jim Scanlan
at the University of Southampton.
He uses drones and optical sensors
for organisations that map scenery, 
who could also benefit from this  
kind of automation. “For instance, 
automatically following landscapes 
and terrain without the tedium of 
putting in a detailed flight plan.”

LIGHTS, drone swarm, action! In the
future, movies may not be shot by 
lumbering cameras on rails, but by 
drones that automatically fly around  
a scene, grabbing the best possible 
angles without the need for human 
intervention.
One project that aims to make this 
happen is by cinematography firm 
Technicolor and the French Institute 
for Research in Computer Science  
and Automation (Inria). In recent 
experiments, the team began by
scanning a mock film set in 3D using
infrared sensors. This data was then
fed to algorithms that told the drones
thepositionofanyobstacles.Physical
markers on the actors, which can be
edited out later, allowed the drones
to visually recognise when they had
performers in their sights.
The director could then simply
drawarouteforthedronestofollow
on a digital map of the set. They
are smart enough so that if the
path sketched out by the director
accidentally conflicts with an
obstacleoractortheyautomatically
adjust their route, keeping a safe 
distance to avoid crashing.
Another option the team is working 
on involves programming two “slave” 
drones to automatically position 
themselves near to a “master” drone 
to get multiple angles of the same 
against infection, so it’s 
challenging to nurse them 
through that.”
Most premature babies in 
Australia, the UK and US now 
receive active support if they are 
born at 25 weeks or later, while 
decisions about those born at  
23 to 24 weeks are made on a  
case-by-case basis. Few neonatal
units offer interventions for
babies born at 22 weeks or less.

The increasing survival of
very premature babies may  
have implications for abortion 
laws, which have time limits to 
prevent the termination of fetuses
that would be capable of living
outsidethewomb.IntheUKand
parts of Australia and the US,
abortionsarelegalupto24weeks,
which has been considered the
threshold of viability.
In June, the British Medical
Association reaffirmed its
support for this cut-off.“It is
the BMA’s view, based on the 
peer-reviewed published UK  
data, that there is no evidence of 
significant improvements in the 
survival of extremely preterm
infants to support reducing
the24weektimelimitforlegal
abortion on this basis,”it
wrote in a position paper.
However, Evans thinks this
may change. “I think many 
neonatologists would now say
that 24 weeks is a bit high and
20 weeks would probably be a
better cut-off,”he says.“But it
is a difficult ethical thing.”  ■

launched to a nearby exoplanet
to look for life.
The project is so new it doesn’t
have a name – and most of the 
technology it needs doesn’t exist
yet. But there’s plenty of time to 
work out the kinks before 2069. 
“It’s very nebulous,” says 
Anthony Freeman at JPL, who 
presentedthemissionconceptat
the 2017 American Geophysical
UnionconferenceinNewOrleans,
Louisiana, on 12 December.

reach at least 10 per cent of the
speed of light by 2069. It also
directed the agency to launch
a mission to Alpha Centauri,
the nearest star system to ours.
The JPL group has drafted
science goals for the mission,
including studying the make-up
of the matter and radiation it
encounters, and testing general
relativity on the way. Upon 
arrival, the probe should make 
observations of the planetary 
system, plus the atmosphere and 
landscape of the target exoplanet. 
A few years after the launch, 
NASA would send a large telescope 
to deep space. There, it would 
position itself so that light from 
Alpha Centauri grazes our sun, 
meaning gravitational lensing can 
giveusafullviewoftheexoplanet.
The probe’s primary goal will
be to determine whether life is 
present. After all, the telescope 
could confirm virtually 
everything else. 
“We’ll be able to characterise
the atmosphere. We’ll be able to
see the planet, assuming it’s not
coveredinclouds,”saysJPL’sStacy
Weinstein-Weiss, lead author of
the paper outlining the concept.
Techniques to detect life once in
orbit include looking for artificial
structures, lights going on and off,
and large-scale land modification.
The target might not be Alpha
Centauri, depending on who you
ask – the group has identified
other sun-like stars close enough
to visit. Wherever is chosen, one
big hurdle is that no technology
we have can get a craft to a decent
fraction of the speed of light.
What’s more, entering orbit
upon arrival would add decades
to the mission, says Avi Loeb at
Harvard University, who is part
of the interstellar Breakthrough
Starshot initiative.“This requires
braking and a low travel speed for
the spacecraft, much less than a
tenth of the speed of light, which
implies a trip time of centuries or
more,”says Loeb.
The JPL team is exploring ways
to power a spaceship travelling
at10percentthespeedoflight–
including antimatter-matter
collisions, nuclear propulsion,
and even laser-powered light sails
like those Breakthrough Starshot
will use, which the team says are
most promising.
Of course, there’s no guarantee
this spaceship will ever leave the
drawing board. But if it does gain
steam, it could even give us better
ways of getting around our own
solar system. ■

Carolyn Elya at the University of
California, Berkeley, has observed this
kind of fungus infecting fruit flies in
Zombie fungus

flies’ brains
her back garden. Getting it to attack 
fruit flies in the lab allowed her team 
to learn more about how parasitic 
fungi operate, because fruit flies are 
so well studied – they are used in labs 
around the world.
The fungus, called Entomophthora 
muscae, kills fruit flies in four to seven 
days, Elya’s team has found. The 
animals appear to behave normally 
until the final day, when their gait 
becomes shaky and they won’t fly 
even if prodded.
Instead, they start heading up any 
vertical object and soon stop walking 
altogether. The flies then extend  
their proboscis and use it to “glue” 
themselves to whatever surface they 
are on. Over the next 10 minutes, 
they slowly spread their wings in  
little bursts. Then, a few hours before 
sunset, they die in a characteristic 
pose. It was this pose that drew 
Elya’s attention to the infected wild 
flies in her backyard. After the flies 
die, the fungus starts sprouting 
from their bodies. 
Five hours after sunset, the fungus 
starts to launch tiny, sticky spores at 
high speeds – 9 metres a second – over 
several centimetres (bioRxiv, DOI: 
10.1101/232140). 
Elya has found that the fungus 
invades the nervous system very  
early on, appearing first in the brain 
after around 48 hours. She thinks the 
fungus alters behaviour by releasing 
chemicals directly into the brain. 
“It’s really cool just to work out  
what’s going on, but we may also  
learn general principles about how  
it changes behaviour,” says Elya.

WE FIRST discovered the laws of
gravity, and then those of
quantum mechanics. But new
work suggests nature might go
about it the other way around:
space-time, and hence gravity,
couldemergefromafundamental
quantummechanicaldescription
of the universe.
According to Einstein’s general
relativity, gravity is the curvature
ofspace-time.Thatthisgeometry
mightberelatedtotheminuscule
quantum world was first
understood in the 1970s when
Stephen Hawking and Jacob
Bekenstein showed that the
entropy of a black hole – which
depends on the black hole’s
microscopicquantumstructure– 
is proportional to its surface area.
While at Harvard University in 
the late 1990s, Juan Maldacena 
discovered a connection between 
a theory of gravity that describes  
a volume of space and a quantum 
field theory that describes the 
volume’s surface, and doesn’t 
include gravity. Since then,  
others have used Maldacena’s 
conjecture to show that the area
of certain surfaces within such a
volume is related to the amount  
of quantum entanglement 
between different regions in  
the quantum field theory. Two 
regions are entangled if the  
state of one cannot be described 
independently of the other.
In this model, changing the 
amount of entanglement between 
different surface regions can 
create or destroy space-time in 
the volume, suggesting that it 
emerges from entanglement. 
There is one catch: this space-time 
is not quite the same as the space-
time of our universe.
Now, ChunJun Cao and Sean 
Carroll at the California Institute 
of Technology in Pasadena have 
tried to extract the kind of space-
time we would find in the vicinity 
of our solar system from standard 
quantum mechanics. This type  
of space-time is one whose 
curvature is mostly flat, but with 
small undulations due to weak 
gravitational fields.
To see if space-time can emerge 
from this quantum description, 
Cao and Carroll used an abstract 
mathematical concept called 
Hilbert space that can be split  
into different tiny parts, such  
that each one corresponds to a 
single point in 3D space. “There  
is entanglement between these 
little parts,” says Carroll. “A lot  
of entanglement between some, 
and very little between others.”
The researchers relate 
entanglement to geometry by 
further assuming that the greater 
the entanglement between two 
parts, the closer they are.
The entire system is also 
assumed to be in some state of 
equilibrium, such that increasing 
the entanglement in one region 
decreases it elsewhere, and vice 
versa. Given a handful of such 
assumptions, Cao and Carroll 
have shown that the equations 
governing the dynamics of 
entanglement are similar  
to Einstein’s equations of  
general relativity (arxiv.org/
abs/1712.02803). In other words, 
space-time and gravity emerge 
from entanglement.
Bartlomiej Czech at Princeton 
University, who researches 
emergent space-time in the 
context of Maldacena’s 
conjecture, says the work is 
“excellent”. But the assumptions 
must be validated. “To construct 
an actual system that satisfies 
these assumptions is going to  
be difficult, but it’s also very 
exciting,” he says.  ■

“Female monkeys often
rubbed themselves on the
backs of deer and made
calls like when on heat”
IT’S a kind of monkeying around.
Adolescent female monkeys mount
deer and rub themselves on their
backs, apparently to practise sex
when they are still too young to be 
chosen by adult males.
Earlier this year, biologists reported
observations of a male Japanese 
macaque mounting sika deer and 
trying to mate. Now female macaques
Young female 
monkeys get 
frisky with deer
have been seen mounting these
deer in Minoo, Japan. Noëlle Gunst
and colleagues at the University
of Lethbridge, Canada, recorded
five adolescent female macaques
mounting deer a total of 258 times
in a two-month period (Archives of
Sexual Behaviour, doi.org/chht).
Adolescent females in this species 
of monkey are sometimes seen 
mounting other females or males and 
soliciting for sex. These encounters, 
known as consortships, are thought to 
be a way to practise and develop adult 
sexual behaviours. Gunst even claims 
they allow the female monkeys to 
experience sexual reward through 
genital stimulation.
The deer-mounting behaviour is 
related, Gunst believes. It has only 
been seen during the mating season 
and is similar to consortships between 
monkeys. Female monkeys often 
rubbed their genitals on the back of 
the deer and would also gaze at them 
and emit high-pitched vocalisations, 
like their typical calls when on heat. 
When deer walked away, the 
female monkeys sometimes displayed 
what Gunst calls “sexually motivated 
tantrums”, consisting of body spasms 
and screaming. 
“It is well known that a period of 
maturation and practice is necessary 
for the development of adult-like 
sexual behaviours and sexual partner 
preferences in non-human primates,” 
Gunst says. Adolescent females are 
not the preferred partners of adult 
male monkeys, so tend to be rejected. 
Deer-mounting may act “as an outlet 
for sexual frustration”, says Gunst.

RESEMBLING claw marks made by
some giant space bird, peculiar 
parallel tracks on Saturn’s moons 
Dione and Rhea are proving baffling.
“I feel like I’m going crazy trying to 
come up with an explanation,” says 
Emily Martin at the National Air and 
Space Museum in Washington DC.
A few streaks had been spotted 
before but not systematically charted. 
Martin’s team did so using data from 
NASA’s Cassini probe, and named them 
linear virgae. Their brightness and the 
way they lie on the landscape suggest 
they are relatively young, perhaps no 
more than a billion years old. 
The team considered various 
explanations for the lines. They might 
be an unknown type of fault or crack, 
but they neither disrupt the terrain 
nor cast a shadow, almost as if they 
were painted on. Rolling boulders 
produce long, linear grooves on Mars’s 
moon Phobos. However, these are 
typically shorter than the virgae and 
are known to cast shadows.
Could they be from comet and 
asteroid hits? The virgae look a lot  
like crater rays, which radiate from an 
impact in straight lines. But they fail  
to converge on any craters. On Dione, 
most appear to be in the same 
orientation, running east and west 
above and below the equator.
Maybe the little moons had ring 
systems that crashed down. But 
collapsing ring particles should all 
land near the equator where rings 
generally orbit, whereas the streaks 
on Dione stretch far to the north and 
south of it. On Rhea, whose surface  
is poorly mapped, the known linear 
virgae seem to cluster in a single 
eastern region near the equator.
“I’m not sure what to make of it,” 
says Amanda Hendrix at the Planetary 
Science Institute in Arizona. Perhaps 
a strange mixture of processes could 
account for the streaks, she says. 
Martin presented her team’s work 
at the 2017 American Geophysical 
Union meeting last week in New 
Orleans, Louisiana.  Adam Mann  ■

DEEP beneath the mosaic floor
of Venice’s St Mark’s Basilica,
archaeologists have found two
1300-year-old peach stones.
They add at least 100 years to
the city’s history.
Most of Italy’s great cities
date back to the Romans, but not
Venice, says Albert Ammerman
at Colgate University in Hamilton,
New York. There were Romans on
Torcello island in the north of the
Venetian lagoon, but there are no
Roman remains in Venice.
Instead, the city’s history seems
to begin in the 9th century. Local
tradition says the bones of Saint
Mark the Evangelist were carried
to Venice in AD 828 from Egypt.
The earliest basilica named in his
honour was built a few years later.
Ammerman and his colleagues
think they have evidence for an
earlier chapter of the Venetian
story. In a sediment core taken
from under the modern basilica –
built in the 11th century – they
found two peach stones.“This was
like hitting the jackpot,”says
Ammerman. Peach stones are
ideal for carbon dating, because
they grow in a single year and
contain lots of carbon.
Both stones dated to between
AD 650 and 770 – up to 180 years
older than the earliest basilica.
A bit of elm charcoal found in
the same core was a similar age
(Antiquity, doi.org/chf2).
That fits a study Ammerman
published in 1995, in which his
team found glass and mortar
that they were able to date to the
7th and 8th centuries in sediment
cores taken near the basilica.
The new finds give a sense of
what people were doing in the
area at this time. The peach stones
were almost 4.2 metres below the
modern ground surface. Using
data on historic sea levels, the
team calculates that they were
deposited a metre or more below
sea level in the 8th century. This
implies that they were tossed into
thenaturalcanalsthatranthrough
the Venice lagoon before the city
was built, says Ammerman.
The peach stones may have been
dropped in the lagoon by people,
agrees Laura Sadori at the
Sapienza University of Rome.
What’s more, bits of ceramics
and metal were found in the
same layer of sediment. This
layer is clearly human-made,
says Ammerman, and it is 80
centimetres thick in some places.
Ammerman thinks the core is
evidence that people were filling
the natural waterways in the
lagoon, to create the dry land on
which Venice was built from the
9th century onwards.
It makes sense people were in
the area early, says Nick Marriner
at the University of Franche-
Comté in Besançon, France. We
“have been living in and around
lagoonal areas for thousands of
years, because they are hotspots
of biodiversity, rich in resources
and afford natural protection
from the sea”, he says.
“There seems to be sufficient
evidence for a human presence
in the area in the 7th and the
8th century,” says art historian 
Wolfgang Wolters.  ■

THE surgeon was poised to carry
out a skin graft when he decided
to try out an experimental device
to check for infection. Called the
MolecuLight i:X, it shows the
presence of bacteria in real time
as an eerie fluorescent glow.
The patient was a 47-year-old 
man whose leg had been 
amputated above the knee.  
He had endured one infection 
already and the surgeon didn’t 
want to risk another. 
“I was ready to perform surgery
on this patient. The wound looked
clean,”says Steven Jeffery of
the Royal Centre for Defence
Medicine in Birmingham, UK.
One look through the machine,
however, and the operation was
called off. The wound glowed red
at the edge, showing it was riddled
with bacteria that would probably
have caused the skin graft to fail.
When the wound was swabbed
and tested in the lab it confirmed
that harmful bacteria were
present. The skin graft was
delayed until the wound had
healed, which Jeffery says led
to a better outcome. Using the 
device “completely changed  
my decision-making”, he says.
Wound infections are a big 
problem in medicine. Swabs  
can be taken and sent to a lab for 
testing but this takes days, which 
can delay treatment. On the spot, 
doctors can only inspect the 
wound, touch it to see if it is too 
warm, or even sniff it. But they 
don’t want to use antibiotics 
unnecessarily as this can cause 
side effects and lead to drug 
resistance. And sometimes there
are no early signs of infection.
Launched in October, the
MolecuLight i:X is a little larger
than a smartphone. It emits
light at a wavelength of 405
nanometres – perfect to spot
bacteria, which have molecules
called porphyrins that fluoresce at
this wavelength. When held over a
patient’s wound, the screen shows
it augmented with glowing red
where thereare certain bacteria,or
in the case of one type, blue-green.
Apart from the blue-green
species, it doesn’t distinguish
between different types of
bacteria, nor does it indicate
their quantity.
Swabs may still need to be
tested but the device shows
where they should be taken,
says Rosemary Hill of Lions Gate
Hospital in Vancouver, who has
been field-testing it. Wounds are
usually swabbed from the centre
but the MolecuLight i:X has
been showing that bacteria may
be present only around the edges.
“The presence of bacteria does
not mean the existence of active
infection,”says Ewen Harrison at
the University of Edinburgh,
who isn’t involved in the research.
Two small trials have linked the
device with faster wound healing
partly by showing where wounds
should be swabbed, although
neither were randomised. ■

“The pain goes away very
quickly. Letizia broke her
shoulder skiing, but carried
on and then drove home”
AN ITALIAN family that barely
senses pain has had the genetic root
of their shared disorder uncovered.
Understanding this gene may lead
to new painkillers.
The affected family members
include a 78-year-old woman,
her two daughters and their three
children. All of them fail to sense
pain the way most of us do, and don’t
notice when they injure themselves.
When they were assessed, the
individuals were found to have
The peculiar 
family who 
don’t feel pain
fractures in their arms and legs that 
they hadn’t realised were there.
“Sometimes they feel pain in the 
initial break, but it goes away very 
quickly,” says James Cox of University 
College London. “For example, Letizia 
broke her shoulder while skiing, but 
then kept skiing for the rest of the 
day and drove home. She didn’t get  
it checked out until the next day.”
To find the cause of this lack of pain 
sensitivity, Cox and his colleagues 
performed a series of tests. The team 
found that all six family members had 
a typical number of nerves in their 
skin, but that they all had a mutation 
in a gene called ZFHX2.
When the team deleted this gene 
in mice, they discovered that the 
animals were not as good at sensing 
when painful pressure was applied 
to their tails, but they were 
hypersensitive to heat sensations. 
This suggests the gene may play a  
role in controlling whether stimuli  
are painful or not.
The team then gave mice the same 
mutated version of the gene that the 
Italian family have. These mice were 
much less sensitive to painful levels  
of heat. The mutation seems to have 
this effect because the gene normally 
controls the activity of 16 other 
genes, some of which are involved in 
sensing pain (Brain, DOI: 10.1093/
brain/awx236).
Cox and his colleagues hope to 
work out exactly how these genes 
contribute to the reduced sensation of 
pain. This might allow them to develop 
drugs that achieve the same effect. 
Such drugs could benefit people in 
chronic pain, who often struggle to 
find relief with existing treatments.
It may also be possible to develop 
a treatment to reverse the family’s 
insensitivity to pain. But team 
member John Wood, also at University 
College London, says the family don’t 
want that. “I asked them if they would 
like to normally sense pain and they 
said no.”  Jessica Hamzelou  ■

THERE’S a new use for sperm –
delivering cancer drugs.
Standard chemotherapy is toxic 
to both cancer cells and normal 
cells, leading to symptoms like 
nausea, and limiting the dose a 
person can receive.
But if chemotherapy drugs 
specifically targeted tumours,  
we could avoid this. Haifeng Xu  
at the Leibniz Institute for Solid 
State and Materials Research in 
Germany and his team are
experimenting with using sperm 
cells to take drugs to cancers in 
the female reproductive tract.
When they loaded sperm cells 
with doxorubicin, a common 
chemo agent, and released them 
in a dish containing mini cervical 
cancer tumours, the sperm swam 
towards the tumours, killing 87 
per cent of their cells within three 
days (ACS Nano, doi.org/gcm4wq).
The team then fitted sperm
with tiny four-armed magnetic
harnesses that allowed them to
be guided by magnets. When  
the sperm hit a solid tumour,  
the arms sprung open, releasing 
the sperm and allowing them to 
swim into the tumour.
As well as cancer, spermbots 
might be useful for treating other
conditions affecting the female 
reproductive tract such as 
endometriosis or ectopic 
pregnancies, says Xu.

That’s the way to do it! Kids 
pay to see justice done
CHILDREN as young as 6 want to see wrongdoers 
punished, it turns out.
Nikolaus Steinbeis of the Max Planck Institute for 
Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, 
and his team carried out a series of tests involving 
72 children. Each of them watched Punch and Judy  
shows in which one puppet shared a toy with the child, 
while a second, nastier puppet taunted them instead.
Then a third puppet would appear and randomly hit 
either of the two other puppets. After a few seconds,  
a curtain covered the action, but children could choose to 
“pay” with prized stickers to continue watching.
On average, 6-year-olds were willing to spend twice  
as much to see the bad puppet beaten than the generous 
one punished. This age seems to be a critical – at 4 or 5, 
children showed no appetite for revenge. 
“This study tells us that children have a motivation  
to see deserved punishment enacted,” says Steinbeis.
In a similar experiment with 17 chimps, the animals 
were either handed or denied food by a person, who  
was then “beaten” from behind by another human.  
To continue watching, the chimps had to push back a 
heavy door. Half the chimps made the effort to see the 
food-denier beaten, but only 19 per cent of them wanted 
to see the person who’d fed them take a beating (Nature 
Human Behaviour, DOI: 10.1038/s41562-01700264-5).

A plesiosaur that 
swam in the Triassic
THE long-necked marine reptiles 
known as plesiosaurs are icons of 
the dinosaur age. Now the oldest 
plesiosaur ever found is shedding 
light on their origins.
The fossil dates from the first 
dinosaur period, the Triassic. It 
shows that plesiosaurs evolved in 
the late Triassic and survived the 
mass extinction that ushered in 
the Jurassic 200 million years ago.
The 2-metre-long fossil may be 
a juvenile. It was found in 2013 in a 
clay pit in Germany and acquired 
by a private collector, who told
authorities. Now Martin Sander
at the University of Bonn and his 
colleagues have confirmed it as
the first known Triassic plesiosaur
(Science Advances, doi.org/chdp).
“Very early in the Jurassic there 
are lots and lots of plesiosaurs, as 
if they appeared from nowhere,” 
says Roger Benson of the 
University of Oxford. “So 
everyone was expecting to find  
a plesiosaur from the Triassic.”
TB, or not TB? The 
answer is in pee
A URINE test for tuberculosis 
could make it much easier to 
identify the disease before it kills.
TB is currently diagnosed using 
a skin test, or by culturing bacteria 
from a person’s sputum. Both 
methods take days to give results.
Now Alessandra Luchini of 
George Mason University in 
Virginia and her team have 
developed a urine test for TB that 
gives results in 12 hours. It detects 
a certain sugar that coats the 
surface of TB bacteria.
The test uses tiny molecular 
cages embedded with a dye that 
can catch and trap these sugar 
molecules, even at low levels.
In tests, the technique correctly 
identified 48 people with TB 
(Science Translational Medicine, 
doi.org/chdm).

Pac-Man maze haunted by “ghosts”
programmed to chase down robots.
The set-up simulated how the
robots could be guided by an
algorithm, as they would need to
be to work inside the human body
(PloS One, doi.org/chhw).
The team also tested the robots’
grip – they had to grab a chunk of
mozzarella cheese with pincers
that closed on the application of a
magnet. Some of the designs that
had six pincers were good at cutting
mini pieces of cheese, suggesting
they might be handy when cutting
out tissue, for example.
“In the long term we feel such
miniaturised grippers could be used
as micro-robots for applications
within minimally invasive surgery,
such as taking biopsies,” says Misra.
Grossed-outgreattitssteerevolution
GREAT tits that show disgust when
they eat a horrible meal may be
driving their prey to evolve.
Manypreyanimalshavedeterrents
against predators, like poison. Some
signal this with conspicuous colours.
It’s unclear how such signals came
about. “Predators need to first learn
the signal before they avoid it, but
until they do, these prey are easy to
detect and kill,” says Rose Thorogood
at the University of Cambridge.
If predators learn by watching other’s
errors, however, this might protect
the prey population long enough for
it to reproduce and evolve.
Her team gave great tits a new
“prey”: almonds, some dosed with
a chemical they dislike. The almonds
were in envelopes, marked if they
held a bad one. Some tits watched
a bird eat a bad almond. It spat it out,
then wiped its beak: a sign of disgust.
All birds learned to avoid the bad
almonds through trial and error, but
“trained” birds ate fewer (Nature
Ecology & Evolution, DOI: 10.1038/
s41559-017-0418-x).
“The conspicuous ‘prey’ were
40 per cent more likely to survive
when predators were socially
informed,” says Thorogood.
OUR solar system’s twin has been
discovered more than 2500 light
years away. In data from the
Kepler space telescope, an eighth
planet has been spotted in the
Kepler-90 system, tying our own
system for the highest number
of known planets.
Christopher Shallue of Google
and Andrew Vanderburg at the
University of Texas at Austin
used a neural network – a type of
machine learning that mimics the
connections in a brain – to look
for new planets in old Kepler data.
They trained their algorithm on
15,000 signals that scientists
had already examined and either
labelled as real exoplanets or not.
When it was applied to a set of
Kepler signals from 670 stars, the
algorithm found two new planets
(arxiv.org/abs/1712.05044). One,
called Kepler-80g, orbits a star
about 1100 light years away that
was already known to have five
planets. The other discovery,
Kepler-90i, is the eighth planet
in its system. It appears to be
small and rocky, and probably
is without a thick atmosphere.
Because it orbits near its star, this
world’s surface may reach
temperatures as high as 425°C.
All the planets around the star
Kepler-90 orbit closer than Earth
does to the sun. Closest in are two
planets slightly larger than our
own, then Kepler-90i, which is the
system’s smallest planet, followed
by three worlds a bit smaller
than Neptune and two gas giants.
Kepler has only searched the area
near to the star, so there may be
more planets further out.
Our solar system might not
hold the record for the most
number of planets for long.

IN BRIEF

T
HE world faces a challenge. As the
population grows, our choices about
what to eat along with climate change,
desertification and loss of biodiversity are all
affecting access to safe and nutritious food in
sufficient quantities.
As one of the world’s largest
agribusinesses, Syngenta is committed to
addressing these challenges. We believe that
innovation is critical for sustainable food
production and for supporting the millions of
people who produce food. Our goal is to find
ways to feed more mouths using the same
land more efficiently.
Syngenta has invested heavily to achieve
this goal. Each year, we invest over
USD 1.4 billion in Research and Development
and we have more than 5000 scientists at
research labs across the globe. The R&D
team has created one of the strongest
product pipelines in the industry, and every
product needs to be both effective and safe.
That’s where our Product Safety centre of
excellence comes in. Based at Jealott’s Hill in
the UK, the Global Product Safety team
ensures that products are safe for people and
the environment. The team ensures that
these products comply with rigorous  
internal standards as well as meeting the 
high external regulatory standards set by 
organisations such as the European Union. 
“We have a world-class Product Safety 
department,” says Steve Maund, Head of 
Global Product Safety at Syngenta.
This team is now expanding. At Syngenta, 
we are looking for talented scientists with an 
innovative approach to problem solving and 
the ability to communicate with both expert 
and non-expert audiences. “We want to tap 
into a global talent pool,” says Maund. “You 
may not currently work in a Product Safety 
role but if you have a mix of passion, 
creativity, imagination and good scientific 
practice, we want to speak to you.” 
New recruits will join a supremely capable 
and experienced team. Peter Campbell, a 
senior environmental specialist at Syngenta, 
says the work will appeal to those who share 
the company’s goals of promoting 
biodiversity and sustainability. “We have 
chemists, biologists and toxicologists all 
working together,” says Campbell, who 
headed the ecotoxicology branch of the UK 
pesticide regulatory agency before joining 
The world needs a safe and sustainable supply of food. That’s why Syngenta

Our work matters
Syngenta. “I decided to join Syngenta 
because I had always been impressed by 
both the quality of the science submitted,  
and the quality of the scientists I met.” 
The team has members with different 
backgrounds. Miriam Daniels is a biologist 
whose previous work focused on 
understanding the uptake, movement and 
metabolism of Syngenta’s novel plant 
protection products to optimise their 
biological activity. Her new role in Product 
Safety offered a different challenge. “I had 
become increasingly aware of the challenge 
to optimise biological activity while also 
ensuring that our new products are safe and 
can be registered for use,” she says. “While  
I am developing technically, I can still utilise 
my skills from my previous roles.”
It is this kind of diverse team that Syngenta 
believes can drive innovation to help farmers 
feed the world sustainably. “As we rise to the 
challenges of providing a safe and 
sustainable food supply, our expanding 
Product Safety teams have an important role 
to play,” says Maund. “Come and join us.”

F
ROM a distance, it seems like a tray
of pink jellies. But look more closely
and you will see 12 pieces of skin,
stretched across small wells, ready to be
covered in mascara, lipstick and other
cosmetics or chemicals.
For four decades, scientists at the French
cosmetics company L’Oréal have pioneered
the development of this lab-grown human
skin. EpiSkin, as it is known, is such a good
model of the real thing that it has helped lead
the way in ending animal testing.
“L’Oréal stopped testing finished products
on animals in 1989,” says Estelle Tinois-
Tessonneaud, who did some of the early
EpiSkin research and now oversees safety
and communications at the company. “It was
the first company in the world to do this.”
EpiSkin hasn’t just revolutionised the
way ingredients are tested in the cosmetics
industry; EPISKIN, a subsidiary of L’Oréal,
sells batches to other cosmetics companies,
to chemical and pharmaceutical industries, 
and to university-based scientists. 
The research it supports has brought 
insights into how our own skin functions and 
ages. That’s because EpiSkin is actually 
made from human cells. “It’s not artificial 
skin,” says Tinois-Tessonneaud, who has a 
PhD in skin biology.“These are real, living 
cells.” They come from discarded skin tissue, 
donated by people undergoing 
reconstructive breast surgery, for example. 
Skin technology
The team at EPISKIN carefully isolates cells 
from the epidermis – the top layer of skin – 
before arranging them onto a matrix layer. 
The researchers then place these cell patches 
in lab dishes and bathe them in a fluid 
containing water, sugar and amino acids, as 
well as a host of other ingredients that give it 
a pinkish hue. This fluid mimics the function

testing and giving researchers unprecedented insight into the

of blood and keeps the cells alive. Within a 
few weeks, a structure resembling human 
skin forms in the dish.
Like the real thing, the epidermis-in-a-dish 
is made up of four layers, each of which has 
cells of a different shape. At the surface is the 
horny layer, comprised of flattened dead 
cells. This top layer of the EpiSkin is dry, which 
makes it easy for researchers to apply 
chemicals and measure how the cells react.
Underneath this is the granular layer, where 
lipids are produced. Lower again is the 
spinous layer that contains a variety of lipids, 
as well as immune cells and enzymes. The 
basal layer sits at the bottom of the stack. 
EpiSkin reproduces the distinctive shape of 
the cells in each layer.
Having these tissues gives laboratories a 
fuller picture of how skin reacts to different 
substances and allows them to better select 
the product to be tested in clinical studies. For 
example, if a cosmetics team is working out

MATRIX LAYER
The skin cells are placed 
on a matrix and bathed 
in nutrients
Initially, the cells grow 
horizontally, forming a monolayer 
that covers the matrix
The cells are then exposed to air. 
This causes them to stratify into 
layers similar to those in skin tissue

Tessonneaud. Together, the fibroblasts –
which help maintain structure and elasticity –
and the collagen make a dermis-like gel,
which the epidermis can sit on top of.
We know that when sunlight penetrates
the dermis, it kills fibroblasts, and this is
thought to contribute to ageing. Indeed,
when the EPISKIN team expose their full-
thickness skin to ultraviolet light, fibroblasts
disappear. Because of this, the model allows
the team to test anti-ageing treatments. If a
cosmetic prevents the fibroblasts dying, it is
then tested in clinical studies.
The full thickness skin model helped
L’Oréal develop an anti-ageing ingredient 
called Pro-Xylane, which is now used in many 
of the company’s products, such as 
moisturisers and face masks. Tests on 
EpiSkin show that Pro-Xylane boosts 
collagen production, and follow up studies in 
women have found that it smooths the 
appearance of wrinkles.
Another of the EpiSkin models was created 
to help develop better sunscreens and 
whitenings. The cells in this model can burn 
when exposed to ultraviolet light. This allows 
the team to test potential sunscreen formulas 
and whether they prevent this happening.
These cells also contain melanin, which is 
responsible for brown spots associated with 
ageing. Age spots are thought to result from 
an over-production of melanin, and EpiSkin is 
helping to reveal compounds that can 
diminish their appearance.
The range of models doesn’t stop at skin. 
The EPISKIN team and L’Oréal researchers 
have developed and grown a model of the 
human cornea to test if products cause eye 
irritation, for example. Using other donated 
skin types, the team has created a model of 
human gums, the inside of the mouth and 
even the lining of the vagina, which makes it 
possible to test female hygiene products.
Beyond the cosmetics industry, EpiSkin is 
improving our understanding of skin 
disorders, says Tinois-Tessonneaud. 
Nowadays, researchers are using skin 
models to study diseases that cause people 
to be extremely sensitive to sunlight, which 
can put them at risk of developing cancers. 
This research is already aiding the 
development of promising gene therapies.
Researchers at L’Oréal and EPISKIN now 
plan to expand the EpiSkin range even 
further. Models that mimic dry skin, inflamed 
skin or sensitive skin could give researchers a 
better understanding of these complaints 
and highlight ways to develop new and 
improved treatments.
“We are also developing new tissue 
models that integrate the latest advances 
such as tissue reconstruction using 
functionalised cells,” says Jean-Marc 
Ovigne, head of R&D at EPISKIN.
The hope is to offer an alternative to animal 
testing across industry and academia all over 
the world. “This is really what L’Oréal has 
been doing for the last 30 years,” says Tinois-
Tessonneaud. “L’Oréal has been a pioneer of 
this research for a long time.”  ■

how much of an ingredient to add to a 
product, “we can test the formula with 
different concentrations, to see the tolerance, 
the effect on toxicity,” says Tinois-
Tessonneaud. “That can help them to choose 
the percentage to add to the formula.”
L’Oréal has developed a range of other skin 
models too, mimicking different features of 
human skin. To investigate the way sunlight 
affects ageing, the team incorporated the 
layer of skin under the epidermis, known as 
the dermis. 
The dermis in humans contains sweat 
glands, hair follicles and blood vessels, but 
EpiSkin’s version is simpler. “We mimic the 
dermis by mixing the most important 
component of the dermis in our body, 
collagen, with the most important cells, 
which are fibroblasts,” says Tinois-

MORE than 100 million people
around the world now have access
to electricity for the first time 
thanks to simple solar power 
systems that typically provide 
LED lights and a phone charger. 
More powerful versions include 
radios and even televisions.
The LEDs provide a clean and 
cheap alternative to the kerosene
lamps normally used by those 
with no electricity. “People spend
50 cents a day on kerosene,”  
says Nick Hughes, co-founder of 
M-KOPA Solar of Kenya, which 
has sold 550,000 home solar
power systems in East Africa.
Some families spend a tenth of
their income on fuel for lighting.
“It’s a crazy price for a poor fuel,”
says Hughes.
His firm has just raised the
money it needs to finance a
million more systems, and
Hughes thinks they could
eventually sell up to 11 million in
East Africa alone. And M-KOPA is
just one of many companies now
selling solar power systems to 
people who lack electricity around
the world. There is, in short, no
doubt that the off-grid renewable
energy revolution has begun.
But where is it going to end up?
In South-East Asia and sub-
Saharan Africa, about 1.3 billion
people still lack electricity. Some
think off-grid energy systems will
expand to fill this gap. If so, that 
could let the world’s poorest
people leapfrog conventional 
electricity grids powered by fossil 
fuels entirely and go directly to 
100 per cent renewable systems.
Critics argue that low-power 
solar is no substitute for getting 
poor people onto more plentiful 
and cheaper grid electricity.
However, for the hundreds
of millions of those with no 
immediate prospect of getting
such electricity, off-grid is
better than nothing. And as the 
technology improves and prices 
fall, the systems will become

ever more powerful.
Most of those who lack
electricity live in rural regions
far from the grid. Providing
them with access to electricity
isn’t just a matter of basic
human rights and fairness.
It has also been shown to have
wide socio-economic benefits,
from improving educational
attainment to boosting incomes.
So there is wide agreement
about its importance.
But how do you do it? Until
recently, the main option besides
grid connection was to set up
microgrids covering multiple
homes powered by diesel
generators, which are expensive
and highly polluting.
Light work
Now the falling prices of solar
panels and batteries, along with
more energy-efficient appliances
such as LED bulbs and televisions,
have created another option.
The International Energy Agency
(IEA) estimated earlier this year
that solar home systems will
provide basic electricity to
another 70 million people
over the next five years.
“Off-grid energy has incredibly
high social consequences,”said
Paolo Frankl, head of the IEA’s
renewable division, at the
report’s launch.
Indeed, some proponents of
off-grid solar argue that it can
provide all the wider benefits
of electricity while reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. That
seems like a massive win-win
situation: tackling poverty and
climate change at the same time.
But it’s not that simple.“Anyone
who tells you that this is about
tackling climate change is
misleading you,”says Varun
Sivaram of the Council on Foreign
Relations, a US think tank, and
author of a forthcoming book on
solar power called Taming the Sun.
For starters, the poorest people
use hardly any energy compared
with the richest, whether they
have electricity or not.“Rising
levels of access to modern energy
have a negligible impact on
emissions,”says a 2014 IEA report.
What’s more, cheap solar power
systems have their limitations.
When Greenpeace set up a
low-power solar microgrid in
an Indian village in 2014, the
villagers were so disappointed
they protested and demanded
“real”electricity.
They may have been right to do
so, as several studies have found
that basic home solar doesn’t
appear to provide the broader
socio-economic benefits of grid
access. A two-year randomised
trial in India by Michaël Aklin at
the University of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, and his colleagues
found no evidence that after its
introduction people saved more,
started more businesses or spent
more time working or studying.
“It’s not a silver bullet,”he says.
The reason is probably that
these systems provide so little
electricity. Beefier systems are
available but cost much more.
Home solar systems do at least
reduce kerosene use, which is a
big source of indoor air pollution.
“That’s great news,”says Aklin.
“Kerosene is nasty for health.”
When it comes to providing
access to electricity, most gains
will come from extending
conventional grids, says Sivaram.
And indeed many countries are
trying to do exactly that. Both
India, which has 260 million
people without electricity, and
Nigeria, which has 80 million,
have ambitious plans to extend
grid access.
But electrification will take
time. A 2015 report forecast
that less than 80 per cent of
people in sub-Saharan Africa
will have access to electricity
by 2040, for instance.
So off-grid solar does have a
valuable role to play, says Sivaram.
In the areas where grid access
will be a long time coming or
will never be practical, countries
should be encouraging private
companies such as M-KOPA.
That means getting rid of import
tariffs that make solar expensive
in some African countries, as well
as the kerosene subsidy in India,
which makes it difficult for solar
to compete.
Providing electricity alone,
of course, isn’t enough. It’s no
use having a socket if you have
nothing to plug into it. This is
where the innovative business
models M-KOPA is pioneering
could make a big difference.
Few people in poor regions
can afford to buy a solar power
system outright. Instead, using a
payment system based on mobile
phone credit, they pay M-KOPA
a deposit followed by small daily
payments. After a year, they own
the system outright. If they miss
a payment, the system stops
working until they resume.
“We can turn them on and off
remotely,”says Hughes.
So M-KOPA is effectively
lending money to people who
would never normally be able to
get a loan.“We have a really good
repayment rate, in excess of
90 per cent,”says Hughes.
This approach could allow
people to buy bigger appliances
such as refrigerators, along with
farming equipment and maybe
even electric cars (see“Climate-
friendly cooking”, below left).
“Our technology works with
anything that turns on and off,”
says Hughes.
Given this, full grid access won’t
necessarily put companies like
M-KOPA out of business, then. But
more surprisingly, they may be
able to keep selling solar systems
even to people with grid access.
The grids in many countries are
extremely unreliable, so solar-
powered microgrids are likely to
be used in conjunction with the
conventional grid.“The quality of
the grid is very poor. There are lots
of blackouts,”says Aklin.“I see
potential for a combined system.”
These backup microgrids could
remain separate from the grid,
says Sivaram, or could be designed
to feed power into it. In other
words, off-grid renewables could
end up merging with the grid,
making it more resilient.
“It’s important to neither
see off-grid as a magical perfect
solution or useless,”says
Aklin.“The truth is somewhere
in-between.” ■

Electrification brings educational 
benefits and raises income
Around 3 billion people – including 
many with electricity – still cook 
using solid fuels such as wood, 
dung and charcoal. This produces 
plenty of indoor pollution and a third 
of the outdoor pollution plaguing 
South Asia. 
You might think that wood and 
dung are forms of renewable energy 
and thus climate friendly, but cooking 
with them produces black carbon and 
methane, both of which make the 
planet hotter. Phasing out traditional 
stoves would prevent tens of millions 
of premature deaths and reduce 
global warming by 0.1°C by 2100,  
a study estimated earlier this year.
India is encouraging people to 
switch to gas cookers, which are far 
less polluting. Moving to solar would 
be even better, says Mahesh Bhave, 
whose firm Bhave Power Systems 
plans to sell induction cookers 
powered by solar-charged batteries. 
“Nobody is thinking about [solar] 
cooking,” he says.
Running induction cookers requires 
1500 to 2000-watt systems, which is 
much more than most home solar can 
currently provide, but is fast becoming 
achievable as the prices of solar 
panels and batteries fall.
Bhave is also targeting homes 
connected to the grid. He thinks he 
can sell solar microgrids that run 
induction cookers to relatively 
wealthy apartment blocks to act as  
a backup to unreliable mains power.

COMMENT
How will global temperatures, carbon dioxide levels, electric cars
and Trump’s coal dream fare in 2018, wonders Owen Gaffney
HERE’S a sure-fire 2018 headline:
carbon dioxide in the air hits
levels unprecedented in at least
800,000 years. That’s an easy call,
given emissions are non-zero and
this gas stays aloft for centuries.
What is more concerning is the
rate of increase in carbon dioxide,
which appears to be accelerating
despite a recent dramatic slowing
inemissions fromhumanactivity.
The strong El Niño climate event
of 2015 and 2016 explains some
of this, as it leads to drought and
natural carbon release. But in
2018, with El Niño gone, scientists
will be watching for signs that
land and ocean stores of carbon
are making things worse.
On the flipside, recent record
temperatures are unlikely to be
repeated, thanks to a cooling La
Niña, El Niño’s opposite number.
More good news is that 2018 is
likely to be the year electric cars
become cheaper than diesel and
petrol cars, helped by China’s
expected announcement of an
end to diesel and petrol engines.
March may bring gloom as we
will get a snapshot of the health
of the natural world in five reports

better track? There may be ideas
in the first report from the World

ways to meet the UN’s sustainable

Can France’s bold vaccine law overcome
anti-vax sentiment, asks Laura Spinney
ANEWlawtakesforceon1January
to increase the number of
mandatory childhood vaccines
in France to 11 from 3. It has
provoked a polemic, but the law
is sound. If there is a problem, it
is officials neglecting the main
drivers of vaccine hesitancy.
France isn’t the first nation
to introduce such a law, as anti-
vaccination views rose widely
aftertheWakefieldscandalinthe
UK. However, it has the world’s
worst anti-vax attitudes: a 2016
surveyshowedthat41percentof
people say vaccines are unsafe.
The hope is the law will reverse
a 20-year fall in vaccine coverage
that has eroded herd immunity
and raised the risk of epidemics.
For example, France, stubbornly
below the 95 per cent target for
measles vaccination, saw 24,000
cases of the illness between 2008
and 2016, including 10 deaths.
There are no epidemiological
or clinical reasons why the extra
vaccines – whooping cough,
measles, mumps, hepatitis B,
pneumococcus, Haemophilus
influenzae, meningococcus C
and rubella – should be treated
differently to the existing three.
The edict is also less onerous than
the one it replaces in a key way: 
there are no criminal sanctions. 
Admittedly, unvaccinated 
children will be barred from 
public crèches and schools, so 
most parents will be compelled to 
comply. But it feels less draconian.
Job done then? Not necessarily. 
The hitch is that the government’s 
promotion of the law is lacking. It 
makes its case in established news 
outlets, but rarely on social media 
and the broader internet. Though 
social media use is low in France, 
it still stands at 48 per cent, and 
anti-vax views rule there.

HUGE numbers of children are
gambling online, the UK Gambling
Commission reports. About 25,000
childrenagedbetween11and16meet
the definition of a problem gambler,
according to the commission’s latest
annual survey. And some 370,000
children in England, Scotland and
Wales – 12 per cent of the total – said
they had gambled in the past week.
The most common forms of
gambling that children participate
in take place in the physical realm,
involving fruit machines, scratch
cards or just making wagers with
friends. Now, however, a type of
online gambling called “skin betting”
is also taking off, and a regulatory
blind spot means children are able
to easily take part.
Skins are cosmetic items found in
some video games, which can be 
traded on third-party websites for 
cash. Some sites also let players 
gamble their skins to receive a more 
valuable one. In some cases, this 
gambling is built into the game. For 
example, during a shoot-’em-up, 
players might have a chance to gamble 
one of their weapons with a spin of
a virtual fruit machine.
Skins can normally be earned by
just playing the game, but there is
oftenalsotheoptiontopaywithreal
money for more cracks at winning
them. Nearly half of all children in
the UK are aware of skin betting and
11percentof11to16-year-oldshave
placed a skin bet.
This shouldn’t be possible: people
must be over 18 to gamble in the
UK, and licensed gambling websites
must verify the ages of all of their
customers. Annual reviews can lead
to such sites losing their licence if the
industry regulator feels that they
are not doing a good enough job, so 
they have an incentive to be rigorous.
But skin-betting platforms don’t 
have the same requirements. They 
aren’t legally obliged to take this 
matter seriously, says Rachel O’Connell 
at Trust Elevate, a company focusing  
on age-verification technology.
UK law says that if an item is won 
by a game of chance and can be 
considered to have monetary worth 
then the activity is a form of gambling 
and should be regulated as such. 
Normally, this means that winning an 
item that is only used within a game 
and can’t be “cashed out” doesn’t 
constitute gambling. But now that 
third-party websites allow people 
to trade skins for real money, the line 
is easily blurred.
“It no longer makes sense to 
use formal definitions of what is and 
is not gambling, when what children 
experience is a blur of infotainment, 
celebrity endorsement, free games, 
risky games, games for money, 
games for virtual goods, etc,” says 
Rebecca Cassidy at Goldsmiths, 
University of London.
A quick fix, such as putting skin bets 
on the same level as other forms of 
gambling by slapping an age “gate” on 
certain online games, is likely to have 
some benefit, but it won’t stop every 
instance of underage gambling.
UK gambling laws were last 
updated in 2005, when rules around 
the advertising of gambling were 
relaxed. Since then, children have  
been increasingly exposed to gambling 
in various forms. Now we need new 
laws that are properly adapted to the 
digital age. “The older generation of 
regulator, researcher and policy-maker 
has absolutely no conception of the 
many forms that gambling now takes,” 
says Cassidy.  ■

Lags in both Earth and economic-

So, 2018 will be the year the

A messy midnight feast
DARKNESS in the Chocó rainforest of Ecuador 
holds many surprises, such as this young Andean 
mouse-opossum (Marmosops impavidus) 
plucking a crunchy late-night snack from the air.
It was a lucky moment for herpetologist-
photographer Lucas Bustamante, if not for the 
moth being devoured. The rodent, also known as 
Tschudi’s slender opossum, fell under the glare  
of his head torch, which also lured flying insects, 
creating perfect conditions for a startling image.
So frenzied was the feast that Bustamante was 
showered in debris. “Moth scales were flying all 
around me,” he recalls.
He wasn’t actually looking for mammals when 
he stumbled across this scene; he was searching 
for frogs, lizards and snakes. Bustamante uses  
his photography to raise global awareness  
of amphibians and reptiles, many of them 
endangered, partnering with conservation 
groups in Ecuador and around the world to  
display the rich natural wonders of this place.
The hope is that extinctions can be avoided  
in habitats like the Chocó, which spans Ecuador, 
Colombia and Panama, and is threatened by 
logging, gold mining and drug cultivation. It is  
a treasure trove of life, containing one of the 
highest concentrations of endemic species 
anywhere and probably many undiscovered ones. 
Bustamante hopes to capture more of them on 
camera soon.  Jon White

“The lunar surface is the most 
popular destination outside 
low Earth orbit. It might even 
get a bit crowded”
Everyone is going to the moon, so they say. 
Between national space programmes and 
private initiatives, 2018 is the goal launch year 
for at least eight different missions to the 
moon, making it the most popular destination 
outside low Earth orbit.
Elon Musk said last year that SpaceX plans to 
send two tourists on a jaunt around the moon 
in 2018 using his Falcon Heavy rocket and Crew 
Dragon capsule. Neither of these have flown 
yet, so they face significant testing before their 
intended launch date at the end of the year, and 
even a minor issue with one of them could 
delay the journey. Musk has not revealed the 
identities of the astro-tourists, who will pay an 
undisclosed – but surely astronomical – amount 
of money for the ride. President Trump declared 
in December that the US will send astronauts 
back to the moon, but in this modern moon race, 
plenty of others are set to beat them there. 
The Google Lunar X Prize is the motivation 
for five privately funded groups making efforts 
to launch and land a lunar rover. The first of 
these firms to cruise across the moon’s surface 
and send back video will receive $30 million. 
Barring further extensions – there have been 
several since the challenge was announced in 
2007 – the competition will end on 31 March. 
All the contenders have contracts with launch 
providers, but the rovers are still being built and 
there is no guarantee they will be ready in time 
or survive the voyage.
They are not the only ones getting in on 
moon mania. India aims to launch its first rover 
in March, along with a lunar orbiter and lander. 
China’s Chang’e 4 mission is set to launch in 
December 2018 with the country’s second lunar 
lander and rover. Designed as a backup for their 
predecessors, these have been repurposed for  
a more difficult landing on the far side of the 
moon. Chang’e 3 roamed the lunar surface for  
a year and a half before it stopped transmitting 
in 2015. Now, it will have a pal. In fact, things 
might even get a little crowded. Leah Crane
A bold plan to regenerate missing 
limbs by tweaking the body’s 
bioelectricity could be realised in 
the coming year. Michael Levin 
and his team at Tufts University, 
Massachusetts, have started 
experiments to get mice to regrow 
parts of their paws. 
Levin’s team has already found 
that patterns of electrical activity 
allow cells to communicate with 
each other, and control how 
embryos develop. Earlier this year, 
the group altered this pattern – 
which they call the “bioelectric 
code” – in worms, enabling them 
to grow heads instead of tails and 
vice versa. 
Since then, the team has 
developed a cocktail of chemicals 
that alter the electrical activity of 
cells by changing the way charged 
substances, such as calcium ions, 
move through them. Preliminary 
results suggest this brew can 
boost frogs’ natural ability to 
regrow severed limbs. 
The next step is to do this 
in mammals – a much more 
challenging feat since these 
animals aren’t normally very good 
at regenerating limbs. Mice and 
humans might be able to regrow a 
little piece of a chopped-off finger 
or toe, but that is pretty much it. 
Levin’s goal is to regenerate an 
entire mouse paw – and eventually, 
human limbs.
The team is now applying its 
chemical cocktail to mice missing 
parts of their paws. To do this, 
Levin has created a silk-based gel 
that can be impregnated with the 
cocktail and attached to the end  
of the damaged limb.
There have been some early 
signs of regrowth, although the 
researchers think they will need 
to tweak either the cocktail or  
the way they deliver it to get the 
results they are hoping for. “We’ve 
started with a mouse digit, but 
ultimately it will be an entire paw,” 
says Levin.  Jessica Hamzelou

The 21st century has so far been a golden age of 
hominin discovery. New species like the 7-million-year-
old Sahelanthropus tchadensis and the 300,000-year- 
old Homo naledi have added to our understanding  
of humanity’s past. And the finds will keep coming.
“It doesn’t look like [we’re] sampling something that  
is running out,” says John Hawks at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. “I think in part there’s a greater 
intensity of exploration right now.”
There’s a good chance that a new species will be 
revealed in 2018, with rumours swirling of two major 
finds that could answer many questions.
“Undoubtedly, the biggest gap is between 4 and 
7 million years,” says Fred Spoor at University College 
London. “It’s a huge amount of time that’s so far 
represented by just a few bits and bobs.” Any hominins 
from that period are almost certainly new species, and 
could reveal the earliest stages of hominin evolution.
David Begun at the University of Toronto, Canada, wants 
northerly fossils. In 2017 he studied Graecopithecus, an 
extinct European ape from 7.25 million years ago. He 
claimed it might have been a hominin, meaning Europe 
was home to early hominins. “I would obviously like to 
see more complete material attributable to 
Graecopithecus or one of its relatives,” says Begun.
But for many, the focus is Africa 3 to 3.5 million years 
ago. In the 1990s we thought only one hominin lived 
back then – Lucy’s species Australopithecus afarensis, 
which seemed likely to be our ancestor. But in 2001 
Spoor revealed a second: Kenyanthropus platyops.
It may be crucial, as it might have been more closely 
related to us than A. afarensis was. K. platyops and 
humans (Homo) seem to belong in the same group, 
with burly hominins called Paranthropus. If so, Homo 
and Paranthropus emerged in Kenyanthropus‘s time. 
There’s no trace of them so early – so far.  Colin Barras

Tens of thousands of people will 
die from opioid drug use next year, 
as the US epidemic worsens.
It is thought there were more 
than 53,000 opioid-related deaths 
there in 2016. Official tallies won’t 
be released until next year, but a 
number of states – among them 
Missouri, Mississippi, Connecticut 
and Maryland – have already 
reported higher opioid-related 
death rates for 2017 than for 2016.  
While prescription painkillers 
have played a role in the epidemic, 
crackdowns mean many now get 
opioids on the street – including 
fentanyl, which can be 100 times 
more powerful than heroin.
Given its trajectory, this trend 
is expected to worsen next year. 
In 2016, there were over 21,000 
fentanyl-related deaths – more 
than double the number in 2015 
– meaning the drug overtook heroin 
as a cause of death.
It isn’t just a US problem. 
Drug-related deaths have been 
rising in Europe, and there were 
more than 60 fentanyl-related 
deaths in the UK in 2017.
Governments are finally taking 
notice. Next February, medication 
containing codeine will no longer 
be sold over the counter in 
Australia, where codeine-related 
deaths have more than doubled 
since 2000. This October, President 
Donald Trump declared a national 
public health emergency in the US.
But any improvements there 
next year are likely to be achieved 
by local areas and individual states 
rather than by a government that 
seems reluctant to commit any 
emergency funding to the crisis.
Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
are both already on track to have 
fewer opioid-related deaths next 
year. “I expect a few states may 
begin to emerge as success stories 
to be emulated,” says Michael 
Barnett of Harvard University.

“In 2018, they will publish the 
genomes of over 100,000 
microbes. Thousands will 
be new to science”
Sick of hearing about bitcoin? 
Well it’s unlikely to be any  
different next year, and ICOs,  
the latest cryptocurrency fad,  
will be impossible to escape too. 
This year, Jamie Foxx, Paris 
Hilton and Floyd Mayweather all 
promoted “initial coin offerings”. 
Named to mimic initial public 
offerings, where firms raise 
money in exchange for shares, 
ICOs allow companies to swap 
tokens for cash. These tokens are 
forms of cryptocurrency secured 
using a blockchain, the technology 
behind bitcoin. 
What does a token get you? It 
varies. For Filecoin, a company that 
raised more than $250 million from 
an ICO earlier this year, the tokens 
let you trade hard drive space.  
If you have a few spare gigabytes 
on your home PC, you could  
lend them out to other people  
as cloud storage in exchange for 
Filecoin tokens. 
People who buy tokens during 
an ICO are banking on their value 
increasing. Once the platform is  
up and running, demand for tokens 
will rise, so early investors can sell 
them at a profit – or so the theory 
goes. But if the company goes bust 
or never becomes popular, the 
tokens could rapidly lose their 
value. In this way, ICOs are the 
cryptocurrency world’s answer to 
crowdfunding. You could end up 
backing a killer product or a dud. 
Regulators have no idea what to 
do about ICOs. China has banned 
them, but those elsewhere have 
largely been ignored. In the UK, for 
example, the Financial Conduct 
Authority has said ICOs are “very 
high-risk, speculative investments” 
and that people should be 
prepared to lose their money. 
And there is a lot to lose: 2017 
saw more than $3 billion raised 
by ICOs. It is clear there is an ICO 
bubble, but nobody knows when 
it will burst.  Timothy Revell
Get ready for an explosion of 
life. Next year, thousands of 
previously unknown microbes  
will be revealed.
Bacteria and other microbes  
are all around us, but we know  
only about 1 per cent of them. The 
rest are “microbial dark matter”.
It is hard to study these mystery 
microbes because most can’t  
be grown in labs. They need the 
conditions of their natural habitat – 
be it a hydrothermal vent or our 
intestines – to survive.
Metagenomics gets around  
this by taking a sample from a 
habitat, reading all the DNA in it –  
its metagenome – then using 
computers to painstakingly 
reassemble the genomes of all 
the organisms.
Metagenomics has already 
made big finds. In September, 
Philip Hugenholtz and his team 
at the University of Queensland, 
Australia, used it to identify 1749 
novel microbial species. But that 
was just the tip of the iceberg.
Hugenholtz’s team is set to 
unveil another 382 microbial 
species in 2018. Other groups say 
they have found thousands of new 
species in permafrost, geothermal 
springs, our guts and other places.
Nikos Kyrpides and his team at 
the US Department of Energy 
Joint Genome Institute are leading 
the biggest metagenome project. 
Next year, they will publish the 
genomes of more than 100,000 
microbial species from a range of 
environments. They don’t yet know 
how many are new to science,  
but they expect thousands to be.
Once the genomes have been 
published, we will be able to study 
them to find out what each species 
does. For example, we could scan 
for patterns that resemble genes in 
microorganisms known to produce 
methane or oxygen.
There are many reasons why 
these findings will be important. 
A new species may prove useful 
in medicine or industry, perhaps 
helping to develop different 
antibiotics or turn sewage into 
clean water.
Filling in the microbial family tree 
will also provide clues to our oldest 
evolutionary history. For example, 
we may be able to trace the origins 
of basic life processes such as 
respiration and photosynthesis. 
“This is just the beginning,” says 
Kyrpides.  Alice Klein

“You can see during pregnancy that they already 
have bone fractures in the womb,” says Cecilia 
Götherström of the Karolinska Institute in 
Stockholm, Sweden. She is head of what will be 
the world’s first ever trial of giving fetuses stem  
cell therapy in the womb. 
The aim is to relieve symptoms of, or even cure, 
osteogenesis imperfecta, known as brittle bone 
disease. Babies born with this rare condition have 
bones that fracture easily, caused by having faulty 
genes for collagen, the protein that normally  
reinforces and strengthens bones.
Götherström hopes to prevent this before babies  
are even born, by injecting them with healthy stem  
cells that have been extracted from donated tissue  
from aborted fetuses.
The team will specifically inject mesenchymal  
stem cells, which should go on to make bone with  
fully functioning collagen. “We hope they will home to 
bones, reside there and build them up, so they become 
stronger and grow better,” says Götherström.
“We hope that by intervening so soon, we can treat 
them before fractures and other damage develops in 
the womb,” she says.
The team has got approval to carry out 30 treatments. 
Most of these will be on fetuses, and the stem cells will 
be injected into their mothers’ umbilical veins around 
20 weeks into pregnancy. During their first year of life, 
they will receive four booster injections. A number of 
babies and infants will also be treated.
The team has already given the treatment to a 
small number of fetuses, and had promising results. 
The trial next year will be the first test of the approach to 
include an untreated control group, to see whether the 
treatment really does improve the health of babies with 
this condition. Andy Coghlan

Stay on the edge of your seat. The 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will 
keep smashing particles until the 
end of 2018, although this will be 
our last chance for a while to see  
a new particle emerge from the 
cloud of collisions. A year from 
now, the atom smasher will shut 
down for two years of upgrades. 
With the discovery of the Higgs 
boson in 2012, the LHC completed 
the menagerie predicted by the 
standard model of particle physics. 
It was a victorious moment, but 
we haven’t seen anything as 
monumental since. We know that 
there is exotic physics lurking 
beyond the standard model; dark 
matter and dark energy have not 
yet been explained. But the LHC 
has not seen signs of either – yet. 
“It’s like we’ve done a corner of 
a puzzle, but we don’t know what 
the picture on the box looks like 
and we don’t know what the rest 
of the pieces are,” says Claire Lee, a 
physicist at CERN. If new particles 
are too heavy or last too long 
before they decay, the LHC won’t 
be able to detect them and we  
will either have to build a bigger 
collider or devise new ways to look 
for them.
For now, it’s a numbers game. 
Every second the LHC is running, 
600 million particle collisions 
happen in its detectors, spraying 
out debris. The stuff we’re looking 
for is extremely rare, so it may  
only crop up once every thousand 
billion collisions. That leaves an 
avalanche of data to sift through 
for minuscule anomalies.
That process takes a long 
time – results are still coming out 
from data taken in 2012. So just 
because the cameras will stop 
rolling doesn’t mean the main 
feature is cancelled: weird new 
particles could be hiding in LHC 
data from this year or years past, 
but we might not know for a while.

“It will be an epic seven-year 
journey to reach the 
scorched planet and unravel 
some of its enigmas”
If all goes to plan in 2018, Google 
will unveil a device capable of 
performing calculations that no 
other computer on the planet can 
tackle. The quantum computing 
era is upon us.
Well, sort of. Google is set to 
achieve quantum supremacy, the 
long-awaited first demonstration 
of quantum computers’ ability to 
outperform ordinary machines at 
certain tasks. Regular computing 
bits can be in one of two states: 
0 or 1. Their quantum cousins, 
qubits, get a performance boost  
by storing a mixture of both states 
at the same time.
Google’s planned device has  
just 49 qubits – hardly enough to 
threaten the world’s high-speed 
supercomputers. But the tech 
giant has stacked the deck heavily 
in its favour, choosing to attack a 
problem involving simulating the 
behaviour of random quantum 
objects – a significant home 
advantage for a quantum machine.
This task is useless. Solving  
it won’t build better AI, improve 
image recognition or even help 
filter your emails. But as proof of 
scientific principle, Google’s first 
ever record-beating quantum 
calculation will be a landmark 
event on a par with the launch 
of Sputnik or splitting the atom.
The breakthrough will spark 
a rush to invest in developing 
quantum technology – a field that 
is already surprisingly far along in 
commercialisation. In the next 
decade, quantum computers will 
move from laboratory curiosities 
to actual, useful technology. 
Google seems to be on track  
to hit 49 qubits next year. There is 
just one wrinkle – in October, IBM 
threw Google a curveball with  
a 56-qubit-size simulation on an 
ordinary computer, thus raising the 
bar for quantum supremacy. Next 
year, Google will have to show it is 
up to the challenge.  Jacob Aron
It should be signposted “Welcome 
to hell”. Mercury, the sun’s closest 
neighbour, sees blasts of radiation 
and extreme temperatures – and 
it’s where we’re headed next. 
In October 2018, a probe called 
BepiColombo will set off on an 
epic seven-year voyage to orbit  
the scorched world. Provided it can 
withstand the unforgiving 350°C 
after it arrives in 2025, the craft will 
try to unravel some of the enigmas 
left after observations by two 
previous missions to the planet.
Mariner 10 swept past Mercury 
in 1974 and found, to everyone’s 
surprise, that it had a magnetic 
field, whereas Venus, Mars and the 
moon don’t. More mysteries arose 
when Messenger visited a few 
years ago. In 2009, it confirmed 
that Mercury has a tenuous upper 
atmosphere of charged particles 
too sparse to constitute a true 
atmosphere. In 2012, it spotted 
what appeared to be ice buried in 
deep craters at the poles. 
BepiColombo may confirm that 
the material is indeed solid ice, and 
work out how it survives. “It could 
be that the ice is always in shadow, 
so sunlight never shines on it, 
explaining why it’s been there for 
billions of years,” says Johannes 
Benkhoff of the European Space 
Agency, which is running the 
mission alongside the Japan 
Aerospace Exploration Agency.
Messenger also saw bright 
hollows in the planet’s plains. 
Volatile material may make these 
pits by lifting off from the surface 
and floating into space, maybe 
sublimed by intense heat from 
beneath. If BepiColombo finds that 
material does indeed leave the 
planet, it would be a “sensation”, 
says Benkhoff, because it would 
indicate geological activity on a 
planet thought to be inactive.
BepiColombo may also confirm 
Einstein’s theory of general 
relativity. Mercury’s warped  
orbit might be explained through 
relativistic effects, and because  
we can precisely pin down the 
craft’s position, we can see if the 
planet’s path obeys the theory.
But getting there will be no 
cakewalk. “It’s easier to get to 
Pluto,” says Benkhoff. The craft  
will have to brake against the sun’s 
huge gravitational pull, so must 
take a circuitous route involving one 
Earth flyby, two of Venus and six 
past Mercury itself.  Andy Coghlan

THE ULTIMATE PLAYER
AlphaGo has been going from strength  
to strength. In January, it emerged that 
DeepMind’s Go-playing AI had been lurking 
incognito in online Go tournaments and 
secretly beating some of the world’s top 
human players. And in May it beat Ke Jie,  
the world’s number one player, in Wuzhen, 
China. Finally, in October, DeepMind unveiled  
a new version that hones its considerable  
skills by playing against itself. Three days  
and 4.9 million games later, AlphaGo Zero  
is unbeatable.
GPS SPOOFING ATTACK
Russia may be testing a new system for spoofing 
GPS, we revealed in August. The GPS on board  
a ship off the coast of Russia put it more than 
32 kilometres away from where it really was.  
At least 20 ships were affected. It seems to be  
the first documented use of GPS misdirection.
WEAPONISED PROPAGANDA
Could Facebook really tip the balance in an 
election? In July, we got the first suggestion  
that it could. A study that created Facebook ad 
campaigns tailored to certain groups showed  
how AI can direct political campaigns at people 
based on their personality and political interests, 
potentially influencing their vote.
TURN BACK TIME
In January, we reported on Hanadie Yousef’s work 
on mice at Stanford University. She has developed 
an antibody that blocks the harmful effects of a 
protein that builds up in the blood with age. Then 
in March we revealed that Hartmut Geiger at the 
University of Ulm, Germany, and his team had 
rejuvenated stem cells in the blood of old mice 
using a bone marrow protein. The race is on to 
develop a blood rejuvenation drug. 
EDITING OUR GENOME
We uncovered results from the first study to  
use CRISPR genome editing in normal human 
embryos in March. The team in China had 
corrected genetic mutations in at least some  
of the cells of three embryos. Then we revealed  
in May that as many as 20 human trials of the 
technique for diseases in adults were imminent, 
mostly in China. These included the first to edit 
cells with CRISPR while still inside the body.
REMEMBER THIS
In July, Christine Denny at Columbia University 
and her team revived forgotten memories in 
mice with Alzheimer’s-like symptoms by 
activating the neurons in which memories 
were stored. Perhaps Alzheimer’s just makes 
memories harder to access, rather than 
destroying them.

CLIMATE OF FEAR
The effort to stop climate change hit the buffers
in 2017. DonaldTrump announced that the US
would leave the Paris climate accord, though in
practice it is committed until 2020. Emissions of
greenhouse gases began rising again after holding
steady for three years, and the fraction of our
energy that comes from non-fossil fuels has barely
changed in 25 years. Finally, the climate models
that best fit the observations predict 15 per cent
more warming than is generally expected.
HUMANSARE HOW OLD?
It seems our species is almost twice as ancient
as we thought. For decades anthropologists
have believed that Homo sapiens evolved
200,000 years ago. But H. sapiens-like skulls from
Jebel Irhoud in Morocco have now been dated
to between 250,000 and 350,000 years ago.
The find rewrites our history.
NOW WEARETHREE
For years, we thought only two species
of orangutan existed: the Bornean and the
Sumatran ones. But it turns out there are
three.TheTapanuli orangutan was unveiled
in November. It is the seventh non-human
great ape. But the population is only 800 and
they live in an area smaller than London.
CASSINI’S SWAN SONG
In September, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft ended 
its 20-year mission in spectacular fashion  
by diving directly into Saturn’s atmosphere, 
burning up on the way down. The craft was 
running out of fuel and its fiery demise avoided 
contamination of nearby moons. We already 
miss Cassini’s stunning images of the ringed 
planet, though they will continue to fuel 
discoveries for years to come.
HIDDEN NO MORE
Half of the normal matter in the universe was 
missing – until this year. Made of particles called 
baryons, this bright stuff was spotted hiding out in 
tenuous filaments of gas between galaxies, only 
made visible by combining millions of images.
A FAR-OFF MOON
In July, we reported tantalising hints of an 
exomoon, the first to be detected outside our solar 
system. David Kipping at Columbia University  
in New York and his colleagues used the Kepler 
Space Telescope to find a dip in light as this 
wannabe moon passed in front of its star. If real,  
it is probably as big as Neptune and orbits a 
Jupiter-sized planet 4000 light years away.
“It is now completely clear 
that our best models  
predict more warming  
than the average model”

didn’tthinkmuchoftheNewWorld.He
proclaimedtheAmericas“degenerate”,
asodden,miserablelandfilledwith
weakandinferiorspecies.ButBuffon
reservedhismostbitingcontemptfor
one creature in particular. 
He wrote of their “too short”  
and “badly terminated” legs, of their 
“slowness, stupidity… and even 
habitual sadness”. “These sloths,”  
he continued, “are the lowest term of 
existence in the order of animals with 
flesh and blood. One more defect would 
have made their existence impossible.”
Buffon couldn’t have been more 
wrong. What he saw as shortcomings 
we now realise are exquisite adaptations 
that have allowed sloths to thrive in an 
exceedingly austere niche for at least 
30 million years. In fact, the closer we 
look at sloth biology, the more we see 
just how hard evolution has had to 
work so that these notorious dawdlers 
can take it easy. 
One reason we know so little about 
sloths is that they are surprisingly 
difficult to study. They live high in the 
canopies of South and Central America 
and are extremely hard to spot: they 
are small, they rarely move and their 
fur often gets matted with green algae, 
making them blend in with the leaves.  
To figure out exactly how slow 
they are, in 2014 Jonathan Pauli at 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
and colleagues went to Costa Rica to 
measure the metabolic rates of three-
toed brown-throated sloths and
Hoffmann’s two-toed sloths. He found
that while both species have extremely
slow metabolisms, the three-toed sloth
is a record-breaker. The rate at which it
expends energy in the wild, known
as the field metabolic rate, came in at
162 kilojoules per day per kilogram,
meaning it has lower energy needs 
than any other mammal that isn’t 
hibernating, including renowned 
slouches like koalas (410 kJ/day/kg)  
and giant pandas (185 kJ/day/kg). 
The long way down
Part of the reason sloths are such 
extreme energy savers is their diet. 
They are arboreal folivores, meaning 
they live in trees and eat leaves. It is 
a deeply unpopular lifestyle choice, 
occurring in just 0.2 per cent of 
mammal species, and for good reason:
leaves tend to be rather difficult to 
digest and contain few nutrients. Some
tree-living leaf-eaters, such as howler 
monkeys, get around this by gorging 
on massive quantities of the stuff. 
Sloths have adopted a different 
strategy: they nibble a bit here and 
there, making sure to keep their 
stomachs full. And they don’t rush 
digestion. It can take anywhere from 
two days to nearly two months before 
swallowed food emerges again as dung,
which makes this the longest digestive
process on record for a plant-eating 
mammal. That’s particularly weird 
when you consider that among

MY ANCESTOR 
THE ANTEATER
ST
Look at a three-toed sloth and 
a two-toed sloth side by side and  
you might think they descended  
from a common, tree-living ancestor. 
The truth is much stranger. 
Genetic studies suggest that the 
two branches of living sloths hark back 
to entirely different genera of giant 
ground sloths. Two-toed sloths, it 
seems, come from a family of beasts 
called Megalonyx, roughly the size of 
grizzly bears, while three-toed sloths 
are most closely related to the 
elephant-sized Megatherium. 
It is a great example of convergent 
evolution. But how did they both move 
from the ground to the trees? John 
Nyakatura at Humboldt University in 
Berlin has an idea. 
Sloths are xenarthrans: they belong 
to the same group as anteaters and 
armadillos, both of which boast large, 
curved claws and powerful forelimbs. 
Nyakatura suggests that the last 
common ancestor of today’s sloths 
probably inherited these features 
from their giant ancestors, which were 
powerful diggers, before co-opting 
them for an arboreal lifestyle. If so, the 
common ancestor might have looked 
like the silky anteater, which can move 
upside down beneath branches.

mammals, the digestion rate typically 
depends on body size, with big animals 
taking longer to digest their food.  
A long and winding alimentary  
canal isn’t the only way sloths conserve 
energy. They also allow their body 
temperature to vary wildly compared 
with other mammals. Whereas 
humans hover within a degree of 38°C, 
the three-toed sloths Pauli studied 
allowed swings of nearly 5°C as the 
forest cooled or warmed around them. 
“That’s a huge cost saving,” says Pauli, 
because maintaining a core body 
temperature is energetically expensive. 
But sloths still need a way to warm 
up. Shivering, favoured by most warm-
blooded animals, is for creatures with 
energy to burn. Instead, Pauli says, 
three-toed sloths climb higher into the 
canopy each morning to make the most 
of the sun’s generosity. “They’re on the 
reptile end of being a mammal,” says 
Rebecca Cliffe, a sloth researcher at 
Swansea University in the UK. 
Life as an extreme energy saver does 
have its drawbacks. “Sloths can’t jump,” 
says Cliffe. “They never do anything 
unless they’re holding on with at least 
two hands.” But even beyond saving 
energy, the sloth’s characteristic slow-
motion upside-down walking might 
have another benefit: camouflage. One 
of the sloth’s main predators, the harpy 
eagle, relies on seeing its prey move. 
“Everything in the forest can eat them,” 
says Sam Trull, co-founder of the Sloth 
Institute in Costa Rica. “So they have to 
be careful to go undetected, and one of 
the best ways to do that is to be very 
slow and very quiet.” 
Hanging upside down, completely 
still, for hours on end seems to do the 
trick. Sloths can do this in part thanks
to their long, curved claws, which
their giant ancestors used to excavate 
tunnels (see “My ancestor the anteater,” 
left), but now operate more like coat 
hangers. The constant grip is made 
possible by a lattice of tendons in the 
hands and feet that draw the digits 
closed while at rest. 
But there seems to be more to their 
muscular abilities than that. We usually 
think about muscles as doing one thing 
well, says Michael Butcher, a zoologist 
at Youngstown State University in 
Ohio. An Olympic weightlifter, for 
instance, has muscles capable of

LIVING, FAST AND SLOW 
Sloths aren’t the only creatures 
with extreme energy lifestyles
FAST: Hummingbirds 
Flapping your wings 70 times a 
second is hard work, so it is little 
wonder these tiny birds have 
super-fast metabolisms. If humans 
had the same metabolic rate, we 
would have to eat 155,000 calories 
per day – that’s 77 times as much as 
we actually consume. 
SLOW: Giant tortoises 
Living on islands prone to long 
droughts and food shortages, these 
behemoths can go months without 
sustenance. Alas, such superpowers 
backfired when European seafarers 
realised they could keep them below 
deck as a living larder, and their 
numbers plummeted. 
FAST: Camel spiders 
Most arachnids are sit-and-wait 
predators, relying on webs or  
ambush tactics to take down their 
unsuspecting prey. Not camel spiders, 
properly known as solifugids: they 
run and run and run until they find 
something, anything, to satisfy their 
extremely high energy needs. 
SLOW: Geckos  
Bradfield’s Namib day geckos use 
about one-quarter as much energy as 
other desert geckos. Not only do they 
move and eat very little, they also 
boast special scales that grab heat 
from the sun. They even have the 
ability to absorb 70 per cent of their 
daily water intake from fog.
FAST: Swordfish  
To help them zip around at lightning 
speed, swordfish have huge hearts 
relative to their body size and blood 
containing an unusually high 
concentration of oxygen-carrying 
haemoglobin. They even boast a gland 
in their heads to produce a lubricating 
oil that seems to reduce drag.
SLOW: Greenland sharks 
With lifespans exceeding 400 years, 
Greenland sharks are in it for the long 
haul. They swim slowly, grow just 
1 centimetre a year and the females 
may not become sexually mature 
until they are 156 years old.

small, powerful movements, whereas a
marathon runner’s muscles are geared
towards sustaining long periods of
exertion.“But sloths break that rule,”
he says. They have an uncanny ability
to resist fatigue, as well as a surprising
amount of strength.
To better understand how they do
it, Butcher dissected a dozen sloth
cadavers. He was surprised to see they
had very little muscle tissue – roughly
10 per cent less than you find in other
arboreal mammals. But what muscle
there is appears to be extraordinary.
Most strikingly, sloth muscles
seem to contain a unique set of
enzymes that confers tolerance to
heavy accumulations of lactic acid,
which may help them resist fatigue as
they hang out or move in super-slow
motion. Butcher’s latest work, which
hasn’t yet been published, suggests
that sloths have enzyme profiles
similar to fast-running cats such
as cheetahs.“Sprinting is all about
anaerobic power for short durations,”
says Butcher.“So it is odd and
Hummingbirds
burn energy faster
than every other
vertebrate
fascinating that a sloth that hangs for 
extended periods of time matches that 
metabolic profile.” 
The plot thickens when you consider 
that anaerobic power is less efficient 
because, while it can create energy 
quickly, it can only create a fraction of 
the energy that aerobic mechanisms 
produce. And yet for an animal that has 
spent millions of years trending toward 
energetic thrift, a little bit of immediate 
energy from time to time seems to be 
the least wasteful way to power their 
occasional perambulations. 
For all these fresh insights, there is 
still a lot to learn about sloths. We don’t 
know why they climb all the way down 
to the forest floor to defecate, for 
instance, never mind why they bury 
the mess. It doesn’t seem very frugal. 
Perhaps it is a form of communication, 
says Cliffe. It could even be linked to a 
putative nutrient cycle involving the 
algae that colonise the sloths’ fur and 
certain moths that share this just-
about mobile home, Pauli suggests. 
One thing is clear, though: the more 
we learn about these extraordinary 
creatures and their unhurried lifestyle, 
the easier it is to appreciate how diet 
and metabolism can drive evolutionary 
adaptation. And that applies to us 
humans too.   
In 2016, Herman Pontzer at the 
City University of New York and his 
colleagues compared human energy 
expenditure to that of chimpanzees, 
bonobos, gorillas and orangutans, and 
found that we burn calories 27 per cent 
faster than other primates. The 
researchers reason that this dramatic 
uptick afforded us not only enhanced 
brainpower, but also the opportunity 
for faster reproduction and longer 
lives. These changes probably occurred 
as we diversified our diets and ate more 
high-calorie foods, like meat. We also 
started to get fatter, probably as 
insurance against food shortages.  
If that last fact hits a little too close to 
home at this time of year, don’t look to 
the sloths for lifestyle tips. It has taken 
them millions of years to acquire the 
behaviours and anatomy to live the 
way they do. You are unlikely to 
reproduce it in the six weeks you might 
invest in a New Year’s resolution.  Q

However, it is part of a series of
images called Thirty-six Views of Mount
Fuji by the artist Hokusai, and if you
flick through them, you will notice
that nearly every one is predominantly
blue. That might seem strange, until
you realise that in 1830, when Hokusai
began printing these works, blue was
rather a new thing. The Prussian blue
he used had been introduced into Japan
just a few years earlier, giving artists
their first blue pigment that was bright,
attractive and lasting.
“Historically, blue has been a big
issue for artists; there are very few
natural blue colours,”says materials
scientist David Dobson at University
College London. These days, we have
plenty of blue dyes, which, being
soluble, are ideal for colouring
materials uniformly. But the insoluble
blue pigments needed for paints,
printing inks, ceramics and plastics
are still rare. That is why, when Dobson
realised that he might be able to
create a new one based on a mineral
that can exist only at the immense
pressures found 500 kilometres
beneath Earth’s surface, he was very
much up for the challenge.
The colour blue has proved such a
problem to recreate that most ancient
cultures don’t seem to have had a word
for it – Homer famously describes the
“wine-dark”sea. Only the ancient
Egyptians are known to have had one,
and it’s probably no coincidence that
they alone were able to produce a blue
pigment. Egyptian blue was used
widely until the Middle Ages when the
recipe was lost and artists had to resort
to either azurite or ultramarine (see
“True blue”, page 48). Both were made
from naturally occurring minerals,
the latter from lapis lazuli. This was
exorbitantly expensive, explaining
why blue tended to be reserved for
high-ticket items such as the Virgin
Mary’s robes.
Dobson, who is an artist as well
as a scientist, has a long-running
collaboration with Jo Volley at UCL’s
Slade School of Fine Art. However,
he was unaware of just how rare blue
pigments are until a few years ago.
His epiphany came when he attended a
meeting of artists to describe his work
with one of Volley’s students hunting
for new pigments in coal-mine sludge.
The conference was abuzz with the
discovery of a pigment called YInMn
blue. Volley explained that everyone
was excited about it because blues are
so rare. That got Dobson thinking about
another blue he had seen – a mineral
that had been discovered deep in the
bowels of our planet.
It’s not easy to know exactly
what rocks deep inside Earth are like
because they exist under extreme
pressures and change when brought
to the surface as the minerals become
distorted. However, sometimes
diamonds are dug up that bear

of the planet to create new ones, says Joshua Howgego

“inclusions” – minerals within them 
that are trapped at the pressures they
experience during formation. In 2014,
Graham Pearson at the University of 
Alberta, Canada, found such a diamond
containing the mineral ringwoodite. 
Geologists were fascinated because 
it addressed a long-running debate 
about where Earth’s water came from;
it is thought that ringwoodite in the 
mantle contains enough water to fill 
the surface oceans three times over.  
But Pearson’s discovery intrigued 
Dobson for an entirely different  
reason: the mineral was blue.
Now, ringwoodite’s structure would
collapse and lose its intense colour 
at normal surface pressures, but 
Dobson wondered if it might be 
possible to capture its blueness by
engineering a crystal that mimicked
it at surface pressure.
You can think of a crystal a bit like a
3D version of the colourful, tessellated
tiling often seen in Islamic buildings.
Each atom in the crystal structure is
like a tile that must fit snugly next to its
neighbours. Dobson made an educated
guess that the key to ringwoodite’s
blueness was the iron atoms. These
were in a tetrahedral configuration, in 
which each is surrounded by four other 
atoms. “If you could put an iron ion 
into a tetrahedral coordination, it 
should end up going blue,” he says.
In January 2017, Dobson got a chance 
to test this idea when he became the 
first scientist in residence at the Slade 
School. What he needed was a mineral 
that would interact with iron ions to 
give a crystal with the characteristic 
tetrahedral configuration found in 
ringwoodite. First he looked at a series 
of minerals called spinels, which have 
a cubic crystalline structure. One 
of these, magnesium aluminate 
(MgAl2O4), seemed perfect because its 
aluminium ions have the same charge 
as the iron ions in ringwoodite. But 
when he tried baking it in an oven with 
a source of iron, he found the iron kept 
slipping into the wrong size gaps – 
surrounding itself with eight oxygen 
atoms rather than four. “It ended up 
just brown,” says Dobson.
Then he hit on two other 
compounds, zinc silicate (ZnSiO4) 
and zinc germanate (ZnGeO4),  
which contain zinc in just the  
right configuration. When he tried 
substituting the zinc for iron, lo and 
behold he got two new blues. The 
silicate is a soft, greenish blue that 
Dobson describes as “duck egg”. 
The germanate gives a richer  
“deep water blue”. 
A manufacturer of fine-art 
products has already shown interest 
in commercialising his blues. But 
there is still a hurdle to overcome. At 
the moment, when the compound 
Dobson has created is ground into a 
fine powder to suspend into a liquid 
paint, its colour dims. That’s because it 
contains too little iron. But if he adds 
too much, the blue will disappear. 
The balance of iron and zinc in the 
compound needs to be just right.
“That’s what I’m working on now: 
trying to see how much iron I can 
dissolve into these structures and so 
how intense I can get the blue,” says 
Dobson. “Unfortunately, a student 
recently blew up my furnace, so that’s 
hampering progress.” 
But then, no one said making a new 
blue would be easy.  Q

TRUE BLUE
AZURITE  
The first blue pigment. Originally made by 
grinding up the mineral azurite, a copper 
carbonate. Synthesised artificially from the 
17th century. Can dehydrate into malachite, 
another copper carbonate, which is green.
ULTRAMARINE  
Made as early as 7000 BC in Afghanistan 
from lapis lazuli. Famously used on 
Tutankhamun’s death mask, illuminated 
manuscripts and Italian panel paintings. 
In the Renaissance it was more expensive 
than gold. First synthesised in 1826.
PRUSSIAN BLUE  
The first modern synthetic pigment. 
Discovered by accident in 1706, and 
produced by the oxidation of ferrous 
ferrocyanide salts. Exemplified by  
Hokusai’s The Great Wave off Kanagawa 
and Van Gogh’s The Starry Night. It fades  
to grey over time.
COBALT BLUE  
A mixture of cobalt, aluminium and 
oxygen. Discovered by French chemist 
Louis Jacques Thénard in 1802. Famously 
used in Bristol blue glass. The pigment is 
very stable but costly, and cobalt is toxic 
when inhaled or ingested.
YINMN BLUE  
Discovered by Mas Subramanian at Oregon 
State University in 2009. An inorganic 
pigment, prepared by heating oxides of 
yttrium, indium and manganese to around 
1200°C. It is chemically stable, non-toxic 
and does not fade.

First casualty in 
the robot wars
W
E ALL know how it ends: the 
machines rise up to enslave 
their puny masters. Robots  
and artificial intelligences may so far 
have confined themselves to blameless 
pursuits such as vacuum cleaning, 
beating us at board games and 
recommending products we might  
also like. But as they continue their 
inexorable rise, entering a “singularity” 
of runaway self-improvement, they 
will inevitably turn their attention to 
robopocalypse. Stephen Hawking says 
AI could spell the end for humanity. 
Elon Musk thinks it could lead to world 
war three. Vladimir Putin says whoever 
controls AI will control the world.
Maybe so. But as comic strip author 
Randall Munroe – himself formerly a 
roboticist – puts it in his book What If? 
Serious scientific answers to absurd 
hypothetical questions: “What people 
don’t appreciate, when they picture 
Terminator-style automatons striding 
triumphantly across a mountain of 
human skulls, is how hard it is to keep 
your footing on something as unstable 
as a mountain of human skulls.”
Far from being a steady march to 
greatness, the past and present of 
robotics and AI are littered with 
examples of banal practicalities tying 
machines down. If you want to look at 
what the future of AI really holds, it’s
not the highlight reels that matter –  
it’s the out-takes.

Massachusetts, makes some of the 
most advanced robots in the world. In a
TED talk earlier this year, founder Marc
Raibert showed off his firm’s range of
Artificial 
incompetence
Will robots take over the world? 
Nah, says Douglas Heaven
machines. There is BigDog, a four-
legged metal pack mule that can  
cope with stairs and rough terrain; 
WildCat, which can run at more than 
30 kilometres an hour; and SpotMini,  
a dog-like robot designed for homes 
and offices that has an arm for a head.
Impressive, or terrifying, depending 
on your point of view. But Raibert 
also played a video that showed the 
humanoid Atlas robot missing some 
shelves where it was supposed to 
deposit a carton, then tripping over the 
shelves and finally falling flat on its face.
The fact is, moving is hard. So is not 
moving: when we stand still, our brains 
have to tell our muscles to make tiny 
adjustments all the time just to keep 
us upright. Robots are terrible at it. 
They aren’t very good at opening 
doors either. And for all BigDog’s 
abilities, don’t even talk about stairs. 
Judging by the awkward ascents of 
most robots, to avoid the rise of the 
machines we only need to retreat to 
the mezzanine.
Robots that aren’t quite as good  
as they seem have a glorious lineage.  
At the 1939 World’s Fair in New York,  
the Westinghouse Electric Corporation 
paraded Elektro the Moto-Man, a 
“talking”, cigarette-smoking robot.  
It could move a little, count its fingers 
and utter lines such as “I am Elektro” 
and “My brain is bigger than yours”. 
Standing more than 2 metres tall, the 
golden humanoid wowed crowds. 
Westinghouse even built it with a 
hole in its chest lest people think 
there were human operators inside.
Actually, Wizard-of-Oz-like, they 
were behind a curtain. A light bulb 
would flash to signal that a voice 
command had been received,  
so they could press a button to play 
a recording. Elektro went on tour 
again in 1950 and appeared as campus 
computer Thinko in the 1960 comedy 
romp Sex Kittens Go to College, proving 
that, in common with their human 
creators, robots have no shame.
In fairness, Elektro was more 
publicity stunt than the stuff of serious 
research. Not so NASA’s hydraulic, 
spacesuit-testing robot of the early 
1960s. Built by Joe Slowik, an engineer 
at the Illinois Institute of Technology  
in Chicago, the idea was to kit the robot 
out in the latest experimental suit and 
suspend it from the ceiling to mimic 
the effects of zero gravity. An operator 
would guide it through a repertoire of 
lifelike movements using a network of 
small tubes carrying high-pressure oil 
under the robot’s aluminium skin. 
But the tubes weren’t strong enough 
to contain the pressurised oil and 
leaked. Crippled by incontinence, the 
robot ended its days wearing a nappy,  
a wetsuit used to contain the fluid.  
It never graduated to a spacesuit. 
Most robotics researchers have their 
favourite bad robot story. For Alan 
Winfield at the Bristol Robotics Lab in 
the UK, it involves an assembly-line 
robot rigged to open a fridge and pass 
out cans of Coke to passers-by at a trade 
show. The fridge door stopped working, 
so the robot arm punched its way 
through, grabbed a can and then lifted
the entire fridge as it tried to remove

the drink. If that’s back in the realm of 
the unnerving, Winfield does note that 
although he has heard the story many 
times, it might be apocryphal.
Roomba, the robotic vacuum
cleaner, is very real. When Jesse 
Newton’s example encountered puppy 
mess in the middle of its nightly clean, 
it simply continued its cycle, smearing 
it over the entire floor. Never mind 
robopocalypse, this was “poocalypse”, 
in Newton’s words. According to a 
spokesperson for iRobot, the company 
that makes Roomba, it wasn’t an 
isolated incident.
The popularity of YouTube videos 
celebrating robotic epic fails is proof  
of our schadenfreude when robots go 
wrong. “Watching things fail is always 
funny and with robots you avoid the 
need to feel bad,” says the founder of 
the “Shitty Robots” forum on the web 
discussion site Reddit, who goes by the 
name mr_bag. “I also quite enjoy how 
the robots in question often manage to 
come across as being quite proud of 
their achievement.”
But Winfield thinks out-take videos 
serve a more serious purpose. Greater 
familiarity with dead ends and failed
experiments would help counter
the Hawking-Musk narrative that
a superintelligence will take over
the world, he says. It shows AI and
robotics for what they are: very human 
endeavours whose products are limited 
by human flaws and foibles. “They are a 
great reality check that real-world robots 
fall well short of the hype,” he says.
If machines aren’t all they are 
cracked up to be (see main 
story), some were never meant 
to be any good in the first place. 
There is something cathartic 
about a useless machine. 
Perhaps it comes from our 
unease about our perceived 
diminishing place in the scheme 
of things, but a machine that 
clearly does nothing – or even 
defeats itself – makes us feel 
better for a moment.
Take AI pioneer Marvin 
Minsky’s mechanised box. Its 
sole action when switched on 
was to extend a hand to turn 
itself off again. Minsky also 
invented a machine that would 
ring a bell if it sensed that the 
gravitational constant had 
changed.
The Unplugger robot, created 
by “sculptor of the useless and 
absurd” Nik Ramage, is a more 
recent variant on this theme. 
Plugged into a power socket by 
a short cable, this steampunk 
contraption trundles forwards 
until it pulls out its own plug. 
Occasionally, tech nihilism 
takes on a darker flavour. Artist 
Matt Kenyon has built a small, 
wheeled robot that searches  
for and sucks up puddles of 
Coca-Cola from the floor 
through a straw, before spraying 
the drink over itself. The acidic 
liquid slowly eats through the 
robot’s skin until it reaches the 
circuitry, causing a breakdown. 
Simone Giertz, YouTube’s 
“queen of shitty robots”, has 
become synonymous with the 
form. Starting with an idea for a 
machine that she would actually 
like to have, Giertz builds 
something so over the top that it 
is ridiculous. “It’s funny in the 
same way as a well-trained 
show dog suddenly stopping  
to poop on the arena floor,”  
she says. Highlights include a 
breakfast-making robot that 
hurls Cheerios and milk over a 
table, a lipstick applicator that 
smears make-up across her 
cheeks and a wake-up device 
that slaps her repeatedly before 
getting tangled in her hair. In 
her videos, Giertz sits blithely 
by – a picture of the human 
serenity we should adopt in the 
midst of mechanical meltdown.

I
T’S blowy on the B4380 to Buildwas. 
A keen wind whipping across the 
floodplain from Shrewsbury flaps a 
misarranged saddle bag strap against 
my back wheel. As I cross the river 
Severn at Atcham, and bend right down 
the back road past Wroxeter, a black 
cloud delivers the first dribbles of rain.
England’s place names are a treasure 
trove of hidden history – if only  
we could find the key. Shrewsbury: 
recorded in the 10th century as 
Scrobbesbyrig, the name’s origin is as 
uncertain as its pronunciation today, 
but possibly means “the fortified place 
in the scrub”. Atcham: a contraction of 
Attingham, “the homestead of Eata’s 
children”, a puzzling reference to an 
obscure 7th-century saint from 
England’s far north. Wroxeter: origin 
disputed, but a rare Roman place name 
survival, as befits the site of what was 
Roman Britain’s fourth largest town. 
Buildwas: we’ll get to that.
In the title of one of her books, 
Margaret Gelling, the doyenne of 
English toponymists, called place 
names “signposts to the past”. 
I’m cycling the road to Buildwas 
because they could be signposts 
to the future, too.
I take refuge from the now intense, 
globular rain in the shadow of a large 
hedge on a bluff overlooking the 
floodplain just beyond Eyton – a 
homestead on a raised promontory – 
on Severn. Britain is a wet island, 
and it’s getting wetter. This is just a 
passing autumn shower, but as global 
temperatures rise, the paths of the 
most severe Atlantic storms are hitting 
the western shores of Britain and 
Ireland more frequently, often 
dumping large quantities of rain in 
short periods. 
Just before Christmas 2015, Storm 
Desmond broke the UK’s two-day 
rainfall record, and caused flooding and 
disruption over much of the country. 
Similar extreme rainfall had already 
hit  parts of the country in the summer 
of 2007 and in the 2009 to 2010 and 
2013 to 2014 winter seasons. The UK 
Environment Agency estimates that 
one in six households and businesses 
in England are now at risk of flooding.
Warm and stormy
This sequence of events is without 
parallel in the 300 or so years the UK 
has had consistent weather records,  
but a historical precedent can be found 
if you go back far enough. Various 
strands of evidence point to a sustained 
period of warming across England 
between the 7th and the 10th centuries 
that brought more storminess with it. 
“The Anglo-Saxons also experienced  
a lot of extreme weather events like 
Storm Desmond,” says landscape 
historian Richard Jones of the 
University of Leicester, UK.
This happens to be when most 
English place names were coined. 
When the Severn flooded in 2007,  
it struck Jones that these names hold 
clues to the flood risks that prevailed  
at a time of rapid climate change – and 
perhaps highlight the increasing risk
we face as we move into a similar 
regime today. “I realised there was a
Wet’s in

We could learn a lot from England’s soggy 
Anglo-Saxon place names, says Richard Webb
>
It is probably wise counsel to look in 
the mirror if we want to see what the 
future truly holds for AI. Besides a lot  
of machines that will undoubtedly be 
useful in our daily lives, the picture 
includes a good few robots unwittingly 
replicating human klutziness – and 
AIs adopting the worst of human 
intelligence. 
Take Microsoft’s Tay, the chatbot it 
debuted in 2016. Designed to interact 
with people on social media by picking 
up their natural phrasing and slang,  
it was almost immediately tricked  
into making racist and inflammatory 
comments. Microsoft pulled the plug 
within 24 hours.
Robopocalypse never
So perhaps what we should fear is  
not so much the robots as ourselves. 
“Focusing on implausible futures like 
Skynet or the singularity distracts 
from real issues that are happening 
today,” says Mark Riedl, an artificial 
intelligence researcher at the Georgia 
Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The signs are that most of us 
would rather be distracted. Earlier 
this year, Facebook announced it was 
discontinuing an experiment to get 
bots to learn to negotiate because the 
AI wasn’t haggling in human-readable 
language, making it hard to understand 
what they were up to. That got mangled 
by many news outlets into Facebook 
shutting the experiment down because 
the AI was getting too smart.
The Facebook incident spawned  
a meme among AI researchers of 
congratulating each other on a sudden 
or unexpected result by sending 
messages saying “shut it down!”.  
But the truth is that rumours of the 
singularity are vastly exaggerated, even 
if they are often propounded by those 
who should know better.
Riedl thinks his peers need to 
acknowledge that the perils of physical 
existence and the very human flaws 
that AIs adopt mean they will always, 
ultimately, be dragged down to our 
level. Nemesis comes before hubris, 
says Riedl. “One thing that would be 
healthy for the entire field of AI is if we 
had more recognition of failures.”  Q

relationship between those places 
suffering the most and water-related 
names,” he says. “It intrigued me – and 
I did nothing about it.”
That changed in 2014, when winter 
floods hit the Somerset Levels in south-
west England. “I was struck by the 
plight of the village of Muchelney,”  
says Jones. “People were saying, I can’t 
believe it’s turned into a big island.  
But it’s in the name.” Ey, as also in 
Eyton, is a common Anglo-Saxon 
place name element meaning just 
that: an island or raised promontory  
(see “Five flood-prone names”, below).
That was the genesis of a research 
project called “Flood and flow”:  
a confluence of historians, place name
specialists and archaeologists that 
aimed to investigate the connections
between place names and flood risk, 
and what that might tell us about the
effects of climate change and other 
human activities.
It’s a division of labour: the 
toponymists identify place names  
of interest, and the archaeologists go
digging there to see what they can  
find. A technique known as optically 
stimulated luminescence allows them
to date when a layer of soil in a core  
dug out from a riverbank or floodplain
at a place of interest last saw sunlight –
and so when, approximately, it was  
laid down in a flood. That can be used
in tandem with information on the 
chemical composition of the soil,  
its magnetic properties and the 
granularity of the deposits – clay  
and silt from quieter floods, coarser 
material from highly energetic flash 
Island story:
Muchelney in
January 2014
ey – island, area of raised ground in 
wet country
This is one of the most common 
reliably wet Anglo-Saxon place-
name elements, with examples 
including Bermondsey, Chertsey, 
Hackney and Witney. 
slaep – slippery place
Perhaps understandably, few of 
these places have achieved 
greatness, although a sprinkling of 
Slaptons, Islip near Oxford and 
possibly Ruislip in Greater London 
indicate places where you should 
watch your step.
hamm – land surrounded by water 
or marsh
Frustratingly close to a simple 
“ham”, meaning a homestead or 
settlement, this element has long 
been misidentified, leading one 
eminent toponymist to describe it as 
a “long-suffering” place-name element. 
Reasonably certain instances include 
Chippenham, Evesham, Fulham, 
Twickenham and Southampton.
holmr – inland promontory, raised 
ground in marsh
Confusingly, over the years often 
also corrupted to “ham”, this is 
actually an Old Norse element similar 
in meaning to “ey”. Prominent 
examples are Durham and Oldham.
sloh – muddy place, mire
As in Slough.
flooding – to build up a picture of flood
intensity over time.“We can look at the
physical sequence of flooding against
the coining of names, and find place
names that warn explicitly against
flood or types of flood,”says Ben Pears
of the University of Southampton,
UK, an archaeologist on the project.
The wases are a case in point. English
place names do not often include the
element was, so it was an ideal sample
for the team to start its investigations.
It has a very specific meaning – one
pinned down by Gelling as“alluvial
land by a meandering river that floods
and drains quickly”. One example is
FIVE FLOOD-
PRONE NAMES
Wasperton, a tiny village just south of 
Warwick in the English Midlands. Cores 
extracted there show sequences of very 
quick flooding laying down lots of 
coarse sediment before disappearing 
quickly again. Here, there’s a double 
clue in the name: “perton” indicates a 
place with a pear orchard. “Pears don’t 
like waterlogged soil,” says Pears.
Buildwas has perhaps the most 
spectacular site of all the wases, 
situated where the widely meandering 
Severn enters the confines of 
Ironbridge Gorge. It’s looking soggy 
when I arrive, although the river 
doesn’t seem inclined to burst its banks

after just one October shower. But the 
secrets lie in the soil. Information the 
team has extracted from soil cores 
there show a dramatic flood event in 
the late Roman period; frequent, more 
moderate flooding from the 8th to the 
10th centuries; and another distinct 
flooding maximum at the start of the 
10th century, just when the name was 
being coined. “If Buildwas had been 
established in the 12th century it would 
have been highly unlikely to have got 
the name it did,” says Jones. 
Meanders of history
Is it a surprise that places with watery 
names are more prone to flooding? It’s 
a fair enough question, says Jones. But 
the intriguing thing revealed by the digs 
is just how nuanced the information 
contained in place names can be.  
“How do places flood? Fast? Slow? Does 
the inundated water sit there, or drain 
away quite rapidly?” he says. “We can 
start to map this kind of historical 
evidence with what we see today.” 
What’s more, later medieval mapping 
and manorial records naming small 
areas and even specific fields could allow 
us to build up fine-grained maps of 
historical, and contemporary, flood risk. 
“Place names became redundant 
because we stopped paying attention  
to them,” says Jones. In the cooler late 
medieval and early modern periods, 
they were no longer describing rivers  
as they were – so we started building  
on floodplains. “But in the past two 
decades they are describing how the 
rivers behave again,” says Jones.  
“It’s very exciting.” It’s not just river 
behaviour, either. Forest and tree-
related names might help inform 
strategies for rewooding, for example, 
or river-related names tell us about 
former sinuosity for remeandering, 
again to reduce flood risk.
In the end it’s just about 
reconnecting us with a source of 
knowledge we’ve been living with for 
hundreds of years, but whose value we 
had forgotten, says Pears. “We spoke to 
a farmer in Buildwas, and he knew that 
the water didn’t stay long when it 
floods, but he didn’t know it was 
already in the name.”  Q

F YOU happen to have travelled on 
the London Underground’s District, 
Circle or Hammersmith & City lines in 
the past three months, you may have 
spotted the legendary Russian chemist 
Dmitri Mendeleev, creator of the 
periodic table. Not in person of course, 
but splashed across the side of a special 
train celebrating Russian achievements 
in science, space and the arts.
When The Heart of Russia took to the 
rails in October, the British Council 
announced that it would be running a 
similar stunt on the Moscow Metro: a 
Science Train adorned with images of 
Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Michael 
Faraday and the like. Part of something 
called the UK-Russia Year of Science 
and Education, one of its goals was to
improve the reputation of British 
scientists in Russia.
God knows they need it. But the train 
never materialised, perhaps because it 
would have instantly become the object 
of ridicule.
When they hear the phrase “British 
scientists”, Russians don’t tend to think 
of Newton, Darwin or Faraday; nor do 
they think of Stephen Hawking or Peter 
Higgs. Instead, they are much more 
likely to think of psychologist Richard 
Stephens of Keele University, who 
earlier this year showed that swearing
can help reduce pain. Or Olli Loukola,

University of London, who has taught
bumblebees how to play football.
The phrase“British scientists”is a
meme that you’ll regularly encounter
if you search the Russian-language
parts of the internet. It is defined on
the online encyclopaedia Lurkmore as
“a synonym for researchers working
on pseudoscientific projects that are
bonkers, idiotic and have absolutely
no practical value”. In the past year,
Russian news outlets have reported
that“British scientists have found that
fish have personalities”, that“British
scientists have discovered the best time
to make love”, that“British scientists
have calculated the IQ of cats”, and 
many more in the same vein.
These are at least genuine studies
by real scientists. Russians also tell
a genre of satirical jokes that start
“British scientists have discovered…”.
For example,“British scientists have
proven that birthdays are good for you:
people who have the most live the
longest”. And“British scientists have
invented a way to walk through walls.
They called it a door”. There’s also the
(rather lame)“British scientists have
discovered that British scientists live
in Britain”, but in fact, this is not always
true. The term is now so ubiquitous
that anyone who conducts frivolous
studies, including Russians, can be
described as British Scientists.
So why do British scientists have
this reputation in Russia? Last year,  
BONKERS… OR NOT
Can you work out which of these are 
Russian headlines about real studies,  
and which are jokes?
1. British scientists have established  
the height of Cinderella’s heels.
2. British scientists have found that 
women more often reach orgasm if  
they have sex in their socks.
3. British scientists have invented a  
teacup for left-handed people.
4. British scientists have found that 
ostriches become sexually active in  
the presence of humans.
5. British scientists have discovered  
that primates can find the connection 
between a cassette tape and a pencil  
more quickly than people born after 1995.

popular in the Russian-speaking world,
and a number of Russian journalists 
travel to Harvard University to cover 
the event each year. The awards get a lot
of nominations from Russia, but not 
nearly as many as from the two most 
successful nations, Japan and the UK. 
So why are scientists from these two 
countries more likely to write winning
papers? Abrahams thinks it’s down to 
national culture. “There are eccentric 
people everywhere, but they are treated
differently in different countries,”  
he says. “In some places they are 
punished, but in the UK and Japan 
people are proud that ‘they are our 
eccentrics’. In fact, the term ‘British 
eccentrics’ is also common, not just 
in Russia, but around the world.”
There may, however, be a more 
sinister explanation. Lurkmore 
suggests that the meme gained 
prominence around the time of the 
fatal poisoning of former Russian 
agent Alexander Litvinenko in London.
The implication is that the Russian 
government pushed the meme to 
undermine British scientists at a 
time when they were expected to find 
evidence linking Litvinenko’s death 
to the Kremlin.
The claim seems plausible given 
recent accusations of Russia’s election 
hacking and fake-news creating, but 
the timings don’t quite add up: the 
meme first hit the internet in 2003, 
three years before Litvinenko’s death. 
It’s possible that the Kremlin saw an 
opportunity and encouraged its spread, 
but there’s no real evidence for this. 
Perhaps we should set some British 
Scientists to get to the bottom of it.
If the meme did begin as a negative 
publicity campaign, it hasn’t worked. 
British scientists are now a much-loved 
part of Russian folklore. In the past 
year, RIA Novosti has run twice as many 
articles mentioning British scientists as 
US ones, and almost 10 times as many 
as Japanese scientists. Russian rock 
band Mediavirus wrote a hit song called 
British Scientists; British Scientists is 
the name of a chain of coffee shops in 
the city of Krasnoyarsk.
The meme is now so popular that 
a discovery made in an obscure lab of  
a lesser British university, and which 
barely makes a ripple in the UK 
press, can make national headlines 
in Russia. And while the angle is 
usually humorous, these are often real, 
interesting and sometimes important 
studies. Just like the winners of the Ig 
Nobel prizes, it is science that makes 
you laugh… then makes you think. 
The UK may not be at the forefront  
of very much these days, but when it 
comes to serious humour, we still take 
some beating.  Q
James Harkin likes bonkers and idiotic 
projects. He is one of the QI Elves, the 
research team for the BBC panel show QI, 
appears on the podcast No Such Thing as a 
Fish and is co-author of The Book of the Year, 
published by Random House
RIA Novosti, one of Russia’s state news 
agencies, announced that British 
scientists themselves had discovered 
the answer. In a story entitled “British 
scientists have explained why ‘British 
Scientists’ exist”, it reported a paper by 
Andrew Higginson and Marcus Munafo 
at Exeter and Bristol universities. 
Wanting to explore strategies for career 
success in science, they turned to a 
model usually used to predict optimal 
behaviour in animals. They found that 
it is in scientists’ best interest to search 
out novel results and conduct small 
studies with less rigorous statistical 
analysis. Their paper was not specific 
to British scientists, but Higginson 
argues that the findings are especially 
pertinent to the UK due to something 
called the Research Excellence 
Framework. This, he says, preferentially 
gives research money to institutions 
with a track record of publishing in top 
journals, which are massively biased 
towards strikingly novel findings.
Harmless eccentrics
I asked Higginson what he thought 
about his paper becoming such a big 
story in Russia. “Bemused,” he said. 
He was at pains to point out that the 
headlines in Russia were not strictly 
true: his research was concerned with 
novel findings rather than frivolous 
ones, which may sometimes overlap 
but are not the same thing.
Nonetheless, he also said he was 
proud to have done some research that 
qualified him to be a British Scientist. 
“Intrigued too,” he said, “as it’s got 
me interested in the role of satire in 
Russian life.”
I also asked Marc Abrahams, founder 
of the Annals of Improbable Research 
and the man behind the Ig Nobel prizes 
(known in Russia as the Schnobels). 
He is not surprised by the reputation 
of British scientists in Russia. The Ig

sounding scientific work, are very

Saving holly is no walk in the park, 
says Stephanie Pain
T
EN days before Christmas, 
Romany Garnett wrapped up 
warm and set off for Quinag, a 
spectacular three-peaked mountain in 
the far north of Scotland. Several hours 
later, chilled through and battered by 
bitter winds, she headed home, her 
fingers frozen, pricked and bleeding.  
It had been a highly successful day.
Like many others at this time of year, 
Garnett was hunting for holly. Until the 
Victorians introduced the Christmas 
tree to the UK in the 19th century, the 
yuletide decoration of choice was a 
great ball of evergreens – mistletoe, ivy 
and dark, glossy holly with its scarlet 
berries. Holly was part of the country’s 
culture and folklore. Since ancient 
times, it has been a symbol of life in  
the dead of winter and a charm to ward 
off witches and other evildoers. 
It remains an indispensable part of 
Christmas – the wreath on the front 
door, the sprig atop the pudding. But  
as the John Muir Trust’s conservation 
officer for Quinag, Garnett’s interest 
lay elsewhere. On foot, with a search 
area of 3700 hectares, she set out to 
pick berries from as many hollies as 
possible, then send them south to the 
cold-storage vaults of the Millennium 
Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst. There, 
scientists working for the Royal Botanic 
Gardens, Kew, which runs the MSB, 
would extract the seeds and add them 
to millions of others as part of an 
ambitious project to safeguard Britain’s 
native trees.
The UK is one of the least wooded 
countries in Europe, with trees 
covering only 13 per cent of the land. 
Since the start of the millennium,  
there has been increasing recognition 
of their value and the need to grow 
more, but, at the same time, native 
trees have come under attack from an 
unprecedented number of pests and 
pathogens. The arrival, in 2012, of a 
fungus that kills a key species, the ash, 
put the health of the nation’s trees 
centre stage. “We know other pests are 
on their way,” says Clare Trivedi of the 
MSB. “And we also know that climate 
change will have an impact on our 
native trees and woodlands.” With  
that in mind, she and her colleagues 
decided they must take action.
The MSB already has seed from most 
of the UK’s flora safely in its vaults, but 
SUPERSTOCK

the UK National Tree Seed Project goes 
a step further: it aims to capture as 
much genetic diversity as possible. 
“Then, no matter what happens to 
individual populations, we know we 
have the genes safely in the collection,” 
says Trivedi. This approach will also 
allow researchers to investigate the 
genetics of native trees, to see which 
features differ from place to place,  
and to identify specimens that might 
be resistant to new diseases or more 
resilient in the face of climate change. 
“We don’t know what scientists might 
be looking for in future, but we can 
store seed for many decades so it will be 
there when it’s needed,” says Trivedi.
Holly hunters
Little is known about the diversity of 
most UK trees, so to build a genetically 
comprehensive collection, Trivedi 
and her colleagues want seed samples 
from the entire geographical range 
of each species. That would entail 
gathering millions of seeds from 
thousands of trees. There was only one
way to tackle such a mammoth task: 
harness the energy and enthusiasm 
of hundreds of volunteers. Ordinary 
people also helped foot the bill. The 
project has been funded largely by 
players of People’s Postcode Lottery, 
a British charity lottery.
Since 2013, teams have criss-crossed
the country collecting seeds from 
70 priority species: those at great risk,
such as the ash, rare species, such as the
Plymouth pear, and those like holly 
which are so widespread that their loss
would be catastrophic. “If something
came out of the blue that threatened 
holly, there would be a massive impact
on the landscape and on the wildlife 
that relies on holly,” says Trivedi.
Gathering tree seeds is rarely easy,
but hollies pose some particular 
challenges. Where other collectors 
work with telescopic loppers, giant 
catapults and throw lines, holly 
hunters must pick berries with their 
bare hands. “If you wear gloves, you 
just end up squashing and dropping 
the berries,” says Garnett. “You soon 
realise just how sharp the prickly leaves
are.” What’s more, late-ripening berries
mean collection must often be done in
the depths of winter, sometimes in 
atrocious conditions. And there’s an 
exhausting amount of legwork. Hollies 
once grew in dense holly woods, but 
demand for the hard, white wood for 
firewood and to make bobbins for 
weaving and teapot lids left few of 
these intact. Today, most hollies are 
dotted around mixed woodlands or 
strung out along hedgerows, while 
some older trees cling to the sides of 
steep gorges or cliff ledges, safe from 
woodcutters and browsing animals.
On the isle of Skye, in north-west 
Scotland, Sarah Lewis’s “patch” is a 
magnificent mountain called Blaven, 
where holly trees are far apart, often in 
dangerous places, and the pickings 
slim. “I climbed up to a crag where I’d 
seen holly trees with my binoculars and 
thought I’d get a good handful. When I
got there – nothing,”says Lewis, who
also works for the John Muir Trust.
Either they were males, which don’t
bear fruit, or birds had eaten the
berries. The wild island weather didn’t

life and a charm to ward 
off witches”

help either. “I’d see some holly trees at 
the start of the week and make a note to 
collect on Wednesday. By Wednesday, 
there had been a gale and the berries 
had all come off,” she says. “Sometimes 
I’d be out all day and come home 
without finding any berries.”
Hollies are surprisingly diverse. In 
Shropshire, on the Welsh borders, they 
produce berries in September, months 
earlier than elsewhere. These trees are 
part of Europe’s oldest holly grove: 
some germinated at least 400 years 
ago, when the climate was much 
colder. Scotland’s mountain hollies are 
unusually rugged, persisting despite 
frequent battering by the harshest 
winds. “The best spot for hollies on 
Quinag is a place called Allt na Doire 
Cuilinn – ‘the burn of the grove of the 
hollies’,” says Garnett. The name is 
very old, suggesting that this is also an 
ancient population of trees. Whether 
genetic differences explain their 
particular characteristics remains 
to be seen, however.
During the last ice age, hollies 
survived in geographically isolated ice-
free refuges in the Iberian peninsula 
and Italy. When the ice retreated, 
trees from these two regions – by then 
genetically distinct – migrated along 
different routes to Britain. But without 
molecular analysis, it is hard to say 
which are which, or whether there 
are populations with other origins. 
Outward appearances are an unreliable 
guide. Leaf shape, for instance, varies 
from tree to tree and place to place,  
but also on individual trees: lower 
leaves are prickly as a defence against 
browsing by deer or cattle, while those 
higher up are smooth-edged. Recent 
research reveals that hollies grow 
pricklier leaves as a result of heavier 
browsing – and that they do it by 
modifying existing genes.
Right now, teams of volunteers are 
out picking berries at sites from the 
south-west of England to the Scottish 
Highlands in a final push to bank the 
nation’s holly genes before the project 
comes to an end in March. Their efforts 
will ensure that holly remains a part 
of the UK landscape, and that there 
will always be a sprig to crown the 
Christmas pudding.  ■

TheYoungMan’sBookofAmusement,
first published by William Milner in
1839, is among the stranger relics of an
era when scientific experimentation
was starting to take off as a form of
popular entertainment. Elsewhere in
its pages, there are instructions to rub
liquid mercury on your skin, stick
explosives under a toy spider and apply
voltage to a corpse. It’s a wonder that
any of its readers survived long enough
to be amused.
Today, The Young Man’s Book of
Amusement – or, to give its full title,
The Young Man’s Book of Amusement
Containing the Most Interesting and
Instructive Experiments in Various
Branches of Science to Which Is Added
All the Popular Tricks and Changes in
Cards and the Art of Making Fire Works –
reads like a drinking game for health
and safety officials. It was a jaw-
dropping, illustrated compendium
of experiments that promised to
“unite instruction with amusement”–
and very possibly, thin out the male
gene pool.
This is a manual that recommends
everything from brewing your own
nitrous oxide to electrifying fake
heads (with real hair) until the strands
jump to attention“like quills upon the
fretful porcupine”. Pages are devoted
to exciting new hobbies, such as
restoring withered fruit, making
inflamed soap bubbles, transforming
iron into copper and freeing stuck rings
using liquid mercury. There are early
forays into meteorology involving
hand-built barometers, and a dip into
optics, with guides on how to produce
light from sugar.
At the time the book came out,
scientific experimentation was no
longer the preserve of an intellectual
elite. The wealth generated by the
industrial revolution was producing
a middle class with time on its hands
and money to splash on spending it
well. Astronomy demonstrators
toured the country with their model
solar systems, Michael Faraday’s
lectures at the Royal Institution in
London were a Christmas staple
and the first inexpensive chemistry
sets were rolled out in the 1850s by
John J. Griffin & Sons.
With literacy rates rising steeply, 
publishers were also quick to take 
advantage of this new market.  
Cheap, mass-produced educational 
texts took off. The Penny Magazine, 
published by the Society for the 
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,  
had a weekly circulation of 200,000  
in the early 1830s, its readers agog  
with curiosity about everything from 
copper mining to swordfish.
But these were tame compared  
with The Young Man’s Book of 
Amusement, which saves its most 
peculiar moment for the alarmingly 
titled “Galvanic experiments on the 
dead body of a criminal”. What follows 
goes well beyond the boundaries of 
home science, requiring the budding 
electrochemist to source a morgue,  
a hanged murderer (“middle-sized, 
athletic, extremely muscular”), 
something resembling a Leyden jar, 
and a public gallery with a fondness  
for the spectacle of a dancing corpse. 
Not all the experiments in the  
book end badly. The drowned fly, for 
example, once laid to rest in some chalk 
dust or fine ash, gets the water removed 
from the openings it uses to breathe, 
and stages a magical recovery. Just 
don't try any of this at home – or 
anywhere else for that matter.  Q

TO MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL SPIDER,
CONTAINING FULMINATING SILVER
Take about one third of a grain of fulminating silver, and 
inclose it in a piece of paper or cloth made up in the form 
of a spider, then place it in a situation where it is likely to 
be trod upon. The noise will both surprise and amuse. 
{Ed: Fulminating silver, AgCNO, though worryingly 
considered too sensitive for use in explosives, is still used 
to give some toy crackers their bang.}
THE MAGICAL TEA-SPOON
Put into a crucible four ounces of bismuth, and when in 
a state of fusion, throw in two ounces and a half of lead, 
and one ounce and a half of tin: these metals will 
combine, forming an alloy, fusible in boiling water. 
Mould the alloy into bars, and take them to a silver-
smith’s to be made into tea-spoons. Give one to a 
stranger to stir his tea, as soon as it is poured from the 
tea-pot; he will not be a little surprised to find it melt in 
his tea-cup. 
{Ed: A similar trick can also be performed with 
gallium.}
VEGETABLE CHIMNEY ORNAMENTS
In winter an elegant chimney ornament may be formed 
by cutting the head or thick end of a carrot, containing 
the bulb, and placing it in a shallow vessel with water. 
Young and delicate leaves unfold themselves, forming a 
radiated tuft of a very handsome appearance, and 
heightened by contrast with the season of the year.
INFALLIBLE ANTISEPTIC
For ensuring the sweetness of fish conveyed by land-
carriage, the belly of the fish should be opened, and the 
internal parts sprinkled with powdered charcoal. The 
same material will restore impure, or even putrescent 
water, to a state of perfect freshness.
ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION
To illuminate eggs by electricity, it is merely necessary 
to get a mahogany stand so constructed as to hold 
three eggs at a greater or smaller distance, according 
to the position of two sliding pieces of wire. A chain is 
then placed at the bottom in such a manner as to 
touch the lowest egg with one end, and with its other 
the outside coating of a charged jar. The sliding wire at 
the top is made to touch the upper egg, and the 
distance of the eggs asunder should not exceed the 
quarter or eighth part of an inch. The electricity being, 
by means of the discharging rod, sent down the ball 
and wire, will, in a darkened room, render the eggs 
luminous and transparent.
TO CAUSE A BRILLIANT EXPLOSION 
UNDER WATER
Drop a piece of phosphorus, the size of a pea, into a 
tumbler of hot water; and, from a bladder, furnished 
with a stop cock, force a stream of oxygen directly upon 
it. This will afford a most brilliant combustion under 
water.
TO GIVE A GHASTLY APPEARANCE TO 
PERSONS IN A ROOM
Dissolve salt in an infusion of saffron and spirits of 
wine. Dip some tow {Ed: Any fibres will do} in this 
solution, and having set fire to it, extinguish all the 
other lights in the room.
LIGHT PRODUCED BY SUGAR
If two pieces of loaf-sugar (about a pound each) are 
struck against each other in the dark, a light-blue flame, 
like lightning, will be elicited. The same effect takes place 
when a loaf of sugar is struck with an iron instrument.
TO KEEP A SNOW-BALL ALL SUMMER IN A 
PERFECT STATE
Get a snow-ball, and squeeze it very hard together, then 
put it in a pot and surround it well with flour, which 
must be pressed very hard about it, and you shall have as 
perfect a snow-ball in the height of summer, as you had 
when you first put it in the pot

THE YOUNG MAN’S BOOK OF AMUSEMENT

T
HERE was no rot… but suddenly 
under the magnifying lens of the 
instrument appeared an insect,  
a plant louse of yellowish colour, tight 
on the wood, sucking the sap… it is 
not one, it is not ten, but hundreds, 
thousands… They are everywhere…”
In 1868, botanist Jules-Émile 
Planchon unmasked the culprit behind 
a national crisis. For five years, a blight 
had been stealing across France’s 
vineyards. Its cause was invisible, its 
spread inexorable. Always it followed
the same pattern. First a single vine 
would wither, then a circle of plants. 
Entire vineyards were wiped out  
within years. 
Panic grew and blame flew. 
Vineyards were watered with white 
wine and pruning cuts sealed with hot
wax to halt the blight’s advance. One 
supposed cure involved burying live 
toads under the vines to draw out the
mysterious poison.
Even Planchon’s revelation couldn’t
halt the blight. Before it was finally 
stalled in the 1890s, it had laid waste 
to an estimated 40 per cent of French
vineyards, and changed the face of 
European viticulture for ever.
With the vines, scores of rural 
communes also saw their livelihoods
wither. And that’s where the story of 
the Great French Wine Blight has now
earned a second telling. Its gradual 
spread and devastating effects 
illuminate the complex relationships
between wine, poverty and crime.
The cause of the blight was the 
tiny aphid-like bug Daktulosphaira 
vitifoliae, often known as phylloxera.
Its arrival in France was the bitter fruit
of technological progress. It travelled
across the Atlantic on vines imported
from its native home in the Americas. 
Before the advent of steamships, the 
voyage was too long, and the insect 
would have died en route.
The bugs must have made landfall 
somewhere on France’s southern coast; 
the first documented case of blight 
occurred in the commune of Pujaut, 
near Avignon in the Rhone valley, in 
1863. Once they arrived in a vineyard, 
the bugs would head underground,
where they would literally suck the life
out of the vines. They depleted the
roots’sap while secreting a fluid that
stopped the plant healing, leaving the
vines vulnerable to fungal and bacterial 
infections. Beyond the reach of 
pesticides and with no native predators 
below ground, the females reproduced 
asexually with abandon, each one 
laying up to 100 clone eggs in a month. 
With four or more generations annually, 
one bug could produce more than a 
billion descendants in one year.
The nature of the blight explains 
its peculiarly destructive course, but 
also its gradual geographical spread. 
Rather than ripping across France 
within weeks as a virus might, 
D. vitifoliae moved slowly, perhaps 
transferred from vineyard to vineyard 
on the mud of itinerant workers’ 
shoes, speculates Vincent Bignon, 
an economic historian at the Bank 
of France.
In the late 19th century, agriculture 
accounted for about 30 per cent of 
France’s economic output. Wine was 
the nation’s second most important 
product after wheat. Estimates have 
put the total income shock from the 
blight as high as 15 billion francs, which 
equates to 75 per cent of one year’s 
economic output at the time. 
Those it hit had few other  sources 
of income, either. “This event affected 
people who were already at the margin 
of the economy,” says Roberto Galbiati, 
who researches economics and the law 
at Sciences Po in Paris. “Peasants and 
workers on the vines. People who didn’t 
have any other support.”
That led Bignon and Galbiati, 
together with labour market expert Eve 
Caroli of Paris Dauphine University, to 
wonder what insight the blight might 
give into the social effects of economic 
dislocation. Standard economic models 
suggest that people choose between

legal and criminal economic activities
on their relative costs and benefits.
When the income of low-skilled
workers with poor job mobility falls,
crime rates often rise, because it can be
difficult to get a job that pays enough.
“When you are poor, you have an
incentive to steal because you have
to eat,”says Bignon.
But when poverty and crime rise
in lockstep, is poverty causing crime
or crime poverty?“When there is a
lot of crime, businesses can suffer,
influencing income,”says Bignon.
Disentangling what is cause and what
is effect can often be difficult.
The slow spread of the blight
provided a natural experiment to test
these interplays, thanks to information
contained in archived yearbooks from
the French Ministry of Justice that set
out annual crime records from all
French departments throughout the
period.“Some areas were hit, some
weren’t,”says Bignon.“This allows you
to compare lots and lots of groups. The
control groups are the areas with no
disease.”
As expected, as the blight spread
to new areas, instances of property
crimes such as theft, counterfeiting
and pillaging rose. On average, these
crimes were 22 per cent higher in
districts affected by the bugs. The rise
couldn’t be explained by other factors
such as demographic changes caused
by patterns of migration.
But there was a twist. While property
crime ballooned, violent crime in the
worst affected areas slumped, by about
13 per cent on average.
This doesn’t surprise Christian
Traxler, an economist at the Hertie
School of Governance in Berlin. In 2010,
he showed a similar relationship
between a decreased supply of rye and
crime in Prussia between 1882 and 1912.
“Bad weather increased rye prices,
which induced more property crime
and fewer violent crimes,”he says.
Rye was used to make bread, but bad
weather for rye also meant bad weather
for barley, which is used to make beer.
In both the French and the Prussian
instances, Traxler thinks lack of booze
explains the drop in violent crime.
“Shock to wine production isn’t just a
shock to income, but also to wine
consumption,”he says. With less
alcohol to drink, people are less
inclined to fight. In England and

European vines onto the resistant roots 
of American plants to get the best of 
New and Old Worlds. That seemed to do 
the trick, producing excellent grapes on 
bug-resistant plants, finally halting the 
blight in the 1890s.
Some vineyards with pure European 
vines still exist in France, Spain and 
elsewhere. That’s mostly luck, says 
Alberto Acedo of Biome Makers, a 
biotech firm in San Francisco that 
develops sustainable methods to treat 
grapevine microbial diseases. These 
ancient vines, often producing feted 
and expensive wines, tend to grow  
in sandy soils, through which the 
phylloxera bug can’t disperse so  
easily, he says.  
Phylloxera eventually overcomes 
cross-bred resistance. Most recently in 
California in the 1980s and 1990s, the 
bugs caused more than $1 billion of 
damage to cross-bred vines. Now most 
vines are grafted, transatlantic mergers 
that reduce the risk of an epidemic.
At least the world is better prepared 
now. Harvests are more integrated,  
so a shortage in one place can be 
compensated by imports from another. 
Welfare systems and increased access 
to credit also help to cushion the blows 
of economic dislocation. But the story 
of the Great Blight has eerie pre-echoes 
of the recent credit crunch, says 
Bignon. Through the blight’s ravages, 
thousands of local companies, 
including banks, went bust and the 
credit system partly collapsed, 
preventing farmers from borrowing. 
In a paper Bignon co-wrote for the 
European Central Bank earlier this 
year, he shows a parallel with the recent 
bank bailouts: when French companies 
had access to a nearby branch of the 
central bank, which would take on their 
debt, it helped smooth troubles locally. 
Rural France may now have 
recovered from the effects of the  
blight, but it took a long time. Property 
crime levels remained high in wine-
dependent regions for decades,  
and the blight lives on in the collective 
memory, in tales of families uprooted 
and livelihoods ruined. “There are 
many family stories of upheaval a few 
generations ago,” says Bignon. For good 
and ill, though, the wine returned.  Q
Chris Simms is blighted by the bottle
“Theideaofreplacingthe
vines with supposedly 
inferior American imports 
was summarily dismissed”
Some 150 years after the Great 
French Wine Blight (see main story), 
European vines are under threat 
from another disease that originated 
in the Americas. A bacterium known 
as Xylella fastidiosa causes Pierce’s 
disease, in which the plants’ 
transport vessels become blocked, 
cutting the supply of water and 
nutrients to the leaves.  
California’s Department of Food and 
Agriculture spends about $40 million 
a year to control the leaf-hopping 
insects known as sharpshooters that 
carry the bacteria from plant to plant 
in that region. Without that outlay, the 
annual cost to the wine industry could 
be northwards of $250 million, says 
Alberto Acedo of biotech firm Biome 
Makers in San Francisco.
NOT SO FASTIDIOUS
The bacterium doesn’t just hit 
vines – in the Americas it also strikes 
citrus and coffee plants. Now X. 
fastidiosa has reached Europe,  
where it has earned another name 
– the “Ebola of olive trees”. In 2013,  
it was spotted in a few olive trees  
in southern Italy, and by 2015 had 
infected up to a million trees there 
with what has become known as olive 
quick decline syndrome, causing 
withering, desiccation and death. That 
same year, the blight reached Corsica 
and mainland France, and since then 
Germany as well as Spain, the world’s 
largest producer of olives according to 
the International Olive Council. 
So far, 359 plant species in Europe 
have been identified as being 
vulnerable to X. fastidiosa, including 
peaches, sycamore, lavender and 
rosemary. Some show no symptoms, 
acting as reservoirs for the bacteria. 
Others wither quickly. Short of 
controlling insect species that could 
spread the various strains, no cure is 
yet known.
Generally cold winters slow the 
spread of Pierce’s disease in the US. 
That might mean northern Europe will 
escape unscathed. But as the planet 
warms, there is every chance the 
disease’s ranges could change or 
increase. “Some say there is a 
relationship between climate change 
and the increasing virulence of Xylella 
fastidiosa strains,” says Acedo.

Wales today, for instance, alcohol 
consumption is thought to contribute 
to 1.2 million violent incidents a year. 
“Alcohol consumption makes people 
more impulsive, less restrained,”  
says Bignon.
It took a long time for the underlying 
cause of this economic dislocation to be 
overcome, even after Planchon had 
unmasked the malefactor, and it 
came at a significant price to French 
exceptionalism. American varieties  
of vine had always existed alongside 
phylloxera, and were able to survive the 
blight. The idea of replacing European 
vines, which include varieties like Pinot 
Noir, Chardonnay and Merlot, with 
supposedly inferior American imports 
was summarily dismissed. Instead, 
vine growers tried cross-breeding two 
varieties or grafting the stems of

N THE millennia before street lights 
and smartphones, humans could,  
on rare occasions, walk around on a 
moonless night and see clearly. Looking 
up, they could see broad luminous 
patches of light stretching across the 
sky, which brightened the heavens in 
all directions as though it were daylight. 
People could read without candlelight, 
view small details in their surroundings, 
and make out landscapes in the distance. 
It was as if the world were illuminated 
by a hidden night-time sun.
The existence of bright nights is well 
accepted, but their cause remains a 
mystery. Frustratingly, sightings 
have almost entirely faded away in 
the past few decades, making it seem 
that any hope of solving the riddle was 
dimming. Now, though, one man says 
he has seen the solution.
The earliest account of a bright night 
comes from Pliny the Elder, a Roman 
army commander who studied nature 
in his spare time. In his encyclopaedic 
Natural History of around AD 77, 
he wrote that the “phenomenon 
commonly called a nocturnal sun… a 
light emanating from the sky at night” 
has been seen many times. In 1988, a 
French atmospheric scientist named 
Michel Hersé produced the definitive 
collection of accounts of bright nights, 
which documented similar stories 
from the past millennium and all over 
the world. In French, they were nuit 
claires, and in German helle Nächte. 
But sightings have become rarer.  
The most recent may be from 22 
and 23 August 2001 at the Leoncito 
Astronomical Complex high in the 
Argentinian Andes. During that event, 
Steven Smith of Boston University in 
Massachusetts and his colleagues 
reported a night sky that was 10 times 
brighter than normal. 
There is an obvious reason why the 
frequency of reported bright nights 
might have fallen: it has to be dark for 
us to notice them, and these days, 
99 per cent of people in Europe and 
North America sleep under an 
artificially lit sky. 
Hersé’s book suggests that about one 
bright night used to be observed every 
year, but aside from that reveals no 
obvious temporal or geographical 
pattern. “I think you would have to 
have been in the right place at the  
right time, and in the right situation,  
to see one,” says John Barentine, an 
astronomer at the International Dark-
Sky Association, which works to 
combat light pollution.
Luminous smog
However, Barentine points to an 
interesting clue buried in 19th-century 
accounts. These frequently include a 
description of a “luminous smog” in 
the air. Astronomers and maritime 
observers said the effect was distinct 
from auroras or the faint nocturnal 
glow known as the zodiacal light, a 
pyramid shaped brightness produced 
when space dust reflects sunshine 
coming from below the horizon. This 
suggests there might be some sort of 
reflective haze hanging in the upper 
atmosphere. 
Perhaps that could have been dust 
from volcanoes or meteors, says 
Barentine. Take the account of a diarist 
we know only as M. Toucher, writing 
near Paris on 30 June 1908. It is possibly 
no coincidence that this was the day of 
the Tunguska event, when a huge space 
rock exploded in the upper atmosphere 
over Siberia. People around the world 
reported a haze in the atmosphere for 
months afterwards, and light reflecting 
from the haze might explain why 
Toucher could write: “At 22.30… Very
clear sky, full of stars which shine to

the horizon. No moonlight. All the 
details of the landscape are visible.”
Despite Toucher’s observation 
during a night when there was no 
moonlight, some have wondered 
whether bright nights could simply  
be cloudless nights with a full moon 
and bright stars. However, in 1909 L. 
Yntema, a doctoral student at the 
University of Groningen in the 
Netherlands settled that question. 
After measuring the total amount of 
light from all the stars reaching Earth’s 
surface, he found a discrepancy in the 
light on bright nights. That seemed to 
point to some sort of atmospheric 
phenomenon as their cause. Yntema 
called it “Earthlight”.
Rolling on the waves
So, are we sure that this isn’t just a rare, 
mid-latitude aurora? That possibility
was ruled out by Robert Strutt, son and
heir to Lord Rayleigh, a physicist who, 
among other things, had discovered 
that the way gas molecules scatter light 
explains why the sky looks blue. The 
younger Rayleigh witnessed a bright 
night on 8 November 1929, and
demonstrated that the light came
from all directions. In an aurora, it 
typically comes in streaks.
Today bright nights may have all  
but vanished, but we do have certain
advantages over Rayleigh – satellites,
for example. In the late 1980s, Gordon
Shepherd of York University in Toronto,
Canada, built a satellite instrument
called WINDII, which could monitor
waves of air as they rolled through
the atmosphere. He soon found that
these waves could pile up on top of
one another to produce towers of 
pressurised air.
Along with the waves, Shepherd also 
studies how the chemical make-up of 
the atmosphere changes through the 
day. During daylight hours, ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun splits molecular 
oxygen into individual atoms. When 
the sun goes down, the atoms rejoin.
This produces a small amount of light,
called airglow. 
Airglow is usually barely visible with
the naked eye from Earth’s surface,  
but looking at WINDII readings, which
spanned from 1991 to 2004, Shepherd 
noticed the airglow emissions varied 
wildly from night to night, and from 
place to place.
Earlier this year, it occurred to him 
that air waves and airglow could be 
connected. The waves might force the 
oxygen into a higher concentration, he 
thought, creating a more intense glow 
that could explain bright nights. “I don’t 
know why it came to me, but I said, ‘ 
Ah, that’s the explanation’,” he says.
To verify his suspicion, Shepherd 
first had to account for the sun’s 
activity, which can affect the brightness 
of airglow too. He and his colleague 
Young-Min Cho went back through 
WINDII data for 1992 and 1996, when 
the sun’s activity was at different levels. 
Cho wrote an algorithm that could 
search the data, discard any nights 
when there was an aurora and find 
times when waves might have piled up 
enough to produce a bright night. For 
both years, that analysis showed that 
the waves could have produced a bright 
night about 7 per cent of the time at any 
given spot on Earth. 
That convinced them that the action
of the waves was a greater influence
on the airglow than increased solar 
activity. But it also indicated that you
would get about 25 bright nights a
year, which doesn’t tally with Hersé’s 
collected accounts. However, further 
analysis showed that stacked waves and 
“Unlike an aurora coming
in streaks, the light on  
a bright night comes  
from all directions”

Chocolate is the world’s favourite
treat: globally, we eat 7 million tonnes
of the stuff a year, and demand is rising
as Asian consumers develop a taste for
it, too. Yet supply is far from assured.
Most of the world’s commercial cocoa
plants originate from just a few clones
made in the 1940s, which have so far
proven productive enough to keep up
with demand. But this has led to a
dangerous lack of genetic diversity,
leaving cocoa vulnerable to a host of
pests and diseases that love cocoa as
much as we do. Some 30 to 40 per cent
of the crop is lost to disease each year,
and there are fears that climate change
might exacerbate the problem.
The drive to breed new cocoa
varieties that are more productive, as
well as hardy and pest-resistant, means
sending specimens around the world,
which risks spreading disease and
making matters worse. That’s why since
1985 the vast majority of cocoa samples
being transported to distant regions
have made a two-year pit stop.
“Reading is the hub these days for
the international movement of cocoa,”
says Andrew Daymond, not a little
proudly. A plant physiologist at the
University of Reading, he is in charge
of cocoa quarantining.
Entering the tent, I am transported to
the tropics. A wall of heat and humidity
hits me, plus the striking sight of
hundreds of 2-metre-tall plants, lush
and green, some with large orange or
red pods hanging from their trunks.

a cloud-free night are not very likely  
to coincide at any given spot, reducing 
the expected frequency. “I think that’s 
pretty consistent with the historical 
record,” says Shepherd. 
Shepherd, now 86 and retired, 
hasn’t been able to link any of the 
suitably stacked waves with eyewitness 
reports of bright nights, partly because 
modern reports are so rare. To do so 
would be a neat confirmation, though, 
so he is looking into crowdsourcing a 
bright night. “You could get together 
500 to 1000 people via the web 
and cover different longitudes and 
potentially all nights of the year,” he 
says. Enough to brighten someone’s 
night, anyway.  ■

seeds nestled inside. The seeds are
bitter, with only a hint of a chocolately
taste. It is only when they and the pulp
are fermented, and the seeds dried and
roasted, that the characteristic 
toothsome flavour begins to emerge.
“Why Reading?” I ask. It is a world 
away from the tropical forests of South 
America where cocoa naturally grows. 
That’s exactly the point, says Daymond. 
If a pathogen should escape, it wouldn’t 
survive long in the temperate UK 
climate and there are no crops from 
its native land for it to infect.
In quarantine, Daymond and his 
team are on the look out for pod-
rotting fungal diseases such as witches’ 
broom and the festive-sounding frosty 
pod, both of which spread easily. In  
the 1990s, witches’ broom devastated 
cocoa production in the state of Bahia 
in Brazil, after spores were brought in 
from the Amazon region, perhaps 
deliberately. The output from the Bahia
region plummeted by 75 per cent. So 
far, neither disease has reached West 
Africa, where most of the world’s 
cocoa is now grown. There, they have 
different problems: the bug-borne 
disease swollen shoot virus, which kills
cocoa trees within a few years, and 
mirid bugs, which feed on the pods, 
slashing yields by up to 40 per cent.
Cocoa samples arrive in Reading as 
budwood: a short stick with a number 
of active buds sprouting on it. Around 
30 new varieties turn up each year, 
some of them wild plants from 
rainforest expeditions. On arrival, the 
samples are inspected for obvious signs
of insect stowaways. Buds are then 
grafted on to seedlings to establish
a mother plant. To check for less
conspicuous problems, buds from
the mother plant are also grafted on
to seedlings of an “indicator” plant,  
a variety of cocoa that shows disease 
symptoms more clearly than most.  
If viruses or other diseases are present 
in a sample that comes in, the 
symptoms will eventually develop. 
After two years, the team can be 
confident that any dormant viruses 
will have shown up, and the plant is 
deemed safe. Genetic tests under 
development at the University of 
Reading could offer a way to speed up 
the quarantine process, but Daymond 
says he is not yet certain these tests can 
pick up all of the viruses.
When the cocoa plants are certified 
disease-free, cuttings are sent to 
researchers around the world. One

For decades, he has been painstakingly 
mixing promising strains to create 
hybrids that are screened for disease 
resistance. “We are refreshing the blood 
of cocoa,” says Phillips-Mora. One new 
variety he has developed, CATIE R6, not 
only shows remarkable resistance to 
frosty pod, but also delivers a huge 
boost in productivity. The chocolate 
icing on the cake was when it was 
commended in the International Cocoa 
Awards in 2009 for its taste and aroma.
Quite a hill of beans
New varieties such as CATIE R6 are sent 
to researchers in other nations to be 
hybridised with the native crop and 
rolled out to farmers. In West Africa in 
particular, where many plantations are 
reaching the end of their productive 
life, this new blood is sorely needed.
The quarantine greenhouse is large 
enough to cover four tennis courts, and 
much of it is filled with plants that have 
already received the all-clear – 400 
different varieties. Plants still under 
quarantine are housed separately. 
Has anyone made chocolate from  
the Reading crop, I ask Daymond, 
hopefully. “It’s not something we’ve 
tried,” he says. “You need a large heap 
of beans to do a proper fermentation  
of cocoa beans, and we don’t get huge 
numbers of pods here.”
Undeterred, when I get home,  
I decide to give it a go. I put the contents 
of the single cocoa pod that Daymond 
gave me into the most tropical 
conditions I can find, next to the hot 
water tank. First I need to let the pulp 
ferment into an alcoholic liquid to 
break down the astringent compounds 
in the seeds. Then I can dry and roast 
the seeds in the oven. Easy. Or not, as it 
turned out. After a few days, I found 
myself with a handful of black, mouldy 
beans and an aroma that was anything 
but delicious.

OU can tell yourself you haven’t 
been too naughty over the  
festive season. You may even be 
able to convince others. But whether  
it’s an extra portion of Christmas 
pudding, too many glasses of wine or 
even the odd cigarette, the proof of 
your indulgences may be lurking 
somewhere altogether more 
surprising – inside your ears. 
Earwax can easily be dismissed as  
a little gross and something to get rid 
of, but we are fast discovering that 
it is more than just another bodily 
secretion. All sorts of secrets about you 
are collected in it. With enough detailed 
probing of the stuff, says Katherine 
Prigge of fragrance company Symrise, 
based in Marlow, UK, it is possible that 
earwax could be used to reveal not only 
someone’s identity, “but information 
about where they’ve been, what they’ve 
eaten and what they were exposed to”. 
From drug tests to disease diagnosis, 
the potential of its unique chemical 
signature is starting to be put to good 
use. It may even give us answers about 
the lives of other animals who can’t tell 
us for themselves. 
More formally, the glop in your  
ears is called cerumen, and it is made 
up of the secretions of the ceruminous 
glands – specialised sweat glands – 
and sebaceous glands in the outer 
ear canal. Most of these are waxy 
compounds, which clean the ear canal 
and protect it from drying out, as well 
as killing bacteria and trapping foreign 
bodies like dust and fungal spores. 
Mixed into that wax are bodily cast-offs 
like shed skin cells and hair, alongside 
potent antimicrobials and other 
chemicals. 
It is these other chemicals – the 
leftovers of cellular processes and 
traces of substances you have been 
exposed to – that, we are now starting 
to realise, contain a surprising  
amount of intel about you. 
For the past few years, Engy Shokry 
at the Federal University of Goiás in 
Goiânia, Brazil, and her colleagues 
have been doing some pioneering 
experiments to test whether earwax 
can be used as a forensic or diagnostic 
tool. As well as being able to extract 
plain old DNA from it, they have used 
earwax to detect drug and tobacco use 
and diagnose both types of diabetes.
One advantage of earwax over  
other samples like blood or urine is  
that collection is more straightforward 
and less invasive. “Just asking a patient 
for a cotton swab in their ear is much 
easier than asking to draw blood,” says 
Shokry. To ensure they get enough, 
they ask that volunteers don’t clean 
inside their ears (a practice discouraged 
by doctors anyway – earwax should 
just fall out naturally) for a week 
beforehand. “We can get 20 milligrams, 
which is more than enough for our 
tests,” she says. And earwax needs little, 
if any, processing to be analysed. “It 
takes around a tenth of the preparation 
time of other kinds of samples.”
Earwax factor
It has other advantages, too. “Because 
earwax builds up over time, you can 
look back and get more information,” 
says Prigge; blood and urine only 
give a “snapshot of what’s going on in 
your body at this moment.” In the lab, 
Shokry has shown that tests on earwax 
can detect drugs up to three months 
after they were taken, provided the 
patient hasn’t been meticulously 
Q-tipping. This means we can use it for 
both short and long-term monitoring
of some substances, she says.

compounds from the wax directly:
valuable information can be gathered
by smell alone.“It’s definitely not the
most pleasant smell,”says Prigge,
who spent years getting acquainted
with it.“It’s kind of acidic and pungent.
There are also some faecal notes to it…
and a goat-like odour.”
We already knew that there are two
types of earwax – and that which kind
you have is linked to ethnicity (see
“Divided by earwax”, left). But Prigge
has also identified about a dozen
different volatile compounds present
in earwax at levels that vary with
ethnicity – and since these substances
make up smells, a person’s ancestry
could be partly deciphered using the
scent of their earwax.
These findings are just the tip of the
iceberg in terms of what information
the stuff may hold. Some of the most
incredible discoveries have come not
from humans, but from the giant
plugs removed from whales. These
help to transmit acoustic vibrations
underwater, and are another ball of
wax altogether.“We had one particular
earplug that was 50 centimetres long
and weighed about 2 pounds,”says
Stephen Trumble, a marine mammal
physiologist at Baylor University in
Texas.“And you can imagine the smell.”
The wax plugs are often collected
and kept in museums alongside bones
and such because they are used to
determine age. With whale ears largely
sealed off from the outside, the earwax
compacts over time into layers.“You
can cut it in half and count the rings,
like a tree,”Trumble says.
The other details Trumble and his
colleagues can glean by carefully
sampling and analysing the layers is
astounding, ranging from DNA to
hormones. In their most recent, as
yet unpublished, work they looked at
20 earplugs with about 1100 layers 
between them and were able to connect 
high levels of stress hormones such as 
cortisol with historical whaling activity. 
“The data are kind of unprecedented,” 
he says. “To be able to show a tight 
correlation between 20th-century 
DIVIDED BY EARWAX
Next time a lump of earwax falls 
out of your ear, what do you see: 
flaky, whitish-yellow stuff or sticky, 
orange-brown goop? The difference  
is down to a single gene: ABCC11. 
Dry, flaky earwax is most common 
in people of East Asian descent. 
A change in just a single DNA base 
pair in the ABCC11 gene encodes for 
the “wet” kind, most often found 
in people of African or European 
descent. The difference isn’t just 
cosmetic. The same gene is also 
responsible for variation in 
underarm odour: people with 
dry earwax stink less.
And we are just beginning to 
understand what the ABCC11 protein 
does in the body. Some forms of it 
are associated with more aggressive 
tumours, whereas the dry earwax 
variant could make some tumours 
more sensitive to chemotherapy. 
So eventually, earwax could help 
determine a person’s prognosis if 
they are diagnosed with cancer.

LYING a state-of-the-art drone  
over a home to spy on its owners’ 
taste in decor is usually frowned 
on. Fabrizio Sergio and his team, 
however, had a good excuse. The homes
in question were nests belonging to  
birds of prey called black kites. Their 
decoration style? Tatty white plastic 
bags. In some cases, lots of them, 
making the nests as conspicuous as a 
reindeer on your front lawn or a plastic
Santa climbing onto the roof. 
Sergio, at the Doñana Biological 
Station in Seville, Spain, wanted to 
answer a question that had puzzled 
him and other biologists for 
decades – why would a bird decorate its
nest with conspicuous tat? This kind of
flamboyant adornment would be likely
to attract predators to vulnerable eggs 
and chicks, harming a bird’s chances of
passing on its genes – hardly a trait that
would be favoured by natural selection.
It might seem odd to talk about nests
in terms of natural selection: after all, 
they aren’t part of a bird’s body, which

whaling and stress in whales – you 
could never ever in a million years do 
that without earplugs.”
Whales aren’t the only mammals 
whose ears offer clues to their past. 
In one experiment on cattle earwax, 
Shokry detected fluoroacetate, a poison 
US farmers use against coyotes, and 
one that is hard to identify in other 
biological fluids, meaning diagnoses 
of accidental cattle poisoning are 
currently only made using symptoms 
and the animal’s history. She hopes this 
will improve diagnoses. 
We hear ewe
Shokry has shown that changes in 
ewe earwax relate to pregnancy and 
lactation too. Since earwax requires no 
veterinary experience to collect, this 
could offer a simple, cheap way to 
check up on farm animals, and one 
that would be less stressful for them. 
Shokry is also soon to publish a study 
on spotting cancer using dog earwax.
But for all the promise earwax shows 
as a diagnostic tool, it could be some 
time before it reaches the clinic. We 
have centuries of data about what 
blood and urine samples should look 
like, but little on earwax, says Craig 
Wheelock at the Karolinska Institute  
in Sweden, who looks at molecular 
signatures of disease. “Earwax is an 
open book, so to speak – for good and 
bad.” And although careful analysis  
can tell us a lot about what someone 
has been up to, the sheer diversity in 
earwax makes it hard to know what 
anomalies look like. “Normalising it  
so that earwax is earwax is earwax will 
be a challenge,” Wheelock says. 
That said, we have overcome similar 
challenges before. “We’ve been working 
this field for 15 years and we’ve done 
over 300 different types of sample,” 
says Mike Milburn at Metabolon, a firm 
based in North Carolina that profiles 
biological markers. In principle, there 
is no reason why you wouldn’t get a 
good representation of important 
biomarkers in earwax, he says. 
But for now, any confidential 
information will stay archived in your 
ear where nobody can get at it. The 
perfect excuse for another brandy.  Q

is the obvious product of its genes. But 
35 years ago, biologist Richard Dawkins 
suggested that a gene’s influence could 
reach beyond the body that houses  
it and manipulate its environment –  
a phenomenon he called the extended 
phenotype. Structures built by 
animals, such as beaver dams and 
birds’ nests, are a good example.
Extended phenotypes should 
help, not hinder, reproduction. Take 
the eye-catching work of the male 
bowerbird, which builds grass tunnels 
and litters them with stones, glass and 
plastic to court mates. Males with the 
most pleasing bowers mate with more 
females. But bowers never contain eggs 
and can be abandoned if their gaudiness 
catches the attention of predatory eyes.
More discreet nest adornments 
are also known to have reproductive 
benefits. Some bird species incorporate 
aromatic plants and even cigarette 
butts to repel parasites, while others
tuck feathers or fresh greenery inside
to attract mates.

Mainwaring, who studies nests at 
Lancaster University, UK. Sergio’s  
kite study in particular has sparked 
renewed interest in the field, and 
ecologists now think nests have a 
number of functions beyond safely 
cradling a brood, says Mainwaring.
And it seems these birds aren’t alone. 
In a slightly revolting twist on the 
technique, burrowing owls decorate 
their nests with clods of cow or horse 
dung that are neither too fresh nor too 
old. Finding out why makes for icky 
research. “It’s not a popular task for 
students when you tell them they’ve 
got to go out and collect garbage cans 
full of manure and then go and scatter 
it around nests,” says behavioural 
ecologist Courtney Conway at the 
University of Arizona.
But it is not just the choice of 
decorations that is odd. If ever a bird 
ought to keep its home under wraps, 
Burrowing owls 
adorn their nests 
with manure and 
other decorations 
to deter intruders
But what about the kites? These birds
have a long history of adding human-
made objects to their nests, including 
smalls pilfered from washing lines,  
a habit noted by Shakespeare in The 
Winter’s Tale. “Everywhere you study 
them, it catches your attention that in 
those nests you find all this rubbish 
and strange materials,” Sergio says.  
The showy displays favoured by black 
kites are hard to explain, particularly 
because both sexes are involved in nest
building. To find out more, Sergio and 
his team turned to a dense population
containing 500 breeding pairs in the 
Doñana National Park. 
This group is exceptionally well-
studied: the team knew the age, body 
size, condition and migratory history 
of many individuals. This meant they 
could link the birds’ decorating 
behaviour to aspects of their biology 
such as their survival and reproduction,
and their place in the social hierarchy, 
which reflects a bird’s ability to defend
its territory from competitors. These 
hierarchies establish which are the 
strongest birds, to prevent them 
wasting energy engaging in conflicts 
they are unlikely to win. 
Doñana’s breeding pairs each have  
a nest in a tree that they will fiercely 
defend, along with a small surrounding
territory. Territories closest to the 
communal hunting ground are highly
coveted and occupied by the strongest,
most dominant birds. Weaker, lower-
status kites occupy poorer territories, 
and some find themselves nestless. 
“Their only chance to get a territory  
is to usurp it,” says Sergio. 
Curiously, the team found that  
the most decorated nests suffered the 
fewest attacks from nestless birds. These
belonged to individuals in their physical
prime, ones that had the best territories
and were the most dominant. This 
suggested that the decorations were  
a signal of the physical strength and 
social status of the resident, and an 
“honest” one at that – it wasn’t that 
weaker birds were gaming the system 
by adding plastic too. And these signals
were heeded by other kites. 
Those with highly decorated nests 
also raised more young, possibly 
because their homes deterred attacks 
and food theft – a clear reproductive 
benefit of decoration. 
What stops birds cheating the 
system? To find out, the team added 
extra white plastic to the nests of 
low-status birds to see how the others 
would react. These nests experienced 
an upsurge in intrusions from other 
kites that the residents found hard 
to repel, revealing a social control to 
enforce honesty. “There are individuals 
that are constantly checking a subset  
of nests,” says Sergio. “And when they 
see a change in the decoration, they 
come to check that you are not lying.” 
Intriguingly, the birds had strong 
decor taste preferences, opting for 
white plastic over the green or 
transparent stuff the team left out for 
them. What’s more, weaker, low-status 
birds quickly removed any extra white 
plastic the team placed in their nests. 
“They had very clear ideas of what they 
wanted in the nest in terms of plastic,” 
says Sergio. “I wouldn’t say ‘conscious’, 
but surely it’s a decision that they take.”
Cool decorations
Why the preference for white? Sergio 
wondered whether it helped the kites 
resolve a trade-off between keeping  
the nest sufficiently shaded from the 
sun to keep it cool, and making it 
visible to flying birds. White would 
certainly stand out against green 
canopy. “It was very compatible with a 
message towards the sky,” says Sergio.
Last summer, he and his team 
published the results of the study in 
which they flew a camera drone over 
experimental nests in Doñana, to see 
how the plastic affected visibility. 
Human volunteers shown the 
images were quicker to spot decorated 
nests, even from great heights.  
So the plastic clearly made the nests 
conspicuous – probably more so to  
the razor-sharp eyes of a roaming kite.
Biologists had previously seen 
a handful of examples of species’ 
extended phenotypes being used as a 
signal to other individuals, but these 
were almost always related to getting 
a mate. The kind of status-signalling 
nest decorations displayed by the kites 
was new and suggested that nests were 
more complex than generally believed. 
“Up until about 10 years ago, people 
thought nests were boring, and not 
worthy of much attention,” says Mark

it’s this one. Burrowing owls nest 
underground, some in holes they dig
for themselves, others in abandoned
animal burrows. These usually have 
only one entrance and no emergency
exit to flee hungry coyotes and badgers,
looking for tasty eggs or nestlings. 
Instead of being discreet, the owls 
decorate their nests with abandon – 
strewing the entrance with manure and
other items such as moss, grass, plastic,
paper and aluminium foil. Males stand
guard, motionless, puffing themselves
up to full height if they spot a potential
threat. “They appear to be trying to 
stand out,” says Conway.
For many years, ecologists assumed
the manure masked the scent of the 
burrow and so made it harder for 
predators to find. But in 2004, a team
led by Douglas Levey at the University
of Florida showed that the manure 
offered little camouflage. Instead, it 
acted as bait for the owls’ main prey: 
dung beetles. This made it one of the 
few examples of wild birds using tools. 
Yet it may not be the whole story. 
Conway and his team had also shown
that the owls’ manure decorating 
behaviour trapped insects. But this 
didn’t explain why some individuals
were garlanding their burrows with 
other materials. Burrows can be in 
short supply and attract the attention
of single males looking for somewhere
to nest. Resident males attack and 
usually see off any intruders. Could the
owls, like black kites, be using a signal
to avoid conflict?
To find out, Conway’s team scattered
manure around unoccupied test
burrows at the start of the breeding
season, and discovered that owls
visited these less often than test
burrows without manure. They then
placed a stuffed owl near real occupied
nests to see how their owners would
react. Not only did the males vigorously
attack the stuffed intruder, they
immediately fortified their burrows
with more manure, as if they felt the
need to boost their signals.
Seeing how owls behaved when
manure was removed proved difficult:
the owls replaced it as fast as the
researchers could take it away.
“They work overtime to thwart our
experiments,”says Conway.“That told
us there was a function to having that
manure around the entrance to the
burrow – it wasn’t just that they were
poor housekeepers.”
Intriguingly, about half the burrows
the team studied were also decorated
with other materials, which the owls
were just as quick to replace if removed.
And given a choice, owls didn’t
specifically seek out manure, instead
favouring materials that were closest
to hand. Conway can’t rule out the
possibility that other materials
somehow attract insects, although
he thinks the signalling hypothesis is
the most plausible one.
Another bird, the diminutive  
rock sparrow, seems to have a similar 
signalling motivation behind its 
decorating behaviour. Many birds 
line their nests with feathers, possibly 
to keep eggs at the right temperature. 
But Matteo Griggio at the University 
of Padova in Italy and his team 
noticed that rock sparrows stacked 
feathers on the rim of their nest like 
hunting trophies.
When the team added extra 
feathers, these altered nests 
experienced fewer intrusions, and 
were defended more vigorously by 
their occupants. This suggests that  
the decorations, like those of the black 
kites, are a signal to deter competitors. 
What’s more, resident females laid 
more eggs than those in unaltered nests, 
and their male partners defended the 
nest more, and were less likely to 
abandon it. Female rock sparrows are 
the nest decorators, so Griggio’s team 
speculates that it is a way for a female to 
signal her quality to a male, persuading 
him to stick around after mating and 
invest more effort in raising their 
brood. This would make it a rare 
example of sexual selection favouring 
an ornament on females – the ornament 
being outsourced to the nest. 
The closer ecologists look, the more 
they are realising that nests aren’t just  
a safe home for offspring, but can also 
work as an extension of the body – like 
a puffed-up chest to see off rivals,  
or a head crest that attracts a mate. 
If only they could be aware of it, birds 
might preen themselves to know that 
science proves their taste in decor to be 
a sign of great sophistication.  Q

ORGET Christmas; I’m dreaming  
of a white February. Seven days  
of natural snowfall, that’s all I’m 
asking for while I’m on holiday. Call me 
a snob if you like, but artificial snow just 
doesn’t cut it on the slopes. It feels like 
tiny glass beads under my skis, it’s 
heavy, and it doesn’t move or pack or 
stick like the real stuff does. 
But we have to be realistic. Reliably 
snowy Alpine winters are a thing of the 
past. Our greenhouse gas emissions, 
including those piling up from flights 
to Geneva or Boulder, have made sure 
of that. With global temperatures 1.1°C 
above where they were on average at 
the end of the 19th century and still 
on the rise, the smart money is on 
learning to love fake snow or else 
trading in those ski boots for a pair  
of walking shoes. 
Unless, of course, we can engineer 
our way out of the problem. A new 
generation of snow-making machines 
is promising to create artificial stuff 
that is as good as the real thing, and 
uses less energy and water to boot. 
Goodbye grainy fake snow, 
hello year-round fluffy powder. 
Could this be the answer to all our 
middle-class winter woes? 
As anyone who has ever had their 
skiing holiday ruined by a dry spell 
will know, real snow can be capricious. 
The temperature and humidity have 
to be just right for any droplets of mist 
that bump up against airborne dust 
particles to crystallise upon contact. 
And the two must meet high in the 
sky to give the budding crystals time – 
as they fall – to form the delicate, 
interconnected branches we 
associate with snowflakes. It is the air 
trapped in this branched structure 
that gives powder snow its signature 
fluffy finish.
When natural conditions aren’t  
quite right, ski resorts have a few tricks 
to spur things along. The most effective 
is using snow machines that pump 
water and air out of a nozzle at high 
pressure. As the air expands, it loses 
energy, causing a localised drop in 
temperature. That freezes the pumped 
water droplets to create tiny airborne 
ice particles.
These frozen snow seeds are blown 
high, giving them a little more air time 
to knock up against a mist of larger 
droplets also pumped out by the snow 
guns. When the two meet, the outside 
of the larger droplets freezes into a hard

shell, and an artificial snow “flake”  
is born. Rather than forming delicate
branches, however, these are more like
tiny grains of sand, often with a liquid
centre as the inside generally doesn’t
have enough time to freeze.
While this ersatz snow may  
sound unappealing, engineer  
Fabian Wolfsperger at TechnoAlpin, 
one of Europe’s large snow-making 
companies, believes there are some 
upsides. For one thing, it is harder and
denser than the real stuff. It is also 
more homogeneous and packs well 
into a smooth, even piste. “Those kinds
of conditions are what professional 
skiers are after: they need snow that 
will resist their hard turns, not just  
fluff away,” he says. 
This fake snow is also good for very
steep slopes, where powder is more 
likely to lead to avalanches, and for 
giving resorts a solid snow base at  
the beginning of the season. This is 
becoming more and more important
as temperatures rise. The last few  
years have seen very dry weather in 
November and December in Europe, 
and climate models tell us to expect 
increasingly erratic conditions. Most
resorts make their money between 
Christmas and New Year, so being  
able to make a lot of snow on cold  
days early in the winter is key. 
Perhaps it is because I am not  
a professional skier, but I find 
Wolfsperger’s argument tough to 
swallow. An alternative, so-called 
nature-identical snow, sounds far  
more appealing. The idea is to produce
snowflakes with a classic branched 
structure and powdery feel. 
One method involves running a flow
of cold air over a basin of hot water 
inside a closed chamber. The cold air 
becomes supersaturated with water 
vapour, and is blown into a second,  
cold chamber that is criss-crossed with
nylon threads. Ice crystals form on the
threads and grow in a typical branching
fashion until they are shaken off into a
drawer below. 
The snowflakes are lovely, but the 
technique can’t replace traditional 
snow-making, says Martin Schneebeli
of WSL Institute for Snow and 
Avalanche Research SLF in Switzerland.
Schneebeli uses the snow to learn 
about the physics of avalanches in the
lab, but the quantities produced in
this way are too small to coat a piste.
Michael Bacher of Neuschnee, a
company based in Austria, thinks he
has found a happy medium. Bacher’s
idea combines parts of traditional
artificial snow-making with the closed
chamber approach.“We are producing
high-quality snow, targeting a niche
market in the winter tourism industry,”
he says.
Slippery slope
Instead of spraying ice nuclei into the
open air, he puts them into a tent-like
space with air tuned to hold more water
than would be possible under normal
conditions, with over 100 per cent
humidity. This triggers crystallisation
on the free-floating ice nuclei.
Flakes grow bigger and bigger in this
engineered environment, just as in
the sky, until they are either blown out
the top of the chamber or pulled out
through a pipe at the bottom to be
distributed on the mountain.
Neuschnee’s method can’t yet
handle large resorts. But if it can make
the upgrade, it promises to have one
further advantage over traditional
snow-making: it uses less water per

cubic metre of snow formed. With 
traditional fake snow, some of the 
water droplets that are sprayed into  
the air evaporate. Two recent studies – 
one French and one Austrian – have 
found that between 15 and 40 per cent 
of pumped water is lost to evaporation 
during snow-making, reducing the 
efficiency of the technique. 
That can be a problem in high 
mountain regions where water is 
already at a premium, particularly with 
the seasonal pressures of the tourism 
industry. Large resorts address this by 
building water storage, says Auden 
Schendler, vice president of 
sustainability at Aspen mountain 
resort in Colorado. “This has several 
benefits,” he says. “It allows you to fill 
reservoirs during peak flow, which is 
least damaging to ecosystems. And it 
means you’ve decoupled from streams 
or rivers at low periods, so you are not 
stressing them.”
By switching to more efficient snow-
making methods, resorts could see 
their water and energy bills melt  
away, shrinking their environmental 
footprint in the process. But fake snow 
is unlikely ever to be without impact. 
“Unfortunately, in response to climate 
change, resorts are expanding snow-
making, which is like throwing gasoline 
on a fire,” says Schendler. The more 
artificial snow we use, the more we 
heat the planet, and the more of the 
stuff we wind up needing. It’s all 
downhill from here.  Q

OR Emma, this time of the year has 
special significance, and not just 
because of all the gifts and food. 
It’s also the only time of year when the 
date in her mental calendar lines up 
perfectly with her body. 
Emma is a calendar synaesthete,  
one of a handful of people who see 
time: not as a vague conceptual 
timeline, but as a vivid calendar that 
feels so real they could almost touch 
it. This is a little-known variation of 
synaesthesia, in which the brain links 
one kind of sensation to another. Some 
people associate shapes with certain 
sounds, or colours with numbers (see
“Crossed wires”, opposite). Emma sees
time as a hula hoop, which anchors 31
December to her chest and projects the
rest of the year in a circle that extends
about a metre in front of her. 
Heidi, another calendar synaesthete,
sees the year as a backwards C hovering
before her, with January at one end of
the horseshoe and December at the 
other. When she thinks of a date she 
feels herself travel along the calendar to
the right spot. She has a separate, hoop-
shaped calendar for days of the week.
Both have been part of her life for as 
long as she can remember. 
The fact that certain people can 
vividly conjure number lines and 
calendars was first noted by Victorian
polymath Francis Galton in 1880, but
we have only recently begun to figure
out how – and why. It’s not just a matter
of idle curiosity. Understanding how 
calendar synaesthesia works may help
unravel the way we all keep track of our
memories as we move through space
and time. 
That’s because calendar synaesthetes 
experience a supercharged version of 
the way everyone else experiences 
time. Studies of different cultures 
around the world have shown that our 
perceptions vary slightly – most people 
in the West perceive time as a straight 
line running through their bodies, with 
the future ahead of them, while in parts 
of Papua New Guinea time flows uphill 
and for some Chinese people it flows 
downwards. But we all compute the 
abstract concept of time in the same 
way: in our brains, “time is always 
mapped onto space,” says V. S. 
Ramachandran, a neuroscientist at
the University of California, San Diego.
The mapping job falls largely to
the hippocampus, a pair of curved
structures towards the centre of the
brain that contain specialised neurons.
Some, called grid cells, plot locations,
while others, known as place cells,
become active when we arrive on the
scene. The basic circuitry seems to have
evolved about 300 million years ago
in a fish-like common ancestor, and
similar systems are found in most
other animals, from lizards to birds.
At some point in human evolution,
though, the hippocampus gained a
second role: storing autobiographical
memories, each with a time stamp
recorded by specialised time cells.
“As you live your life, place cells keep 
track of your location in the world, and 
time cells keep track of stimuli receding 
into the past,” says neuroscientist Marc 
Howard at Boston University. “When 
you vividly remember a specific event 
from your life – say lunch last Tuesday – 
the hippocampus recovers the activity 
of time cells and place cells that were 
active during that event.” 
Whether any other animals have this 
kind of autobiographical memory is 
hotly debated, but we know for sure 
that no other species makes calendars. 
Around 10,000 years ago, we began to 
notice the natural cycles of the sun 
and moon and record them for future 
reference, first in stone circles, and 
today on paper and computer screens. 
But calendar synaesthetes don’t 
need to. They can call up their mental

People who see vivid mental calendars 
could help us understand memory,

versions at will, something most are 
surprised to learn is unusual. Heidi first
realised in a psychology class in high 
school. “My teacher was talking about 
synaesthesia and how some people see
calendars. I said, ‘doesn’t everybody see
a calendar? How can you not?’ ”. 
Ramachandran wanted to know how
they do it, and if they were really seeing
calendars or summoning something 
from memory. So he asked a 20-year-
old synaesthete called ML to recite 
alternate months between January  
and December, first forwards and then
backwards. For most people, it takes 
three times as long to go backwards, 
because we have to construct the 
calendar from memory as we go. But 
ML was equally fast in both directions.
She also unconsciously moved her eyes
and finger as she went, suggesting her 
calendar was always in front of her.
To find out more, Ramachandran
also used visual illusions, including the
“motion after-effect”. If you stare for
30 seconds at a contracting spiral and
then look at another picture, it will
appear to expand, because the brain’s
prediction outpaces our perception.
But the illusion doesn’t happen if you
look at a blank wall or just imagine a 
scene. “The brain needs something to 
attribute it to,” says Ramachandran.
When ML looked at her calendar after 
the spiral, it expanded in the same way 
as a real image. When asked to imagine 
an object in her mind’s eye, it stayed still. 
That means that, as far as her brain is 
concerned, the calendar isn’t a figment 
of her imagination, it is actually there. 
What is going on? Ramachandran 
points to an area of the brain that we
rely on to make sense of symbols
and numbers and order events into 
sequences. The angular gyrus is found 
above and behind the ears on each side 
of the brain at the junction of several 
sensory areas, including the visual 
cortex. It also connects directly to the 
hippocampus. We all probably use this 
bit of circuitry to imagine the layout of 
time, but Ramachandran believes this 
is where calendar synaesthetes have 
the extra connections that make their 
visions so very real.
There are many open questions, not 
least whether this vivid calendar helps 
memory. There’s reason to think so. “If 
you ask them about a specific memory, 
then they’ll conjure up the calendar 
and put the memory in the appropriate 
slot,” says Ramachandran. 
That might be a trick worth learning. 
Daniel Bor at the University of Sussex, 
UK, has found that people can teach 
themselves to experience synaesthesia 
by repeatedly associating colours with 
certain letters. It might be possible to 
do something similar with calendars. 
But they may not be a universal 
boon. One synaesthete Ramachandran 
met finds her calendar confusing, and 
another says hers is missing August, 
which can be frustrating – not least for 
making plans for a summer break. 
For Heidi, it’s a mixed bag. “It helps 
me sometimes because I can picture 
things better, but I do get mixed up.” 
Her horseshoe-shaped calendar has a 
big gap after December, which means 
January always comes sooner than she 
expects it to. “It feels really abrupt, like 
a whole month was in between them 
and it just went all of a sudden,” she 
says. With the return to the office after 
Christmas looming, that’s probably 
something we can all relate to.  ■
Caroline Williams has time on her hands
Around 1 in every 40 people has 
some form of synaesthesia, in 
which sensations of one kind 
evoke another – so they might 
taste colours or hear flavours, 
for instance. Up to 15 per cent of 
synaesthetes experience vivid 
perceptions that seem to be 
“out there” in the world, rather 
than in their mind’s eye. 
Synaesthesia runs in families 
and is thought to be caused by 
extra wiring between adjacent 
sensory areas of the brain. 
People with one type are likely 
to have another unrelated kind 
as well. It is still unknown which 
gene or genes are involved.

Chasles was a pre-eminent scholar.
He had hammered out new geometry,
won international awards and was a
beloved“geometer of genius”.
His reputation stretched far beyond
France.Whenhetalked,peoplelistened.
But that morning, he stood on the
edge of a maelstrom. The letters, one of
them dated 1652 and apparently sent by
Pascal to Anglo-Irish chemistry pioneer
Robert Boyle, included an early
description of the law of gravitation.
The notes also contained calculations
of the masses of the major planets,
based on gravity and relative to the sun.
The controversial part? The date on the
letters was decades before Newton first
described the same law in his Principia.
It seemed Pascal deserved credit for one
of the biggest advances in the history
of physics. Newton was derivative.
“Newton dépossédé!”(Newton
dispossessed!) read the headline
of a Belgian newspaper soon after.
The affair agitated Europe’s scientific
community and beyond. Over the
next two years, it would swell to
envelop not only Newton and Pascal,
but also Galileo Galilei and René
Descartes, Caligula, Judas Iscariot, Joan
of Arc and even Jesus Christ himself.
Chasles’s supporters, typically lesser
members of the academy, praised the
sheer detail in the letters. Historians
noted that the paper was aged and the
ink chemistry consistent with the
epoch. The academy published the text
of the letters in its weekly proceedings.
Most established scientists were
sceptical. Objections poured in. Pascal’s
estimates of planet masses were too
precise; the handwriting wasn’t a close
match to other existing documents
penned by him; there were logical
inconsistencies. But Chasles not only
held firm, he doubled down. When a
critic pointed out that Pascal couldn’t
have worked without calculus, which
Newton had developed, Chasles
presented a new newly found letter in
which Pascal reported receiving a
manuscript from Newton describing
the“calculus of the infinite”. That was
problematic: judging by the date of
that letter, Newton would have been
just 11 years old.
By October, Chasles had obtained
and presented many letters between
Newton and Pascal that hinted at a
darker story: that a young Newton had
appropriated the work of Pascal and
other scientists to claim undue credit –
a claim that riled British historians.
An article in The Times said the charge
against Newton“touches our national
pride”and that the allegations should
be“repelled by his countrymen”.
The scandal grew. Chasles refused to
reveal his source, but produced letters
from other scientists“proving”that
Pascal, inspired by the work of Galileo
and Johannes Kepler, devised the law
of gravitation. Some letters came from
Galileo himself, who apparently had
a robust – and previously unknown –
correspondence with the young Pascal.
Get Galileo!
Italian historians jumped into the
fray, noting a complete lack of other 
evidence that Galileo even knew 
French. In fact, all the letters Chasles 
presented were in French – a fact that 
didn’t dissuade him or his supporters.
“One of the remarkable points of this 
affair is the unanimous sentiment that 
united the scholars of all these diverse 
countries in one spirit of indignation,” 
reported attorney Henri Bordier and 
librarian Emile Mabille, who 
investigated the affair in 1869.
The cycle continued for two years, 
with Chasles answering questions by 
presenting more letters, which raised 
more questions. Many prominent 
historians believed the letters to be 
authentic, or at least that they were 
copies of authentic documents. It was 
in 1869, under pressure from his critics, 
that Chasles revealed to the academy 
that he had obtained the manuscripts

from a mysterious archivist called 
Denis Vrain-Lucas, and enlisted  
the police to visit the man’s home. 
Inside, they found Vrain-Lucas, but  
no manuscripts. Instead, there was an 
array of ink bottles and blank pages 
ripped from old books. It was clear that
Vrain-Lucas was writing the documents
himself. He was duly arrested.
Vrain-Lucas, an insatiable reader 
from Châteaudun, started out as a law 
clerk in nearby Chartres and moved to 
Paris in 1852. At first, he pursued work 
in bookstores and libraries, but was 
stymied by his lack of formal education.
Finally, he was hired by a firm that 
forged family pedigrees for people who
wanted to “uncover” their genealogical
links to famous French people. It was 
perfect training: by 1854, he was
working on forgeries of his own.
He“drew boldness from his very 
ignorance”, wrote Bordier and Mabille,
and he “hoped, against all expectations,
that a catastrophe did not necessarily 
lie at the end of his undertaking”. 
For the better part of two decades, 
with the industry of a monk, the 
counterfeiter reportedly created and 
sold more than 27,000 forgeries,
including letters and autographs.
He would pilfer blank pages from old 
books in Parisian libraries, sometimes 
wetting them to age them. 
It was in 1861 that Vrain-Lucas first 
visited the home of Chasles and sold 
him three letters: one each from the 
playwrights Molière and Jean Racine, 
and one from the scholar François 
Rabelais. Vrain-Lucas said he had been 
entrusted to sell documents belonging 
to a collector who had died in a
shipwreck, but whose collection
had survived. Chasles bought every 
manuscript Vrain-Lucas brought him. 
Chasles’s collection stretched far 
beyond science, and Vrain-Lucas’s 
fabrications grew increasingly reckless. 
He rewrote history through a huge cast 
of characters. Judas Iscariot wrote to
Mary Magdalene, who wrote to
Lazarus – risen from the dead – about
her hopes of seeing Jesus, and how
she enjoyed her travels in France. In 
another note, she mentions a letter 
from Jesus. “Lucas’ fecundity shames 
other forgers,” notes historian Joseph 
Rosenblum in Prince of Forgers. 
But this fecundity caught up with 
him, with his arrest. Chasles testified
that over the course of eight years, he
had spent more than 140,000 francs –
a fortune – on Vrain-Lucas’s products. 
No one knows why Chasles was so well 
deceived, but the judge was clear where 
the blame lay: “You have abused in the 
most brazen manner the passion of an 
old man, of a scholar, his passion as a
collector and his love for his country,
in order to deceive him shamefully.”
Vrain-Lucas was fined 500 francs and 
sentenced to two years in jail. While 
inside, he wrote to Chasles, who visited 
him regularly and prayed for him. 
It seems Chasles had fallen under 
Vrain-Lucas’s spell. Perhaps that’s why 
the controversy left his reputation only 
bruised and his character untarnished. 
When Chasles died in 1880, an obituary 
in Nature affirmed his integrity and 
noted “how honourably he extricated 
himself from the matter, and did all in 
his power to repair the mischief done”. 
The shock waves that Vrain-Lucas 
sent through science subsided, but his 
con-artistry did not. He would bounce 
back into jail twice more, before being 
banished to his home town, where he 
ended his days as a second-hand book 
seller. Quite a comedown for the man 
who hijacked history.  Q

consulting the phone itself.

will be called Eldrano, and not
as we first proposed Eldranol,
which turns out to be already
trademarked for a bovine

Over time the Elf Queen’s
underjaw has thickened, while
her chin has remained small and
pointed, her nose turned up, so
that you can see, embedded in fat,
the adolescent she was fifteen
hundred years ago. In her garden
she keeps papery silver poppies
and an iris which smells of
chocolate; but since the Fall of
Llyngitgothgethreal, the rest of
her life has been half-warm meals
in cold rooms. Though he still
carries the single strand of her
hair she gave him in the grim
days before the battle of Clotsore
Moor, the dwarf knows that their
relationship is over. So when she
says, in a final rather desperate
move to regain the initiative, that
she has decided to go away for a
week, he only shrugs.
“I need to get some space,”she
tells him.“Great,”he says vaguely.
“Get right away,”she insists.
“Everyone needs space,”he says.
She leaves the room but calls
back,“I can’t think what’s wrong
with you.”
The dwarf can’t bring himself to
say. As they fail to get older, elves
cling on to peak moments and try
to repeat them, squeezing a little
less out each time until they are
only going through the motions.
To an outsider this makes their
whole society seem grotesque,
caricatured, desperate. He doesn’t
want to be a party to it any more. 
He wants to be back underground, 
where the real things are 
happening.

Last Transmission 
from the Deep Halls
... saying, once those outsiders get 
in your tortured halls... I’m saying 
we didn’t have command of the 
vast fictions of the day... The city 
wasn’t, in the end, where those of 
us who lived there thought it was. 
We had already lost it in all senses 
of that word... All we knew of this 
place was the news... the halls are 
aware that – in the end – they can 
never know what, exactly, the plot 
was. It’s only silence after that. 
Back at the beginning there’s  
the tapping sound, like metal on 
stone... then the call signs, several 
of them, very amplified and 
confused... cries in the halls...  
a cruel few words and then,  
“We no longer know which way  
to face.” The halls are still aware... 
What if the city didn’t “fall”?  
What if nothing “fell”? Nothing 
was lost but existed just alongside 
everything else, fifty years later  
in the rubble by a farm at the flat 
end of nowhere... who could write 
this... everyone has a different 
story to sell... call signatures in 
rooks, fresh plough, old silence: 
“We don’t know what to do. 
Everything is the alongside of 
something else...” Minor players 
gesture helplessly... signals hard 
to make out in the chaos as the big
institutions go down... everyone 
desperate now.
The palace turned out to be a 
stuffy, disappointing warren that 
just reeked of dogs. The Queen 
showed us around lots of small 
low-ceilinged rooms with fitted 
carpets, not what we were looking 
for at all. No real Elf Land values or 
internal architecture left, except 
for that rather gorgeous river 
frontage. She kept saying that she 
and her husband had been going 
to make this or that improvement, 
but everything was interrupted 
when “They came back”. At one 
point she said, “we were going to 
sell up, go to the Deep West, but 
they came back. They came back, 
you see, and what can you do?” 
She never said who or what they 
were. There was an old labrador 
sleeping outside the back door. 
They also had a really quite smelly 
chihuahua, always gazing up at 
you, and when you petted it,  
“Oh she’ll go to anyone, that one. 
When you’re shopping she’ll go 
straight in your bag.” Meanwhile, 
honestly, Eldrano just vegetated 
there in the front room, watching 
cable TV on satellite and in the 
end we decided no matter how 
close it was to the Evening 
Harbours it just wasn’t for us. ■

Island of the Blue Foxes: Disaster and
triumph on the world’s greatest
scientific expedition by Stephen R.
Bown, Da Capo Press
SOME might call it
ambitious, others
madness. The
Great Northern
Expedition,
dreamed up by
Peter the Great
in 1724 and
completed five Russian rulers
later in 1743, was the biggest,
longest scientific expedition in
history – undeniably ambitious,
then. Thousands of people
trekked 8000 kilometres from
St Petersburg on Russia’s western
coast to Okhotsk on the Pacific,
a terrible journey through the
roadless and lawless wilds of
Siberia. Those who then went on
to sail in search of the Great Land
(Alaska), endured scurvy and
shipwreck. Only the overly
optimistic could have believed
it anything but madness.
In Island of the Blue Foxes,
Stephen Bown has drawn on
journals, logs, letters and official
reports to piece together a story
never fully told before. And what
a story: adventure and discovery,
misery and death, and a cast of
characters by turns admirable and
appalling, brilliant and hopeless,
annoying and plain nasty. Two of
them – Vitus Bering, the Danish
leader of the expedition, and
German naturalist Georg Steller –
have long been heroes of mine.
Thanks to Bown’s revelations and
brilliant storytelling, I now know
just how astonishing their
exploits were.
In 1725, Bering led a preliminary
expedition to Russia’s far east,
then built a ship and sailed north
along the coast of Kamchatka in
search of a passage to the Arctic
Ocean. He found what is now the
Bering Strait, but thanks to thick
fog failed to spot Alaska. In 1733,
he set out again, charged with
stamping Russia’s authority on
Siberia, laying claim to Alaska and
opening up new trade routes, as
well as exploration and discovery.
Bering retraced his route, this
time with an army of scientists,
soldiers, servants, wives, children
and labourers – and everything
they needed, from tools, ropes
and sails to candelabra, silk
gowns, powdered wigs and his
wife Anna’s clavichord.
After four years of hard travel,
they reached Okhotsk. There, they
built a dockyard and two ships,
the St Peter and St Paul, to explore
the far north Pacific. What
happened next is the stuff of
nightmares. The two ships lost
contact. Fog, storms and blizzards
meant they were sailing almost
blind in uncharted waters dotted
with islands and reefs. In July 1741,
both ships reached Alaska but
neither stayed long, fearful of
being trapped over the winter.  
By October, the St Paul was back  
in Siberia, with 21 men lost or  
dead from scurvy. 
Peter the Great planned a fabulously extravagant expedition to Russia’s
far east and Alaska. Stephanie Pain finds out what really happened
Okhotsk in Russia’s far east:
the jumping-off point for Alaska

ALL the most entertaining pencil-
and-paper puzzles come from
Japan. Sudoku is the best known,
but there are hundreds more.
I’ve selected two types of puzzle
from my recent book that I think
New Scientist readers will
particularly enjoy. In each, the
grids can be filled in through
logical deduction alone.
KenKen
In 2004, maths teacher Tetsuya
Miyamoto wanted to create a
puzzle for his classes of 8-year-
olds using the basic arithmetical
operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division.
So he devised KenKen, which
became a hit in Japan and now
features in some UK newspapers.
However, in the newspaper
version, the mathematical
symbols for the arithmetical
operations required are always
written in the grid. Too easy!
In the two examples here (top
left and right), which Miyamoto
designed by hand, the symbols
are omitted, making for a much
more interesting challenge. The
number of ninja heads indicates
the level of difficulty.
The rules: fill the grid with
the numbers between 1 and the
total number of rows (1, 2, 3, 4 in
a 4×4 grid, forexample),soeach
number appears only once in
every row or column. The grid
is divided into“cages”, each
containing a target number in
its top left corner.
Using only one arithmetical
operation in each cage, either
+, –, ×, or ÷, you must produce
the target number using all
the numbers in that cage. So,
if there are two cells in a cage,

the numbers in those cells must

Straight Cross 
What would you get if you 
combined a crossword with a 
sudoku? Puzzle creator Naoki 
Inaba set himself this challenge 
and came up with Straight Cross. 
I find it more rewarding than 
sudoku, since you must take into
account the numerical value of 
the number, which adds an 
unusual twist. Try these two 
examples (bottom left and right).
The rules: fill the cells with 
numbers from 1 to 9 (but not 
necessarily all of them) so each 
horizontal and vertical strip
contains consecutive numbers.
A strip is made up of adjacent 
white cells between the edges
of the grid and/or black squares.
Although the numbers must  
be consecutive, the sequence 
needn’t start with 1 and the
numbers can be in any order.
So, if the digits are 2, 3 and 4,  
for example, they could be in  
the order 2-3-4, 2-4-3, 3-2-4, 3-4-2, 
4-2-3 or 4-3-2.  ■
The puzzles are from Puzzle Ninja: Pit 
your wits against the Japanese puzzle 
masters by Alex Bellos  (Guardian 
Faber). For solutions, see page 83
The St Peter was even less 
fortunate. In November, with  
the crew sick, dying or dead from 
scurvy, the ship was wrecked on  
a desolate island. The survivors 
lived in holes dug in the beach, 
with little protection from the 
weather and hardly any food. 
They were attacked by packs of a 
dark-furred subspecies of Arctic 
fox. The foxes “crowded into our 
dwellings and stole everything 
they could carry”, Steller reported. 
They bit the sick and dying and
“ate the hands and feet of the
corpses before we had time to 
bury them”, wrote Lieutenant 
Sven Waxell.
Then Bering died. The 
survivors’ fate now lay in the 
hands of Waxell, the new leader, 
and Steller, who became revered 
for his botanical knowledge and 
skill in treating scurvy. Stuck on 
the island, he was also able to do 
what he came to do: observe and 
describe nature.
In the event, Steller was the  
only naturalist to see some of the 
species he described. His sea cow 
was a gigantic, 4-tonne manatee 
with blubber “as agreeably yellow 
as the best Holland butter” and 
beef-like meat that stayed good 
for weeks. The goose-sized 
spectacled cormorant was easy to 
catch, and one bird was “sufficient 
for three starving men”.  
The island’s birds and marine 
mammals were a vital source of 
food for shipwrecked men, but 
Steller worried the expedition 
would open up new routes for 
hunters who would destroy what 
he had discovered. He was right.
Ten months after the wreck, 
Bering’s men sailed back to 
Kamchatka in a small ship built 
from the remains of the St Peter. 
Ambitious or mad? You decide.  ■

Universe: Exploring the astronomical 
world, Intro by Paul Murdin, Phaidon
LATE one summer 
night in 1845, the 
3rd Earl of Rosse 
climbed up to an 
18-metre-high 
platform to focus  
a telescope on a nebula known as 
M51. At the time, the telescope 
was the world’s biggest, and 
operating it took considerable 
stamina. But what Rosse saw was 
worth his effort. The light resolved 
into a whirlpool – the first spiral 
galaxy ever observed.
Rosse’s resulting drawing is 
humble and astonishing. The ink 
smudges lack the grandeur of the
Hubble Space Telescope’s images
of M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy),
buttheywere stunningly accurate.
It exemplifies astronomy’s
close link to technology: more
powerful instruments allow
more penetrating insights.
The opportunity for such side-
by-side comparison is just one
of the pleasures of Universe,  
a spectacular book with 300 
images relating to astronomy. 
These range from a Lascaux cave 
painting made in 15,000 BC, where
dots may depict the Pleiades,  
to a photo of Jupiter’s south pole
released by NASA this year. Visual
art is also included, from Vincent
van Gogh’s Starry Night to Sarah 
Sze’s 21st-century Planetarium. 
These deliberately disparate 
images are paired to provoke the 
viewer. While some pairings are 
fairly straightforward, others are 
more playful. For example, the 
Horsehead nebula is juxtaposed 
with the Egyptian Temple of 
Hathor, where animal-headed 
deities are portrayed against a 
background of stars. 
But these pairings are mere 
enticements to find other 
connections: it’s choose your own 
adventure, with the whole cosmos 
to explore. One such tour offers 
myriad views of how we make 
sense of the universe, revealing 
the brilliance and the blind spots
of conjecture. The brilliance is 
strikingly illustrated in a 1659 
diagram by the Dutch polymath 
Christiaan Huygens, drawn for a 
book deducing that Saturn must
be encircled with rings. At the
time, Galileo contended that the 
rings were attached to the planet.
Conjectural blind spots, 
however, show up in a drawing 
illustrating scholar Martianus 
Capella’s geo-heliocentric model 
of the universe. In the 5th century,
Capella cleverly marshalled 
contemporary observations in 
support of the prevailing world 
view. His drawing is a powerful 
evocation of confirmation bias.
Both graphics hold more than 
historical interest. Together they 
provide important context for 
understanding another
remarkable image in Universe:
a still from the Millennium 
Simulation of 2005, in which the 
Virgo Consortium extrapolated 
the distribution of dark matter 
across the cosmos. It’s cutting-
edge science, deserving both 
admiration and scepticism.
Another thematic course begins
with a simple, yet iconic diagram
of the heliocentric universe from
Nicolaus Copernicus’s 1543 book, 
De Revolutionibus, and reveals our
ongoing struggle to absorb the 
implications of the Copernican 
revolution. One big hurdle has 
been to grasp our unexceptional 
place in the vastness of space. 
Science and art have provided an 
impressive range of visual aids. 
For instance, Universe includes an
1851 educational chart in which 
the relative distance of the planets 
from the sun was shown in terms 
of the time a cannonball would 
take to hit them. And in 2011, 
artist Mishka Henner brilliantly 
presented the solar system in a 
6000-page book, where each leaf 
represents a million kilometres. 
Most pages are blank.
And yet the most powerful way 
to become Copernican has been to 
look ever further into the cosmos 
and discover ever more stars and 
planets like ours. Images of spiral 
galaxies hold a special place in 
this gaze, because they have the 
same structure as the Milky Way. 
From Rosse’s sketch to the Hubble 
images, peering at the Whirlpool 
we see ourselves from afar – and 
recognise that beings from M51 
may be taking the same picture.  Q

Natural Histories: Traces of the
Political, Mumok, Vienna, Austria,
until 14 January 2018
VISITORS to Vienna’s spectacular
Natural History Museum may
discover some taxidermied
exhibits smothered in black
gloop. This is artist Mark Dion’s
The Tar Museum, and it is part of
Natural Histories: Traces of the
Political, an art exhibition about
nature and politics, most of
which is in the nearby museum
of contemporary art, Mumok.
Those venturing across the
Maria-Theresien-Platz will not
be sorry. Or not at first. Early on,
there is charming, sometimes
beautiful documentation of work
in the 1970s by the Romanian
Sigma group. Inspired by research
in bionics and cybernetics,
mathematician Lucian Codreanu
and his fellows applied scientific
method to their observations of
the rivers and woods of the
Timisoara hunting forest.
Doru Tulcan’s abstract sculpture
Structuring the Cube makes
something surprisingly organic,
suggestive of the workings of
a crayfish’s eye, from a tiny
vocabulary of rods and triangles.
Meanwhile, Stefan Bertalan’s
Structure of the Elderflower earns
its place by virtue of its exquisite
draughtsmanship. This being
the 1970s, the Sigma group also
enjoyed a lot of more-or-less
undressed mucking about, and
became a focus of dissent against
Nicolae Ceausescu’s dictatorship.
The other artists, groups and
movements in this show rarely
achieved as direct an engagement
with the natural world.
Many pieces here index human
activity through changes in the
environment. The models and
photographs of Anca Benera and
Arnold Estefan’s Debrisphere
record how landscapes have been
altered for military purposes.
More often, though, the art
focuses on how nature encroaches
on human settlement. In Arena,
Anri Sala records the decayed
state of Tirana zoo, with feral
dogs occupying a space meant
for people, while the zoo’s“wild”
animals languish in cages.
Nature’s eradication of human
traces can’t come quickly enough
in some cases. In 2003, Polish
sculptor Miroslaw Balka visited
Auschwitzandfilmeddeergrazing
by the barbed wire fence of the
concentration camp. A wall board
observesthat,in1942(whenBambi
was released),“while cinemagoers
were shedding tears about the
emotional story of a little deer,
the‘final solution’and the murder
of millions of people was already
beingplanned”.Thisissilly:would
the world be any better if Bambi’s
bereavement left us unmoved?
It gets worse. Exquisite
allegorical frescoes by 18th-
century artist Johann Wenzel
Bergl are“recognizable as
strategies of absolutist picture
propaganda”. And back with Dion:
one installation capturing“the
lifestyle and self-image of the
prototypical ethnographer of
colonial times”, isn’t even that,
according to the curators, but
alludes“to our own imagination
of that ethnographer”.
I left feeling rather as Lewis
Carroll’s Alice might have felt if,
instead of freely stepping through
the mirror, she had been shoved
through it from behind by a gang
of goonish anthropologists.
Natural Histories is a portal
into a world where history,
politics, horror, guilt and the
natural world are sewn together.
It is well worth seeing, but I wish 
the curators had shut up.  ■
Just experience it
Curators can get in the way of a good show, finds Simon Ings

Well done – I hope you didn’t find

required must be multiplication. 
And remember, a number can be

Animalrightsneednot
besubjecttocaveat
From Rod Munday,
Llanishen, Cardiff, UK
The reason MPs voted not to
enshrine the Lisbon treaty
into UK law was that the treaty
is flawed and ineffective in
preventing cruelty to animals
(2 December, p 25).
After the fine words about
animals being sentient beings,
the treaty promises to respect
“the legislative or administrative
provisions of the member states,
relating in particular to religious
rites, cultural traditions and
regional heritage”.
This caveat means that if
memberstateshaveatraditional
activity involving cruelty to
animals they can continue doing
it.Thisincludestorturingbullsto
death in the bullring for public
entertainment, confining veal
calves in narrow crates so that
they can hardly move, force-
feeding geese through metal
tubes pushed down their throats
to produce foie gras, treating
donkeysasiftheywereunfeeling
machines, negligent cruelty to
live animals being shipped for
slaughter and so forth.
These activities would already
be illegal in this country under
current UK law.

LETTERS
From David Byrne,
Swinton, Dunstable, UK
You assert that more than half the
children in the UK and the US are being
brought up outside a nuclear family
(2 December, p 5). This is wrong, at
least for the UK. The latest figures
from the Office for National Statistics
show that of the nearly 8 million
EDITOR’S PICK
households containing dependent 
children, 78 per cent contain two 
parents of opposite genders, either 
married or cohabiting. 
So the traditional nuclear family  
is still the dominant one. However, 
many children experience more  
than one kind of family during their 
childhood. Even I, now 70 years old, 
lived in an extended family with my 
single mother, and then in a traditional 
household when she remarried. 
Cross-sectional studies are 
valueless in exploring the effect of 
family type on children’s happiness. 
Longitudinal studies would allow us  
to explore the trajectories of children 
through multiple household types. 
My experience is that what matters 
is that parents, alone or together, gay 
or straight, love their children and let 
their children know it. 
Love is the key ingredient for happy families

are not matched to the recipient.
Previously, New Scientist 
reported evidence that 
Parkinson’s progression is driven 
by an autoimmune response 
attacking dopamine-producing 
cells (24 June, p 11). 
In my experience, 
immunosuppression therapy has
been of great benefit in reducing 
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease,
though I take this medication for
sarcoidosis.
A chiller for wine keeps 
fruit just fine
From Gwydion Williams,
Coventry, West Midlands, UK
Sam Wong raises the problem of  
a fridge being too cold for storing
tomatoes, yet the kitchen being 
too warm (9 December, p 25). 
I solved this by buying a wine 
cooler. I seldom drink wine, but it
stores my tomatoes and bananas
very nicely. They used to rot or get
overripe, and at 12°C they seem 
fine. Is there a market for a fruit 
and vegetable cool box?
When Earth sneezes, the
cosmos catches a cold
From Richard Swifte,
Darmstadt, Germany
I am alarmed by Claudius Gros’s 
suggestion that we should 
deliberately seed life throughout
the cosmos (18 November, p 10). 
Space agencies quite rightly  
try to sterilise spacecraft sent  
to planets or moons that might 
harbour life, however remote  
the possibility, in order to avoid 
contamination. Gros’s plan is  
in direct contradiction to this. 
We still need much more 
investigation to verify whether 
any of the bodies in our solar 
system contain life or not, so it is 
unrealistic for us to think we can 
show that any planet in another
star system is truly sterile. 
Without such proof, it should  
be considered unethical to risk
wiping out alien life forms with
Earth-despatched panspermia. I
hope this idea will fail to become
reality.
Bitcoin is too valuable to
spend on stuff
From Trevor Campbell,
Berrima, NSW, Australia
Bitcoin may be a success at many
things, but surely it must be a 
failure as a currency (2 December,
p 36). If there can only ever be 
21 million bitcoins, then the supply
is obviously highly restricted,  
and the currency will be in a 
permanent state of deflation. 
Your bitcoins will almost 
certainly have more buying  
power tomorrow than they do 
today. If that is so they are a great
investment, but why would you 
ever use them to buy stuff?
Today, the economy relies on 
more currency continuously 
entering the system to support  
an increasing amount of trade 
and wealth and relies on inflation, 
hopefully at a controllable low 
level, to discourage hoarding  
and promote investment and 
spending.
Don’t paint a smiley face 
on the grim reaper
From Jessica Roberts,
Brighouse, West Yorkshire, UK
Your interview with mortician 
Caitlin Doughty was unnerving, 
but also gave much food for 
thought (11 November, p 40).  
If we Westerners were to change 
our attitudes towards death and 
become a lot more positive in
dealing with it, I feel it would take

TOM GAULD
We need to fear death, and more
so in this century where there is  
a very big movement in science 
towards a future that is free of 
disease and the effects of old age,
and therefore of most death. 
What does Doughty think of 
cryonics, which promises to 
preserve your dead body until  
you can be revived by future 
technology? She may well prefer 
having her dead body consumed 
by ravenous vultures, but to  
me nothing deserves more 
celebration than the prolonging 
of life and teaching our children 
that one day everyone may live a 
very long, very happy life. Because
isn’t that what matters in the end?
Finding the universe’s 
missing matter
From Chris Wilkins,
Tewin, Hertfordshire, UK
Gilead Amit writes that if dark 
matter is continuously decaying 
into dark energy, it would explain
the otherwise unexplained rate
of the universe’s expansion
(9 December, p 28).
We now know that gravity and 
light travel at the same speed. Also
that at a critical mass, light is 
unable to escape and a black hole is
formed. Could there be another, 
greater critical mass where  
gravity also could not escape? 
If so, the effective mass of the 
universe would reduce over time,
presumably giving a similar 
effect. This would also account  
for the structure of halo galaxies.
Perhaps indoor solar is 
not such a bright idea 
From Ben Haller,
Ithaca, New York, US
You say a 5-centimetre-square 
solar panel being developed “ 
can’t quite extract enough energy
from indoor light to charge a
phone in a reasonable time
frame”(18 November, p 16). 
Let’s suppose the room in 
question is lit by a 100 watt 
incandescent bulb with an 
efficiency of about 2.2 per cent, 
generating about 2.2 watts in  
the form of light. That bulb 
illuminates every surface of a 
small room 3 metres cubed, for a 
surface area of 54 square metres 
or 540,000 square centimetres.
A solar panel occupying 25 
square centimetres of this room 
will claim about 0.0001 watts. 
Evenifthesolarpanelis100per 
cent efficient, it seems to me
that“can’t quite extract
enough energy from indoor
light to charge a phone in a 
reasonable time frame” must 
qualify as the understatement  
of the year.
With engine emissions, 
size doesn’t matter
From Ernest Ager,
Exmouth, Devon, UK
Governments of all persuasions 
have always taxed road vehicles 
unfairly,withvaryingamountsof
tax on both fuel and the annual
vehicle tax (2 December, p 24).  
In more recent years, concern 
about climate change has led to 
still more muddled thinking. 
For example, larger engine 
vehicles naturally pay more in 
fuel tax as they use more fuel. 
However, if you run a vehicle  
with a larger engine, but with a 
low mileage per year, the car tax 
remains the same. Clearly, if you 
burn the same amount of fuel in a
year as a car with a smaller engine,
then the total emissions are the 
same. So why is the vehicle tax 
double or more?
The government should 
practise what it preaches
From Chas Bazeley, 
Colchester, Essex, UK
Youwriteaboutthesteeppricewe
face for failing to tackle climate
change (4 November, p 24). One 
reason for our apathy is that, in 
the UK at least, the government 
uses climate change as an excuse 
to tax the public and restrict their 
freedoms while using “carbon 
neutral” wood-burning at Drax 
power station to fudge its own 
figures on renewables. People are 
unlikely to become enthusiastic 
about climate-change mitigation 
unless those in power are seen to 
be taking it seriously. 
Flat-Earthers driven 
around the bend
From Simon Pryce,
Radlett, Hertfordshire, UK
Elsa Beckett asks whether a group 
of flat-Earthers has ever mounted
an expedition to find the edge
of the planet (9 December, p 52). 
Perhaps they have sent one and 
are still looking for it.
For the record

Letitglow,letitglow,
letitsnow…
Christmas comes but once a year – and for some of us, so does
a good snowfall. Here’s how to make sure you don’t miss it
For more Makes visit newscientist.com/make
MAKE
Do try this at home
“I love building snowmen,  
but the neighbourhood kids 
snatch up every flake for their 
snowball arsenal,” writes Jack F. 
“My wife gives me an icy stare 
if I keep flicking to the weather 
channel, and I can’t stay glued 
to the window when we’re 
entertaining relatives. How can 
I make sure I don’t miss out?” 
I may be dreaming of a white 
Christmas, but I’m not changing 
out of my PJs unless the odds  
of a snowman are favourable. 
But what if I could deck my  
hall with a personalised snow 
predictor? It’s time to hack the 
Christmas tree… 
I grabbed a pack of clear 
baubles and sprinkled in some 
glitter and polystyrene beads. 
This does a good impression of 
snow, and I slapped on some 
adhesive snowflakes for good 
measure. LEDs slipped into the 
top of each bring real sparkle, 
and trailing wires can be 
cunningly disguised with tinsel. 
Now for the clever part – 
connecting the baubles to my 
Adafruit Feather, a circuit board 
that can talk to my home Wi-Fi. 
I programmed it to contact the 
Dark Sky weather service, which 
collates data from different 
sources to give a forecast for 
your GPS location – or the local 
tobogganing hill’s. To build 
excitement, the lights function 
like a progress bar – each extra 
tier illuminates as the chance of 
snow increases. 
When the snow starts 
falling, my baubles send flurries 
of light cascading down the 
tree, simulating a mini blizzard. 
The tree updates every minute, 
so you can tell whether it’s just 
a sprinkle or something more.  
In my flat, we’ve agreed we 
won’t brave the elements for 
anything less than 10 minutes 
of continuous snow. 
The snow tracker should be 
an easy project even after a 
couple of sherries, although my 
prototype had me dashing out 
in my snow boots to blue skies – 
it thought I was in Iceland. 
You can also connect the 
lights to Google’s open source 
Santa Tracker, which plots St 
Nick’s course on Christmas Eve. 
Get to sleep before the top 
bauble illuminates or he’ll skip 
your house. Now there’s no 
need to keep checking weather 
apps, Jack. But you might want 
a second set of lights for the 
tree – just in case it’s a mild year.

DO YOU hear the pitter-patter of tiny 
feet? Elf sightings are on the rise,  
and it’s a trend for life, not just 
for Christmas. A team of folklore 
researchers led by Simon Young 
at the University of Virginia has 
published a compendium of British 
encounters with fairy folk, charting  
a steady rise in sightings.  
An online survey of 1062 people 
found that 44 per cent reported 
seeing fairies, and the majority of 
these eagle-eyed respondents had 
seen them more than once. 
Sadly, not all of these pointy-eared
folk appear to be the jovial stripy-
socked toy-makers you might find in 
Santa’s workshop. Some of these 
creatures were mischievous, even 
malevolent by turns. One Devon 
resident reports being threatened by
“small men with lots of hair, in brown 
suits, almost dirty-looking”, while a
respondent in Cornwall said they
had an encounter with “a brown
leathery-skinned, very angry looking
old man”. Plus ça change!
PURVEYOR of proprietary colour
swatches Pantone has announced
its choice for colour of the year.
“We are living in a time that
requires inventiveness and
imagination,”the announcement
intones.“It is this kind of creative
inspiration that is indigenous
to PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra
Violet.”Yes, it’s a“dramatically
provocative and thoughtful”
purple,“complex and
contemplative”. This colour“takes
our awareness and potential to a
higher level”, and is“associated
with mindfulness practices,
which offer a higher ground to
those seeking refuge from today’s
over-stimulated world”.
It falls on Feedback to
remark that purple is also the 
colour associated with turgid, 
flowery prose.
AND now to Alabama, where last
week the Republican Roy Moore
narrowly lost out to Democrat Doug
Jones in a US Senate race. Voters in
Alabama were treated to a “special”
election, following the promotion of
button-eyed senator Jeff Sessions to
the role of US Attorney General.
That move left one less climate
change sceptic in the Senate. Who
might then be a suitable replacement?
Enter Roy Moore, the firebrand
evangelical Christian who is sceptical
about a lot more than just greenhouse
gases: abortion, gay rights, Islamic
worship, women’s suffrage, and the
abolition of slavery, among others.
He also seems to be nursing some
wounds that have not healed since
the Scopes trial of 1925.
Addressing the National Clergy
Council in 1997, Moore blamed the
teaching of evolution in public schools
for drive-by shootings. These young
people, said Moore, were “acting like
animals because we taught them they
come from animals”.
However, Moore has been accused
of having an interest in children that
is sometimes less than godly. He still
faces a string of allegations of sexual
misconduct, including claims he
molested a 14-year-old girl. Which of
these factors led voters to decide
Moore wasn’t fit to represent Alabama
we can’t say; but at least the result
means some sense has prevailed –
a special election indeed.
GIVEN the season, Feedback
has taken a leaf out of Father
Christmas’s book and drawn
up our list of who has been nice 
enough to warrant a gift this year. 
For those of you who, like us, 
have left their present shopping 
to the last minute, Feedback  
offers its own unique gift guide, 
collected from issues past. 
At the budget end of the scale, 
why not procure that classic
Christmas gift: a pair of socks.
No ordinary socks though,
but the silver-laced anti-static
footwear from Sock’M, claimed to
be designed for the“challenging
conditions of space”(1 July). Just
remember to complement them
with a fully functional space suit.
AND speaking of protective wear,
why not consider gemstone-studded
wonderpants (9 August)? The ZK 
Magnetotherapy Breathable U-Shape 
Underwear Antibacterial Healthcare 
Modal Boxer For Men features no less 
than 500 tourmaline stones, which 
promise to increase your nerve 
conduction velocity, which we think  
is a way of saying you’ll blush even 
faster when you unwrap them in 
front of your mum. 
FOR those with a keen interest  
in healing gems and even more 
money to spend, there’s the 
Healthy Urn, a product we find 
ineffable, if only because its full 
name is 25 words long (18 March). 
The giant vase/sauna/isolation 
chamber is the perfect place to 
hide from relatives during the 
holiday season, and thus well 
worth the £18,300 price tag. 
AND a final word on stocking stuffers: 
Bill Quinton suspects that not all 
Christmas presents are made by  
elves. The warning plastered to the 
20-centimetre-diameter football he 
purchased for his grandson tells him: 
“Not suitable for children under three 
years. Choking hazard”. 
Bill notes that the warning label 
also recommends he “retain this 
information”, which might help 
emergency room doctors diagnose
a case of football-stuck-in-throat.
He muses that “somewhere in the
football-manufacturing district of
China there must be a race of giants.”

ANSWERS
1. a. The fossils were found in Jebel 
Irhoud, Morocco. 
2. a. Leonardo was better known as 
Fibonacci, which is likely to have 
been a contraction of Filius Bonacci, 
or “son of a Bonaccio”.
3. b. Scientist and amateur beekeeper 
Federica Bertocchini removed wax 
moth larvae from her honeycombs 
and stored them in a plastic bag. 
She found that this parasite could 
munch its way through polythene and 
polypropylene, two of the most commonly 
used plastics.
 4. a. As of last month, China had 202 of 
the 500 fastest supercomputers on the 
planet, while the US had 143. The fastest 
supercomputer is currently  China’s 
Sunway TaihuLight.
5. c. The tuatara’s “third eye”, located on 
the top of its head, is sensitive to light 
but unable to form images.
6. b. Pele’s hair has nothing to do with 
the famous footballer, but rather takes 
its name from a Hawaiian goddess of 
fire and volcanoes.
7. a. Drone footage shot in north-east 
Canada showed, for the first time, 
narwhals using their tusks to hunt Arctic 
cod by striking and stunning them, 
making them easier to eat. 
8. b. The gravitational waves were 
from two neutron stars. Unlike 
black  holes, neutron stars produce 
detectable electromagnetic radiation, 
so astronomers were able to observe 
the collision in the electromagnetic 
spectrum as well. 
9. c. Neopalpa donaldtrumpi are 
found in southern California and Baja 
California, Mexico. The species was 
given its name by Canadian lepidopterist 
Vazrick Nazari.
10. b. Hawking’s 1966 thesis 
“Properties of expanding universes” 
was made openly accessible in October, 
with 60,000 people accessing it on the 
first day.
