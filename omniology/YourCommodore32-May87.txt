some programs are able t o  use
graphics with the speed o f  ﬁlm-
animation? While, if you try your hand
at high-resolution graphics, i t takes
ages for the screen to clear, let alone,
something exciting to happen.
This is because you are attempting
to do the job in Basic which is very
slow in execution.
Why? Because the Basic program is
interpreted, th a t i s, th e  Basic
interpreter, which resides in ROM and
is nothing more than a very large
machine code program. looks at each
Basic instruction separately_ Even a
simple Basic command like "POKE"
hides a routine in ROM which is as
long as your arm. And it has to do all
this every time it comes up against the
"POKE" command, as i f  i t never
heard of "POKE" before. No wonder
that Basic is slow!

6510
Want to overcome the limitations of Basic? Speed things
up on your C64/128? This ﬁrst article in a series is your
entry into the world of machine code programming
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
The 6510 chip in your Commodore
64 is the real computer. Everything
else, like the ROM and RAM chips and
the keyboard, are peripherals. The
6510 does all the donkey work, even if
a program in Basic is being run. Why
communicate through th e  Basic
i n te rp re te r  w h e n  y o u  c a n
communicate directly w i th  t h e
microprocessor, which executes your
instructions immediately?
But how d o  you talk t o  the
microprocessor?
The Hard Way
This is so simple, that i t may be
difﬁcult for the novice to grasp. You
use machine code, a code consisting
entirely o f "numbers", and the tiny
microprocessor chip, which contains a
program all on its own, takes those
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
13
"numbers" a s  instructions and
executes them.
But, you say, this computing by
numbers business i s  n o t  ve ry
convenient f o r  u s  fallible human
beings. We have to look up every
instruction we want to  give to the
microprocessor, in order to ﬁnd the
right "number", and i f we get the
number wrong -  the microprocessor
may d o  something completely
different. And that may mean curtains
for your program - the machine may
crash_
Contrary t o  popular belief,
machine code programmers too are
human beings. S o  th e y use a
compromise between those dreadful,
boring numbers and the long, drawn-
out instructions used in a high-level
language like Basic.
This halfway-house i s  called
"assembly language".

I
The Solution
Assembly language consists of a very
small number o f simple mnemonics
like "LOA", "STA", "BRK", which
are written in numbered lines, very
much as in a Basic program. These are
then translated into machine code with
the help o f  a  program, called an
"assembler". The assembler simply
looks up the instruction -  let's say
"LDA" -  and ﬁnds th e  proper
machine code for "LOA", for instance
decimal 169. Then it writes the code
into memory, and, when you run the
program, the microprocessor ﬁnds it
and executes it instantly.
These days most machine code
programmers a re  really assembly
programmers. Only in the ancient days
of computers (some 15 years ago),
were there extraordinary human
beings, who spent their time, making
up long lists of binary numbers and
then painstakingly feeding them into
the computer -  n o t even vi a  a
keyboard, but by tossing a series of
switches, each representing a binary
bit.
Today we've got keyboards and
assembler programs. You possess the
keyboard already, i f you haven't got
an assembler yet, you should get
yourself one, because in this series of
articles you will learn how to write
machine code programs in assembly
language.
Task 1
Instead of adding more theory. I'd like
to start the ball rolling by considering
straight away a practical programming
task.
We want to print the character A
on to the screen and we want to do it
entirely in machine code.
In all likelihood, you already know
that o n  th e  C64 you can poke
characters directly on to the screen. On
page 132-134 of your manual you'll
ﬁnd a list of characters and the value
which you have t o  use fo r each

character to get it on to the screen.
But what does it really mean, to
"poke" a character on to the screen?
There i s  a n  area reserved i n
memory (normally starting from
decimal 1024), which is "wired" to the
screen output i n such a  way, that
everything contained in these locations
is echoed on to the screen. If you put a
1 into location 1024, you'll get an A
printed on the left top corner of the
screen.
If your CM still contains the old
ROM, you might not see the A ,
because it is printed with the paper-
colour as ink-colour. But it is there, as
you can prove by homing the cursor to
the top left corner.
You may know all this already. But
there is, buried underneath it, a very
i
understanding of the workings of the
microprocessor.
Input - Processing - Output
What I have described above is also
called "output", and the important
thing to realise here, is that you can
make things happen by writing data to
certain locations either inside the
computer, as in the above example, or
outside the computer,as you would do,
when you save something on to disk or
channel output to the printer.
Basic programmers forget this fact
of life, because its all done for them. As
a prospective ma ch i n e  c o d e
programmer you have to  become
aware of it. which means in practice,
you have to know, where things are in
the computer.
No, you do not have to become
involved i n  chip technology. You

merely have to know such things, as
that the screen memory starts at 10.24,
the colour memory starts at 55296,
SID's registers start at 54272 etc. And,
for people like myself, who do not
believe i n  ﬁlling their heads with
numbers, it means that you have to
know, from which book or magazine
you can get that information. If you
don't let yourself be intimidated by the
technical jargon, i t's a s  easy a s
knowing that Bognor Regis lies on the
south coast o f  England and n o t
somewhere in the South o f France
(I've looked that up too!).
Now enter th e  6510 micro-
processor, the real computer. which
does all the work.
All the 6510 ever does can be
described in one sentence. It gets a byte
from somewhere in the computer, does
something with it, and puts the result
back, either where it came from or
somewhere else in the computer.
This very simple sequence we can
describe as: "INPUT- PROCESSING
- OUTPUT".
How ca n  w e  n o w  g e t t h e
microprocessor to write, a 1 (which
stands for the letter A) to location
1024?
Entering the 6510
First, you have to know, that the
microprocessor has locations all of its
own. These locations are quite special,
compared t o  th e  run-of-the-mill
locations in the rest of the computer.
They are called "registers" and are not
used for long-term storage, but act
instead as a sort of gateway through
which a l l  t h e  d a ta  which t h e
microprocessor mu st process, i s
syphoned.
A useful comparison here is the
human heart which acts as a pump,
sucking blood into its chambers and
pushing it out again, so that it will
circulate all round the body.
The microprocessor, which is truly
the heart o f  the computer system,
functions in a very similar way. Bytes
of data are moved into its chambers
("registers") -  "INPUT" -  and are
then moved out again - "OUTPUT" -
and that's precisely what makes the
computer tick.
But, to expand on our comparison,
the microprocessor is not only the
heart of the system, but also its liver.
Because it does not only make the data
go round, i t also processes it at the

the
same time, as the human liver puriﬁes
the blood.
The Accumulator
The most important register o f the
6510 i s  t h e  A-register o r  th e
"accumulator". In a way, that's the
liver. A s  i ts  name suggests, th e
accumulator i s  used, t o  add and
substract numbers.
Then there are the X -  and Y-
register, which are called the "index-
registers", because they are mainly
used as pointers to mark out a table of
locations.
These three registers are the most
important ones of the 6510, as far as
the programmer is concerned. There
are some others, which are also quite
important to him, and then there are
some more, which are only important
to the internal workings o f  the
processor a n d  o ve r which th e
programmer has no inﬂuence at all.
We will deal with all this more
thoroughly i n  due time, now let's
return to our programming task.
Inputting a Byte
Listing I gives you the assembly listing
which, when assembled, will perform
the task we have set ourselves.
This is also called the "source ﬁle".
The machine code, which t h e
assembler produces, i s  called th e
"object code". Once you have your
object code, you may in theory dispose
of the source ﬁle, because th e
microprocessor has no need for it. But
in practice you are wise to keep it for
future reference.
Now let's look a bit closer at the
source ﬁle in listing I, ignoring the ﬁrst
line for the time being, and going
straight for the "action", starting from
line 20.
LDA is one o f those assembly
language mnemonics, which we have
already mentioned. I t  stands fo r
"Load the Accumulator with".
The meaning of this should by now
be quite clear. We are instructing the
microprocessor to load (INPUT) a
byte of data into its A-register, or, to
stick Nrith our allegory, we are getting
the heart-pump to stick some blood
into its main chamber.
The instruction LDA is also called
an "op-code", which is short fo r
operational code, because this is the
instruction itself.
Useful as this instruction is, on its
P R O G R A M M I N G
own it would be quite useless to the
microprocessor w i t h o u t  t h e
information given after it — in our case
" 1 "  is the data, or the blood itself,
which we want the microprocessor to
circulate. It is called the "operand",
and in our little program we are giving
the o p e ra n d  d i r e c tl y  t o  t h e
microprocessor, that is, the data, we
want to process is contained in the
instruction. This is called immediate
addressing,
On other occasions we tell the
microprocessor, rather rudely "Get it
Yourself!", and then we need to tell it,
from which location it can get it. This
means, that the operand contains now
the address of a location and not a data
byte.
Generally, this is called "absolute
addressing", but there are different
ways i n  which we can point the
microprocessor a t the location we
want. More about this very important
subject later.
In assembly language we use in
both cases the instruction LDA, but
the machine code or object code, into
which the assembler will translate the
instruction, will be different, because
the microprocessor has to know that
what follows is either a byte of data or
a location. To make it quite clear to the
assembler, what assembly we want, we
preﬁx a data byte with the " # " sign
and leave the address of a location
without a preﬁx. This is a convention
which you'll ﬁnd i n  all assembly
listings or source ﬁles
Outputting a Byte
In the next line of our little program
(line 30), we do the exact opposite of
what we did i n the ﬁrst line. We
instruct the 6510 to output a byte of
data to location 1024 in the computer,
which is of course the beginning of
screen memory. That is, to get the
heart of our computer system to pump
blood into the veins.
STA stands f o r  :"Store th e
contents of the A-register in".
In this case the operand can o f
course be nothing but a location, even
though,as we will see later, there are
again different ways in which we can
express the location.

code I, which stands for the letter A,
put it into its A-register (INPUT) and
move it from there to its destination
(OUTPUT).
In this case we didn't do any
processing inside the 6510. All we did
was a simple IN/OUT process, but if
you have grasped this, you'll have
already begun to  understand how
things are made to  happen i n  a
practical way in microprocessor-land.
Assembly Language versus Basic
But you may muse at this moment: "Is
this assembly language lark not even
more long-winded than the simple
Basic command, 'POKE 1024, I '?
After all, it takes two lines for one
lousy Basic instruction!".
On the surface it looks like this. But
those two lines o f source code are
translated by the assembler into only
ﬁve bytes of object code, and those ﬁve
bytes th e  microprocessor executes
immediately, and there i s nothing
more. In  Basic, as we have already
said, it has to go all around the house,
in order to do the thing: First, it has to
interpret the command POKE itself,
then it has to translate "1024" from the
ASCII-string, in which it appears on
the screen, into a more useful low-
byte/high-byte sequence. Then it has
to process the comma, which acts as a
deliminator, and then it has to do the
same thing with the I afterwards. Only
then is it ready to do at last, what we
did in our program!
You might ﬁnd this confusing,
when starting to program in assembly
language. Assembly listings have a
habit o f growing very quickly! And
you'll think to yourself. "This will take
ages to do!". Don't let yourself' be
fooled! E x c e p t i f  y o u  w r i t e
outrageously badly organized machine
code, it will do it in the wink of an eye.
The Program Counter
Let's now look at what the ﬁrst line of
our program is all about.
In o r d e r  t o  s u p p l y  t h e
microprocessor with instructions to
keep i t  busy. I t  would be highly
impractical to feed it each instruction
separately. For a start, the 6510 is able
to process about h a l f a  million
instructions in one second.
Instead we write a series of such
machine code instructions into a
certain area of the computer memory,
tell the microprocessor, where those

I
instructions start, and then leave it to
get on with it.
For this purpose the 6510 chip has
a very important register, called the
program counter. This is the only
register of the 6510 which can hold a
16-bit number, that is a number in the
range of zero to 65535. All the other
registers can only hold eight numbers,
and that means numbers in the range
of zero to 255.
The reason, why the program
counter has to be 16-bit is that it holds
the l o c a ti o n  o n  w h i c h  t h e
microprocessor i s working a t any
given moment, and since the C64
contains 64k or 65535 locations, the
program counter has to be able to
address all of them.
This is what happens, when the
microprocessor executes a  machine
code program.
First, the start location o f  the
program is loaded into the program
counter (in our example: 49152, which
is the beginning of user-RAM). Then
the microprocessor gets the byte which
is contained in this location and loads
it into one of those special registers
over which the programmer has no
inﬂuence whatsoever - the instruction
register. This is to allow it to ﬁnd out in
advance, what to do with the next byte.
Will it be a data-byte or the address of
a location, where data has to  be
fetched from? Is that location in zero-
page (locations zero to 255 in the
computer, which need only the low-
byte to specify them) or will it be an
absolute address, which needs a low
byte and a high byte? Or might this
particular instruction have no operand
after it at all (implied addressing), so
that the next byte will be another
instruction?
Now the microprocessor bumps
the program counter up by one and
gets the next byte, with which, at this
point, it already knows what to do. If it
is a data byte, it goes into the data
register - another one of those secret
registers -  i f it is the address o f a
location, i t goes into the "address
register".
If the address is absolute or 16-bit,
the 6510 repeats the above procedure
(including incrementing the program
counter) one more time in order to get
the high byte too.
Now i t is ready to  execute the
whole instruction, while the program
counter is already pointing a t the
beginning of the next instruction.
P R O G R A M M I N G
Initiating
There are two important morals in this
story. Firstly, you have to  tell the
microprocessor where t o  s ta r t
executing, and secondly, you have to
tell it where to end.
If you don't give it the right start
location, it will begin to execute from
that location, all right, but i t will
interpret the ﬁrst byte it ﬁnds as an
instruction, even i f it is a data-byte,
because this is way. the microproces-
sor is programmed!
And i f  you neglect to  tell the
microprocessor where t o  sto p
executing, it will just go on executing
ad inﬁnitum. In  the end your only
remedy might be, t o  unplug the
machine, because the microprocessor
will be so busy executing all this
nonsense that it will not be able to
react to the keyboard. That means that
the machine is out of your control.
Pseudo-Instructions
In line 10 of our program we set the
address (49152) where we want our
program to start. We do this with what
is called a  pseudo-instruction o r
assembler-instruction.
"ORG" (short for "origin") is not
part of assembly language because we
are not giving an instruction which is
to be assembled into machine code.
Instead we are merely telling the
assembler to write the following code
to an area o f memory starting with
location 49152.
After w e have assembled o u r
source ﬁle (and have saved it on to tape
or disk, we can run it by giving the
Basic instruction SYS 49152.
Now the operating system of the
C64 saves certain important variables,
needed for later, puts the start location
49152 into the program counter of trhe
6510 and tells it "Go!".
The microprocessor now executes
your program, while the operating
system rests. From this points onwards
the machine is at your ﬁngertips, to do
with it as you please! In a way, it's not
really the Commodore 64 as you know
it a n y more. It's  64k o f  R A M
completely at your mercy! It's you and
the n a k e d  ma ch i n e . Endless
computing possibilities are opening up
to you -  some you haven't even
dreamt about, and all executed at
maximum speed!
But, beware. Machine code also

means, no error checking! If you get
things wrong, the machine won't
explode, but it might crash! And this,
while n o t lethal, can b e  mighty
frustrating!
Stopping the 6510
All good things come to an end, as my
grandmother, who had a thing against
platitudes, never told me. Sooner or
later you'll have to return into the safe
haven of the operating system, unless
you have by then designed your own
operating system.
This is what the last line of our
program is all about. It contains a RTS
instruction and th a t i s  short fo r
"Return from Subroutine". It's very
similar t o  t h e  Basic RETURN
command.
Why return from subroutine?
The operating system treats all
user-designed machine code routines
as a subroutine. And before it calls that
subroutine, i t saves the address, to
where th e  microprocessor has t o
return afterwards, in a special area of
memory called the machine stack. We
will deal with the intricacies o f the
machine stack later. Here it is enough
to say that the machine stack is a sort
of o f ﬁc e  s p i k e  w h i c h  t h e
microprocessor uses for all sorts of
safekeeping purposes. Th e  return-
address is simply pushed on to the
stack, and when the processor gets an
RTS instruction, it pops the topmost
address from the stack, loads it into the
program counter a n d  continues
execution as from this address.
In our program example "RTS"
means of course, that it gets an address
within the operating system, so that it
can continue executing again from
within the operating system.
We have successfully returned to
Basic.
Listing 2 is an assembler listing of
the source ﬁle in listing I. Next to each
line number you ﬁnd the address of the
current location, where the assembler
has written the object code, and then
the object code itself. If you study this
listing thoroughly you'll ﬁnd it a useful
illustration to what I have explained
and especially in the section on the
workings of the program counter.
In the next article we will expand
on our programming theme and learn
how to create a loop in machine code. ft

intergalactic farming? You now have a chance to ﬁnd out
how green your ﬁngers actually are Agent Orange is a new
game from A'n'E which is a shoot 'em up with a difference.
You play the role of a ﬂying farmer working for the
Intergalactic Agricultural Research Establishment (IARE
for short). The aim is to battle with the aliens and cultivate
eight planets to ﬁnd a super weedkiller (yes, you've guessed,
it's codenamed Agent Orange). Succeed in this mission and
you'll become a hero among the farmers galaxy-wide.
You start the game with one mothership and eight
daughter vessels (1 don't know where daddy got to). You can
then head off towards the ﬁrst planet armed with seed pods
and bullets.
You don't have to dig holes to plant your seeds. space
farmers are a bit more advanced than that. You simply have
to tly over the ground and drop the seed pods which will
miraculously grow and ripen before your very eyes.
Unfortunately you are not the only one using the soil, there is

competition from the aliens and their seeds and from the
dreaded weeds (yes, they even get their roots in up there).
Alien seeds seem to grow far quicker than earthly ones but
fortunately you can burn these down by ﬁring at them.
Once the seeds you have planted turn red you can collect
them but they should be left a while to multiply which will
increase your crop. Unfortunately there's nothing yoU can
do about the natural weedy vegetation so you have to plant
your seeds quickly before all the room is ﬁlled up. Alter
you've grown all you can, collect your produce and head for
home.
If you have made a reasonable proﬁt you can trade your
old ship in for a bigger. faster one. This will obviously be an
advantage for reaching your destination quicker and you
will also ﬁt more crops in the hold,
This game is an improvement on the general shoot 'em
up games in that there is a purpose in what you are doing. It
isn't just a matter of shooting at aliens until they are all gone,
but you are ﬁring at them to gain access to the next planet.

during the cold evenings, then you are in luck, You can now
enjoy playing three fast moving indoor games, normally
only found in pubs and leisure centres without venturing out

of the house. No, you don't need to extend the house or
knock out walls; simply load in Advance's new game Indoor
Sports and settle down for a few hours of exhilarating fun.
Even better, ask a few friends round (get them to bring some
drinks), and yOU could have a tournament_
There are three games included on the disk which is very
good value for money. The games are bowling (as in 10 pin).
darts and air hockey. There are very easy instructions for
each game but carrying them out successfully is another
matter.
The ﬁrst game, howling, shows an option screen where
you can choose the weight o f  the ball (don't pull any
muscles), and the slickness of the alley. You can also decide
at which level you want to play.
If you have never been bowling before, believe me it's not
as easy as it looks. The hardest thing is keeping your ball out
of the gutters which run on either side of the alley, they seem
to draw the balls like a magnet. Once you have mastered that
you can concentrate on ﬂattening the pins which stand in
triangular formation at the far side of the alley, The joystick
controls the position of your man and the direction of the
ball.
The only thing that remains for you to do is remember to
release the ball as it is swung forward. If you fail to do this
you fall ﬂat on your face (it's quite embarassing), If you want
to put some spin on the ball move the joystick to the left or
right as you let the ball go. I'm not going to tell you which
spins the ball which way (basically because I couldn't work it
out),
Once you've tired of the bowling you can return to the
main menu and go on to the more sedate game of darts.
When it has loaded you are again presented with an option
screen where you have a choice of 301, 501 and 701 games.
You can also decide whether or not to start and ﬁnish the
game with a double. The dart is positioned by moving the
joystick to the left or right. To maintain the position you
have chosen hold the ﬁre button in, this will put the angle
meter into action which determines the size of the arc that
the dart moves. Once you are happy with this release the
button. The only other thing to set is the power of the throw,
This again is set with the ﬁre button. As this is completed the
picture changes and you will see a scruffy looking yob
throwing the dart for you.

fun. You move your -

to give the idea a week's trial and it's up to you to see that
everything goes according to plan.
Although you can move Floyd normally, performing
other actions involves a series of menus (no pun intended)
and two control arms. There is a list of recipes for you to
consult in your slack moments. Ingredients can be found in
cupboards as well as the fridge and there are plates and
glasses to be picked up.

deliver the food whilst i t  is  hot, it  cools and spoils.
Customers get very unhapy is you take too long or get their
orders wrong and start throwing furniture about, To solve
this problem, you have a supply of three emergency dinners
to serve up.
Floyd's left arm does the picking up and cooking whilst
his right arm is  used for  picking up serving boxes or
delivering them. When you become proﬁcient in some of the
actions, you can actually program Floyd to perform a given
sequence but be warned, he remembers your mistakes as
well.

everything else is a derivative of one or other of these. It is
beginning to look as if  the same situation applies to the

computer industry. Remember Breakout? Where you
control a bat and try to knock bricks out of a wall. Now, try
and guess what Krackom is about.
Admittedly, comparing Krackout with Breakout is like
putting a Ford Anglia next to a Lotus but there are deﬁnite
similarities somewhere along the evolutionary tree.
The action takes place over some hundred different
screens with the simple objective of removing all the bricks.
It is not quite that easy though. To hinder you, there are
large numbers of aliens that try to knock the ball out of your
path or even worse, freeze your bat altogether. As you
progress even further, a jolly little ogre promptly chews your
ball and spits the pips back at you!
You do have some weapons at your disposal though.
Some of the blocks, instead of disappearing when hit, roll
over to reveal a bonus brick. Hit this and one of several
things can happen to you. Your bat can expand to double its
normal length or you can obtain a protective wall behind
you. An extra man is always useful or how about the ball
sticking to your bat so you can aim at those tricky bricks
stuck in the corners? Then there are bombs and missiles.
Each bonus brick is only on screen for a short period of time
and each bonus lasts until you pick up the next one.
The game comes complete with a fully comprehensive
option screen allowing you to change to left or right handed
play, after the speeds and colour etc. There is also the
promise of another 100 screens and there is a cheat mode but
you can discover that for youself.
Krakow is very slickly presented but is just lacking a
certain something in addictiveness that would turn it into a
really top notch game

TERROR OF THE DEEP
D
creatures rise from the water at night and terrorise the locals.
Your job is to seek them out and kill them using a peculiar
diving bell.
Unfortunately, the owner of the bell dies just before he
can explain its controls so your ﬁrst job is to make sense of
the handles, wheels and pumps that litter the control panel.
Before you dive you must point your pencil to the part of the
Loch you wish to explore so that the surface ship knows
where to drop you.
Below the surface you will soon be able to control the
depth by operating the ballast switch, steer left and right and
control your speed as long as you've got fuel and oxygen. If
the oxygen gets low you can always pump some more but for
fuel you have to return to the surface ship.
Your submersible is ﬁtted with three weapon systems
that you can switch between to defend yourself with spears.
bombs, that you must detonate from a safe distance, and an
electric ﬁeld. These are effective against most ﬁsh but what
about sea-fairing aliens? You'll know soon enough. as
suddenly they'll be upon you and you must get them or
they'll surely get you.
Clear the Loch and you'll be a local hero. Fail and the
reporters standing by will have a story. Either way you'll be
back for more,

ALIENS
R E V I E W S
A
based on Ripley's return to Archeron, The last time she was
there the rest of the crew of the ill-fated Nostromos were
chomped by an alien. Now she's going back to face a planet
full of them.
Since her last visit a colony has been set up and wiped out
and you've been asked to lead a commando assault,
The British game concentrates on this part of the ﬁlm
and centres around your group's efforts to survive. The
American version actually consists of six mini games strung
together by the ﬁlm's plot.
You begin the game in an updated version of Activision's
Master of the Lamps, only this time you're guiding a drop
ship down to the planet' surface. In part two you must guide
four of your marines back to the AK'. (Armoured Personnel
Carrier) by guiding them through an Alien infested maze. In
part three you must hold them off with a ﬂame thrower while
your colleagues cut through a door that will lead you into the
air duet and part four sees you scrambling through a Pacrnan
style maze.
Once you've survived all that, you're not content with
safety, instead you want to be a hero and set off to rescue
Newt (the cumpulsory cute kid). To add to your troubles,
you've only got 17 minutes before the whole planet blows up,
and Newt's trapped in the Alien nest, which means trudging
back through the maze, only this time you've got a range
locator to guide you.
Wearing only a forklift like robotic exoskeleton power
loader, you must engage the Queen alien in a ﬁnal battle to
save you, Newt and the rest of humanity.
The game is typically American with superb graphic
cartoon style introductions followed b y  "stick man"
animation.
Overall, I prefered the atmosphere of the British version
but if you like shoot 'em ups you need look no further for a
great "bug hunt"!

painstakingly producing simulations, accurate down to the

Tomahawk is especially awkward in that it is simulating
an attack helicopter. As anyone with any knowledge of
ﬂying should know, helicopters are a  whole order o f
magnitude of difﬁculty ahead of ﬁxed wing aircraft.
With all this complexity you need about 20 keyboard
controls to ﬂy the thing and keep a watch on almost 30 on-
screen instruments. Very confusing.
The simulation itself is very good. The speed is about
right, the graphics reasonable, and accuracy of simulation
high. This has got to be the state o f the art in ﬂight
simulators.
If you really like ﬂight simulators then this one's for you.
My only real gripe is that as a glider pilot I can't climb up to
maximum altitude, turn off the engine, and do what I know
best as easily as I can on other ﬂight simulators.
Also the game will n o t ru n  o n  some pre-1985

FUTURE KNIGHT
T
catapillars stand between the good knight Sir Randolph and
his beloved Amelia,
She has been captured by the evil Spegbott the Tenible
and you must bravely attempt to rescue her. Wearing your
Omnibolt Mark IV attack suit and carrying a few extra lives
you answer an inter-dimensional distress signal and arrive
onboard the SS Rustbucket. You must ﬁrst ﬁnd an exit to get
to the planet's surface then ﬁnd Spegbott's castle and a ﬁnal
battle with Speghott and his evil Henchodrold.
Your ﬁrst task is to stay alive but dying is far easier as you
are swamped in defence droids, energy draining pools and
slides that slither you to your doom.
The Rustbucket, and indeed the whole planet, is made
from a series of platforms, ladders and slides that our hero
must leap around as he searches for a way out and objects to
help in his quest. Unfortunately, you can carry only one
object and one weapon type around with you at any one time

so you should be prepared to do some juggling.
Finding a bomb is a great help as it not only destroys all
the critters attacking you but also gives your energy a much
needed boost. A confuser stuns the defence droids for a few
seconds which should give you a chance to get away perhaps
with the help of the platform spell that creates a platform
from nowhere or the bridge spell that will give you safe
passage over a bubbling pool.
You will also need to acquire the safe pass and securo
keys to  open locked exits that will lead you to  the
I lenchodroid when only the invaluable destruct spell will
save the day.
All the action is presented with some incredible graphics
including Sir Randolph (who waves whenever you start a
new screen to let you know where you are before it's too
late), the slithering array of robots and droids that look as
deadly as they actually are. A tremendous mixture of arcade
adventure, shoot 'em up with an added dose of platform
panic.

ESCAPE FROM SINGE'S CASTLE
S
screens from the coin-op classic since less than half were
included in the original game.
Having leapt off plummeting disks, defeated hordes of
ghouls, skulls and snakes and ﬁnally slain the Dragon Singe
in part one, you have rescued the fair Daphne. What do you
mean you didn't get that far? Go back and ﬁnish i t
immediately as the daring Dirk is off in search o f new
adventures. The dauntless Dirk has returned to the Dragon's
Lair to ﬁnd a new monster in control in the shape of the scaly
Lizard King and eight new challenges to block his path to a
pot of gold and freedom.
The ﬁrst hazard is a suicidal journey full of boulders and
whirl pools that must be avoided by following the marked
path. Flashes suddenly appear showing you the direction to

take but your reactions must be quick or you'll be grounded
on the rocks. This is surprisingly difﬁcult especially when
there's only three possible directions (left, right and forward
and countless lives will be lost on the rocks or down the
roving whirpools.
By the time you've completed the watery journey your
next challenge will have loaded in using the same play as you
load technique that worked well in the original.
As you dry yourself off you're greeted by a giant boulder
that hurtles down the slippery corridor towards you.
Naturally you take off in the opposite direction but must
avoid the holes and boulders that block your path as if you
slip the boulder will get you.
Survive that and you must negotiate the traps that are
packed into the Throne Room, such as the blazing balls of
electric ﬁre, circle of suspicion and a ﬁery hand before an
encounter with the Lizard King. The onl_v problem is that
you've lost your sword. Find that and you stand a chance of
surviving to ride a magical legless horse as it careers around
corridors, the self explanatory Doom Dungeon, the now you
see it. now YOU don't ﬂoor of the Mosaic Room and a ﬁnal
scramble past the deadly Mud Monsters.
As in  the original most o f  the gameplay involves
pushing the joystick in the right direction as the right time
with reactions being the key to success although occasional
use of the grey matter is required to plan your next move.
The result is  a highly addictive game that has been

hat do games such asImpossible Mission. Monty on the
W
Run and Cauldron /I have in common? They're just three
of the incredible number of platform games that spawned
from what appeared to be an incredibly limited format.
Three years ago platform games developed from mere copies
of the Coin-op Kong and grew into a class of their own
thanks mainly to an Atari game called Miner 2049er and the
UK Spectrum copy Manic Miner. Manic Miner and Jet Set
Willy were later converted for the C64 but failed as they
didn't take advantage o f  the machine's superior colour,
sound and sprite capabilities. The following did, became
bestsellers and are still among my favourite games.
Impossible Mission
The undisputed king of the platform games that swept all the
awards when it was imported ﬁrst by CBS and then by US
Gold. I t  was the ﬁrst game to stun its players with the
synthesised speech and laughing of the evil Dr  Elgin. He's
the mad scientist who's threatening to blow up the world and
you have to stop him. However this involves searching every
object in his 25 room complex while avoiding the attention
of the laser ﬁring patrolling robots.

Platform games are a style in their own
right. In this tribute to an art form, we
look at some of the most inﬂuential games
of the last couple of years.
By Tony Hetherington
Wizard
wi:ard
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
26
Impossible Mission featured ﬁendish puzzles, incredible
animation (including the character that then starred in
Summer Games and Summer Gates II) and stunning sounds
ranging from the bleeps and hums of the robots to your
metallic footsteps.
Impossible Mission expanded the platform game format
into an arcade adventure and created a game that would be a
hit even if  it were released tomorrow.
Wizard was ﬁrst touted by CRL, then by  Ariolasoft but
neither did it justice as it's a superb platform variant. The
object of each screen is to collect a key and take it to a lock to
gain entry to the next level. Your route is strewn with trduble
from the ﬂashes that pursue you to the ﬁres, disappearing
ladders and ropes that block your way.
Played at a variety of levels Wizard added the use of
player spells such as in visabil ity. freeze or ﬁreballs that were
won when you found a key and might just get the lock in tact.
Add to that a screen constructor that can be used to alter
existing screens o r design your own.

Bounty Bob Strikes Back
The sequel to the original Miner 2049er, Bounty Bob from US
Gold is a typically addictive platform game packed with
impossible leaps and ﬁendish traps designed to rob you of
your last life just before you reach the next level.
Each screen features a different ﬁendish mechanism that
you must use to cover every platform and so complete it
within the time limit. These include hoist lifts, transporters,
suction tubes, granary lifts and gravity lifts that are patrolled
by multi-coloured nasties. Luckily you can ﬁnd objects that
turn these nasties green for a few seconds. When they're
green. that's when you can get them.
Each level demands skill, timing and precision jumping
as one mistake could cost y ou a  life. This isn't easy
particularly when one screen is aptly named 101 jumps!
Cauldron
In Cauldron II you play a pumpkin that must bounce around
a wizard's castle avoiding the guards, ghosts and goulish
severed heads and object that get in your way.
Help comes in the form of sparklers that top up your
rapidly depleting energy and ﬂashing objects that give you
extra power that you'll need to complete the game.

Controlling the pumpkin is the route tosuccess as timing
your joystick presses decides the level and direction of your
bounce and whether you land safely on a  platform or
plummet to your doom.
This game is packed with atmosphere from the crawling
monsters to the evil cackle that accompanies the end of
another failed game. My favourite is undoubtedly the statues
holding plates of sparklers that tip you into oblivion if you
don't bounce back in time.
That's just the tip of  the iceberg as other favourites
include the true two player action of Broderbund's Castles of
Dr Creep, the cartoon style action of First Star's Frakl, 150
screens of redeﬁnable Lode Runner action and the leaping
action of Datasoft's Bruce Lee and ZOITO,
The best way to track down these stars is probably
through compilations that are now swamping the shop
shelves although there are signs that the good old platform
game is making a comeback through games such as A uf
Wiedersehn MOW)

Hercules
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
28
If you need persistence to play Monty then you need sheer
courage to play the new budget game Hercules from Alpha
Omega as the platforms appear where you don't expect
them, disappear from under your feet and even burst into
ﬂames! Some screens begin completey blank and you have to
itake a leap into oblivion and hope that something soft
breaks your fall.
The game is based (loosely) on the 12 labours of Hercules
which means that the 50 screens are divided into 12 groups.
Finish one screen and you progress to the next one in that
group. You have to complete all 50 to ﬁnish the game.
Luckily, you attempt the groups in a random order so you
needn't get stuck on a difﬁcult screen. Instead you get stuck
on 12 difﬁcult screens.
Monty on the Run
The third and best in the Monty series of platform games
from Gremlin combined superb game action with Rob
Ilubbard's best music.
Monty Mole now on the run begins in the house and tries
to escape through the escape tunnel by avoiding the deadly
plungers, incredible array of nasties that range from ﬂying
teapots, ﬂapping gloves to ambling big nosed monsters.
Meanwhile the action is accompanied by the catchiest tune
you're ever likely to hear on a C64,
Monty has remained a mystery to most of its players still
struggling to get the poor Mole out of the house never mind
on the run. To add to your troubles you have to choose a
selection of objects before you begin that ae essential to
completing the game. Unfortunately
out which objects you need is by trial and error.

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
1.3 and N. You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how lo ng
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of E6,00 for disk and £4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation fo r the programs is supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INEONET LTD, Times House, 179 The Marlowes, Hemel
Hempstead, Herts. HP! I BB.
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C I6  and Plus/4
cassettes. However programs for these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
CUD

This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.
READERS SERVICE
Please Note
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program. we do not put disk only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

The
mage System
Now all you budding Andy Warhols can
create masterpieces using your
Commodore 64s.
By Stuart Cook
W
the market for the CM, you would think that there would be
little room for any more. Not so. CRL has just released a
second graphics program into the market place.
The Image System, does contain all of the usual painting
and drawing facilities that we have come to expect from a
high quality graphics package, however, it  does have a
number of 'extra' features which makes it a little special.
It seems to have become the norm that any program that is
easy to use should be completely controlled by a joystick and
all of the necessary options be selected by using pull down
menus. The Image System is no exception, though you are
required to use just three keys on the keyboard for moving
between menus and the drawing area.
The actual layout of the package is excellent. The screen
is split into two sections, one part shows what is happening
on that section of the graphics screen while the other displays

the menus, the colours in use and a magniﬁed picture of the
area surrounding the cursor etc. You may think that only
being able to see half the screen is offputting and makes it
difﬁcult to draw anything. Actually the opposite is true as
the programmers hav e been q u it e  clever i n  t h e ir
manipulation of the menu.
Jumping between the menu and editing displays is again
simply a matter of pressing a single key. While in the menu
area moving the joystick around moves a pointer to the
various options, the ﬁre button being used to make changes,
pull down the various menus etc.
The menu displays such information as the x.y position
of your cursor, a meter which shows how much image
storage space is left. — more on this later — the texture and
brush that you are using the colour palette and how you are

manipulating the colours. The display is extremely clear and
very easy to understand.
In Use
G R A P H I C S  S O F T W A R E
Selecting the various menus is simplicity in itself. Move the
pointer to the name of the menu that you require, press ﬁre
and keep the button held down. The relevant menu will now
appear on the screen. Moving the joystick around highlights
the different options within the menu, When the correct
function is lit release the button and the necessary operation
is performed.
Probably the best way to give details of this package is to
go through each of the menus in turn detailing each function.
The Draw Menu is where you can manipulate the type of
drawing that you are using.
Brush Paint allows you to draw on the screen using the
current brush type and selected texture.
Spray Paint allows you to use a 'spray can' to colour in an
area of the screen, the pressure of the spray and width of the
spray are adjustable.
Flood Fill is a standard ﬁll function that colours in an
enclosed area of the screen.
Area Colour allows you to change the colours within a
rectangular area of the screen.
Colour Scheme is similar to the above option. This allows
you to perform such functions as changing all the red colour
to blue etc.
Colour Copy lets you copy a rectangular area of colour to
another area of the screen.
Single Line enables you to draw a straight line between
any two points on the screen. One nice feature is that the line
is drawn in the currently selected texture and brush type.
Stitch Line is similar to above except that the line is made
up of a series of dots.
Ray Line allows you to draw lines of differing lengths
horn the same origin.
Ellipse allows you to create circles or ellipses of any size.
As with line the ellipse is drawn in the current texture and
brush.
Ellipse Fill is similar to the above except that the centre of
the shape is ﬁlled with the current texture.
Box, as its name suggests, allows you to draw a box on
the screen while Box Fill does the same but ﬁlls in the centre
of the shape.

The next menu that you come up against is the Image menu.
This is one of the most powerful menus of the package and
one that makes the package stand out from many others,
The Image ,Vstem has the ability to store and manipulate
images which you can grab from the screen and store in
memory for retrieval at a later time. Up to a maximum of 64
images can be stored in memory but the actual total is
limited by the size of the ones stored since vou only have so
much storage memory available, the afore mentioned menu
shows how much is left.
The Select Image option front this menu allows you to
specify one of the images. It is possible to give a name to an
image allowing you to ﬁnd it at a later time with ease.
Deﬁne Image allows you to select any rectangular area of
the screen as an image.
Delete Image erases the currently selected image from the
storage memory. A nice touch is that o n  should choose this
option you are asked if you are sure before the delete takes
place.
Scale Image allows you to shrink or expand the selected
image.
Distort Image also allows you to manipulate the image
selected. I loweyer. this differs from the above since it allows
you to *twist' the box into any shape you like. It is even
possible to cross the shape over itself. I must confess to not
having found a use for the above function but it is great funl
Print Image will print the selected image on to the screen
at the speciﬁed position.
The type of brush that you are using is selected from the
brush menu. The hnage System includes 32 user-deﬁnable
brush templates. Brush designs can be 'grabbed' from the
screen extremely easy and placed into one of the 32 brush
slots. Save and Load options allow you to store your designs
on to tape or disk for use in other pictures. It is possible to
deﬁne where the centre of the brush should be. This makes
positioning the brush in a particular position much easier.
Textures are the patterns that you actually draw in.
There are 64 different textures available and again these can

G R A P H IC S  S O F T W A R E
be 'grabbed' off the screen and saved to tape or disk. All of
the drawing functions of The Image.Sistem are carried out in
the currently selected texture.
Should you require text on your screen The Image System
allows you to store up to 90 different characters. It is pOssible
to 'grab' characters off the screen and make them any size
from one pixel up to 32 pixels wide by 48 pixels high.
Getting it Out
When you have ﬁnished drawing your creative masterpiece
then you will no doubt want to produce a printed copy of it.
The Image System provides facilities for dumping the screen
The Manual
to either a Commodore printer or an Epson compatible
printer connected to the user port. The image can be printed
in two different sizes and the provision for turning the
printers auto line feed on and off is also present.
The ﬁnal menu option is the Special Menu. This is where
you can change the colour mode between hi-res and multi-
colour, wiping the screen and adjusting the cursor speed.
Accompanying the package is a small, but informative,
manual o f  12 pages. I n this, all o f  the functions of  the
program are explained in detail. What is good to see is a full
explanation of how the pictures are stored. What is even
better is that a sample program shows you how to LOAD in
the pictures from outside The Image System is included in the
manual, something that is usually lacking in programs of
this sort.
The Image System scores extremely highly when compared
with many of the graphics packages on the market, though
there are some that offer comparable functions and are as
easy to use. However, it must be said that The Image Systen
is one of the best graphics programs available for the C64.

Lower Case
Graphics
A
C16 will know that there are in effect
two character sets. To switch between
these you press the Commodore key
and shift key or print characters 14 and
14
When i t comes to the graphics
modes however, for some reason we
are only allowed to use one o f the
character sets — the one which contains
upper case alpha characters. The
Plus/4 and CI6 have some versatile
and powerful graphics commands, but
this inability to print the lower case
characters when in graphics mode has
always annoyed me slightly. I think a
graphics display with a  mixture o f
upper and lower case alpha characters
looks superior to one with only upper
case.
I have discovered that it is an easy
matter to rectify this situation and
have both the character sets at your
disposal when using any o f  the
graphics modes.
Lower Case
The data for both character sets for the
Pitts/4 and CI6 is held in ROM in
addresses SD000 to SD7FT (53248 to
55295) and pointers in RAM enable
this data to be used by the screen editor
etc. when in low resolution text mode.
There is however a separate pointer
in R AM which i s used to  enable
character data to  be accessed and
printed on the graphics screen. This
C 1 6 / P L U S / 4 P R O G R A M
Here's a way to improve your graphics by using the
alternative character set.
By D.A. Gardner
pointer is at location S02E4 (740) and
normally contains the valueSDO (208),
which is the high-byte o f the start
address of the character data in ROM.
The routines f o r  printing i n
graphics modes access the ﬁrst half of
the character set data (1024 bytes) thus
limiting the user to the character set
containing u p p e r  case a l p h a
characters.
It is a simple matter to increase the
pointer at location $02E4 to enable the
character set containing lower case

HOLLYWOOD HLLINK
Hollywood Hi/inks is the latest work of art to ﬂow from the
pens of those masters of the genre, Infocom. As the name
suggests, it takes an almighty swipe at the movie industry
and anyone who knows their ﬁlms is going to be guaranteed
a lot of laughs.
Your Uncle, Buddy Burbank and your Aunt Hildegarde
built up an empire based on a very successful series of B-
movies including such never to be forgotten titles as A
Corpse Line, Meltdown o n  E l m  Street and ' Vampire
Penguins. Now they have both died and, as they have no
children of their own, have left their entire estate to you,
their favourite nephew. There is however, one slight catch.
In order to prove your worth, you must ﬁrst discover 10
'treasures' bidden somewhere within their mansion and
grounds. And, you only have one night to do it,
The Burbank mansion, as you remember it from youth.
is full of assorted props from some of the 600 ﬁlms your
uncle made, Ile also had a penchant for practical jokes so
you have a fair idea of what to expect.
The house is all locked up and your ﬁrst problem is to
ﬁnd a way in. Outside the front door is a statue that may
provide a  clue. I t  is  o f  Buck Palace, an all-American
mailman who just happens to act like Rambo as he struggles
to deliver the mail. Why does this statue of Buck, armed with
bazooka, machine gunes, grenades and riﬂes etc. rotate to
point in different directions?
All Infocom games are text only hut the text is of such
quality, that pictures could never do it justice. An  d a f t
inputs that you try are quite likely to be greeted with an
equally daft response and this is one of the great charms of

the game — so much better than being greeted with 'you
can't do that' or similar.
The packaging is  excellent with an excellent movie
magazine called Tinsel Town, full of spoof adverts for hair •
restorer and articles about three headed boys and psychotic
gerbils. As with all Infocom games. I can give no higher
recommendation than to suggest that you immediately go
out and buy a copy.

day's investigations. You must discover certain facts within •
a strict time limit before you are allowed to progress, As well
as searching the ship for clues, you also need to talk to the •
crew and other passengers in an attempt to discover the

And a right suspicious bunch they are too! Top of the
suspects must come Carlton Rocksavage, the rival in the
soap industry. Could he have put out duff information about
the relative state of Blane's company? Blanc was always
threatening to kill himself rather than face bankruptcy. You
will need your best detective's note book and pencil at the
ready as the statements are long and you will need to
separate the wheat from the chaff.

adventurers. The plot itself is reasonably well worked and
should provide a  good challenge for  budding amateur
sleuths everywhere.

•\ game based on the second Adrian Mole book/TV series,
our aim is to make Adrian as popular as possible with his
lamily and friends etc.
For any one who has been dead for the last few years,
Adrian Mole is a schoolboy suffering from an overdoes of
adolescent'. Major  problems o f  the day include an ever
increasing number of spots, lack of inches below the belt and
a girlfriend who, whilst admiring Adrian's intellectual
ability, is not over keen on developing the physical side of
their relationship. Add these problems to a background of
parents splitting up and reuniting and a new baby in the
family and it is easy to see why Adrian has so many dilemmas
in his life.
The game is exactly the same format as the original
Adrian Mole game. Pages of his diary are presented and you
are then offered a problem in the form of 'What should
Adrian do now — choose A. B, or C'. Depending on your
answer, the plot develops slightly differently and Adrian's
popularity is affected. Any variations are minor and the
game soon comes back to tile mainline story.
The game comes in  four parts but there is no real
ubstance to it. There is nothing in the story line that isn't in
the book. Try each part a few times choosing different
multiple choice answers and you will cover most of the
G A ME S  R E V I E W

43
variations. I went through the whole game in an hour and a
half and didn't feel in the least like going back to it. My
advice is to buy the books (which are excellent) and save
yourself a few quid on the deal.

When U S G old obtained the licence for  the computer
adventures of He-man it decided to do two games. The ﬁrst
was a poor arcade adventure and this, the second, is a
graphic adventure.
The villain of the piece is of course Skeletor who has
embarked on another attempt to overwhelm Eternia and
become the kingdom's absolute ruler. You play Adam,
Prince of all Eternia, who is better known as He-man wielder
of the Sword of Power and all round good guy.
Your mission is to stop the hordes of Rockbinders that
are gnawing through foundations and are heading for
Eternia. These innocent creatures are being controlled by
hypnotic rays generated by Skeletor's Earthquaker device.
As soon as you feel the initial quakes (and the game has
loaded) you dash to your room and open the door to your
secret room that houses the Sword of Power. Then you're
ready to battle Skeletor, Evil-Lynn and his other minions
that he despatched to get you.
The game features a split screen display that combines
text descriptions a n d  impressive graphics t h a t  a d d
tremendous atmosphere to a Scott Adams style adventure.
Standard adventure commands control your actions and
Q SAVE QLOAD and BONI (Back One Move) commands
ensure that you survive most mishaps.
A good adveture that does Justice to a popular hero and
partly makes up for the disappointing arcade game. E H .

PORTAL
A long, long time in the future, in a place not so far away, a
man returns to Earth after a hundred year mission. You land
011 a desolate planet with no one in sight. After a few days
you ﬁnd the entrance to an underground complex but still
ﬁnd no-one.
Later y ou ﬁnd a n  instruction book  that explains
something about the Worldnet and how to work it if your
Mindlink is malfunctioning. Since you never realised you
had a Mindlink you follow the instructions and are soon into
a massive database system. There you meet Homer, a
storytelling A l (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) unit that seems to
have forgotten everything. As the story unfolds you must
work together to ﬁnd out what happened_
Portal is not a game, it's an electronic novel that's spread
over ﬁve disk sides and by reading the information in the
various dataspaces you can gradually "read" the story.
The main plot of the story is revealed by Homer but only
after you've prodded his memory by looking things up in the
History, Psychology, Geography and Central Processing
units, This also provides you with incredible background
information that could never be conveyed in a book. For
example, if  you heard about an uprising referred to in the
story You could then check the details in the History tile then
look up further ﬁles and graphs on the characteristics of the
main adversaries which would lead to further revelations
from Homer.
I'm about halfway through the story, totally bemused

but also completely hooked_ I have learned something about
a man called Peter Devore who seem t o  have caused
something t o  happed by  entering the wrong dataspace
because he knocked over a cup of orange _Mice yogurt! What
he caused and where everybody's gone is still a mystery but I
better get back as poor old Homer is losing power to his
circuits and if I don't ﬁnd out the truth and get the people
back b e  marooned on an empty plant for ever. T . H .

THE ULTIMATE DISK TOOLKIT FOR 1541/1540
Took IV has, tor some me. been generally recognised as the
best disk toolkit available. The only problem fur Date' was that
it was distributed by someone else!! So when the opportunity
to obtain the rights came our way, we lumped at it And what's_
more, in keeping with our general pricing policy, we are offering it at less than
half the previous selling price. A disk toolkit is an absolute must for the serious
program hacker and MI MI  IV has more features than most for less,

Bananas are growing
Last year saw the launch of our highly
successful Banana reversible disks. Apart
from the IBM PC-AT, these D/Sided
disks suit ALL 5" drives. We know,
because we have them ALL certiﬁed for
both 48tpi & 96 tpi. What is more they
have 2 w/p notches & index holes, so
they are truly reversible if required.
"What about rnicrodisks"
you kept asking. Well here they are. The
family is complete. The plantation's in
full swing.
FREE
We give a banana pen with every ten
disks or microdisks, and should you buy
40 disks (4 ten-packs or 2 crates) OR 20
micmdisks, you will receive a Mercedes
banana truck.
Ofﬁcial orders from pies &
Government bodies are welcome.

graphic capabilities. Indeed, programming in Basic itself can
produce some excellent results; however such techniques are
virtually outmoded by virtue of the wealth of high resolution
and colour, bit mapped software available for Commodore
users a  prop, plane will get you there, hut a jet will do it a
great deal faster! So what is available in the 'fast-mode'
option?
There is a clear division between graphics software; in
one group we have programs using keyboard, joystick, light
pens, paddles, graph-pads o r mouse fo r direct screen
manipulation. The other group relies mainly on the ability to
apply specialised commands, via programming techniques,
to produce similar results. Each has its own advantages
according to the individual. Indeed, Commodore users have
a vvealth of material on which to draw, and these two groups
should -be considered separately.

Firstiv Screen Controlled Graphics. In 1983, Audio Light
produced Koala Painter and set everything in motion. This
program is controlled by joystick or paddles. The now
familar features o f drawing, circling, boxing, blocking,
ﬁlling and pattern ﬁlling etc. are all available, including a
good mirror effect which produces a version of whatever
option you are using in quadruple. The zoom function is
excellent, screen swapping is possible and a copy option is
likewise there. Full use is made o f the 16 Commodore
colours for paper, ink, ﬁlling and pattern ﬁlling. All graphics
may be saved and reloaded from disk. The drawbacks to this
software are: no control of cursor speed; no text to screen:
and no printer output. The screen is saved in 40 blocks,
however, and it is thus possible to transfer your picture to
another suitale graphics program by opening the ﬁle and

renaming as required. The graphics produced by Koala
Painter are of a high standard of resolution. It should be
mentioned that a Koala Pad is available at considerable
expense.
Doodle
Next comes Doodle. This, of course, is the program 'par
excellence' of 1984. Again, this is joystick and keyboard
controlled, but here we have a system incorporating cursor
control with speed settings ranging from very slow to very
fast, allowing for extreme precision.
The Main Menu in Doodle has nine displays (sketch,
lines, boxes, circles, zoom, copy, stamp, letter, disk and
print). These are selected via the function keys and the
keyboard. On choosing any one of these options, a second
screen is displayed which gives a detailed account of how to
handle the option chosen. It is impossible to enumerate all
the options within these sub-menus — there are more than
enough to  satisfy the most demanding artist (mirror
imaging, photo-negative creation, store in memory, recall
etc.). An OP-ART ﬁll gives useful parallel lines. Rotate this
ﬁll i f you wish and you could well use Doodle for
architectural planning, electronic circuitry and the like.
Relative to this there is a GRID available which can pinpoint
your drawings accurately.
The letter Mode is well worth considering. While there
are no Fonts available, normal lettering may be expanded
horizontally or vertically, reversed or rotated in 90 degree
steps through the full 360 degrees. Printer output is available
in either small or large format.
Doodle is a worthy program. It cannot be grasped in 10
minutes. Work through it however and you have a powerful
tool — the graphics screen and instruction screens are
readily interchangeable. All screens may be saved to disk
and reloaded.
Drawing Board
Now what else is worthy of mention? Plenty! Firstly a 3D
Graphic's Drawing Board (Glentop Publishers Ltd) opened a
new concept of graphics entirely. This program is keyboard
or joystick controlled and allows three dimensional
perspective images to  be created rapidly with inbuilt
C64 G R A P H I C S
Picasso
As yet, no software has been discussed which uses a light pen
— so on to this. To get the maximum stability from any light
pen, your TV screen or monitor should be cleaned with an
anti-static ﬂuid and brightness control altered to suit the
pen. So what is there in the way of supportive merchandise?
Picasso's Revenge (Progressive Peripherals & Software)
is a reasonable graphics including light pen. While the
operative graphics are fairly standard there is a texture
designing feature, a mirror option, where drawings are
mirrored in the horizontal or vertical plane, a focus option
for the light pen to control drawing speed and a useful
Printout facility mihich allows you to save pictures from
'most other C64 graphics programs'.
These may then be edited with PR, providing your
programs are in multi-colour bit map code. Doodle graphics
may be saved, but not amended, as Doodle operates in a
high-resolution mode. Koala is very acceptable among
others. There is also a small Basic Program listed to enabe
you to load and view your cretions in Basic. The light pen
functions well.
Overall, this software is essentially for the quick draw
cartoonist and could be invaluable for pattern designers
using the mirror code.
automatic control. Initially a panel of 25 options appears on
screen (manual deﬁnitely required). There is no difﬁculty in
handling any o f the options, but here we have a totally
different concept in graphics creation.
Essentially you are handling lines, rectangles, pyramids,
prisms, cylinders, cubes etc. Which can all be stretched in
part of whole, squeezed, moved, scaled to order, combined,
saved in sub-parts and added to other drawings — all of
which is automated to your commands and saved to disk.
Exact drawing is possible using visible co-ordinates, the
horizontal may be reset for technical drawing and scale
drawing is a major feature combined with twisting and
turning on the x and Y axes should you wish. Lines may be
erased or 'hidden'.
While there are no ﬁll facilities, you have the option of
saving to Koala and continuing from there. Printer output is
is to the MPS801/803 in normal or enlarged format. This
program is readily grasped — the computer does the work!

Nu: fell? Paddle,

Blazing Paddles
Blazing Paddles has been lurking around the USA for three
years and, up until now, has been available, as a straight
import, at a price which is in excess of the value of the
program. Happily, Date! Electronics is marketing this disk
at a most reasonable price indeed. Should you wish a light
pen. DATEI, will also provide their own at extra cost.
This is a popular program, which is operative with touch
tablet, paddles, joystick, paddles and light pen. Again the
standard features are all there, but the Main Menu displayed
around the screen is very fast in operation. Screen colour is
also readily changed with the function keys — very useful for
light pen users.
The colour drawing selections are in various modes and
three colours may be operated at any one time; pattern ﬁlling
is available. The cut and paste options are really good, Text
to screen has Fonts available inclusive of standard.
A feature of considerable appeal is the Inbuilt' graphics
(animals, transport, shapes, face parts etc.) which may be
selected, ﬂipped, rotated in 90 degree steps, transferred to
the screen pasted around and colour ﬁlled. This is really
good for the younger set.
Printer output is, of course, available (good selection).
The light pen is good, but my Neos mouse is uncontrollable
in BP.
Cadpak
Cadpak (Abacus Software) is available for the C64 and the
128, the latter costing somewhat more than the former. This
software is  essentially for  the designer and has many
multiple functions available, Operational procedures are
controlled via the keyboard or by light pen, again at extra
cost.
This is an extremely ﬂexible program with a Main Menu
of 22 functions. Each of these Menus has a sub-menu. Apart
from the more standard features of the graphics package,
there are other features available: two screen operation,
object, Font, object designing and screen swapping to
mention but a few, This is not a package for the budding
artist, but is intended primarily for design and planning
work as the name implies. Scaling, dimension features and
text to screen are there or course and printer output (eight
printer types) are accurate.
Art Studio
Now t o  a very versatile, easily handled, mutiloptional,
inexpensive program produced by  Rainbird. I  refer, o f
course, to Tire Art Studio. The input devices are keyboard,
joystick, or  a mouse and a Koala Pad, The Main Menu
appears at the top of the screen and, from this the sub menus
of the option you have chosen are then 'pulled down'.
Believe rue, there are plenty of options here to keep you
happy in view of the fact that there are 24 Main Menus alone
(all may be made visible by moving the screen up and down),
The Attribute section covers colour handling, and inks
may be set t o transparent mode allowing nothing to be
drawn over it. The Painting option offers 16 pens, eight
spray cans for texturing and eight different brushes. One of
the brushes is blank, allowing you to colour in areas of the
screen assuming y ou have sketched a black and white
drawing.
C64 G R A P H I C S
The Window Option is full of possibilities — cutting and
pasting of course, plus increasing or decreasing the size of
the window, plus rotational and ﬂipping facilities.
Filling may in solid mode or in 32 predeﬁned patterns.
These may be amended to suit your own ideas using the Edit
Texture option.
Zooming is there (Magnify), plus a grid control. Text to
screen may be horizontal or vertical, in double or treble
height/width. Then, again there is a Font editor.
Print output handles ﬁve sizes. This, however is limited
to certain printers. A feature which is commendable is one
where you may print in gradations of  grey (colours are
interpreted as different shades o f  grey); furthermore the
picture may be printed sideways, left or right hand side of the
page or in the middle.
Enough here to satisfy everyone and all easily handled. It
won't cost you a fortune.
Artist 64
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
52
Artist 64 from Wigmore may be handled with joystick or
mouse.
All I can say is that this program deserves the best, you
should use the Neos mouse. Indeed your 64 is now virtually
transformed into an Amiga. The Neos mouse handles this
software w it h  consummate ease a n d  is  unbelievably
responsive. O f course, the combined software and mouse
will set you back 1:70 —so you must be really prepared to use
this program to the full.
The manual i s  n o t  a t  a l l  complicated, a n d  the
permutations and combinations of Command and Option
allow over a quarter of a million different combinations.
While I have not worked this out speciﬁcally, I am prepared
to believe Wigmor e giv ing d u e  allowance f o r  t h e
unreliability of statistics.
It is fundamentally impossible to give a full outline of
what is  available: naturally a ll standard features are
incorporated plus reserves of unbelievable ingenuity, most
of which are found in the SPFX Menu, Also included is an
exceptionally powerful text option.
All commands are Menu driven and handled with
extreme speed and reliability. Your graphics may be copied
to any area of the screen, protected, cycled through various
colours, magniﬁed, drawn from a ﬁxed locus with any type
of brush you care to design in solid or pattern form, ﬁlled,
textured, ﬂipped, mirror imaged; arcs may be drawn, part of
the screen cleared, and on and on.
Interchange from Menu to screens is very smooth and
this is a highly professional tool.
At this point, you must consider whether you area quick
sketcher, a designer or a person seeking an outlet for good
artistry on the Commodore. All options are open to you, like
any form of painting, computer art demands patience and
application.
Simon's Basic
Graphics with Structured Programming is another option
for you to consider. Here requisite commands have to be
programmed in the standard line format using 'shorthand'
commands. This allows for program creation as well as high
speed drawing techniques.

Simon's Basic is well known as the forerunner in this
ﬁeld. Fundamentally, the graphics are handled by the draw
command s, boxing, blocking, circling etc., while sprites are
handled readily and 'music' is available. Naturally there is a
great deal in this program apart from the graphics — screen
scrolling, line renumbering, merging etc. Many people
became rather frustrated with their inability to get to grips
with many of the commands, a fact which David Simons
realised in his foreword to a book written by Jane G. Reh
(Commodore's Handbook of Simon's Basic; Prentice-Hall
1985). For those of you who wish to make full use of this
program, reference to this book would be of value.
Ultrabasic 64
In the same year Ultrabasic-64 was marketed by Abacus
Software. This is an excellent program which handles the
programming o f  graphics in a  readily understandable
form.Quite apart from that, TURTLE graphics have been
incorporated which work at very high speed (unlike LOGO).
Sprites may be designed on screen or inserted as data
statements, and with a little knowledge of screen handling,
may be directed around the screen with great facility, rotated
etc. Music is best conﬁned to 'sounds' with this program.
Text to screen is available in four modes.
All functions are completely interlinked with Basic so
you have complete control with respect to programming.
Printer output is available in one size and graphics may be
saved to disk and recalled as required.
s,
C64 G R A P H I C S
Video basic
Videobasic-64, a greatly extended form of the above, became
available in 1984 but has only recently appeared on the UK
market. Roy Wainright, who programmed Ultrabasic has
really extended himself (as in Cadpak-64 and Cadpak-
128). As well as the functions listed above, region copying of
graphics is possible. Here a drawing on one part of the screen
may be copied to any other part. Two screen handling is also
available, which is well detailed in the manual. These two
additions give you a very powerful tool.
Music may now be extended to single voice tunes —
select the parameters you wish for waveform, attack, sustain
etc. Filling and blocking have been extended to pattern
mode, while circles may be deﬁned on the x and y axes to give
elliptical shapes o f  any form. Again all this is fully
compatible with Basic. Output is to eight printer types in
small or large format.
A Royalty Free Makedisk is incorporated allowing free
marketing of any programs produced with Videobasic.
As a postscript, remember that Printmaster, and Print
Shop allow you to  design your own graphics: Print
Shop Companion also lets you collect a fragment from
Doodle to use in Print Shop itself. Remember that this is only
a two block section — not a lot. There is, of course, also
Newsroom.
So much is there. No Commodore owner need ever
complain of a lack of graphics software!

design your own characters with ease
and save them on disk or tape for later
use within y o u r  o w n  programs.
Should y o u  re q u i re  m o r e
information on user deﬁned characters
then you should take a look at the
'Mastering the C I6 ' article i n  the
November 1985 issue o f  Your
Conunodore or have a look at the C16
Programmers Reference Guide which
is available from ANCO software.
Entering the Program
The program is printed as a memory
dump that should be entered using the
computers monitor. To do this start
the monitor up by typing MONITOR
and then pressing return. In order to
start entering the program type:
M 1070 and press RETURN
now overtype the numbers and letters
of the program with those printed in
the magazine, remember t o  press
RETURN at the end of each line. Since
the C16 only has a small amount of
memory we have saved space by not
printing a  Basic Loader fo r  this
program. You must therefore check
every line extremely carefully as a
single mistake w i l l  prevent th e
program from working.
Before Y o u attempt to RUN the
program you must make sure that you
SAVE it just in case you have made a
mistake and end u p  loosing the
program in memory.
To SAVE the program enter the
following line:
S "CHAPE"ED, DEV 1070, 1823
where dev is 01 for tape use and 08 for
disk use.
To Use the Program
Enter t h e  m o n i to r  b y  typ i n g
MONITOR
Cl o  &  P l u s / 4  111
Since the C16 and Plus/4 computers do not have any sprite
graphics, the ability to  be able to  design your own
characters is extremely important.
Type L
is as above.
When the program has loaded
type:
I  D000 D7FF 3000
now run the program with G 1215.
The program is made so more parts
can be added later, so keep an eye out
for improvements.
Just in case you wish to add some
extras yourself, I  will list the main
points you'll need.

Commodore U K ' S  M D ,  Chris
Kaday s aid: " C ommodor e hav e
developed another product which will
dictate the shape of the market The
Amiga 500 really does represent the
ultimate low cost computer. Fantastic
games, s uperb mus ic  capabilities,
video capabilities are all available to
the highest possible standard. That
would be enough to ensure that the
Amiga A500 is a success, but when
combined w i t h  multi-tasking, t h e
beneﬁts f o r  h o m e  pr oduc tiv ity
applications are outstanding.
"For the ﬁrst time, leading edge
16/32 bit technology is available in the
home in the same time scale as it is
being released in the industry. A very
exciting oppor tunity  f o r  any one
interested in a computer."
Speciﬁcations
The Amiga A500 offers the Amiga
stanard Motorola 68000 plus 3 chip
word processor system w it h 5 I 2 K
RAM which is internally expandable
to IMb. It comes with a mouse as a
WIMP system. The integral keyboard
is a high quality business layout. One
in-built 880K 3.5inch ﬂoppy drive is
included with the opportunity to add
MO additional drives.
There ar e P C  compatible and
parallel ports arid Amiga systembus
expansion. A  modulator and 0,5Mb
RAM boar d w it h  b u ilt  i n  c loc k
calendar are available options.
Release of the A500 will be in June
at the Commodore Show. Price is E499
plus V A T  and distribution w ill be
through major  r etail outlets  a n d
independent computer stores.
And to Business
The A2000 is claimed by Commodore
to possess unrivalled processing power
and ﬂexibility across the whole range
of business computer applications.
For the ﬁrst time the Intel and
Motorola processing environments
have been brought together in one
machine, giving the user the beneﬁt of
running MS-DOS business software
with t h e  fas t, powerful graphics-
orientated 68000 environment in true
multi-tasking mode.
Chris Kaday  commented: " T he
reaction from the corporate market
has been extremely encouraging as
they have a growing need to add power
A M I G A  N E W S
A 2000
and ﬂexibility to desk top computing
whilst retaining existing MS- DO S
standards, The A2000 will be aimed at
the existing markets o n  CadCam,
process c ontr ol, business presen-
tations, communications and terminal
emulation, whilst also establishing the
new mark ets  o f  des k  t o p  a n d
interactive v ideo w hic h represent
massive opportunities f o r  Comm-
odore as we are right at the start."
Speciﬁcations
The A2000 is based on the proven
Motorola 68000 running at 7.14MHz
supported b y  three co-processors,
with I MB of RAM which is internally
expandable up to 9Mb. As standard,
there are eight interfaces including
serial a n d  parallel por ts  a n d  a n
interface for  the detachable 94 key
business k ey board. A  mous e i s

industry, from weddings to Channel

sales o f  the P A L  Genlock system.

overlayed on t o  video frames. Aegis
Animator, already used in the Disney
School of Animation in Hollywood for
teaching animation technique, takes
the process a step further and makes
the Amiga the prime source of footage!
A recent Horizon programme on

users. These included not only  the
standard packages but revolutionary
combinations of Amiga with video and
music.
On show were Analyse, claimed to
be the fastest recalculating spreadsheet
available, t h e  Sc r ibble I I  w o r d
processor and the Organise database.
A 512K R AM pack, Akgra, can be
added to the Amiga (it plugs on to the
expansion bus) to allow the Scribble,

Analyse incorporates the ability to
quality-graph all data entered on a pie,
bar, x-y or 3D chart, using up to eight
colours. Scribble a llo w s  the writer to
edit four  documents on the Amiga
screen at once and to move between all
four. Organise is the complementary
database with easy form creation on
screen, relational operation and data
analysis.
Although the quality is high the
Amiga cannot match the range o f
business software available f or  the
ubiquitous P C .  Therefore regular
business users may  prefer PC  X I
compatibility in the form of Sidecar.
The A m i g a / P C  X T  combination
works out at I:1,795 when bought from
scratch. If you buysidecar separately it
will cost i'699, making it .000 more
expensive to add-on Sidecar for those
already owning an Amiga 1000 system.

Pro Video Fonts 'n' Frames
JDK Images has produced the Pro
Video CGI character generator for the
Amiga. The developer is Jeff Karline, a
professional w i th  many years o f
experience i n  th e  cable television
industry.
The three very attractive character
sets are available in three sizes in
NYSC interlace and MO horizontal
picture resolution. Eight colours can
be used per page (from the full 4096
colours). Th e re  a r e  selectable
shadows, outlining, backgrounds,
grids, underlining and ﬂash. One
hundred pages of text can be managed
entirely in memory.
For the really professional touch,
page transitions include rolls, wipes,
reveals, slides, pulls, bang, fade and
checkerboard with selectable speed
and dwell. Alternative font sets are
available on separate disks.
Desktop Video
Independent ﬁl m makers Spafax
Television and Triangle Television
demonstarted a t  t h e  Wh i ch ?
Computer Show both the use of the
Amiga as a point of purchase video
and, in association with interactive
video, as a training device. Spafax
combined Amiga, Phillips Laser-
vision, touchscreen facility and
specially developed software.
Triangle use th e  Amiga f o r
superimposing graphics, titles, bar
charts and pie charts on to video tape,
mixing with frames from other sources
such as video camera or laser disk.
Triangle TV 's  Peter Barrett has
expressed his enthusiasm about the
professional results obtainable from
the Amiga/Genlock system.
Amiga in Advertising
The Oslo branch o f Ted Bates, the
well-known television advertising
agency, has opted for Amigas in its
creative department. P e r  Berg,
managing director, says "I see great
possibilities for quicker development
of ideas, and the prospect of speeding
up decision making, We will be able to
show the client combination and
alternatives of form and colour, on the
spot. The old dream o f having the
client as a member of the team will
come closer than ever before,"
Advertising concepts and designs will
NE WS
be developed o n  the Amiga and
trialled before commiting them to the
ﬁnal production stages.
Sidecar i s a  pretty hefty box
containing the co-processor, 256K
memory a n d  5.25" d i sk  drive.
Standard IBM expansion slots are also
contained within, Th e  software
running o n  th e  co-processor i s
displayed in a window on the Amiga's
monitor and it is perfectly possible to
have both Amiga and sidecar processes
running side b y side. The Sidecar
complements the Amiga beautifully.
The creative computer now has a
serious side for those whose creativity
is their business. It remains to be seen
what PC compatible software will run
with sidecar, there is certainly plenty of
powerful, and now relatively cheap,
business software available. We will
report back on our ﬁndings in Your
Amiga later in the year.
Commodore certainly expect to
make the Amiga a success in business
markets. They announced that they
had sold 150,000 Amigas worldwide in
'year one'. Chris Kaday, Comm-
odore's Managing Director in the UK
said "We entered 1987 with the Amiga
selling across more applications areas
than we believed possible, With more
than 300 software packages now
available for the Amiga, we have had a
hard task choosing those to launch on
our stand at the Which? Computer
Show".

collection of picture sets. It is possible
to create cyan/magenta/yellow
separation and edit each exposure for
individual colour enhancement.
PCB Design
The E499 PCLO i s a  professional
printed circuit design package for the
Amiga which produces ﬁnished PCB
artwork on a Houston Instruments or
similar plotter. PCLO utilises libraries
of designs which can be loaded and
manipulated on both sides of a PCB. A
high-speed routing alogorithm results
in a real circuit trace that follows all
the design rules, avoids any other
subjects and follows the shortest path.
Amiga Reference Manuals
Addison Wesley publishes the ofﬁcial
Amiga Reference Manuals produced in
conjunction with Commodore and
written b y  me mb e rs o f  t h e
Commodore Amiga team. There are
four manuals on hardware, Intuition,
ROM Kernal, Libraries and Devices
and ROM Kernel, Exec.
A fairly high level of knowledge is
assumed by the manuals but they are
fascinating and very lucid descriptions
of the Amiga system. The hardware
manual is an overview of the graphics
and audio hardware and the peripheral
controllers. There are descriptions of
the dedicated Copper (graphics
coprocessor) and blitter chips. The
depth of these manuals is shown by the
eight appendices giving the entire
register set and the uses of individual
bits.
The Intuition guide is essential
reading for the software writer who
wishes to imbue his programs with the
unique 'feel' of the Amiga, something
which comes through the correct use of
the Intuition user interface. There are
full guidelines as well as a complete
listing of the components of Intuition,
speciﬁcations of data structures and
function calls.
The ROM Kernel manuals deal in
separate volumes with libraries and
devices and Exec. The former contains
vital insights into how to implement
features such a s  graphics a n d
animation, text fonts, audio and
speech. Exec. is pulled apart with all
the routines which support multi-
processing listed out and described.
These manuals are excellently
presented with clear layouts and text
styles. Diagrams a n d  example

Business Updates
Following our look at Superbase in the
last issue of Your Amiga I have been
asked to point o u t  that Superbase
external ﬁles are ﬁles held for 'review
purposes' and ar e link ed t o  a  co-
incident database index. I don't think
we made it clear enough that this is not
an example of Superbase's ability to
extablish connections (relationships)
with any ﬁle or combination of ﬁles
within the database.
The news of Ariadne's SCSI/hard
drive interface f o r  1:299 and their
complete 20Mb hard disk system for
1:799 leads me to think that .S'uperbase
operating with hard disk could be very
powerful core to the Amiga business
system.
Logistix is now selling for E149 on
the A m ig a .  G r a f o x  h a s  b e e n
encouraged by early sales to make the
price drop. The PC version has also
enjoyed a similar drop to E99. Is the
Amiga version better by 1:50?
Metacomco Macros
The B r is t o l b a s e d  w r it e r s  o f
AmigaDOS, have announced a new
68000 Macro Assembler. Metacomco
wrote the original Amiga Assembler,

Gimpel Software has introduced
Amiga-Lint, a  b u g  ﬁnder  f o r  C

C programs, much more so than a
compiler a n d  i t  c a n  h e lp  mak e
programs more efﬁcient by identifying
redundancy. Price S9K00.
Micro API. Ltd has launched the
APL 68000 for the Amiga emulating
IBM's V5APL. There's full interface to
all the Amiga's graphics facilities and
there are built-in VT100 APL/ASC
terminal emulations. T he language
runs in its own windows and debugs in
another. A PL 68000 is priced at E200.
High Level Ventures
Level 9 compilations Silicon Dreams

available on the Rainbird label. A t
1:19.95 they  look  very good value
beside some of the imports. Each pack
contains three full scale adventures on
disk and a novella.
In the latest, Silicon Dreams, you
play the part o f  Kim Kimberely in
Snoivball, Return t o  Eden and The
Worm in Paradise. The trilogy boasts
over 600 illustrations ( not t o  the
highest Amiga standards but not bad),
over 13 million locations (still testing
this claim), 1800 word vocabulary,
new inter pr eter , multi- c ommand
sentences and multitasking (you can
play two at once on a 5I2K Amiga).
Low, Price Gaines
It had to happen. This spring should
see the ﬁrst release of budget software
for the Amiga.
The software house behind the
games is Anco arid the ﬁrst two to be
released will be entitled Space Battle
and Demolition. Both will cost E14.95.

T
and power attributed t o the Amiga
have not deterred software designers
from coming up with additional. and
alternativ e ' u s e r  in t e r f a c e s ' .
Metacomco's Shell is  an enhanced
version of the CLI, the command line
interface which takes commands from
the keyboard and interprets them into
actions taken b y  the Amiga Dis k
Operating System.
Shell Shock
Metacomco's people are 'insiders' as
far as the Amiga is concerned since
they s upplied Commodor e w i t h
AmigaDOS, the multiprocessing disk
operating system whic h lies at  the
heart of the computer. Their products
therefore can be expected to engage
comfortably and correctly with the
resident Amiga software.
This is very much the case with
Metacomco's t  49.95 S h e l l  is
installed on the Workbench disk, in
the SYSTEM drawer and its attractive
icon (put your ear to it and you can
almost hear the sea!) will pop up next
to the CLI when the SYSTEM drawer
is double clicked. Shell works with
Workbench V1.1 and V1.2. A patch is
provided for V1.1 which is transferred
automatically when Shell is copied via
the RAM disk.
When activated. the Shell Opens
TASK I and draws a window in which
to work. Shell is  a  new work ing
environment, a version of CLI which

such as copying ﬁles, sending tiles to

etc.) and cataloguing a disk, The full
set of new features is shown in the 'help
screen'.
Command Line Contrast
Compared to many 'lesser' systems,
the standard Amiga C L I  insists on
YOUR AMIGA may 1987
9
such sophisticated actions as retyping
every command line and deleting to
correct back along a command line
(cursor keys), deletion and insertion of
characters. Pressing RETURN at any
time activates the command, you don't
have to have the cursor at the end of
the line,

As you enter a command, _Shell not
only executes i t .  i t  als o helpfully
'remembers' the commands typed in.
This is the HISTORY feature. You can
tell i t  h o w  many  commands t o
remember but it  starts with 10. The
archived commands ar e held in  a
numbered list. You can move up and
down the list with the up and down
cursor keys or retrieve a command line
from the list for  editing with these
three keystrokes: n u m b e r  in list and
ESCAPE.' If you just want to activate
the number ed c o mma n d ,  thes e
keystrokes will do: '!, number in list
and R E T U R N ' .  • ! !  R E T U R N '
activates the last command typed.
Let's jus t give a  br ief example.
Suppose y ou execute the following
sequence of commands:
copy des k top/banner s /x tr a t o
df I :desktop/newspaper
key 6 copy* to PRT:
then type 'history'. The following will
be printed on screen:
I c o p y  desktop/banners/xtra t o
df :desktop/newspaper
2 key 6 copy * to PRT:
Now ty pe ! I  a n d  R ET U R N and
command I is executed again. Typing
!2 a n d  ESC APE w i l l  redis play
command 2 for editing. Which brings
us to function key deﬁnition.
At Your Convenience
Shell lets you deﬁne the function keys
with the KEY command. Typing KEY
along gives you a display of the current
deﬁnitions. A deﬁnition may contain
the '  A M' c o mb in a t io n ( w h ic h
represents a press o f  the RETURN
key) at the end of a line. Thus a key
deﬁnition s uc h a s  'k ey  3  assem
window.asm - o  window. 0  A  m '
enables the sequence to be executed
with a single key press.
A f u r t h e r  in v a lu a b le  n e w
command i s  R ESID EN T , w hic h
transfers Amiga DOS commands such
as C O PY o r  D 1 R  in t o  memory.
Normally such a  command is  read
from disk, executed and discarded.
Having just a few commands resident
can save a lot o f  disk swapping and
makes a  single disk system almost
usable! One DOS command which is
always resident in Shell is CD.
PUSH a n d  P O P  a r e  n e w
REVIE W
commands w h i c h  m a k e  u s i n g
directories easier. An A migaDOS disk
can hold up to 9000,000 bytes of data
and often multiple directories ar e
setup to keep ﬁles in a managaeable
form. Thus two directories on a disk
can end up some distance from each
other in the directory 'tree'. Using
PUSH a n d  PO P y ou c an switch
between t w o  directories w it h o u t
having t o  t y p e  t h e  c o m p le t e
pathnames. PUSH moves you into the
speciﬁed directory and remembers
whence y o u  came. Issuing a  POP
command tak es y ou bac k  t o  t he
remembered directory b u t  without
recalling where it's come from. Issuing
PUSH again on its own returns to the
r emember d d i r e c t o r y ,  a g a i n
remembering its start point.
Paths, Aliases and Variables
For the programmer, Shell adds a
number of useful features to the CLI.
The PAT H  command redeﬁnes the
sequence of directories in which the
system look s  f o r  a  command ﬁle.
Normally it will look in the current
directory and then the C (command)
directory. So i f  you have a utilities
directory you can add it to the search
path. This means that you can just type
the utility name and not worry about
the rest of the pathname.
An alias is an alternative name for
any string you care to give it to. The
simply syntax is ALIAS < aliasname >
< actual name -
c compilation. It is a nickname or short
form. I f  you can't remember what
allocations you've made then typing
ALIAS on its own reminds you.
Aliases can only be used as the ﬁrst
thing on a command line and cannot
contain spaces o r  tabs  i n  t h e ir
deﬁnitions. Variables are much more
ﬂexible. Any part of a command line
may be assigned to a variable with the
command SET. Let's give an example:
alias c copy
set t dﬂ:textﬁles/letters
set dfLascilliles
will allow you to use the shortened
command line
c $t $a
to perform
copy dﬂ:textﬁles/letters dﬂ:asciiﬁles
YOUR AMIGA may 1987
10
The '$' character points the Shell in the
direction o f  a variable. I f  you now
type:
set b c St Sa
then b is deﬁned in terms of the other
variables and now represents the entire
line. Just type Sb to execute. Individual
variables can be redeﬁned at any stage.
For instance:
set a df0:ascliﬁles
would now redeﬁne the a element in b.
b now equals:
copy dﬂ:textﬁles/letters df0:ascliﬁles
The command EQU does the same as
SET but deﬁnes a variable in terms o
another using that variable's current
deﬁnition. Any subsequent change to
that variable will not change that set by
EQU.
Shell Summed Up
The need f o r  a  brand new editor
should n o t  b e  underestimated.
Coming to the CLI of the Amiga from
any modern eight bit computer can be
a frustrating business -no wonder that
it's initially 'hidden' from the user. The
main limitation is the user's inability to
edit or copy commands already typed
in. This leads to repeat typing, highly
undesirable when large pathnames are
involved. T her e a r e  limited and
inﬂexible ways to cut down the length
of what y ou have t o  type but the
abbreviations circumvent the system's
positive ability  t o  maintain long
meaninful ﬁlenames . S h e l l  can
promptly snap you out of  this non
typist's nightmare.
The 149.95 price tag is justiﬁed b
the overall excellence of the product.
The manual is over 100 pages of clearl
written text with plenty of examples.
The lar ge selection o n  C I A  (1.2)
commands is  added value for  those
without a CLI reference work. There is
a 'quick reference' appendix on the
Shell-only commands and an index.
The new command editor lets yo
freely enter  a  c ommand a n d  its
parameters and combines with the
other extended features to make Shell
easy to use, an important contribution
for the general Amiga user. For the
software developer. S h e ll means
higher productivity 'and the keyboard.
Of these increases in ease of' use and
productivity y ou can he sure, wi

Deluxe Problem
Transformations
Amiga Agony
Until recently, I  have been using my
Amiga w i t h  version L I  o f  both
Kickstart and Workbench, In America
however, I purchased a copy of a new
art program called Deluxe Paint 11,
only to return home and ﬁnd that it
would not work  correctly with my
version o f  Kickstart. Help! I  have
spoken t o my  dealer who says it is
because the program is American, is
this right?
David Sands, London.
No. The reason Deluxe Paint II will not
work is because it was designed to use
the newest, version 1.2 of Kickstart. As
all software will i n  the future be
designed to use this system. it would be
advisable for you to go to your dealer
and TELL him to get your disks updated
to the new versions of both Kicks tart
and Workbench.
A friend of mine recently sold me his
Amiga which he imported personally
from America in early 1986. Although
it works perfectly, I still have to use a
transformer to run the machine on
240v. As  yet I  have not found any
software that will refuse to run on my
machine, and last week I  was sent
copies o f  1 . 2  Wor k benc h a n d
Kickstart, which work perfectly. My
question is two-fold.
Firstly, can I upgrade my computer
to British PAL standards, so that I can
then us e a  Gen-lock system? An d
secondly, w h a t  a r e  t h e  m a i n
differences between versions 1.1 and
1.2 of Kickstart and Workbench?
P. Taylor, Camberley
To start with, yes you can upgrade your

hardware or software, then write in to this page and our
teams of experts will straighten you out.
machine, although it will be necessary to
ask your local dealer to get the chips
and, unless you feel very conﬁdent, top
them too. Once the chips and power
supply have been changed. you will have
a completely compatible UK Amiga,
As O r  the differences between
versions 1,1 anti 1.2 they are basically
chalk and cheese. 1.2 Kickstart no
longer lets the Amiga crash a t the
slightest provocation, and is essential
for using on a PAL system. 1.2 also
allows the Amiga to  auto-conﬁgure
itself for extra RAM, allowing up to
eight megabytes at once. For people
used t o  1.1 th e  most noticeable
difference will be in the speed and
quietness of the disk drives, which are
now a quite fast and much less noisy.
There are also differences in the
Workbench software provided with the
machine. The Preference is much more
complete, with an extended list o f
compatible printers, and there are a
couple of other small additions.
Disk Size?
L E T T E R S
Unlike mos t o f  t he people w h o
purchase Amigas, I  use mine as a
business machine (although I  do o f
course enjoy  the other facilities i t
provides). When I bought the machine
I was told that, when I wanted to, I
could attach a 5.25" disk drive, and
convert my  IBM PC ﬁles to Amiga
format.
Recently I have been working more
from home and would like this facility,
do I need software as well as the drive?
M. Street, Stevenage.
There are two completely different
solutions to your problem, and they both
achieve a  similar end; allowing you
various degrees of PC comp lability. The

.
Jo buy a piece of hardware produced by
Commodore called the Sidecar. This is a
large box that plugs into the side of the
Amiga, and comes with a built in 5.25"
drive and a 8088 processor.
Basically the Sidecar acts as a
completely stand alone M S  D OS
machine, that uses the Amiga as an
Input/output system. I n  M S  DOS
mode, the Sidecar allows the Amiga to
run almost any IBM software. although
,vou do lose the obvious advantages of
the Amiga's in o p e r a t i n g
SySteni.
The other alternative is to purchase
a standard 1090 5.25" disk drive, and
some software called Transformer. This
allows the Amiga's 68000 processor to
emulate the 8088 processor, and run a
limited amount o f  PC' software
(including certain versions of Wordstar
and Lotus 123), and to transfer data ﬁles
into Amiga format. h  really depends
how tnuch computability you need. I f
you want to bring your own software
home, the Sidecar is for you. If allyou
tt
then port in into, .for example. Logistix,
then Transformer would do the job
perfectly.
Word Pro Problems
When I  bought my  Amiga, I  also
bought a  word-processing package
from Commodore called Textcraft. At
work I  use it with an Epson FX100,
and a t  h o m e  I  u s e  a n  F X80,
unfortunately, I have found a number
of problems that spoil this otherwise
excellent piece of software.
Firstly, a n d  mos t importantly.
when I try and print any document, all
my pages are preceded by a random

then have to white out each letter.
Secondly, if  I use T e x
second disk drive, it sometimes hangs,
without warning, meaning I have to
reset m y  c omputer before I  c an
continue.
Any help you can give would be
appreciated.
D.Catlin. Inverness.
Unfortunately the printing problem is a
well known bug in version 1 of Textcraft.
To remove the random letter, you must
use the Generic setting i n  your
Preference, but unfortunately this then
means that you cannot use any special
typestyles! The hanging is also a result
of the early version of Textcraft you are
using, but it can be avoided by creating a
start of day disk, and being caretid to
erase aizy_ﬁ/es you do not need. As long
as you keep this up, you will have no
problems.
Thankfully. Commodore has
pmmised that there is a new and bag-
free version o f Tex:craft on the way,
although n o  o n e  i s  sure when.
Alternatively you could use Scribble
LE T T E R S
which, as far as I know, has none
these type of problems.
Mathematical Speed
of
As a maths tutor. I  have been very
impressed at the capabilities o f  the
Amiga as a workhorse for jobs such a
number crunching and the creation of
Fractal graphics and Mandelbrots.
My only qualm is that the 68000
processor is  a  little slow for  these
purposes, es pec ially  w h e n  t h e
programs have been written i n  a
language such as C.
Is there any way of speeding up the
processor?
Professor 13.McGrath, I lull.
To be honest, any noticeable speed
increase will cost a great deal of money,
but if you have the funds, there are three
different processors that would achieve
the desired results. A 68010 or 68020
processor, t o  replace the standard
68,000, would certainly nmake a speed
difference, making the machine between
10% and 30%, faster. If your interest is
only i n  maths, then a  68881 co-
processor, to work in tandem with the
standard 68000 would probably achieve
the most noticeable speed improvement.
Constant Kickstart
As with many other Amiga users that I
know, I am becoming more and more
tired of having to boot my Amiga with
Kickstart every time I wish to use it.
understand that now Kickstart
1.2 is totally stable, Commodore has
decided to install it  in RO M in the
newest machines, the A500 and A2500.
Is there any way I can get Kickstart on
ROM for my A1000?
P. Summers, Hackney.
Until recently, the answer to  this
question would have been no, but last
week 1 heard that a company in America
has started doing just that. Even more
exciting is that, as the company piliS
Kickstart 1.2 on to 256k ROM. the user
has 256k of extra FastRAM that can be
used for purposes such as a RAM disk.
At the lime o f press, there were no
details of price or availability, but watch
this space.

When it comes lousing your Amiga at home to create printed
stationery. greeting cards, posters or labels then there are two
very evenly matched contenders: Primmaster Plus and Deluxe
Prim are the two currently available software packages. The
Former is black and white only. the latter colour.
This fundamental difference may take your selection for
vou because if you don't have a colour printer then pure black
and white printouts are more effective than grey shades. Of
course, in Deluxe Paint you can restrict yourself to just black
and white, or force black and white printouts via Preferences.
If you have a colour printer then make sure that you take full
advantage with the 16 colours (of 4096) of Deluxe Print. It is
possible to come up with the most attractive ﬁnished product.
Prinnitavier Plus offers: Sign. Stationery. Greeting Card.
Banner. Calendar.
Deluxe Print offers: Sign, Banner, Letterhead, Calendar,
Greeting card. 4-tile sign.
Deluxe Print is much more efﬁcient in the creation
department. displaying both artwork and functions on •
sereen. Clip art is loaded from disk and can be sized an
moved around the chosen paper size.
Prinunaster takes the user through a sequence of ha
menus. The artwork is not present on screen until the lina
preview stage, not an ideal situation but manageabl
Primmaster offers only restricted placement of graphics and
text, Deluxe Prim is much more ﬂexible in this respect with
'moving' and copying around the artwork, be it label or poster
sized. Primmaster has the greater range of 'graphics' - sma
pictures sometimes called 'clip art' which form the equivale
of a designer's artbook.
The subject matter covered ranges from romance- heart

It is claimed that Deluxe Palm achieved 50(.1-. penetration of
Nmiga users and. if true, that would certainly be deserved.
kers of all levels of artistic ability have enjoyed the easy to
ie hut powerful features.
And now. Deluxe Paint II is launched. There's no word of
an upgrade policy which seems a shame, especially at the
asking price.
The professional user will probably have to have it. For
he home user it's a bit steep but nevertheless, if graphics is
our interest, justiﬁes the whole system, computer and
soft ware.
Certainly from what we've now seen Deluxe Palm II is
unrivalled. More than 50 new features have been added. It is
claimed to be 20'4. faster. Its creator, Dan Silva. believes the
Ilashiest new feature is perspective mapping and perspective
till. He says Dpa int 2 actually let you move a brush around in
three dimensions and construct three dimensional space grids
based on a brush painted in tow dimensions.We've also added
the ability to ﬁll inﬁnite surfaces with a tile pattern of a brush
seen in perspective. Another new feature, Anit-alias, allows
dean up of the brushed image to eliminate jagged edges and
distortion that result when the brush is rotated or bent."
One of the nicest additions is the stencil which allows the
.inist to deﬁne areas of the screen in which the pixels are
locked, as if a transparent stencil was over them. In this way
precise areas can b e  ﬁlled. Another feature, 'ﬁxed
background', i s  analagousto ﬁxative sprayed over a
omentional painting. A ﬁxed background cannot be altered
hut it is possible to paint on top, scrape things off, pick things
up and move them to a different position with the ﬁxative
always preserving the underlying painting.
In One End
A M I G A  G R A P H I C S
Professional computer artists use a wide variety of toots to
enable them to practice their trade successfully:. Like the
conventional artist they will try anything to get the required
effect. However some input derides are preferred over others
and used much more often.
The mainstay input device of the computer artist is the
graphics tablet. It represents the nearest equivalent of putting
pen to paper or brush to canvas. Anak in Research of Toronto,
Canada - a hotbed of Amiga users - has designed such a tablet
For the Amiga. It's called Easy!.
The Easyl graphics pad connects via its own interface box
ol the Amiga's expansion bus. A 'through socket* makes the
bus available to other devices. It's a good ﬁrm lit but I
wondered why. when all the other Amiga ports have splendid
screw-secured connectors, you cannot further support devices
on the expansion bus. Not Easel's fault and I foresee no
problems with this design. A cable connects the interice to the
pad.
Any blunt instrument can be used on the 'rubbery' surface
of the pad - is in fact a special durable plastic designed for
easy maintenance. The pad is sensitive to the touch and the
software computes the position of the point of impact, a bit
like calculating a map reference. The pad is pretty sensitive
but needs a consistently ﬁrm pressure.
Experimenting with the art of software packaged with the
pad is a good way of g

In buying the Easel package, including pad and software.
you are getting a complete setup for creating pictures on your
Amiga.
The art program supplied on the Easyl disk is especially
designed to take advantage of the high co-ordinate capture
rate of the pad. some 250 co-ordinate pairs a second. You can
work in any resolution. The pull-down menus can still be
operated via the mouse if you wish, leaving the drawing to
artist and Easy!. In landscape mode the aspect ratios of the
Amiga screen and the surface of the pad are virtually identical.
In portrait mode only some of the screen is used.
Drawings from Easyl can be saved in L I T  format for
loading into other software. Indeed this is vital if you want to
print out the drawing because there is no screen printer built-
in. One-touch commands include Fill. Keep. Restore and
Clear. A  set of brushes increases the artist's options since
adjacent sampled points will always be joined up. Thinning
mode avoids clustering when drawing slowly. Direct mode
switches off the above two software control features.
If you wish to extend the power of your graphics software you
may do so trhough the use of software drivers supplied for
installation on Aegis Images and Deluxe Paint disks. The
drivers enable the soft ware to be used in conjunction with the

menu options which appear on-screen can be reproduced with
overlays (though none are provided) and the twin red and

result in very detailed reproduction. Fine editing of pictures at

Eavy/ has proved revolutionary is in the area of animation.
The skill of the anumator can be transferred directly onto the

The Easy/ package is completed by an excellent manual
packed with step by step instructions for non-specialists and
hardware details for engineers. A larger chapter is devoted to

Three colour printers are now being offered by Commodo
to try to reproduce the Amiga's beautiful screen display
hardcopy. For the commercial user there's the Mitsubishi..
thermal printer. This is being offerd to the reprogra phic trat
as part of an Amiga workstation and need not worry the hon
user.
The Xerox 4020 is priced for the business tiser at t: 1.19
It's a colour ink jet and the results are remarkably goot
capturing most of the subtlety of colours possible on th
Amiga screen. You won't be disappointed in its performant
if you are serious about reproducing graphics on paper.
Running costs should be manageable with a single color'

Amiga Basic:
an Overview
he Basic supplied with the Amiga
was written b y  Microsoft and is  a
variant of the standard Basic found on
many eight bit and l o  bit machines.
The Basic carries all of the features of
standard Microsoft Basic b u t  has
enhancements t o  make use o f  the
Amiga's extra facilities. Unfortunately
rim all of these are accessible through
Basic. One o f  the major disappoint-
ments i n  this  a l
commands. more about this later.
Most users that buy an Amiga will
be familiar with Basic from a previous
computer. Even though the dialect
may be different, there will be many
similarities where there is only a need
to learn the new syntax.
The second advantage is that Basic
is supplied w it h  t he Amiga. I t  is
therefore very accessible at no extra
cost, and should you come up with a
chart topping blockbuster you know
that your prospective buyers will be
able t o  run y our program with no
problems.
Another advantage i s  speed.
Ideally, for  programs t o  execute at
speeds required for complex graphics
etc., C or an assembler are the obvious
choices. But remember, most users will
be used to seeing Basic on eight bit
machines and believe me Basic on the
Amiga is another beast altogether. and
if used properly can equal or beat eight
bitters running machine code!
Amiga Basic also has some fairly
dvanced functions. A n  example o f
his is  the C A L L  command which
lbws y ou t o  c all machine code
cituines written in assembler language
A M I G A  B A S I C
(letting to grips with a new Basic can be a daunting
prospect. Here we try and help you on your way.
By L.K. Gibson
or C. This allows you to develop at a
nice pace starting off with just Basic.
The C ALL command also allows
you to access some of the commands in
the system Libraries - e.g. the graphics
library -  which are a deﬁnite require-
ment for any serious programming.
We all know by now that every
dialect o f  Basic supports various
standard Basic commands such as
FOR. NEXT. PRINT etc. It is point-
less to spend any more time on these
than simply t o  say that they exist
within Amiga Basic, Wh a t  I  w ill
discuss are the commands that are
slightly more peculiar to Amiga Basic
or non standard to some other dialects
of Basic, beginning with graphics.
Area ﬁll
This command is a very fast polygon
drawing routine and incorporates a ﬁll
routine. It uses a call to the graphics
library function AREAFILL and can
be used with a pattern ﬁll also,
Circle
This command allows various para-
meters dictating the circle included are
centre position, radius, colour and
aspect ratio. In version 1.1 of Work-
bench (Intuition) there is no Circle
function in the graphics library. This is
therefore implemented by Microsoft's
own developers. Note that verion 1.2
of Workbench (Intuition) does have a
circle function, but unless Amiga Basic
is released in a new version this will not
be utilised from Basic.

Get and Put
This command allows bit map info
from the screen to be picked up in an
array and be redrawn using PUT in
another area or on a different screen. It
is very fast and can produce some stun-
ning graphics i f  utilised properly.
There ar e various graphics library
functions t h a t  c ould perform this
operation and 1 don't k now which
ones were employed b u t  I  would
hazard a guess at BltBitMap which
copies sections o f  Screens bitinap
(images) from one location to another
using the systems hardware Blitter
chip.
Line
This will draw lines or boxes which can
be ﬁlled using the Move and Draw
corn ma nd s.
Objects
There are various Basic commands
that can be used for the animation of
graphic objec ts . T hes e in c lu d e
O B J E C T . A X ,  O B J E C T . A Y ,
OBJECT.CLIP, O BJ ECT.CLO SE,
OBJECT. HIT. and OBJECT.ON.
Paint
This command ﬁlls an area with colour
up to an enclosed boundary. All you
have t o  do is  specify any x / y  co-
ordinate within the shape and the
colour to be used. This command uses
a call to the graphics library function
Flood.

1
Pattern
This allows users to deﬁne the patterns
for lines, text and paint operations.
PSet and Point
I hav e grouped these commands
together because they  are comple-
mentary functions, PSET allows you
to set any point on the graphics screen
and PO INT allows you to read the
current c olour  o f  any pix el o n  a
graphics screen. The graphics library
calls for  these functions Wr itePixel
and ReadPixel respectively,
Screen and Window
These t w o  commands produce a
screen, according to various limita-
tions, which can be in  any  o f  the
standard Amiga resolutions including
Interlace (400 Pixel vertical resolu-
tion). T he user must then create a
window in which to draw. The window
can be any size within the screen limi-
tations a n d  b e  rendered w it h  o r
without system window gadgets. Note
that the standard Amiga Basic screen
and window can be used ( ( 40200
resolution) but the limitation is four
colours (two bitplanes deep), so for
any serious graphics a new screen and
window have to be created using the
above commands.
Scro
This command allows a rectangle of
almost any size to be scrolled in any
direction. The command is limited by
the fact that, as the deﬁned rectangle is
moved, it wipes out any background
data it touches and replaces it with the
background colour.
That concludes the discussion on
some o f  the more unusual graphics
commands, remember that not all of
the graphics commands are listed here.
Now 111 take a brief look at sound and
Speech commands.
Sound
This command is  the mainstay o f
sound in Amiga Basic, allowing simple
sounds to be produced on any of the
Amiga f our  sound channels. Para-
meters that c an b e  set using the
SOUND command ar e Frequency,
Dur ation, V o l u m e  a n d  V o i c e
(Channel) N umber . T h e  default
Wave
BEEP
SAY
A M I G A  B A S I C
waveform for the SOUND command
is a Sine wave but this can be altered
using the WAVE command.
When a sound is played on the Amiga,
the shape of the sound is taken from a
Waveform deﬁned in memory. This
waveform deﬁnes a  sound envelope
and controls the type of sound pro-
duced. The shape of the waveform can
be c hanged u s i n g  t h e  W A V E
command, this  gives the effect o f
altering the type of sounds produced
with t h e  SO U N D  command. T he
waveform that you deﬁne is passed
from an array, containing at least 256
numbers between —128 and 127, to the
WAVE command. this new waveform
is then valid for the voice which you
specify. Please note, waveforms are
put into the system memory so, when
they are no longer needed, the memory
should be cleared using the ERASE
co m ma nd
This command is probably the most
limited o f  all the sound commands
(which ar e i n  themselves limited).
When this command is issued within a
program there is a single audible beep
and the screen ﬂashes once. Note that
there is a bug in the BEEP command.
See the later section on bugs for a
deﬁnition of this.
The SAY command takes a string of
phonetic codes a n d  speaks t hem
according t o  a predeﬁned array o f
parameters. T h e  parameters array
includes deﬁnitions  f o r  P it c h ,
Inﬂection, Speech Rate, M a le  o r
Female Voic e,  T uning, V o  u me,
Channel, Mode and Control, Most of
these parameters are self-explanatory
apart from the last two. Mode allows
you to set Synchronous or Asynchro-
nous speech. Control gives control
over speech interruption when Mode is
set to Asynchronous.
TRANSLATEin
This is a very useful command since it
will convert ordinary English text into
Phonetic codes for use with the SAY
command. This makes life easier, but
some control over the speech is lost,
because t h e  tr ans lator  lib r a r y ,
YOUR AMIGA may 1987
20
although v ery  good, i s  sometimes
inaccurate. Also the Translator library
will give y our speech an American
accent. Using SAY with Phonetic code
will overcome this.
'That concludes the Sound and
Speech commands, and unlik e the
graphics commands, they 'are all listed
above. A s  y ou c an see, although
speech is pretty well covered, Amiga
Basic lacks in the sound department.
Data Files
Amiga Basic can handle two types of
data ﬁle  namely  R A N D O M  a n d
SEQUENTIAL. These are very easy to
set up and use.
SEQUENTIAL
These ﬁles are easier t o  use than
Random ﬁles but are also slightly more
limited and slower. This is due to the
fact that data is  stored as  ASC II
characters. In order to access the Nth
piece o f  data, characters zero to N
must be read ﬁrst.
Sequential ﬁles  mu s t  ﬁr s t h e
opened with a mode speciﬁer. This can
be Read. Wr ite o r  Append. Y o u
cannot open a sequential to Read and
Write at the same time. The ﬁle must
ﬁrst be closed and re-opened. I f  a
Sequential ﬁle  containing data i s
opened with a Write mode speciﬁer
instead of an Amend mode speciﬁer,
then all data in the ﬁle is lost.
An optional parameter, that can be
speciﬁed in the Open command, is the
Buffer size. This tells the computer
how many characters to Read in or
Write out in one go. The default for
this is 128 Bytes but this can be de-
creased o r  increased a s  desired,
Increasing the buffer size speeds up ﬁle
I/O but makes heavier demands on
memory, s o, obviously, users must
reach a happy compromise.
RANDOM
Random ﬁles  a r e  s lightly  mor e
cumbersome to set up and use than
Sequential ﬁles  b u t  t h e  beneﬁts
attained may well make the extra work
worthwhile. Amiga Basic Random
ﬁles are very fast and are accessed via
their records number.
The A m i g a  B a s ic  m a n u a r s
coverage of  the commands are inter-
changeable between t h e  t w o  data
formats, often only requiring different
parameters.

EVENT TRAPPING
Event trapping is a means of creating
the impression o f  two simultaneous
operations. Certain events in Amiga
Basic can be trapped and a speciﬁc
routine can be jumped to for servicing
the event. The program ﬂow is then
passed back to the stage previous to
the event trap. The most common trap.
also found on many other computers,
is ON ERROR. whereby. if an error
condition occurs within the program.
an error routine is executed and then
the program is either terminated or re-
started depending on the nature of the
error,
Amiga Basic supports a  wider
range o f  Event trapping than most
Basics and can trap events for TIMER,
MENU. M O U S E ,  E R R O R  a n d
competitors because s ome o f  the
techniques ac hiev ed w i t h  eYent
trapping are not possible in standard
Basics.
Event trapping is  very easy t o
initiate and use, ﬁrstly the user must
build a routine that is going to handle
an giv en event. This just takes the
form o f  a standard subroutine. A n
example is to decrement an on screen
timer every second. The routine will
purely decrement the screen display.
There is no need for any event checks
because this routine will be called only
on the timer trap. Next we must acti-
vate Timer  event trapping, this  is
accomplished by issuing a TIMER ON
Command.
We now have to tell Amiga Basic
where we want to go and on which
event. Easy, we just say: ON TIMER
) GOSUB Routinename. This will
execute our subroutine called Routine-
name once every second from now on
or until event trapping is switched oft'
with ON TIMER ( I)  GOSUB O. An
ON EVENT  GOSUM 0  stops event
trapping for the EVENT speciﬁed.
MOUSE
This traps the user when the left mouse
button is pressed and is activated by
MOUSE O N : O N  M O U S E  ( 0 )
GOSUM Routinename. This type of
eyent trapping is useful for on screen
mouse selections.
MENU
Providing you have set up menus using
Amiga Basic's MENU command this
aent traps the user pressing the right
mouse button and selecting a menu
A M I G A  B A S I C
option. Pull down menus should be
used whenever possible as this gives
your program professionalism and
user friendliness.
Menu trapping is initiated with ON
MENU:ONMENU GOSUB Routine-
name. Interrogating menu selections is
fairly straightforward. T h e  M e n u
Number selected is held in Menuld and
the Menu Item selected is found in the
Menultem variable. I n  the case o f
Menu trapping the Routinename in
ON M E N U  G O SU B w i l l  b e  a
subroutine t o decipher which menu
and men item was selected and then
executing another subroutine accord-
ing to that selection.
BREAK
This allows trapping of the users trying
to s top a  programs execution b y
pressing Right Amiga/Full Stop. The
event i s  initialised w it h  B R E A K
ON:ON BR EAK GOSUM Routine-
name. The Routine called Routine-
name could just contain a RETURN,
this would have the effect of disabling
the Break sequence and nothing else.
COLLISION
This allows programmers t o  detect
collisions on Objects (images created
us ing t h e  0  B J E c r _ s t i  APE
command). Detection of collisions can
be inter-object or object to window.
Event trapping or object collisions are

COLLISION GOSUB Routinename.
Routinename can be a subroutine to
ascertain which object has collided
using the COLLISION command.
Filer
Filer is an example program that can
be typed in and used immediately and
shows exactly h o w  a  l o t  o f  the
commands above work. Some of the
programming style is none to subtle. It
was originally written for my own use
but I  have decided to put it in this
article without too many changes.
Filer can be used for storing any
type o f  record that will ﬁt into its
Format. There are eight ﬁles each of
which c a l l  c ontain a l l  unlimited
number of records. The record format
is 99 chars max ﬁrst ﬁeld, 25 chars max
for next four ﬁelds and one char max
for the ﬁnal ﬁeld. Filer could be used
for storing addresses and telephone
numbers.

Operating Instructions
To make your own custom disk you
will require the Filer disk in drive 0
(internal) and a blank (formatted)disk
in drive I (external).
When Filer is ﬁrst loaded and run it
checks the disk in drive Ito see if it isa
valid data disk, there are two things
which can occur at this point.
A. Filer will see that this is a data
disk created earlier already containing
some records. I f  this is the case y ou
will be taken into the Workscreen.
B. Filer will see that this disk contains
no records or ﬁles, In this case Filer
will realise the disk is  a  new one
previously formatted and will write the
setup tiles to it
Whichever option F iler  chooses
you will eventually arrive at the Work-
screen. This is the screen where all of
the record entry is performed. There
are various menus situated at the top
of the Worksereen in the screens Title
Bar. The options provided by  these
Menus will be outlined below.
Main Furies Menu
WRITE REC: This option is used for
actually creating the records. The last
record number ﬁled will be displayed.
The n e x t  rec ord number  i n  t h e
sequence will be displayed awaiting a
new record to be entered. The informa-
tion for DAT A 1 is entered ﬁrst (max
length 9 9  characters). Next D A T A
2,DATA 3.DATA 4 and DAT A 5 are
entered (max length 25 characters);
Finally D AT A 6 is entered (max one
character). Finally you are asked if you
wish to enter another.
READ REC: This option allows you to
look at a particular record by entering
its number. This is useful when a print-
out h a s  been made a n d  rec ord
numbers are taken from this. Enter —1
to leave Read Record Mode.
CLEAR SCN: This  option does a
simple screen clear useful for  some
options that do not automatically clear
themselves.
QUIT FILER: Always use this option
to leave Filer. This is the only way to
update the disk ﬁle which tells FILER
the ﬁle names and how many records
each tile contains on re-entry. I f  you
exit from Filer in any other way all
work from the current session will be
lost!

Utilities Menu
LAST REC: This option allows you to
display the number of the last record
stored under a particular ﬁle. Use this
option t o  monitor the number o f
records under each ﬁle.
ALL RECS: This option displays all of
the records within the chosen ﬁle from
a selected record number. The last
record number is displayed and you
are then prompted f o r  a  record
number from wrhich to start display-
ing. F o r  example i f  you have 500
records under a tile and you enter ISO
at the prompt then records from ISO to
SOO will be displayed on the monitor.
AMEND REC: This option allows for
the correction of  mistakes on a par-
ticular record, y ou must k now the
number of the record to be amended to
use this option, this is useful once a
printout has  been performed and
checked. An y  mistakes located can
then be corrected using the Amend
Option.
DISK D I R :  T his  option gives a
Directory listing of the ﬁles on the data
disk.
PRINT ALL: This option will print all
the records from the selected ﬁle to
printer. Do not select this option if you
do not have a printer connected or if it
is currently ofﬂine. Print All is useful
for going through all of the records on
a particular ﬁle with the aim of making
any corrections necessary.
File Select Menu
There are no preset items under this
menu, the contents are taken from the
current rec ord dis k  inserted. F o r
example if when you loaded Filer you
had a Data Disk created earlier with
Filer inserted in drive I then the eight
items under this menu would be the
names o f  any ﬁles you created and
UNUSED f o r  a n y  ﬁles  n o t  y e t
allocated.
If you select one of these ﬁles then
all of the record based options in the
Utilities and Main Funcs Menus will
work upon this  ﬁle. T o  wor k  o n
another ﬁle select a new one from the
File Select Menu.
Alternatively i f  you have a new
disk inserted the items will all read
UNUSED.
If one of these items is selected then
Filer will prompt you for a ﬁle name
A M I G A  B A S I C
which must be seven characters long.
Graphics and DOS
One of the most exciting things that
can be done in Amiga Basic is to call
system routines contained within the
Graphics and DOS libraries, although
to d o  this  y ou w i l l  need t o  be
conversant with the Amiga Libraries.
The system routines ar e called
using the DECLARE FUNCTION,
LIBRARY and CALL functions with-
in A m ig a  Basic. T h e  L I B R A R Y
function calls a library from disk (if it
is not already resident in memory) and
opens it up ready for access via the
CALL func tion. T h e  D E C L A R E
FUNCTION statement is used to tell
Amiga Basic which system functions
you are going to be accessing.
A lot of the system libraries require
fairly complex parameters but here
will concentrate on the simpler func-
tions requiring only one argument.
Let's take an example, the graphics
library contains the functions MOVE
and D R A W .  These t w o  functions
allow you to specify a start point with
MOVE and a  dr aw t o  point with
DRAW. Using this method of access-
ing the libraries achieves very fast line
drawing. Let's say we want a program
that draws a line from a point 100,100
to a point 200,200. First we must open
the system's graphics library  a n d
declare the two functions we are about
to use with:
DECLARE F U N C T I O N  Mov e(  1
LIBRARY
DECLARE F UNCT IO N D r a w  (  )
LIBRARY
LIBRARY "graphics. library"
The next step is to move the cursor
to the start point 100,100. We achieve
this by calling the MOVE function:
CALL Move&(100,000)
We add the & symbol to the end of
Draw because Draw is a variable. This
has now moved our graphics cursor to
point 100,100. We must now Draw the
line:
CALL Draw&000.2.001
Voila! a line appears on the screen.
There will be some example listings
later for those of you that wish to try
out some actual code.
Another reason f o r  us ing t h e
system routines within your programs,
YOUR AMIGA may 1987
22
apart from speed, is to overcome some
of the limitations of Amiga Basic. One
such limitation is  found in the text
positioning commands. Normally text
is positioned o n  a  graphics screen
using t h e  A m ig a  Bas ic  func tion
L O C AT E.  U n f o r t u n a t e l y  t h i s
function o n ly  work s  t o  character
spacing and not pixel spacing.
But what if we want to place text on
the screen starting at a particular pixel.
We can achieve this using the Graphics
Library function MOVE just as we did
above, Use MOVE to locate the cursor
to the required pixel position and then
just do a standard PRINT. Using this
method of placing text on the screen
gives n o  lim it a t io n s  t o  e x a c t
positioning.
A word of  warning at this point,
before you can use any of the system
libraries you must create what is called
a Bmap.ﬁle for each library you wish
to access. This ﬁle is constructed using
the program called Fd.Convert sup-
plied along with Amiga Basic on the
Extras disk.
The examples below will not work
without the associated Bmap.ﬁles.

Examples
Most of Example I should be clear to
you. C-PROGNAME is where you will
substitute the name of the piece of code
you wish to execute followed by any
parameters required by the code. Also
you need t o  chdir to the directory
containing t h e  Bmap.ﬁle f o r  this
particular Library, i.e. in this case the
Bmap.ﬁle for the "dos, library" is in
the directory bmap.ﬁles on drive O.
This example allows you to run
object code (programs) written in C,
68000, Modula2 etc. from within your
own Basic programs. This can be very
useful on two counts. Firstly if you can
already program some other language
but are working in Basic and ﬁnd that
Basic is too slow, all you need to do is
write a short piece of code, and then
call that from Basic as shown above.
The second count is  where you
need t o run a piece of  speciﬁc code

written b y  someone else and then
utilise t h e  results i n  y o u r  o w n
program. This could be used for things
like calling Showilbm to display IFF
pictures and then returning to Basic
for you to render into the pictures from
Basic.

Overall Amiga Basic is  a  Nrery
comprehensive language a n d  o n e
which I quite enjoyed using although
at times it was very frustrating. A lot of
the inadequacies have been ironed out
in the 1.2 version which should be
available soon. In fact a lot of you may
have it by the time of reading this.

ONE ON ONE
Despite the restricting scenario and screen playing area of a
one on one basketball match. One on One is a very addictive
and enjoyable game. There are many subtle variations of skill
level - make sure that you start i n  the park" to give you rsella
diance. Options are available between games from pull down
menus.
One of the features that is going to make Amiga games
•tand apart from the rest is the digitised sound which can be
.ncorporated into a game to give it added realism. In One on
' t h e  crowd noise is just that, a recorded basketball crowd
• • •.liplete with yells of "Shoot". The referee even yells out the
howls. "offensive charging" and the sound o f  the ball
houncing is very realistic. It's a sort of Harlem Globetrotters
cartoon but you are in there controlling one of the players.
The graphics and music are a bit ordinary but the game
itself is relaxing light entertainment and one I keep going back
to for a bit of fun. Mouse control is also supported so you can
p la y %vith the basic system.

software it may be with vast computer generated territories to
explore, complex maps and elements of skill and planning
required to succeed, but it lacks immediacy and doesn't really
use the Amiga to its full. The opening screen of an an
hand writing the title with appropriate swash buckling music
is the high point.
Some token sprite graphics are employed at the court of
the European king before you set out on your journey of
discovery t o  the west, Despite a  shine m a n u a l full o f
information, the lack of on-screen prompts is annoying. Some
genuine historical content w ould hav e sustained mor e
interest.
Seven Cities provides your ﬁrst map and game but also
offers the option to create your own map discs. So, if this is
'our sort o f  game, the lifespan is  indeﬁnite. A  lifetime
exploring with Seven Cities and trading with mythical natives
is not an option I would personally consider and I think that
conventional adventure formats still have more to oiler in way
of excitement,
Joystick is needed because both keyboard and mouse
control is very awkward. Unless you are rally besotted with
strategy type games then this one can be given a miss.

MEAN GAME OF GOLF
What is it about the Amiga and golf? Do those stripey-
suited marketing men reckon that the sophisticated Amiga
user leaves go of the mouse only to take up his dubs? Maybe
they're right since 1 was happy to take up the challenge laid
down b y  Accolade's Mean 18 golf game and t o  draw
comparisons with Leaderboard.
From a playing point of view, Mean 18 lives up to its name
with accurate and difﬁcult t o  master representations o f
famous courses such as St.Andrews. Augusta National and
Pebble Beach. There is much less tolerance oa bad play in
Mean 18 than in Leaderboard and the Mean 18 practice
feature is a necessary preliminary phase to get a feel for the
controls and to ﬁnd your own balance of power and accuracy,
Mean 18 doesn't take you round the course as smoothly as
Leaderboard since you need to click the mouse button too

often to prompt the next stage. Television techniques like fade
and dematerialise. clever though they are, slow down the pace
of the game.
The nitilliple Options on players -  up to four types of
scoring - stroke. match and best ball: tees -  professional or
regular: N kill -  experienced or beginner, make for variation.
Beginners get caddie advice on club choice as well as perfect
aim. Game options are practice (tee, green or a hole of your
choice). begin round and quit. You can save a game in
progress for later retrieval.
am not too fond of the graphics which make up the
course although utilising consistent shades for fairway, light
rough. deep rough etc. helps the player. The main let-down is
the play on the green with an overhead view of the putting
surfaces. It destroys any feeling of realism, is awkward in use
and reminds me too much of a snooker simulation.
A major plus for the potent ion DIY golf course designer is
the Architect supplied with Mean 18. The example ﬁctitious
course. Rush Hill, shows what it can do. So if you want to
simulate a round at your local links. Architect is the answer.
It's quite a complicated matter so you may have to restrict
your immediate ambitions to your favourite hole! You can
'paint' and s e t  down trees (which may be modiﬁed) and
bushes, modify the skyline, change the shape and position of
the green, place the tee and set par for the hole.
There's plenty of attention to detail in Mean 18 with club
choice and terrain combining f o r  the likeliest results.
Although Leaderboard has replied to the classic courses idea
with a new set o f  'realistic' courses, Mean 18*s Architect
remains unique. I think Leaderboard is the neater design but
Mean 18 has more features for the money and provides a
tougher challenge at 'professional' level.

TOUCH OF TRIVIA
Trivia Trove from Enigma is software for those who enjoy
showing off their general knowledge. If you always win the
ubuquitous TV quiz shows like Bob's Full House while lazing

back in your armchair then Trivia Trove will test you further.
It will also enable you to devise your Own questions in a sort of
'Trivia Construction Set'. This trivia generator manages a tile
of up to 500 questios. letting you edit them, print them out for
checking and ﬁnally saving to disc for retrieval by the game.
All question data is saved on the Amiga's external disc drive
and Trivia Trove relies on a two disc system to work.
The game consists of different levels and is like some of the
arcade machine trivia games and nothing like Trivial Pursuit.
The displays are attractively drawn but there could perhaps
have been scope for some sound effects?
Each level of Trivia Trove can be completed by answering
the appropriate number of questions correctly. The questions
are 'chosen' bv the player by, typically, clicking on a mouse
button as the desired subject area is highlighted. Some of these
'choices' are crucial to the game, as in Level 2 where the
sluggishness of the software reacting to the mouse introduces
an undesirable random effect. You have a time limit to select
the correct answer to the question.
Packaging and documentation is mininlat and 'home-
made'. In general. it's a game I enjoyed. If you have a use for
the question and answer database then you are getting real
value for money.

Archon
Without dount, this is a tremendous game and an original one
despite the familiar chessboard layout. It makes good use of
the Amiga's qualities with smooth graphics and imaginative
sound. The opening sequence is like that of a short ﬁlm or
cartoon w i t h  des ign a n d  programming credits. T h e
documentation is fulsome, with a quick reference card for the
various "pieces
complexities of luminance cycles.c asting spells and charmed
squares and it does so with a fair bit of humour.
I certainly felt I'd got my money's worth, especially since it
call be a two player game. No humans in tonight? Then play
the computer. Depending on the current abilities (standard to
advanced) as declared by the combatants, a handicapping
system ensures a close game.
Watch out though: Yo u  can only  play Archon with
joystick and you'll need two for the two player mode since
direct combat is ivolved. Whenever icons clash on a square at
the "strategic" level, combat is joined. The two icons duel
with the weapon that is  their speciality, with the tactics
appropriate to their style of ﬁghting and for as long as their
allotted lifeline will allow.
Even i n  victory, t he icons c an become weakened.
Depending on many factors they may recover somewhat or
remain weak. easy prey to another hostile icon. The wizard

central ﬁgures in the game. their spell casting can turn the tide
in their favour through use of magic to REVIVE, HEAL.

doing battle. The knights and goblings are the grafters of the
two sides, light and dark. By getting close and sticking with
the opponent they can come up with surprising results, There
are ﬂightier characters, zombie rock throwers, ﬁreball ﬁrers
and twangers (archer and Manticore). The banshees are
deadly when skilfully ﬂown in close. The Phoenix seems to
ﬂatter to deceive but the power is there to be harnessed.
The dual personality of Archon - light and dark, tactician
and warrior, the speed of battle but the calculation strategy
demanded for victory - makes it an absorbing game. The two

MARBLE MADNESS
When the Amiga became public property the game Marble
Madness was instantly associated with it because the graphics
served as an early demo of what the computer could do. Now
the classic arcade hit is available for all to play. Nor is it just
showy graphics; I t's st unn in g music and a game to stretch your
nerves taught as the time counts down with your goal in view,
screen after screen.

The game disk is recognised by Work Bench - the Amiga's
icon graphic/mouse environment - and you double click the
disc icon and then the marble icon to boot the game into
action. The opening screen is ordinary, The author. Larry
Reed, for whom I have the greatest admiration, saved the best
for the game.
Screen one, the practice run, is mastered fairly quickly.
The landscape is red and yellow with black gridlines. The
three dimensional graphics are excellent, the accompanying
tune snappy, percussive, urging you on, into the groove,
rolling realistically towards the GOAL area at the end of the
path. The pattern is set for  the other, more complicated
screens, to come. You should be getting plenty of bonus points
for time left after just a few runs.
Screen two and new music, a blue landscape, a deep base
bounce as you ricochet, pinball like, from the 3D blocks.
There's an agressive black marble which you can force off the
edge of the playing surface for !MOO points, green/yellow
dolly mixture creatures which send your marble into a spin
and try their best to leap on top of it - a sticky end. You have
to negotiate ramps and bridges, spin down metallic pipes and
be ready to control your marble on a strangely angled surface
at the bottom of the shine. kgreen shaded surface. gleaming
like an empty swimming pool in the sun, puts the skids under
your marble for a ﬁnal spurt to the in-GOAL area. Finished.
By now I'v e discovered that joystick control is  very
interior to mouse control. The original game used trackball
and a trackball option is available for the Amiga game. I
haven't been able to try it so mouse is next best. Two types of
trackball, jovstick and mouse are supported, as is one and two
player mode. The input device can be assigned to front or back
port. The choices are offered alter each completed game. You
can also increase the difﬁculty level (less time per screen) at
this point (range 0 to 7). The two player version means two
marbles contending for the same space and can make for some
very aggressive play!
Each screen is a time trial. You can lose control of your
marble and it may drop beyond the 3D playing area and over
the edge with a heart rending scream/whine. An animated
hrush may come in and sweep away the broken pieces! The
marble will always be spun back into position but time is
ticking away. The marble may be injured and give out a yell
and spin in pain. You start to get emotionally attached to your
marble! The faster you complete the early screens the more
chance you have of success later on so you have to balance
bonus points against the time taken to get them.
On to screen three. Dropping in a controlled fashion! from
a slide, the marble has to negotiate a groove cut in the surface.
Vital seconds can be wasted in this awk ward maze. The screen
is dark. the colours and music foreboding. The tempo
quickens as you try to didge the green slime that dissolves your
marble instantly on contact. Rolling down a red metallic shaft
brings more points. The paths get even thinner and a sharp
rising corner ﬁnishes the screen. GOAL!
Screen four. red and gold graphics and the aerial race
bonus. The marble drops from a high platform ( like an
elevated golf tee), down a slide and out into space. As you hit
the platform below, you have to employ reverse thrust on the
mouse to stay around. I titling the joystick or mouse button
gives the marble a temporary boost in speed. This can now be
used to ,iump gaps in the paths. It is also needed to rush past
the vacuum cleaner-like heads which pop up and, vibrating.
suck at your marble, throwing it off course and, if it gets held

in the suction. destroying it completely.
The marble also ﬁnds itself catapulted from one platform
to another. On landing a really agressive black marble gets
alter you. You're lucky to stay abovc ground at this point.
Metal rods now poke up from the path. steering you over the
edge. As  well as negotiating the corners you have three
malicious rubber hammers popping up out of trap doors to
dislodge you, working in unison to bring a frustrating end to a
brilliant run to GOAL.

climbing thin ramps arid being suckled up pipes. A new and
deadly airborne peril further complicates the perilous journey
of your marble. Great tune.
Get through this one and it's on to the ultimate level. Out
in space with an icey surface to make changing direction
extremely difﬁcult. Progress is further delayed by bridges that
form before your eves.
The music which accompanies each level plays a great part
in hook ing the player into the game. Sequencer style
electronic sounds combine with electronic piano chords and
the s ound effects unique t o  computer games. These
accompany the marble as it slides down shutes arid hits rough

From the moment that Apple released

the market exploded, until soon there
were hundreds o f products ranging

Starting Out
To create a page Pagesetter works in a
series of 'boxes', Each box, created by
the user, can be any size and can
contain either graphics or text. There
are two ways of creating boxes. Either
you can pick the box icon, and create a
box on the screen. or you can import a
picture o r  sonic text from outside
PageSetter and use th e  A  utobos
function to create a box of the right
size.
Boxes can be as big or small as the
user wants, and in order that long
passages of text can be included, boxes
can also be linked. When setting up the
page, it is always necessary to zoom in
on certain sections and PageSeuer uses

of some of the available effects_ In this
mode i t  is  possible t o  change the
texture for  the box background, the
style of border, the font for the box, the
justiﬁcation, and so on.
Graphics
In addition to complex text layouts.
Pagesetter allows  the user t o  add
graphics anywhere o n  t h e  page.
Although PageSetter comes with a
variety of basic pictures. it is the ability
to impor t I F F  (International F ile

as Deluxe Paint and Aegis hnages that
allows the user to create some truly
stunning layouts. To make the most of
the graphics ability to Page,S

As w ith any  complex program
PageSetter takes some getting used to,
and many early pages will he no more
than a n  unr elated c ollec tion o f

however, is one o f  the best ways to

has the ability to create a document of
up to 99 pages long. However, as the

between 7k and 10k, most unexpanded
Amigas w ill b e able t o  produce a
document u p  to about 40 pages in
length.
Editors
Although PageSetter is  intended
primarily as a page design and layout
package, i t  does contain powerful
graphics and text editors that, because
they were designed speciﬁcally for the
package, are often better suited for
producing graphics and text than other
'external' programs. T h e  graphic
editor has several features that make it
unique, and perfect for DTP.
First and foremost it is black and
white. This is because eventually it will
be printed, and very few people have

colour printers. To make the most of
the graphic editor, there are a variety
of shades that can be used, and if you

certainly be very unpredictable.
Another m a i n  differ enc e i s
that Pacesetter uses a  graphics
resolution of 640 x 200, whereas most
graphics packages uses 320 X 200. This
is to maintain as close as possible a
correlation between the screen and the
printer on which the hard copy will be
produced. The graphic editor has a
variety o f  functions that will allow
most artists (or in my case idiots) to
create something that appears to be a
picture, although the quality o f  the
picture i s ,  a s  alway s , dir ec t ly
correlated to the amount of time you
spend producing it. Once you have
created a  masterpiece, i t  w i l l  b e
necessary to frame it, in order that its
size c a n  b e  manipulated, a n d
eventually so that it will ﬁt in the hole
you have made for it!
Although t he graphic editor is
important, the part o f  the program
that most serious users will spend most
Lime with is the text editor. As with its
graphics sibling, the tex t editor is
different in  many ways t o  external
word processors. Because of the power
of PageSetter's o w n  for matting
commands, i t  tr eats  f or mat t ing
commands in improved text as words,
which must therefore be removed by
hand, Thankfully, the program can
successfully import text from either

Manual On
Most users of PageSetter will, it seems
YOUR AMIGA may 1987
33
to be expected, complete novices to the
world of publishing and, to that end,
the manual spends a great deal of its
time telling the user how to set out
pages. and how to grab the readers
attention. Thankfully this is done in a
matter of fact manner and surprisingly
manages t o  a v o i d  b e i n g  t o o
patronising. Chapters deal with setting
up newsletters, creating advertise-
ments, and laying out a page with a
photograph.
Summing Up
As you would expect on a program
such as this, the fonts available are
only those that the Amiga provides
(table 1), and there is no facility for the
user to deﬁne or import any new ones.
When compared t o  t h e  lik es  o f
PageMaker on the Apple Macintosh,
PageSetter seems to be very Basic, but
then i t  nev er  c laimed t o  b e  a

However, for  anyone who wants to

ticket. It is easy to use, comes with an
excellent manual, and teaches many of
the fundamentals  necessary f o r
successful DTP.
Considering the poor quality of a

for the Amiga, including some o f
Commodore's own, it is refreshing to
ﬁnd a company that cares enough to
put this much work into a product.

Programmers cast their vote!
Right now, leading software developers
are hard at work on the next generation
of Amiga:k products. To  add the
spectacular sound effects we've all
come to expect from Amiga software,
they are overwhelmingly choosing one
sound recording package...
FutureSound. As one developer put it,
"FutureSound should be standard
equipment for the Amiga."
FutureSound the clear winner...
Why has FumreSound become the clear
choice for digital sound sampling on the
Amiga? The reason is obvious: a
hardware design that has left nothing
out. FutureSound includes two input
sources, each with its own ampliﬁer,
one for a microphone and one for direct
recording; input volume control; high
speed 8-bit parallel interface, complete
with an additional printer port; extra
ﬁlters that take care of everything from
background hiss to interference from
"Open the pod bay doors, HAL..."
the monitor, and of course, a
microphone so that you can begin
recording immediately.
What about software?
FutumSound transforms your Amiga
into a powerful, multi-track recording
studio. Of course, this innovative
software package provides you with all
the basic recording features you expect.
But with FutureSound, this is just the
beginning. A  forty-page manual will
guide you through such features as
variable sampling rates. visual editing,
mixing, special effects generation, and
more. A  major software publisher is
soon to release a simulation with an
engine roar that will rattle your teeth.
This incredible reverberation effect was
designed with FutumSound's software.

Question: What can a 300 pound
space creature do with these
sounds?
Answer: Anything he wants.
Since FutureSound is IFF compatible
(actually three separate formats are
supported) your sounds can be used by
most Amiga sound applications. With
FutureSound and Deluxe Video
Construction Set from Electronic Arts,
your video creations can use the voice
of Mr. Spock, your mother-in-law, or a
disturbed super computer.
Programming support is also provided.
Whether you're a "C" programming
wiz or a Sunday afternoon BASIC
hacker, all the routines you need are on
the non-copy protected diskette.
Your Amiga dealer should have
FutureSound in stock. If not, just

The memory map can be considered to
consist of two layers. The bottom layer
is a block of 64K of RAM. On top of
this are superimposed two areas o f
ROM and other chips. Since different
devices occupy the same addresses, a
register at address one is used to decide
which are switched in. In normal use,
the R A M  under th e  R OMs i s
unavailable to Basic but it can be used
for graphics.
The 64 treats the block of RAM as
four banks of 16k:
Bank0-$0000-$3FFR0 to 16383).
Bank 144000-$7FFF(16384 to 32767)
Bank2-$80004BFFF(32768 to49151)
Bank 3-SC000-SFETT(49152 to 65535
Bank 0 is the default bank. The
bank in use is speciﬁed in bits 0 and 1
of location SDD00.
The VIC  can only address one
bank at a time and it expects to ﬁnd an
area of screen memory and a character
set withing the bank. This approach
offers almost unlimited ﬂexibility but
also makes the use of graphics in the
default bank restricted.
Since the CPU and the VIC chip
operate independently, th e  C PU
doesn't care which bank is used for
graphics. We can therefore reconﬁgure
the machine from Basic very easily.
Let us consider how to reconﬁgure
the memory map.
Changing the BANK
This is achieved easily by changing the
register at SDDOO:
10 POKE 56578, PEEK(56578) OR 3
20 POKE 56576, (PEEK(56576) AND
252) 011(3-BN)
Line 10 prepares the ground and
line 20 switches in BANK number BN.
The VIC chip ignores the absolute
address of the bank and uses only the
relative addresses within the bank, i.e.
each bank ranges from 80000 to
S3FFF.
Moving the Character Set
The register at 53272 tells the VIC chip
where to get its character data. In fact,
bits one to three hold this information.
This information is changed by:
POKE 5 3 2 7 2 , (PEEK(5 3 2 7 2 )
AND240) OR X

SIMPLIFIED MEMORY MAP
X is equal to the start adress of the
character data divided by 1024. With
only three bits used, only eight
character sets are possible i.e. x  =
0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.
Since the machine powers up with a
character set, there must be default
information somewhere. In fact, the
default character set is held in ROM.
This data is imaged to banks 0 and 2
and i s  found a t  th e  following
addresses:
$1000-$17ET (Lower case set X=4)
$1800-$IFFF (Upper case set X=6)
Clearly, i t is possible to have a
number of different sets of characters
in a bank and simply switch between
them as needed.
Moving the Screen
The screen comprises of 1000 bytes of
contiguous memory which usually
resides between locations 1024 and
2024. This position is speciﬁed in bytes
4 to 7 in location 53272. These bytes
actually specify the position o f the
screen in any bank of memory, and can
be changed by:
POKE 53272, (PEEK(53272) ANDI5)
OR Y
Y is equal to the start address of the
screen divided by 64. This time we have
four bits in the register allowing 16
possible screen positions w i th  Y
ranging from 0 to 240 in increments of
16. Unfortunately, you cannot use all
Y

RAM areas for the screen. If you use
the areas imaged b y the character
ROM, you will get garbage on the
screen.
In addition to changing the VIC
register, y o u  must also tell th e
operating system where the screen is.
This is done with:
POKE 648,SCREEN/256
where SCREEN is the start address of
the screen area,
The screen colour matrix cannot be
moved and, i n  fact, presents n o
difﬁculties.
Listing I allows you to reconﬁgure
your 64. The ﬁrst part asks you to
specify where the screen and character
set are to go. These values are checked
to ensure that they are in the same
bank and are not at the same address.
It doesn't check any further so beware.
Line 60 to 80 calculate the register
values. Line 90 checks to see i f you
need to copy down the character set
and lines 100 to 150 do this job i f
required. Lines 160 to 190 reconﬁgure
the machine.

In my view, the crucial part of any
piece.
Run Listing I putting the screen at
50176 and the character table at 51200
and then enter the line:
POKE 44,4: POKE 1024, 0: NEW
You will have a machine offering
39933 bytes for Basic and 144 sprites.
That's a lot more than you get on
switch o n ! This extra capacity i s
achieved by:
1) Using BANK 3 and moving the
screen and character set to a handy
block of RAM between the ROMs.
2) Moving the start of Basic program
storge down t o  1025. Since we've
moved the screen we can use the
normal screen area for Basic.
3) You can use the memory behind the
Kernal ROM ($E000 to SFEFF) and
the remaining memory between the
ROMs ($C000 to $C3FF) for sprites.
Machine code users don't have
such a tough time since they aren't
constrained by where they have to put
their programs. I t  is, nevertheless,
useful to reconﬁgure the machine.
Graphics Modes
Before we launch forth into graphics
handling, w e  must consider th e
graphics modes available to us. The
screen occupies 1000 bytes and is
divided into 64000 addressable points
or pixels. There are two graphics
modes allowing manipulation of the
screen.
1. Character Mode
In this default mode, the screen uses
C64 G R A P H I C S
1000 characters, each occupying an
8x 8 pixel cell.
2. Bit mapped mode
In this mode, the screen uses a 320 by
200 array of pixels. Using this mode it
is possible to create pictures and other
images.
The fundamental difference
between these modes is that character
mode is supported by the operating
system whereas bit map mode has no
software to drive it. Both modes use
KK 8 cells to control the colours used.
In addition to the graphics modes,
there are three colour modes.
I. High resolution mode
This is the default graphics mode. In
this mode, any given cell may contain
only two colours; the background or
paper colour and the foreground or
ink colour. Any set pixel will have the
ink colour and any unset pixel will
have the paper colour.
In character mode, the paper
colour is held in VIC register 53281
and the ink colour is held in the colour
matrix.
This mode allows the greatest
detail, albeit at the most limited colour
range.
2. Multi-colour Mode
In this mode, pairs of pixels are used to
deﬁne dots of colour. Since there are
four possible arrangements for two
pixels, foru colours are allowed in any
given character cell (Table 2).

This mode is a lot coarser but
allows greater colour ﬂexibility.
Extended Background
This mode uses high resolution but
offers four different paper colours in
addition to the usual ink colours. The
paper colour is determined by the

limits you to 64 different characters
(Table 3).
Redeﬁned characters
OK, we've done the spade work, let's
now look at the use o f user deﬁned
characters.
You will have realised that the
shape of characters is held in a table of
data. Exactly how i s  o f  essence.
Consider Figure 2 . This shows a
character design. T h e  design
comprises o f  eight lines o f  dots.
Imagine that each set pixel is a 1 and
each clear pixel ISO. That being so. the
top line becomes 00111100. Th e
decimal equivalent o f  this binary
number is 60. Similarly, each line can
be converted to  a data value. The
character table comprises o f  a
sequence o f  data values fo r  each
character. The ﬁrst eight data values in
the table is used by the character
normally used by @. The second block
of eight is used by the character A. And
so on. For any given character CH, its
data values start at:
TABLE ADDRESS + CH*8
As an experiment, run Listing I as
Listing 2
10 DATA 60. 34, 34, 60, 34. 34, 60. 0
20 ch=4: FOR I=0T07: READ X
30 POKE 512004- 8*C11-1- I,X
40 NEXT
before putting the character table at
51200. Then type in and run Listing 2.
Note what happens to the letter D.
Using this approach is rather slow,
Listing 3  gives a  machine code
alternative,
This code lives at SSC000 allowing
you to  use a  relocated screen and
character set as earlier. The code has

two routines. The ﬁrst copies the ROM
characters t o  a  speciﬁed address,
rather like lines 110 to 150 but faster.

Where ADDRESS is the start of the
character table. The routine also
remembers where the character table is
so always call it ﬁrst in your program
before trying to use the second routine.
The second routine redesigns a
speciﬁed character and has the form:
SYS 49155,CH,B1.B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,
B7.B8
Where CH is the character number
and 31 to B8 are the bytes deﬁning the
character. To redeﬁne D as B as done
earlier, the command is:
SYS 49155,4,60,34,34,6034,34,60.0
For a bit of a laugh try this one:
IOSYS 49152,51200
20 F O R  I =  OT0999: P O K E
50176+L0:NEXT
30 F O R  I =  °TOT A(1 R N  D(1)*

A(4),A(5),A(6),A(7)
50 GOTO 20
Listing 3 works equally well in
multicolour and extended background
modes. T o  tu rn  o n  multicolour
character mode you must use:
POKE 53270, PEEK(53270)0RI6
To turn it off, use:
POKE 53270, PEEK(53270)AND239
To turn on extended background
mode, you must use:
POKE 53265, PEEK(53265)0R64
To turn it off, use:
POKE 53265, PEEK(53265)AND191
Bit Mapped Mode
This mode is a bit of a paradox. Whilst
on one hand it offers the greatest scope
for artistic creativity, it is also memory
hungry. In essence, it uses two or three
blocks of memory.
1. The bit map
This is an area of 64000 pixels arranged
in 200 lines of 320. This occupies 8K of
RAM.
2. The colour array
This holds the colour information and
comprises of 1000 character cells.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
96
3. The color matrix
Multicolour mode uses this area to
hold one of the colours.-
The concepts discussed earlier with
respect to telling the VIC chip where
the b i t map lies also apply here.
Register 53272 holds the details of the
bit map area (bits Ito 3) and the colour
array (bits 4 to 7). In other words the
bit map occupies the character set area
and the colour array occupies the
screen memory.
To turn on the bit map, you must
turn on bit 5 of register 53265:
POKE 53265, PEEK(53265)0R32
Register 53270 decides whether
multicolour or high resolution moces
is used:
Multicolour o n :P OK E  53270,
PEEK(53270)0R16
Multicolour o f f :  P OK E  53270,
PEEK(53270)AND239
So how do we select the colours? In
high resolution mode, the colour array
holds this information. Each character
cell value holds the paper colour in bits
0 to 3 and the ink colour in bits 4 to 7.
In multicolour, colours I and 2 are
held in the colour array with colour I
in bits 4 to 7 and colour 2 in bits 0 to 3.
Colour 0 is held in register 53281 and
colour 3 is held in the colkour matrix.
The colours are displayed by the bit
combinations:
Colour 0_0 0
Colour I...0 1
Colour 2...1 0
Colour 3_1 1
Since two pixels form a  dot in
multicolour mode, th e  horizontal
resolution is limited to 160 points,
Any given pixel in the bit map is
turned o n  w i t h  t h e  following
equations: Assuming that the pixel
coordinates are X and Y and the bit
map starts at the address BASE.
ROW = INT(Y/8)
CHAR = INT(X/8)
LINE = Y AND 7)
BIT = 7-(X AND 7)

CI =  paper colour, C2 =  ink
colour.
Multicolour mode: SYS 49 152,I,CO,

CO = paper colour
2.1teturn to text mode.
This returns you to the normal text
screen at its normal position, SYS
49155.
3. Draw point
This draws the points at X,Y with the
speciﬁed pen: SYS 49I58,X,Y,PEN
where:
PEN =  0  draws the point in paper
colour, i.e. it erases the point.
PEN = I  draws the point in ink
PEN = 2 draws the point in ink 2,
PEN = 3 draws the point in ink 3.
In high resolution mode, X must be in
the range 0  to 319. In  multicolour
mode, X must be in the range 0 to 159.
In either mode, Y must be in the range
0 to 199.
In order to keep the routine as
short as possible. I have omitted any
range checking of the co-ordinates. If
you use values outside the allowed
range, a crash may occur.

Sprites
Sprites are probably the thing which
makes games writer's lives simplest.
To those of you who don't know, a
spriate is a moveable block o f 504
pixels arranged in a block of 21 rows of

24. The design is stored in a similar
vvay to characters in that each row can
be represented by 3 bytes with the
whole design occupying 63 bytes.
These designs are stored as a sequence
of blocks i n  any given bank. The
address o f any given sprite block is
given by:
ADDRESS =  (BANK*I6384)
(BLOCK NO*641
Specifying a sprite design
The next step is to tell the VIC which
pattern block i s  t o  b e  used. A
maximum of eight sprites are possible
and each has a pointer. These pointers
are located above the screen memory
and can be found by:
POINTER ADDRESS =  SCREEN
ADDRESS + 1014 + SPRITE NO
where SPRITE NO is from 0 to 7
A power up, the screen sits at 1024
so the pointer fo r sprite 3  is a t
1024+1014+3 or 2041 To tell the VIC
which pattern to  use, you simply
POKE the block number into the
pointer, eg to set sprite I to pattern 43:
POKE 2041, 43
Turning on a Sprite
Whether or not a sprite is visible is
determined b y VIC  register 53269.
Each bit o f this register controls a
sprite. To activate sprite SP use:
POKE 53269, PEEK(53269) O R
(2 "SF)
To turn off sprite SN use:
POKE 53269, PEEK(53269) A N D
255-2 ^SP)
Expanded Sprites
Sprites can be expanded i n  both
directions to give four possible sizes.
These are controlled by two registers.
To expand sprite SP in the X direction
use
POKE 53277,PEEK(53277) O R
(2 ^SP)
To reduce it again use:
POKE 53277,PEEK(53277) A N D
(255-2 'SP)
To expand sprite SP in the Y
direction use:
C64 G R A P H I C S
POKE 53271, PEEK(5327I) O R
(2 'SP)
To reduce it again use:
POKE 53271,PEEK(5327I) A N D
(255-2 ^SP)
Colours
Each sprite has a colour register. This
is given by:
REGISTER = 53287 + SPRITE NO
This is used to specify the colour of
high resolution sprites
In multicolour sprites the colours
are selected by the usual bit pairs, see
Table 3.
The eight bits in register 53276 control
the colour mode.
To set a sprite SP to multicolour
mode use:
POKE 53276, PEEK(53276) O R
(2 'SP)
To set sprite SP to high resolution
mode use:
POKE 53276, PEEK(53276) A N D
(255-2 'SP)
Positioning a Sprite
The positioning of any given sprite on
the screen is deﬁned by its X,Y co-
ordinates. The X  co-ordinate can
range from 0 to 512 and Y co-ordinate
from 0  to  256. Each sprite has a
dedicated pair of registers. The ﬁrst
holds part o f  the X  position and
the other holds the Y co-ordinates.
They can be found from:
X Register = 53248 + SN*2
and the Y register is found from:
Y Register = 53249 + SN*2
The X  position is deﬁned in two
parts:
Most signiﬁcant b yte  (msb) =
INT( X POS/256)
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
100
Least signiﬁcant byte (Isb) = XPOS-
msb*256
Register 53264 holds the msb
details, one bit per sprite
So to position a sprite you use:
POKE XREG,LSB
POKE YREG,Y
If msb=1 th e n  P O K E  53264,
PEEK(53264) OR 2 ^SP).
If msb =0  th e n  P O K E  53264,
PEEK(53264) AND (255-2 'SP).
Priorities
Each sprite has a  priority which
decides ehtther it appears in front of or
behind the characters on the screen.
Register 53275 decides this, one bit per
sprite
To p u t sprite SP behind the
characters use:
POKE 53275, PEEK(53275) O R
(2 'SP)
To put sprite SP in front of the
characters use:
POKE 53275, PEEK(53275) A N D
(255-2 ^SP)
That's quite a mouthful and hardly
conducive to  simple programming.
Listing 6 gives the ubiquitous machine
code package.
This code has four routines.

The routine is quite smart in that it
sorts out which bank you are using and
where th e  sprite pointers are. I
therefore recommend that you use the
conﬁguration used earlier (screen at

50176 and characters at 51200. This
allows you a block of 128 sprites from
design block 128 to 255.
In Summary
In all, this has been a hefty slab of
information and I must apologise for
not giving more detail. If you want to
really get into grphics you must invest
in the Programmers Reference Guide
or something similar. Havins said that,
I believe that the routines I've given
will be useful tools.

Notes
1) All numbers wrap-round i.e. when
they get to 255 they revert to 0(and the
other way), o r  a t 15 when using

2) Entering null values (0  o r  " " )
normally exits present mode.
3) When using multi sprites be careful
that colour change and mode change
do not spoil multi sprite parameters.
Additional Notes
These are some additional notes on the
use o f the Sprite Editor. They are
meant to supplement and expand upon
the instructions and explain in detail
all available functions.
There are two forms of the sprite
editor provided, each occupying a dif-
ferent area of memory

Parameter Screen
When the Program is  run, the ﬁrst
thing that will be seen is the parameter
screen. The screen will clear and the
words 'PARAMET ER I N P U T  will
appear at the top of the screen along
with a copyright message. You will
then be asked to input a number of
variables such as Colour. Start Sprite
etc. and a cursor will appear beside t he
present value, if this value is correct
then just press Return, if not then use
delete and t h e  numerical keys t o
change it. The questions that will be
asked are as follows:
1. Start Sprite: This is the sprite that
will ﬁrst appear on the screen. Sprite
numbers are identical to the number
POKE'd t o  2048 t o  display sprites
normally. I t  is  inadvisable t o  use
sprites below 128 but for  more in-
formation s ee t h e  C ommodor e
manual_
2. Background Colour: T his  is  the

sprites will be displayed.
3. Normal Mode Colour I: This is the
colour of any hi-res sprite.
4. M / C  mode Colour I :  This is the
colour that will be given to any multi-
coloured sprite as its basic colour_
M/Colour 0 :  This is the colour that
will be given to m/c # 0 of any multi-
coloured sprite.

Editing Screen
When a l l  s ix  variables have been
deﬁned the editing screen will appear.
This can be split into three sections.
i) The editing grid.
ii) The sprite display area.
iii) The control/input line.
The editing grid is  a  block o f
squares on the left of the screen which
displays an enlarged version o f  the
current sprite. A  ﬂashing cursor will
also appear o n  the gr id and this
indicates the position of any change to
the sprite.
To the right o f  this is  a  space
coloured according to the background
colour. I t  is  on this space that the
deﬁned sprites appear.
The top line and the space above
the display area is the control/input
area whee instructions or requests will
appear.
The standard editing commands
are given in the instructions. Most of
the commands are straight-forward
but for  the more complicated ones a
more detailed description is  given
below,
0 — This controls the time interval
between changing the sprite number
and control being returned t o  the
keyboard. This is useful in animating
sprites when the upperand lower sprite
wrapround limits  can be set to the
limits of the animated sprite and + or—
is held down t o  cycle through the
images_ Var y ing t h e  delay  v alue.
changes the speed of the animation. 0
is t h e  minimum delay , 2 5 5  t h e
maximum.
A — Cursor auto advance. This allows a
preset cursor movement after any
point has been plotted. When selected
a 9 point grid will appear and below
this is the present value. The keys 0 to 8
now select t h e  direc tion o f  t h e
advance. A n y  UNPLO T  command
will act in the opposite direction. A
value of 0 turns auto advance off,
IS — Sprite print-out. Pressing this key

will pr int o u t  the currently edited
sprite o n  an MPS803 printer. The
printout will be in normal hi-res mode
only.
D — Data output. Pressing this gives
access to a sub menu.
Q — Quit mode.
— Data storage on disk. This gives
access t o  a  standard Load/Sav e
Facility.
13 — Display. This gives a numerical
screen display of the data that goes to
make up a particular sprite.
f5 — Numerical print-out. This is the
same a s  a b o v e  b u t  t o  p r in t e r
(MPS803).
Multi Sprite Mode
It is possible using the editor to create
images using more than one sprite. To
do this the sprite advance mechanism
must be turned off. This prevents the
sprites from changing when + or — is
pressed and is achieved by pressing K
to enter 'Kill mode'. An A will appear
at the top of the screen. Press K again
and B will appear. Pressing it a third
time will make the latter disappear.
Kill mode A means that only sprite
number one will follow the main grid
and in  k ill mode B  no sprites will
Follow the grid.
The number  k ey s  1 - 7  change
between sprites and the cursor keys
move them. SPACE turns the sprite on
or off and UP ARROW and BACK
ARROW expand the sprite in the x and
y directions. ( ,)  and (.) change the
sprite colours whilst + and — change
sprite numbers and 17 changes between
m/c and normal mode.
Normally only  four  sprites are
visible but pressing 12 brines the other
sprites on. Use 12 once only because
pressing it again will reset the positions
of sprites 5. 6 and 7.
N.B. When using multi-sprite mode,
be very careful about changing mode
and colours of the sprites since it will
affect all sprites and may destroy the
layout.

ability to  use characters that you
design yourself, however, when you
actually come to trying to design your
own characters you will no doubt ﬁnd
it a bit o f a chore. CEDIT 64 is a
powerful character editor that takes all
of the hard work out of designing and
storing your own character sets.
Getting It In
The program is presented in three
sections. Type each program i n
separately and store them on tape or
disk. The program CHAR ED M/C
LOAD generates a new program and
saves this onto tape or disk. If using
cassette then this new program should
be stored on the cassette after the
CHARBAS program. Th e  actual
order o f  the programs on casette
should be:
CHAR ED LOADER.
CHAR CODE (created by CHAR ED
M/C LOAD).
CHAR BASIC.
If you are using cassette then do
make sure that you make the changes
as indicated with the listings.

computers s et h ig h  standards i n
design, production and reliability.
All the hardware is built up to a
speciﬁcation rather down to a price,
unlike one or two of its competitors.
Opening u p  a n y  Commodor e
computer will show a large number of
integrated circuits which are the chips
that m a k e  t h e  c omputer  w o r k .
However, they are usually the ﬁrst
items t o  produce problems when
anything serious malfunctions in your
computer.
There can be other reasons for your
machine's failur e, a n d  m a n y  a r e
serious. If your guarantee has expired,
you may be faced with a hefty bill.
However, all is not lost. You can
usually trace the cause of a breakdown
to one or more of the ICs. Replace the
chip, and the problem is solved.
Following a simple check list, can
save pounds when it comes to repairs.
M A I N T E N A N C E
I f  you rely heavily on your computer for business or
leisure activities, then a breakdown can be infuriating.
Here are a ,few tips on simple fault .
By Mike Roberts
Your Options
Imagine a nightmare situation. You set
up your CM, plug everything in, and
connect the screen turn it all on. and
nothing! The screen is blank and the
keyboard dead.
What can you do?
Firstly, you should check the LED
on the top of the machine. If this is off
then the power supply has probably
blown. T his  i s  the only  situation
(excepting the unlikely event o f  the
LED failing) in which the LED will not
light up. If the LED is alright, then you
must test the computer.
Going Inside
First, connect a tape deck, insert a tape
in the usual manner, and press shift-
run/stop. If the tape is dead then so is
the computer.
The nex t step is  t o  check the
YOUR COMMODORE may 1987
117
internals o f  the machine. Remember
that the LED power is tapped from the
supply before the fuse. The computer
takes its power after the fuse. So this is
the ﬁrst thing that must be checked. If
it has blown then you've located the
problem, and y ou can ﬁx it  quite
simply'.
The fuse only costs a few pence and
is o f  the type BEL 3AG. one amp
250V. It is located on the right hand
side near the power socket close to the
regulating and rectifying circuitry. If
the fuse is whole, then the only other
explanation is that a section of this
circuitry is blown. But this is rare, and
you would usually see the damage as
blackened fused components. If this is
the case then you need professional
help.
Chip Testing
If the computer is just behaving oddly

then you need to ascertain which chip
is causing the trouble. A lack of screen
display usually means that the video
output circuitry has blown, as this
involves a lot of discrete components.
You will also need professional help
for this. The chip can be tested by
plugging it into a friend's C64 to see if
the same problem re-occurs.
This technique o f  using another
C64 to test chips is relatively safe. but
be careful not to force chips or bend
pins. Make sure you earth your hands
by touching something metal before
handling any components.
If your video circuitry is OK then
any other problem w ill generate a
screen display from which you may be
able to diagnose a fault.
Junk on the screen with a regular
pattern and an underlying picture of
the correct display indicates a RAM
problem. Professional service again
I'm afraid.
Abs olute s ile n c e o b v io u s ly
indicates a  dead sound chip. T he
sound circuitry is very robust, and it is
usually the chip that is the ﬁrst to go.
If the ROMs fail, then you will be
left with a blank screen. Although this
is very unlikely as these are amongst
MA IN T E N A N C E
the most reliable chips in the machine.
A dead processor will also exhibit
symptoms similar to this.
The remaining main chips are the
I/0 6569 type. There are two types of
these, UI handles the keyboards and
joysticks. Junk being typed out on the
screen as soon as you turn it on, or a
dead keyboard, indicates either a fault
with this chip or its support circuitry.
Alternatively, older  machines may
have their  keyboards full o f  dust.
Cleaning will solve the problem.
The other chip. U2, handles most
of the main I/0 with the user port and
series I/O.
The problem here is  that i t  is
difﬁcult t o  distinguish whether the
fault lies with the chip at U2 or the
device currently in use e.g. the disk
drive.
Summing Up
If you follow these simple tips you may
be able to rectify a small fault yourself,
or at least have some idea of what has
malfunctioned.
If the fault is more complex, you
need to ﬁnd a good repair shop. In this

These programs have sold thousands of
copies, and yet you won't have seen them
in the charts — why?
We produce programs that you can really
get y o u r te e th  in t o .  P ro g ra ms lik e
BUSICCALC and BUSICALC 3  which
can be used at home or in the ofﬁce to do
all sorts of calculations, forecasts and
budgets.
Programs like MIKRO ASSEMBLER and
the ZOOM monitor which make it easy to
write machine code programs. Programs
like MUS IC MASTER which turn yo u r
computer into a musical instrument. And
programs like the BLITZ compiler which
makes ordinary BASIC programs ru n
much, much faster.
We h a ve  been writ in g  programs f o r
Commodore computers since 1978 and
now have hundreds of programs for the
PET, VIC 20, CBM 64, CBM 128, even the
C16 a n d  Plus/4. S o  w h y  aren't o u r
programs in the charts?
Because our programs aren't one minute
wonders, here today and gone tomorrow.
Programs we released for the 64 in 1983
are still selling — and even more impor-
tant, the people who bought them then
are still using them.
Software should be an investment, not
money down the drain. We believe that
the more you put into a  program, the
more you should get out of it, and that's
the wa y it  wo rks with  software fro m
SUPERSOFT.
The programs listed on the right represent
a small selection from our range, but you
can get a full list if you phone or write to
the address below. We offer an excellent
mail order service, and you can pay by
cheque. Access, or Visa.
