How can we define health? Ever tried to take a stab at it? I attempt to define 
“fitness” and “geek” here because they appear in the title. But it seems health 
is a mélange of a lot of things—genes, lifestyle, a feeling of being safe and 
in charge—not all of which we can put a finger on. 
We tend to grope around in defining good nutrition and health. We can 
be too reductionist in our view of who’s healthy or whether we are healthy, 
claiming that “nutrition is 90 percent of health,” or that we have achieved 
some perfect biomarker like total cholesterol after six tests at the doctor’s 
office, so therefore we must be healthy. Or maybe we find out our telomeres 
are resilient and hanging in there, or we take a long survey on the Web, and 
the results pat us on the back and suggest we’ll live to be one hundred. 
Many of these things seem like feel-good, almost delusional exercises. So 
much about health is mysterious, yet to be discovered, and may never be 
discovered. I like that aspect of it, because it leads to more experimentation. 
Maybe your own ideas about how to stay healthy haven’t been refuted yet.
This doesn’t mean that you can’t aim for health, particularly if your current 
strategy has you waking up in the morning most days feeling pretty good. 
That’s where my “fitness” and “geek” definitions come in.
This is a book about fitness and nutrition for the independent of spirit 
and irrepressibly curious. The reason I have cleaved “nutrition” off from 
the general rubric of fitness is that, even though eating well (and the 
book will try to define that too) is part of being fit, we usually think of 
“fitness” as being an aspect of physical culture. 
Fitness implies an underlying assumption of physical health. The 
Oxford American Dictionary defines fitness as “the condition of being 
physically fit and healthy.” This book will discuss fitness in respect to 
becoming a physically stronger person and aging as well as we can. It 
will not advocate achieving a level of fitness, say, for a particular sport 
that undermines health in the process, which can actually be pretty 
common among all our popular extreme sports. 
Preface

METs Anyone?
Preface
xii
Mea culpa: I’ve done a few things in my life that some might consider 
extreme—like a five-hour–plus triathlon and a little mountaineering, mostly 
guided—but I would not claim that I was pursuing fitness during these 
adventures (I was fashioning unforgettable memories, and sometimes rais-
ing money for charity), and therein lies the difference. Since a good part of 
this book is about the latest and greatest gear that people are using for self 
tracking, speaking of extreme, I must pay homage here to the wonderful 
GoPro HD Hero helmet cams, which are tracking devices in their own right 
and have captured simply amazing outdoor videos for YouTube, such as that 
of a skier in the Alps being buried and dug out of an avalanche, and another 
skier launching off a cliff, unfurling a parachute, then watching an avalanche 
crash off the cliff behind him. Now that’s personal tracking.
METs Anyone?
I will attempt to define fitness in terms of energy output—this book men-
tions metabolic equivalent of task, or MET, a number of times. This is a simple 
numerical index of the energy a person outputs during the day. So, fitness 
is the ability to not only have the requisite energy to get through your daily 
tasks, but to be intermittently capable of a high-intensity energy effort: a 
higher than typical MET, like lifting a heavy weight, jumping high, or running 
fast, relative to your age and circumstances. 
We might even aspire to a more brass-tacks definition of fitness, which also 
comes from Oxford-American: the biological angle, “an organism’s ability to 
survive and reproduce in a particular environment.” You want to aspire to a 
level of fitness that allows you to thrive in your environment and be reason-
ably free of serious chronic illness. In this book’s discussions of food, exercise, 
sleep, rest, meditation, hormesis, and other issues, I hope upon hope that 
readers can mine a few nuggets of information that help them “survive…in 
a particular environment.”
The Food Angle
I like Boston Marathon winner Jack Fultz’s “see food” diet—“see food and eat 
it” (see Chapter 7 for an interview with him)—for its simplicity. Eating in the 
modern world is anything but simple these days. The act of eating has been 
completely medicalized, and has become sociopolitically militant to boot. 
The vegans are hurling pies (nondairy, of course) at the meat eaters, the 
vegetarians are aiming online flames at the omnivores, and the raw foodists 
are, well, refusing to cook anything.

Preface

Annals of Experimentation
As you’ll see in the chapter synopsis coming up, I’ll provide a lot of detailed 
nutrition information, but it all comes down to “eat real food.” Avoid pro-
cessed junk and things we haven’t eaten for millions of years (OK, coffee 
might be one exception). Yes, especially in Chapter 1, I spend a fair amount 
of time with the ancestral-health meme, or paradigm, that has worked its 
way through Western culture and among science and nutrition circles dur-
ing the last few years. 
The Mashed-up Ancient Angle
Humans spent hundreds of thousands of years moving around a lot outside, 
sleeping fairly long hours by the solar clock, and eating lots of plants and 
animal foods—and we carry largely the same software code inside ourselves 
today (human genes) as humans did back then. The closest approxima-
tions to an ancient person now are contemporary hunter-gatherers like the 
Maasai or the Hadzabe in East Africa, and they tend not to get our diseases. 
Maybe a good part of fitness is simply getting back to our roots—not cor-
rupting our own internal software by immobilizing ourselves in chairs, in 
cars, or in front of screens, moving around under the sun (making vitamin 
D), taking the time to sleep, and eating real food. Maybe.
Ironically enough, this is also a book about the latest technology—apps 
and gear that uses Global Positioning Systems, 3D accelerometers, and data 
connections to your own web dashboards to track personal propulsion (in 
running shoes and ski boots, etc.), eating, rest, and sleep. So it’s a high-tech/
ancient roots mashup. I certainly hope the mashup appeals and people 
don’t find it cognitively dissonant.
Annals of Experimentation
OK, now that we kind of know what fitness is, what’s a geek?
The typical image of a geek in popular culture is the Spielbergian hero with 
Coke-bottle glasses who gets picked on at school, then becomes the town 
hero when he hacks the computers at the nearby nuclear plant that’s hav-
ing a meltdown. I tend to go for a broader definition, however. A geek is 
someone who spends a huge amount of time analyzing the fine points of 
whatever interests her, ad infinitum, to a level that no one around her can 
possibly understand. Her family members and friends are all flabbergasted 
and scratch their heads, until finally, with a shrug of their shoulders and a 
murmur of “fanatic…,” they return to quotidian concerns.
When a geek focuses on fitness, that interest often manifests itself as self-
experimentation. Geeks are inveterate, fearless experimenters. They want to 
plunge into demonstrations and proofs of conventional truths and, to this 
A geek is someone who

end, subject their bodies to experiments that make others squeamish, like 
long fasts, “hormetic” cold-river swims, guzzling pans full of leftover beet 
juice and admiring the red color of their pee afterward, or sometimes just 
going out to a beach or mountain and sprinting like wild people. 
They absolutely do not automatically accept the bland marching orders 
of some officially anointed expert, whether it be the company dietician, a 
health-network M.D. they’ve never seen before, or the acronym-denoted 
bureaucracy that is determined to lecture them about how to eat and exercise. 
The several people I’ve interviewed in the book—including two NFL pro 
football players, a mountaineering guide, a national expert on vitamin C, 
a scientist who tests the effects of fasting on mice and tumors, an MIT sci-
entist who studies our mTOR growth pathway, and a former Israeli soldier 
who studied the Spartans, Greeks, and Macedonians and made up a “war-
rior diet”—don’t necessarily fit any kind of cultural cross-section, but I think 
they’re all fitness geeks in their own right.
I know I’ve always been a fitness geek. I’ve kept a little text log of sleep, 
workouts, morning heart rate, and body composition since way before the 
Internet became popular. I’ve also been educated in English and American 
literature and software engineering, and have spent a fair amount of time 
as a software programming geek. I have found many parallels between 
software design and fitness geekdom, such as the whole concept of antipat-
terns, or learning how to do something by studying how not to do it first. 
These parallels are sprinkled throughout the book—as is a little code here 
and there, but you don’t have to be that kind of geek to enjoy the reading.
The “Measure First” Mantra
The final point I’ll make about fitness geeks is that measuring, whether it be 
with the Fitbit, Zeo, Endomondo, their own software, or a simple text file, is 
a big part of a fitness geek’s obsession (healthy obsession, I’d say). The other 
day, we got a mailing from the electric utility describing our home’s energy 
usage and comparing it to that of our neighbors. We’re usually right in the 
middle, leaning toward the most efficient and not the most gluttonous, 
but this time we had used way too much energy. I handed my 15-year-old 
daughter the graph of our energy usage and the local comparisons—“Here, 
you might find this interesting.” 
Lo and behold, I started to find yellow sticky notes all over the house, at 
outlets and on appliances, containing tips on how we can reduce our elec-
tricity use. Cool! The old cliché is, “What gets measured gets managed.” The 
same is true with measuring health and fitness—the biofeedback makes a 
big difference.

How to Use This Book
How to Use This Book
This is a book that you can read from cover to cover, but you don’t have to 
approach it linearly. You can bop in and out of it—“Hey, today I’m going to 
read something about macronutrients or fasting.” Each chapter definitely 
stands on its own, so happy sampling.
This isn’t a book that prescribes exactly how to eat and exercise. “If you do 
A, B, C, and  D, you will be healthy—trust me.” So many of those books come 
and go. I admire the determination and temerity of their authors to find the 
one pathway to Elysium. This book is, however, chock-full of ideas—mostly 
not mine originally, but certainly tested by me—of ways that you can tinker 
with your lifestyle and body and move into a different, healthy direction. I 
do appeal to some general paradigms, though, which I’ve mentioned—to 
eat real food, move around a lot, sleep copiously (things you’ve heard of 
before)—and I look at a lot of different tools that geeks have invented to 
help you measure and share your progress. 
I suppose the pursuit of optimal fitness for yourself is a lofty goal, and it’s the 
path you take to get there that provides all the fun, stimulation, and grati-
fication. In terms of pursuing personal, optimal health, it’s not selfish—let’s 
shake that monkey off our backs. It’s the fit person who has the energy and 
availability to be charitable, help others, and give more of herself. 
Chapter 1: Fitness and the Human Codebase: Reboot Your Operating System
Too many of us are living in chairs (including the front seat of your 
Honda Civic or Ford Explorer), eating processed fake stuff on the run, 
and eschewing sleep for cable TV and social media. Isn’t our internal 
software designed for something—Monty Python enter here—com-
pletely different? Isn’t there a way we can live in the modern digital 
world and still feel physically vibrant? We look at cultivating respect 
for and seeking the wisdom of the ancients, as well as the evidence for 
rebooting our installed code and thus reacquainting ourselves with real 
food, sleep, and the great outdoors.
Chapter 2: Fitness Apps and Tools
There’s a lot of gear now that’s designed to promote fitness, as well as 
for just plain time-wasting fun. Self-tracking is a bona fide movement 
among humans. Want to track your exercise (even weightlifting), analyze 
your chow, and view your sleep graphs for the week? There are apps and 
widgets for that, and more. We look at stuff like the Fitbit, Endomondo, 
Fitocracy, Alpine Replay, Garmin Connect, Google Earth mashups, and 
nutritiondata.com, among others (Zeo is covered in Chapter 9).
In terms of pursuing personal, 
optimal health, it’s not selfish—

backs. It’s the fit person who has

Chapter 3: Macronutrients
This is the first of two heavyweight chapters on nutrition before we turn 
to the “kicking up your heels” part of existence later in the book. We 
explore everything you always wanted to know about carbs, fats, and 
proteins, and then some stuff you probably didn’t, like Rabbit Starvation 
Syndrome (the joy of living on seal fat) and the effect of fructose on your liver.
Chapter 4: Micronutrients
This chapter looks at everything you always wanted to know about 
vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, including some stuff that might 
have slipped past the school nurse during those vitamin lectures, such 
as “antinutrients” and what spinach might be doing to your mineral 
absorption, and the sorrows of vitamin deficiencies (and how easy it is 
to avoid them). 
Chapter 5: Food Hacks: Finding and Choosing Food
Shouldn’t you just see food and eat it? Yeah, I suppose if you were 
wandering through a dystopian-blasted landscape with Terminators in 
pursuit, but these days we can be a little more nuanced about choosing 
food. As in, do your wandering through weekly farmer’s markets, find 
out what a CSA is, and get to know your local farmer (get to know him 
really well). This chapter also offers with some ideas for dealing with food 
shortages, price increases, and food deserts.
Chapter 6: Food Timing: When to Eat, When to Fast
This chapter also has a nutritional bend, but from a different angle—not 
eating for intermittent periods and the health benefits of fasting. We talk 
to a scientist that studies the metabolic effects of fasts, and we discuss 
numerous variations of fasting protocols and some of the stuff that hap-
pens with your body during fasting. We also interview the inventor of 
the “warrior diet,” which can involve eating for only four hours per day. 
Hey, the Spartans did it.
Chapter 7: The Other World: A.K.A. Outside
This chapter looks at the absolute joy and necessity of being outside 
(we’re programmed for it), from the point of view of walking, sprinting, 
hiking, body-weight exercises, running, and skiing. You learn how to 
do Tabata sprints, a pull-up, and your own resistance-exercise regimen 
on a remote beach. We talk to a former Boston Marathon winner and 
a mountaineer. We bring in some of our favorite tools: Endomondo, 
Google Earth, and Alpine Replay. And hey, I’ll bet you never knew what 
friluftsliv was!

Chapter 8: Hello Gym! Navigating the Fitness Facility
You decide you gotta join the gym and get strong. Now what? We give 
you a rundown on the basics of resistance exercise in the gym (yeah, we 
figure you get the most bang for your buck by aiming to add and retain 
lean mass). The chapter talks about sets, reps, volume, and “repetition 
max,” then it jumps into descriptions of about 15 different techniques, 
including photos and links. We talk to two NFL pro football players 
about the not-so-casual aspects of getting strong enough to withstand 
a profession as modern gladiator.
Chapter 9: Randomizing Fitness and the Importance of R & R
Ever written a random( ) method or function in your code? Did you 
know that randomizing fitness, as in letting an algorithm choose a ran-
dom exercise for you, might be good for you? We propose a couple of 
ways that you could do that (the CrossFit world has a “workout of the 
day” tradition), including the gainfitness.com tool. We also discuss an 
online tool for determining if an athlete is rested and ready to go, called 
RestWise. Last, but not least, is the all-important topic of sleep—and this 
is where you get a look at a nice piece of gear for the power sleepers of 
the analytic set: the Zeo Sleep Manager.
Chapter 10: Code Maintenance: Human Fueling and Supplements
Once you start going crazy on bumping up your outdoor and indoor 
activities, you have to start paying even more attention to nutrition. 
You suddenly start eating to get stronger and/or faster, not just because 
you’re hungry. This chapter discusses some of the nuances, such as eat-
ing more of everything to add muscle, the magic hour after exercise for 
chowing, as well as a few supplements you might consider based on 
the science literature. We interview an MIT scientist about the mTOR 
pathway, which is the core biochemical sequence, buried just about 
everywhere in your body, that controls growth of both good (muscle) 
and bad (tumor) stuff. That’s right, it’s anabolic.
Chapter 11: Lifestyle Hacks for Fitness
There are so many different potential ways that you can hack fitness (and 
at least delight in the experimentation, even if they don’t really work). 
This chapter discusses a few of them that probably do work, many fall-
ing under the rubric of hormesis, or good stress. Try cold-water swims, 
saunas, a nice glass of vintage grape (but not three), plus high-intensity 
exercise (also hormesis). “The world breaks everyone,” Hemingway 
wrote in A Farewell To Arms, “and afterward many are strong at the broken 
places.”

Acknowledgments
I always wanted to write a whole book about fitness, even before I became 
a geek (wait, I guess I always was a geek, they just didn’t have a word for it 
yet—curious dork?). I absolutely never would have published this book, how-
ever, without the help of numerous other people. 
I’ll start with my family. My parents, Anne and Robert Perry, brought me up 
in Concord, Massachusetts (back then a land of rebels, geeks, writers, and 
readers), and constantly made sure that either I had a book in front of me 
or I was running around playing outside. No matter how hard he’d worked 
that day, my dad always took me outside to throw baseballs at him (note the 
suggestion of inaccuracy). Thereby a “fitness geek” was born. I’m grateful for 
everything they have done for me.
Stacy LeBaron, my wife, constantly lends her encouragement, not to men-
tion indefatigable assistance, along with our two dear, fit children, Rachel 
(black belt in martial arts) and Scott (slick downhill skier in Vermont). It’s 
tough to carve out time to write a book, and these guys are constantly cov-
ering for me so I can escape to the Vermont woods to write, not to mention 
inspiring new ideas with their feedback.
I’m grateful to all the busy scientists, researchers, professors, athletes, inven-
tors, and all-around fitness geeks who took the time out of busy schedules 
to answer my questions, after I had “cold emailed” them out of the blue. This 
would have been a far lesser book without their input.
I thank my editor Brian Sawyer, who shepherded the book along from the 
beginning, as well as the rest of the O’Reilly team and Bob Watson, Lindsay 
Peterson, and Meghan Johnson, the tech reviewers, whose feedback and 
perspicacious efforts have made this a better book. 
I’d also like to acknowledge you, the reader, and your pursuit of health for 
health’s sake, which ends up benefitting everyone, not just yourself. Keep 
experimenting!

You get up in the morning with the shades yanked down, after having col-
lapsed under the covers at some indeterminate time past midnight (which 
followed several robotic hours of Facebook typing). Luckily, you’d set the 
coffee maker on a timer, so a quart of strong joe waits on the kitchen coun-
ter. Twelve ounces of that washes down a toasted bagel smeared with extra 
margarine and jelly, as you’re out the door on the way to a 45-minute car 
commute. 
It’s just the beginning of a marathon bout of sitting.
The Cubicle Blues
Sound familiar? When you get to work it’s an elevator ride off to the cubicle, 
where you refill the to-go coffee mug with joe that already tastes old, and 
someone’s left an open box of donuts in convenient proximity. You write 
code until you’re cross-eyed, interspersed with two meetings where you sit 
on your behind listening to two marketing/admin guys who love to hear 
themselves pontificate. 
At lunchtime, you take the elevator downstairs and walk half a block to 
Subway, where you buy a “healthy” tuna n’ cheese sub, which is almost the 
size of the baseball bat you used in Little League. Half of it is munched down 
before you get back to your cubicle and that C++ module you were sup-
posed to finish by 5:30, which rolls around with an amazing sense of time 
squashed into a smaller space than you ever needed it to be. 
A few times during the day, you join the crowd congregating in front 
of the vending machines (to which an entire work enclave has been 
devoted). The temptation to push a couple of buttons on this amazing 
invention and get something—chips (many varieties), a Pop-Tart, crack-
ers and tuna salad (yup, they have those in vending machines)—is 
overwhelming. The lively sounds of conversation are interspersed 
with the ripping noise of little bags being opened.

Movement, We Hardly Knew Ye
You wanted to exercise, but… it’s back to the car commute and “dinner” 
(consisting of a Diet Pepsi and the rest of the sub while driving), when it 
dawns on you that you could not tell someone whether you actually walked 
in or physically sensed any sunlight that day. You get home, slump down 
onto a couch in the familiar sitting position, and, well, you feel like the 
bloody indefinable thing your big old cat, Hooch, who now eyes you with an 
inscrutable neutrality, dragged home that day.
Ditto the next day.
Free-Falling
What’s wrong with this picture? Okay, so the implications of this narrative are 
pretty obvious. Hope I didn’t lay it on too thick. You probably spent most of 
the day as a “chair liver.”
The food you ate was “bad for you” (or simply not particularly good), and you 
didn’t take any opportunities to move your limbs around, beyond pumping 
your fist in the air during an online glimpse of ESPN SportsCenter. You failed 
to stand up or walk for a reasonable period of time. The sun, bestowing life 
on earth, has become a stranger.
It’s not your fault, you argue silently, with at least a little credibility. The work/
commute schedule is crazy. You’re lucky enough to have any job that pays 
pretty well.
Homing In on a Design Pattern 
The messages your body undoubtedly sends you, however, roughly translat-
ed as I feel like crap, probably indicate that you’re not really designed to live 
this way. In fact, a bunch of scientists, fitness experts, philosophers, econo-
mists, anthropologists, medical doctors, and overall outside-the-box think-
ers have come up with the sensible hypothesis that we are designed for our 
ancestors’ way of living, which was very different from the latter narrative.
We were not born to be chair livers, eating factory fare and keeping sleep 
hours like a vampire (unless we’re in college, that is). Chapters 3, 4, 7, 8, and 
9 will fill in just about all you need to know about eating right, kicking up 
your heels, and getting some rest. We need to find another design pattern.

Design Patterns for Code and Fitness
Men and women who write code for a living usually know 
something about design patterns. Design patterns are 
reusable strategies for solving common problems or tasks. 
The programming world borrowed this concept of design 
patterns from architecture—you have design strategies for 
buildings that always work, so why not reuse them instead 
of reinventing the wheel?
An example of a design pattern in object-oriented program-
ming (OOP) is the Object Factory. OOP is a way of designing 
software based on the real world. If you have a website, 
and people join it as members, you might code a “Member” 
object so that you can separate that unit of Member code and 
have it only deal with aspects of memberships. 
But you constantly need to create new Members in your 
code, because your website is so popular. So, the Object 
Factory is a piece of code whose sole purpose is to create 
new distinct Members. Every time your code needs to create 
a new Member (and store it in a database), it calls the Object 
Factory’s getNewMember( ) method or operation. Problem 
solved.
Your fitness can also be based on a common design pat-
tern—get sunlight, movement, natural food, sleep, affec-
tion, love—which we derive from our very deep past. Much 
of our behavior can spin off this “human design pattern.”

I tend to agree with the meme, or paradigm, that has made its way about the 
Web and even among the scientific journals (call it “paleo,” ancestral health, 
the return to Eden, or whatever you want to) that we were born to move 
around in sunlight, eat real food, and sleep much more than our friends want 
us to (you know, the ones who are knocking on the door right now and try-
ing to get you to go to that party).
As a geek, think of our situation this way. We’re all born with preinstalled 
software, our human codebase. The genome. You know, the curlicues of 
DNA in our chromosomes inside the nuclei of most cells: all that ATGC code 
that defines what we are biologically. It is kind of cool, almost mesmerizing, 
how Mother Nature seems to have her own software language. Perhaps 
we’ve subconsciously invented computer programs that have the look and 
feel of our own internal code. 
See this page at 23andMe for a nice refresher or primer on genes and 
genetics: www.23andme.com/gen101/genes/.
It took hundreds of thousands of years to write this software. The evolution-
ary process is very slow, meaning we haven’t changed very much in thou-
sands of years. We’re all separated by tiny changes in our genes, such as the 
fact that some people can’t digest lactose that well and others eat asparagus 
and sense a different smell in their pee (really). 
“The spontaneous mutation rate for nuclear DNA is estimated at 0.5% 
per million years. Therefore, over the past 10,000 years there has been 
time for very little change in our genes, perhaps 0.005%,” comments 
Artemis P. Simopoulos, M.D., of The Center for Genetics, Nutrition and 
Health, Washington, DC, USA, in a journal article from 2008.1

The Pre–Convenience Store Era
Our ancestors, with basically our genome, ate dead meat (as in, scavenged), 
wild meat that they hunted, stuff that grew, tree nuts, whatever lake or sea 
foods they could grab, and gobs of raw honey produced by swarms of bees 
made docile by the smoky fires lit beneath their nests. 
Some of the time, as the weather was changing crazily around them (sound 
familiar?), they couldn’t find any food, for days—for weeks.
Whatever, essentially, our earliest forebears could eat to remain alive, they 
did eat. It all had to be hunted and wild; they didn’t have bodegas or conve-
nience stores back then. They had to move to the food (no pizza deliveries 
or fancy caterers), and often had to chase and subdue it, if not fend off other 
predators who sought to reclaim their carcasses. They were outside a good 
chunk of the time during daylight hours.
We’re so close to these ancient forebears biochemically that molecular 
biologists have hypothesized a link from each of us to an ultimate Mom, a 
primordial Eve (see the sidebar, “The Ultimate Super Mom”).
Imagine that you’re standing next to your grandmother in a long line. She is 
standing next to her mother, and then your grandmother’s grandmother is 
the next Mom in line after that, and the string of people extends for “10,000 
grandmothers,” as the author Brian Fagan puts it in his book Cro-Magnon: 
How the Ice Age Gave Birth to the First Modern Humans. The 10,000th grand-
mother might be the ultimate Mom that all humans are related to.
The Ultimate Super Mom: Mitochondrial or African Eve
Our genetic ancestors are tens of thousands of years old, 
and we still carry their primeval DNA in our genome. For 
example, genetic scientists have created deep “family trees” 
that are designed to trace every person in the world down 
the line through all the mothers and grandmas to the same 
woman, a kind of “super Mom” who lived roughly 150,000 
years ago in East Africa. 
She’s called “Mitochondrial Eve” because the mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) is where the genetic connection between 
ourselves and a grandmother who theoretically existed 
10,000 generations ago resides.
The mitochondria are organelles within most cells, little 
engines that generate much of our cellular energy. They 
are the places, other than the cell nuclei (where most DNA 
is located), that also contain our genetic blueprint. A major 
difference between the gene copy in the mitochondria and 
the copy in the nucleus of a cell is that mitochondrial DNA 
is inherited only from the mother—it isn’t mingled together 
with the father’s DNA.
This allows scientists to focus their analysis of genes from 
mother to mother as far back as they can.
The work of these molecular biologists and other scientists 
is a reflection of how tightly interrelated we are as humans, 
as well as of how close our own genes are to those of 
prehistoric people. “The African Eve is a fictional person, a 
product of molecular biology, which has used mitochondri-
al DNA to show that all of us, wherever we live, are ultimate-
ly of African descent,” writes Brian Fagan in Cro-Magnon: 
How the Ice Age Gave Birth to the First Modern Humans.

Ancestors
The human genome goes back at least as far as about 2.5 million years, 
when the Lower Paleolithic era began (otherwise known as the early Stone 
Age). Actually you could trace our genes back quite a bit further, but for the 
sake of brevity we’ll start with an upright ancestor that used tools 2.5 million 
years in the past called homo habilis. 
He was followed by homo erectus, who trekked around his wild habitat (and 
often booked out of there as fast as he could) around one million years ago, 
and homo sapiens about half a million years ago. The most advanced and 
successful ancestor who wandered out of our original African habitat and 
established herself in Europe was Cro-Magnon, who thrived in that region 
beginning about 50,000 years ago. We’re quite similar, anatomically and 
genetically, to these guys and gals.2
Few would disagree that a modern hunter-gatherer, or even a Cro-
Magnon, is living or lived closer to our built-in design than most of us 
cubicle cronies!
Five Seconds to Midnight
The typical way to express the idea of us carrying the preinstalled software 
of those prehistoric guys and gals is that if those millions of years of human 
evolution could be compressed into a 24-hour clock, the last 10,000 years 
since the Agricultural Revolution would take place beginning at about five 
minutes to midnight.
The last 200 years of the Industrial Revolution began to take place at about 
five seconds to midnight. And the Digital Age… well, you get the metaphor. 
It’s been an eye blink, and evolution is not fast enough to redesign us for 
endless couch surfing!
Designed to Get Our Butts Kicked
It’s safe to say that the hunter-gatherers and us moderns are pretty similar in 
our genetic programming. 
“Shallow” genetic changes that can dig in their heels faster are taking place 
all the time, according to Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending’s book 
The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution. 
These are variations on our genome; see the sidebar “Night of the Mampires: 
How Genes Can Affect the Way We Handle Food.”
About 99 percent of our genetic history, however, has been spent interact-
ing with our environment more like a Maasai tribeswoman, a Plains Indian, 
or a modern lady getting her butt kicked during an Outward Bound course, 
rather than the characters depicted in the TV show Men of a Certain Age.

This has something to do with those eighteenth- to nineteenth-century 
Plains Indians being the buffest bad-asses in the world during their time.3 
They were hunters who acted like hunter-gatherers and killed, ate, made 
stuff out of, and revered the American bison.
Here’s another evolution-related example, partly from Chapter 4 on micro-
nutrients. We can’t biosynthesize or make our own vitamin C or vitamin E, 
as plants can (although we can biosynthesize vitamin D, from the sun). We 
therefore evolved to get vital micronutrients like vitamins from those pho-
tosynthesizing plants, as well as farther up the food chain, from the animals 
that munched the veggies. It’s part of our design; we eat plants and animals 
because, in turn, we need the C and E vitamins to keep our internal machin-
ery going. 
To reach the plants and animals, guess what, we had to be moving around 
in a cyclical pattern of hunt-gather-rest, then do-it-again. We are bipedal 
people, ambulatory by nature. Whether or not at any moment we could 
have been ripped asunder and devoured by wild beasts or stomped to 
death by the underestimated prehistoric bison (you can’t really sugarcoat 
that Paleolithic life, pun intended), this scenario still represents the diet and 
locomotive patterns that our ancestors, and we ourselves, were and have 
evolved for.
Night of the Mampires: How Genes Can Affect the Way We Handle Food
Although people most likely have not developed complex 
genetic adaptations to a diet dominated by sugar, wheat 
flour, and vegetable oils, we do display code differences in 
our ability to handle some foods.
Many of us are mampires: we can consume and digest the 
milk from other animals. 
Lactase is an enzyme that is necessary for digesting milk. 
According to the book The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civili-
zation Accelerated Human Evolution:
The most dramatic examples are mutations that 
allow adults to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk. 
Hunter-gatherers, and mammals in general, stop 
making lactase (the enzyme that digests lactose) in 
childhood… But after the domestication of cattle, 
milk was available and potentially valuable to peo-
ple of all ages, if only they could digest it. A mutation 
that caused continued production of lactase origi-
nated some 8,000 years ago and has spread widely 
among Europeans, reaching frequencies of over 95 
percent in Denmark and Sweden.4
Humans also differ in their tolerance for salt in the diet,  
according to the book:
There is a gene whose ancestral form helps people to 
conserve salt. Since humans spent most of their his-
tory in hot climates, this variant was generally use-
ful. A high frequency of this ancestral allele among 
African Americans probably plays a role in their 
increased risk of high blood pressure today. In tropi-
cal Africa, in fact, almost everyone has the ancestral 
version of the gene. In Eurasia, a null variant (one 
that does nothing at all) becomes more and more 
common as one moves north.5
So the genetic difference helps people to conserve salt in 
their bodies in hot climates, but it becomes a liability when 
you eat a lot of salt in processed foods.
Finally, the book points to evidence that some people 
are metabolically protected against certain blood-sugar 
problems:
“Researchers in Iceland have found that new variants of a 
gene regulating blood sugar protect against diabetes.”6  The 
upshot is that we’re not exact replicas of hunter-gatherers; 
we’re just very close to them.

The Cranky Anthropologist
The Cranky Anthropologist
Is it possible to live in a way that completely undermines your own soft-
ware configuration? Are we corrupting our own code? Well, yeah, I guess 
that’s where I’m leading, based on the aforementioned hypothesis of our 
closeness in design to our ancient forebears. Scientists call it evolutionary 
discordance.
The anthropologist Jared Diamond fumed in a famous essay from more than 
20 years ago that the move to agriculture 10,000 years ago was “the worst 
mistake in the history of the human race” (Discovery Magazine, May 1987) 
and “a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.” 
Diamond emphasized the rigid class-based systems and “gross social and 
sexual inequalities, the disease and despotism” that agricultural systems 
have bred, but there were other physical and health-related downsides as 
well, which persist in a different nature all the way up to modern times. 
Don’t get the wrong impression from my knocks against the Ag 
Revolution—I love farms, particularly of the small and local variety. I 
just returned from one, with a juicy bag of salad materials, Macintosh 
apples, and blueberries. The point of this passage is that the transition 
from hunter-gatherer to the diet of agriculturalists had bad health 
consequences that are relevant today (i.e., we’re still bedeviled by a 
high-quantity, low-nutrition diet).
See the sidebar “A Tale of Hoe” for what the effect of the agricultural transi-
tion was on height and health in general.
A Tale of Hoe: Protein and Thus Height “Tanked”
“[Agriculture] vastly increased food production, but the nutritional quality of the food was 
worse than it had been among hunter-gatherers,” according to The 10,000 Year Explosion: 
How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution.7
“Hunter-gatherers would rarely have suffered vitamin-deficiency diseases such as beri-
beri, pellagra, rickets, or scurvy, but farmers sometimes did… it looks as if the carbohy-
drate fraction of their diet almost tripled, while the amount of protein tanked.”8
Height crashed in response to this “quantity not quality diet,” as did the robustness of 
the skeletons that paleoanthropologists have studied. The average Cro-Magnon male 
was between 5’ 9” (176 centimeters) and 5’ 10”; they were built athletically to boot.
“You can see the mismatch between the genes and the environment in the skeletal 
evidence. Humans who adopted agriculture shrank: Average height dropped by almost 
five inches.”9

Hey, the Stone Age Was a Nasty Time

Hey, the Stone Age Was a Nasty Time
The oft-stated disclaimer is that all this hunter-gatherer talk is baloney: 
human longevity has never been greater than it is now, and even inside 
bustling, youth-oriented places like Manhattan, you can find many cente-
narians. In contrast, the lives of our Paleolithic ancestors were “nasty, brut-
ish, and short,” maybe averaging a third or less the length of one of those 
centenarians’. 
A big problem with that argument, as a number of essayists have pointed 
out, is the concept of using an “average lifespan” to describe the health of a 
population of people. 
As Jeff Leach pointed out in an October 2010 letter titled “Paleo Longevity 
Redux” in Public Health Nutrition: 
The first problem with this thinking is the “average life span” math is 
misleading and tells us very little about the health and longevity of 
an individual, but rather gives us an average age of death for a given 
group or population. For example, a couple that lived to the ages of 
76 and 71, but had one child that died at birth and another at age 
two ([76+ 71 + 0 + 2] / 4), would produce an average life span of 
37.25. Using this methodology it is easy to see how one would come 
to the conclusion that this group was not very healthy.
Along the same lines, the author of The Black Swan, Taleb Nassim, pointed 
out in an essay called “Why I Walk”: 
The argument often heard about primitive people living on average 
less than 30 years ignores distribution around such average—life 
expectancy needs to be analyzed conditionally. Plenty died early, 
from injuries, many lived very long—and healthy—lives. This is 
exactly the very same elementary “fooled by randomness” mistake, 
relying on the notion of “average” in the presence of variance, that 
makes people underestimate the risks in the stock market.
Undoubtedly, some of those ancient lives were “nasty, brutish, and short,” 
and inherently violent, without antibiotics, modern medicine in general, and 
a local police department. 
In a way, the claims about brief Paleolithic lives are a red herring: the few 
remaining modern hunter-gatherers tend to go through their lives with only 
rare occurrences of the contemporary “diseases of Western civilization.”

The Modern Diet—It’s Lame!
Jeff Leach concludes his essay:
The self-confidence that comforts us today as we review the average 
life span of our ancestors is misguided and tenuous when viewed 
through the captivating haze of modern medicine that literally 
props most of us up into our golden years. I doubt our ancestors 
would call this living. While we may live longer than our ancestors, 
we are in fact dying slower.
The Modern Diet—It’s Lame!
Note the “mismatch between genes and the environment” point in the “Tale 
of Hoe” sidebar. Things are at least as bad now in modern society as they 
were during the dawn of the agricultural age (at least those early farmers 
spent a lot of time outside doing hard-scrabble chores in sunlit gardens).
The World Health Organization estimates that lifestyle-oriented diseases will 
cost the global economy $30 trillion over the next 20 years (that includes 
smoking and alcohol abuse, as well as chowing down sugary and salt-laden 
snack foods).10
What’s going on here—why do we have such a massive health crisis? Don’t 
our experts have an incredibly deep and nuanced knowledge about how 
health and the body function? We’ve sequenced the human genome. We’re 
even working on “nutrigenomics,” or specifically tailoring nutrition and 
supplements to a person’s genes. 
I guess health isn’t exclusively about science, medical practices, or conven-
tional public-health recommendations, or we’d be able to apply that knowl-
edge about how to stay healthy with greater success than we do. Couldn’t 
we do a better job of embracing a new design pattern, one based on our 
own inherited operating systems?
Evolutionary Discordance: It’s SAD
In a 2005 article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the medical doc-
tor Boyd Eaton and his colleagues pointed out how lame the diet many of 
us depend on—which is commonly lampooned as the Standard American 
Diet (SAD)—is:11
Although dairy products, cereals, refined sugars, refined vegetable 
oils, and alcohol make up 72.1% of the total daily energy consumed 
by all people in the United States, these types of foods would have 
contributed little or none of the energy in the typical preagricultural 
hominin diet. 
In a word, ouch!
Couldn’t we do a better job  
of embracing a new design 
pattern, one based on our own 
inherited operating systems?

The Modern Diet—It’s Lame!
Chapter 1
10
Boyd Eaton also pointed out in a recent speech that “50 percent of our 
ancestor’s diet was fruits and vegetables; now for Americans it’s 13 percent, 
which represents a huge [decline]” in antioxidant intake (see the sidebar in 
Chapter 4 on those all-important antioxidants). “The skin of the fruit contains 
most of the antioxidants, and the smaller wilder fruits contain more anti-
oxidants,” given that you have to eat more fruit skin with the smaller, wilder 
varieties to fill up on fruit servings.
Taking this point to heart, I ate a lot of apples off an apple tree in 
Vermont this summer and early fall. The apples were smaller; I thus 
ate more skin and presumably antioxidants compared with larger, 
sweeter, store-bought apples. The apples were tarter off the tree, per-
haps containing less fructose (you should watch the fructose load in 
your diet—see Chapter 3 on macronutrients). And hey, I had to jump 
and climb to get the apples, which had to be more active than cruisin’ 
the checkout aisles!
Don’t Crash Your Own Software
Eaton and his colleagues have hypothesized, along with other researchers, 
that the “diseases of civilization,” like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and 
depression, could be caused by this evolutionary discordance in food intake. 
In addition, some studies have pointed to the lack of physical exercise as 
more evidence that we are badly out of sync with our built-in codebase. 
“Recent cultural changes have engineered physical activity out of the daily 
lives of humans,” pointed out Manu Chakravarthy and Frank W. Booth in the 
Journal of Applied Physiology in 2004:12 
As a result of the introduction of habitual physical inactivity into 
the pattern of daily living, the risks of at least 35 chronic health 
conditions have increased…we will speculate that the feast-famine 
cycling and physical activity-rest cycling that were related to food 
procurement for [hunter-gatherers] selected genes for an oscillating 
enzymatic regulation of food-storage and usage.
If physical activity is part of our design, why did we engineer it out 
of our lives? One answer is the pervasiveness of technology, which it 
turns out controls us, rather than the other way around. Screen life 
requires immobility in front of screens. In addition, we no longer have 
to “go get” vitamins to stay alive—they’re within an arm’s reach on 
the shelf or easily acquired without even leaving a sitting position in 
the car (although convenience foods often lack those very vitamins). 
Modern food is ubiquitous.
“As a result of the  
introduction of habitual  
physical inactivity into the  
pattern of daily living, the risks 
of at least 35 chronic health

A Useful Template
Ironically, our own built-in “man-page” (the software instructions for the Unix 
operating system) carries the imprint of our earliest low-tech ancestors, and 
provides many clues for maintaining fitness.
A Useful Template
Of course, most of us cannot dash out the back door and give the hunter-
gatherer life the old college try. 
Nor can I advocate that we all sprint out into the woods with scary face 
masks and beat drums, throw spears at shadows, and howl at the moon 
(although, now that I mention it, what a blast that would be). We can initiate 
a kind of mashup of modern and ancient life, though. Our preloaded soft-
ware represents a useful template with which we can assess our own daily 
choices. We know what we’re designed for; we read this book!
We’ve discussed nutrition a bit up to now; the rest of the book launches into 
the savory subjects of food, fitness, and exercise in quite a bit of detail. The 
movement angle of fitness is obviously very important, but to what degree? 
Chair Men of the Bored
Will Ferrell leans back in the movie Wedding Crashers and memorably cries 
out, “Hey Ma—the meatloaf—we want it now—the meatloaf!” He crystal-
lizes an evolving biological tribe we could call Homo barcalounger. 
We’ve become a species of sitters, as eloquently put by a doctor in a recent 
online issue of the Brooklyn Eagle: 13
We move from the chair in the car to the chair in front of the com-
puter in the office; then we go home in the chair in the car to the 
chair in front of a copious dinner to the chair in front of the TV. The 
next day the cycle repeats itself. We sit too much.
Believe it or not, scientists have coined a term for this trend: chair living. It has 
been a part of cubicle life for us geeks since the early epochs of the digital 
age, but many of us, along with others of the deskbound variety, have since 
altered our workstations to combine standing with computer work (check 
out the stand-up workstation called the GeekDesk at www.geekdesk.com). 
Chair living apparently takes sedentary living to a new level. 
If you’re like me, you probably think of sitting as an activity that is as com-
mon as, well, standing, and that might be bad for you if you did it for 25 years 
in a row. It’s much worse than that, apparently.
As James Levine, an M.D. at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, wrote in a 
November 10, 2010, journal article, “a growing body of evidence suggests 
that chair-living is lethal… linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic [prob-
lems], excess weight, and shorter life span.”14

The Amazin’ MET
Chapter 1
12
You can read that article and weep, then, consequently, leap out of your 
chair. Levine goes on: 
The human evolved over several million years to be bipedal and 
ambulatory. This time frame is consistent with the genetic and 
epigenetic design of the human physique and organ systems. 
Neuro-behaviorists would argue that the human brain and behav-
ior evolved in concert. The human evolved to competitively flourish 
while upright with respect to providing food (agriculture and hunt-
ing), shelter (home building), and tool design (e.g., flint knives). The 
human evolved to feed, shelter, and invent while ambulatory. The 
human, simply put, was not designed to sit all day.
The Amazin’ MET
A very useful measure of how much we are moving throughout the day 
is the metabolic equivalent of task (MET), or just metabolic equivalent. It’s 
a simple way to quantify our energy output, and it starkly underlines the 
differences between sitting and real movement. The MET is designed to 
represent the amount of energy in the form of heat we’re generating, using a 
numeric multiple. For example, reclining in a chair is 1 MET; sleeping is 0.8.15
This scale moves all the way up through walking about a mile per hour on 
the flat (1.9), actively raking leaves (2.9), light biking or golf (5.0), to running 
12-minute miles (8.5), to running faster than nine miles an hour (9.5).
We’re going to be returning to METs throughout this book, particularly in 
the tools and exercise chapters. For example, Chapter 2 discusses a nifty 
little gadget called the Fitbit that you can use to measure your average MET 
for a day. 
The bottom line is that you want to push up your MET for the day, because 
it’s what we’re designed for. We seem to be evolved for a steady oscillation 
of physical activity throughout the day, along with short bursts of intense, 
almost scary effort (yeah, exercise can be hormesis!—see Chapter 11).
Olden-days hunter-gatherers almost certainly had a higher average 
MET than our contemporaries.
Force Quit—Reboot
By now it should be obvious that we are built to eat Mother Nature’s food, 
such as wild (or wild-like) meat or fish, and multicolored plants that come 
from organic farms and leap from the pages of Mother Earth magazine. We’re 
supposed to boogie down, and we’re not designed for self-imposed muscu-
lar paralysis. You might even think that this chapter belabors these points, 
which would amount to a harangue if not for the fact that most of these 
negative trends are instantly reversible. 
The bottom line is that you 
want to push up your MET for 
the day, because it’s what we’re 
designed for.

And Now for Something Completely Different
I won’t include much in this chapter about the specifics of fitness-oriented 
exercise and training, because so much of the book (see Chapters 2, 7, and 
8) is crammed with various techniques for sprinting, resistance training, 
trekking (with or without weighted vests), and more for capturing all of your 
exercise data on a web page for various forms of analysis.
This chapter will conclude on an upward swing with the flip side of the “daily 
grind” we began with. It includes a couple of adjustments that bring it much 
closer to our installed software base—and our own pursuit of optimal fitness.
And Now for Something Completely Different
Try this: you wake up without an alarm sometime soon after sunrise, with 
plenty of time to spare to make it to work. 
It was a good sleep; you went to bed just after nine o’clock after having a 
snack consisting of coconut milk blended with blueberries and a little whey 
powder. You’re already savvy about getting enough REM sleep, but now you 
aim to bump up your deep sleep, or restorative NREM. You might even check 
out the wave chart your Zeo produced.
The first thing you do is pour a cup of black tea or coffee and go outside to 
this pool of sunlight you’ve noticed out your window. 
You bask and reflect in it for a minute, perhaps followed by a few Tai Chi 
moves, push-ups on the lawn, or pull-ups on the jungle gym across the 
street from your apartment. You sip a bit more coffee and return to your liv-
ing space to get ready for the commute.
Technically speaking, as you gazed up into the sky and basked in that sun, 
the light rays touched your retinas and were transduced by the hypothala-
mus and pineal gland in your brain, which has now helped set your circadian 
rhythms for the day.
Mindfulness
The sun you got wasn’t much, not like spending the morning on the beach 
in the British Virgin Islands (gotta do that someday…), but it had the effect of 
lightening your mood, clearing your head, and kick-starting the day. You’ve 
sent the message to your body and your brain, “It’s morning and I’m well 
rested and ready to go.” (See Chapter 9 for more info on the health impor-
tance of sleep and rest.)
Every other day you stop at an intervening fitness facility to lift a few weights 
or do a 300-yard swim interspersed with a handful of 25-yard sprints—noth-
ing too much, but today you’re biking to the train station, where they’ve 
thoughtfully included a place to lock your rig.

The train ride into the center of the city (Boston, New York, San Francisco, 
Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Montreal; Zurich, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, 
London, Sydney, Wellington, Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto…) takes 35 minutes, and 
you stand for most of it, just because it feels better. 
Geek Gear
You kind of want to rack up more activity points on this web-connected, 
motion-sensitive, stair-counting altitude calculator you’ve clipped onto 
your belt (yeah, it’s called a Fitbit), although gear isn’t strictly necessary this 
morning. It’s just fun, in a geeky kind of obsessive way. You like quantifying 
and logging your exercise. This act itself seems motivating. The web charts 
your gear generates later are actually quite impressive. They can show your 
oscillating movement throughout the day, and pinpoint the days when you 
need more.
Gathering data is not useless when you act upon it.
The tool for adding up your daily motion mileage works with an odd “tail 
wagging the dog” effect; you seem to move more when you’re wearing it. 
Further, you never really knew that ordinary movement could equate to that 
much mileage during the day. More than six miles sometimes, even though 
your walks were broken up into several smallish ones.
Plodding along on a treadmill just isn’t necessary anymore. You love looking 
at the stats at the end of the day. Just keep moving, you say to yourself. Seek 
the sun.
Hard-Boiled Eggs to Go
Breakfast today was two hard-boiled eggs (eggs bought the previous week-
end at a farmer’s market), a piece of Swiss cheese, a bite of salmon left over 
from last night, and two plums plus an avocado (also purchased at the mar-
ket). Yesterday, you fasted through breakfast, and that felt fine. Actually, the 
bit of coffee plus “intermittent fast” kept you pretty perky throughout the 
morning. (See Chapter 6 for more on intermittent fasting.)
You’ve got a little plastic bag in your backpack containing the rest of the 
salmon, a mixture of almonds and walnuts, an apple, and a square of 85% 
high-cacao chocolate. In a pinch, there’s a good salad place near work. It 
only took a couple of weeks not to miss that bagel anymore, and especially 
all that crappy margarine (you go for really yellow butter now)—the slug-
gishness and lack of satiety it seemed to leave you with, and the way it 
seemed to take half the morning to digest it and the donut and scone you 
piled on top of it. 
Hopping off the train, you walk about 30 minutes the rest of the way to work, 
on the sunny side of the street, even though you could have dipped into the 
subway or hopped on a bus. 
It's morning and I'm well-
rested and ready to go.

Dude, Take the Stairs
Work is on the third floor of a tall building, but you take the stairs, walking 
briskly past a line of people waiting at the elevator. Their auras are uniformly 
glum, as if someone else is pulling their strings. You have never taken the 
elevator, including that time your supervisors were standing in front of it 
with expectant looks, suggesting they had an axe to grind.
You take the stairs two at a time, simply because the heft in your upper leg 
feels good. Your heart rate gets going, but not that much; you’ve noticed 
that improvement over the months.
OCD About Health
The morning goes on and you switch between sitting and standing in 
your cubicle—standing most of the time. You have a pretty good stand-up 
workstation setup. Besides, the standing for hours bumps up those motion-
and-mileage numbers, which no one else could possibly care about, except 
other users fidgeting with their tracking devices and apps and going online 
afterward with the data. You don’t mind having an obsessive-compulsive 
disorder involving healthy habits. You also don’t mind going without your 
gear for a day or two. No big deal.
About every hour or 90 minutes during the day, you head down those stairs 
again and back outside into the sun. When you get blocked on a sticky piece 
of code or logical problem, this brisk walk helps almost every time. Often, 
you experience casual moments outside that you always will remember and 
never would have experienced if you’d stayed in your cubicle all day, like that 
majestic hawk that hovered in the blue sky before it alighted on the ledge 
of a distant building.
You tried to estimate its wingspan as it hung frozen in the cerulean blue.
Hey, He Likes Me!
That handsome dude or attractive woman with the healthy glow who spoke 
to you out of the blue that time when you were both sitting on a bench, chill-
ing—that hadn’t happened to you in a long while; it’s usually just awkward 
silences and departures, ships passing at night. You’re going to see him/her 
again sometime; you’re going to swap phone numbers.
You take longer walks sometimes in the city, until you find yourself drifting 
around with a relaxed aimlessness, kind of like Owen Wilson in the movie 
Midnight in Paris. 
You have the usual “meetings” (the quotation marks question their purpose-
fulness) in the mid-morning and afternoon. You stand during both, and it 
seems to have a contagious effect. Two other people stood up during the 
second meeting, and you could have sworn both confabs went a little faster. 
You’re beginning to get a rep as “that healthy guy” around the office.

Knock Off Some Bench Presses
By the end of the day you’ve climbed about 12 floors and maybe walked a 
couple of miles or more (the number of miles you cover in a day, counting 
everything, always surprises you). A formal workout in the middle of the day 
is not necessary. But sometimes you duck into the company fitness facility 
on a rainy day and knock off some bench presses, pull-ups, and inverted 
push-ups. Sometimes it’s just a dash on a treadmill, or some karate kicks fol-
lowed by Tai Chi. It takes no more than about 30 minutes.
Your workouts almost never exceed that length of time. When they do, hors-
ing around would be a better way to describe them than workouts or training 
sessions: playing catch using a winged Nerf football with your son or a friend, 
or gliding along a country road on a mountain bike.
It All Adds Up to Something Good
Are you getting the point here? You’re able to shoulder a pretty hard job 
and commute, while staying healthy, mindful, and reasonably content. The 
days seem to flow more, instead of banging together like an extended train 
wreck, with you occupying the middle passenger car. Who could argue with 
that? You even get the monthly $50 bonus they pay at work to the employ-
ees with the fewest sick days!
The intent of the last assemblage of paragraphs wasn’t to get all vainglori-
ous and virtuous about healthy lifestyles—although it was fun to write—as 
much as to paint a narrative about surviving the Digital Age and emerging 
from your days mostly unscathed (maybe an occasional bruised ego, but 
it comes with the territory, right?). This chapter has introduced some basic 
fitness concepts that the rest of the book will cover in sometimes extensive 
detail:
• Living in the Digital Age, where culture, data, and networks never sleep, 
but still incorporating the sun, lots of walking, and outdoor experiences—
living closer to the imperatives of our preloaded software (our very deep 
past).
• The benefits of whole, nonprocessed, real food—and even a bit of “inter-
mittent” fasting every week.
• The advantages of incorporating ordinary exercise regimes like stair 
climbing, lengthy, aimless walking (no matter how cold it is!), sprints, 
jumps, and hill-climbing extemporaneously, when you can.

• Using useful tracking tools and personal metrics to augment your fit-
ness, share your progress with friends, help others work through some 
physical glitches or sleep issues, or for just plain time-wasting fun (when 
you have that time, that is).
• The importance of sleep and destressing; they could save your life.
• The advantages of other lifestyle tactics like freezing swims, saunas, and 
fasting, not to mention moderate exercise and a good drink now and 
then. These are examples of “hormesis,” or good stress (see Chapter 11).
Unlike many faddish weight-loss and fitness schemes, the changes just 
described do not involve any expensive program or club fees, or drastic 
dietary changes (like “zero carb or fat”), except for the optional purchase of 
a few fun and useful gadgets or tools when you have a little extra change. 
In the next chapter, we look at some of these tools and apps with which you 
can analyze and quantify your fitness progress. 
An Interview With Mark Sisson
Fittingly for this chapter, we 
interviewed Mark Sisson of 
“Primal Blueprint” fame in Fall 
2011. Mark is one of the pioneers 
of, and a powerful voice for what 
you might call the “live according 
to your design” principle.
Mark is a former elite endur-
ance athlete, a popular blogger 
at Mark’s Daily Apple (www.marksdailyapple.com), and he 
runs a health and wellness business (including conferences 
and vitamin supplements) under the rubric of The Primal 
Blueprint (www.primalblueprint.com). 
How did you originally get into the fitness, writing, and health-
supplement business? 
I loved the outdoors as a kid. My childhood was one of 
those idyllic New England ones—staying out all day with 
my friends exploring the wilderness, getting into trouble, 
and running everywhere. Seriously, if one thing about my 
childhood stands out, it’s the constant running. There was 
no real walking. We just ran around. Anyway, I got pretty 
good at running. I was too skinny and short to play basket-
ball or football in school, but I excelled at cross-country. I 
kept running cross-country at college, where I was a biol-
ogy pre-med. 
I decided to forgo med school for a few years (going on 33 
years now) to concentrate on running full time. I got better. 
Five years of running marathons and putting in 100+ miles 
a week culminated in a spot in the Olympic Trials. I was at 
my fittest and fastest, but I was also at my sickest. That year 
I qualified for the Trials, I got eight respiratory infections. I 
had arthritis in my knees and ankles. When I wasn’t running, 
I was hobbling around, eating whatever I could find, pop-
ping anti-inflammatories, and dreading the next training 
session. It sucked.
I couldn’t run competitively anymore, but I could at least try 
to stem the damage. That was right around when triath-
lons started getting popular. I figured that if I couldn’t run 
marathons competitively anymore, maybe if I spread the 
damage across running, biking, and swimming I could get 
away with it. I did, for another few years, even placing 4th in 
the 1982 fall Hawaii Ironman, but eventually I had to call it 
quits... again. That’s when I got serious about nutrition and 
supplementation. I’d already been exploring it to enhance 
my performance, but now I was interested in bolstering my 
ailing immune system and fortifying my falling-apart-at-
age-29 body. My biology background naturally led me to 
consider all this stuff from an evolutionary standpoint, and 
it just seemed to make a ton of sense. More importantly, 
it worked, so I decided to make a life out of it. I’d seen 
what chronic endurance training did to my peers, and I’d 
felt what it’d done to my health. I couldn’t take away my 
past, but I felt I could help steer others away from similar 
mistakes.

An Interview With Mark Sisson (continued)
I know your blog and the Primal Blueprint/book are very 
popular. Can you make a rough estimate of how many people 
have embraced the PB as part of their lifestyle, including over-
seas? It seems like the appeal would transcend culture.
It’s difficult to say. I can give you the book sales figures and 
monthly blog visits (blog is currently over two million visits 
per month), both of which continue to climb steadily, but 
those won’t necessarily tell the whole story. My most reli-
able marker is the number of emails I get from people with 
basic questions about the lifestyle. If you’re asking me if rid-
ing your bike to work is Chronic Cardio (depends), if hemp 
seeds are Primal (sure), if intermittent fasting is right for 
your diabetic mother (can’t say), or whether your method 
of cooking salmon is oxidizing the Omega-3 fatty acids, 
chances are you’ve already embraced the Primal Blueprint. 
I get several hundred of those emails every week, and the 
number has been steadily rising, including those I receive 
from overseas email addresses. That’s my barometer—folks 
engaged enough to have encountered problems that need 
answering, typed up an email, and sent it out. 
The appeal definitely transcends culture. A big help, 
unfortunately, has been the discrepancy between the US 
and other nations in degree of belief in evolution. A recent 
poll just came out showing that just 16% of the US believes 
in “secular evolutionary theory.” 16%! What’s scary is that 
figure is up from 9% in 1999. 
Each element of the Primal Blueprint seems perfectly sensible 
to me, yet has there been any backlash? 
Backlash? Some. It’s not like it’s being meted out by the 
authorities or anything, but I’ve noticed that the movement 
is getting a lot more attention in the media. I can’t even re-
member how many articles I’ve read featuring some stuffy 
nutrition “expert” casually shrugging off the “supposed 
benefits” of the “caveman diet.” It’s the new Atkins in that 
it’s the new whipping boy for threatened dietitians. I’m all 
for disagreement. I love rebuttals. I welcome them. But not 
when they’re based on faulty premises, blatantly incorrect 
data, and widely held misconceptions. If detractors would 
come to the table with some honest arguments address-
ing the science, rather than making cracks about cavemen 
dying at 25 and asking why we still use computers, wear 
clothes, and drive cars, I’d be happy.
But mostly, it’s just basic ignorance of all this stuff. Not igno-
rance in the pejorative sense, but ignorance in the “they are 
simply not aware of anything but the official story” sense. 
Old myths die hard. I have to remind myself that even 
though the Primal community is growing every single day, 
we’re still a fledgling group. We’re still a very vocal minority 
dwarfed by the millions upon millions that never even think 
to question what they’ve been told all their lives. 
Do you have a favorite web-connected health or fitness 
gadget?
I’m with you on this one; they’re fun, but usually unnec-
essary. I’m very much a tech guy in that my business is 
web-based, I blog every day, I use Twitter, but as for the 
health gadgets? I’ve never really felt the need. Actually, you 
know what? I do like the tech stuff that enables, rather than 
impedes, a more evolutionary existence. So, online forums, 
like my own or Paleohacks, where people can gather “with 
their tribe” and communicate, solve problems, get into ar-
guments, and emerge better, more informed people. Those 
are cool and ultimately helpful. I’m also a big fan of F.lux, a 
nice app that dampens the blue light emissions from your 
computer screen. Blue light has repeatedly been shown to 
cancel melatonin production and disrupt sleep, so all those 
people staying up late staring into their laptop (which is ba-
sically everyone these days, right?) would probably benefit 
from installing it.

Fitness tools and apps are web-based software, hardware, or hardware/
software combinations that can track and provide feedback on your fitness 
adventures. They are tools made in heaven for geeks, as they blend all kinds 
of workouts with the online and fitness worlds. Many of them are essentially 
wearable computers that generate reams of data and catchy, revealing web 
graphics. Most allow the downloading of the data so that you can do your 
own coding, as in GPS Exchange (GPX) XML files.
These tools often work through a cell phone app (such as Endomondo or 
RunKeeper), or they provide a little device or gadget that can connect with 
a website, as in the Fitbit Tracker. The website provides you with your own 
dashboard, a central place where you can view your personal stats, aggre-
gated over the months and years, as well as digital maps of where you’ve 
been.
Quantified Self
The place to go to find out about the latest tracking devices is Quantified 
Self (www.quantifiedself.com). This web group describes itself as “a place for 
people interested in self-tracking to gather, share knowledge and experi-
ences, and discover resources.” It is an excellent resource for all kinds of 
tracking devices, posting information on the latest and greatest online web 
tools, beyond sports or health tracking. 
For example, through Quantified Self I have found two other web tracking 
sites I’d like to check out in the future: FuelFrog for tracking your vehicle’s 
fuel use, and WattVision, which can help you increase the energy efficiency 
of your house. The master listing of tracking tools is here: http://quantified-

Sports and Fitness Tracking
Chapter 2
20
Sports and Fitness Tracking
Of course, in this book we’re primarily interested in sports and fitness track-
ers, often using the Global Positioning System (GPS) software of your smart-
hone or sports watch. We’ve also analyzed an extra flavoring of nutrition-
oriented software. 
The fitness-tracking tools, a subset of which are described in this chapter, 
seem to have these features in common:
• They track fitness and nutrition with easy-to-record metrics and web-
sites that automatically update colorful graphs and tables.
• They motivate the users to set goals, monitor progress, and team up 
and share with other users to create a self-reinforcing network—a tribe, 
in other words.
• In most of the cases, such as Endomondo and Garmin, the software 
allows the export of the data generated from fitness training (such as a 
GPS file), so it can be imported into another application or simply exam-
ined the way all of us geeks would read code.
For the sake of brevity, we cannot cover in detail all of the major web-based 
fitness tools (which include RunKeeper, Nike+, Training Peaks, and the 
MapMyFitness sites), but we think we’ve included an eclectic selection to get 
you started with fitness tracking apps. This chapter also describes a couple 
of online nutrition tools in more detail, including NutritionData and FitDay.
Personal Metrics
These visual displays of data, on cell phones, laptops, and PCs, allow you to 
initiate a little investigative work on your life. For example, you may want to 
manage your weight, aspire to athletic goals, deal with physical issues like 
lowering your blood pressure (e.g., “How does my blood pressure respond 
to time of day or certain dietary changes?”), or simply isolate patterns and 
correlations in the data that you would never have pinpointed before. 
“Hey… I’m sitting too much during the day, and not getting enough 
quality REM sleep.”
The personal metrics have another practical purpose, too. You can share the 
data with sports trainers or doctors, or you can take matters into your own 
hands rather than paying an expensive expert’s fees. After all, who’s more 
qualified to examine the feedback from your own body and mind than you?
Fitness tracking apps and devices can often connect and integrate each 
other’s data. We’ll get into this a bit when discussing the integration of GPS 
data from Endomondo or Garmin into Google Earth.

examine the feedback from 
your own body and mind  
than you?

Gear ≠ Health
Fitness apps are fun and motivating, and they provide useful biofeedback, 
compile personal metrics in interesting ways, and are closely tied into the 
computer technology that you know well and love—but they are not strictly 
necessary for maintaining health. Our vigorous foraging ancestors did not 
have Fitbit or Endomondo. You can stay pretty darn healthy without fiddling 
with gear hanging off your belt and constantly consulting a web page. 
On the other hand, many people swear by these apps for meeting new 
health and fitness goals, and they are, beyond a shadow of a doubt, nifty 
tools for analyzing personal data, playing with, and programming. They also 
seem to have a “tail wagging the dog” effect in terms of nudging you to 
accumulate more mileage and move about more. 
As Chapter 1 discussed, evolution has apparently coded us for more or 
less continuous motion—an oscillation of movement throughout the 
day. Far from being a moderately harmless lazy habit, “chair living” 
has scientifically documented negative health effects.
Let’s jump right in and examine some of these devices.
Fitbit Tracker
Fitbit is a San Francisco–based company that distributes a small motion-
sensor device called the Fitbit Tracker (shown in Figure 2-1). You can clip the 
device to your belt, your sleeve, or wherever is handy. It has a 3D accelerom-
eter that uses technology similar to the Nintendo Wii to analyze your motion 
throughout the day, compiling comprehensive statistics that you can ogle 
and digest later. 
The device is like a pedometer on steroids. It connects with a small base 
station that plugs into the USB port of your computer, mainly to recharge 
the device, because the data can be wirelessly synced to the product’s com-
panion web pages. 
The handy little Tracker has its own display that will sequentially show the 
steps you’ve taken so far for the day, your accumulated mileage, an estimate 
of the calories burned, and a flower icon that is meant to indicate your activ-
ity level for the last three hours (you make it grow by becoming more active). 
The Tracker will automatically sync its data whenever it is within 15 feet of 
any plugged-in base station (i.e., not just the base station plugged into your 
own computer).

life in motion

The Dashboard
Fitbit really shines when you connect with its dashboard after logging in at 
www.fitbit.com. Figure 2-2 shows my dashboard for a day in late September. 
The dashboard shows how many steps you’ve taken (in the thousands, 
unless you’re bedridden with a broken leg from skiing), calories burned and 
eaten (if you’ve logged them), how many miles you covered, and an Active 
Score, which is a numerical indication of how active you have been through-
out the day.
The Active Score is a reflection of your metabolic equivalent of task (MET), 
which is how much energy you’re expending by taking part in certain activi-
ties. Sitting all day is a MET equivalent of 1, for example. Running hard would 
be a MET of 9.5.1
Figure 2-2. A segment of the Fitbit dashboard
The Fitbit FAQ (www.fitbit.com/faq) states that you can roughly calcu-
late the average metabolic equivalent for the day by using this equa-
tion: METs = Active Score * .001 + 1. See the discussion in Chapter 1 on 
MET.

Fitness Tools and Apps
23
Fitbit Tracker
For example, on this day, I took more than 14,000 steps (glad I wasn’t count-
ing!) and strode about 6.4 miles. My Active Score was 1236, which added up 
to an average MET for the day of about 2.34 (Active Score x .001 + 1). This is 
the equivalent MET output of someone doing light construction work.
If you’re in a “generalized active state,” up and down and fidgety in a healthy 
way, it’s surprising how many miles you can amass by the end of the day. 
The Tracker provides a fairly accurate figure for striding (I tested it against 
my phone- and watch-based GPS gadgets during walks). 
To provide even more precision, you can enter Fitbit’s settings and specify 
your step and running-stride lengths.
Nifty Charts
The key advantage of the Fitbit is that it measures, with a certain degree of 
accuracy, your generalized pattern of activity and movement. 
We seem to be designed for a steady “background noise” of movement 
throughout the day, rather than the “regularly scheduled workout” 
followed by long sedentary sits. (Think of a person hunting and gath-
ering food.) Because it doesn’t just focus on individual workouts, the 
Fitbit often gives you a superior reflection of your health habits com-
pared with other tools. 
For example, the “miles traveled” reported on the dashboard represents an 
estimate of all the mileage accumulated through the day, including walking 
to get the mail and climbing the stairs to fetch your raincoat. It even seems 
to pick up the greater effort expended when you stand rather than sitting 
at your workstation. 
According to recent research described in a cardiology journal,2 even people 
who work out most days do not benefit from this activity when they spend 
the rest of their time prone in front of screens (TVs, computers, video games, 
etc.). 
If you’re in a “generalized active 
state,” up and down and fidgety 
in a healthy way, it’s surprising 
how many miles you can amass 
by the end of the day.

Figure 2-3 shows a nice chart on the bottom left part of the dashboard indi-
cating the activity patterns throughout the day.
Figure 2-3. A Fitbit chart logs your high-stepping moves
Based on this chart, you could draw the simple conclusion that you needed 
to take short walks at the start and end of each day. Every step counts, and 
that’s valid from a metabolic-health standpoint. Figure 2-3 shows the pat-
tern of spikes (the number of steps or equivalent exercise) during my day 
from an easy mountain-bike ride, a walk downtown for middle-of-the-day 
errands, and a basketball shoot with my son at dusk. 
The Fitbit does not capture non-step-related activities like biking or 
resistance training (beyond the general movement involved in getting 
on, off, and around a bike, for instance). But you can manually log 
these activities and thus include their caloric expenditure (the Fitbit 
will overwrite that segment of time with your own values for calories 
burned). See the sections on Endomondo and Fitocracy for discussions 
of capturing and logging certain sports like cycling and weightlifting.
As mentioned earlier, all of these tools have an odd but unmistakable “tail 
wagging the dog” effect—they tend to increase your movement and inclina-
tion to exercise, rather than solely recording and displaying your activities. 
You might find yourself thinking, “I’m going to walk to work today so I can 
bump up my Active Score. I’ll try to break my time record from yesterday.”

Logging with Fitbit
You can log many aspects of your lifestyle with Fitbit, thus adding to the 
benchmarks you set. You can also create your own variables to track (e.g., 
cups of coffee or beers consumed in a day). Figure 2-4 shows the tabs for 
food, activities (walking, biking, etc.), sleep, journal entries, and more.
Figure 2-4. Logging lifestyle bits in Fitbit
The Food tab obviously allows you to keep track of calories burned and con-
sumed, as well as a basic macronutrient ratio dealing with your percentages 
of carbs, protein, and fats (see Chapter 3 for more on food chemistry). 
Logging all of these aspects is optional, but it gives you more ingredients for 
the tool’s rich interface. I actually think FitDay (www.fitday.com) is a better 
tool for logging food intake, which is generally a tedious and time-consuming, 
if often revealing, effort. See later in this chapter for a FitDay discussion. 
Fitbit will give you an analysis of your sleep patterns if you wear the tracking 
device around your wrist while you sleep, using the provided wrist strap. I 
thought it might be useful to try this once, but the idea of the device track-
ing me while I slept gave me the heebie-jeebies, and since I already sleep 
well, regard that as an optional feature. It is neat, however, to look over a 
chart showing the patterns of your sleep.

Mobile Version
You can access Fitbit’s mobile version with your smartphone browser at 
m.fitbit.com. It’s not an app, but a mobile website: a manner of accessing the 
rich interface on a smaller screen, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Online Community
The Fitbit interface has a Community tab that gives users access to various 
forums where they can interact with other users. The interactive features 
can be as simple as emailing a web page showing your dashboard or auto-
matically posting the data to other sites like Twitter, Facebook, WordPress, or 
Microsoft HealthVault.
Like most of these web-based fitness services, Fitbit also has a paid premium 
service that provides views of your accomplishments against a benchmark 
of other users, using various demographics as a filter for the data. For exam-
ple, I can compare my exercise patterns against those of other men my age. 
Figure 2-6 shows a Fitbit bar chart from the premium service.
Figure 2-6. A dynamically generated report in Fitbit
Fitbit API
Fitbit has an application programming interface (API) for outside developers 
or geeks who simply want to access their own data for coding: http://dev.
fitbit.com.
This code uses a Java API called Fitbit4J, but it also includes APIs for PHP 
and .NET, for instance. Developers first have to register with Fitbit (at dev.
fitbit.com), and they receive via email authentication codes to use with their 
applications. 
Figure 2-5. Fitbit’s screen for mobile devices

Fitness Tools and Apps
27
Endomondo
The API design is a RESTful web service that uses an open source security 
protocol called oauth. This process involves making HTTP requests for the 
Fitbit data, after first satisfying an authorization step by sending along the 
credentials the developer obtained from the Fitbit developer site. 
You have a “consumer key” and a “consumer secret,” both long hexa-
decimal numbers that look like 0f92959d8bc4483cda7bce0074d-
c26bc.
There’s a good tutorial on using RESTful web services with oauths at http://
developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/restwebservices.html.
One possible use for the API is grabbing your Fitbit data and mashing it up 
with data collected on another online fitness database, like Endomondo.
Endomondo
The Endomondo Sports Tracker is a free smartphone or Blackberry app that 
records your sports workouts and links the data to its website (www.endo-
mondo.com). 
Endomondo also sells a premium version.
On the Endomondo website, you can share your data and interact with other 
users. Endomondo has its headquarters in Denmark. Figure 2-7 shows what 
the home page looks like once you’ve logged in.
Figure 2-7. Endomondo Sports Tracker home page

Endomondo
Chapter 2
28
Here’s how the app works, using an example of a recent mountain-bike 
ride. You install the free or Pro version of the mobile app on your phone (it’s 
available for Android, Blackberry, and the iPhone). Before you begin your 
workout, you fire up the app on your device and, using its interface, choose 
the type of sport (e.g., running, fitness walking, cycling). Then you start the 
timer to log your workout. Figure 2-8 shows the phone app interface.
Off I go on my mountain bike, heading for the open road with a few dips 
into the forest. 
Figure 2-8. A mobile interface for the Endomondo Sports Tracker
Hit the “countdown” button, and a voice counts down from five or 
however you set it, then says “Free your endorphins!” I like that amus-
ing feature; during the countdown, I shove the phone into a coat 
pocket and step into the pedals. You can configure the length of the 
countdown in the app’s settings.
The Endomondo app uses your phone’s GPS capability to track the fitness 
event so that it can give you dynamic mileage updates and map the workout 
later. As you ride along, your phone emits a pleasant voice each mile: “You’ve 
reached mile 10 in 51 minutes; last mile five minutes nineteen seconds…” 
If your phone is capable of immediately uploading the training session to 
Endomondo’s website, your friends and everyone else hooked into the site 
can see that you’ve hopped on a bike, pulled on your running shoes, or 
whatever, and headed out onto the trail or pavement.

The statistics, along with the audio feedback during the workout (which can 
include “pep talks” from your friends), are handy and fun. Figure 2-9 shows 
the map and statistics from my bike ride. The app uses Google Maps with 
interactive features to show your pace at each mile.
Figure 2-9. Endomondo maps and stats
Exporting Files from Endomondo
You can export these workouts in the GPS Exchange format (.gpx files) and 
Garmin’s XML format, called TCX (.tcx files). 
These formats represent different types of XML files that contain route, way-
point, and other GPS- and fitness-related data reflected by a mapped work-
out. The following site provides you with the XML schemas for several XML 
formats that are used by Garmin, Google Earth, and other tools (including 
GPX, TCX, and KML files): http://developer.garmin.com/schemas/. 
To output an Endomondo workout as XML, click the Export button at the 
bottom right of the page, as shown in Figure 2-9.
What can you do with the data? Well, you can import it into another device 
or piece of software that supports the file type, or use XML-processing code 
to make additional kinds of software out of it (see the “Import Your GPS File 
into Google Earth” sidebar).

Here’s a chunk of XML code from a .gpx file, for instance. This code encapsu-
lates a couple of track points, or latitude/longitude points with an elevation

Import Your GPS File into Google Earth
You can import a GPS file (such as one with a .gpx suffix) into Google Earth, 
then view the route you took within that application. Here’s how to do it from 
Endomondo:
1.	 Export a .gpx file from within the Endomondo app (see “Exporting Files 
from Endomondo”).
2.	 Launch the Google Earth application (there’s a free version) and choose 
File→Open from within that application. I had to resave the file Endo-
mondo exported, called no name.gpx.xml, to mytrek.gpx in the text-handling 
application BBEdit (notice the suffix change; I lopped off the .xml part) 
before Google Earth would recognize the file.
3.	 Select the file you just exported (and possibly renamed).
4.	 The file will open up into a Google Earth aerial view showing your route. 
You can use other file types as well (see http://earth.google.com/outreach/
tutorial_importgps.html#gpxfile).
How Many Times Around the World?
Another spiffy region of the Endomondo home page is the lower-left hand 
corner, an ongoing aggregation of the highlights of your recorded work-
outs. It’ll tell you how many burgers you’ve burned, how many times you’ve 
circumnavigated the globe, and how many trips you’ve taken to the moon 
(since I’d just began with Endomondo, I had only traversed the equator the 
equivalent of 0.002 times). Figure 2-10 shows this portion of the screen.

Fitness Tools and Apps

Figure 2-10. Tracking how many burgers you’ve burned
Many fitness-tracking tools take a “more is better” approach (gotta get 
around the earth a second time!), but, as we’ll discuss in Chapter 9, over-
training is not necessary to get both strong and healthy. In fact, years of 
overtraining can lead to ill health. 
A common metaphor to use when representing strength training, for 
instance, is “digging a hole and filling it in.” When you task the muscles 
with hard, consecutive, high-intensity training sessions, you’re digging 
the hole deeper and deeper, but never giving your body the necessary 
rest to initiate the training adaptations, or the “filling in,” of the hole.
One of the strengths of Fitbit and similar tools is that you can choose to track 
anything, such as rest days and less intense sessions. Then you can assess 
how your strength gains and energy levels correspond with the number of 
rest days and/or easy sessions.

Fitocracy
Fitocracy (www.fitocracy.com) is another sports-tracking tool, as well as a 
community with interactive features. It has the additional benefit of provid-
ing better support than others in the areas of resistance training and body-
weight exercises. 
At the time I used Fitocracy, it was released as a beta version.
Along with tracking your training data, Fitocracy is built around an award 
system where you earn points for each exercise bout and eventually work 
your way up to different levels. According to its own getting started guide, 
“Fitocracy is a game you play to improve your fitness.” 
It seems to be designed to initiate friendly competition against your friends 
or yourself, similar to the model of computer gaming, but with a decidedly 
fitter result. Figure 2-11 shows a profile for a Fitocracy beginner.

It is admittedly complex to input resistance-training sessions, with all the 
different techniques, sets, and repetitions. Fitocracy is one of the few online 
tools that has a rich interface for logging weightlifting, which should help 
the company down the line as resistance training becomes de rigeur for 
many athletes (more on this in Chapter 8). 
Fitocracy’s rich interface includes handy tips for describing dozens of differ-
ent resistance-training routines.
Figure 2-12 shows a screen for entering a weightlifting workout that includes 
body-weight exercises like pull-ups and push-ups.
Figure 2-12. Rich interface for logging resistance training
You can click back and forth between training sessions on different days, as 
well as view a history showing when you did a particular routine before. You 
can log any kind of exercise activity, however, and Fitocracy autogenerates a 
window with suggestions, making it easy to pop up a logging window that’s 
customized for that particular sport.

Of course, none of these sites would be complete without community fea-
tures. Fitocracy has groups, a forum, a “leaderboard” showing all the point-
hoarding honchos, and a feature for following other people. It doesn’t seem 
to have a way of exporting the data yet, but it was still a beta version at the 
time of this writing. Fitocracy does have a mobile version, allowing you to 
produce a smartphone in the gym and instantly record your recent grap-
pling with the barbells or free weights. 
See Chapter 8 for a bit more on the Fitocracy mobile app, as well as on 
weightlifting in general.
Garmin Connect
Garmin Connect (http://connect.garmin.com) is the web portal you will use 
for any Garmin GPS tracking tool. The Garmin device (in this case a Garmin 
Forerunner 301) connects to your computer via a USB connection cable, as 
Figure 2-13 shows.

NutritionData
The rest of this chapter introduces a couple of nutrition tools on the Web, 
as well as an example of a connected device—you use the device at home, 
and the data is sent to a website or to other software tools. It’s called the 
Withings body-composition scale. Yes, you heard that correctly—your bath-
room scale (this one, on steroids) can capture your data and wirelessly send 
it to a website.
Hmm, maybe you don’t want that to happen…
NutritionData
We looked at NutritionData (www.nutritiondata.com) a bit in Chapter 1. This 
section will point out a few more interesting aspects of this tool. If you’re 
already a NutritionData honcho, feel free to move on to the brief discussions 
of FitDay and the USDA Nutritional Database that follow.
For the sake of our discussion, initiate a search on mussels (the shellfish, 
not the ones you flex in front of a mirror): http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/
finfish-and-shellfish-products/4187/2. The screen in Figure 2-16 has a graphic 
for “Caloric Ratio” showing the macronutrient ratio for the food. 
NutritionData also gives values for “Glycemic Load” and 
“Inflammation.” You basically want to keep the number on the left 
down (as in, foods that tend to spike blood-glucose levels and thus 
the hormone insulin and are therefore high glycemic), and increase 
the right hand number (reduce inflammatory foods, which in this tool 
means avoiding negative numbers).
Figure 2-16. Mussels pack a lot of protein muscle

A macronutrient ratio represents how the food content is divided up by 
percent of calories into carbs, fats, and proteins. Mussels, for example, are 18 
percent carbohydrates, 23 percent fats, and 59 percent protein. 
This feature gives you a snapshot of the nutritional content of the food 
(along with the nutrition label showing about 24 grams of protein in a fairly 
small serving of mussels). So we know that mussels are a great source of 
protein, but what about fats or micronutrients?
If you scroll down to the regions representing fats, vitamins, and minerals 
(Figure 2–17), the data on mussels offers some pleasant surprises. This shell-
fish portion contains a lot of vitamin C for a protein-rich food (almost 14 
grams; hey, more than enough to stop you getting scurvy!), as well as about 
four times as much vitamin B12 as you would need in a day.
Figure 2-17. These mussels are stylin’ from a nutrient standpoint
Mussels are also a great source of selenium, manganese, iron, and other 
minerals (see Chapter 4 on micronutrients). Check out the Fats & Fatty Acids 
box too; mussels have an Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio of 866 mg to 36 mg, 
or about 24:1. This means that a small portion of mussels gives you almost 
a gram of Omega 3 essential fatty acids, which are generally considered a 
health food in moderate amounts. Our modern diet contains way too many 
Omega 6 fats compared to Omega 3s; see Chapter 3, for a discussion of these 
ratios.
NutritionData also has a self-tracking feature under the MyND section of 
the site. After registering, you can track and analyze the nutritional content 
of certain foods, as shown in Figure 2-18. Let’s say you want to brag to your 
friends about how nutritious mussels are (thus increasing your weirdness

quotient in their eyes). Tracking removes the need to continually search for 
the same food items.

FitDay
FitDay (www.fitday.com) is one of the better tools around for tracking your 
diet and its underlying nutrition, or lack thereof. We’re going to look at 
FitDay again in Chapters 3 and 4, but this section serves as an introduction.
FitDay is useful for the periodic tracking of a whole or partial diet to get a 
snapshot of its macro- and micronutrient content. 
FitDay differs from NutritionData in this respect by analyzing numer-
ous foods at once—an entire day’s worth of eating—rather than 
single portions or ingredients.
Conveniently, FitDay saves the foods you’ve entered before, which makes 
the otherwise tedious data entry go quicker the second time around. Figure 
2-19 shows the table produced from a partial day’s food intake. Each day you 
enter your food intake is saved in a calendar for later retrieval.

This shows you exactly where all your carbs, fats, and proteins are coming 
from. “So what?” you might ask. Do we really have to obsess over our “mac-
ronutrient ratios”? In most cases, no. But an associated micronutrient profile 
can be very useful and revealing.
FitDay can drill down into a complete vitamin and mineral profile for the 
assemblage of food you just chowed down on and recorded, as depicted in 
Figure 2-20. Although bioavailability—how much of the consumed nutrient, 
like vitamin C or selenium, actually reached its target tissue—is a complex 
issue, it seems conceivable that this data will be reasonably accurate, given 
that you consumed the nutrients as food, not a pill.
Figure 2-20. Micronutrient lineup in a FitDay window
This kind of data can make a recommendation such as “maintain a 
potassium:sodium (P:S) ratio of at least 4:1” more concrete and thus easier 
to grasp. You know the foods represented in Figure 2-19 gave you a P:S ratio 
of 2,890 to 427, or about 6.8 to 1.

What if you just want to know what a single serving like “bagel smeared with 
jelly and margarine” is doing for you? No sweat, as shown in the micronutri-
ent profile depicted in Figure 2-21. 
Figure 2-21. The jelly-bagel sandwich tasted good, but it was hurtin’ in the nutrient department
The figures in red mean that the food is beneath the Recommended Dietary 
Allowance (RDA) for that nutrient (see Chapter 4). We’ll give you the benefit 
of the doubt—you’ll make up those deficits with meals later in the day. 
The dressed-up wheat bagel is high in sodium and fairly deficient in nutri-
ents, for a 614-calorie snack (300 of those calories coming from the bagel 
and 188 from the 1.5 tablespoons of margarine and jelly—we promised 
“smeared”!). When you’re scarfing down that many calories, you usually want 
to get more bang for the buck in terms of nutrients.

The USDA National Nutrient Database

The USDA National Nutrient Database
Many of the nutrition tools on the Web use the data from the USDA National 
Nutrient Database: www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/. This is a no-
frills website where you can initiate searches, as shown in Figure 2-22, and/
or download the entire database. 
Figure 2-22. A federal government nutrient database search
Instead of searching this database, which is cut-and-dried, we’ll show anoth-
er cool way of acquiring data from this site. 
Let’s say you want to discover the best food sources of selenium, an impor-
tant antioxidant mineral source (you’ll show more than a casual interest in 
minerals and antioxidants after reading Chapter 4!). 
Go to this URL: www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=22114. Scroll 
down to selenium, then click on the “Sorted by Nutrient Content” option.

You can download an updated version of the National Nutrient Database 
itself (in a ZIP file), then import the numerous data files into whatever data-
base management system you’re using, such as MySQL.
Here’s the link for downloading the database: www.ars.usda.gov/Services/
docs.htm?docid=22113. 
Release 23 of the database includes about a dozen different data files. 
In other words, the National Nutrient Database is relational, not one 
giant chunk of data.

Pointy-Headed Searches
If you’re in a very scholarly state of mind, you can search for the latest aca-
demic journal articles on PubMed (http://pubmed.com) or Google Scholar 
(http://scholar.google.com).
PubMed
PubMed includes “21 million citations for biomedical literature from 
MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books.”
You can often access the entire article for free; at other times, free access is 
limited to the journal abstract. Figure 2-24 shows a result from searching on 
the Boolean expression “resistance training AND oxidative stress.” Typically, 
the upper-righthand corner of the page containing the abstract provides 
any available links to the full-text version.

It’s irritating, to say the least, to find an intriguing new journal article, then 
click on the link and discover that the publisher wants $30–$60 to read 
anything but the abstract. That makes it pretty hard for a student, or simply 
a health-conscious geek, to undertake interesting research. If you run into 
this problem, your college or town might have a library subscription, for 
instance, to an online journal-retrieval system like EBSCO that you can use 
for free.
Google Scholar
Google Scholar provides similar access to scholarly and academic articles on 
nutrition and fitness studies. Sometimes you can search on an article title to 
determine if the full text of the study is available, as shown in Figure 2-25.
You may want to bone up on the differences between good and bad 
science if you’re going to become a PubMed or Google Scholar geek.

A mounting trend for geeks and techies in the sports world is the use of 
arrays of connected sports gear and websites. First the gadgets capture par-
ticular athletic-training events like running, biking, Nordic skiing, and hiking, 
then the service broadcasts the data to several places. 
In many ways, this integration represents the inclusion of your fitness 
or health routine in “the cloud.” Cloud computing in general lets you 
initiate more of your IT tasks, including saving and retrieving data, 
using devices such as smartphones and laptops that are all connected 
together and interrelated on the Internet.
Many sports-gear manufacturers are taking this route, such as Garmin 
Connect and the Nike+ program (see http://nikerunning.nike.com/nikeos/p/
nikeplus/en_US/plus/). We’ve already described Fitbit in great detail. Another 
device that has been integrated with Fitbit’s data is the Withings body-
composition scale. This is a scale that wirelessly connects to a website and 
uploads the data from the scale. Withings also makes a blood-pressure 
monitor. I guess you would call this an example of “e-health.”
Figure 2-26 shows the Dashboard at http://my.withings.com/en/, once you 
have registered as a user and, of course, bought and configured the device.
Figure 2-26. The Withings dashboard for a body-composition analyzer
To get started, you’ll have to go to http://start.withings.com and 
download some pairing software (as in, pairing up your computer and 
the scale). You have to connect the scale to your computer using a USB 
cable. The scale then recognizes the wireless network your computer 
is using so it can independently connect with the Web later and wire-
lessly upload its data.

47
Connected Devices
What’s more, Fitbit and other online communities such as Twitter, 
TrainingPeaks, and Google Health can also access the data from Withings 
and incorporate it into their own data and displays. 
All of this is configured within a Sharing preference on the Withings 
dashboard—your information isn’t just blindly sent out to the world.
A body-composition scale measures not just weight, but body fat percent-
age. Your lean mass is the nonfatty tissue part of your body—the bones, 
muscles, and organs.
Muscles also contain fats in the membranes of cells, as well as a rela-
tively large amount of fat that they can call upon for burning as fuel. 
In addition, internal organs have fats in their cell membranes, and are 
cushioned from body blows by adipose tissue.
Your body fat percentage defines the part of the body that is not lean mass. 
It is often a more relevant detail of your physical fitness than Body Mass 
Index (BMI), which is skewed in people who are more muscular—they have 
a higher BMI, but it’s reflective of more muscle than fat.
The Withings scale is pricey, at about $160. You can buy a Tanita body-composition 
analyzer, a device that also uses electrical impedance technology but with-
out the web connections, for about half that amount, or you might choose 
to share one of these devices with your friends or teammates. 
I suppose it’s cool that you can do it, but do you really need to broad-
cast your weight, body composition, or blood pressure everywhere? 
Some might find it motivating, to know that others can track their 
progress; it builds in another level of accountability and motivation.
Electrical impedance technology sends a tiny electric current through your 
body when you stand on the scale (don’t worry, it’s not dangerous!). Using 
an algorithm, the scale measures the feedback from this electrical current to 
estimate muscle vs. fat tissue. It’s only a rough estimate of your body com-
position percentage. Numerous factors affect the results these devices spit 
out, including where you place the scale, how you stand on it (including 
whether you’re in the buff or not!), and even the time of day and whether 
you’ve recently exercised. Your body composition doesn’t change dras-
tically week by week, so don’t obsess over wildly fluctuating numbers. 
Just aim for a general trend. It’s worth it to pay attention to your body 
composition; it’s a much better reflection of health than a static weight 
measurement.

Training Your Brain: Lumosity
Our roundup in this 
chapter wouldn’t be 
complete without a 
discussion of a brain-
training tool. Recent 
neuroscience research 
has shown that the 
brain is not stuck as a 
static anatomical entity 
from birth and early 
development, as once 
thought. The brain can be strengthened and made more 
robust with exercise (of a cerebral nature, that is), similar to 
a muscle. 
The fancy term for this is “neuroplasticity.” According to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity, neuroplasticity: 
…is a nonspecific neuroscience term referring to the 
ability of the brain and nervous system in all species 
to change structurally and functionally as a result 
of input from the environment. Plasticity occurs on 
a variety of levels, ranging from cellular changes 
involved in learning to large-scale changes involved 
in cortical remapping in response to injury… 
Lumosity (www.lumosity.com) is a popular online train-
ing tool that involves implementing exercises and games. 
The games are personalized based on the goals that you 
specify, e.g., improved memory, processing speed, or spatial 
recognition. 
It’s fun to use and as you progress through your customized 
program, the site builds a Brain Performance Index (BPI). 
This score is a reflection of how well you do in the games 
and your cognitive strength as you pump it up over time. 
As the company describes it: 
Each time you play, we update your BPI to accu-
rately reflect your current brain performance… Your 
Overall BPI is your average BPI across each of the five 
cognitive areas: attention, memory, speed, flexibility 
and problem solving” (www.lumosity.com/blog/bpi-
brain-performance-index/).
With the “teaser” free trial, you can try out Lumosity games 
without the running tally of your BPI or the ability to 
compare it with that of other users. A fairly pricey premium 
version for brain games gives you these features and more. 
Or, you could just begin learning a new foreign language 
(Spanish, German, or Mandarin, anyone?).

Most of the stuff you consume, other than the water content, is made up 
of macronutrients: substances humans require for energy, in relatively large 
amounts. I’m tempted to say that macronutrients are the nutrients that you 
can see (as opposed to micronutrients like vitamins or minerals), since the 
plate that shows the ice-cream scoop of white mashed potato laid beside a 
sliver of salmon clearly depicts a carb sitting next to a protein (although both 
foods might have a smidgeon or more of other macronutrients in them—
salmon, for example, is about 40 percent fat).
Ta-da, the macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
What do we mean by “large amounts”? That would be a total of roughly 300 
to 600 grams of carbs, fat, and protein for someone who takes in from 2,000 
to 3,000 calories per day (and much more for the lumberjacks and mountain 
guides who eat 7,000 calories per day). 
You have to consume macronutrients to convert their intrinsic energy to 
your own fuel, as well as for the growth, replacement, and maintenance of 
your bodily tissues.
You could include water or fiber in the macronutrient category, but we’ll 
focus on the top three. I’m sure you’ve run across protein, fats, and carbs 
before, even as these terms assume new meanings, propelled along by 
hypermarketing and branding of trendy new dietary regimes like “high pro-
tein” or “very low carb.” They tend to become scientific rather than political 
footballs, as experts vie with one another in their health emphasis on one or 
another macronutrient. 
Empower Yourself
This chapter goes into quite a bit of detail on these nutrients, simply because 
it aids your fitness efforts to understand more precisely what you’re putting 
in your mouth. Importantly, the chapter will spend a fair amount of time on 
tools such as NutritionData, because they are self-empowering and no one 
likes making their own intellectual determinations and health choices more 
than a food geek.

The nutrition world is certainly a moving target, in terms of the debates that 
rage on about which of the macronutrients are healthier as foci for your diet. 
In my humble opinion, neither the status quo public health recommenda-
tions nor the latest inflammatory food blogs are reliable enough to slavishly 
follow. There’s never been a better time to take the bull by the horns and do 
your own research. 
Most geeks who are aiming for fitness have some kind of goal in mind (e.g., 
getting leaner, building muscle, building a baby). While we all understand 
that eating doesn’t require a preparatory biochemical analysis (in fact, 
that preoccupation would probably ruin the meal before the waiter ever 
brought it—particularly for your dinner partners), dietary matters do entail 
the constant launching of complex chemical reactions in your body, as well 
as providing the materials for your own cells over and over again as they are 
regenerated by the trillions. 
Therefore, understanding some of the basics behind food constituents can 
only be empowering. All knowledge without coercion or propaganda is a 
form of personal enlightenment.
In fitness terms, by eating, you’re basically rebuilding yourself, and your level 
of fitness starts with nutrition.
In terms of “building ourselves,” as humans, excluding water and 
minerals, we are composed of about 76 percent fats and 24 percent 
protein by calories, according to the interesting book Perfect Health 
Diet: Four Steps to Renewed Health, Youthful Vitality, and Long 
Life. Authors Paul and Shou-Ching Jaminet, both scientists (one a 
physicist and the other a biochemist), argue that it makes sense to 
eat according to the typical proportion of fats and protein in our own 
bodies. Thus they conclude that we should “eat what we are,” as in a 
majority of fats. For more explanations of their strategy, visit http://
perfecthealthdiet.com.
Macronutrient Ratios
We’ll start by discussing what a macronutrient ratio (MR) is, because this 
term comes up a lot in food discussions and provides a snapshot of the con-
tents of your typical food intake. 
Some people want to fine-tune their MRs, for example, in order to add lean 
mass (a bit more protein and calories in general), lose some extra fat (tightly 
connected to the previous goal), or subtract some carbs because they’re not 
doing the “Race Across America” bike race anymore. The ratio falls into the 
“good to know” category; check on it once and you’re good to go, unless you 
have to radically change your dietary components.
After discussing MRs, we’ll move on to descriptions of each of the three mac-
ronutrients and what happens during digestion (because the carbs, fats, and

protein that go into your mouth are reformulated—mostly ripped apart—by 
the time they hit your bloodstream and body cells).
The Ole 30-50-20 Maneuver
When you eat a typical meal or snack, you usually consume portions of all 
three macronutrients: carbs, fats, and protein. Unless you’re nibbling on a 
stick of butter (100 percent fat by calories), for example, your breakfast might 
contain carbs and maybe a tiny bit of protein (fruit); carbs and some protein 
(toast); or fats, protein, and perhaps a few carbs (meat and eggs). 
You generally don’t have to obsess over your macronutrient ratio if 
you aim for a variety of real food: veggies, fruits, eggs, cheese, fish, 
meats, sweet potatoes, nuts, rice, etc. These choices should allow for 
settling into a sensible and healthy ratio without knowing exactly 
what it is. It’s not as if a hawk ever flies up into the air with the aim to 
“bump up the fats in my macronutrient ratio.” With some nudging in 
the right direction, it should come naturally. 
The MR is the breakdown of the percentage of calories taken up in the food 
by each nutrient, as in 30 percent carbs, 50 percent fats, and 20 percent 
protein. As the lingo goes, this would be a 30-50-20 ratio. Various essential 
micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, are in there too (hopefully!), 
but they are tiny by weight compared with the macros (see Chapter 4 for 
more information about micronutrients).
Figure 3-1 shows a FitDay (www.fitday.com) breakdown of what I had for 
breakfast this morning, about 460 calories worth of fried eggs, fruit, and 
cheese. Each of the fat grams is worth about 9 calories, while carbs and pro-
tein add up to about 4 calories each.
The term kcal or “kilogram calorie” is a more precise term in nutrition 
than “calorie.” It means the amount of energy required to raise the 
temperature of a kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius. “kcal,” however, 
has the same meaning as “calorie” in the context of this discussion.
Figure 3-1. Eggs, fruit, and cheese for breakfast

Macronutrient Ratios
Chapter 3
52
The MR for this small meal was 19 percent carbs, 64 percent fat, and 17 
percent protein, as shown in Figure 3-2. The shorthand way to describe this 
ratio is 19-64-17. A macronutrient ratio is generally one piece of data out of 
a big nutrition picture. If you really wanted to analyze your nutrition inputs, 
you would be better off calculating the MR for a typical week of eating, along 
with your calorie intake (i.e., 2,400 calories per day) and perhaps your activity 
levels, to put all the data into a proper context. 
Hey, you can use the Fitbit tool we told you about in Chapter 2 to 
make this analysis.
Figure 3-2. The macronutrient ratio for a small meal, displayed on FitDay
In this small 460-calorie meal, the ratio of fats was much higher than carbs, 
even though I ate less than 10 more fat grams, because fats have more 
than twice the calorie or energy content of carbs. They are thus considered 
energy-dense foods. The wine, beer, or other alcohol you might drink (actu-
ally containing the chemical ethanol) has about 7 calories per gram.
As you may already know, recommendations for an ideal macronutrient ratio 
range all over the map. Figure 3-3 shows the MRs for a number of popular 
diets, including the Mediterranean, Zone, DASH, South Beach, Atkins, and 
Ornish eating plans. They range from high-carb diets (e.g., Ornish) to low-
carb, higher protein plans, which is often another way of saying high-fat 
diets, because the majority of calories are obtained from fat (e.g., Atkins). 
Figure 3-3 is derived from a 2008 article in the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition called “Alternatives for macronutrient intake and chronic disease.”1
The featured eating plans differ wildly from each other; just look at Ornish 
(75 carbs-7 fat-8 protein) compared with Mediterranean (46 carbs-38 fat-
16 protein). Each specially designed diet seems to spawn another one. I’ve 
often wondered why no one has invented the “Symmetrical Diet” or “Perfect 
Synchronicity” involving an exact partition of calories for all three macronu-
trients: 33-33-33. Not catchy enough? Or maybe I just haven’t looked hard 
enough; it must be out there.

American Heart Association Therapeutic Lifestyle (AHA TLC) guidelines (5), and typical 
US macronutrient intakes as reported in the third Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III; 24). The eating patterns are ordered with the highest-carbohydrate diet 
starting on the left and the lowest on the right. The Atkins diet profile is for the life-long 
maintenance phase, and the South Beach diet profile is for phase 3. Small amounts of al-
cohol (0.2–0.8% of energy) were also present in the Ornish, Mediterranean, Atkins, Zone, 
and South Beach diets. Percentages may not add up to 100% because of rounding.
If the numbers begin looking more and more like the offerings of a rou-
lette wheel, then maybe constantly pondering and switching between 
them is equivalently meaningful to playing casino games with your food. 
Meanwhile, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, a 
US public health authority, has produced its own guidelines involving MRs. 
They are called Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs). 
The AMDR is a “range of intake for a particular energy source that 
is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing 
intakes of essential nutrients.” See www.iom.edu/Global/News%20

Macronutrient Ratios
Chapter 3

These are ranges of percentages that the Food and Nutrition Board of the 
Institute of Medicine recommends for each macronutrient, as follows: carbs, 
45 to 65 percent for all age groups; fat, 20 to 35 percent depending on age; 
and protein, 10 to 35 percent. These numbers leave room for all kinds of 
diets, including ones dominated by carbs (65 percent), even though the 
accompanying comments point out that “the higher range” of carb intake 
leaves you open to high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. 
For example, based on these recommendations, you could have a diet that 
is 65 percent carbs-20 percent fat-15 percent protein, or one that goes in a 
dramatically different direction: 45 carbs-30 fat-25 protein. In other words, 
there’s a lot of wiggle room within the conventional wisdom.
RDAs
The US public health authorities also publish Recommended Dietary 
Allowances (RDAs) for each macronutrient (such as the RDA for carbohy-
drates—130 grams per day for adults). 
You’re probably familiar with the RDAs for vitamins and minerals. They are 
essentially a suggested “minimal amount for health.” For example, the RDA 
for carbs is based on the brain’s need for glucose.2
Your brain accounts for around 5 percent of your body 
weight, but grabs about 20 percent of your calories—
mainly glucose, but also ketones, a byproduct of metab-
olizing fats for energy. That’s a very impressive, “greedy” 
detail of our metabolism; if you take in 3,200 calories per 
day, your brain is getting about 640 calories. We’ll dis-
cuss ketones at the end of the chapter.
Now we’re going to move into a discussion about each of the three macro-
nutrients. 
Food molecules are like Legos. They are small molecules bonded or stuck 
together to make more complex ones. Starch, for example, is a big polymer 
or chain containing many monomers, which are glucose or sugar molecules. 
When you eat and digest these substances, the digestive enzymes split apart 
the connections between the pieces and separate them so that they can be 
absorbed into the body through the small intestine. 
The small intestine cannot absorb whole protein, carb polymer, and fat 
molecules; they all have to be split up by digestive enzymes first, so the sub-
stances you are actually absorbing are glucose and other sugar monomers, 
amino acids (from proteins), and fatty acids (from triglycerides, the storage 
form of fat).
Carbs are polymers of glucose molecules. Proteins are made up of an often-
complex configuration of amino acids. Fats, when you eat them in food,

are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acids in an “E” 
shape. These are the original Lego structures.
What About Coffee?
If you’re like me, coffee is almost a major 
macronutrient for you. But can you stay 
fit drinking a lot of coffee? It depends 
what you define as a lot. A moderate 
amount—a couple of cups or a to-go 
mug early in the day—is probably harm-
less. In fact, many studies say it's good 
for you.
Coffee is metabolized very quickly and 
obviously is stimulatory for the central 
nervous system. Caffeine is actually considered a kind of 
supplement for athletes. As we discuss in Chapter 10, a 
strong cup of coffee or tea is a suitable supplement before 
a sprint, a weightlifting session, or even a longer event. Caf-
feine mobilizes free fatty acids and acts as a central nervous 
system stimulant.
People who drink coffee seem to have “reductions in the 
risk of several chronic diseases,” according to “Coffee and 
Health: A Review of Recent Human Research,” a 2006 article 
in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition. Coffee actu-
ally contains some micronutrients in small amounts, such as 
the all-important mineral magnesium.
Coffee’s downsides? The obvious jitteriness you get from 
too much caffeine and too little kicking up of the heels. 
Coffee also decreases the heart rate (in my own experience, 
my resting heart rate (RHR) might go from 52 to 46 or lower 
after a few cups of joe) and increases blood pressure—so if 
you’ve got a little hypertension, coffee might not be a great 
thing. 
Coffee is also very addictive (with its own withdrawal 
symptoms—people talk about headaches, but I haven’t 
experienced them because I haven’t withdrawn yet), like 
that other bean, chocolate. Coffee will really mess with your 
sleep, and people differ in their sensitivity to it. Try drinking 
a big mug after 3:00 PM and see what it does to your sleep 
waves on a Zeo chart; you might have less REM or deep 
sleep, or you might simply have less sleep.
Given the number of studies they’ve conducted on coffee 
and caffeine, “the most popular drug in the world,” it seems 
like researchers have had plenty of opportunities to find 
something really bad about it, and so far they haven’t. As 
long as they don’t, I’m going to continue to enjoy my morn-
ing dark roast.
See the “Coffee and Health” review article at www.tandfon-
line.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408390500400009. 
We’ll start our more specific introduction to food chemistry with carbs.
Carbohydrates
Carbs, or carbohydrates, seem to always be discussed as “high” or “low,” 
but never quite in between. The latest rage is “low carb.” When I was fuel-
ing long-distance races in my cardio endurance days, it was high carb with 
adequate protein, but keep fats low. The bodybuilders, no matter what else 
was happening, seemed less fat-phobic, drinking their eggs and guzzling 
their whole milk along with everything else they consumed.
The carbs range from the simple (sucrose or table sugar) to the complex 
(starch). The simplest building blocks of carbs are monosaccharides, single-
unit molecules such as glucose, fructose, and galactose. 
These molecules are rarely consumed in food as-is; they are the products of 
digestion that are absorbed from the small intestine into the bloodstream 
or liver (in the case of fructose). In other words, glucose and the others are

usually connected together into disaccharides (two-unit sugars) or more 
complex food molecules called oligosaccharides (bigger-than-two-unit sug-
ars resulting from the breakdown of complex polysugars). Polysaccharides 
are the most complex sugars, like starch or cellulose.
Figure 3-4 shows a sucrose molecule, which is what the table sugar you 
might sprinkle into your tea or coffee is made of. Sucrose is made up of a 
glucose molecule attached to a fructose molecule (so sucrose is actually 
about 50 percent fructose, which is worth keeping in mind if you want to 
reduce your daily fructose intake—see the sidebar titled “The Skinny on 
Fructose”). Every carbohydrate is made of a carbon “backbone” with hydro-
gen and oxygen molecules attached to it. This combination of molecules 
gives carbohydrates their name.
Figure 3-4. A glucose attached to a fructose equals a sucrose (source: http://www.
worldofmolecules.com/foods/); green is carbon, red is oxygen, and white is hydrogen
When my son was finished romping about a Vermont village on Halloween, 
2011, he returned with a bag full of sucrose (I’m imploring him to give a 
lot of it away, and/or make it last months…). When you eat candy like a 3 
Musketeers bar, that mush pile of addictively tasty sucrose makes it down 
to the small intestine, where the sucrose molecule has to be “cleaved” into 
smaller parts before the sugar or monosaccharides ever make it across the 
intestinal barrier to the bloodstream. 
Nutrients have transporters that ferry them to the great beyond across the 
intestinal surfaces; no sugars beyond the simple sugars or monosaccharides 
have these transporters. 
Every carbohydrate is made of  
a carbon “backbone” with 
hydrogen and oxygen  
molecules attached to it.

Carbohydrates
The sucrose molecules are split apart into glucose and fructose molecules 
with the aid of enzymes that are present in the small intestine. The enzyme 
in question for the 3 Musketeers bar is sucrase (the “-ase” suffix usually sig-
nals an enzyme, just like the “-ose” suffix means a sugar). Similarly, lactose, a 
dissacharide milk sugar, requires lactase to be digested, and maltose has its 
digestive companion maltase (hey, a sensible biochemical naming strategy!).
Major Sugar Buzz
The chocolate bar, the full-sized bar that I used to like to see in my own 
Halloween bag, contains 40 grams of sugar.3 This is about 160 calories that 
consists of 20 grams of glucose and 20 grams of fructose. 
Glucose goes into the bloodstream, where it can be utilized by the brain for 
energy, or taken up by the muscle cells or the liver to be reassembled into 
glycogen, a special starch that animals like us store for later use (more on 
starch coming right up). Excess carbs can and often are stored as fat, via the 
sultriest term ever invented for body-fat-making processes: de novo lipogen-
esis (DNL). DNL takes place in the liver as well as in peripheral storage depots 
for your fats, like around your hips.
The body has to get rid of excess glucose—in a way, dispose of it—because 
it’s toxic to cells in excess quantities. If your glycogen is already topped off 
(because you’ve eaten a lot of carbs, or you simply never use it up by moving 
around), so you don’t have room to store more glucose in the form of starch 
in your body, the sugar can be oxidized (burned as fuel) by skeletal muscle 
cells for energy. Or, the body can store the glucose as fat in the liver or adi-
pose tissue (other fat depots in the body). 
Glucose Is Energy Fuel, but Not by the Ton
If you cannot store or burn up the glucose you’ve consumed, you may have 
the beginnings of high fasting glucose, or excess sugars dissolved in your 
plasma or blood. This is why the typical doc’s office annual visit involves a 
test for fasting glucose, to determine if you’re metabolically handling sugar 
and associated hormones (e.g., insulin and leptin) okay. 
You can keep your blood-sugar metabolism out of the prediabetic 
range (measured by some medical associations or countries’ stan-
dards as a persistent fasting glucose level of 100 or more) by keeping 
your calorie and carb consumption within bounds—i.e., in line with 
your total energy expenditure. Intermittent fasting helps lower your 
fasting glucose levels (see Chapter 6).

The hepatic portal vein, a conduit of blood and nutrients to the liver, takes 
fructose, a simple sugar that is part of sucrose, to the liver to be metabolized 
and detoxified (see the sidebar titled “The Skinny on Fructose”).
Analyzing Your Carbs
You can determine the amount of fructose in food in the following manner: 
search for a food like a 12-ounce can of Sprite at NutritionData (http://nutri-
tiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3870/2). This little exercise demonstrates 
how you can analyze food on your own, among other things. Expand the 
NutritionData segment on the carbohydrates in the soda-can contents, as 
shown in Figure 3-5. 
This beverage contains about 33 grams, or 132 kcal, of sugar, and guess 
what? They give you a free refill. The carbs include 19,151 mg, or about 19.2 
grams, of fructose and 2,399 mg (2.4 grams) of sucrose. The sucrose, how-
ever, is about 50 percent fructose, so you can determine the total fructose 
quantity as follows: 19151 + (2399 / 2) = 20,350 mg, or 20.3 grams. 
Before you completely condemn and wipe your hands of soda, realize that a 
large cultivated apple also contains a notable quantity of fructose. 
Apples are generally cultivated to have, among other characteris-
tics, a large size and a sweet taste compared with the typical runty, 
tart apples growing in the wild. These characteristics of cultivation 
are usually a good thing, providing many people with fresh apples 
containing some antioxidants and vitamin C throughout the year. 
They are not a good development on the fructose front though, for 
reasons that are explained up ahead. Besides, eating small wild apples 
(admittedly hard to find for people who don’t live in the countryside) 
provides more antioxidants. The antioxidants are in the skin, and you 
have to eat more of the wild apples to get the same number of calories 
as you would from the large store-bought apples.
A large apple contains 4,617 mg of sucrose and 13,157 mg of fructose, 
according to NutritionData. Therefore, using our prior calculation, we 
see that it contains a total of 13,157 + (4,617 / 2) = 15,465mg, or about 
15.5 grams, of fructose. This is comparable to the amount of fructose in a 
12-ounce can of soda; however, the vitamin C content in an apple may help 
counter the negative health effects of excess fructose consumption.4
I don’t want to dissuade people from eating apples (I eat them, partic-
ularly when I can pluck them off a tree). But the point is that a fructose 
is a fructose is a fructose, whether it comes from a pretty apple laid 
out at the store or a can of soda.

The Skinny on Fructose
Many things in nature have a dose-response relationship—
they might be great when experienced or imbibed in a 
small dose, but bad when taken in a large dose. If you were 
being held captive by a pirate in a small room and eating 
creepy-crawlies off the floor to survive, getting some fresh 
fruit, including its fructose content, would be a great life-
sustaining thing. 
Even once you’ve been released, munching on some fresh 
fruit once in a while would be a good idea—at the very 
least, it would keep you from geting scurvy (caused by a 
severe vitamin C deficiency).
Apparently, though, consuming lots of fructose—the sim-
ple sugar or monosaccharide found in plants but more typi-
cally consumed in the form of table sugar or high-fructose 
corn syrup (HFCS)—can be very unhealthy, in fact toxic. 
In regular doses as low as 50, 70, to 100 grams5,6per day, 
fructose can induce insulin resistance (a precursor to other 
problems such as diabetes and obesity), chronic inflamma-
tion, weight gain around the abdomen, a fatty liver, excess 
uric acid, and other problems.7 Fructose appears similar in 
terms of its negative effect on the liver to booze or ethanol, 
its fermentation byproduct.8
Basically, seek to eliminate the consumption of fructose- or 
HFCS-containing sodas and numerous other processed 
foods, and you avoid munching on commercial apples or 
watermelon all throughout the day (although vitamin C 
does seem to diminish the not-so-good fructose effects). 
Lemons, for example, are a great source of vitamin C and 
low in fructose. Just keep in mind that it’s a dose-response 
relationship (everything in moderation).
Exercise also seems to help offset some of the bad meta-
bolic aspects of fructose.9
When you drink cow’s milk, part of what you consume is lactose, which is a 
sugar that is made of one part glucose and one part galactose.
One cup of whole milk contains about 13 grams of sugar, all of that in 
the form of 12,836 mg (or 12.8 grams) of lactose. The whole milk has 
a macronutrient ratio of 30-49-21, meaning that it is 49 percent fats. 
About 70 percent of its calories come from fat and protein (see http://
nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/69/2).
The lack of lactase, an enzyme that splits apart lactose into its digestible 
constituents of glucose and galactose in the small intestine, is commonly 
known as lactose intolerance. People with this common form of indigestion 
don’t get along with regular milk, often replacing it with soy milk.
The book The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry 
Harpending poses the theory that the human genetic mutation that 
allowed people to maintain lactase production after weaning, giv-
ing them the ability to digest the milk of other animals (not just their 
mom’s), was an important factor in the spread of Indo-European 
languages. They posited that drinking the milk made the people who 
originated these languages stronger nutritionally and allowed them 
to spread their influence. You really have to give this book points for 
originality!

Maltose is a disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules bonded 
together. When barley is malted during the brewing of beer, this process 
breaks down the barley starch into maltose. Yeast will later use this sugar 
to fuel its lifecycle, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide as byproducts.10
Polysaccharides, or Starches
Polysaccharides are many sugars bonded together, sometimes consisting of 
thousands of glucose monomers. In other words, they are big complex Lego 
structures of glucose and other molecules. This is why they are commonly 
referred to as complex carbohydrates. 
A complex carb is ultimately a big interconnected blob of sugar. When 
digested, it’s split apart into many glucose monomers and released 
relatively quickly into the bloodstream, at least in terms of its effect on 
your metabolism. Some complex carbs or starches, like potatoes and 
white bread, have a higher glycemic index—an old measure of the 
effect of foods on glucose and insulin spikes in the blood—than table 
sugar. A complex carb like brown rice does not contain any fructose, 
however, which is a good thing if you’re looking for more carbs but no 
more fructose. Fiber-containing complex carbs such as squash have 
an added advantage in that they beneficially feed the microbiota in 
your colon after their incomplete digestion in the small intestine.
Polysaccharides include the starches we eat, such as a banana or a baked 
potato; glycogen, the animal starch we store in our muscles and liver (as well 
as a few other less substantial stores); and cellulose, which we cannot digest 
but often are implored to chew down as fiber.
Ruminant animals or herbivores like grazing cows, sheep, goats, bison, 
moose, and elk have specially designed stomachs that use microor-
ganisms to ferment cellulose, whether it be grass or sticks or twigs or 
weeds, into a digestible substance, which is eventually absorbed by 
their systems as short-chain fatty acids. So, while they are herbivores 
or plant eaters, they have a high-fat diet!
We can digest starch because we have the enzyme amylase in our saliva, as 
well as in the pancreatic juices that help break the starch down in our small 
intestines. Amylase helps break up starch into maltose, the double-glucose 
sugar, and maltase takes care of the rest of the job so the glucose can be 
absorbed into the bloodstream.11

Protein
Protein is a critical structural and functional component of the human body, 
and commonly represents anywhere from 10 to 30 percent of a person’s daily 
caloric intake. If you have a 2,400-calorie diet and 25 percent of it comes from 
protein, you’re getting 600 calories, or 150 grams, of that macronutrient.
The ability of the body to properly metabolize protein foods diminishes at an 
intake of about 35 percent of calories, which is why you are not advised to go 
crazy on protein intake and try to get the majority of your calories from it. A 
potentially fatal condition known as “rabbit starvation syndrome” can occur 
with a diet dominated by lean protein and deprived of fats and carbs. 
Early American explorers and pioneers discovered that dependence in the 
wilderness on meat that didn’t contain enough fat, like rabbits, caused nau-
sea, diarrhea, and sometimes death.12 
Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the famous Arctic explorer from Canada (he ended 
up his exciting life as Director of Polar Studies at Dartmouth in Hanover, 
New Hampshire), also commented on the ill effects and futility of trying 
to survive on skinny animals in the far north with the Inuit. He spent a few 
years living with the Inuit on Arctic expeditions about 100 years ago, and his 
writings and self-experiments cast light on the Inuit’s, and our own, ability to 
live almost exclusively for months on meat and fat. His book My Life with the 
Eskimos can be found at http://www.amzn.to/My-Life-Eskimo.
Where did the Inuit derive their vitamins, such as C, on this seal- and 
whale-meat diet? “Fediuk [analyzed] the vitamin C content of 100-
gram (3.55-ounce) samples of foods eaten by Inuit women living in 
the Canadian Arctic: Raw caribou liver supplied almost 24 milligrams, 
seal brain close to 15 milligrams, and raw kelp more than 28 milligrams.”13

Proteins Do Important Stuff
The body requires protein in big and small ways. Human genes are essential-
ly recipes for creating proteins. Skeletal muscle incorporates proteins called 
myosin and actin; bones are about one-fifth composed of the protein col-
lagen, which dominates connective tissue such as ligaments and tendons. 
Organ tissue, the gut, skin, hair (keratin), and blood vessels also contain 
structural proteins.
Proteins are also functional; they do important stuff. Examples of the func-
tional proteins are hormones that are made of protein (including glucagon, 
insulin, and growth hormone), immune system cells such as antibodies, 
enzymes (the catalysts for the body’s chemical reactions, and used in diges-
tion itself), as well as red and white blood cells. Figure 3-6 shows a hemo-
globin molecule, a protein complex in red blood cells that carries oxygen 
throughout the body. 
Proteins are like Lego structures, but this time the Lego pieces are amino 
acids, the protein’s building blocks. The body can build thousands of dif-
ferent proteins using numerous combinations of these almost two dozen 
ingredients. 
The body synthesizes from 500 to 1,000 pounds of protein, depending 
on the person's size, during a lifetime!14 
Here is some nomenclature involving proteins: 10 or more amino acids stuck 
together form a polypeptide (and two are a dipeptide and three a tripeptide). 
A polypeptide with more than 50 amino acids is called a protein, which can 
be composed of as many as 10,000 amino acids.15
Proteins have to be broken down into their constituent amino acids to be 
digested. This happens first in the stomach and then in the small intestine, 
employing a number of enzymes, including peptidases, proteases, and 
trypsin.16 The protein building blocks, the amino acids, make their way to 
the liver (where some are actually metabolized for energy), then into the 
bloodstream, where the cells take them up to help make more proteins.17

From a Programmer, The Hacker’s Diet
We interviewed John Walker, 
who wrote The Hacker’s Diet, 
founded Autodesk, Inc., and 
coauthored the AutoCAD 
software. He lives in Switzerland, 
and we conducted our email 
interview in November 2011.
When did you write the ‘The Hacker’s Diet’ book?
The book was written in 1989–1990. It circulated as samiz-
dat PostScript and PDF files until 1994, when the first web 
edition was released. There have been two subsequent 
web editions in 1994 and 2005, all with essentially the same 
content but improved formatting and navigation as HTML/
XHTML has evolved. An EPUB edition was released in 2011.
I gather you’ve approached the issue of losing weight using an 
engineer’s perspective. What is the crux of the strategy?
To lose weight, eat fewer calories than you burn; to gain 
weight, eat more calories than you burn.
The slope of a moving average trend line of daily weights 
provides an accurate measure of calorie balance.
A pound of fat is equivalent to around 3,500 calories, so if 
you have a 500-calorie-per-day deficit, you’ll lose about a 
pound a week.
What is the importance of tracking, metrics, and tools in your 
system? What other concepts are used that a developer might 
be familiar with (e.g., design patterns)?
In my view the flaw in most diet plans is that they are “open 
loop”—they prescribe a regimen of food and exercise, 
but provide no means to adapt to the differences among 
individuals and changes in circumstances. In The Hacker’s 
Diet, feedback is integral to the concept, as illustrated by 
the figure at the start of this chapter: www.fourmilab.ch/
hackdiet/e4/losingweight.html.
Daily tracking and plotting of the trend both eliminates 
much of the psychological rollercoaster of weight loss 
and management, and also allows one to adapt when 
circumstances change long before a problem gets out 
of hand, even if you don’t understand the cause of the 
change. For example: www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/ar-
chives/2006-07/000726.html.
The main concepts used in the system and the tools are:
• Exponentially smoothed moving averages as a means 
of low-pass filtering out of day-to-day noise in weight 
measurements (largely due to water retention).
• A linear regression fit to the smoothed trend line to 
determine its slope, from which calorie balance and 
rate of weight loss or gain can be calculated.
• A feedback system which adjusts meal plans based 
upon the measured calorie balance to achieve the 
desired rate of weight loss and permanent mainte-
nance of weight when the goal is achieved.
I’ve written a bit in this book on ancestral health and “Paleo.” 
Do you think these concepts have a place in a health regimen?
I have been experimenting with my own flavor of Paleo 
since December 2010 and have, so far, been very impressed 
with the results, particularly in blood pressure and cho-
lesterol levels. I believe that both the evolutionary and 
biochemical arguments for Paleo are credible, and that 
people concerned with health and longevity should seri-
ously consider it.
That said, while some people report weight loss after 
switching to Paleo, you certainly don’t need to adopt Paleo 
to lose weight—as long as you manage your calorie bal-
ance, it doesn’t matter what you eat. It may (and almost 
certainly will) be easier to lose weight if you eat a well-
balanced diet of healthy food, but the main reason to do so 
is better health, not weight management in itself.
Do you have any favorite tools or gadgets?
I’m a software guy, so I’m not particularly into gadgets and 
gizmos. I am a great believer in Donald Knuth’s practice of 
“Literate Programming,” and use his CWEB/CTANGLE tools 
for C/C++ programming and Nuweb for development in 
Perl and other languages. The entire source code for my 
2007 online set of tools for The Hacker’s Diet is published in 
Literate Programming form: www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/

Essential Amino Acids
Proteins are composed of any of 20 amino acids, 10 of which are considered 
essential because they have to be obtained in your diet. The body cannot 
synthesize its necessary proteins if these 10 amino acids do not show up 
in adequate amounts in your diet: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, 
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine, as well as arginine (for 
infants) and histidine (for infants) (from Human Anatomy & Physiology, by 
Elaine Marieb and Katja Hoehn).
Exercise Physiology, by William McArdle et al., lists only eight amino 
acids as “essential,” and points out that infants cannot synthesize histi-
dine and children have “a reduced capability for synthesizing arginine.” 
The rest of the 20 amino acids are: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cyste-
ine, glycine, glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, serine, and tyrosine.
Eating Protein
When you eat protein-containing foods such as meats, fish, eggs, cheese, 
nuts, and plant foods, as we mentioned, proteases and other enzymes split 
up the big block of Legos into their separate amino acids, which can then be 
absorbed in the small intestine and released to the liver and bloodstream. 
The body can do a number of things with these amino acids, depending on 
your physical needs: 
• The cells can take them up and use them as raw ingredients for proteins.
• The liver can make glucose out of them for energy purposes, in a pro-
cess called gluconeogenesis.
• They can also be stored, after conversion by the liver to glucose or lipids, 
as glycogen (i.e., muscle fuel) or fat. 
Yes, both excess carbs and excess protein in the diet can be stored as 
excess fat.
Proteins that are already in the cells (not coming in as part of your food) are 
constantly being degraded or split up into their constituent amino acids 
and resynthesized into new proteins the body needs. It’s a very complicated 
and ingenious metabolic process by which the liver finds so many different 
uses for proteins and amino acids, but one of the important elements of the 
sequence is that when the liver has to metabolize amino acids (in order to 
make glucose out of them, for example), the organ breaks down the amino 
acids into ammonia, which is converted to urea and excreted out via the 
kidneys in the urine. 

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs 
65
Protein
Ammonia is toxic when it builds up in the blood, which makes the 
excretion of urea throughout the day so important. The rate at which 
this conversion takes place in the liver is limited, which is why the body 
cannot tolerate unlimited amounts of protein, as in “rabbit starvation 
syndrome.”18
Cells can take up the amino acids for their own use, such as new protein 
synthesis by muscle cells.
An iPhone and Android app exists for amino acid aficionados, appro-
priately called Amino Acid Reference.
If you aim for optimal health, you need to get all of the essential amino acids 
in high enough quantities from your diet. Meat and fish eaters have an easier 
time of it than vegetarians, for instance, because these meat constituents are 
generally complete proteins—they have all of the essential amino acids in 
greater than trace amounts. Eggs are a great source of essential amino acids 
for vegetarians (eat copious amounts of pastured eggs), as is the occasional 
whey protein shake (see Chapter 10 for more details on sports nutrition).
Fermented Soy as a Small Protein Source
Ever tried tempeh, miso, or natto? If you’re Asian, Indone-
sian, or a vegetarian/vegan, your answer will probably be 
“Yes.” These are fermented soy products: the first originated 
in Indonesia, and the last two are well-known Japanese 
foods. They are part of a long lineage of traditional Eastern 
foods that consist of soy-based protein that is fermented; 
this removes most of soy’s nasty antinutrients, which 
prevent the absorption of minerals and protein (see the 
“Antinutrients” section in Chapter 4). Natto’s a really good 
source of vitamin K. These are also decent soy-based pro-
tein sources, albeit in small amounts.
You get the protein, without the meat fats, if you so desire. 
I’ve been adding tempeh to my salads, and liking it. It has 
the consistency of a softer cheese, and tastes a bit like 
bland meat. It’ll soak up sauces and dressing if you add it to 
salads or soups (miso is often made into a soup, such as at 
Japanese and Thai restaurants). 
So how does tempeh look, for example, as a protein source? 
It’s a complete source of protein, about 5 grams in a 28-gram 
serving. Tempeh is actually a high-fat food when you come 
right down to it, having a macronutrient ratio of 20 percent 
carbs-47 percent fat-33 percent protein (now that you’re an 
expert on MRs!). Four ounces, or about 112 grams, of tem-
peh contains a lot of Omega 6 fat and has a poor n-6:n-3 
ratio of more than 10 to 1. It’s a decent source of vitamins 
and minerals.19
Natto has a similar profile, but is more nutritious in terms 
of vitamins/minerals and has an almost equal amount of 
protein compared with tempeh, with the same problem of 
an unfavorable Omega 6 to 3 ratio (in the form that must 
be converted, unfortunately at a low rate, to the long chain 
versions that our bodies really need).20 
To show you how to analyze food for its protein quality, we’ll do a quick 
check of lamb, salmon, and bananas with NutritionData. This searchable web 
database for nutrition information has a good section on its result pages for 
protein. Figure 3-7 shows the page for a small slab of cooked lamb, which 
the site gives a good protein score (anything over 100 is a complete protein).

Figure 3-7. Lamb gets a good protein score
Many of the amino acids are in lamb in a quantity in excess of a gram, and 
the four ounce piece of meat has 26 grams of protein, a bit less than a quar-
ter of what a training athlete would need in a day. Salmon is also an excellent 
source of amino acids, as Figure 3-8 shows. A six ounce filet has about 40 
grams of protein, with more than 3 grams of the important muscle-building 
amino acid leucine. It also has more than 300 mg of tryptophan, an important 
biochemical precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, as 
well as the hormone melatonin.
Tryptophan in food may help make you sleepy before bedtime, 
because serotonin has a calming effect, and melatonin is a hormone 
that plays a role in sleep regulation.

Protein
The absorption during digestion of amino acids is quite slow—any-
where from 3 to around 10 grams per hour (that’s only 12 to 40 
calories per hour), depending on how much you weigh and whether 
the protein has a fast (whey protein) or slower (raw eggs) absorption 
rate—compared with fats (about 14 grams per hour) and carbs (60 
to 100 grams per hour, in terms of a glucose drink). So, if you eat 40 
grams of protein, your body may take about eight hours to absorb 
and utilize the amino acids.21
Just for the sake of comparison, let’s check out the amino acid content of a 
starch: bananas. A banana actually contains all the amino acids, but in very 
small amounts: less than 100 mg each (a large banana, after all, provides just 
1.5 grams of protein). As shown in Figure 3-9, though, the banana scores 
more than 30 grams of carbs, including over 6 grams of glucose and fruc-
tose, and even a little maltose.
Figure 3-9. A large banana chalks up the carbs on NutritionData
A medium-sized sweet potato has 1/10th the glucose and fructose of 
a large banana. A banana is a good source of potassium, however, so 
that’s the trade-off.

Fats

Fats
Fats, or fatty acids, are an important macronutrient both for food intake and 
as a source of energy when you are not eating and generating energy from 
your own stored tissue. Fats are also important because they contain fat-
soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K, as well as other nutrients. 
I use the mnemonic device “a deck of cards” to remember the vitamins 
in fats: ADEK, or “a deck.” Not bad, huh?
Many fat-containing foods also contain protein and/or carbs; in fact, it’s 
quite common to get all three macronutrients in your food. 
We get our fats from a variety of foods, including dairy (e.g., butter, whole 
milk, cheese), veggies like avocados and olives, meat, fish, nuts, coconut 
oil, nut butters, and oils (olive, peanut, coconut, etc.). Later in the chapter, 
we’ll take a closer look at the fat content of certain foods using our trusty 
NutritionData tool.
The form in which fats are both stored and eaten is called a triglyceride. This 
is an E-shaped molecule with a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty 
acids, as Figure 3-10 depicts.
Figure 3-10. A triglyceride molecule (source: http://www.reducetriglycerides.com/reader_
triglyceride_molecules.htm) 
The body also contains fats in the form of phospholipids in cell mem-
branes, cholesterol (which is crucial for synthesizing steroid hormones 
and making vitamin D in the skin), and other less substantial forms, 
but the vast majority of fat is stored in lipocytes, or fat cells, in the 
body’s fat depots such as adipose tissue and muscles.
Each one of the three fatty acids in a triglyceride is a hydrocarbon chain 
(often just described as a chain of carbon atoms) that is liberated at diges-
tion and eventually released to the bloodstream. In other words, after you 
consume an animal or a plant fat (veggies also contain fats!), the simplified 
version is this: an enzyme called pancreatic lipase splits up the triglyceride 
into separate molecules, including the three fatty acids, so that they can 
be absorbed in the small intestine (a triglyceride cannot be absorbed in its 
present bulky state). 

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs 
69
Fats
When the body stores fats, they are reassembled into triglycerides, and 
when you metabolize fats for energy, they are split up (yet again, just as in 
digestion) and are transported by proteins in the form of free fatty acids 
(FFAs) in the blood. Somewhat similar to the other macronutrients, the FFAs 
are the Lego pieces that can be fit together into the triglyceride structures, 
along with the glycerol molecule. Figure 3-11 shows an FFA called lauric acid, 
a shorter-chain fat with 12 carbons in its chain.
Figure 3-11. Coconut milk and human breast milk contain lauric acid (source: http://www.
worldofmolecules.com) 
The body can store fats in a waterless environment, and therefore 
they are a more efficient, lightweight storage medium for a human’s 
onboard energy. We each store about 100,000 calories' worth of 
fat. Carbohydrates have an affinity for water, on the other hand, 
and therefore weigh more, including the water, as stored glycogen. 
It would take about 67 pounds of stored glycogen to represent the 
equivalent energy of 10 pounds of stored fat!22 This must be one of the 
reasons that we only store about 1,200 to 2,000 calories' worth of gly-
cogen, our own starch.
Free fatty acids have common names like lauric or stearic acid, along with 
a numbered symbolic notation, such as 12:0. This means that lauric acid, 
a saturated fat, has 12 carbon atoms and 0 double bonds along its chain. 
Before your eyes glaze over with this reminder of geeky Mr. Taylor’s Chem 
101 class back in Wichita Falls, realize that the length of a fatty acid chain is 
always even, and represents a good geek detail for understanding fat nutri-
tion. We promise!
SatFats vs. PolyFats
A saturated fat (satFat, my abbreviation) is a molecule that has a straight, 
noncurvy orientation (without the “kinks” or double bonds of the other fats). 
This orientation allows the satFats to fit together snugly and remain solid at 
room temperature (like cheese, or butter, before they get moldy and rancid!). 

Fats
Chapter 3
70
On the other hand, a polyunsaturated fat (polyFat) has more than one double 
bond along its carbon chain (which is where the poly prefix comes from). 
This creates a bend, or kink, in the molecule. That structural aspect keeps 
polyFats liquid at room temperature.
A polyunsaturated fat that is much discussed for its health benefits, an 
Omega 3, is called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
Forget it, don’t even try to pronounce it.
EPA has a notation that looks like 20:5, n-3, indicating that this fatty acid 
has 20 carbon atoms and 5 double bonds, and that the first double bond is 
located three carbons in from the Omega end of the chain (i.e., at the end 
of the “toes” of the E-shaped structure, rather than at the location where the 
fatty acid chains connect with the glycerol molecule). 
Only a food chemist really wants to practice memorizing these com-
plicated notations. You can impress your friends, however, by calmly 
explaining to them the difference between saturated and polyunsatu-
rated fat; one’s kinky!
A monounsaturated fat (monoFat), like the oleic acid in olive oil, has only one 
double bond in the molecule.
Eating Fat
To sum up, the various fats in your food arrive in the form of saturated, 
monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fats, and often a mixture of all three 
of these substances.
Olive oil, which you can use in your homemade salad dressing, contains the 
following types of fats: monoFats (about 75 percent); satFats (about 14 per-
cent), and polyFats (about 11 percent).23 Olive oil’s principal monounsatu-
rated fatty acid is an 18-carbon chain fat called oleic acid.
Olive oil is a liquid at room temperature. The higher the number of 
double bonds in the fat’s chemistry, the more likely it will be a liquid at 
room temperature. Animal fats tend to contain more monounsaturat-
ed (one double bond) and saturated fats, and thus tend to be solid at 
room temp. Vegetable oils, true to their name, are only usually liquid 
at room temp and contain more polyunsaturated fats.24

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs 
71
Fats
The health advice for eating fat can be summed up this way: eat a reasonable 
amount of monounsaturated fats, as in olive oils, avocados, and macadamia 
nuts, as well as fish and many meats, and try to even out the ratio between 
Omega 6 fats and Omega 3s (subsets of the polyFat; see the “Omega 6 vs. 
Omega 3 Fat Ratio” section). 
Saturated fats have recently had the air let out of their tires as the demon 
of your diet (see the “Saturated Fat Has Some of the Air Let Out of Its Tires” 
sidebar on related scientific studies and opinions), so we don’t have to be 
so phobic about them. They might even have anti-inflammatory effects for 
some people, particularly if you’ve replaced a lot of simple carbs or sugars 
with them.
Coconut milk is fine, as are high-quality cheeses and grass-fed meats, and 
the satFats you get in the small chunks of the 100-percent high-cacao choco-
late I eat (addictively) are acceptable and healthy additions to the diet. 
Figure 3-12 shows all the other fats (some in trace amounts) that olive oil 
contains, from the handy NutritionData tool. A teaspoon of olive oil is 100 
percent fat by calories, with 5 grams totaling about 45 calories (9 calories per 
gram, because it’s a fat!). 
This is how you can find out the fat content of your food: do a search at 
NutritionData, then scroll down to the boxed area reserved for Fats & Fatty 
Acids. This shows that a teaspoon of olive oil also contains almost half a gram 
(439 mg) of linoleic acid, or Omega 6 fats, a subset of polyFats. There’s the 
oleic acid: “18:1 undifferentiated”—more than three grams of it.
I told you those fat notations could get pretty geeky!
Rather than just a teaspoon of oil, let’s analyze the fat content of typical fare 
for an American Friday night: a large pizza slice with pepperoni. The dish 
sounds delectable, but, like all of life’s vicissitudes, that dinner’s nutritional 
profile is likely to be a mixture of joy and regret.

How Does the “Paleo” Diet Measure Up?
There’s been an explosion of Romantic Primitivism in 
Western culture. It must have something to do with how 
moribund the so-called benefits of modern civilization have 
become (you can only spend so much time in cubicles star-
ing at screens with cell phones plastered to your ear). 
Just look at how popular escapist journeys into the back-
country or the outback and Burning Man have become. 
Every region now boasts multiple weekend races where 
the participants are required to mimic the opening scene 
of the film Gladiator, beating their bare chests, shaking 
toy spears, and sprinting off with war cries into the woods. 
The nutrition counterpart of this Spartan movement is the 
Paleolithic, or Paleo, diet, which is making a comeback after 
about 50,000 years.
The Paleo diet is a delicious combination of meats, fish, 
veggies (e.g., tubers like sweet potatoes), fruits (mostly 
of the berry kind), nuts, and “offal” (not awful!), as in bone 
marrow and liver pate. I had a bison heart recently from the 
Full Circle Bison Ranch in southern Oregon; it was delicious 
and nutritious (marinated in balsamic vinegar and spices, 
then baked for a while on a low temperature). Many people, 
like myself, add dairy to Paleo, as in whole milk, cheese, and 
eggs (the real Paleo diet most likely included bird’s eggs, 
but certainly no cheese or cow’s or goat’s milk). 
The Paleo diet has measured up quite well lately in the few 
studies that have compared it with other dietary regimens, 
according to a 2010 journal wrap-up.25 Here are a few 
quotes from the article:
A randomized controlled trial of 29 patients with 
ischemic heart disease and either glucose intoler-
ance or [Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus] (T2DM) were ran-
domized to 12 weeks of a Paleolithic (i.e., lean meat, 
fish, fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs, and 
nuts) or a Mediterranean-like Consensus diet based 
on whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegeta-
bles, fruits, fish, oils, and margarines. The Paleolithic 
group showed an improved glucose control and a 
greater decrease in waist circumference when com-
pared with the Consensus group.
Fifteen patients with T2DM were randomized to 
either a Paleolithic diet or a diabetes diet and then 
crossed over after 3 months. Patients were on each 
diet for 3 months. Compared with the diabetes diet, 
the Paleolithic diet produced lower mean levels of 
hemoglobin A1c, triacylglycerol, diastolic blood pres-
sure (BP), weight, body mass index (BMI), as well as 
waist circumference and higher mean serum high-
density lipoprotein levels.
Whether the Paleolithic diet will become a suitable 
prescriptive alternative remains to be determined 
by more extensive studies on a larger number of 
participants.
Lively discussions of the Paleo diet and its practitioners can 
be found on www.paleohacks.com and other websites.
It wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t indicate the whole lineup of macronutrients, 
including protein and carbs. Figure 3-13 from NutritionData shows the Fats 
& Fatty Acids results for a 14-inch pizza slice with pepperoni topping.
The pizza slice includes 12.1 grams of fats, or 109 calories, which happens to 
be 37 percent of the total 298 kcal. 
This is pretty high in calories for just one pizza slice. Multiple slices 
would obviously be a very energy-dense meal. Better be climbing a 
mountain the next morning, or better yet, back off from the slices and 
eat some blueberries.

Fats
The macronutrient ratio, the whole shebang, for the pizza slice is 46 percent 
carbs-37 percent fats-17 percent protein. You can assume that the vast 
majority of the carbs (and thus up to half of all the calories) came from the 
refined flour of the pizza crust. See the “Now for Something Completely 
Different on the Crust Front” sidebar for a recipe involving an alternative 
crust.
Now for Something Completely Different on the Crust Front
What follows is a recipe for pizza crust for when you want 
a break from the grains, wheat, and refined flour, but you 
still want to pile the fixings onto your pizza slices (recipe 
courtesy of www.girlgoneprimal.com).
1 large head of cauliflower
2 cups cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, or a combo of both)
2 eggs
Optional herbs (thyme, fennel, oregano, basil & parsley all 
work wonderfully)
Method:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. Line pan or pizza 
stone with baking paper.
Rice the cauliflower by putting florets into a food processor 
and buzzing until finely processed (but not mushy). Place 
cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl and zap for 6-8 
minutes. You should end up with about two cups of riced 
cauliflower.
Mix in cheese and eggs until smooth. Spread evenly over 
baking paper in a round shape. Sprinkle with herbs. Place 
in oven until golden on top and starting to crisp around the 
edges (around 15 minutes in my oven).
Remove from oven and add desired toppings. I used sliced 
tomato, sliced capsicum, mozzarella and parmesan cheese, 
mushrooms, and some meat (I only had salami). I choose to 
sprinkle cheese on the base, with the toppings rather than 
placing it between the base and the toppings (as directed 
in the original recipe). The cheese in the base helps keep 
the topping in place and connected to the base.
Place completed pizza back in the oven until the cheese 
melts and toppings are cooked to your preference. Cut and 
serve while hot. Also delicious reheated.
You can see that the pizza slice contains all three fatty-acid classifications. 
About 44 percent of the fats come from saturated fats (we can reasonably 
assume a lot of that comes from the cheese, since mozzarella cheese, for 
example, is about 58 percent saturated fat). 
The saturated fat isn’t necessarily bad (five grams or so, almost matched by 
a similar amount of monounsaturated fat) from a health standpoint, com-
pared with the refined carbohydrate represented by the pizza crust. 
Oh no, here it comes again, some glum preachy advice about not eat-
ing too much pizza! I’m imitating my son here, who’s heard enough 
from me about nutrition. He calls me, with a derisive tone, “Mr. 
Healthy Guy.”
The crust might contribute to the fat gains brought on by excessive energy-
dense foods. Just ease up on it, do yourself a favor.

Saturated Fat Has Some of the Air Let Out of Its Tires
When I was a young tyke soccer player, I used to eat bacon 
and eggs for breakfast. Then, the night before a game, my 
mother would make me a steak, and I used to eat the fat 
because it tasted good. Then I used to go out onto the 
field and run everyone’s butts off (and occasionally get my 
own tail kicked)—in other words, the ingredients for that 
training table seemed to work. I guess we’re supposed to 
conclude that I was dying of heart disease, then? Too much 
saturated fat in the eggs and steak?
Many of us have grown up with public-health guidelines 
that say to avoid saturated fats at all costs. Eat it, get a heart 
attack. Yet, it’s very easy these days to find dissenting or at 
least moderating opinions, including among health and 
nutrition experts. 
At the very least, you need fats to absorb fat-soluble 
vitamins: A, D, E, and K (“a deck of cards—ADEK”). And fats, 
including saturated, can be anti-inflammatory for some 
people, particularly if they replace more inflammatory 
foods.
The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published a study 
in March 2010 that cast doubt on whether the consumption 
of saturated fats is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease. Led by Dr. Ronald Krause of the Children’s Hospital 
Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA, the meta-analysis 
reviewed the results of 21 studies.
The review concluded that “there is insufficient evidence…
that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased 
risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD [cardiovascular disease].” The full 
review is available at www.ajcn.org/content/91/3/535.full. 
In a related opinion piece published in the same journal 
online in January 2010, the authors wrote:
The evidence that supports a reduction in satu-
rated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of 
replacement by other macronutrients. Clinical trials 
that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated 
fat have generally shown a reduction in CVD events, 
although several studies showed no effects. 
An independent association of saturated fat intake 
with CVD risk has not been consistently shown in 
prospective epidemiologic studies, although some 
have provided evidence of an increased risk in young 
individuals and in women. Replacement of saturated 
fat by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat low-
ers both LDL and HDL cholesterol. 
However, replacement with a higher carbohydrate 
intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, can exac-
erbate the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with 
insulin resistance and obesity that includes increased 
triglycerides, small LDL particles, and reduced HDL 
cholesterol. 
In summary, although substitution of dietary poly-
unsaturated fat for saturated fat has been shown 
to lower CVD risk, there are few epidemiologic or 
clinical trial data to support a benefit of replacing 
saturated fat with carbohydrate.
See the related Scientific American article at www.scientifi-
camerican.com/article.cfm?id=carbs-against-cardio and the 
opinion article itself at: www.ajcn.org/content/91/3/502.full. 
Omega 6 vs. Omega 3 Fat Ratio
Apparently, another piece of dietary-fat data to pay attention to is the ratio 
of Omega 6 to Omega 3 essential fatty acids. Here, with the pizza slice, it is 
1,749 mg to 188 mg, or about nine to one in favor of Omega 6. So what are 
Omega 3 and 6 fats, and why should you care about them?
Omega 3 and 6 fats are subsets of the polyunsaturated fats. They, in turn, are 
super-categories for a number of different Omega 3s and 6s, each with their 
own technical names. The two groups of fats are often referred to by the 
position of the first double bond in their molecules: n-3 and n-6. 

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs 
75
Fats
The first revealed essential fatty acids were called vitamin F until scientists 
decided, “Hey, they’re not really vitamins, they’re macronutrients—fats.”
Both n-3s and n-6s play a number of important roles in the body, including 
the provision of the raw ingredients for the biochemicals of the immune 
system called prostaglandins.26 Both fatty acids are used in the body’s cell 
membranes, and n-3s are particularly important for the developing brains of 
youngsters and babies, as well as the aging brains of us old coots.
We have to eat these essential Omegas because the body does not have the 
wherewithal to synthesize their long-chain versions, such as EPA (the unpro-
nounceable one) and DHA (another n-3 fat), as well as arachidonic acid, an 
n-6. Two food chemicals in our diets that are raw materials or precursors for 
these essential fatty acids are the shorter-chain fats linoleic acid, an n-6 fat, 
and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an n-3, or Omega 3 fat.
Bump up those n-3s
A biochemical the body needs called arachidonic acid is synthesized from 
linoleic acid (the n-6) using enzymes. Linoleic acid competes for the same 
enzymes that help make EPA and DHA (the two downstream n-3s our bodies 
require) from ALA. 
Too much n-6 in the diet, for example, will tend to ramp down the produc-
tion of the important EPA/DHA Omega3 nutrients, because they compete 
for the same enzymes. And thus the Omega 3s don’t make their way into 
cell membranes, brain matter, and other places where they do good work.
The western SAD diet contains too high a proportion of Omega 6 fats. It is 
easier to get n-6 fats than n-3s, particularly if you consume a lot of polyun-
saturated vegetable oils like corn, soy, or safflower oil (as in, things that are 
cooked in those oils), which are rich n-6 sources. 
A number of otherwise healthy foods, like eggs (15 to 1 ratio of n-6 to n-3; a 
pastured egg will have higher amounts of n-3s though), avocados (15 to 1; 
but you don’t want to stop eating avocados and lose all that healthy mono-
unsaturated fat), almonds (2,000 to 1, more than three grams n-6; but a very 
good source of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals), and walnuts (4 to 1, 
with most of the n-3 in the form of ALA), have unfavorable n-6 to n-3 ratios. 
Nutrition is often a trade-off between benefits, drawbacks, and uncer-
tainties involving the synergies of certain foods with others on the 
same plate. This is why it’s sensible to vary the types of food you eat, 
so you can attenuate or “hack out” any mistakes or imperfections in 
food choices. E.g., you don’t have to stop eating nuts like almonds or 
macadamias, but make sure that you are getting good sources of n-3s.

Fats
Chapter 3
76
Our genes are selected for closer to 1:1
Scientists have posed a theory that humans are genetically programmed 
for an Omega 6 to Omega 3 ratio of closer to 1:1. This is based on the differ-
ent composition of foods that our wild-eating Paleolithic forebears chowed 
down on (like seafood), as well as what they didn’t eat, like Burger King 
french fries and salad dressing made out of soy oil.
The french fries have an n-6 to n-3 ratio of about 30 to 1, but at least 
equally bad are the six grams of the Franken-lipid trans fatty acids, 
which you should never eat.27 
“Studies on the evolutionary aspects of diet indicate that major changes 
have taken place in our diet, particularly in the type and amount of essen-
tial fatty acids and in the antioxidant content of foods,” writes Dr. Artemis P. 
Simopoulos in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. “It has been esti-
mated that the present Western diet is ‘deficient’ in Omega-3 fatty acids with 
a ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 of 15-20/1, instead of 1/1 as is the case with 
wild animals and presumably human beings.”
An Omega 6 called conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA, appears to be 
pretty good for us. You can find it in grass-fed beef and pastured or 
free-range eggs, for example. See www.eatwild.com/healthbenefits.
htm and any CLA search on Google Scholar, such as http://scholar.
google.com/scholar?q=conjugated+linoleic+acid&hl=en&btnG=Sear
ch&as_sdt=1%2C46&as_sdtp=on. 
Omega 6 fats tend to be more inflammatory when overconsumed, and 
Omega 3 fats are anti-inflammatory in nature. So how do you help cor-
rect your own ratio so it falls more on the Omega 3 side? Eat rich sources of 
Omega 3 fats (including EPA/DHA) like seafood and shellfish every few days: 
salmon, arctic char, herring, sardines, tuna, mussels, mackerel, oysters, hali-
but, crab, and shrimp. 
Legitimately pastured eggs and meats are richer sources of Omega 3 than 
their industrially produced counterparts, but some of these foods can also 
be somewhat high in Omega 6 fats (e.g., even grass-fed beef has an n-6 to 
n-3 ratio of 4 or 5 to 1). 
You can get lots of servings of small but significant amounts of n-3 fats such 
as ALA from fresh veggies like broccoli (92 mg and a 4 to 1 ratio of n-3 to 
n-6). Even fruits like bananas and blueberries have small amounts of ALA. 
The conversion rate by the body of ALA to EPA and DHA (the building of a 
shorter-chain n-3 into a longer-chain one), however, is quite low: in men, as 
low as 8 percent of ALA is converted to EPA and 4 percent to DHA. 
Nutrition is often a trade-off 
between benefits, drawbacks, 
and uncertainties involving the 
synergies of certain foods with 
others on the same plate.

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs 
77
Fats
This means that if you eat eight grams of ALA, it converts into far less than a 
gram of EPA or DHA, the forms your body really needs. The conversion rate 
is higher in women, according to the Linus Pauling Institute’s description.28 
A tablespoon of caviar, or fish roe, wouldn’t you know it, is good for 
you, if not your wallet. It’s a good source of minerals and vitamin B12 
and has more than a gram of Omega 3 fatty acids, with about an 80 
to 1 ratio of n-3 to n-6 essential fatty acids. So if you run into a Russian 
fellow who wants to gift you his caviar container for that extra ticket 
to the Knicks game...29
It also helps to cut back on foods and oils that are rich in Omega 6, because 
as we mentioned, they are ubiquitous in the Western diet. Here’s a tiny but 
telling example: a small portion of wheat crackers, like the amount that 
I used to routinely eat (14 of them) contains almost a gram of Omega 6 
because they’re cooked in a vegetable oil like soy oil; they have an n-6 to n-3 
ratio of about 19 to 1.30
You have to watch out for nuts, too, and their Omega 6 content. A small por-
tion of macadamia nuts, however, has healthy monounsaturated fats and a 
5 or 6 to 1 n-6 to n-3 ratio—not too bad a trade-off. 
The foods richest in Omega 6, according to NutritionData, are various vege-
table oils (sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, soy), various types of mayonnaise 
(hold the mayo!), sunflower seeds, and fast-food sauces such as “creamy 
ranch” and “spicy buffalo.” 
Health Hack: Testing for Omega 3
You can actually test the Omega 3 content of your body fat, as another 
health hack. The tests examine the fat content of the cell membranes of red 
blood cells for its percentage of EPA and DHA. These cells turn over in the 
body every three to four months, so the tests are designed to determine 
your recent n-6 and n-3 consumption. There are commercial testers such as 
OmegaQuant or GeneSmart, or you could just ask your doctor to order the 
test.
Although potentially interesting, this is a very minor element of biomarker 
testing (I’ll probably indulge in this test one day anyway). It would be pretty 
meaningless unless you’d taken care of the major fitness issues first, like 
body weight, cutting back on refined sugar, inflammation, and a solid exer-
cise program. Most of the time, just upping your fish intake and backing off 
of industrial vegetable oils will give you the most bang for your buck in this 
arena. 

Ketones
Chapter 3
78
Ketones
We’ll conclude with a brief discussion of ketones, or ketone bodies, simply 
because they are elements of nutrition (particularly lower-carb approaches) 
and fasting that many people are curious, or simply bewildered, about these 
days. Ketones are also involved in fat metabolism.
The body has three nutrient pools that it calls upon to fuel itself: fats, carbs, 
and proteins, roughly in that order of magnitude. The heart and skeletal 
muscles don’t at all mind using fat for metabolic fuel; these are the free fatty 
acids that are liberated from our fat stores (triglycerides) or provided by the 
fats on our plate. At rest, our brains are usually hogging most of our glucose 
(they use up to 20 percent of our total energy). 
The mitochondria—the little power plants inside our cells, such as the skel-
etal muscle and heart muscle cells—can readily metabolize stored or dietary 
fat to produce our body’s energy. When resting, such as when we are sitting 
in a chair or sleeping, about 70 percent of our metabolic energy comes 
from burning fat. We appear to be designed for fat burning, given that fat 
represents the vast majority of our stored energy and is what we’re mostly 
burning when we’re not eating (in the “absorptive state”) or in a high-speed 
cycle or road race.
Our fat-metabolic machinery apparently cannot keep up with the 
high oxygen requirements of speedy endurance exercise (such as 
when hammering along at heart rates of 140 beats per minute or 
more)—otherwise, racers wouldn’t need “GUs” and PowerBars (basi-
cally concentrated sources of glucose) to keep them from bonking dur-
ing marathons and triathlons. See Chapter 10 for the skinny on sports 
nutrition.
When you’re taking part in an intermittent fast or are otherwise low on carbs 
(i.e., fasts of less than a day, very low-carb diets, and particularly during 
starvation), the liver reaches a fork in the road along its metabolic pathway 
for generating energy from fats. A chemical in the metabolic pathway called 
acetyl-COA builds up in the absence of another chemical that would usually 
be present in enough quantity if more carbs were around.31
The liver then generates another fuel source called ketones, out of the acetyl-
COA. The ketones enter the energy mix along with the fatty acids and the glu-
cose made from the amino acids harvested from muscles (gluconeogenesis). 
Ketones are an ancient biochemical among living things, a common energy 
substrate (babies are apparently born metabolizing a lot of ketones to keep 
things going, as their proportionately huge brains use 60 percent or more 
of their fuel). Ketones actually provide more calories per gram than glucose 
(about 4.76 calories per gram compared with glucose’s 4 per gram).32
At rest, our brains are usually 
hogging most of our glucose.

Food Chemistry Basics: Proteins, Fats, and Carbs

Ketones
The heart and brain can utilize ketones for energy, and as at least one scien-
tific study indicated, the heart uses energy more efficiently on them.33
A number of researchers and doctors have theorized that our bodies have 
evolved this ketone-utilizing pathway to preserve muscle and continue to 
fuel the brain during extreme swings of food availability and scarcity (if 
ketones are being burned, less muscle, which is necessary for moving your 
body around and surviving, has to be squandered making glucose out of 
amino acids).34
 “Fats are metabolized to ketone bodies, which replace glucose as a major 
fuel for the brain,” explained Dr. Thomas Seyfried, a professor at Boston 
College who has implemented studies of ketogenic diets, and who was 
interviewed for Chapter 6, our fasting chapter. “Ketone body metabolism 
reduces inflammation and enhances [the] metabolic efficiency of most cells.”
The next time I pick up some kind of virus, you can bet that I’m going to try 
to fast it out of me—have a lengthy tea fast, for example. Not that getting 
sick is the only reason to fast. My body will start burning ketones at a certain 
point for energy, and as long as the fast is working, this is not a development 
I’m particularly going to mind.

Tiny components can have huge effects. Even if you’re not a weather scien-
tist who embraces Chaos Theory (the flutter of a butterfly’s wings in Mexico 
changes weather patterns in America), you know a computer chip the size 
of a fingertip can contain millions of invisible gates, and the loss of that chip 
means that the seven-million-pixel Photoshop montage you’ve been work-
ing on for that DVD cover just vanished forever. 
The Nutrient That Roared
A seemingly innocuous glitch can bring down software programs compris-
ing hundreds of thousands of code lines. Ever heard of that impossible-to-
find “divide by zero” bug? Just because something is small doesn’t mean that 
its influence isn’t giant. Such is the case with the micronutrients in our diet. 
“Vitamins schmitamins,” you might say.
All you have to know is that the continuous deprivation of really tiny 
amounts of vitamins B1 (thiamine) and B3 (niacin) can give you nasty, poten-
tially fatal diseases called beriberi and pellagra, respectively. These diseases 
have been very common throughout human history.1 And these vitamins 
are recommended only in the micrograms per day.2
If your dinner was a beach, the B vitamins would be a palmful of sand.
Apples vs. Twinkies
What about vitamin C, which has been urged upon you ever since that 
apple banged around in active competition with the Twinkie inside your 
lunchbox? 
According to a 2004 study that tested thousands of Americans for their 
health status, up to 3 in 10 Americans have either a deficient (about 7 per-
cent of them) or marginal vitamin C status, meaning that if the C starvation 
continues, they could be a few months away from real scurvy symptoms3 
(see the sidebar “Vitamin C: Helps Keep Your Tissues and Fat-Burning 
Capabilities Intact”).

Full-blown scurvy is a potentially fatal and ghastly disease, involving 
bleeding from ruptured blood vessels, as well as the overall disintegra-
tion of collagen, the fibrous, bodily connective tissue found in tendons, 
ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, muscles, and veins. Vitamin C must 
be present for the synthesis of collagen, which is why you literally fall 
apart without it!
Now that I’ve mentioned it, a medium-sized apple contains about 8.4 mg of 
vitamin C (you need on average about 6 mg of vitamin C per day to avoid 
death!), so you need to go quite a bit farther than the apple to reach the RDA 
of 90 mg for men and 75 mg for women.
It’s a Snap to Keep Yourself Topped Up
The good news is that it’s generally very easy for the vast majority of people 
to get enough micronutrients via their diet alone (if you make the effort to 
educate yourself on food composition), or through a combination of food 
and supplements. 
You have to derive micronutrients from your diet and/or supplements, 
because the body cannot make most of them itself. In fact, we’ve evolved 
a love affair with plants due to that age-old drawback of not being able to 
synthesize life-giving chemicals like vitamin C or E as plants can (see the 
sidebars on vitamin C and antioxidants). 
You might recall this story: the British sailors keeled over with scurvy, but the 
cats on the ships survived, because they could synthesize their own vitamin 
C (thus the “Limeys” began eating fruit like vitamin C–containing lemons and 
limes to survive sea voyages).
What’s Ahead? 
People have a small but crucial requirement for vitamins or minerals in their 
food. An upcoming section explains the daily requirements for micronutri-
ents, which the Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. National Academy of 
Sciences establishes and calls Recommended Dietary Allowances, or RDAs.
Sometimes a doctor, or a friend, or the local guru who seems to have read 
every Asian philosopher and can walk anywhere barefoot, scratches his chin 
and says something like, “Maybe you should take more magnesium. . ."
Because it’s generally to your advantage to be able to distinguish mag-
nesium from vitamin C (for beginners, one’s a mineral and the other is a 
vitamin), this chapter will also provide brief descriptions of many of the key 
vitamins and minerals. 
Along the way, the chapter gives you tips on reading a vitamin Supplement 
Facts label, as well as sensible reasons to aim for some of the “super foods” 
like the tiny but mighty phytochemicals.

Micronutrients: Vitamins, Minerals, and Phytochemicals

Figuring Out Your Daily Micronutrient Requirements
The end of the chapter has a guide to a few of the online tools you can play 
with for analyzing your nutrient intake. After all, knowledge is power, espe-
cially self-knowledge. Your nutrient profile might begin as a sad story, but it’s 
going to end in triumph.
Let’s get some definitions out of the way first.
What Are Micronutrients?
A micronutrient is a tiny constituent of food or a biochemical that plays a 
vital role in basic physiology, such as a vitamin, a mineral, or a phytochemi-
cal—that is, a chemical made by plants, such as beta-carotene, lycopene (in 
tomatoes), or resveratrol (in grapes).
Macronutrients (discussed in Chapter 3) are the dietary components used 
for fuel and making things, and are thereby used up in the process: protein, 
carbohydrates, and fats. Micronutrients are used for chemical reactions 
(vitamins can be cofactors for enzymes) and/or stored in the body as part 
of its structure or chemistry (e.g., calcium and phosphorus in bone), or as 
antioxidant defenses (vitamins C, E, and the mineral selenium). 
Micronutrients are often measured in milligrams or micrograms. There are 
about 28 grams in one ounce; a single U.S. dollar bill weighs about 1 gram. 
A milligram (mg) is one thousandth of a gram. A microgram (mcg) is about 
one millionth of a gram.
Sodium chloride (salt), for example, is a “macromineral” that people eating 
Western diets typically get more than enough of from processed foods. A 
macromineral is usually required in the diet at a quantity of at least 100 mg 
or more per day, but all of our descriptions will mention specific RDAs along 
the way. 
To picture a milligram, imagine one grain of salt out of a saltshaker. Some of 
the trace or “microminerals” we list in this chapter, like iodine or selenium, 
along with B vitamins, for example, are only recommended in a few mg per 
day, or in some cases, a few micrograms. 
Figuring Out Your Daily Micronutrient 
Requirements
As in the user-testing and bug-tracking tools of the software world, you have 
to have some kind of metric to determine whether you’re getting enough of 
a micronutrient or not. You may know you’re getting 50 mg of vitamin C per 
day, but then what? Is that too much, not enough, or adequate for your age 
or gender?
In the U.S., the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of 
Sciences has set the daily requirements for vitamins and minerals. They 
call them Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), and they are usually 
A micronutrient is a tiny constit-
uent of food or a biochemical

expressed in milligrams or micrograms. The RDAs are the amounts of the 
chemicals that will keep you out of deficiency for that vitamin or mineral 
(meaning, they are not maximum intakes by any means). They are part of 
a larger rubric called Dietary Reference Intakes, or DRIs (see the end of this 
section for an explanation of the “dietary alphabet soup”). 
Some of the vitamin recommendations are in International Units (IU), such 
as for vitamins A and D. 
To convert from IUs to micrograms, for vitamin D: 1 IU = 0.025 mcg (so 
40 IU vitamin D = 1 mcg). For vitamin A: 1 microgram = 3.33 IUs.
An RDA is pretty easy to understand: for example, 90 mg of vitamin C for 
male adults and 75 mg per day for female adults.
The RDAs are not generally hard to meet by eating whole foods such 
as fruits and vegetables, but that hasn’t prevented the vast majority of 
Americans—more than 90 percent of us—from falling short of the require-
ments, according to Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg, the director of the Antioxidants 
Research Laboratory at Tufts’ Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research 
Center on Aging. 
A multivitamin is “insurance” against being deficient in vitamins and miner-
als, he said, but not a substitute for healthy foods. Eating healthfully versus 
taking supplements is a “false dichotomy.” 
The vast majority of people need to do both, but you shouldn’t view supple-
ments as taking the place of fresh plant foods, which, unlike your multivitamin-
mineral (MVM) supplement, contain dozens of important phytochemicals 
like beta-carotene, lycopene, flavonoids, and epicatechin (in green tea). 
Some newer supplements are jammed with a lot of “super ingredi-
ents,” but these products are unregulated and may be fraught with 
uncertainty. You might as well graze the farmer’s markets and stands 
for fresh sources of flavonoids and other phytochemicals, because 
these appear to be roughly the types of nutrient sources that humans 
have sought throughout our evolution.
We probably evolved to graze on plant foods and thus inherit their 
protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defenses (see the sidebar 
“Antioxidants: Cultivate Your Inner Nerf”). “We lost the ability a long time 
ago, when we became human, to synthesize these compounds [internally] 
ourselves,” Blumberg said. 
That’s all you really have to know about RDAs; they are not a maximum 
amount for your intake, but rather the minimum amount required to keep 
you from becoming deficient (the upper limit is abbreviated as TUL). For 
what it’s worth, the overall DRI is explained here: http://www.ars.usda.gov/
News/docs.htm?docid=10870.

Figuring Out Your Daily Micronutrient Requirements
According to this site, the DRI’s are actually a set of four reference values (of 
which RDAs are one).
“Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily 
dietary intake of a nutrient that is sufficient to meet the requirement 
of nearly all (97-98%) healthy persons.
Adequate Intake (AI) for a nutrient is […] only established when an 
RDA cannot be determined. Therefore a nutrient either has an RDA 
or an AI. The AI is based on observed intakes of the nutrient by a 
group of healthy persons.
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (TUL) is the highest daily intake of a 
nutrient that is likely to pose no risks of toxicity for almost all indi-
viduals. As intake above the UL increases, risk increases.
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the amount of a nutrient 
that is estimated to meet the requirement of half of all healthy indi-
viduals in the population.
Antioxidants: Cultivate Your Inner Nerf
There’s an easy way to help 
soak up oxidative stress in the 
body, the rust and decay that is 
behind aging and many chronic 
diseases (oxidation causes a bit-
ten apple to turn brown on the 
shelf, and iron to rust): eat lots 
of the tiny phytochemicals that 
turn on a protein in the cell’s 
nucleus called Nrf-2 (it’s pronounced “nerf2”).
“Our major focus is looking at polyphenols like the 
flavanoids as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories; dark 
chocolate, green tea, and tree nuts for example: almonds, 
walnuts, pistachios. Their skins are extremely rich in these 
compounds,” explained Dr. Jeff Blumberg, the director of 
the Antioxidants Research Laboratory at Tufts’ Jean Mayer 
USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. “One 
of the principal roles of these [compounds] are as phyto-
alexins—defense agents against insects, molds, ultraviolet 
light, any environmental toxicant—and [humans] may well 
have evolved to use those compounds for similar kinds of 
purposes.”
Similar to our inability to synthesize vitamin C for use in our 
cells, we may have evolved to graze on plants to borrow 
their internal defenses against pathogens. 
It turns out, however, that polyphenols are “lousy antioxi-
dants,” Blumberg said. “Very good in vitro as antioxidants,” 
but we don’t absorb them in high enough quantities to 
deal with the higher concentrations of free radicals in the 
blood and tissue. “To mop up all of the [reactive oxygen 
species, another name for free radicals], you need a big 
mop. The concentration of vitamin C, glutathione, and nitric 
acid are thousands of times higher” than the flavanoids.
Polyphenols “are still very good anti-inflammatories,” which 
goes hand in hand with oxidative stress. “If you provoke 
oxidative stress you can provoke inflammation. They are 
both intimately involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, 
like cancer, heart disease, as well as neurodegenerative dis-
eases like Parkinson’s and Alzeimer’s. Free radicals can cause 
damage to DNA, protein, enzymes; the damaged molecules 
stimulate the immune system to take care of them,” which 
gives rise to the inflammation.
By eating lots of fruits and veggies, you can turn on an 
anti-inflammatory pathway called “nerf2” after a protein in 
the cell’s nucleus: Nrf-2. “One of the primary pathways—the 
way these compounds work in very small concentrations in 
the cell are through cell-signaling transduction pathways,” 
Blumberg explained. 
“We have complex pathways that ultimately end up turning 
on or turning off our genes; we do this every day, and our 
diet plays a big influence on this, particularly the phyto-
chemicals.

Antioxidants: Cultivate Your Inner Nerf (continued)
Nrf-2 turns on the antioxidant response 
element on the genome, in your genes; 
it [thereby] upregulates antioxidant 
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 
and glutathione peroxidase. It can 
turn down some of the inflammatory 
genes—cytokines and interleukins that 
stimulate the immune system when you 
don’t want it to be stimulated; and this 
all happens at the genome level because of what you eat.
You don’t need too many of these compounds like you 
need a [a certain number of milligrams of vitamin C], all you 
need to do is turn on this one pathway, a few molecules will 
do it. It’s a huge amplification system.
There are a number of polyphenols which have been dem-
onstrated (all with in vitro studies, of course) to modulate 
Nrf-2, including curcumin (turmeric), sulphoraphane (broc-
coli), epicatechin (green tea), procyanidins (berry fruit), and 
caffeic acid phenethyl ester (honeybee propolis).”
You can turn on your own protective pathways by aiming 
for more antioxidant-containing ingredients in your diet.
Aim for Farms and Markets
Taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement is about half (or less) of the pic-
ture of micronutrients. The other half is the fun part: eating for health.
I try to aim for foods from local farms and farmer’s markets (see Chapter 5, 
for more on finding and choosing food). I seek to get most of my vitamins 
and minerals from healthy foods. By targeting healthy foods, I mean piling 
on the veggies (carrots, lettuce, yellow/red/orange bell peppers, broccoli, 
asparagus, etc.) and fruits (lots of berries, fresh apples, oranges, bananas, 
lemons), as well as eating pastured dairy (butter, cheese, milk), coconut milk, 
grass-fed meats, fish (including shellfish), a fairly neutral grain like brown rice 
(grains can be problematic), as well as some nuts, seeds, and plant oils like a 
little olive and coconut oil. 
The tools we discuss at the end of this chapter will help you determine 
whether your vitamin and mineral consumption is adequate or not. The 
degrading of nutrients in kept food is an issue, too. Oxidative damage 
(think juice in paper cartons, or old refrigerated veggies that have changed 
in color) can degrade a food item’s nutritional content, and supplements 
whose expiration dates have passed will no longer have the potency indi-
cated on the bottle. 
Use common sense: a ready-to-drink carton of OJ may quickly lose 
its vitamin C content in the refrigerator (using glass containers 
and drinking it fresh from frozen are better), according to Professor 
Carol Johnston at Arizona State University. Gnarly-looking veggies 
orphaned in the back of the food drawer have probably also lost a lot 
of their antioxidant and vitamin power. Check the expiration date of 
any multivitamin/mineral supplements (MVMs).

For most of us, life involves a marathon of over-programming and schedul-
ing that keeps us sitting down most of the time and snatching random food 
items here and there on the run. As a result, some of us might benefit from 
a multivitamin/mineral supplement, but a healthy dose of skepticism in 
regard to the quality and efficacy of these products is in order. 
The bioavailability of these artificially manufactured nutrients is a highly 
significant variable as well, according to a 2006 executive summary in the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.4 Here’s their take on this issue:
Key factors determining the bioavailability of micronutrients are the 
chemical form in which the nutrient is presented to the intestinal 
absorptive surface, the presence of other competing chemicals in 
the intestinal lumen, the concentration of food constituents (such 
as phytates and other chelating agents) that bind to the nutrient 
and make it unavailable for absorption, intestinal transit time, and 
enzyme activity. 
A nutrient may affect not only the absorption of other nutrients, but 
also the transport, tissue uptake, function and metabolism of other 
nutrients.
The following URL, a search of Google Scholar, provides much food for 
thought on the matter of nutrition in a pill: http://scholar.google.com/
scholar?q=efficacy+of+multivitamin+mineral+products&hl=en&btnG
=Search&as_sdt=1%2C46&as_sdtp=on. 
We can probably benefit from a measure of insurance. You might mix and 
match a supplement (e.g., D3, calcium, magnesium) with healthy foods from 
local farms in season. If you are a nutrition power user, and I’m guessing 
many of the readers are, you could actually test yourself for vitamin and min-
eral insufficiencies before committing to certain MVMs and nutrient intakes.
I recently spent the better part of three days climbing Mt. Rainier, a 14,411 ft. 
active volcano near Seattle, Washington. Nothing grows up there. All water 
comes from melted snow. The food the guides cooked in the mess tent was 
outstanding in taste (veggie burritos loaded with avocados and tomatoes, 
gorpy oatmeal, and mounds of cheesy eggs and bacon), but I couldn’t 
have lived on it 100 percent of the time, in terms of micronutrient intake. 
Obviously, if I were spending weeks on a mountaineering trek in similar 
environs, I would consider bringing a vitamin and mineral supplement to 
buoy up my nutrition.
Not only is the research mixed 
or inconclusive on whether 
MVMs actually prevent 
chronic diseases,5 but there are 
undoubtedly huge differences in 
quality among the thousands. 
of available MVM-related  
products.

Reading an MVM Supplement Facts Label
Every MVM supplement comes with a Supplement Facts 
label. If it doesn’t, you’d better give it the heave-ho. You 
should read the label before you take any of the substances 
(whatever form they’re in: pill or liquid or chewable), 
especially before handing some of them to a child or other 
family member. 
Figure 4-1 shows one of these Supplement Facts labels. The 
first column specifies the micronutrient, like vitamin E or 
calcium (this supplement happens to include only one 
mineral; it’s a special vitamin and phytochemical  
combination).
Figure 4-1. Vitamin Supplement Facts label
The next column is the Amount Per Serving. This is the 
micronutrient amount you’re going to get if you ingest the 
recommended serving, in this case, two wafers.
The amounts are in mg, mcg, and IUs. This can be confus-
ing, as different nutrients use different units of measure: for 
instance, vitamins A, D, and E are labeled in IUs; vitamin C in 
mg; and folic acid in mcg. 
The more you learn about micronutrients, the greater com-
fort you will have rattling off the IUs vs. the mcgs, however, 
since each of the vitamins and minerals are almost always 
paired with the same unit of measurement whenever you 
come across them. You’ll get used to them.
The next column, % Daily Value, puts this information into 
better perspective. This number represents the percentage 
of the vitamin or mineral you will ingest in one serving, 
relative to the public health recommendations for a daily 
amount of the nutrient. 
For example, 100 percent means you’re getting some 
amount akin to the RDA for that micronutrient; 400 percent 
states that a serving contains four times the recommended 
minimum amount. 
The cross-shaped glyph signifies that public health bodies 
(such as the Food and Nutrition Board in the U.S.) have not 
established a recommended amount for that substance. 
It might be a “super food” such carotenoids or blueberry 
extract that the government has not yet come up with a 
standard for.

Cooking Alters Micronutrient Content
Cooking Alters Micronutrient Content
If you don’t take an MVM supplement or your use of them is sporadic and 
strategic, remember that various forms of cooking have a significant effect 
on the nutritive value of veggies, fruits, and meats.
For example, if you cook (and drain the boiling water from) a stalk of broc-
coli, with the assumption that you will be ingesting fantastic amounts of 
vitamin C and B12, keep in mind that the boiling itself may reduce the vita-
min content by 75 percent and 50 percent, respectively.6
A study showed varying effects of boiling on veggies such as broccoli 
and asparagus.7 For asparagus, boiling actually raised its “[free] radi-
cal scavenging activity,” or RSA (a measure of antioxidant activity), 
by 10 percent, and 15 percent of the original vitamin C content of the 
veggie was left in the cooking water. Broccoli retained only 83 percent 
of its RSA after boiling, and the cooking water had a high antioxidant 
value as well.
There are many solutions to this conundrum. If you’re cooking a stew, then 
make sure you consume the broth with the stew contents, because this liq-
uid will likely contain some of the nutrients. 
If you boil veggies on occasion, you can be hardcore like me: take the left-
over boiling water and use it as a base or an ingredient for a smoothie. The 
study referenced by the last note pointed out that a stalk of boiled broccoli, 
for instance, leaves about 28 mg of its vitamin C in the cooking water (the 
water alone containing about a fifth of a good day’s worth of C for the aver-
age person). For sure, the water tastes a little weird at first, but be creative, 
as in the upcoming sidebar. 
You can also impress your friends and appall your guests by simply guzzling 
the leftover water out of the pan. 
As we saw in Chapter 2, there are many handy tools for helping determine 
the nutritional content, or lack thereof, of your diet. We’ll take another look 
at some of these, and introduce a few new ones, in “Getting Micronutrient 
Information Online: Web Tools,” at the end of this chapter. The “FitDay on 
Vending-Machine Fare” section gives the lowdown on some of the “food-like 
substances” some of us geeks like to eat.

Capturing the Cooked Veggie’s Nutrition in a Smoothie
Here’s a recipe for a smoothie that will help recapture some of the vitamins and 
minerals lost when boiling a vegetable (for you steamers out there—and I’m one of 
them—that cooking style also reduces veggie nutrition). Mix the following ingredi-
ents in a blender:
1 grated carrot
½ a lemon (more vitamin C)—you could substitute an orange or the like, but lem-
ons have less fructose
About 4–8 ounces coconut milk (healthy fats, calcium)
1 scoop of whey protein mix (branched-chain amino acids)
A handful of raspberries (phytochemicals and taste)
½ teaspoon of local honey (a bit of sweetness)
1 tablespoon Greek-style plain yogurt (consistency, calcium)
Pour in water from boiling asparagus and broccoli, or any other veggie. Mix well. I 
tried this at home, and it was delicious. Then I ate the warm veggies with a nice pat 
of pastured butter and a piece of chicken from Gaylord Farm in Vermont that I had 
in the freezer. Voilà!

State University is one of the best places around for finding out more 
detailed biochemical information about these substances: http://lpi.oregon-
state.edu/infocenter/. Whenever possible, each nutrient has a reference back 
to the LPI pages. 
Vitamins
Vitamins are organic molecules (the ones containing carbon atoms) that are 
cofactors or helper molecules for enzymes that play vital roles in the body. 
Back in the early part of the last century, the term “vitamin” was formed from 
“vital amines,” when it was thought that all vitamins were amine molecules.
Vitamins aren’t used for energy themselves, but they are crucial for many of 
the internal chemical reactions by which our body’s machinery can utilize 
protein, carbs, and fat for fuel. 

Micronutrients: Vitamins, Minerals, and Phytochemicals

Vitamins
Food scientists don’t consider a nutrient a vitamin unless it’s essential for 
our metabolism or other vital systems, and must be obtained via the diet. 
Monkeys, apes, humans, and some birds, for example, have lost the ability 
to synthesize vitamin C. We can biosynthesize vitamin D from exposure to 
ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun, however, and some bacteria in our guts 
can synthesize vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin.
Enzymes are biochemicals (usually proteins) that catalyze or initiate chemical 
reactions but are not used up by those reactions. Enzymes commonly end 
with the suffix “ase,” as in lactase, the enzyme that allows people to digest 
milk sugar or lactose, or the enzyme in saliva that disassembles starch into 
smaller sugars, amylase.
We don’t use up vitamins for energy, as we do carbohydrates or protein in 
food, but they take part in numerous essential chemical reactions, or simply 
are hormones themselves, like the active form of vitamin D.
Even though vitamin D might get all the splashy headlines these days, the 
eight B-complex vitamins and vitamins A, C, E, and K also play crucial roles 
in the basic physiological processes that keep us alive.
Fat-Soluble Vitamins
A subset of vitamins can be stored in body fat and are thus described as 
“fat-soluble.” This characteristic has two main ramifications. First, to properly 
absorb these vitamins in supplement form, it helps to consume them with 
a little dietary fat (e.g., a blob of Greek-style yogurt). Furthermore, eating 
healthy fats, like a pastured egg, an avocado, or coconut milk, will help you 
derive more fat-soluble vitamins, because the fats you are digesting contain 
the nutrients. 
Second, since fat-soluble vitamins can be stored, you can potentially over-
load your body with fat-soluble vitamin supplements. Although it’s difficult 
to do, you could, for example, take in too much vitamin A in cod liver oil and 
potentially accumulate toxic levels of this vitamin. 
An upcoming section is devoted to vitamin-A toxicity, or hypervi-
taminosis A. For an article that goes into more scientific detail, see 
http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminA/. 
This is the reason why you shouldn’t start taking mega doses of vitamin A 
(or any supplement, for that matter) without reading the supplement labels 
and checking the RDA for adults and kids first (see the sidebar earlier in this 
chapter on reading the Supplement Facts label).
The fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K. 
I made up my own mnemonic device for remembering them: “a deck 
of cards,” ADEK. It’s a start, right?

Vitamin A
This vitamin is available in the diet in two forms: 
• Retinol, or preformed vitamin A (“true” vitamin A) from animal sources 
like eggs, pastured butter, fish, meats, and cod liver oil. 
• Pro-vitamin A carotenoid, the vegetable- and fruit-based beta-carotene 
(found in orange and other brightly colored foods like carrots, canta-
loupes, peaches, sweet potatoes, and leafy veggies), which the body can 
convert into retinol, albeit at a low conversion ratio.8
There is an international conversion factor for foods and supplements called 
the retinol activity equivalents (RAEs), described in the upcoming “Retinol 
Activity Equivalents for Vitamin A” sidebar. For example, 12 units of beta-
carotene are about the equivalent of 1 unit of vitamin A or retinol.9 
Beta-carotene is also an effective antioxidant. 
You could theoretically (given the cooking method and your individual 
ability to incorporate food; i.e., no potential digestive problems, age, etc.) 
acquire all the vitamin A you need for a day from a medium-sized carrot, a 
baked sweet potato, and a salad ingredient of spinach. In fact, that would 
probably give you more than you need (unless you’re an athlete putting in 
mega miles).
The body converts retinol from these various forms of vitamin A into retinoic 
acid, which is the molecule responsible for vitamin A’s biological effects. 
For example, retinoic acid affects gene transcription, and thereby affects 
how certain bodily proteins are synthesized (some tissues have retinoic acid 
receptors, or RARs).10 
Vitamin A is essential for the health of your retinas, particularly for night 
vision. If you bump up your vitamin–A containing veggie intake after a 
period of deficiency, you might notice the night-vision difference right away. 
As you’re driving at night, can you read the small print on those luminescent 
street signs?
Vitamin A has a crucial anti-infective role in the immune system. Retinol is 
required in the body for the normal functioning of epithelial cells, the “first 
line of defense” that line the airways and digestive tract, for instance. The 
body needs vitamin A to develop white blood cells such as lymphocytes, 
which are central to our immune system.11
“Vitamin A appears to facilitate the mobilization of iron from storage sites 
[in the body] to the developing red blood cell for incorporation into hemo-
globin, the oxygen carrier in red blood cells,” according to the online Linus 
Pauling Institute (LPI) article at http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vita-
mins/vitaminA/index.html#function.
Vitamin A is essential for the 
health of your retinas, par-
ticularly for night vision. If you 
bump up your vitamin–A con-
taining veggie intake after a 
period of deficiency, you might 
notice the night-vision differ-
ence right away.

Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAEs) for 
Vitamin A
Not all vitamin A is created equal. If you ingest beta-carotene, which the body 
can convert to vitamin A or retinol in small amounts, you can use the following 
equation to estimate the equivalent consumption of retinol (retinol is the 
“pure” vitamin A form found in foods like liver, eggs, fish oil, milk, and cheese):
RAE Vitamin A = mcg retinol + (mcg beta-carotene equivalents/12)
Mcg stands for micrograms. If you eat a medium-sized carrot that has 0.0 mcg 
of retinol and 5,054 mcg of beta-carotene (according to NutritionData), that 
veggie represents an RAE of about 421 mcg. The U.S. Recommended 
Dietary Allowance is 900 mcg RAE for males over 14 and 700 mcg 
RAE for females over 14, rising to 770 mcg RAE for a pregnant 
woman and 1,300 mcg RAE for a lactating mom.
The RDA for kids is 300 mcg RAE for ages 1–3, 400 mcg RAE for 
ages 4–8, and 600 mcg RAE for ages 9–13. So you can see that 
with one measly carrot, people are well on their way to meet-
ing their dietary requirements for vitamin A. That’s where the 
sweet potato and spinach come in.12
Vitamin A toxicity
Since vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, it is possible to take too much pre-
formed vitamin A (you do not get vitamin A toxicity, or hypervitaminosis A, 
from eating a lot of carotenoids, as found in carrots, bell peppers, sweet 
potatoes, and mangos, for instance). 
Although fairly rare, hypervitaminosis A has serious symptoms, such as liver 
abnormalities, reduced bone density, and cerebral edema (what occurs with 
the onset of the severe form of high-altitude sickness). Most people fully 
recover by simply stopping the overdosing of A.
Check the tolerable upper limit (TUL) for vitamin A before you start imbibing 
a lot of preformed vitamin A in the form of supplements or cod liver oil, for 
example.13 
Vitamin A amounts are specified in IUs. To convert IUs to micrograms: 
1 IU of A equals 0.3 micrograms.
I did a search on cod liver oil at www.nutritiondata.com. Figure 4-2 shows 
what I found. Look at that retinol amount for just one tablespoon: 4,051 
micrograms. The TULs specify that adults shouldn’t take more than 10,000 IU 
or 3,000 mcg of retinol per day, and kids aged four to eight should take no 
more than 3,000 IU or 900 mcg.14

Again, it is quite easy to get enough vitamin A by eating whole foods such as 
vegetables that contain carotenoids, salmon (an RAE of 229 mcg), and two 
scrambled eggs (an RAE exceeding 600 mcg).
Vitamin D
If ever a vitamin could be deemed “sexy,” it would be vitamin D.
The hype surrounding vitamin D seems to be spreading: a very tanned 
checkout girl, who looked like she’d recently broken Owen Wilson’s and 
Matthew McConaughey’s hearts (at the same time), recently told me she’d 
spent the weekend “getting her vitamin D” (and she probably did get her D 
that way). 
Everywhere you look, another “media story based on a study” touts the vita-
min’s multifarious benefits. 
The hype seems to have at least a partial basis in fact. 
Photosynthesis has generated vitamin D in life forms on earth for millions of 
years, and it is a remarkable biosynthetic mechanism by which we can create 
a vital chemical for our bodies from sunlight. 
We’re like plants, basking in the sun for reasons much more important than 
an excuse to wear Ray-Bans.
The human genome has hundreds of sites known as vitamin D receptors 
(VDRs), indicating that the active form of vitamin D can bind with these sites

Vitamins
and affect gene expression (meaning some “health-positive” genes can be 
turned on, and/or genes that have negative effects can be switched off).15
We geeks are often indoor creatures
Along with sunblock, which will screen out the ultraviolet (UV) rays that 
help produce vitamin D, modern life—specifically, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, 
cubicle life, and every other excuse to sit in a glorified box in front of a 
screen—has driven us indoors, where we were never really designed to 
spend a lot of time in the first place. 
Back in my own software engineering days, I tried to walk in the sun as much 
as possible during the workday. I walked half an hour or more every morning 
from the train along Cambridge, MA’s sunny sidewalks (yeah, the sun comes 
out in New England, sometimes). I went outside several times a day to find 
splotches of sun in Kendall Square. Right now I’m headed off to sit on a rock 
in the sun and swim in a Vermont waterway called the Mad River. Of course, 
I take some D supplements too. I do spend the winter in New England, a 
region and time of year not usually known for sunshine.
Your vitamin D status is a relevant marker of health. A Massachusetts General 
Hospital study found that among 290 patients entering the hospital with a 
variety of ailments, about 57 percent of them were vitamin D–deficient, with 
blood levels of 15 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter) or less.16
A September 2009 study of more than 3,000 older folks in the U.S. found that 
“compared [with] those [who had] optimal vitamin D status, those with low 
vitamin D levels were three times more likely to die from heart disease and 
2.5 times more likely to die from any cause.”17
The biosynthetic process
Here’s how we naturally produce our own vitamin D. The skin generates 
cholecalciferol, the inactive form of vitamin D, when cholesterol molecules 
in epidermal cells are exposed to ultraviolet radiation.18
The liver converts this biochemical to calcidiol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 
abbreviated 25(OH)D—a prehormone and the form of vitamin D that blood 
tests detect (see the “Testing for D” section). A prehormone is a substance 
that other tissues in the body convert into an active hormone, a signaling 
chemical that binds with receptors and launches chemical reactions in the 
body. 
It’s good to know all this stuff because you’re probably going to be testing 
for vitamin D, and the doctors will be casually tossing around terms like 
“25(OH)D.” Besides, you can also impress tanned checkout girls (or guys) with 
your advanced vitamin-D know-how!
Photosynthesis has generated 
vitamin D in life forms on earth 
for millions of years, and it is a 
remarkable biosynthetic mech-
anism by which we can create 
a vital chemical for our bodies 
from sunlight.

Vitamins

It’s a dessert topping—it’s a hormone!
An enzyme in the kidneys called 25(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase further modifies 
this chemical calcidiol to calcitriol, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This is a sec-
osteroid hormone that is responsible for most of vitamin D’s physiological 
effects. A secosteroid hormone is similar to a steroid hormone like testoster-
one and estrogen, but has a slightly different molecular structure. 
This hormone binds with hundreds of sites throughout the body that 
have vitamin D receptors, and thereby affects how many of our genes are 
expressed. 
Vitamin D is an essential molecule for bone health, but it has also been 
associated with promoting insulin sensitivity (where your cells are able to 
admit glucose and amino acids in response to the presence of insulin in 
the bloodstream), preventing the cell proliferation associated with certain 
cancers such as those of the prostate, breast, and colon, as well as helping 
prevent high blood pressure.19
Sources of Vitamin D
Along with exposure to the sun, you can also build up your vitamin D with 
food and supplements. 
Some foods are fortified with vitamin D3 (like milk, about 115 to 124 IU per 8 
ounces20), or contain moderate vitamin D3 levels without fortification (grass-
fed or free range eggs and salmon). A can of sardines has about 250 IU of 
vitamin D3, but that’s not enough for a day.
The sun might still be the best way to get vitamin D, for the same reason we 
drink water through our mouths instead of running off to inject it intrave-
nously—because that’s the way we’re designed. It’s also impossible to devel-
op vitamin D toxicity from the sun, unless you’re also taking too high a dose 
in supplemental form. My guess is that surfers and lifeguards who aren’t 
covered by a wetsuit and sunblock all the time have pretty healthy D levels. 
A recent study of some people in East Africa who live pastoral or hunter-
gatherer lifestyles, the Maasai and the Hadzabe, noted that their mean 
25(OH)D levels fell into the mid to high-40s range. The Maasai’s mean 
levels were “48 ng/ml (119 nmol/L) and ranged from 23 to 67 ng/ml,” 
and the Hadzabe’s were “44 ng/ml and ranged from 28 to 68 ng/ml.” A 
“deficient” level, according to U.S. standards, is beneath 32 ng/ml (see 
http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2012/01/25/new-study-vitamin-d-
levels-of-the-maasai-and-hadzabe-of-africa/).
But what about those of us who live in the northern latitude—not near 
the equator, in Australia, or in the U.S. sunbelt—or have a darker skin color, 
which makes it more difficult compared with lighter-skinned people to 
make D from the sun (especially in northern regions)?

Obesity also makes photosynthesized vitamin D less bioavailable. See 
http://hjira.com/acjn/72-3-690.full.pdf.
Supplements
Vitamin D3 supplements are cheap (about $30 per year for a daily 2,000 IU 
dose, the last time I looked) and readily available. The National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) has recommended that adults, kids, teens, and pregnant 
women take 600 IU per day, the minimum amount necessary for bone 
health. As for blood levels, “levels ≥50 nmol/L (≥20 ng/ml) are sufficient for 
most people,” according to an NIH fact sheet.21
In terms of vitamin D, 40 IU equals 1 microgram (mcg). So if you take a 
4,000 IU dose daily, you’re getting about 100 mcg.
However, the Vitamin D Council, an advocacy group, recommends that both 
adults and kids should attain a D serum level of about 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/l). 
There is obviously some disagreement between the recommended levels 
of the federal government and the Council, which suggests that the public-
health recommendations move too slowly to track the latest D research 
findings. In other words, the active form of vitamin D affects much more, 
physiologically, than calcium and bone health.
You could take the conservative approach and consider the U.S. govern-
ment’s recommended dose, then test to determine if the supplement’s 
effects are adequate. Also see this page for the Vitamin D Council’s recom-
mended amounts and its rationale: www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-
d/how-to-get-your-vitamin-d/vitamin-d-supplementation.
If you’re vitamin D–deficient, there seems to be some evidence that remedy-
ing that condition will aid an athlete’s or a weekend warrior’s sports perfor-
mance. See the “Better D Status Boosts Sports Performance” sidebar.
Supplement thoughtfully
To reach the higher levels in your blood tests, in almost all instances, you 
would have to take more supplemental D3 than the NIH’s recommended 
600 IU per day, although how the body responds to vitamin D3 supplements 
varies from one person to the next. Some adults may attain healthy levels 
with 600 to 2000 IU per day; for others, it may take 4,000 IU or more per day. 
Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in human adipose tissue, so toxicity is 
possible when thoughtlessly supplementing with vitamins A and D, for 
instance, especially for kids. Their low body weights make them more vul-
nerable to toxicity when their dosages are recklessly scaled upward. An adult 
dose of 5,000 IU per day will not have the same effect on a kid who weighs 
50 pounds.

Vitamins
Chapter 4
98
The federal government puts the TUL for D3 at 4,000 IU per day for males 
and females of age 9 and above, “while symptoms of toxicity are unlikely at 
daily intakes below 10,000 IU/day.”22
Other D3 researchers have noted that the TUL could be much higher than 
that, since about 30 minutes of full-body, high-noon sun exposure will gen-
erate up to 20,000 IU naturally. 
“Excessive sun exposure does not result in vitamin D toxicity, because the 
sustained heat on the skin is thought to photodegrade previtamin D3 and 
vitamin D3 as it is formed,” according to a National Institutes of Health 
Dietary Fact sheet on vitamin D. For more information, see http://ods.od.nih.
gov/factsheets/vitamind/#h8.
Testing for D
Testing your D3 levels involves asking your doctor to have it included in a 
blood workup during a typical routine checkup or using one of several pri-
vate testing services.
The result will be in the form of a number representing your blood level 
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In the U.S., this will most likely represent a 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (sometimes shortened to “25 (OH) D”) level in nano-
grams per milliliter (ng/ml), a figure like “48 ng.” 
Other countries, like the United Kingdom, may provide this number in nano-
moles per liter (nmol/L), resulting in a number that is about 2.5 times higher 
(48 ng is 120 nmol/L). 
According to the NIH, levels greater than 20 ng/ml are “generally considered 
adequate for bone and overall health in healthy individuals,”23 but other 
researchers or advocates, such as the Vitamin D Council, advocate a higher 
number—50 ng/ml or more. 
Science Daily reported on a February 2011 study that found much higher 
daily doses of vitamin D were required to protect most adults from cancer.  
“We found that daily intakes of vitamin D by adults in the range of 4000–
8000 IU are needed to maintain blood levels of vitamin D metabolites in the 
range needed to reduce by about half the risk of several diseases—breast 
cancer, colon cancer, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes,” according to a 
doctor at the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.24
Again, you have to test yourself periodically if you’re going to boost 
your supplementation of vitamin D3.
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is one of the body’s primary antioxidants. Since it’s stored in body 
fat, vitamin E helps prevent the destruction by free radicals of the fats in cell 
membranes. Fats are a major component of cell membranes, so vitamin E 

Micronutrients: Vitamins, Minerals, and Phytochemicals

Vitamins
has a key role in cell biology. Vitamin E also helps combat the oxidation by 
free radicals (the bad guys, when they’re not being used to destroy invading 
germs) of low-density lipoproteins or LDLs. 
LDLs are protein-fat-cholesterol complexes that travel through the blood-
stream.
Vitamin C helps regenerate the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E—an exam-
ple of two vitamins working synergistically and why you should aim to keep 
up to speed on all vitamins.
The liver secretes a form of vitamin E called alpha-tocopherol.25
Naturally sourced vitamin E is called d-alpha-tocopherol; the synthetically 
produced form is dl-alpha-tocopherol.26
The RDA for adults from adolescence on is 15 mg. One ounce of almonds, 
about 23 nuts, gives you 7.4 mg, which is almost half of the vitamin an adult 
needs to reach the RDA. Avocados (providing 4.5 mg, about a third of the 
RDA), olive oil, Swiss chard, spinach (cooked and raw), asparagus, and sun-
flower seeds are also very good sources of vitamin E.
E and C supplements
Some studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of supplementing with vita-
min E, as well as C for that matter, according to the National Institutes of 
Health in the U.S.27 On the other hand, supplementing up to the RDA for 
these vitamins in most cases can’t hurt. For a vitamin C–related supplement 
discussion, see the “Vitamin C: Helps Keep Your Tissues and Fat-Burning 
Capabilities Intact” sidebar.
Vitamin K
Vitamin K, another fat-soluble vitamin, plays an important role in blood clot-
ting (the “K” comes from the German word “koagulation”), bone health, and 
preventing or reducing the calcification of arteries. 
There are two naturally occurring forms, broadly referred to as K1 (phylloqui-
none) and K2 (menaquinone). The easiest way to think of vitamin K is that 
it puts calcium where it belongs (the bones) and removes it from where it 
doesn’t belong (the arteries).
Plants manufacture K1, which is the vitamin K that newborn infants are 
given (I found it jarring—as the “husband witness,” milling around somewhat 
ineffectually—when immediately upon both of my children’s births, they 
were jabbed in the leg with a vitamin K1 shot, even before being wrapped in 
a blanket). The usual healthy suspects—parsley, spinach, leafy green lettuce, 
kale, broccoli, and olive oil—are good sources of vitamin K1.
Some bacteria in the large intestine generate K2, one of the few instances 
where a vitamin can be synthesized in the body (see below for the food 
sources of this nutrient). 
Avocados, olive oil, Swiss  
chard, spinach, asparagus, and 
sunflower seeds are also very 
good sources of vitamin E.

Vitamins
Chapter 4

Why should you even think about foods and supplements containing 
K2, if the gut flora can synthesize it? Because antibiotics can kill the 
bacteria in your gut that produce it, and it’s a fairly important and 
underestimated vitamin that calls for insurance measures to make 
sure you’re getting enough.
The bacteria make a range of K2 designated as MK-n (MK-4 in meats or 
supplements; MK-8 or 9 in cheese), where “n” stands for a 5-carbon unit on 
the side of the molecule, according to the Linus Pauling Institute’s page on 
K2: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminK/.
For example, menaquinone-4 (MK-4) means the molecule has four 5-carbon 
units.
Grass-fed cheese appears to be a good source of K2, according to Mark Sisson’s 
Mark’s Daily Apple page: www.marksdailyapple.com/cheese-unhealthy/. 
Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, eggs, and chicken contain MK-4 in higher 
amounts than other foods.28
These comments on vitamin K2 contained in cheese and Natto (a fermented 
soy food popular in Japan that is a very good source of minerals and pro-
tein), from a 2004 Dutch study published in the The Journal of Nutrition, are 
eye-openers: 
Cheese has not been established as a dietary risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease in epidemiological studies, despite its high levels of 
saturated fat and salt. We hypothesize that menaquinones in cheese 
(MK-8 and MK-9) could exert a beneficial effect in the cardiovascular 
system and that the high cheese consumption in France and the 
Mediterranean countries may possibly account for lower preva-
lences of [heart disease].{…]
In healthy Japanese subjects who consumed fermented soybean 
(Natto) high in menaquinone (especially MK-7), serum concen-
trations of MK-7 and carboxylated osteocalcin were significantly 
increased.29
K2 activates a protein called osteocalcin that builds or remodels bones by 
binding calcium to a mineral matrix. In fact, K2 works together with vitamin 
D and calcium to keep your skeleton healthy and strong. The active form of 
vitamin D, calcitriol, plays a role in the synthesis of osteocalcin.
Another vitamin K–dependent protein called matrix Gla protein (MGP) 
helps prevent the calcification or hardening of soft tissue and cartilage. 
Runners and cyclists, keep that one in mind as you consider vitamin K2  
supplementation.

Water-Soluble Vitamins
The water-soluble vitamins do not have to be eaten with fat to be absorbed, 
and it’s harder to overdose on these vitamins, as the body can flush them 
out via the urine. This doesn’t make these substances—the eight B-complex 
vitamins and vitamin C—any more innocuous or less important than the 
fat-soluble ones, though. Some of the most infamous nutrient-related dis-
eases are caused by deficiencies in C (scurvy), thiamine (beriberi), and niacin 
(pellagra).
B vitamins
This group of eight vitamins—B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 
(pantothenic acid), B6, B7 (Biotin), B9 (folic acid), and B12—has a wide vari-
ety of vital roles in the body. The MVM supplements will refer to the whole 
group of them as a B-complex vitamin. 
Your first question might be: what about all those missing Bs (B4, B8, B10, 
etc.)? The short answer is that scientists decided that they weren’t “vitamins” 
anymore, for reasons such as the body’s ability to synthesize them.
Thiamine (B1) was one of the first vitamins ever discovered, in the late nine-
teenth century. “The story of thiamine is the story of beriberi, the disease 
caused by thiamine deficiency.”30
In the early 1880s, for example, a Japanese naval physician named Kanehiro 
Takkaki found that adding meat, fish, and vegetables to the white-rice sea-
man’s staple helped to cure a disease that had cut a swath through sailors, 
many of whom had languished on a low-level diet of polished white rice.
When you remove the brown skin on rice, usually accomplished by 
milling machines, to make “polished white rice,” even the tiny amounts 
of thiamine present in brown rice are lost. Beriberi, the horrible dis-
ease that has been common in populations that depend on rice in 
their diets, is broken down into “dry,” “wet,” and "cerebral" beriberi (see 
http://lpioregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/thiamin/).
Thiamine plays a number of crucial roles as a coenzyme (an essential assis-
tant for an enzyme) in basic metabolic processes.31 
Transketolase, for example, is a key enzyme for synthesizing DNA and RNA, 
among other biochemicals. Its presence in diminishing amounts in red 
blood cells is taken for a possible sign of thiamine deficiency.
The RDA of thiamine is only 1.2 mg for an adult male and 1.1 mg for females. 
Three scrambled eggs provide just 0.1 mg, the same amount you get from 
a cup of plain yogurt, about 4 ounces of cooked brown rice, or one slice of 
beef liver. Thiamine tends to be in lots of foods in tiny amounts.

B2 (riboflavin) is involved in the metabolism of food (carbs, protein, and fats), 
as well as in the formation of other B vitamins such as niacin into their cor-
responding coenzymes. 
B2 is an integral part of a coenzyme that assists glutathione, for example, 
one of the body’s major built-in antioxidants.32 
Similar to B1, the riboflavin RDA is 1.3 mg for adult males and 1.1 mg for 
females 19 and older. An apple (0.1 mg), a small Atlantic salmon filet (0.7 
mg), and a hard-boiled egg (0.3 mg) get you most of the way there, accord-
ing to NutritionData. 
Niacin (B3) is also known as nicotinic acid, but it has no relation to the nico-
tine in cigarettes.33 
Severe deficiency in B3 vitamins can cause pellagra, a disease whose name 
may be derived from the Italian words for “rough skin.”
Pellagra is considered the disease of the four Ds: dermatitis, diarrhea, 
dementia, and death. As explained in Frances R. Frankenburg's book 
Vitamin Discoveries and Disasters, once the Europeans imported 
maize, or corn, from North America, pellagra began to spread in 
Europe. Maize is a cheap source of calories, but not of good nutrition; 
the niacin (B3) is bound and not absorbed unless the corn is soaked in 
limewater or another alkaline solution—a process called nixtamaliza-
tion—as is done to make Mexican tortillas. The preColumbian and 
preHispanic populations of the Americas did not have the same prob-
lems, because they knew how to mix corn with other foods. 
The liver can also synthesize B3 from the amino acid tryptophan (an amino 
acid is a building block for proteins), but it takes a lot of tryptophan (60 mg) 
to make 1 mg of B3. As an amino acid, tryptophan is a component of good 
protein sources like turkey, salmon, eggs, and whey protein. For example, 
half a filet of salmon will give you about 450 mg of tryptophan (along with 
many other amino acids).
The RDA for niacin is 16 mg per day for an adult male, and 14 mg for a 
female. That tasty filet of salmon will give you about 14 mg of niacin alone: 
other good sources include a 6-ounce serving of chicken breast (almost 20 
mg), turkey (a little less than chicken), half a can of tuna (about 5 mg), and 
an avocado (about 3 mg).
Vitamin B5, or pantothenic acid, is essential for all forms of life, due to its 
conversion to coenzyme A (CoA).34 CoA is a cog in a central metabolic path-
way of biology called the Krebs or citric acid cycle, by which cells generate 
energy from food sources. 
The adequate intake (AI) for pantothenic acid, since it doesn’t have an RDA, 
is 5 mg per day for adults. You can get vitamin B5 pretty easily from foods: a 
Maize is a cheap source  
of calories, but not of

small piece of wild Atlantic salmon has 3 mg, half a chicken breast has about 
1 mg, and a California avocado has 2 mg.
Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme involved 
in the cleaving of glucose from glycogen (the way the body stores starch in 
the muscles). 
Glycogen is a long chain of glucose molecules. When your muscles need 
energy (you’re standing up now, right?), the muscle cells look to acquire it 
from glycogen, which is like their own food pantry. 
The muscles also have their own stored fats, from which they derive a 
substantial amount of their fuel. Interestingly, the fats inside muscles 
store more energy in calories than the total amount of glycogen that 
your body stores.
The chain of glucose molecules that make up glycogen has to be broken up 
into the separate pieces of glucose so that cells can use the latter for energy 
(see Chapter 3).
Coenzymes are like an enzyme’s essential assistant; they bind with the 
enzyme and are a part of the chemical reactions that enzymes initiate. 
B6 is also a coenzyme in the production of glucose or fuel from protein, a 
pivotal metabolic process called gluconeogenesis. Reactions that are depen-
dent on B6 are also involved in the nervous system, such as generating 
serotonin from the amino acid tryptophan, and synthesizing the neurotrans-
mitters dopamine and norepinephrine.35
Vitamin B7 (biotin) is also an enzyme cofactor.36 Remember that scene from 
Rocky when Rocky Balboa chugged the raw eggs before heading off on 
another Philadelphia jaunt? Well, think twice. Raw egg whites contain a 
chemical called avidin that binds to biotin, prevents its absorption, and can 
lead to biotin deficiency.37
The AI for biotin or B7 is 30 mcg per day for an adult.
Folates are the form of vitamin B9 found in food, while folic acid is the syn-
thetic form found in supplements and fortified foods.
The U.S. government has required breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pas-
tas, rice, and other grain products to be fortified with folic acid since 1996, 
because people eat these foods in large amounts, and the grains are poor 
natural B9 sources. The RDAs for B9 are based on a term called dietary folate 
equivalent (DFE). 
According to the NIH fact sheet for folate, “DFE accounts for the easier 
absorption of folate in supplements and fortified foods compared with folic 
acid found naturally in foods, which is absorbed only about half as well. 
One DFE = 1 microgram food folate, which = 0.6 microgram folic acid from 
supplements and fortified foods.”38 So, the DFEs are 600 mcg per day for 
In biochemistry, the niacin 
coenzymes NAD and NADP play 
central roles in the metabolism 
of macronutrients (carbs,  
protein, and fats), as well as 
in the reactions involving the 
synthesis of molecules such as 
cholesterol and fatty acids.

pregnant women, 500 mcg for lactating women, and 400 mcg per day for 
adult men and other women.
Broccoli, asparagus, and spinach are good sources of folates, along with the 
fortified breads and other foods. For example, only eight spears of boiled 
asparagus will give you about 180 mcg of B9, and a pretty big spinach salad 
or two hard-boiled eggs provides about the same. Two tablespoons of salt-
less peanut butter only give you about 24 mcg of B9.
Which is better for B vitamins, a grass-fed or non-grass-fed beef steak? 
A quick search on NutritionData shows that a similar gram-weight 
of grass-fed steak has more niacin, folates, B6, and pantothenic acid, 
sometimes by a magnitude of two or three, than the other steak 
(http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/10525/2). The 
exception is B12: both are good B12 sources, and the conventional 
steak provides almost all you need. 
Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for several enzymes. These include molecules that 
help synthesize DNA and build hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the 
blood throughout the body. This is why B12 deficiencies can lead to anemia, 
an inadequate number of red blood cells.
Vitamin B12 is mostly found in animal products like fish (including good 
sources like shellfish), beef, turkey, and chicken, as well as dairy products like 
eggs, milk, and cheese. Plant foods do not contain B12, so vegetarians have 
to obtain it by eating dairy products or with supplements. Two pastured 
eggs, hard-boiled, and a cup of whole milk will get you all the way there.
The RDAs for B12 are 2.4 mcg for adults, and a bit more for pregnant or  
lactating moms.39
Vitamin C
Also called ascorbic acid, this vitamin from fresh fruits and veggies is pivotal 
for many reasons, which is why you were harangued so much as a child to 
eat your apples and drink your OJ. For one, it is essential for synthesizing the 
protein-containing structural component of ligaments, bones, tendons, and 
blood vessels called collagen (see the accompanying sidebar on vitamin C). 
The body also uses vitamin C “as a cofactor for catecholamine biosynthesis, in 
particular the conversion of dopamine to [the neurotransmitter] norepineph-
rine,” according to an article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.40
Vitamin C is a powerful aqueous-based antioxidant. It helps mop up the 
reactive oxygen species in the watery parts of cells. It also helps recharge 
vitamin E after that vitamin has neutralized oxidative stress in the fatty parts 
of cells, such as their membranes.

Vitamins
Vitamin C deficiency is infamous for causing scurvy, a potentially fatal dis-
ease that beset British sailors in the 17th and 18th centuries, and it still rears 
its ugly head in the modern world. 
Vitamin C: Helps Keep Your Tissues and Fat-Burning Capabilities 
Intact
“I love vitamin C, it’s so interest-
ing, and totally unappreciated,” 
Carol Johnston, a Ph.D., nutri-
tion professor, and vitamin C 
researcher at Arizona State 
University in Phoenix, confided 
one afternoon in late September 
2011. “Vitamin D gets all the 
press right now, but here we 
have a major vitamin C issue going on.” 
She was talking about some National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2004 that showed 
31 percent of Americans to be either scorbutic (with vitamin 
C blood levels indicating scurvy) or with “marginal vitamin 
C status” (meaning that “your body tissues are not operat-
ing optimally because there is too little of vitamin C there 
for optimal pathways and metabolism”). 
She had me convinced; vitamin C is perhaps “the new vita-
min D,” in terms of the attention we should be paying it.
Vitamin C must be present to produce collagen, the super-
strong connective tissue protein in tendons, cartilage, 
bone, and blood vessels. However, collagen has an impor-
tant immune system role as well, according to Johnston. 
“We have defense collagens, little toll-like receptors on 
immune cells that actually recognize pathogens,” Johnston 
explained. People who are deficient in vitamin C (up to 
a third of Americans) have a “marginalized ability to stay 
infection free.”
Vitamin C is also a cofactor for making carnitine, a pivotal 
protein that shuttles fatty acids into the cells mitochondria 
to be burned for energy. “Some of the fatigue associated 
with early marginal C status could be related to carnitine 
[depletion],” Johnston said, because your metabolic system 
for using fats for energy is compromised. 
The fatigue “could [also] be related to norepinephrin,” 
she said. “No one’s really looked at that” from a scientific 
research standpoint. Vitamin C is necessary for the produc-
tion of norepinephrine, which the adrenal glands release as 
part of the fight or flight response. It’s also a neurotransmit-
ter that affects how the heart contracts.
The typical adult stores about 1,500 mg of vitamin C in her 
body, according to Johnston, mostly in the liver and adrenal 
glands. 
What about bioavailability? Are you getting as much vita-
min C to your tissues as you think you are? “Some nutrients 
are more stable than C, C is fragile," Johnston said. “I think 
the nutrient composition tables overestimate vitamin C 
intakes by what we consider to be significant margins.” 
And what about the mega doses some people shoot for, 
such as 40–50 times the RDA for C? “Vitamin C requires 
a transporter and you can saturate that pretty quickly,” 
Johnston explained. “When you start taking over 200–500 
mg you are really decreasing the amount you can absorb. 
I don’t see a lot of benefit in consuming those high doses 
if you want to maximize tissue storage. You really need to 
take small amounts over the course of a day.” For example, 
you might take 200 mg two or three times per day—if you 
think you need that dose.
The bottom line is just, “keep eating those fresh fruits and 
veggies.”
During the 1941 siege of Leningrad in World War II, an epidemic of 
scurvy swept through Russian civilians, who’d been given only bread 
rations. Pine needles boiled in water (pine needle tea) helped stave it 
off, as pine needles are rich in vitamin C.41
The RDA for vitamin C is 90 mg per day for male adults and 75 mg for 
females, but supplements as well as fruits and veggies typically provide the 
body with far more than that amount. For children aged four and older, the

RDA rises incrementally from 25 mg to about 75 mg per day. Apples provide 
about 10 mg each, oranges about 68 mg, and a cup of lemon sections more 
than 100 mg, according to NutritionData. 
I’ve taken to eating lemons raw or adding raw sections to smoothies, 
because they are very high in vitamin C and low in fructose (see Chapter 3 
for a note on fructose) compared to a typical sweet apple. 
A medium-sized apple contains almost 11 grams of fructose (and 8.4 mg of 
vitamin C), compared with a medium lemon (less than 1.5 grams of fructose 
and about 31 mg of vitamin C). 
If you munched a clump of raw broccoli in a salad (however torturous 
that may sound to some), you’d derive about 66 mg of C, according to 
NutritionData.
Minerals
Essential minerals are inorganic substances from the earth that must be 
provided by the diet. They include calcium, phosphorus (phosphates), mag-
nesium, sulfur, sodium chloride (salt), and potassium, as well as the “trace” 
minerals of which fewer milligrams are required per day. These include iron, 
zinc, copper, manganese, iodine, selenium, fluoride, molybdenum, and 
chromium. 
You can get minerals from your MVM supplement, as well as from both food 
and beverages. For example, drinking water from streams or aquifers (e.g., a 
commercial mineral water) could provide some of the minerals needed by 
your body.
The adequacy of the minerals you derive from food is directly related to the 
mineral richness of the soil the food was grown in. This is why we included 
a chapter in this book on the filial loyalty you should display toward all your 
local farms. Some processed foods are also fortified with minerals, such as 
bread fortified with iron or orange juice with calcium. 
A whole-foods diet dominated by local vegetables and fruits that are in sea-
son or frozen at their peak of freshness, as well as healthy meats and cheeses, 
should provide many of the minerals you require in adequate amounts. 
Minerals, like vitamins, play numerous roles in the body that belie the quan-
tities consumed. Many minerals are constituents of life-giving molecules, 
like the iron in hemoglobin (red blood cells), which transports oxygen 
throughout the body; the phosphorus that is a part of adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP), which is the form of energy that our cells use; and the iodine 
that the thyroid gland uses to make thyroid hormone.

Micronutrients: Vitamins, Minerals, and Phytochemicals

Minerals
Macrominerals
These are the major minerals that are required in the body in quantities of 
about 100 milligrams or more per day: calcium, phosphorus (phosphates), 
magnesium, sulfur, sodium chloride (salt), and potassium.
Calcium
About four percent of the body’s weight is made up of minerals, with three 
quarters of that amount in calcium and phosphorus.42 The vast majority of 
calcium resides in the bones and teeth, but calcium also plays a critical role 
in the extracellular fluid, among other places. Along with other biochemicals, 
calcium affects the permeability of cell membranes during the exchange of 
substances like oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste products. 
Calcium’s function is so important in the extracellular fluid that if you don’t 
have enough calcium in your bodily fluids, the body will free up calcium 
from your bones, or “demineralize” them. This is why it is important to get 
enough calcium in your diet.
Vitamin D and calcium work together
Once the body senses a calcium deficit, it releases parathyroid hormone, 
which signals the kidneys to produce more of the active form of vitamin D. 
The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, stimulates the absorption of calcium 
from any food in the small intestine, as well as the demineralization of bone 
if the latter source is inadequate. You can see how vitamin D and calcium 
work together. 
Adults and adolescents should get about 1,000 to 1,300 mg per day of cal-
cium (the RDA for pregnant and lactating moms over 18 years of age is 1,000 
mg). Good sources of calcium are dairy (milk, cheese, and yogurt), as well as 
green vegetables like spinach and Swiss chard. 
However, vegetables such as spinach, while containing a lot of calcium, also 
contain large amounts of oxalic acid, which can bind with and prevent the 
absorption of calcium. (See the upcoming sidebar “Going Against the Grains: 
Plants Contain Antinutrients.”) Cooking breaks down the oxalates, which 
generally do not prevent the absorption of calcium from other foods you are 
eating at the same time, like cheese or yogurt.
Magnesium 
Magnesium is required by the chemical reactions that make ATP, our primary 
energy currency, in the mitochondria of cells, according to the Linus Pauling 
Institute (http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/magnesium/). The 
adult human body includes about 25 grams of magnesium, mostly in bones. 
The synthesis of glutathione, a natural antioxidant in the body, requires mag-
nesium. Magnesium also plays a structural role in bone, cell membranes, and 

Minerals

chromosomes, according to LPI. And it goes on and on. Obviously, you have 
to get enough magnesium in your diet.
The magnesium RDA for males (i.e., the minimum amount you should get, 
give, or take) is 420 mg per day, and for females it’s 320 mg per day. According 
to NutritionData, here are some examples of common magnesium sources:
• 2 cups coffee: 14.2 mg
• 2 squares baking chocolate: 190 mg
• 8 ounces grass-fed ground beef: 38 mg
• 8 ounces whole milk: 24.4 mg
• 1 cup spinach: 23.7 mg
• 1 cup Swiss chard: 150 mg
• 5–6 ounce filet of haddock: 75 mg 
• 2 ounces cheddar: 15.6
• 2 Florida oranges: 28.2 mg
Cacao, a good source of which is high-cacao chocolate, is a rich source of 
magnesium. The surprising sources to me were chard and haddock, provid-
ing about half of all you would need in a day. Oranges are also a surprisingly 
good small source.
This exercise is also a good indication that you can derive your nutrition from 
commonly eaten whole foods, which obviously contain far more vitamins, 
minerals, and phytochemicals than just magnesium.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus is another major nutrient for your bones; about 85 percent of 
this mineral in the body is found there. A phosphates-and fatty acid–containing 
structure called phospholipids is a principal component of all body cell mem-
branes. Last but not least, the primary energy currency of the body, a mol-
ecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), also contains this mineral, as do 
DNA and RNA, which are long chains of phosphate-containing molecules.43
Phosphorus has the same interaction with vitamin D as calcium when the 
body detects blood levels falling beneath a certain level. Parathyroid hor-
mone sends the message to increase the generation of the active form of 
vitamin D in the kidneys, which in turn increases the amount of phosphates 
(and calcium) absorbed from the intestines.
People generally get enough phosphorus in their diets, which unfortunately 
includes the burden of food additives that contain phosphates. The RDA for 
phosphorus is about 700 mg per day for adults and 1,250 mg for children 
between 9 and 18 years old. Good natural sources (nonfood additives) of 

Micronutrients: Vitamins, Minerals, and Phytochemicals

Minerals
phosphorus are milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs, meat, and fish.44 A vegan, how-
ever, eschewing both meat and dairy products, may have trouble getting 
enough phosphorus in her diet. 
Potassium
People should generally keep their potassium to sodium (or salt) intake ratio 
at about 4 to 1. In other words, you should get about four times as many 
milligrams of potassium as salt. Researchers have pointed out that we’re 
ultimately designed to have a high potassium-to-sodium ratio in our diet, 
and recent studies have underlined this point. 
“Americans who eat a diet high in sodium and low in potassium have a 50 
percent increased risk of death from any cause, and about twice the risk of 
death from heart attacks,” according to a study published in July 2011 in the 
Archives of Internal Medicine.45
Here’s a good list of useful potassium food sources with great potassium-to-
sodium ratios:
• Medium-sized kiwi: 237:2
• 5–6 ounces salmon: 967:86
• One large stalk cooked broccoli: 820:115
• 4 ounces grass-fed ground bison: 353:76
• Medium-sized lemon: 80:1
• One cup raw spinach: 167:24
• California avocado: 689 mg:11
• One cup raspberries: 186:1
• One cup cherry tomatoes: 147:3
• One cup blueberries: 114:1
• One medium-sized banana: 422 mg:1
In other words, a small piece of wild salmon gives you about 1,000 mg (or 1 
gram) of potassium, and confers a potassium-to-sodium ratio of more than 
10:1.
So what does potassium do? The concentration of potassium inside a cell 
is about 10 times the concentration outside, and for sodium the ratio is 
reversed (other sources have different estimates for this concentration).46 
This creates a conveyor belt or “ion pump” across cellular membranes, a 
gradient that enables the basic machinery throughout the body: nerve cell 
signals, muscle contractions, the heart’s cardiac output, as well as the trans-
port of glucose fuel, for example, from outside to inside the cell.

An endurance athlete can run dangerously low on potassium, and this is 
partly what causes any muscle spasms and cramps.
Adults require about 4,700 mg per day of potassium (children less than 14 
years old need 3,000–4,500 mg per day). It is relatively easy to derive your 
necessary potassium from a whole foods diet, as the above list shows.
Sodium chloride (salt)
Along with potassium, salt makes up the sodium-potassium pump that is 
a basic part of cellular mechanisms (e.g., nerve transmission and muscle 
contraction). 
You should consume less salt than potassium, at a ratio of about 4 to 1 in 
potassium’s favor (see “Potassium”). 
Although conventional wisdom blames excess salt for high blood pressure 
and other problems, and most people on the Standard American Diet (SAD; 
note the pejorative expression) consume a lot of salt in their processed 
foods, it is still an essential mineral in physiology.
People have become sick and even died during long endurance contests 
by excessively diluting the salt content of their bodies with chronic exces-
sive hydration (a condition known as hyponatremia). Even some of the best 
endurance athletes, marathoners, and long-distance triathletes have arrived 
at the finish line so depleted that they have to immediately receive an intra-
venous saline or sodium-chloride solution.
Along with potassium, salt is one of the important electrolytes of the body.
That said, it is easy to derive enough salt from whole nutritious foods (pas-
tured eggs, high-quality cheeses, large salads, an electrolyte drink during a 
triathlon) without ever dusting your food with table salt. 
Sulfur
The amino acids cysteine and methionine (two of the building blocks of 
proteins) contain most of the sulfur that the body uses. Therefore, if you’re 
getting enough protein in your diet, you should be getting enough of the 
mineral sulfur.
Trace Minerals
Trace minerals are the minerals that we have to consume in our diet, drink-
ing water, and/or a supplement in relatively small amounts. That’s not to 
say they are unimportant, though; see the upcoming sidebar on zinc and 
antinutrients, for example, or consider that iron represents the “heme” part 
of hemoglobin, our red blood cells that carry oxygen, and that selenium is a 
major antioxidant in the body.

Minerals
Like the macrominerals, the microminerals include common elements that 
you will recognize from the periodic table (if you ever paid attention in 
Chemistry class). We’re just going to list the microminerals here, with helpful 
links for more details. The recommended levels for them range from around 
10 milligrams to levels in the micrograms (1/1000 of a milligram, as in 55 
mcg per day of selenium). 
Copper
The RDA for this mineral is 890 to 900 mcg per day (www.nlm.nih.gov/
medlineplus/ency/article/002419.htm).
Iodine
The RDA for this mineral is 150 mcg per day for adults (http://ods.od.nih.

Iron
The RDA for this mineral is 8 mg per day for males and 18 mg/day for 
adult females (http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/iron/).
Manganese
The AI level for this mineral is 2.3 mg/day for adult males, and 1.8 mg 
for females (http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/manganese/). 
Molybdenum
The RDA for this mineral is 45 mcg per day for adults (http://lpi.oregon-

Selenium
The RDA for selenium is 55 mcg for adults, 60 mcg for pregnant women, 
and 70 mcg for lactating moms (http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium/). 
Zinc
The RDA for zinc is 11 mg for adult males and 8 mg/day for females 
(http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-QuickFacts).

minerals, for the most part (but you shouldn’t be). Following is a description

Going Against the Grains: Plants Contain “Antinutrients”
Despite their mute passivity, 
plants don’t really want to be 
eaten. They don’t have claws 
or teeth (at least most of them 
don’t) and they can’t run away as 
predators pursue them. In com-
pensation, however, wheat, oats, 
rice, soy beans, various nuts, and 
many veggies like spinach are 
laden with chemicals scientists have labeled antinutrients. 
These phytochemicals are meant to help the plants play 
tough defense—i.e., to make them unpalatable to herbi-
vores (like us). 
Antinutrients are “compounds that prevent nutrients (e.g., 
minerals and proteins) from either being absorbed or 
utilized,” according to Dr. Venket Rao, a professor with the 
Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of To-
ronto who did some of the original research on these food 
chemicals several decades ago. 
A cautionary event that placed antinutrients on the nu-
tritional map was an “epidemic of dwarfism” in the 1960s 
in Egypt, Iran, and Turkey. It was caused by a poisonous 
combination of too much unleavened bread, like pita, and a 
lack of meats to provide the lost zinc. 
Phytates, or phytic acid, in the bread bind with zinc in our 
digestive tracts and prevent the mineral’s absorption. They 
also bind with iron and calcium. The unleavened bread (the 
leavening process breaks up the phytates) “caused massive 
zinc deficiencies,” according to Rao. “Zinc is essential for 
growth.” 
Zinc supplements cured the epidemic, but the outbreak 
showed how insidious phytates and other antinutrients 
could be when consumed in a diet that lacks micronutrients 
from varied sources.
Soybeans contain antinutrients called lectins, which 
prevent carbohydrate utilization; saponins, a natural soapy 
substance that the plant uses as part of its own immunity 
against invading organisms; as well as a class of toxin called 
protease inhibitors. 
Saponins can wipe out red blood cells if they come in con-
tact with the blood system, rupturing the cell membranes 
in a very bad event called hemolysis.
Protease enzymes like trypsin are essential enzymes for 
the digestion of protein; therefore, consuming protease 
inhibitors in excessive amounts will deplete the amount of 
protein you can metabolize.
I asked Professor Rao about oxalic acid, which both raw 
spinach and dark chocolate contain (both of which I hap-
pened to have munched that day). “Oxalic acid binds to 
calcium, iron, and magnesium,” he said. “Are you a coffee 
drinker?” (Oh, oh). Caffeic acid from too much joe will cause 
you to pee out excessive amounts of calcium.
On balance, the phytochemicals, which is a broad term that 
includes the specified antinutrients, are very good for us 
(see the “Antioxidants: Cultivate Your Inner Nerf” sidebar). 
Instead of consuming bushels of raw spinach and barrels of 
joe, keep your diet varied, mixed, and sensible. For example, 
I also asked Rao about someone who drinks soy milk every 
day because he doesn’t get along with cow’s milk (i.e., he is 
lactose intolerant). “Drinking one glass of soy milk on a daily 
basis does not pose any problem. The levels of the phyto-
chemicals will not be too high.” 
“Many phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals have defi-
cient levels of intake, optimal levels, and doses that may not 
be good for you,” Rao added.
Soaked, fermented, and sprouted foods involve prepara-
tions that will help remove most of the 
antinutrients. In fact, it’s worth it to 
do a little research by Googling 
“sprouted and fermented 
foods.” For example, here is 
an informative post from the 
excellent Whole Health Source 
blog: http://wholehealthsource.

its protein, fat, and carbohydrate content (the macronutrients), along with 
very detailed information on micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Figure

Although presented as a weight-loss and dieting site, FitDay (www.fitday.

the associated micronutrient content, or lack thereof. 
As a way of demonstrating how you can derive a vitamin and mineral profile 
for junk food—sorry, treats—from a vending machine and a fast-food joint, 
let’s enter these foods into FitDay and see what results the software displays.

Imagine you start off the day with a 12-ounce take-out coffee for breakfast; 
then later on you raid the vending machine for peanut butter crackers, some 
potato chips, and a package of Reese’s Pieces, which you mercifully leave 
only partially consumed. All this is washed down with a can of Red Bull. 
Finally, you top off the late afternoon by visiting the local fast food empori-
um and leaving with a Double Whopper and fries, with a vanilla shake in tow. 
Figure 4-5 shows this fearsome lineup, as entered in FitDay.
Considering that only the bottom three items even remotely resemble an 
edible meal, one of the many data points that leaps off the page and begs 
for your attention is the calorie total: more than 3,000. The problem is that 
this chow-down represents a person’s consumption for only part of the day.

A mere 3 ounces of wheat crackers with peanut butter filling packs a pretty 
good wallop at 422 calories, considering that this snack is just a prelude for 
the heavy hitters that come afterward. 
The table shows a lot of fat here, but it’s the type of fat that counts, as 
explained in Chapter 3. For example, the coconut milk that is part of a 
smoothie will tip the fat scale on FitDay, but this nutritious snack contains a 
portion of its fats in the form of lauric acid (which is a component of human 
breast milk).

More of the bad to middling news comes on the Nutrition tab, which you 
can click on at the bottom of the page. Figure 4-6 shows this revealing table, 
indicating that the substances you gobbled up and guzzled down bore little 
resemblance to the food our forebears sustained themselves on.
Figure 4-6. Vitamins are no-shows in a FitDay profile
The meal contains no vitamin A or D, and just enough C to perhaps prevent 
scurvy (but not for long). The table shows the RDA for each nutrient and the 
% RDA represented by the analyzed food. For example, the 201 adjacent to 
vitamin B6 indicates that the food contained about twice the recommended 
daily minimum amount of that nutrient. Deficits for a nutrient appear in red; 
it’s all pretty simple to read and understand.
The good mineral profile here undoubtedly derives from the meat in 
the Double Whopper. This industrially mass-produced meat is far from 
a one-sided picture, however, as we saw in Chapter 3. For example, the 
meat probably came from a concentrated animal feeding operation 
(CAFO), and is not as healthy, to say the least, as meat from grazing 
animals that might be pastured near your town or city.

This motley collection of packaged chow contained just a fragment of the 
necessary vitamin E, which, along with the dearth of vitamin C, leaves you 
with few antioxidants to clean up after the day’s stresses (except for the 
selenium). 
A diet like this will leave the body quivering and inflamed, given that the 
“fake” food contained almost zero phytochemicals with their associated 
antioxidants (see the “Antioxidants: Cultivate Your Inner Nerf” sidebar.) This 
means that some of the cellular damage, including of DNA, goes unchecked 
throughout the day.
The “meal” contained almost 1,200 calories’ worth of carbs, many of which 
were represented by simple sugars like sucrose and fructose, jacking up the 
inflammatory effects of an excess sugar load.
Needs work: Potassium to sodium ratio
Another piece of data worth mentioning is the potassium to sodium ratio. 
Instead of the desirable ratio of about 4 to 1, this ratio was more like 0.84 to 
1; in other words, the vending machine grazer is getting much more sodium 
than potassium, which has potentially dire effects down the road (see the 
“Potassium” section earlier in this chapter).
Of course, the point of this tongue-in-cheek exercise (no one really eats like 
this, right? Honest?) is to show FitDay’s useful, revealing, and sometimes 
sobering metrics when it comes to micronutrients. Once you get over the 
tedium of entering foods, the tool is fun to play with, and it gives you a pre-
cise enough micronutrient picture of your current food intake. It doesn’t deal 
with bioavailability (what quantities of these food nutrients actually make 
their way out of the gastrointestinal tract and to the body’s target tissues), 
so you can only use tables like these for general guidance.
See Chapter 2 for more details on FitDay.

Sports Performance Probably Gets a Boost from Vitamin D
Ever since the 1950s, when top German and Russian ath-
letes were irradiated with ultraviolet light to boost their vi-
tamin D levels, the European continent’s scientific literature 
has shown that vitamin D biosynthesis and supplementa-
tion may provide a sports performance edge. 
The active form of vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that 
boosts athletic performance when the athlete is brought 
out of a D-deficient state, which probably applies to most 
athletes, according to Dr. John Cannell, the executive direc-
tor of the Vitamin D Council. Cannell recently wrote a jour-
nal report based on the older European medical literature.
“Many of the papers came out of elite sports institutes run 
by Germans and Russians,” according to Cannell, whose 
paper “Athletic Performance and Vitamin D” was pub-
lished in 2009 in the journal Medicine and Science In Sports 
and Exercise. You can find it here: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/19346976. 
“The higher the D level [they found in the athletes] the bet-
ter their cardiovascular fitness.”
The medical literature indicates that boosting vitamin D 
levels in athletes will improve speed, strength, balance, 
and timing; the athletes who can achieve optimal levels 
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in their blood will have a better 
“choice reation time,” according to Cannell. 
Cannell told me in an email message that “lean body mass 
and strength are both increased with [better] D [levels in 
the body],” but that he did not know the exact physiological 
mechanism by which D exerted that effect.
“If you start with D-deficient athletes the effect is dramatic,” 
Cannell said in a radio interview in August 2011. He views 
a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 50 ng/ml as optimal 
(higher than U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines). 
“Most athletes are deficient” in vitamin D, Cannell specu-
lates, since the typical tested person usually has a serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level of far less than 50 ng/ml. 
Most people require 5,000 IU per day of vitamin D3 to reach 
the 50-ng/ml level, according to Cannell. He “suspects that 
athletes need more than that” because of “metabolic clear-
ance.” A marathon runner or active cross-trainer is going to 
use up more vitamin D in her cells than a couch potato.
“Once you get over 50 ng/ml [in a person’s test results] you 
start measuring some vitamin D (the inactive form that isn’t 
typically tested for) in the blood, meaning the body has all 
the 25-hydroxyvitamin D it needs and is storing some for 
later use. It’s also the level where pregnant women have 
[lots of] vitamin D in breast milk. It’s often the level that 
lifeguards have, about 50 ng/ml.”

Before you get the wrong impression, this chapter will not be dominated by 
descriptions of power apps that go and find great healthy food for you. For 
this activity, we’ll rely on the “wet app” that resides between our ears, and the 
accumulated wisdom that lives, metaphorically, somewhere in the vicinity of 
our solar plexus. The “gut feel,” in other words. 
Sure, we’ll mention a few food-choice apps later on, like Fooducate, 
GroceryIQ, and Restaurant Finder. You can find other food-shopping 
apps such as the ones that help with grocery lists at www.appbrain.
com (see www.appbrain.com/search?q=food+shopping for a list of 
them), or www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/lifestyle.html 
for the iPhone.
The point is that a few rules of thumb, like “eat local, real food,” or some of 
food author Michael Pollan’s rules (summarized in the sidebar “Choice Food 
Rules from a Food Writer”), along with some well-known tips on managing a 
supermarket’s tactics, will get you a longer way toward fitness than punch-
ing out choices on an app screen.
Ultimately, the best food app around would be the one that reads a label 
from your phone or recognizes a shape and simply spits out an accurate 
“Yes!” or “No!” But that one doesn’t exist yet (Fooducate does represent a 
similar concept, though). 
Eat Local: Leave the Big Boxes for the Extras
People apply a number of criteria when they seek food, including conve-
nience, palatability (“It tastes good”), and cultural habit (“Mom always made 
me a PB&J for lunch, so that’s what I’m going to make myself”). I’m going to 
add a fourth one: eating for fitness. This is a fitness book after all, and food is 
at least 50 percent of the game.

Eat Local: Leave the Big Boxes for the Extras

Our bodies have tens of trillions of cells, and millions of them turn over 
every day, even every second (your body makes millions of new red 
blood cells each day alone; the whole kit and caboodle of them turns 
over every four months!). In other words, you’re constantly growing 
new parts of your body, specifically at the cellular level. Many of the 
ingredients for new cells, such as the fatty acids for cell membranes 
and the amino acids for new proteins (that go into everything, includ-
ing the membranes), have to come from the foods you eat.
When done right, the eat-local strategy can take care of the first three crite-
ria: convenience, taste, and habit. 
There are also lots of environmental and energy-related reasons for 
eating local, and those certainly are legit. There are practical, even 
dystopian reasons too: what if the roads are washed out or destroyed 
by an extreme weather event, or there’s a systemic collapse, and only 
locally produced or frozen food is available?
Eating local means for the most part focusing on real food from farmer’s 
markets, local farms, and even your own garden. Then augment those pur-
chases by getting other stuff (e.g., paper goods; big bags of rice; high-cacao 
chocolate bars; those avocados, kiwis, or lemons that aren’t grown locally; 
or a glass container of OJ) at the big-box supermarket chains, if you choose 
to go to them at all.
Before you go ballistic and accuse me of hypocrisy (sure, I do patronize 
supermarkets once in a while—mea culpa), I do know people who get 
all their food from organic gardens, farms, and their own hunting.
This chapter also discusses:
• Navigating the shoals of the modern big-box supermarket
• Hacks for finding food when you are on the road
• Strategies for choosing food when you’re on a really tight budget, which 
is the case for increasing numbers of us throughout the world
Eating local means for the most 
part focusing on real food from 
farmer’s markets, local farms, 
and even your own garden.

Choice Food Rules from a Food Writer
“Every trip to the supermar-
ket these days requires us to 
navigate what has become a 
truly treacherous food land-
scape,” Michael Pollan writes in 
an October 2009 New York Times 
article called “Rules to Eat By” 
(www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/
magazine/11food-rules-t.
html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1318334774-s68ZUNcP1I9Nbm0N-
HDIQXA). 
“I mean, what are we to make of a wonder of food science 
like the new Splenda with fiber? (‘The great sweet taste you 
want and a little boost of fiber.’) Should we call this prog-
ress? Is it even food?
“How did humans manage to choose foods and stay 
healthy before there were nutrition experts and food 
pyramids or breakfast cereals promising to improve your 
child’s focus or restaurant portions bigger than your head? 
We relied on culture, which is another way of saying: on the 
accumulated wisdom of the tribe. (Which is itself another 
way of saying: on your mom and your friends.)”
Based on hundreds of entries from readers of the article, 
Pollan put together numerous favorite food rules, a few of 
which are reproduced below:
• “It’s better to pay the grocer than the doctor.”
• “Don’t eat anything you aren’t willing to kill yourself.”
• “Avoid snack foods with the ‘oh’ sound in their names: 
Doritos, Fritos, Cheetos, Tostitos.
• “Eat foods in inverse proportion to how much its lobby 
spends to push it.”
• “If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, then you 
are not hungry.”
• “Never eat something that is pretending to be something 
else: veggie burgers, margarine, artificial sweeteners.
• “Don’t eat anything that took more energy to ship than 
grow.”

Choosing Foods Locally
The main reasons for focusing on local farms and gardens are that:
• The food is probably more nutritious because it’s not as old, it hasn’t 
been transported thousands of miles (a variation of the latter point), and 
the soil richness of the small farm may be superior to that of big indus-
trial farms that have depleted the minerals in their farmland through 
high crop yields over the generations (there are exceptions of course, 
and few farms are perfect—wash all the food!).
• For the same reason why you might consider getting a mortgage at the 
bank down the street, using the local car garage, or quaffing your morn-
ing joe at the Hippie Gal Café rather than the mall (sorry, Starbucks)— 
supporting local food producers makes for a stronger community.
A study of California’s San Joaquin Valley from the 1940’s compared 
corporate farms, small farms, and their effects on the surrounding 
communities. “Where family farms predominated, there were more 
local businesses, paved streets and sidewalks, schools, parks, churches, 
clubs and newspapers, better services, higher employment and more 
civic participation. Studies conducted since Goldschmidt’s original 
work confirms that his findings remain true today” (see www.mind-
fully.org/Farm/Small-Farm-Benefits-Rosset.htm).

Almost every small to sizeable community has one or more local farms with 
a food stand. In recent years, many of these operations have grown in size 
and become year-round stores with expanded services, like pick-your-own, a 
dairy case (with all that raw milk, artisan cheese, and jerky based on regional 
game meat), and little farm versions of petting zoos.
A farm store I go to in Newburyport, Massachusetts has a bison that 
hangs around in a corral as the local mascot. Can Walmart do that?
Of course, in the winter months at northern latitudes, these operations have 
to ship in a lot of their produce, so the produce will often be no better than a 
supermarket’s. However, in my experience, it’s usually very clear which food 
is local and which is not, because the farm has an incentive to crow about 
its produce.
Local eggs that are pastured are also much more nutritious than a typical 
factory-bred egg, despite what its label says about “Omega 3 Eggs” and 
the like (and it’s less disgusting to think about how the chicken that laid 
them lives). See the “Good Neighbor Sam’s Eggs Are Healthier” sidebar and 
Chapter 3 on Omega 3 fats. 
When your whole family goes to the farm, children in particular begin to 
finally learn where real food comes from, gradually recovering from the mis-
conception of food as a shrink-wrapped “product” down the aisle from the 
DVDs, the motor oil, and the ammunition.
Farmer’s Markets
Almost every small-town square and many cities now have farmer’s markets 
on the weekends. New York City alone has 53 different markets throughout 
its boroughs.1 Many of them, or their organizers, have websites and calendars. 
To find these markets, just Google your location and “farmer’s market,” or 
check out the local paper. Fill up a bag or two with lettuce, carrots, potatoes, 
apples, eggs, honey, grass-fed beef and lamb, etc., on Saturday or Sunday, 
and that will keep you going at least through Tuesday.
The farmer’s markets also tend to be park-like events in their own right—
outdoors, kid-friendly places to hang out, with music playing, lots of dogs 
to pet, and even a few nearby Occupy Together folks to bat around some 
philosophical concepts with.
Community Supported Agriculture
Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) programs allow consumers to buy 
a share of a farm’s produce for a season. The farm relies on CSAs as a form 
of insurance (the consumer shares the risk that the crop could be limited 
that year), while the consumer has a steady supply of produce or meats and 
makes a small investment in sustainable local food production where she lives. 
Almost every small-town square 
and many cities now have

Food Hacks: Finding and Choosing Food

Eat Local: Leave the Big Boxes for the Extras
CSAs have become very popular; you’ll see them advertised at many of your 
local farms and elsewhere.
These food arrangements come in all shapes and sizes. I had one during the 
winter that was meat-only, including a whole chicken once per month. CSAs 
usually offer full shares (for a family of four to six) and half shares (feeding 
about two). Sometimes they involve a stand of veggies to pick from (the 
usual case), or a crate of food that you pick up on a specified day once per week. 
Some CSAs are a combination of small producers who band together to sell 
their wares. Many farms simply have their own CSAs, summer and winter 
ones, yet other CSAs grow no food but buy all their produce from a collection 
of farms.
Most of the time you get more produce than you can eat, so it becomes 
something you share with your friends (or you’re impelled to glom all the 
produce together and make stews, which is good). A bit like the fitness 
gadgets discussed in Chapter 2, the CSAs have a “tail wags the dog” effect. 
Having a regular supply of fresh local produce that you’ve already paid for 
encourages you to eat more of it and therefore adopt a healthier diet, in 
terms of antioxidants and other phytochemicals (see Chapter 4). You know 
you’ve got food to finish at home, and thus shouldn’t stop for that sub on 
the way back from work.
Your Own Victory or Rooftop Garden
Victory Gardens are making a comeback, with the skyrocketing price of 
food these days. In the 1940s, the U.S. government was rationing foods like 
sugar, butter, and canned goods to aid in the World War II effort, so it urged 
the American people to plant their own gardens and provide as much of 
their own fruits and vegetables as possible. This led to an explosion of small, 
efficient food production in backyards and on city rooftops, as independent 
food production had a sense of purpose and history behind it.2 
That all changed when we became Fast Food Nation, but a new direction 
seems to be in the air during our 21st-century version of hard times, where 
the “insta-food” might be cheap (and salty, and sugary), but the gas trans-
portation and car ownership required to get there isn’t. People are back to 
growing their own food, keeping their own chickens, and devising other 
solutions for cutting the costs of their daily calories. It’s called survival. See 
“Code Crash: Choosing Food in Hard Times” up ahead.
Local eggs that are pastured are 
also much more nutritious than 
a typical factory-bred egg.

Community Gardens
Another choice for people who don’t have enough sunny property to plant 
their own gardens is the community garden. In this variation of growing 
food, a town or cooperative divides up some available land into small plots 
that you plant with vegetables or flowers. The cost of renting or acquiring 
a plot is usually very cheap. Depending on the community, you can get a 
15-foot by 15-foot plot for around $20 total (and smaller plots for less). A 
friend of mine tells me that the only downside is that you might have neigh-
bors that use nasty pesticides that you don’t want near your vegetables, but 
that the overall effect is that you end up with more fresh food than you need, 
and the community-garden vibe is a pleasant and congenial one.
Good Neighbor Sam’s Eggs Are Healthier
The next time you snicker at that frenetic gaggle of chickens your neighbor 
keeps in his front yard, consider their high efficiency as a food source. A “free 
ranging” chicken—one that scampers around pecking grass, seeds, and 
insects—lays much more nutritious eggs than a caged factory chicken. 
Good neighbor Sam’s eggs are virtually vitamin pills residing in a shell. Ac-
cording to the Mother Earth News, here’s how pasture-raised eggs compare 
with “standard factory farm eggs”: beta carotene—79 mcg vs. 20 mcg; 
vitamin A—792 IU vs. 487 IU; n-3 fatty acids—0.66 grams vs. 0.22 grams; and 
vitamin E—3.7 mg vs. 1 mg. The pastured eggs also tend to be much higher in 
vitamin D, according to the Mother Earth News tests. For more information, see 
www.motherearthnews.com/eggs.aspx.
Choosing Food in the Meat Space: Navigating 
the Modern Supermarket’s Shoals
When you walk into a supermarket or a farm, both entities view you as a 
“food consumer” (they both need money, or perhaps some sort of barter 
or exchange in the case of the farm), but there the comparison ends. The 
farm hasn’t hired a big-name consulting firm to polish its marketing tactics 
in order to lure the poor Mr. (or Mrs.) Moms dragging their two bawling kids 
inside to blow their hard-earned cash on more stuff they don’t need. 
Supermarkets have well-known strategies for manipulating the psychology 
of their customers. Most geeks, and food shoppers in general, resent any 
thought of being manipulated (they want complete control over their own 
behavior and purse strings); therefore, the purpose of this section is to rec-
ommend some alternatives to the supermarket’s strategies, which, for the 
most part, are plastered all over the Internet anyway.

Food Hacks: Finding and Choosing Food

Choosing Food in the Meat Space: Navigating the Modern Supermarket’s Shoals
Mastering the Layout
Supermarkets have well-known techniques of positioning products at eye 
level on shelves, and even placing catchy cereal boxes and other junk foods 
at the eye levels of children. A retail-trade article I found on the Web even 
had a term for this form of using children as a bludgeon against their par-
ents: the “pester effect.”
Even though most people, by word-of-mouth or muckraking consumer 
news spots, know all about this strategy, it still works. I still see kids badger-
ing their parents in the middle aisles to buy stuff for them: colored sprinkles 
or little boxes of sugar-flour admixtures that also contain plastic toys. 
The solution, of course, is to avoid the middle aisles of supermarkets, which 
don’t contain the essential foodstuffs anyway. You’ll find most of the real 
food around the periphery of stores. Or, if you can, avoid bringing children 
to supermarkets. Bring them to a farm and go pick some apples. Physically 
exhaust them, in a good way, under the sun.
How to Read Food Labels
From a 20-pound bag of rice to a 100-gram can of sardines, 
just about everything you buy in a supermarket has a 
“Nutrition Facts” label and an “Ingredients” label. I’ll give you 
a quick rundown on how to read these bits of packaging, as 
long as you realize that they don’t contain a fraction of the 
useful information you could get on the same food from 
NutritionData or FitDay (see Chapter 2). Follow along with 
this brief discussion by taking a gander at Figure 5-1, a label 
from a can of vegetarian beans.
The purpose of Nutrition Facts is basically to show you the 
macronutrient ratio of the food (how much fat, carbs, and 
protein it contains). This small bowl of beans is mostly salty 
carbohydrate. The serving size is 140 calories with 27 grams 
of carbs, so we can find out its carb percentage using the 
following equation: (27 x 4) / 140 = 77 percent. Carbs have 
about 4 calories per gram (protein has about 4 and fats 
have 9). 
The rest of the macronutrients include only about 24 
calories’ worth of protein and a tiny amount of fat (a sign 
that this food is supposed to be healthy, along with the 
advertisement proclaiming “No Animal Products,” but I’m 
not even going to enter that political minefield).
480 mg of salt is too high for such a small amount of food 
(with a calorie level of only about 1/15th of what a person 
would eat in a day), as is the 14 grams of sugar. 
Now on to the Ingredients information located at the very 
bottom of the label. This shows the ingredients in descend-
ing order of weight. So, we have water and beans and 
tomato paste, then the not-so-good brown sugar, sugar, 
and salt. At least most grandmothers could explain many 
of the ingredients (mustard bran might leave a few of 
them scratching their heads). And modified corn starch—
modified how? Turmeric is actually an extremely effective 
antioxidant spice chemical.
The bottom line is that you can use these labels as one 
minor criterion, and certainly not the only one, for choosing 
foods off the shelf.

It’s the Positioning, Stupid
Believe it or not, companies have to pay supermarkets high fees to get prime 
spots on the shelves for their products. These are called “slotting fees.” It gets 
more insipid. The front of the store is called the “chill” or “decompression 
zone.” Items such as flower stands, greeting-card sections, and DVD and gift-
card racks are designed to slow the customers down, so they’ll start making 
impulse purchases.3
The primary reason for supermarket bakeries is to fill the air with a bready 
aroma so that you’ll get hungry and buy more stuff (the store usually has 
enough bread on display from its favorite retail partners). 
The dairy—milk, eggs, butter, etc.—is kept in the back, which is designed 
to force the people heading for their purposeful milk-and-egg purchase to 
make their way through the middle aisles, or past the gift-card and maga-
zine racks, and the temptations therein. 
You can defeat the common 
subterfuges of the supermarket, 
which are mostly designed to 
separate a fool from his money, 
with common sense.

Choosing Food in the Meat Space: Navigating the Modern Supermarket’s Shoals
The fresh produce section is set up in front in order to convey an impression 
of freshness and health, even though a lot of the displayed food on top is 
the old worthless (nutritionally) stuff that the store is trying to get rid of first.4 
Is this starting to sound like “truthiness” on The Colbert Report? 
Conveying an impression or feeling of truth has a higher priority than 
the truth itself. Doesn’t it make more sense to aim for food purveyors 
that have less of an incentive to hide their true purposes (and where 
most of the resources are applied not to manipulation or subterfuge 
but to growing quality produce and meat)? 
One trade article wrote about the use of “retail theater” to sell more fish 
from a supermarket fish counter. “You don’t buy fish from a fish counter. You 
buy it from a refrigerated counter that is surrounded by trappings of the 
sea, images of trawlers and fishermen, and even the sound of waves and 
seagulls. You will leave the store with some fish, and your senses ringing 
from a trip to the seaside.”5
Hmm. I buy most of my fish from a fish market in Newburyport, MA, 
where you see real piles of fish being processed just beyond the coun-
ter, with people wearing hats, boots, and gloves (they’re not actors 
either!). A “fish-like” sound effect (fishiness?) isn’t necessary because a 
real coastline exists about two miles away. Most people in America live 
on coastlines, and almost all of them have access to real fish markets.
You can defeat the common subterfuges of the supermarket, which are 
mostly designed to separate a fool from his money, with common sense. 
It wouldn’t be fair to pick on just supermarkets. Everyone is trying to 
make extra money off us eaters, including all those boutique “natural” 
health-food stores that cater to exotic diets and deep pockets.
Even a few smartphone tools lend assistance, if you need apps to stand 
between yourself and your impulses. Here are a few guidelines:
• Stick to the periphery of a supermarket, where most of the essential stuff 
is located, like produce, dairy, and meat. Just make one circumlocution, 
bang! And you’re done. See the next tip.
• Try to set and break records for the fastest time spent doing a supermarket 
errand. Use a smartphone timer like Endomondo and try to break your 
last record. Make it a mission; “special ops shopping”—get in there and 
out of there as fast as you can. Endomondo will also accumulate your 
mileage as you dash purposefully around the store. I just used this tech-
nique, parking a nice walk away from the store (another fitness hack) 
and completing a purchase of fruit, nuts, coconut milk, and rice in less 
than 11 minutes (including waiting 3 minutes for checkout)—0.4 miles 
according to Endomondo on my Android phone.

• Use local, specialized fish markets and local bakeries, where the loaf was 
probably cooked that day (by somebody who lives in or near your town) 
and contains fewer if any additives or preservatives. If local bakeries 
used preservatives, why would they need “day-old” bread racks? (I used 
to love those for the day-old scones.)
• Use a grocery list, and stick to the list as you navigate the store. A smart-
phone grocery-list app might be handy here (see “Choosing Food in the 
Digital Space with Apps”).
• If you really want to program against your own impulses, only leave 
enough money in your checking account for the amount you plan to spend 
on food, before you even step into a supermarket. With online banking, 
this is very easy to do. Just transfer enough money into another savings 
or money-market account, leaving only the necessary sum in the ATM 
account, before you head off on your weekly shop. Don’t bring any extra 
cash, and only pay with the ATM card. That way, you’re punished for 
impulse buying by having to pay the bank an overdraft fee (now that’s a 
negative incentive for spending extra money!).
Choosing Food in the Digital Space with Apps
As you can imagine, the app space abounds with food-finding and analyzing 
tools. One of them is Locavore, a simple app for finding nearby farms and 
CSAs. It grabs your location and displays the fruits and veggies that are still 
in season there. It further gives you an option for finding a farm or CSA that 
carries the specified produce, showing all the places on a Google Map (with 
location information like addresses and websites). You can find that app at 
www.getlocavore.com.
All apps are limited by the databases they load, which may fall quickly 
out of date—or were never comprehensive to begin with. Apps cannot 
magically pick farms out of thin air like they can magically pinpoint 
your location (using your cell phone’s internal location software). I 
used Locavore in the parking lot of one of my local farms, and it did 
not locate or show the farm. It is free, however, so let’s not nit-pick.
GroceryIQ (groceryiq.com/mobile.aspx) is a pretty good free app for assem-
bling and saving your own grocery lists. It’s an app designed for a true 
grocery-list power user. The developers have thought about everything 
you’d want to do with a list, like email it and sync the list on your phone with 
your computer. They also have a nice barcode scanner for scanning in items, 
which are automatically categorized by aisle type (e.g., the deli counter) and 
added to the list. 
For me, making any kind of list beyond the use of a pencil and paper, how-
ever, is too laborious and typing-intensive.

I just keep the “list” in my head and go on a fast-paced, “special ops” 
shop.
The Restaurant Finder (www.therestaurantfinder.com) is a spartan, handy 
app for finding restaurants based on your current location, which makes it 
useful while you’re on the road. It gives you the option of searching for just 
seafood, Italian, or vegetarian restaurants, for example, in case you want to 
skip the flood of fast-food results. The app provides fairly accurate results 
and a Google Map for locating the restaurant.
Fooducate (www.fooducate.com/barcode-samples.html) is a barcode-scanning 
app that makes it pretty easy to get a snapshot with your smartphone of 
food quality in a grocery store. After a scan, it shows you a screen like the 
one shown in Figure 5-2, which gives the food a grade and points out some 
warning flags (like five+ teaspoons of sugar!).
Figure 5-2. A barcode scan result with Fooducate
Fooducate will recommend alternatives along the bottom of the screen, 
as shown in Figure 5-3. This is a handy app for initial food screening from a 
nutritional standpoint. Most geeks, however, might want to get into more 
precise data such as protein, fat, carb, and micronutrient content.

As you can imagine, there are hundreds of these apps, mostly in free

Hacks for Finding Good Food on the Road
It can be tough finding fitness-oriented foods when you are on the road. 
When you don’t want to settle for a lowest-common-denominator experi-
ence in airports (you know, your flight’s cancelled, so you give up and aim for 
the martinis and a giant meatball sub), you can consider these hacks instead.
Search Google for “Whole Foods” wherever you are, if you have access to a 
computer or smartphone. One time I was in Seattle, WA, looking for food 
the day before a mountain climb (I was responsible for stuff like nuts, fruit, 
cheese, and chocolate bars). After getting general directions to a market 
from the hotel, I promptly failed to find anything food-wise but coffee shops 
and restaurants. Seattle can be hard to negotiate by foot, because it has a 
freeway running straight through the city.

Code Crash: Choosing Food in Hard Times
Ironically, here I was seeking food to survive on a mountain, and I was 
falling flat on my face inside of civilization.
I wandered around in the vicinity of my hotel and the Space Needle in a near 
panic, until I finally ran into a Whole Foods Market on Westlake Avenue. I 
could have saved myself some grief and time beforehand by doing a simple 
search on the laptop before I left my hotel.
Bring a nut-and-seed bag when you’re in the plane, bus, or rented car. Fill up 
a large Ziploc bag and keep it in your backpack or duffel. Nuts and seeds are 
filling, nutritious, lightweight, don’t require refrigeration, and won’t go bad 
for an entire trip (dried fruit, by the way, is no better than candy). Choose 
raw nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and macadamias over the roasted and 
salted variety, as this is a processing method that compromises the nutrition 
of the nuts and seeds (the latter including sunflower and pumpkin). Apples 
and carrots are also more durable and transportable than other fresh foods.
Use travel time for fasting, particularly on planes. It’s a “when in doubt, don’t 
eat” moment (see Chapter 6). Just drink water and tea; you’ll feel much better.
Search for the increasingly popular food trucks, in whatever neighborhood 
you find yourself in. These are little mobile food emporiums on wheels. A site 
called Roaming Hunger (www.roaminghunger.com) has food-truck maps for 
many major cities in the U.S.
Do a little homework on the Internet before you leave, and store the book-
marks for all the good food markets and restaurants around the places 
where you will be staying. 
In the airport itself, just subsist on fruit, tea, and water, if you’re not fasting. 
Food stalls in airports do sell fruit, albeit at a premium price.

The Internet is chock full of sites, some of them very good, for finding and 
storing food for lean times, as demonstrated by the search results at www.
google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=tips+for+finding+food+in+hard+

Many of these sites have an apocalyptic tilt, which is so commonly embraced 
these days that, for the sake of originality, I won’t make any references to 
societal collapse.
I do agree, however, with the old chestnut that we should hope for the 
best, prepare for the worst.

It’s becoming sadly more common to see the affliction of the richest coun-
tries in the world with regional food shortages. In the US, the state of affairs 
where one in four children are living in poverty and often going hungry 
is nothing short of shameful. At the same time, we’re also bedeviled by a 
“quantity not quality” food consumption pattern.
What are good strategies if you simply don’t have the resources to reliably 
acquire enough food? What are the good choices?
Barter with farms, or offer to work for food. When I was a student, and thus 
a waiter, dishwasher, and host in restaurants, I absorbed easily more than 
half my calories scarfing down the restaurant’s food (it wasn’t all that bad 
either—mostly meat, veggies, and salads). Go to your local farm and tell 
them you’ll work once a week for a big box of fresh food. 
Get the most bang for your buck. Buy healthy stuff in bulk that’s filling. 
Examples are bags of brown, Basmati, or other kinds of rice; a sack of local 
apples and potatoes; whole fowl like chicken or turkey, where you can make 
broth out of the stripped bird; as well as big blocks of quality cheddar cheese 
(read: it’s not a weird orange color and doesn’t have salt as a separate ingre-
dient). These foods are expensive but energy-dense and last a long time. 
Cram a big pot with stew materials and it will last several days. The super-
sized bags of crunchy snack foods are just a dead end; they might be cheap, 
but they’re not nutritious or filling.
Go crazy with coupons. Enough said; there’s so much already on the Web 
these days about coupon tips.
Eat only twice per day with apples or nuts for necessary snacks. It’s health-
ier to eat only within narrow windows; say, 7:00 AM to 7:30 PM only (see 
Chapter 6). Ultimately, eating twice per day most of the time will be cheaper 
than trying to pay for three big meals per day. Of course, this advice is only 
for adults. Children should eat as much as they need to grow, fuel their active 
days, and fill their bellies.
This is an obvious one: hunt and forage for food, beyond your own garden 
if necessary. A hunter who takes down a large game animal often has 
meat for the winter. Go fishing or gather blue mussels on the coastline 
(but check with the local health authority about any contamination or red 
tides first); see www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1980-11-01/
Mussels-How-To-Forge-Or-Farm-Them.aspx. Find edible plants (handfuls of 
fiddleheads only go so far, however). 
It’s hard work, but we’re evolved for this type of foraging behavior. That said, 
keep in mind the basic math of not expending energy in calories that exceeds 
the amount of calories you forage.

What If You Live in a Food Desert?
Food deserts are places where it’s hard to get to a grocery 
store or supermarket to buy any fresh fruits, vegetables, 
seafood, and other healthy edibles. The desert could be a 
city where the grocery stores or supermarkets have closed 
down in large swaths of neighborhoods, or the countryside, 
where food markets are few and far between and people 
may not have access to public transportation or a car. 
The Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. has a page on 
food deserts with links: www.cdc.gov/features/fooddeserts/. 
The USDA also makes available something called a Food En-
vironment Atlas, a map depicting food availability through-
out the U.S.: http://maps.ers.usda.gov/FoodAtlas/.
Chances are, however, if you live in a food desert, you al-
ready know it—no one has to produce a map to show that 
it’s hard to find good food. What to do about it?
What do people do when they’re stuck in a real desert? 
Survival experts know how to find water in the desert, 
from plants or rainwater that’s been captured by pockets 
or depressions in rock, for example (they also know how to 
determine if the water is safe to drink). You can also figure 
out to how find food in your desert: farm-food distribution 
programs such as farmer’s markets or food trucks may take 
place sporadically nearby; people may be growing food in 
community gardens; local churches and food banks may be 
distributing healthy foods (a new trend at best); and some 
of the “cheap eats” restaurants may have some healthy food 
on their menus (beyond the ribs, cheeseburgers, and fries).
When I was a student in New York City I often ate breakfast 
or dinner in a Spanish-style diner in my neighborhood. For 
a couple of bucks I could buy a complete dinner of chicken 
and rice, or eggs, bacon, and homefries, and the coffee was 
espresso served in small mugs. Of course, that was around 
1980.
Step outside the shell of your favorite ethnic foods and try 
the food of other cultures. For example, there might be an 
Asian food market nearby with some healthy veggies and 
fruit.
People also try to hike out of real deserts if they’re stuck 
there. So grab your backpack and bicycle, and ride to the 
food. You could come home with some meat, potatoes, 
and eggs, no sweat. I do this once in a while with my own 
backpack; I mountain bike to a farm and come home with 
some food. 
It’s worth it—you don’t want to live out of the convenience 
store attached to the gas station and be stuck with a meal 
of orange cheese, beef jerky, and potato chips.
Consider the swallow-your-pride school of urban foraging—freeganism. 
“Dumpster diving” now has a cult following, and is far more productive and 
potentially nutritious than another fad called “planking” (I never knew what 
those folks were doing stretched out on their suburban banisters). An entire 
library of “urban and suburban survival” books exists, as hinted at by the few 
Amazon.com titles shown in Figure 5-4.

Fasting is a scary thought to some people. Food is deemed important for 
all kinds of reasons other than raw hunger. What’s that line I keep seeing 
painted on restaurant walls and on websites: food is love? Fasting means no 
food, for hours on end (although at least half of the hours are spent asleep). 
In the 2002 remake of the movie Swept Away, Madonna’s character talks 
about the virtues of fasting, and that line is supposed to make you hate 
fasting, because she’s promoting it, and her character is a snarling, narcis-
sistic plutocrat. But fasting is virtuous, from a symbolic, religious, and ethical 
standpoint, and there’s even good scientific evidence that a modified form 
of this practice, called intermittent fasting, is quite healthy. 
People fast for lots of reasons: in solidarity with groups that are suffer-
ing persecution, for instance, such as the thousands of displaced peo-
ple in the Darfur region of Africa (see http://fastdarfur.org). As for reli-
gion, in Judaism, for example, the Yom Kippur fast lasts 25 hours. 
During the Muslim Ramadan tradition, the fast takes place from dawn 
to dusk each day.
Here comes that human-evolution angle again—we seem to be naturally 
evolved for fasting. Humans and mammals in general respond metabolically 
very well to it (see the sidebars covering the science behind fasting). This 
adaptation may have evolved from our ancestors’ activity patterns. They 
had to constantly physically seek food, and must have periodically 
dealt with extreme swings in food availability (see the discussion 
in the sidebar “An Interview with a Scientist on Fasting and 
Metabolism” and this 2004 Journal of Applied Physiology 
article: http://jap.physiology.org/content/96/1/3.full). 
It has become increasingly evident that we’re actually designed 
to periodically fast.

An Interview with a Scientist on Fasting and Metabolism
In October 2011, I interviewed 
Dr. Thomas Seyfried, a biology 
professor at Boston College 
whose research program has the 
goal “to manage complex 
diseases through principles of 
metabolic control theory.” His 
contact page is at www.bc.edu/
schools/cas/biology/facadmin/
seyfried.html. 
How did you first become interested in implementing research 
on intermittent fasting, caloric restriction with adequate nutri-
tion (CRAN), metabolism—in the context of genetics and the 
environment?
We have researched for many years the therapeutic benefits 
of calorie restriction and calorie-restricted ketogenic diets 
for managing several neurological diseases like epilepsy, 
autism, lipid storage diseases, and cancer. Inflammation 
underlies the progression of many diseases. Both calorie 
restriction and fasting target inflammation.
Are we humans designed for intermittent fasting—in other 
words, does it turn on pathways that promote health? Does it 
express genes in a positive way? Many have speculated that 
our evolutionary ancestors (such as from the Upper Paleolith-
ic) may have experienced extreme swings of food availability, 
thus intermittent fasting or the equivalent became built into 
our genes.
Humans evolved as a scavenger species. Scavengers gener-
ally experience a “feast-famine” existence. I agree that our 
physiology evolved to function during extreme swings of 
food availability. Humans are genetically programmed to 
survive for long periods (months) with little or no food. This 
information is elaborated further in Herbert Shelton’s book 
Fasting for Renewal of Life.1
A number of studies have shown consistently interesting 
and positive results from fasting and lab animals. Is it safe or 
sensible to extrapolate the results from the smaller mammals 
to humans?
We (and others) have shown that calorie restriction in 
rodents is not the same as calorie restriction in humans. The 
basal metabolic rate of rodents is about seven times that of 
humans. Consequently, the health benefits seen in rodents 
from a 40% calorie restriction are realized in humans from a 
seven-day water-only therapeutic fast. 
What are the types of metabolic changes that take place dur-
ing an intermittent fast (i.e., insulin levels go down, glucagon 
goes up)? Can we assume that there is a lot of variability in 
how humans and mammals respond to it?
The physiological changes associated with fasting are 
conserved across mammalian species. Insulin goes down 
because blood glucose goes down. Glucagon goes up 
in order to mobilize fats and to produce glucose (gluco-
neogenesis) from stored proteins. Fats are metabolized to 
ketone bodies, which replace glucose as a major fuel for the 
brain. Ketone body metabolism reduces inflammation and 
enhances metabolic efficiency of most cells.
Are there any interesting long-term metabolic adaptations 
that take place after many weeks or months of fasting?
Yes, energy efficiency increases. This means that the energy 
stored in the chemical bonds of consumed foods is maxi-
mally oxidized for ATP synthesis in all body cells. Energy ef-
ficiency increases up to a point, however. Prolonged fasting 
can lead to the pathological effects of starvation.
Is there a rule of thumb for when an intermittent fast becomes 
starvation (i.e., a number of hours), and therefore not healthy 
(it’s causing micronutrient deficiencies and too much harvest-
ing of muscle for energy)?
It is important to distinguish the differences between fast-
ing and starvation. Water-only fasting for a week or two is 
therapeutic, as the body enhances metabolic efficiency. 
Starvation is pathological and occurs after about 40 days 
of no food for most normal-weight people. Starvation 
damages the body in metabolizing needed muscle tissue 
for energy. Obese people, however, can survive without the 
pathological effects of starvation for many months. George 
Cahill and Oliver Owen show this in their many studies of 
obese patients.

Intermittent Fasting 
An Interview with a Scientist on Fasting and Metabolism (continued)
Can I ask if you fast? (I’m an intermittent faster, about 15 hours 
a few times per week.)
I usually fast for 24 hours at least once a week and up to 18 
hours several times a week, but I have not engaged in pro-
longed fasting for several days or a week. I would definitely 
conduct a more prolonged fast if I were diagnosed with dia-
betes or cancer. Our extensive research shows how fasting 
deprives the glucose needed to drive cancer cell growth. 
Fasting will also enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce the 
symptoms of diabetes. It is not necessary to use toxic drugs 
to manage these diseases.
I would be remiss if I didn’t ask: do you have a favorite fitness 
gadget (a pedometer; HR monitor, etc.), and if so, which one?
No, I do not use fitness gadgets. However, we do use blood 
glucose–ketone meters to monitor our blood glucose and 
ketone body levels following short fasts. Blood glucose 
levels in the 55–65 mg/dl range and ketone levels in the 
2–3 mmol range are indicative of high metabolic efficiency 
and health.
Intermittent Fasting 
Intermittent fasting is a hot topic, particularly among weightlifters and resis-
tance trainers.
An intermittent fast is a short-term fast (usually lasting a part of a day) that 
you include in your lifestyle throughout the week. It’s a part of the whole 
matrix viewed as your fitness routine, taking place alongside the various 
modes of exercise and rest periods that are dispersed throughout a training 
regimen. 
Intermittent fasts are good for your metabolic health, increasing the burn-
ing of fats for energy, improving insulin sensitivity, lowering inflammation, 
and increasing growth hormone levels (while fasting). Its proponents even 
advocate undertaking an occasional training session while fasted.
Intermittent fasts represent a shift of traditional thinking among athletes 
and coaches. For decades, athletes have experimented with various over-
feeding strategies for fueling exercise (such as carbo loading, uncommonly 
high protein intakes, and even heroic images of Rocky Balboa guzzling 
down a dozen eggs).
From the “don’t try this at home” file: as Chapter 4 (on micronutrients) 
points out, excess consumption of raw egg whites can cause a severe 
vitamin B7 (biotin) deficiency, because of avidin, a protein in egg 
whites that binds with biotin and prevents its absorption.
There are no hard and fast rules on how to implement an intermittent fast, 
and later in this chapter we provide a few tips on getting started.

Intermittent Fasting 
Chapter 6
142
What Happens in Your Body During Fasting
Your metabolism undergoes a number of positive changes 
during an intermittent fast, including the increased burning 
of your fat stores for energy:
1.	 Insulin levels go down. Insulin is the messenger 
hormone that the pancreatic beta cells secrete in 
response to a rise in blood glucose. Insulin acts as the 
key, permitting the entry of glucose and amino acids 
into cells. If the muscle cells or fat cells, for instance, 
sense too much insulin in the blood all the time, they 
become resistant to it (because too much glucose or 
sugar is toxic to the cell). Fasting and exercise help the 
body retain its sensitivity to your own insulin. Insulin 
also inhibits lipolysis and promotes fat storage, rather 
than the metabolizing of fats for energy.
2.	 Glucagon levels go up during fasting. The pancreas 
secretes both glucagon (when glucose levels are low) 
and insulin (when blood glucose is high). A hormone, 
glucagon carries the message to release fats, or free 
fatty acids (FFAs), into the bloodstream so that the 
body’s cells can start utilizing FFAs for energy, since the 
blood glucose levels have dropped. The fancy term for 
the burning of fats is lipolysis.
3.	 Glucagon also tells the liver to break up or “depolymer-
ize” its stored starch (called glycogen) so the body can 
use the stored glucose for energy. The liver-glycogen 
stores are easily replenished after fasting, by eating 
carbs, because the liver only stores about 70 grams or 
280 calories’ worth of glucose. The muscles store up to 
another 200 or 300 grams or 800–1,200 calories’ worth 
of glycogen (which is actually long polymers made of 
glucose molecules bonded together). Some estimates 
put the body’s total storage of glycogen at up to 2,000 
calories; see the sidebar “Where Did You Get All That 
Energy?” in Chapter 10. The latter amount varies based 
on how big and muscular a person is, and other fac-
tors. On the other hand, prompting your body to burn 
fats more efficiently is a great thing; we store about 
100,000 calories’ or more worth of fat.
To roughly determine how many stored calo-
ries you have in the form of adipose tissue or 
stored fat, figure out your body composition 
first. Say you’re a male, weigh 165 pounds, 
and have 15 percent body fat. Your body has 
about 165 x 0.15 x 16 ounces of stored fat: 
396 ounces or 24.75 pounds. There are about 
28 grams in an ounce and about 9 calories 
per gram of fat, so the total stored calories 
would be 396 x 28 x 9, which equals 99,792 
calories. Compare this to only about 1,200 
calories of stored glycogen, give or take, and 
roughly 12 pounds’ worth of muscle protein 
that you could harvest for energy. At any one 
time, our bodies are using all three sources 
of tissue for food, but there’s a limit on how 
much protein harvesting you can do. If your 
body uses about one third or more of your 
muscle mass, (i.e., muscle wasting), you will 
die. Still, the body has a remarkable ability 
to generate energy from stored tissue, which 
perhaps tells us something about how we 
evolved.
4.	 About 10 to 15 percent of energy during fasting 
derives from catabolizing or using protein as an energy 
source, the fancy term for that being gluconeogenesis. 
The body has a mechanism for catabolizing protein 
into amino acids and, via a certain chemical pathway, 
making glucose or sugar from the amino acids. It’s nor-
mal to use some of your muscle protein, for example, 
for energy, and the body has internal feedback systems 
to protect your hard-earned muscle from being exces-
sively harvested. It’s just that we’ve evolved to have a 
variety of internal methods to generate cell fuel when 
we’re not gobbling up carbs all the time (a food source 
that’s only been in virtually limitless supply for about 
the last 50 years or so). After about a week of fasting 
(as an intermittent faster, you’d never fast for a week 
anyway), the body cuts way back on gluconeogenesis. 
Let’s say your body generates 12 percent of 
the energy it needs during a fast by convert-
ing amino acids to glucose (gluconeogen-
esis). This is a reasonable speculation, but 
we know that the vast majority of inter-
mittent-fast energy will be provided by free 
fatty acids and stored glycogen. You might 
expend 1,000 to 1,500 calories during a typi-
cal intermittent fast. This equates to perhaps 
120 to 180 calories or 30–45 grams of pro-
tein, which is not significant. A whey protein 
shake plus other protein sources during the 
post-intermittent-fast meal will take care of 
that, and then some.

Variations: 19/5 and “Eat Stop Eat”
What Happens in Your Body During Fasting (continued)
5.	 Human growth hormone (GH) levels go up during fast-
ing, as they do during exercise and during deep sleep. 
GH also has a lipolytic effect; it binds to fat cells and 
imparts the instruction to “release fats for burning and 
don’t store as much fat.” GH has an important anabolic 
effect on building muscle and cartilage. GH stimu-
lates the liver and other tissues to secret a “minion” 
hormone, IGF-1, which in turn sends the protein or 
muscle-synthesis message.2
6.	 Ketone body levels go up. Ketone bodies, or ketones, 
are the biochemicals that result from the burning up 
or oxidation of fats (free fatty acids) for energy. As your 
use of FFAs goes up, your ketones go up. The body, 
particularly the brain, can use ketones as energy in the 
absence of glucose; rising ketone levels are the direct 
result of burning more fat for energy. Dr. Tom Sey-
fried has done interesting research on the inability of 
many cancerous tumors to use ketones for energy, for 
example (see the previous sidebar, “An Interview with a 
Scientist on Fasting and Metabolism”).
This is just a selection of changes the fasting body under-
goes, and I derived some of them from a 1982 physiological 
analysis of a religious fellow who underwent a long-term 
fast.3
For the most part, during intermittent fasting, you only fast during one 
chunk of the day (such as when you’re sleeping plus a few hours), and you 
can even start out initiating an intermittent fast during just one or two days 
of the week. 
Variations: 19/5 and “Eat Stop Eat”
Some people respond well to sticking with a specific intermittent fasting 
protocol that is part of a bigger fitness routine, usually with an experienced 
trainer/athlete behind it and with the help of books or a website. Some 
examples of these are:
1.	 The “Fast Five,” or 19/5, a setup that involves fasting for 19 hours every 
day, then eating whenever hungry for 5 hours: www.fast-5.com. 
2.	 Leangains (www.leangains.com), a 16/8 setup with additional protocols 
for training and eating.
3.	 Alternate day fasts (ADFs) that involve fasting for a full 24 hours and eat-
ing an unrestricted (within reason…) amount of calories the following 
day. One variation of ADF is “Eat Stop Eat,” which was invented by Brad 
Polin, a sports trainer who wrote a book of the same name.
Interestingly, the fasting benefits tend to accrue with ADF even if the 
total amount of calories consumed is no different than what people 
used to eat before they went the ADF route (e.g., no fasting, three 
meals a day). See the sidebar “What the Studies Say About Fasting.”
Most fitness geeks have plenty of leeway for determining the type of fasting 
that works best for them.

The Basics of Intermittent Fasting:  Getting Started

What the Studies Say About Fasting
A number of studies have focused on the positive effects of 
intermittent fasting and caloric restriction (CR), sometimes 
referred to as caloric restriction with adequate nutrition 
(CRAN). The latter practice involves substantially restrict-
ing the usual calories taken in by about 15 to 40 percent 
in order to take advantage of the longevity and health 
benefits that a number of lab tests have indicated (at least 
with animals like rats, mice, and monkeys). CR is one of the 
few proven longevity extenders. But most people cannot 
stomach (pun intended) CRAN, because it begins to look 
and feel like chronic starvation, and you certainly could not 
make any athletic gains like new muscle on it. The good 
news is that studies have found similar metabolic benefits 
with intermittent fasting:
• A 2007 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
found that alternate day fasting (ADF)—that is, a day 
of feast and a day of fasting—lowered risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and 
helped some subjects lose weight. The review found 
more compelling animal evidence and speculated that 
human trials exploring these issues hadn’t lasted long 
enough (in some cases, only a few weeks). The authors 
speculated that three mechanisms may be at work with 
fasting: 1) the cells become more stress resistant; 2) the 
mitochondria in the cells produce fewer free radicals, 
the metabolic “storm” that creates oxidative stress and 
DNA damage; and 3) CR may induce a built-in program 
that slows down metabolism in the presence of scar-
city. “Indirect evidence suggests that the two regimens 
[including CRAN] may share mechanisms.”4
• A 2005 study in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 
found that intermittent fasting also increased lifespan 
in lab animals, even when caloric intake had not been 
reduced overall. Various diseases (in animals) such as 
cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease were delayed or 
prevented by CR and intermittent fasting. The sug-
gested mechanisms (in humans as well) were decreased 
insulin resistance (lower glucose and insulin concentra-
tions in the blood), reduced oxidative stress, increased 
cellular stress resistance, as well as enhanced immune 
function. Intermittent fasting imposes a mild stress on 
brain cells, which respond by “enhancing their ability 
to resist more severe stress.” The “cellular and molecular 
effects of IF [intermittent fasting] and CR on the car-
diovascular system and the brain are similar to those 
of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mecha-
nisms.”5
• A January 2011 article in the Journal of Applied 
Physiology found that cycling in the fasted state four 
times per week was more efficient than cycling with 
high-carb fueling. The study examined 20 young men, 
half of whom received about 1,000 calories of carbs 
before and during the 60- to 90-minute cycling bout, 
while the other half fasted during the session. Fasting 
had a number of effects that did not take place with the 
carb-fueled athletes: greater amounts of intramuscle 
fats were utilized for fuel, exercise intensity increased 
more in the fasted cyclists, metabolic enzyme activity 
was “upregulated” among the fasters, and fasted train-
ing “prevented the exercise induced drop in blood glu-
cose” (surprisingly enough…).6
The Basics of Intermittent Fasting:  
Getting Started
You probably want to give intermittent fasting a try. At the very least, it 
provides a default choice in the face of any confusion about whether what 
you are eating is counterproductive or not: “When in doubt, don’t eat.” Here’s 
how to get started:
1.	 Map out a day where you can go at least about 14 hours without solid 
food (water, tea, and black coffee are okay). This usually involves the 
period after you’ve finished dinner and then throughout the night. But 
you can use whatever setup is easiest to implement, given your life 
schedule. The actual time blocks depend on your personal work and 
sleep routine, of course.

Food Timing: When to Eat, When to Fast 
145
The Basics of Intermittent Fasting: Getting Started 
2.	 The fast cannot usually involve any calories (unless you’re doing a partial 
fast); this would disrupt the fasting metabolism (in which your blood-
sugar or glucose levels are maintained without the input of food—see 
the sidebar “What Happens in Your Body During Fasting”). Tea or coffee 
without cream or sugar is generally okay, but a purist might insist on no 
caffeine, which exerts a powerful effect on the central nervous system 
(thus, you could argue, changing the hormonal milieu for the fast). Most 
of us have to work or have responsibilities during most fasts, so a little 
coffee or green tea during the intermittent fast is a reasonable compro-
mise and poses no harm.
3.	 Upon awakening, in the usual fasted evening scenario, you skip break-
fast and, if so inclined, start the day only with a cup of joe or tea. As we 
mentioned, a lump of sugar and big splash of cream in the coffee will 
tend to send the food signal to the body, in part by raising insulin levels, 
so that’s generally considered a “cheat,” or you might consider this a 
partial or moderate fast. 
The USDA Nutrient Database does indicate that tea and even black 
coffee are not 100 percent calorie-free (two calories per eight ounces, 
in fact). An intermittent fasting purist may insist on only water or reli-
ably calorie-free drinks during the fast, but we might be splitting hairs 
a bit too finely here. You’ll still be getting some of the metabolic ben-
efits of fasting by restricting calories a lot.
4.	 The science also supports a fasted workout. Therefore, the next step 
would be to hit the gym hungry for your favorite high-intensity weight 
regimen. To many beginner and veteran athletes, this might seem coun-
terintuitive, even scary, but it actually feels good and the athlete tends 
to adapt to lifting weights on just sleep, water, and coffee (in my case). 
What is the science? For one, a 2010 study in the Journal of Physiology 
took three groups of young men and fed them a high-fat, high-calorie 
diet for more than a month. They divided them into three groups: one 
group fasted and trained (four times a week cycling); another group 
trained on carbohydrate fuels, like a high-carb breakfast followed by 
energy drinks during exercise; and the third (control) group did nothing. 
The control group gained about seven pounds in six weeks, predict-
ably. The carb-fed group gained about three pounds, but the athletes 
training in the fasted state didn’t gain any weight, even when they were 
pigging out around the training and fasting. Among the fasters, several 
biomarkers improved at a higher rate than in the carb group, including 
insulin sensitivity and the muscle adaptations for quickly turning over 
the increased fatty acids in the diet.7 For more intermittent fasting–relat-
ed study results, see the sidebar “What the Studies Say About Fasting.”

5.	 You can also do endurance training in the fasted state (this was actually 
the training protocol for two of the fasting studies we cite in this chap-
ter). This appears on the face of it, and from my experience as a former 
endurance athlete when I usually stuffed food like gels or bananas in 
my pocket, to be much harder to do when fasting than short-term high-
intensity weight training. After 80 minutes of, say, hard riding, you could 
bonk, and there are good physiological reasons for that, such as because 
all the glycogen—your internal storage depot of starch in the muscles 
and liver—has been depleted by the fasting and exercise itself. It does 
depend on the intensity level of the exercise, and how well you have 
previously adapted to fasting. You could also save this kind of training 
for the nonfasting days, unless you’re very adapted to it. 
6.	 Or, you don’t have to train; you’ll still enjoy some of the benefits of inter-
mittent fasting.
Interview with the “Warrior Diet” Author
Ori Hofmekler is an author, a 
former member of the Israeli 
Army, an acclaimed artist, and a 
well-known nutrition and 
muscle-building researcher. His 
most recent book (2011) is 
Unlock Your Muscle Gene: Trigger 
the Biological Mechanisms That 
Transform Your Body and Extend 
Your Life (for more information, 
see www.warriordiet.com or www.defensenutrition.com). He 
answered a few questions for us on the research he has 
done on fasting and metabolism.
What was your inspiration for creating the warrior diet and 
writing the book?
What drove me to write the Warrior Diet book is a combi-
nation of factors—my personal experience, the historical 
evidence, and the science that provides evidence for its 
nutritional strategies. 
I’ve been enjoying the benefits of this diet regimen for 
many years. Nonetheless, what inspired me the most 
was the realization that the same dietary principles were 
followed by some of the healthiest and most culturally 
advanced early warrior societies, including the Greeks, 
Spartans, Macedonians, and Romans. 
In addition, growing scientific evidence points to the 
outstanding benefits of this diet for human health and lon-
gevity. Based on evolutionary biology, we now know that 
the human body evolved to thrive on specific foods and a 
certain feeding cycle. The premise of the warrior diet is to 
revive these primal dietary features and provide guidance 
on how to apply them in your diet.
What is the rationale for the 20/4 structure of fasting-eating? 
Are we humans evolved for this “famine/feast” cycle?
Accumulating evidence indicates that we are evolved for in-
termittent fasting, based on a feeding cycle of one meal per 
day. And the proof is in our bodies. If you take a close look 
at how the human autonomic nervous system operates, 
you’ll realize that it’s inherently designed to accommodate 
this feeding cycle—hence, fasting (or undereating) during 
the day, and feeding at night. Let me explain. 

Food Timing: When to Eat, When to Fast 
147
The Basics of Intermittent Fasting: Getting Started 
Interview with the “Warrior Diet” Author (continued)
The autonomic nervous system is divided into two parts: 
the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which regulates 
your activities during the day, and the parasympathetic 
nervous system (PSNS), which regulates your activities 
during the night. These two parts of the autonomic nervous 
system have opposite effects on your body. During the 
day, the SNS promotes alertness, fat burning, and action, 
whereas during the night, the PSNS promotes relaxation, 
energy conservation, and sleepiness. 
Note that the SNS is promoted by lack of food and inhibited 
by large meals. The PSNS, on the other hand, is promoted 
by large meals and inhibited by lack of food.
This means that the human body is not programmed for 
large meals during the day. Large meals inhibit your SNS. 
And every time you eat a large meal during the day, your 
body shifts into a nightly mode—conserving energy rather 
than spending energy, and getting fatigued rather than 
keeping alert. This is why you feel sleepy and sluggish after 
a big lunch. 
Meal timing is a crucial factor that cannot be overlooked. 
All the evidence shows that biologically we evolved for 
nocturnal feeding. We digest and utilize nutrients better 
at night, when relaxed, under the domination of the PSNS.  
Daytime meals such as the typical breakfast and lunch are 
counterproductive, as they suppress cognitive functions, 
inhibit fat burning, and disrupt normal metabolic functions. 
Daytime overfeeding seems to be a major contributing fac-
tor behind the current epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and 
related diseases. But there is more to it… 
A frequent intake of large meals during the day suppresses 
critical metabolic pathways responsible for detox, repair, 
and rejuvenation. The human body evolved to benefit from 
fasting in a similar way that it evolved to benefit from ex-
ercising. Periodic fasting puts the body in a survival mode, 
which is crucial for maintaining prime health. Animal and 
human studies have shown that fasting resets the meta-
bolic system to improve insulin sensitivity, increase energy-
utilization efficiency, restore hormonal balance, destroy 
cancerous cells, repair tissues, counteract disease, and block 
the aging process. 
The lack of food triggers a cellular recycling mechanism, 
which digests and recycles broken proteins and damaged 
cells to be used as building blocks for cellular and tissue re-
pair. Technically, fasting activates growth factors that signal 
stem cells to commit and regenerate new cells in the brain, 
muscle, bone, and connective tissues. 
It has been suggested that early human adaptation to this 
famine-feast cycle was an evolutionary advantage that 
improved our species’ gene pool through natural selection 
(survival of the fittest), and kept us alive and thriving on this 
planet. 
The purpose behind the warrior diet’s 20/4 structure of fast-
ing/feeding is sheer simplicity. This structure helps illustrate 
and clarify the ratio between fasting (or undereating) and 
feeding.
You get a window of four hours for your main meal, which is 
about the optimal time needed to fully nourish your body. 
The other 20 hours include 6 hours required for complete 
digestion. This leaves you with about 12 hours of net fast-
ing, where your body shifts into a survival mode—hence, 
you enjoy 12 hours of detox, repair, and rejuvenation every 
day. And the accumulating effect of this rejuvenation 
process will be manifested in your state of health, physical 
shape, and biological age. 
The 20/4 structure is just a suggested model. In real life 
there is no need to calculate hours—the premise of this 
feeding cycle is simple: have one main meal per day at 
night. 

Eating in Blocks or Windows
Chapter 6
148
Eating in Blocks or Windows
When you’re taking part in regular intermittent fasts (essentially, every day), 
you have narrowed your window for eating. You might only eat in an 8-hour 
window during the day (fasting for 16 hours). There are good reasons why 
some of the prescriptive intermittent fasting regimes are based on this 
narrowing of the eating window. You take advantage of all the benefits of 
fasting (e.g., better blood-sugar control, more fat burning, higher glucagon 
and growth hormone), and you can eat based on hunger level whenever you 
want during the window.
Chances are, this eating in a narrower window means you only eat two meals 
a day, but they can be big meals that include supplements (like a whey pro-
tein shake) if you’re actually trying to put on muscle. Other people will sim-
ply eat fewer calories without breakfast and lose extra pounds. After fasting 
and exercising, you should break the fast within about an hour and eat. Eat 
quality protein, like branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), now that you’ve 
started the muscle-building process by fasting and lifting weights. There 
is also evidence that fasting preferentially catabolizes (uses for energy) the 
BCAAs the body harvests from muscles,8 so it makes sense to restore them 
with quality whey protein (which contains BCAAs) or meat afterward.
The rest of your meal, which is likely to contain some carbohydrate (veggies, 
fruits, rice, potatoes, bread, etc.), will quickly replenish the liver glycogen, 
since the body preferentially refills that glucose-storage depot once it’s been 
depleted.
Don’t Be a Hungry Vampire
Eating in blocks and windows after a fast also prevents other kinds of bad 
habits, like the unnecessary night eating (because you ate during the day), 
or constant snack-eating, which we’re not designed for. Middle-of-the-night 
eating is notorious for generating unneeded body fat; if you stop eating at 
7:30 PM and initiate even a minimal fast of 12 hours each night (eating again 
at 7:30 AM), watch for the probable difference it will make in cutting unnec-
essary fat and in how you feel.

Don’t Be a Hungry Vampire
Fasting might not be a good idea if you’re taking medication and/or strug-
gling with a chronic medical issue, so make sure to consult a physician in these 
circumstances before you try intermittent fasting. Because of the difficulty 
of making wise choices while being saturated with unhealthy pop-culture 
images of celebrities whose bodies have been augmented by Photoshop, 
fasting may also not be a good idea for young men and women who might 
seek weight loss as a goal, as opposed to metabolic improvements. 
One Athlete’s Experience with Fasting
I asked Bob Watson, a teacher, athlete, and cross-country 
coach, to provide some details on his own experience with 
intermittent fasting. He mainly combines intermittent fasting 
with resistance training and, when he’s coaching, running.
I’ve been doing the Martin Berkhan/Leangains-style 
16-hour daily fast for a while now. I toyed with 24-hour 
fasts once or twice/week a couple times this summer, but 
honestly it feels too long—not that I get overly hungry, 
but when I break the fast the food would sit heavily in my 
stomach and the joy of eating was diminished. Also, I think 
the 16-hour daily regimen works well for me because of my 
personality (I like routines) and my regular work schedule. 
Others might find longer fasts once or twice a week easier 
to do. Most days it’s no problem to make the 16 hours, but 
if I’m famished and haven’t hit 16 hours yet, I eat. When 
I travel I play around with different fasting protocols so I 
don’t have to eat airport food.
I usually don’t get too hungry, and when I do, it’s very 
manageable. I used to get hungry and get headaches, my 
stomach would growl, etc. Now, if I’m hungry, I can eat 
right away or I can wait an hour or more with little to no 
discomfort. There is one aspect of the fasting that I keep a 
mental eye on, and I think this is very much linked to my 
detail-oriented/concrete thinking personality: I worry a bit 
that I obsess about timing my meals and feel pressured to 
always be on top of fasting/eating times. I would like to 
start adopting a looser stance like you talk about—doing 
it a few times a week. I will keep playing around until I find 
something natural, but for now the 16-hour fasts fit nicely 
into my schedule.
My usual schedule is:
Wake up 6:30. In the morning, I drink 2 pints of water upon 
waking. Then I make a half mug of strong black coffee that I 
sip on the way to work and into my first period class. I drink 
another pint or more of water around 9–9:30.
I usually eat lunch between 11 and 12. This is usually a 
pretty big meal, as I’m ready to eat at this point. Leftover 
pot roast, 6-egg omelets, things like that. If it’s a workout 
day, I’ll add a starch—usually a large sweet potato. I also 
have a shake with lunch on workout days. I make a “fat 
bomb” smoothie à la Richard Nikkoley from freetheanimal.
com: coconut milk, water, frozen berries, protein powder, 
cocoa powder (100%), and one or two raw egg yolks (from 
my chickens in the backyard). I usually drink half of this at 
lunch and the other half after dinner as dessert. Water with 
all meals and throughout the day—I try to keep my intake 
up. I probably drink about 4 or 5 pints during the day.

Apps for Fasters
You can use any digital timer to show you how long you’ve fasted (or you 
could just look at your watch). For example, you can use the Endomondo 
app with an unspecified fitness category of “other,” as shown in Figure 6-1 
(we talked about this app for measuring sports fitness training in Chapter 2).

The Fitbit gives you a pretty good picture of how many calories you’ve 
burned during the fast (we also discuss this device—a pedometer with a 
website—in Chapter 2). I’m not too sure how useful that is, as “calories in, cal-
ories out” is probably a crude measure of what’s happening physiologically 
during a fast (and your weight will be affected by how well you’re hydrating 
during the fast, among other things). 
At any rate, while I’m not privy to the algorithm the Fitbit software uses, the 
calorie calculation probably goes something like this: your basal metabolic 
rate (say, 70 calories per hour for me) x number of hours of fast + extra calo-
ries expended by activity (say 300 calories, during a 4.5-mile walk on the 
beach).
Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents how many calories you 
expend to maintain internal physical systems in the absence of addi-
tional activity—say, if you laid on the couch all day. 
So, given the latter equation and a 16-hour fast, the fast would have expend-
ed or “cost” about (16 x 70 + 300), or roughly 1,420 calories. This gives you 
an idea of how much you should be eating during the chow-down window, 
to replenish your body and even add lean mass (in that case, you probably 
should eat more than the fast expended).

We geeks just don’t get outside enough. After a while, “outside” begins to 
be defined as the carpeted hallway outside the main office where the rest-
rooms are, or the food court emporium downstairs. 
I once worked in a software house in a beautiful, historic seacoast commu-
nity. People worked hard there and seemed to like the company and their 
jobs. The trouble was, no one went outside. People were so fond of their 
cushy positions, it was as if they were afraid to leave the environs after 9 AM 
rolled around. Even at lunch break, most of them would stay in their cubicles 
or repair to the cafeteria for the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. 
What do you expect from a company that still held “casual Friday,” during 
which management wore jeans (they probably called them “dungarees”)?
Of course, it wasn’t exactly the company’s fault that no one was going out-
side (even though they were a little chintzy about vacation time). Everyone 
had simply forgotten their roots, or had been dissuaded by antisun dogma.
Outside the company were beautiful hilly walks that you could take in the 
sun. I took them every lunch break, and they made me forget about the 
somewhat dun-looking brick offices. A whole new world existed out there, 
including a coffee shop I’d hit up for a to-goer on the way back. The shop was 
partly managed by a former Sherpa for Mt. Everest expeditions, believe it or 
not (he was now working at about 50 feet above sea level). He would chat 
with me about climbing Everest, I would look at his maps, and from there I 
would dream. I never would have discovered his shop if I never went outside.
The Sun Is Our Friend
To keep a theme going from Chapter 1, we have built-in software code 
that expects us to be companionable with the sun. We were not designed 
to sit in a dark room all day and night, typing code. This has become the 
norm in some software outfits, but once you discover the negative fitness 
implications of being a shut-in, you might look askance at this sunless office 
existence.

The Sun Is Our Friend
Chapter 7
154
Simply being in the sun, or at least outside, first thing in the morning, then 
at least sporadically throughout the day for an indoor worker and for a long 
time during the weekend, is healthy.
The problem is, we’ve been inculcated with advice and dogma that the 
sun is our enemy. It causes skin cancer; therefore, we should always cover 
ourselves with clothes and sunblock. A very good doctor in every other way 
once told me to apply sunblock whenever I was out in the sun for more than 
10 minutes, even in New England during the winter. 
The sun is healthy for a number of reasons: 
• It helps you make vitamin D (a lot of it, if you’re a young lifeguard in a 
bathing suit or a youngster running around in the sun—sun burns are 
bad though, so watch the dosage).
• Vitamin D and/or increased sun exposure may actually prevent many 
cancers, possibly beyond the vitamin-D effect. According to Dr. john 
Briffa, “Higher levels of this nutrient and/or increased sunlight exposure 
are associated with a reduced risk of several cancers.”1
• Sun exposure first thing in the morning stimulates a part of the hypo-
thalamus in the brain called the supra-chiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to send 
signals to the rest of the body, helping control body temperature and 
the release of hormones such as cortisol and melatonin (which has a 
delayed release, until evening). These actions control your internal clock 
(when you feel wakeful and sleepy—see Chapter 9).2 
• Sunlight has a mood-elevating effect for most people. 
• Heck, we might find out, down the line, that a little sun exposure posi-
tively effects gene expression.
And it goes on and on.
Our ancestors spent a lot of time outdoors in and out of the sun, and it’s 
even surmised that as we migrated to northern latitudes from Africa, the 
evolution to lighter skin was designed to admit more sunlight and vitamin D.

The Sun Is Our Friend
Go Outside for Friluftsliv: Ask the Scandinavians
Why should I go outside, 
when I have work to do? 
Well, ask the Norwegians 
and Swedish people, 
with their centuries-
old friluftsliv (roughly 
pronounced, “free-loofs-
leave”) tradition. As a 
writer who has just come 
upon this concept, I real-
ize that I have strongly 
embraced this tradition 
(without conceiving of 
it concretely as “tradition”), even though I never knew that 
a cultural philosophy had been framed around it. The term 
translates loosely as “free air life” or “free open air.”
It is a philosophy of basically making a spiritual connection 
with nature by walking and skiing in the wilderness a lot 
(please hold the sarcasm about communing with nature; 
there really is something to this philosophy fitness-wise). 
“Nature” could just be the local park or coastline—what-
ever you have available. You don’t have to jump on a plane 
bound for an expensive holiday in the Alps or Himalaya to 
enjoy it. The idea is to take long walks (or ski trips) whenev-
er you have the free time, with people you enjoy or just on 
your own, and that this activity is intrinsically beneficial for 
your body and soul, and makes you spiritually stronger by 
helping you appreciate your environment and understand 
your ecological niche.
Since way before the iPad, friluftsliv has been thought of 
as an escape valve for modern industrial lifestyles that jam 
us inside all the time and somewhat warp our views of our 
place on the earth. There is a philosophical connection 
between friluftsliv and the concept of “Deep Ecology,” an 
invention of the Norwegian mountaineer and philosopher 
Arne Naess (see www.deepecology.org/movement.htm). 
Both the Swedish and Norwegians have cultivated their 
outdoor traditions by implementing laws allowing the free 
use of uncultivated land and wilderness for hiking and ski-
ing, no matter who owns it. Too often, as one essay about 
friluftsliv points out, we have commercialized the wilder-
ness as an “arena” for testing ourselves and our gear.3
Not to mention the fact that long walks outside are healthy 
and a good remedy for stress. Friluftsliv, hmm, it’s hard to 
say, but count me in.
A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition examined the 
vitamin-D levels of two traditional cultures that live near the equator 
and spend a lot of time outside—the Maasai and Hadzabe hunter-
gatherers of Tanzania in East Africa. The mean vitamin-D level (25(OH)
D) in the blood of about 60 study participants, men and women, was 
115 nmol, or about 46 ng/ml, all obtained naturally by exposure to 
sunlight. The people typically avoided the sun at its strongest, during 
midday. “Populations with traditional lifestyles having lifelong, year-
round exposure to tropical sunlight might provide us with informa-
tion on optimal vitamin D status from an evolutionary perspective,” 
according to the study.4
So, now we’ve established that being outside is healthy (see the sidebar on 
the Scandinavian philosophy of friluftsliv). 

Exercising Outside
Chapter 7
156
Exercising Outside
Obviously, exercising outside is healthy, too—particularly the right kind of 
exercise. Simply being outside during parts of the day, such as first thing in 
the morning as the sun rises, enhances your overall outlook and fitness in 
its own right. Now we’re going to add some descriptions of outdoor fitness 
techniques and tools, beginning with good old walking.
Walking
Back when I was putting in mega miles as a runner and biker, I used to have a 
somewhat snotty attitude toward walking. I used to see lots of people taking 
their habitual morning walks, and snicker. My attitude could be summed up 
as “Hey, we’re bipedal by nature, so how can that be a ‘workout’? You gotta 
kick it up a notch to get really strong!” 
Little did I realize that I was the one who was wrong, or know that this was 
the whole point, and elegance, of walking in the first place. We’re perfectly 
designed for walking, we can go many miles without tiring or breaking 
down, and the motion itself has a variety of beneficial effects. It’s healthy, 
simply because walking isn’t sitting.
You don’t have to put in mega miles to reap the benefits of walking. As 
mentioned in Chapter 2 on tools, we seem to be designed for a steady oscil-
lation of movement throughout the day (not sitting all day). Thus, little walks 
spread throughout the day, particularly as mental breaks, have a perfect 
place in our fitness strategy while working. Not to mention the fact that they 
get us outside, under the sun (or maybe if you’re in Seattle, at least the view 
is good), and off the mechanistic treadmill.
It’s possible that walking helps burn fats, the chief source of fuel for 
striding, from peripheral fat depots of the body, where you want to 
reduce it. Jogging, on the other hand, may burn fat predominantly 
within the muscles’ fat storage sites, where you don’t mind having fat.
Walking raises the heart rate, but not to the extent where you kick your 
metabolism up to a level where you stop burning fats predominantly (we’ll 
discuss walking and weight loss when we cover our Endomondo fitness 
walk). The cardiovascular benefits particularly accrue when you’re carrying 
a little weight like a backpack and the walk itself is hilly (see “Hiking and 
Climbing” just ahead in this chapter). 
You can combine walking with many other fitness techniques, such as pull-
ups, push-ups, jumping, and sprints. We’ll discuss all of these combo fitness 
techniques throughout this chapter.

Recovery plan
Walking is the perfect recovery plan for resting from a sprint or especially a 
resistance-training or weight workout. You’re getting the rest that’s required 
following those types of training sessions (if you’re doing them correctly), 
yet ideally, you’re outside, getting some movement, as well as enjoying 
Mother Nature. 
Walking is also good preparation for any big efforts that you have planned 
(e.g., climbing your first 14,000-foot mountain, or doing your first triathlon), 
yet it doesn’t leave you overtrained, unrested, or with muscles that lack their 
stored glycogen. It is essentially a form of rest that still qualifies as exercise, 
if you catch my drift.
Sports nutrition–wise, the big muscles are likely to retain their glycogen 
stores, since during a slow walk you are mostly going to burn fats from fat 
storage sites (so don’t bring stuff to eat on a walk, or your body will leave the 
fats alone and burn the carbs you’re eating for energy!).
Family stroll
Walking is the “training” you can do with other companions, whether it be an 
80-year-old grandparent, a child, or a dog. What is that saying? “Want to lose 
weight—get a dog.” There are hundreds of benefits to walking. Like swim-
ming, you can even do it injured (unless the injury is to your legs).
Walking is great for people whose jobs require long or frequent cell 
phone calls. Just do it while walking; you’ve killed two birds with one 
stone, and converted a health-negative behavior (yakking on cell 
phones) to a net positive. As long as you keep the cell phone a safe 
distance from your head, that is! Do most phone calls while walking—
the calories will add up. 
Walking tools
Other than your walking stick, of course, a phone with the Endomondo app 
loaded onto it and a camera are perfect tools for tracking and capturing your 
walk. Go to www.endomondo.com if you haven’t acquired the free app yet.
Simply being outside during 
parts of the day, such as first 
thing in the morning as the sun 
rises, enhances your overall  
outlook and fitness in its own 
right.

The app will grab all the statistics and mapping data for your walk (and we’ll 
show you how to load that data into Google Earth later, in the “Hiking and 
Climbing” section). Figure 7-2 shows the statistics for the short walk I took 
to start off the morning. It wasn’t very long—1.45 miles and about 28 min-
utes—but notice that the calories or kcals burned were estimated at 130. 
I’ll include a bit more information on that in a moment. The buttons at the

You can scroll to another screen for a map of your walk, but you can view an 
even better one on the website itself. Figure 7-3 shows the map for my flat

The calorie count is, of course, an estimate, which probably includes your 
basal metabolic rate (BMR). See the sidebar on BMR for more information. 
For example, my BMR is roughly 70 calories per hour, meaning I’d burn off 
about 1,680 calories while prone in bed all day. So, during a 28-minute walk, 
I burned about 130 kcal according to Endomondo, or about 100 kcal extra 
on top of my BMR.

What’s Your Basal Metabolic Rate?
The BMR represents how many calories humans expend to 
maintain their vital organs and functions. This is the amount of 
fuel in calories that is required to run your brain (which repre-
sents about 20 percent of your energy), your heart, lungs, liver, 
kidneys, skeletal muscle, and on and on. It does not represent 
the calories you expend running or lifting weights, or even 
digesting food (food-related thermogenesis).
It is usually expressed as calories or kcal per day, as in 1,680 
kcal per day or 70 kcal per hour. The BMR is roughly the 
amount of calories you would burn in a day if all you were 
doing was lying on a couch.
An easy calculation to figure out your BMR per hour is 
kilograms (kg) of weight (1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds) times 1 
if you’re a man, or times 0.9 if you’re a woman. So a 70-kg, 
or 154-pound, man has a BMR of 70 kcal/hour, or 1,680/
day; and a 60-kg, or 132-pound, female has a BMR of 60 
kcal/hour or 1,440/day. There are other, more complicated, 
BMR formulas (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_meta-
bolic_rate#BMR_estimation_formulas), but they pretty much 
reach a similar conclusion.
The body-composition (BC) scales that many athletes and 
health-conscious people use, such as the Tanita BC scales, 
use a slightly different formula that attempts to take into 
account the different levels of lean body mass each person 
has. 
Lean body mass is the weight of your body, not including 
its fat tissue. Strip all the fat off your body, even the adipose 
tissue you need to survive, and that’s your lean body mass.
A pound of muscle burns more calories per day (about 6 to 
10) than a pound of fat (about 2), so more muscular people 
have above average, but not that much higher, basal meta-
bolic rates. For example, if you gain five pounds of muscle 
(which is hard to do, depending on where you are starting 
from), your BMR goes up by about 30–50 kcal per day (a 
couple of big bites of a corn muffin). Despite former claims 
that adding muscle will cause your BMR to soar to the tune 
of 50+ calories per pound per day, this is not true. Muscle 
building has many other substantial health benefits, how-
ever, including better strength, balance, injury prevention, 
positive gene expression, and insulin sensitivity.
Little things add up
If you’re trying to drop a few extra pounds (and who isn’t these days, among 
us geeks?), and you take two of these pleasant, easy walks per day (no 
big deal), you will expend an extra 7 x 200, or 1,400 kcal for one week (if 
you don’t quaff a pint of India Pale Ale during the walk, or chow down a 
corn muffin). This would add up to 8,400 calories in six weeks, or about 2.4 
pounds (8,400 / 3,500).
There are about 3,500 calories in a pound.
As mentioned previously, the section on hiking shows how to load captured 
Global Positioning System (GPS) data into Google Earth to view an even 
cooler and more memorable panorama of your route (except we’ll show 
something more exciting, as in a wilderness mountain hike).

Sprinting
We are all natural-born sprinters. How many times did you sprint as a child—
after a friend, a dog, a baseball, a Frisbee, a dream, a phantom? Forgot, didn’t 
you? It had to have been thousands of times. Study after study has shown 
how effective and efficient sprinting is for fitness. We won’t bore you with all 
the technical details behind sprinting, except to mention a few eye-opening 
studies, then we’ll move straight to some cool sprinting techniques and 
protocols. 
One of the most impressive aspects of sprinting, or interval training, is that 
studies show it tends to slow the aging process in terms of the cardiovascu-
lar system and the specific leg muscles involved with sprinting, such as the 
Type II “fast twitch” fibers in your quadriceps or thigh muscles. Your skeletal 
muscles include Type I slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are less powerful 
but take longer to fatigue, and the faster-fatiguing “fast-twitch” fibers—Type 
IIa (slightly longer to fatigue) and Type IIx.
Interval training means short, often all-out sprints followed by short 
rests, and then additional sprint repetitions. Intervals are a common 
training technique in a number of sports, including cycling, Nordic ski-
ing, swimming, and even weightlifting.
One 2006 study did a detailed analysis via muscle biopsies of the legs of 
sprinters of varying ages. They studied men aged 18 years all the way up to 
84. The results were surprising; the 84-year-olds (yeah, people that age and 
older are still sprinting!) had fiber-power values that greatly exceeded those 
of untrained 70-year-old men. Even more impressive was that the octoge-
narians had the equivalent sprint power of untrained 40-year-old men, less 
than half their age.5 So get granddad out there!
The study also emphasized the fitness gains and antiaging aspects of explo-
sive-type exercise techniques: “Although our findings are not directly appli-
cable to untrained people, they tend to favor the view that, to minimize the 
effect of aging on the neuromuscular system, optimal overall physical train-
ing might require actions that impose explosive-type overload on muscle.”6 
Sprint efficiencies
Sprinting produces high fitness levels in a more time-efficient manner com-
pared with long endurance workouts. Study after study indicates this ben-
efit, including the original research behind the now-famous Tabata Protocol 
(see the “Tabata sprints” section).
A 2006 study in the Journal of Physiology studied the fitness difference 
between athletes who had undergone short-term interval training and oth-
ers who did long-distance cycling. They split up 16 men to perform six train-
ing sessions over 14 days. The “sprinters” did four to six all-out 30-second 
One of the most impressive 
aspects of sprinting or interval 
training is that studies show it

system and the specific leg  
muscles involved with sprinting.

sprints on a bike with 4 minutes rest between them. The long-distance cyclists 
did 90-minute to 2-hour cycles each workout, at a moderate pace. 
The study scientifically analyzed the athletes after the study period to mea-
sure their progress in improving cardiovascular strength. Even though the 
total difference in cycling time was 2.5 hours for the sprinters (over six work-
outs) versus 10.5 hours for the longer-distance cyclists, the training benefits 
were about the same. 
“Given the large difference in training volume, these data demonstrate that 
SIT [sprint-interval training] is a time-efficient strategy to induce rapid adap-
tations in skeletal muscle and exercise performance that are comparable to 
endurance training in young active men.”7 
The long and the short of it
“So what?” you might reply. “I like riding my bike for long distances—I don’t 
want to go home after getting my butt kicked for 28 minutes.” So be it—I 
often have the same attitude. Long-distance endurance training, what some 
have dubbed “chronic cardio,” does have it downsides, however, in terms of 
eating up lean body mass (a.k.a. your muscles) and generating more wear-
and-tear injuries to the feet, knees, and hips, as well as a greater production 
of oxidative stress—the “reactive oxygen species” that you’re eating all those 
antioxidants in your meals to deal with.
On the other hand, one of the upsides of “long slow distance” is its relaxing, 
contemplative quality—its positive influence on reducing stress. Sprinting, 
by contrast, sometimes feels like another form of stress.
It is “good stress”, though—see Chapter 11 and its segment on  
hormesis.
As a practical matter, not everyone can jump right into sprinting, particularly 
someone who has weight issues or is bouncing back from injury or illness 
and has just begun an exercise program. 
This past weekend, I took advantage of a mild winter in New England to put 
in about 30 miles on my mountain bike, under the sun. It felt wonderful (I did 
throw in some cycling sprints in high gear on the first day), and provided a 
welcome relief to higher-intensity skiing in some of the subArctic tempera-
tures we had experienced of late. 
The consensus advice is, at least once a week, substitute a sprint workout for 
one or more of those long hauls, and you’ll be fitter and better off.
Sprint protocols
Sprinting offers all kinds of combinations or ways of structuring the work-
out. Thankfully, everyone knows how to do it (just run, and imagine you’re 
being chased by a grizzly bear!). It all depends how fit you are when you start

sprinting. I’m an advocate of going to a track or a soccer field where the dis-
tances are known and/or marked off. A beach is also a great place to sprint, 
because it offers the extra resistance of sand and the opportunity to do the 
runs barefoot, along with the sublime seascape itself.
We’re talking about running sprints here, but the same protocols can 
be applied to intervals in other sports.
Sprinting a soccer field
A regulation soccer field is about 100 yards from goal line to goal line (some 
are 110). Here’s a routine I use sometimes. 
I have a soccer field about two miles from my house (given the popularity 
of the sport, just about everyone does these days). As a warm-up, I pull on a 
pair of sneakers, hop on a mountain bike, and ride around effortlessly for 10 
or 20 minutes, ending at the field. A warm-up is necessary—it doesn’t have 
to be too extensive—because you’re going to be using your “highest gear” 
for sprinting, and you don’t want to tear anything.
I get to the soccer field, park the bike, and do a little more stretching and 
warm-up as I jog over to the goal line. Since it’s grass, I often do these sprints 
barefoot. In the beginning of the season, when I’m not up to sprint shape, I 
dash no more than 50 yards, to the center of the field. Even a few 25-yarders 
to get in the proper state of mind and to prime the big leg muscles for an 
all-out effort will do the trick. 
Maximum effort, not steady state
Another common technique for sprint warm-ups on a field or basketball 
court is “shuttle runs.” Sprint 5 yards, turn around and jog back; sprint 10 
yards, turn around and jog back, sprint 15 yards, and so on.
I sprint to the 50-yard line four or five times, with each sprint a little stronger 
than the one before. Depending on how you feel, you can just walk back to 
the goal line after each dash. The idea is not to keep the heart rate high all 
the time, but to produce a maximum effort that lasts just a few seconds.
The mental game
All forms of exercise are “mental” in nature, and involve a lot of emotional 
engagement and visualization. Sprinting is no different. I imagine I’m flee-
ing from a predator, or trying to save a loved one (yikes, that train is coming 
and they need to be dragged off the tracks in time!). When you hit the final 
10 yards, you really open up; imagine an Olympic sprinter who starts in a 
crouch, but by the final yards she’s in a straight-up stance, taking short pow-
erful strides and pumping her arms.
Sprinting offers all kinds of 
combinations or ways of 
structuring the workout.

The Other World: A.K.A. Outside

Time to go all out
Sprinting involves a lot of upper body engagement to propel the body forward.
If a few 50-yard sprints feel good, it’s time for an all-out 100. Do one com-
plete soccer-field sprint all out, leaving nothing left. Time yourself, and use 
that metric for future runs. As you get stronger, all your sprints will be 75 to 
100 yards, barring a few warm-ups. 
I try to keep 15 seconds or less as a benchmark, for example.
How do you know you’ve gone all out for 100 yards? This is kind of a person-
al, almost primordial feeling, a mixture of fatigue and fear. Most of the time, 
you simply can’t go any faster. Once you get used to sprinting 100 yards, 
the final 25 yards will feel liberating, but you can’t wait to hit the finish line. 
Your body should feel like it is undergoing an intensive, good stress. Once 
there, you commonly can’t talk at all as you catch your breath. Your heart rate 
probably hit its maximum level, roughly 220 minus your age, then went back 
down, rapidly if you’re in good condition. Sometimes after the final rep of an 
interval you feel ever so slightly nauseous. This passes very quickly. I don’t 
advocate sprinting until you barf!
To get yourself psyched, watch Usain Bolt of Jamaica run a sub-
20-second 200 meters: www.squidoo.com/Usain-Bolt-The-Track-And-
Field-Athlete-Biography. 
You can walk back slowly to the goal line, with runner’s high and all, calmly 
savoring the maximum effort. You’re the healthier for it.
Specific sprinting protocols
There are all kinds of protocols you can use for structuring your sprints, 
including ones of your own invention (see the “Make it up” section).
We just mentioned a study that used four to six repetitions of 30-second all-
out sprints, with four minutes of rest between them. This is a good protocol 
for the beginning of your sprint program. The rest period seems like a long 
time, but that’s the point. Being rested for each repetition allows you to 
reach the proper level of intensity for each interval.
As we’ll get into in our discussion of resistance training in the next chapter, 
the purpose of the sprint is to stimulate or stress the big, fast-fatiguing Type 
IIa or IIx muscle fibers. These muscles are not trained by slow to moderate 
jogging; that kind of locomotion will be taken care of by the less powerful, 
slower-to-fatigue Type I fibers of the leg. 
Type II fibers include a few subclassifications—IIa and IIx.
If you don’t blast through your fast-twitch muscles, you won’t stimulate the 
adaptations and metabolic changes that you want.

Another protocol involves 10 one-minute intervals at 60 percent of your maxi-
mum capacity, with a minute rest between each one. This routine came from 
Clarence Bass’s website (www.cbass.com); he’s a totally ripped septuagenar-
ian who has written many books on bodybuilding and health, and knows of 
what he speaks. 
The latter routine could be used as a moderate introduction to hard sprints 
like the Tabata Protocol.
Tabata sprints
The now-famous (among interval and CrossFit geeks) Tabata protocol is a 
remarkably simple (but hard!) method for increasing your cardiovascular 
strength and health. It is becoming very popular in several sports, as it’s 
become quite common for runners, cyclists, Nordic skiers, and CrossFit afi-
cionados to adopt this technique.
The Tabata Protocol is named after one of its inventors, a professor and 
researcher in Japan named Izumi Tabata. His studies determined that this 
interval protocol allows you to have your cake and eat it too: the routine 
strengthens both aerobic fitness and sprint strength. It derived from work 
he originally did with speed skaters.
The intervals involve eight repetitions of 20-second all-out efforts, with 10-second 
rests. In other words, a total of four minutes, not including warm-up and cool 
down. The key is the shortness of rest, which is minimal while you’re doing 
these sprints, if you do them correctly (meaning, you don’t exceed the rest 
interval). Izumi himself, in an interview, pointed out that this four-minute 
maxed-out routine is “more than enough to make even a fit person exhaust-
ed . . painful.” In fact, for this reason, he doubted that Tabata would ever be 
popular beyond hard-core competitive athletes.8
The protocol has nevertheless become wildly popular, even among resis-
tance trainers, probably because of its proven effectiveness, its short-term 
duration, and the challenge it presents. I think people simply love running 
as fast as they can, as if this behavior triggers a kind of Paleo pathway with 
which we are instinctively familiar. 
For example, I introduced Tabata sprints to a cross-country team about a 
year ago. We jogged over to a dirt path in the woods. Knowing that a typical 
soccer field length would be good for Tabata sprints, I jogged along, roughly 
measuring that distance (counting a yard for every one of my strides), then 
marked the end with a stick I pulled out of the woods. This was a decidedly 
low-tech introduction to Tabata sprints, taking place in a woodsy, less sani-
tized environment than a track.
Then we broke up into two separate groups, one the slightly speedier and 
more fit and the other slightly less so. I did the sprints with them, then 
looked at my watch to count off the 10-second rest. They turned out to love

the workout, and it became their favorite training session throughout the 
week. The cross-country coach, a friend of mine, noted that the team made 
rapid strides in overall strength and fitness once they started using Tabata. It 
was noticeable after just two sessions. 
One of the runners told me later that she kept doing them throughout the 
summer once a week on her driveway.
Could it be that one of the reasons this routine is popular is the catchy 
name itself, with its funky internal rhythms that seem to suggest “keep 
to the beat”?
Make it up
You don’t have to jump right into Tabata sprints. You can just make up your 
own routine, and it will make a difference. It’s the all-out effort that matters. 
Here’s what I did the other weekend. I didn’t have the flexibility to go to a 
track or the beach alone, as I was looking after my son at home.
I used Endomondo to measure a 100-to 120-yard length along the flat drive-
way that runs in front of my house. This is easy to do: just set Endomondo for 
a Fitness walk, and begin walking until you reach .07 mile (roughly 123 yards; 
the app will increment the miles by hundredths of a mile). 100 yards is about 
.056 of a mile, so you can pace out .06 of a mile and place a marker a bit shy 
of that milestone. Now you have a 100- and a 120-yard course to sprint on.
You can also set the Endomondo app for a kilometer unit of measure 
in its settings segment. 
I did six 120-yard sprints with a leisurely walk back to the starting line in 
between, accounting for a rest between reps of about 1:15. I was doing each 
rep in about 19 to 21 seconds, not quite all out, but maybe 80 to 90 percent. 
Then I did the final 100 all out, a little faster than I did the previous sprints. 
That was just what I felt like doing that morning, no more no less. In the old 
running days we used to say, “Do one less interval than you think you can 
do” (don’t run to failure). In other words, when you finish an interval and your 
body is telling you that you have just one left, that’s the time to go home.
I cannot point to a scientific study that underlies the latter strategy, but it’s 
folk wisdom that works well.
Run/Cycle/Sprint Hybrids
Sprints can easily be incorporated into steady-state training sessions. This 
is typical of cycling when you head off at your usual “spin” or cross-country 

Body-Weight Exercises

pace, then initiate sporadic all-out sprints along the way. Fartleks and body 
speeds are two ways of incorporating sprints into long runs.
Fartleks
Fartlek means “speed play” or “speed game” in Swedish. It is nothing more 
than fast runs or sprints between landmarks during a long run. The tech-
nique has been around since the running boom started in earnest decades 
ago, and was designed to add a speed workout to mileage.
The way I always did fartleks was to sprint between telephone poles. City or 
suburban runners can sprint a block sporadically; or you can use whatever 
milestone you want, such as running hard up every hill. You can also mix up 
the number of repetitions and the intensity of each. If you run a fartlek really 
hard, you may have to walk the next tenth of a mile or so. 
Fartleks matter even on a short run, like two to three miles. Instead of just 
plodding along on a rather inefficient jog workout, you’ve done your routine 
run plus sprints.
Body speeds
Body speeds are a kind of technique drill for runners. They are good prepara-
tion for doing sprints if you’re just getting back to running all out (because 
we do let that inborn skill go stale!). 
You head out on a flat run or a track, and then for 50 or 100 yards or so run 
at about 75 percent of your maximum rate or sprint speed. While you’re run-
ning, you visualize being graceful, balanced, and smooth in your stride. You 
try to improve awkward aspects of your running, like rocking back and forth 
and not using your arms enough.
In other words, you’re not going fast enough to be thinking exclusively 
about how hard the effort is and only getting to the finish line. Your pace is 
slower, so you have the luxury of focusing on body and spirit as you glide 
along—it’s “mindful sprinting.” 
The idea is that by practicing your fast-running technique, you will become 
a smoother runner, and the more graceful sprinting will become second 
nature during your all-out intervals. Body speeds are also fun to do because 
you are going fast (and fast is fun), but they don’t hurt as much as all-out 
sprints. They seem to work.
Body-Weight Exercises
These are exercises that are designed to make you strong by pulling or push-
ing your own weight around. They can be performed inside or outdoors, but 
for most people it’s more fun to do them outside. That way you can get some 
sun and fresh air while you’re huffing and puffing, and you can combine 
these exercises with runs, hikes, and bikes.

Figure 7-4. Doing pushups outside with pushup bars
Push-ups
Most people know what a push-up is (as well as a pull-up), ever since Coach 
McConnell barked at them in gym class, “Down and do 10!” Figure 7-4 shows 
what a pushup looks like. 
Figure 7-4 shows a person using push-up bars, which provide some 
variation when doing the exercise. For some people, the pushups are a 
little easier and the position more comfortable with the bars. For oth-
ers, they are harder. The conventional push-up involves palms flat on 
the ground.
Push-up training, particularly in the beginning, shares some features with 
sprinting. If you can’t yet do a lot of push-ups at once (e.g., 30–50 without 
resting), work up to them in sets, with a decent rest between sets. 
Push-ups are a great warm-up exercise, as well as a strengthener for your 
arms, shoulders, chest, and back. 
You can improve your push-up and overall strength by actually making 
them harder by adding more weight. I do push-ups with my young son lying 
on my back, which is kind of a nice way to get a workout in while you are 
horsing around with kids. You can also do push-ups with a weighted vest (a 
vest you put on that suddenly makes you 40 pounds heavier!). For the sake 
of “empathy training,” all men should be required to walk around in these 
vests before their wives ever enter into a pregnancy.
All kidding aside, the vests are adjustable by four-pound increments.
The idea is that when you’ve done push-ups with a greater amount of 
weight resisting you, your muscles (and everything else that is involved with 
pushing your weight, such as the neural mechanics) will adapt to the harder 
weight and the “normal” push-ups will be easier. 
Push-up training, particularly in 
the beginning, shares some  
features with sprinting. If you 
can’t yet do a lot of push-ups  
at once (e.g., 30-50 without  
resting), work up to them in 
sets, with a decent rest between 
sets.

Inverted Push-ups
Other ways to “resist” a typical push-up is by doing inverted ones, with your 
feet on a bench, step, chair, or couch. Or, even harder, place your feet on the 
small inflatable exercise balls they have in gyms and do inverted push-ups 
that way. 
Combine push-ups with sprints/weights. After each sprint interval, drop down 
and do 10 push-ups. This is a CrossFit-type routine. Or include push-ups with 
weightlifting. I often finish my final set of bench presses by turning around 
and doing inverted push-ups on the same bench. Bench presses are covered 
in Chapter 8.
Pull-Ups/Chin-Ups
Most people can do at least one push-up with no practice, but pull-ups? This 
is a tough one. It’s a challenge worth meeting, though, because once you 
reach the point where you can perform several pull-ups, you know you have 
reached an impressive level of conditioning, strength, and health. 
Pull-ups are a challenging but fruitful exercise. This exercise strengthens the 
arms, chest, back, and even abdominal muscles. Chin-ups are very similar, 
but involve the grip with your palms facing you, or facing each other (as in 
the grips on certain pull-up bars in gyms).
Outdoors offers the ideal setting for doing pull-ups. I start off most mornings 
at home with some sun (if it’s out) and a set of pull-ups on a small jungle gym 
in my yard. You can obviously do them on any conceivable bar or beam from 
which you can hang, including a tree branch. 
Figure 7-5 shows a setup for outdoor chin-ups. The grip involves the palms 
facing toward me.

How to do a pull-up
Warm up first by doing something with your arms and shoulders that is 
easier than a pull-up (which includes just about anything) such as a dip or 
pushup. Grip the bar above you and hang by the bar, palms facing away 
from you about shoulder-width apart. Cross one foot behind the other and 
try to keep your back straight, your body aligned and balanced. Pull yourself 
up so that your chin meets or exceeds the bar height. Then go all the way 
back down and do it again. Yeah, right!
You can experiment with different grip variations, wider or narrower 
on the bar.
Try to do as many as you can. Imagine not only your chest and arms provid-
ing the propulsion, but also bring in your upper back and abdomen with a 
recruitment of many muscle groups. The same concepts hold true for chin-
ups, but this time the grip involves the palms facing in. 
You can get stronger for pull-ups by implementing any exercise that 
strengthens the upper body, such as push-ups, bench presses, or military 
presses (see Chapter 8). Another way to increase the number of pull-ups you 
can do is to offer resistance in some manner, as in increasing the weight you 
are lifting, beyond your body weight. Use a weighted vest or belt and try to 
do as many pull-ups or chin-ups as you can.
Another recommendation comes from Stew Smith, a former Navy Seal, 
whose website includes a lot of valuable fitness information.9 He suggests 
using the pyramid method: do one pull-up, rest, two pull-ups, rest, etc. until 
you can’t do anymore. Then work your way back down (say you were able to 
do five): 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1.
Trick or program yourself for more push-ups and pull-ups
Let’s say you have a bad habit you want to break, or you simply want to draw 
attention to it. You can’t keep your hand out of a bag of cookies or potato 
chips, or a refrigerator full of beer. You have a weakness for watching vapid 
TV broadcasts when you could be reading or getting more outdoor exercise. 
Every time you eat a cookie, you have to do 5 pull-ups, a kind of penance. Or 
10 pull-ups; make it progressively more difficult. Every minute of imbecilic 
TV or web surfing is translated into another pull-up. Or better yet, simply 
turn off the TV and other screen devices unless you have something pur-
poseful to do with them (like finish a book!).

Planks
Pull-ups strengthen your entire upper body, and so do planks. You’ve heard 
people mention the importance of strengthening your core (i.e., lower and 
upper back, abdomen, hip extensors, etc.). The plank is a good exercise for 
this. 
The plank position is similar to a push-up position, but you are balanced on 
your forearms and toes. Keep your body aligned in a level position; don’t let 
your back sag down. Use your abdominal muscles to keep your back and 
hips in a straightforward position. Try to hold the position for a minute, and 
do several repetitions.
Figure 7-6 shows what a plank looks like.
Figure 7-6. A plank outdoors in the sun
Obviously, you can do planks both inside and outside the gym. Another vari-
ation is to do inverted planks, similar to an inverted push-up, in which your 
feet are up off the ground on a bench or chair. I don’t fancy this position, 
however, because it seems to turn into an upper-body workout. Another 
plank variation is the kickback; when you’re in the plank position, pick up 
one of your feet about five inches and hold that position for a few seconds, 
as Figure 7-7 depicts.

Running Jumps
Jumping falls into the sprint category as an exercise we are designed for, but 
that quickly goes stale as we age. It’s an explosive movement that will keep 
the powerful Type II, fast-fatiguing, fast-twitch muscles of the leg in tune. I 
like to do various jumping drills outside. Walking along a trail in the woods, 
I’ll find a fallen tree and do sets of five standing jumps as high as I can onto 
the fallen trunk.
You can combine a short sprint with leaping. Go out to the beach and do 
a running jump as far as you can into the sand, similar to an Olympic long 
jump. We’re often too static and programmed with our exercise routines. 
We go to the gym or “facility” and train robotically or let an instructor put 
us through our paces; we lose the creativity and playful nature of exercise. 
Just make something up that requires different kinds of leaps under the sun. 
I have a stone wall that I jump on top of after a 30-yard or so run. It’s almost 
40 inches high, and I’ve found that the upper-leg weightlifting has helped 
augment my jumping ability.
Hiking and Climbing
Hiking is a perfect combination of cardiovascular and weight-bearing exer-
cise, if you’re carrying something on your back. Most hikes don’t peg your 
heart rate at an incessantly high level (which isn’t recommended for fre-
quent exercise bouts, because it wears you out and depresses your immune 
system, among other things). 
The exceptions are the occasional hard climbs such as Mt. Washington’s 
Tuckerman Ravine in New Hampshire, Mt. Whitney in California, Mt. Rainier 
Hiking is a perfect combination 
of cardiovascular and  
weight-bearing exercise, if 
you’re carrying something on

in Washington, or countless other climbs in the Rockies, Alps, Andes, 
Scottish Highlands, or other places. It’s not like you’re going to do these 
climbs every weekend, unless you’re a mountain guide. Particularly concern-
ing the Whitney Mountaineer’s Route or Rainier, you will be baked afterward, 
and sore. Better to rest for a couple of weeks after these kinds of efforts.
Escape valve from the “thousand little stresses”
Hiking is generally a low-level effort ideal for strengthening the upper legs, 
recovering from harder efforts such as sprints or weights, as well as enjoying 
Mother Nature. It provides a break from “screen life” and the thousand little 
stresses of our modern lives.
I’ve moved to using trekking poles for hiking in recent years, and I find that 
they help me establish a rhythm, as well as taking the pressure off my knees 
and lower back during any steep descents. 
Figure 7-8 shows me following my guide Braden Downey on Mt. Whitney’s 
Mountaineer’s Route in 2010. Quite a spiritual journey!
Figure 7-8. Hiking is a great form of outdoor exercise and adventure
Hiking as training is great for you, whether you are planning an upcoming 
climb or not. Pack a heavy backpack, anywhere from 20 to 40 pounds, and 
hit your favorite trail, or even some stadium steps. If the pack isn’t heavy 
enough, put rocks or other heavy items inside it. When I’m training for a hard 
hike or climb and I can’t get to Vermont’s Green Mountains at the moment, 
I’ll hike wearing a 40-pound vest. 
Lugging around a weighted vest is not as fun as hiking a mountain, 
but it’s better than nothing.

Tools for hiking and trekking
There are numerous GPS-related tools and apps that augment a great hike 
(along with a good camera!). You can use Endomondo to track your hike and 
measure all kinds of aspects, such as your pace at different segments of the 
climb and the various elevation grades. 
You can use Backpacker GPS Trails, another app for cell phones, to map out 
a hike with waypoints, as well as load preexisting treks into the software to 
guide your own trip. 
Endomondo mashed up with Google Earth
We discussed Endomondo’s mashup with Google Earth briefly in Chapter 
2, but here I’m going to go into a little more depth on each application’s 
features. These are great combinations of software tools, tailor-made for 
trekking geeks.
Figure 7-9 shows a late-autumn wilderness hike I took in Vermont’s Green 
Mountains. This was actually the descent part of a hike into the woods from 
the top of a small mountain. The figure shows the screen Endomondo will 
display in your browser after you click the Workouts menu choice, then 
choose one of your climbs in the calendar view.
Figure 7-9. The Endomondo graph shows speed and elevation
As Figure 7-9 shows, you can trace the line on the graph at the bottom of 
the page with your cursor, and it will show the accumulated time at that 
point, the speed at which you were moving, and the elevation. The little blue 
circles are mile markers along your route.

The right-hand column shows all the juicy statistics for the hike. Click the 
Export button to store a GPX XML file, specifically a .gpx file, on your com-
puter’s hard drive. 
GPX stands for GPS Exchange Format. It is a “light-weight XML data 
format for the interchange of GPS data (waypoints, routes, and tracks) 
between applications and Web services on the Internet” (www.topo-
grafix.com/gpx.asp). See the “Inside the GPS Exchange Format File” 
sidebar for more GPX files).
The free Google Earth application can then import this .gpx file. 
It’s a text (actually, XML) file with a name such as no name.gpx.xml. Open up 
this file in your favorite, XML-capable text editor and save it as myhike.gpx, 
or something like that, to make it friendlier for Google Earth (I use the BBEdit 
text editor on the Mac for this task). 
The GPX file contains a bunch of track segments and track points in XML 
markup, which looks like the following code:
<trk> 
    <src>http://www.endomondo.com/</src> 
    <link href="http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/kEWNFeprngg">

This is the way the GPS device records a route: as a sequence of latitude 
and longitude points associated with a point in time, as well as an elevation 
figure.

Inside the GPS Exchange Format File
The GPS Exchange format is “a light-weight XML data 
format for the interchange of GPS data (waypoints, routes, 
and tracks) between applications and Web services on the 
Internet.”10 You usually see a GPX file as a text file that is in 
the form of XML. If you don’t know what XML is, it’s just a 
structured method for describing the data contained by 
the text file with a markup language (similar to HTML and 
especially XHTML, which provide most of the underlying 
code for web pages). 
Chances are, if you download a file from your GPS device, it 
will be in GPX format (with a suffix or extension that looks 
like .gpx). The file can be uploaded to other devices that 
want to read the route it contains. Garmin Connect, (con-
nect.garmin.com) Endomondo (www.endomondo.com), and 
Backpacker GPS Trails Pro (www.backpacker.com) all allow 
the downloading of your recorded routes as a GPX file. 
Viewing the file in a text editor, it’s pretty obvious that it 
contains the information on a route or path over the earth. 
Here’s an example from a GPX file from recorded ski runs 
on the Endomondo app: a “track” contains “track segments,” 
which contain “track points”:
<trk> 
    <src>http://www.endomondo.com/</src>

      </trkpt> 
      ... 
   </trkseg> 
</trk>
A track point (<trkpt>) is just what you would expect it to 
be: a point of latitude and longitude or geographical point 
on a map, a timestamp (the second when you happened to 
be cruising over that point), and your elevation at that time 
(feet above sea level). In XML parlance, the trkpt element 
has a lat and a lon attribute that represent its latitude 
and longitude. It contains nested ele and time elements, 
representing the elevation and captured time. 
Put thousands of these points together in a GPX file, and 
you can draw a fine-grained line on a topographical map, 
which is what most applications do with them. You can also 
use your favorite computer language, such as Java or PHP, 
to read the XML off the file and do something else with it, 
such as save every track point you have ever recorded and 
display them on a map of the world. 
For more details on GPX, see www.topografix.com/gpx.asp. 
Launch Google Earth (there’s a free version), then open up your myhike.gpx 
file from within Google Earth, using the File➝Open command. 
If you’ve resaved the file Endomondo exported in your text editor (with a 
.gpx extension), Google Earth shouldn’t have any problem recognizing it.

Figure 7-11. The nifty elevation profile graphic in Google Earth
This is a fun mashup with a practical purpose. Suppose you have forestry- or 
land-management responsibilities and you need to map out routes through 
complicated terrain, or you simply want a record of a route through the 
wilderness. This combination of applications will give you most of what you 
need. The elevation profile in Google Earth will indicate the elevation grade 
(e.g., 21.8%), the elevation measurement, and the miles per hour at which 
you were moving, at any point in the hike. Cool!
GPS is notoriously inaccurate, in terms of different devices giving dif-
ferent mile measurements (they sometimes differ by tenths of a mile). 
This drives runners crazy, for example. You should never really use 
GPS to measure off an important race route or provide a profile for a 
newly discovered peak. The elevation grades and miles per hour are 
estimates. For the vast majority of our purposes, though, the GPS data 
is good enough.
So, between the Endomondo app on your smartphone, its export feature, 
and Google Earth, your ability to capture all kinds of hikes, bikes, runs, treks, 
or whatever with advanced visualization tools is unparalleled. You don’t 
have to be climbing Mt. Everest either to use this stuff; it will embroider even 
one of those short urban walks you took during a break from work.

Backpacker GPS Trails
Another nifty software tool that you can use for hiking is the Backpacker GPS 
Trails app. Unlike Endomondo, this app is specifically designed to record a 
shareable, GPS-enabled trip with recorded waypoints. A waypoint is a mile-
stone on a route; it can be annotated with icons and a text description. You 
can mark a waypoint on a route at any important spot, such as where a trail 
veers in another direction.
The Backpacker app also provides other ways of annotating a map, such as 
text comments and images. It even has an associated mapping application, 
for generating printed Topo maps (for a price, however). Figure 7-12 shows 
the screen on my Android phone.
Backpacker GPS Trails Pro (there’s a Lite version too) has an associated web-
site at www.backpacker.com, with a map and statistical data similar to that 
provided by Endomondo (the latter is more thorough at capturing the exer-
cise aspects of the hike, and keeping a running count of all the data).

GPS Trails Pro is also designed to plug in preexisting hikes and waypoints, 
thus allowing the hiker to use his phone as a GPS navigator. 
Figure 7-13 shows the page at www.backpacker.com after you’ve stopped 
recording your trek and (automatically) uploaded the waypoints to the Web. 
This was a little four-mile walk on the beach at Plum Island, Massachusetts.
A waypoint is marked as a set of geographical coordinates for a loca-
tion, such as 42.781893, –70.804734.
Figure 7-13. An island walk with waypoints
The little flags in the figure represent the waypoints that I set during the 
walk. You can annotate the waypoints to provide more information on the 
hike. The software allows fairly extensive editing of the map and waypoints 
online. Like Endomondo, it allows the download of a GPX file (with the 
extension .gpx) that you can plug into another GPS tracker, as well as a KML 
file that will open up directly in Google Earth. 
A KML file is just another kind of XML file that Google Earth knows 
how to read, with an XML namespace of http://earth.google.com/
kml/2.1.
Like Endomondo, Backpacker 
GPS Trails allows the download 
of a GPX file (with the extension

Another feature I like, although it’s commercial, gives you the option of 
generating a printed topographical map from the hike you recorded, as 
depicted in Figure 7-14.

This relatively inexpensive app seems promising as an easy way to use your

Outdoor Cross-Training Routines
The woods, beaches, and even deserts provide unlimited opportunities for 
outdoor exercise of a structured (e.g., parcourse) and unstructured nature.
A parcourse or “fitness trail” is an outdoor trail that has various sta-
tions set up along the way to do stretching, balancing, and strength 
exercises. I’ve encountered a number of cool parcourses in Switzerland.

The Other World: A.K.A. Outside

Outdoor Cross-Training Routines
Using the theme of just “making things up” as you go along, I’ve trained with 
a cross-country team by using what one might call “wild runs” through the 
woods. This was our own version of MovNat (see the accompanying side-
bar). We’d start off with scrambling and pull-ups on a sturdy, low-lying tree 
branch. This tests all-body strength, flexibility, and, for lack of a better term, 
tree-climbing ability. There’s nothing like climbing trees for maintaining 
strength-oriented fitness, and it falls into that “what we’re born for” category. 
Why have country kids over the ages been so good at climbing trees? How 
come they don’t have to be taught or coached first?
We’re Becoming “Zoo Humans”: MovNat to the Rescue
You may have noticed a recurring theme or paradigm in 
this book that goes something like this: we modern geeks, 
programmers, and office inhabitants are designed for a 
completely different set of behaviors and environment than 
those we find ourselves, here in 2012, confined to. 
This is one of the simplest explanations for why we feel so 
lowly so often. If you took a lynx out of the Vermont woods 
and put it in a cage, well . . .This realization among many 
has launched what I would call an antimodernist move-
ment, both recreational and philosophical, similar to the 
Sixties, but not necessarily laden with politics. You might 
also call it a “back to our nature” movement. Friluftsliv, dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter, also falls under this paradigm.
An athlete, sports trainer, and outdoors philosopher named 
Irwin LeCorre puts it very succinctly in his description of the 
popular “Movement Naturelle” or MovNat workshops that 
he has designed and taught throughout the world. Take 
note of this, from http://movnat.com/about/the-zoo/: 
The “zoo” is a modern, global, and growing phe-
nomenon generated by the powerful combination 
of social conventions, technological environment, 
and commercial pressures. Increasingly disconnect-
ed from the natural world and their true nature, 
zoo humans are suffering physically, mentally, and 
spiritually. Are you experiencing chronic pains, are 
you overweight, do you often feel depressed or do 
you suffer from frequent illnesses and general lack 
of vitality?
These symptoms indicate that you are experiencing 
the zoo human syndrome. Modern society condi-
tions us to think that this is normal and unavoidable. 
We don’t think so. Our true nature is to be strong, 
healthy, happy, and free. We have designed a com-
plete program that empowers zoo humans to experi-
ence their true nature.
He describes MovNat as involving: “the combined training 
of walking, running, jumping, balancing, moving on all 
fours, climbing, lifting, carrying, throwing, catching, swim-
ming and defending.”
Here are some more tidbits from MovNat’s web descrip-
tions of its approach to fitness (http://movnat.com/about/
the-pillars/):
• “In nature, any animal unable to move is condemned. 
As civilization leads us to increasing physical apathy, it 
is crucial to underline that constant physical idleness 
leads inevitably to loss of physical function and innu-
merable health problems.”
• “MovNat is primarily based on rediscovering and opti-
mizing instinctual movement patterns. It is in the first 
place about re-wiring the entire system of the human 
body back to its original mode and function.”
The MovNat group offers a number of workshops and fit-
ness retreats: see http://movnat.com/train-with-us/.
“We evolved from apes” would be the clichéd, somewhat cheeky 
response. The point is, we are designed to move naturally over the 
landscape that surrounds us. It’s just that we go stale sitting inside and 
in our vehicles all day.

Outdoor Cross-Training Routines

Then we would head off for a trail run, always interspersed with fartleks and 
pick-ups (dynamically picking up the pace then slowing down). We would 
stop, go off into the woods, and do balance drills on fallen trees, but extem-
poraneously. This kind of training is vastly superior to conventional static 
cross-country training (e.g., do jumping jacks then run till you drop, then do 
it again). 
The runners would always look forward to these wooded romps because 
they were fun. By the way, they were very strenuous, too.
Beach Fit Workout
If you’re lucky enough to live near or visit an open-ocean coastal area, you’ll 
find out that the seascape provides all the gym you need. Just take off along 
the sand: running, sprinting, walking (Endomondo tracking is optional). A 
beach is usually covered with driftwood of varying sizes and weights. This 
derives from storms that rip trees and manmade structures off the coastline 
and carry them out to sea.
Unfortunately, the beaches are also covered with an astonishing 
amount of trash. Ocean pollution is a huge problem in the world. Take 
part in as many beach clean-ups as you possibly can, organized and 
on your own. Consider bringing trash bags when you take a walk on 
the beach.
Use a log or piece of driftwood for jumping drills. Find a piece of wood 
shaped like a spear and hurl it like a javelin (watching for any beachcombers, 
of course). My occasional “beach fit” mornings are usually quite remote and 
during the winter; few other people are around, except maybe my son. Find 
a heavy piece of wood (those salt-laden and waterlogged pieces of debris 
can get pretty heavy). Starting in a crouch, pick up the log and push it end 
over end several times. See Figures 7-15, 7-16, and 7-17.

Figure 7-16. Hoist that bale! Flip that log!
Figure 7-17. Complete the drill—rest—do it again
Heavy carrying is great exercise, because it uses so many of the big muscle 
groups, upper and lower body. Instead of just walking a mile on the beach, 
walk a mile carrying a heavy piece of driftwood on your shoulder. Team car-
ries are popular, in which a group of people hoist a log onto their shoulders 
and carry it along the beach. This activity fosters camaraderie and teamwork. 
One slipup or lazy attitude, and the whole team suffers from the misstep. 
Another sequential teamwork drill on the beach involves taking turns carry-
ing a common load across the sand. The cross-country team I worked with, 
under an excellent coach and athlete, Bob Watson, lined up and took turns 
carrying a piece of driftwood as fast as they could a specified distance on 
the beach. 
If you’re lucky enough to live 
near or visit an open-ocean 
coastal area, you’ll find out that 
the seascape provides all the 
gym you need.

Outdoor Cross-Training Routines
Chapter 7
186
The person carrying the heavy item (like a chunk of driftwood) returns, 
passes it to the next person in line, then goes to the back of the line to await 
another turn. This represents another fun teamwork-oriented exercise that 
involves components of high-intensity resistance exercise and appropriate 
rests between each carry or rep, not to mention a lot of razzing from the 
temporarily idle teammates.
Again, the young teammates usually love it, for obvious reasons. It’s a “go 
with the flow” type of routine, with an element of playfulness. These types 
of workouts are by no means less effective than traditional, structured train-
ing (“Today we’re doing eight 200-meter dashes, six of which must be under 
30 seconds”). The playful workouts in pretty, outdoor settings are a good 
accompaniment to something more difficult to tolerate mentally, such as 
Tabata sprints.
Obviously, this chapter by no means covers every type of exercise you 
can do outside. We generally left out team sports, as well as specific 
sections on the various forms of long-distance running, cycling, and 
skiing (see Jack Fultz’s run-training methods at the end of this chap-
ter). Space limitations do not allow for this kind of coverage, but all 
of these specialized outdoor sports can use the techniques described 
herein to augment their own specific skill requirements and regimens.
Alpine Skiing/Snowboarding
Alpine, or downhill, skiing and snowboarding are fantastic forms of outdoor 
winter exercise. They are conducive to adoption by all ages; it’s common to 
see kids of 5 and sprightly codgers of 70 or older kicking up their heels on 
the slopes. My ski area has an “80-year-old club” with special parking spaces 
for them (and yes, the club has a few members). 
I’ve taken up downhill skiing more in earnest over the last five years, and it’s 
been a reminder that there is so much variety and nuance to this sport—
there’s even a form (called Alpine touring) that involves hiking up a moun-
tain carrying your skis, then hitching into the skis and shooshing down.
This is commonly called “backcountry” skiing or snowboarding, 
because a groomed resort is not required (but, especially in the Alps 
and the western US, avalanche training is required). Variations on 
free-heel skiing include Randonee, Alpine touring (AT skiing, as the 
lingo goes), and telemark skiing.

The Other World: A.K.A. Outside
187
Outdoor Cross-Training Routines
Alpine skiing and snowboarding have a number of special benefits:
• They foster leg strength, overall body balance, and improved proprio-
ception, or awareness of your body or physicality in space (and your 
ability to make fast, coordination-oriented adjustments).
• Downhill skiing is a great form of aerobic and anaerobic training; for 
beginner to expert-level skiing, a hard top-of-the-mountain to the bot-
tom run is like a long sprint.
• Skiing allows you to adapt to the cold temperatures; be outside during 
the winter (which drives many of us inside), often in the sun; and burn 
tons of extra calories as your metabolism ramps up to keep your body 
temperature stable (my pre-ski breakfasts always include one or two 
extra eggs, or I lose too much weight or lean mass). Cold-weather sports 
in general increase thermogenesis, or the burning of extra calories to 
maintain the homeostasis of your temperature at about 98.6.
• It’s a fantastic, “mindful” activity (like Nordic or cross-country skiing) that 
allows you to join people of all ages in doing something healthy, or to 
be alone in a wilderness environment and escape urban-type lethargy 
and stress. Yes, it’s friluftsliv!
• It’s not a slow, endurance-focused type of activity with consequent 
higher oxidative-stress levels and risk of overtraining. Alpine skiing is 
more like sprinting.
Yes, you can use your tools to track Alpine skiing, with very interesting 
results.
Alpine Replay
Alpine Replay is an app for both Android and the iPhone that is specially 
designed to track your ski or snowboard runs, and much more. Similar to the 
other tracking gear we’ve discussed, you basically load it up on your phone, 
switch it on, and put it away as you begin compiling your runs, turns, jumps, 
and aggregate total vertical feet. Later, you log into the site at www.alpin-
ereplay.com to view an impressive collection of statistics, including the total 
time of active skiing, sustained speeds, fastest speed, aggregated vertical 
feet skied, number of runs, where you rank in these categories, etc. 
Downhill skiing is a great  
form of aerobic and anaerobic 
training.

Along with the skiing, the fun begins when you view your stats afterward at 
www.alpinereplay.com. Figure 7-19 shows the charts on a bunch of down-
hill ski runs, including fastest run, fastest sustained speed, where you rank 
among all users (including just within the resort where you skied), the routes 
you took on a Google Map, and more.

More charts caress your eyeballs after you depart the slopes. Figure 7-20 
shows the total distance skied, the vertical drop, the maximum speed, the 
estimated calories burned, and other data. Through the app’s settings, you 
can even have the runs automatically posted to Twitter or Facebook.

The app sports a few differentiating details compared with other tools, 
according to the Alpine Replay website:
We measure speed, airtime, vertical, calories, distance and more, on 
any mountain in the world. Compare and compete with anyone, 
including yourself, with the click of a single button on your iPhone 
or Android. You will see a basic set of stats right on your phone or 
log into the AlpineReplay.com [site] to see even more detailed stats, 
compare and compete between friends, push your stats to Facebook 
and Twitter, or virtually compete against your friends in 3D.
It even boasts of a “patent pending jump detection technology” that’s 
designed to measure your jumps and how much “big air” time you attained. 
I’ll have to measure that one with my son, Scott, as my own “big air” 
time is limited these days. I’m a fairly conservative “stay grounded” 
skier. Alas, Alpine Replay told me I got 0.04 seconds of air on my last 
couple of days—hey, but I did hit 36 mph.
More ski tracking
I have also used Endomondo and Google Earth to track my Alpine ski runs. 
We already described this combination in detail in the “Hiking and Climbing” 
section. In this section, we’ll quickly show you what kind of data and imag-
ery these apps can generate for skiing. Figure 7-21 shows Endomondo’s 
Workouts screen based on a brief, hard alpine ski I initiated in Vermont. 
Figure 7-21. Each ski run is graphed, with speed and elevation

The browser view shows a profile of all your runs. You can trace, with your 
cursor, the yellow line representing each one of your ski runs, finding out the 
speed and elevation. This aspect was actually a bit risky for me, because of 
the natural inclination to beat the last run’s speed rate. Normally a conserva-
tive, under-control skier and still getting the kinks out of my technique, I hit 
around 30+mph on one of those curvilinear runs. I’ve since hit about 42 mph 
on Alpine Replay, but the various phones can be error-prone when reporting 
maximum speed. You can, in other words, gather a lot of interesting trivia on 
your ski runs.
An Olympic Nordic skier can routinely hit 50 mph, and a downhill 
racer 70+ mph!
Again, all you have to do to track ski runs is launch the Endomondo app on 
your smartphone, set it for downhill skiing, and tuck it in a pocket. Once in a 
while you’ll hear the sultry voice tell you that you’ve completed another lap. 
Finally, in the Workouts section of the Endomondo website, export the ski 
runs as a GPX file (with a .gpx suffix). Then open that file up in Google Earth, 
for some more interesting stats and imagery.
It doesn’t matter what kind of name you give the file in your text editor—
skiruns2.gpx would be fine. The data tends to be richer in Google Earth, as 
Figure 7-22 shows. It even has me going 36.8 mph as a top speed (not sure 
how Endomondo and Google Earth are drawing different conclusions about 
speed, using the same data; they apparently use different algorithms).

The GPX file, which is XML markup, includes track points and time-
stamps every few seconds. Using the latitude and longitude points 
(which the tool also captures as XML elements), as well as the time-
stamps, the software tries to capture the speed at which you moved 
from one geographical point to another, just as a GPS watch for run-
ning would do to estimate your pace. People who use GPS for precise 
measurements have tended to complain about the variances in data 
produced by different devices.
Google Earth gives you a nice illustration and overview of your ski runs, in 
terms of the blue line on the mountain. Google Earth will compute your total 
vertical for the ski runs, or the total number of feet you skied down, as the 
elevation loss figure—here, about 3,722 feet. A good day of skiing might 
earn you 15,000 feet or more of vertical. 
Another interesting data point is Max Slope, which represents how steep 
the ski runs can get. Here it was an elevation grade of 48 percent—that’s 
pretty steep. These tools are excellent for analyzing all your downhill ski 
days, and spending the day on impressive mountainous terrain such as Big 
Sky, Montana, Whistler Blackcomb, British Columbia, or Zermatt, Switzerland 
would generate very interesting visuals.
The total vertical for a ski day is similar to the volume for weightlift-
ers— the total amount of pounds or kilograms they lifted during one 
session.
Airport Fitness Hacks
We include an airport fitness section in this chapter because an airport is 
kind of outside of our accustomed realm. If you do much traveling, you’ve 
probably spent a lot of time waiting in or stranded at airports. Let’s see a 
show of hands for people who’ve been trapped at an airport and felt like 
crap!
You can generally get around the forced sedentary behavior of airports by 
crafting your own exercise routine, or perhaps using an airport gym. By 
using the Airport Gyms website (www.airportgyms.com), you can try to find 
a gym or health club at the airport where you will be hanging out. In general, 
good luck with that! 
Testing this app, I got three hits for Boston, but two involved 10-minute taxi 
rides, so they’re not really located at the airport; they’re in hotels that allow 
you to buy a day pass to use their weight machines, which is worth it only if 
you have a very long wait at an airport and want to cough up the taxi and 
gym-pass fare. 
Not very practical. You’re usually waiting to board, or if your flight gets 
bumped, you’re hustling, trying to get on another one.

Airport Fitness Hacks
As for the gym that was within walking distance, a comment included with 
the search result pointed out that one of the hotels was no longer allowing 
day passes, so you do have to check with these facilities beforehand, such 
as by email.
Denver also produced three hits on airport gyms, but all of them required 
taxi rides. A note stated: “Denver’s airport is located such that it can take 
some time to get on and off the ‘compound’.”
San Francisco had a number of possibilities, yet all involved taxi or BART 
subway rides. These aren’t really airport gyms!
I only found gyms located at airports in big hubs like Chicago, so I assume for 
most travelers who don’t want to jump in a cab and actually leave the airport 
for a lengthy time (and expense), these airport gyms do not yet have a lot of 
practical value (the website will be a good resource, however, once airports 
start getting their acts together). Some of the more elite clubs at airports 
might have small workout rooms, which their members can use when they 
aren’t elsewhere in the club drinking scotch and getting massages.
Create Your Own Airport Exercise
Notice a recurring theme in this chapter? 
You can create your own routine at the airport, which is always a good idea 
since we know that endless sitting is very bad in the long run. Plus, all that 
lousy food, stress, jet lag, and lethargy feels crummy in general, right? First, 
just constantly walk, ideally outside, and try to take your carry-on stuff in a 
backpack. This makes it easier to convert your airport waits into weighted 
hikes, which are a good form of exercise. 
Always take the stairs instead of the escalators, always, and walk instead of 
lounging on the conveyor belts or moving sidewalks.
Constantly drink water and refrain from stuffing your gullet with all that 
crappy airport food, like mass-produced pizza, old cellophane-wrapped 
sandwiches, vending-machine junk, and er, um, wine and margaritas. Just 
bring some nuts or grab a piece of fruit once in a while. Fasting is perfect 
for airports.
Beware of the Terminal Zombies
Along with walking, use the hard seats for inverted pushups, meaning push-
ups with your feet off the ground. Do some Hindu pushups on the rug. They 
don’t last long enough to break a sweat, unless you’re waiting in an airport 
in Jakarta, Indonesia (even then, they might be blasting the AC), and just a 
few sets of these pushups are great exercise.
You can probably also find a place to do pull-ups, and who cares what the 
other passengers think! You’ll probably inspire them. Do some deep knee

bends or “air squats” with your backpack on, and if you’re outside in the cool 
weather on tarmac, try some jumping jacks (but with your backpack off for 
those). The trip will be far pleasanter and healthier if you avoid becoming 
just another “terminal zombie.”
Jack Fultz: The 1976 Boston Marathon Winner’s Coaching Tips
We interviewed Jack Fultz, who 
won the Boston Marathon in 
1976 in triple-digit heat, then ran 
a personal best 2:11:17 in 1978. 
He provides personal coaching 
services and teaches at Tufts 
University.
 
Can you provide a little background on your Boston Mara-
thon coaching experience—e.g., how many runners, how 
long you’ve been doing it? Do you still run in Boston or any 
marathons?
I train individuals for Boston and other marathons. The 
Dana-Farber Marathon Challenge team for which I develop 
online training programs and oversee runners’ training-
related issues is comprised of more than 500 runners each 
year now—though we’ve grown to this size over our 23 
years, starting in 1990 with 19 runners.
I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hip in 2000. I had 
it resurfaced in the summer of 2010. Despite some infection 
complications, I’m healthy once again and I work out every 
day—but I run only very sparingly. Biking is my primary 
aerobic activity now, though I swim/ERG/elliptical some-
what regularly as well.
How long is the training program (say, in weeks)?
I created 18-week training calendars for the beginner, inter-
mediate, and advanced marathoners on our DFMC team. 
That’s pretty much what I do for individual clients as well.
What’s the basic routine (I assume it’s molded to the particular 
runner)? How many miles per week? What kind of runs (long, 
slow vs. shorter-tempo runs)? How many rest days per week?
My beginner and advanced programs include only four run-
ning days each week. Two of the non-running days include 
some form of running simulation workout—elliptical ma-
chine, especially the Cybex Arc Trainer, which I believe to be 
the single best running simulation machine on the market 
when set and used appropriately, stationary biking, and/or 
deep water running. 
A lot of variety over various terrains and different speeds of 
training, gradually building over the 18 weeks in terms of 
quality and quantity. My advanced program only includes 
three runs at 20 or more miles but also a few runs at 18 
miles, so there are plenty of long runs—and I encourage my 
runners to run a portion of their long runs at marathon race 
pace if they’re feeling good and strong.
Do you add any interval or track work?
I encourage all my runners, beginners as well, to include 
some form of speed training. That can be as simple as 
including 100-meter long “strides” of quicker paced run-
ning near the end of most of their training runs. But I also 
encourage them to have include at least one run/week 
where they include some running that is quicker than their 
regular steady pace, whether that is just some light fartlek 
running or structured track workouts. Even beginners will 
benefit from the variety and slightly greater challenge that 
“speed” training provides. For a 12-minute miler to run 11 
or 10-minute pace for 200–800 meters constitutes “speed” 
training, even though it isn’t all that fast. It is to them. 
Do you have the runners do any races during the training pe-
riod (e.g., 5k or 10k)? Any cross-training (biking, weightlifting)?
Training races are always a good idea to include, especially 
for the novice racer. The novelty of registering for a race, 
pinning on a number, starting en masse with a starting 
gun/horn, and “speeding” over the course against the clock 
can be intimidating. Running a few races before the big 
marathon eliminates the novelty factor of racing and the 
runner will [be] less nervous or intimidated on marathon 
day. The race also provides a greater training effect than 
most workouts possibly can.
Do you use any of the new technology gizmos and GPS tools 
for endurance athletes, like Nike+?
I use a Garmin Edge with HR for much of my biking. I’m star-
ing to consider using HR for some of my individual clients 
but the larger team is left to their own devices. Many use 
GPS and some of those use HR—but very few use HR as an 
exclusive training guide. But it can be very useful if one is 
well versed on how to use it.

(continued)
Is there a dietary component to your training program? 
I use the standard “see food diet”—I see food and I eat it. 
I believe that eating behavior is often just as important as 
“what” one eats—eating more, smaller meals and healthy 
snacks throughout the day and when eating a complete 
meal, to eat slowly and not overeat at any given time. By 
eating slowly, savoring the flavors of the food, we assist our 
digestive system by swallowing our food in near-liquid form 
and we’re much more likely to stop eating when our hunger 
has been satiated rather than when we’re uncomfortably 
full.
If you were competing in Boston in 2011, what would you do 
differently compared with your regimen in 1976?
I’d include a lot more of the alternative training I mentioned 
above. At the height of my racing career I’d average 125 
miles/week for 10–12 weeks in preparation for a marathon. 
That’s a lot of pounding and I’m sure most national and 
world-class marathoners suffer through a lot of overtrain-
ing injuries and lesser overtraining symptoms of fatigue 
and body ache that could be eliminated by replacing 
some/many of the body-pounding road miles with time 
on a Cybex Arc Trainer or doing deep water running. That’s 
where we go now when injured—but they could serve a 
runner much more as a preventative tool. I’m an absolute 
believer in this and I believe I could train a healthy runner 
for a marathon just as effectively, and maybe more so, by 
having them do the majority of their training via these safer 
modalities. They’d require less recovery time between hard 
workouts, thus being able to do more intensity training and 
significantly reduce the likelihood of losing training time 
due to injury.

Your friend, the guy or gal who you can tell you anything, wanders into your 
cubicle, clearly with something on his mind. “Dude, get in shape,” is all he 
says, then unceremoniously walks away. You figure he’s right; the encounter 
had a “right on the money” vibe to it. What’s the first thing you do?
You join a local gym, the one that everyone’s joining lately, or that one on the 
way to work that you got a couple of guest passes to but never bothered to 
visit. “Gym” is also considered an antiquated term for it; the numerous fitness 
franchises are running out of brand names for their fitness facilities, and they 
all have a different angle, and machines, and gizmos. 
Now What?
So you’ve joined up and shown up. Now what? You see crowds of people 
milling around and on machines. It’s like that scene in the film Gattaca with 
Ethan Hawke trying to pretend he’s Jude Law on the treadmill, except there 
are ellipticals, cycle spinners, StairMasters, and more. You haven’t even ven-
tured into the football-field-sized mecca of stationary weight machines and 
barbells. It’s kind of scary, jarring, but you want to do more than sit down at 
the juice bar, order a 12-ounce “Seattle’s Best,” and ogle the people saunter-
ing by in their Lycra. 
You can get one of the in-house trainers to show you around, but while 
that’s a good idea for the first time, you don’t necessarily want to get sucked 
into their way of doing things, and it costs a lot more. Besides, these fitness 
facilities aren’t really that different from each other, and a fully equipped one 
commonly has everything you need to get strong and fit. 
This chapter describes the kinds of exercises and routines you can focus on 
in a typical modern gym. There are dozens of them, in reality, so we’re 
only going to get you started with about 15 of them, including photos, 
then point you in the direction of good websites that contain many 
exercise descriptions and demonstration videos.

Lifting Is a Good Focus

We’re also going to introduce a few smartphone apps that make a good 
accompaniment to working out in a gym, or home, or hotel room—but only 
if you have the patience and time to make screen choices and enter data, 
during or after a workout. 
These include Men’s Health Workouts, Fitocracy’s mobile app, and a workout 
tracker at www.bodybuilder.com (there are dozens of fitness apps, however, 
so we recommend if you’re an app aficionado that you do some exploring 
on your own). We’ll also briefly discuss the CrossFit philosophy and facilities 
that are cropping up all over the place.
Before you hit the gym, it’s of paramount importance to get some instruction 
on the proper technique for lifting weights. The excellent site Bodybuilder.
com, for example, has a comprehensive collection of demonstration videos 
on just about any exercise with weights you can think of.
Before we get into all that, though, let’s get some lightweight philosophy 
and terminology out of the way. 
Lifting Is a Good Focus
By now you might be wondering why the chapter focuses on the “lifting 
weights” angle. A gym offers all kinds of routines, including all those cardio 
machines, not to mention Yoga, Pilates, Zumba, and countless variations on 
those movement scenarios. Since we realistically cannot cover everything 
you can possibly do in a gym or fitness place, we’re not going to try. We’re 
also going to venture out on a limb and recommend resistance exercise or 
strength routines as the main activity to focus on in the gym.
You can, of course, use any piece of equipment, machine, or class you want 
upon entrance to a facility (such as for a warm-up), but in terms of health 
and fitness, a solid resistance-exercise routine will get you the most bang for 
your buck, for the following reasons, among others:
• Adding lean mass or muscle counteracts one of the principal effects of 
aging, which is the loss of lean mass or muscle. If we age in a Western 
society without doing anything to resist the typical influences of the 
lifestyle, our body composition changes: we lose muscle as we gain fat. 
It can begin happening fairly early in life, such as the late 30s or 40s. 
This development is, by definition, unhealthy. We need fat to survive. A 
normal distribution of adipose tissue is an amazingly efficient form of 
energy storage and regulation. However, lots of extra fat is evidence that 
the calories you consume exceed your total energy expenditure (TEE, or 
the amount of calories you burn off each day) and that your metabolism 
has begun to go south on you. Extra fat is bad for your internal organs; 
a robust distribution of extra muscle is healthy for your internal organs. 
The medical community has even invented a fancy, disease-sounding 
name for this condition of losing muscle: sarcopenia. It’s considered 
such a threat to the health of an aging population that—you guessed 
Adding lean mass or muscle 
counteracts one of the principal 
effects of aging, which is the 
loss of lean mass or muscle.

Lifting Is a Good Focus
it—the pharmaceutical industry is going all out to invent a pill to com-
bat sarcopenia. You don’t need a pill. Just lift weights.
• Resistance training is another fertile area for geeks gathering and 
analyzing data, on routines, weight lifted, reps, total volume, and prog-
ress—and that might be the most stimulating aspect of lifting weights, 
at least in the beginning.
• For the younger among us, resistance training helps you to realize your 
athletic goals, whether it’s sprinting on a track or bicycle, a team sport, 
or using your upper body to hit or throw a tennis ball, baseball, or 
lacrosse ball. Resistance training, when done correctly, will increase your 
strength, by an impressive magnitude—possibly 100 percent, depend-
ing on the baseline you start from. Yes, you can double your strength. 
• Resistance training helps avoid injuries by strengthening muscle fiber, 
connective tissue (such as ligaments and tendons), and bone mass (yes, 
a person who lifts weights has greater bone density than someone who 
doesn’t). Ever gotten a serious injury, one that happened while you 
were doing something relatively innocuous such as bending over to 
lift something or stepping on stairs the wrong way; one that took you 
out of school, work, life for weeks or months? Ever considered an easy-
to-adopt routine that makes sure this never happens in the first place, 
or ever has to happen again? (Losing excess weight is also an injury-
preventive measure.)
• The practical effects of being stronger cannot be overemphasized or 
quantified—think of all the “heavy work” you have to do in ordinary life, 
from lifting items around the house (including people and children) to 
performing physical tasks around the yard or at work. Ever since I got 
back into weights with greater seriousness a few years ago, I’ve noticed 
a huge difference in this area. 
• Resistance training counts as anaerobic and aerobic cardiovascular train-
ing. In other words, resistance training will give you significantly better 
oxygen capacity for walking up hills and stairs, carrying loads, and just 
getting around in life. Anaerobic training means utilizing energy in 
the absence of a continuous replenishment of oxygen, as in sprinting. 
Aerobic exercise involves utilizing a more or less continuous supply of 
oxygen as you breathe and run, bike, or swim, for instance. Weightlifting 
helps both areas. Ever noticed how much you’re huffing and puffing 
after high-intensity resistance training? (We’ll explain that term in more 
detail shortly.) It follows that if a muscle has more capacity for pulling 
a given weight, you will use less oxygen doing so. In addition, your car-
diovascular mechanics—the heart, lungs, capillaries, and veins, along 
with the brain, liver, even the endocrine system (all of the glands that 
secrete the all-important hormones that rule what goes on in your body, 
such as growth hormone, testosterone, and the adrenal hormones like  
Resistance training will give 
you significantly better oxygen 
capacity for walking up hills 
and stairs, carrying loads, and 
just getting around life.

epinephrine and cortisol)—all of these systems must upregulate to sup-
port this new muscle fiber you are adding.
• New muscle fiber increases your basal metabolic rate (BMR—see 
Chapter 9), or the amount of calories you burn at rest or during normal 
activities, but not by the degree that people typically assume it does. 
If you add 10 pounds of muscle to your body, for example, your calo-
rie burn increases by about 60 to 100 calories per day (about 6 to 10 
calories per pound of muscle per day). The benefits of new muscle and 
weight training are greater strength, injury prevention, balance, and 
metabolic health, not necessarily more calories burned per day.
• Cardiovascular work is usually initiated at the expense of resistance train-
ing. Unless you’re running or biking at a high intensity (such as doing 
Tabata sprints), the value of these exercises for most people is minimal. 
Excess cardio, for example, actually burns up or catabolizes your lean 
mass (so it can contribute to weakening during the aging process). 
“Despite increased testosterone, hypertrophy does not typically take 
place with aerobic endurance training. In fact, oxidative stress may actu-
ally promote a decrease in muscle fiber size in order to optimize oxygen 
transport into the cell. Without the proper exercise stimulus, the cellular 
mechanisms that mediate muscle fiber growth are not activated to the 
extent that hypertrophy [muscle growth] occurs.”1 This means that too 
much running or biking could make some of your muscles smaller.
Negative Weightlifting Biases: Get Over Them
If you’re reluctant to try weightlifting because it seems like foreign territory 
for you—a clique or cult you do not want to join—I urge you to rethink 
your decision and try to expel the negative stereotypes. Try to ban these 
biases and images from your head—that weightlifting is just for adoles-
cents (including adolescent-acting adults) who are trying to look like the 
Incredible Hulk or young Arnold, or people who are incarcerated and try-
ing to make their tattoos look bigger by increasing the surface area of the 
underlying muscle. 
Weightlifting is for everybody, including octogenarians and nonagenar-
ians—people between the ages of 90 and 99. Most gyms could probably 
give you some great stories about elderly people who have gotten stronger 
and healthier (physical strength does equate to health) since starting a 
resistance-training program. 
I didn’t know I was a quinquagenarian (between the ages of 50 and 
59; if you want to see all those fun names for ages, go to http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing#Dividing_the_lifespan). 
Weightlifting, including high-intensity training, is also absolutely very good 
for women. They often turn out to be better at it than a lot of men are.
The benefits of new muscle 
and weight training are greater 
strength, injury prevention, 
balance, and metabolic health, 
not necessarily more calories 
burned per day.

Negative Weightlifting Biases: Get Over Them
When Weightlifting Is Work: Two NFL Football Players’ Perspectives 
on Training
Jim Turner was a wide receiver, 
returned kicks, and played 
special teams with the Carolina 
Panthers about 10 years ago, and 
Chris Crocker, a safety with the 
Cincinnati Bengals, is a 10-year 
veteran. He’s played for three 
other teams: Cleveland, Atlanta, 
and Miami. Both of them, 
obviously, know their way around a gym and strength 
building. Turner (“J.T.”) is 6’ 4” and played at about 210 
pounds; Crocker is listed on his Bengals web bio page at 5’ 
11”, 197 pounds. I interviewed them at separate times 
during the winter of 2012, near the close of the National 
Football League (NFL) season.
What was your greatest thrill as an NFL player?
J.T.: I got to meet Jerry Rice on the field before we played 
the 49ers my rookie year. Even when you’re in the NFL you 
still looked up to these guys when you were young.
What kinds of off-season strength routines did you do?
J.T.: We spent the off-season working out—back in the old 
days they actually had an off-season; [but for us] even the 
workouts that were not mandatory had a high attendance. 
The type of strength routines you did depended on your 
strength coach; I had three different coaches with three 
different strategies.
For upper-body day (typically Monday) the routines 
involved triceps work, pushups, pull-ups, deadlifts, ma-
chine pull-downs with the Smith machines; and “curls for 
girls”—guys like to look good in their uniform. For leg days, 
we [did] not do squats with the bar because of the back 
issue—we did more push squats, the leg press, one-legged 
squats, calf raises, a lot of hamstring and quad exercises be-
cause that’s where a lot of injuries come from. You have to 
make sure those muscles are strengthened and balanced.
With pro sports and resistance training, we fundamentally 
[design workouts] that will help us do what we have to do 
during the game: sprints (e.g., short sprints like 40s; “two-
mile runs would be distance training for an NFL player”), 
squats, deadlifts, a lot of people do deadlifts—because 
that’s the stuff that makes you strong. That’s the core stuff 
that works. I see people do esthetic stuff that really doesn’t 
help them, when I go to the gym now. 
Crocker: In most teams that I’ve been on it’s mandatory that you 
lift twice a week, one upper body, one lower body. Some of the 
guys do their own thing and lift three to four times a week.
Its different everywhere—this is the fourth team I’ve played 
on and my 10th season. You go through different phases—
the older you get, the fewer heavy weights you use—you 
try to focus on elasticity and flexibility; you’re still trying 
to be explosive, but you’re going about it in a different 
way. Things like TRX bands come into play [www.trxtrain-
ing.com/]. We’re using a lot of the same things [amateur 
athletes] use. You do a lot of things that require muscle-
memory—football-specific stuff. 
Looking back, would you have done anything different 
training-wise (e.g., rest for athletes seems to have greater ap-
preciation nowadays)?
J.T.: Yes, yes, yes, more rest, more sleep. I got into yoga later, 
but I would have implemented more flexibility into the pro-
gram earlier. I would have warmed up better. I ran track in 
college and high school and one thing I learned from that 
sport was that you almost have to warm up to exhaustion. I 
would have integrated more warm-up into my NFL routine, 
practice-and game-wise. 
Another thing is that the guys don’t really like to work out. 
Everyone is self-motivated, but there’s a reason why the 
NFL fines you for missing workouts. Just because they’re 
professional athletes, don’t think that they wake up in the 
morning and say “Wow, I can’t wait to get to the gym.” That’s 
far from the case.
Tell your readers, everyone’s in the same boat. Human be-
ings don’t like to [do those kinds of workouts]—it doesn’t 
feel good for anybody; it’s not supposed to feel good, but at 
the end of the day the results are there. 
Crocker: I’m satisfied [with the approach his strength 
coaches used]. [When I asked him whether it was true that 
the resistance training isn’t very fun, he answered:] I would 
say that it’s not fun trying to maintain the strength—when 
you’re younger you lift and gain strength fast. When you’re 
older you have to work twice as hard [to maintain the same 
level of power]. You’re already consumed with trying to 
play the sport, the last thing you want to worry about is 
maintaining [muscle-specific strength]. That’s why later on 
I have focused on trying to be flexible and explosive. [With 
weightlifting] you can get into areas where you’re too big 
for your position; you don’t see quarterbacks bench press-
ing 500 pounds, like an offensive lineman.
Do you use any of those Super Slow techniques that are popu-
lar in some weightlifting circles?
Crocker: We don’t do anything slow in football.

A Few Jock and Physiology Terms,  
as Promised
A term you’re usually going to come across while analyzing your gym 
workouts is total energy expenditure (TEE). We have previously defined basal 
metabolic rate (BMR) as the energy expended keeping your brain and basic 
systems going—in practical terms, the amount of calories you would burn 
if you were motionless all day. It’s basically a calculated figure to help deter-
mine your daily caloric needs—you don’t really want to be motionless all day! 
Your TEE is your BMR plus the calories you burn moving and exercising all 
day. If you want to be really specific, the TEE equals your BMR plus exercise-
oriented thermogenesis (generating heat by moving about) plus the calo-
ries expended by non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). 
The latter term means “the energy expended for everything that is not sleep-
ing, eating, or sports-like exercise.”2 For example, all that activity that I’ve 
mentioned that doesn’t have anything to do with a formal workout: walk-
ing places, going up and down stairs, chasing the dog, answering the door, 
doing chores and taking the trash out. What the Fitbit tends to measure is 
NEAT. 
TEE is the most practical measure of the amount of energy you’re expend-
ing in a day, and it’s a useful number to compare to your total caloric intake. 
Generally, you will gain weight if your caloric intake, as measured by a tool 
such as FitDay (www.fitday.com), exceeds your TEE. This isn’t always a bad 
thing. If you want to put on a substantive amount of muscle, you will have 
to provide the raw materials in the form of food and calories. You will not 
only have to consume quality protein and plenty of fats to burn off, you will 
generally have to be in a calories-surplus state to add muscle weight to your 
body.
TEE Formula
A journal article from October 20063 (Preventing Chronic Disease; www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1784117/) provides us with a couple of equa-
tions or formulas that give a close approximation of how many calories you 
are burning by just humming along throughout the day and perhaps hitting 
the gym afterward. 
The largest portion of these calories is referred to as the basal energy 
expenditure (BEE), also known as the BMR. Remember, this is the amount of 
calories your body expends just keeping its own cells and systems going for 
about 24 hours. The formula is long, but not that complicated:
BEE = 293 − 3.8 × age (years) + 456.4 × height (meters) + 10.12 × weight 
(kg)

A Few Jock and Physiology Terms, as Promised 
I plugged in my age, weight, and height and came up with about 
1,500 calories. Of course, the various formulas and tools you use for 
estimating the BMR will not always spit out the same number. My 
Tanita body-composition scale specifies around 1,680 for my BMR, 
and a previous formula we discussed estimated 1,440. It’s often a fairly 
rough estimation.
For women, the formula from the article looks like this: 
BEE = 247 − 2.67 × age (years) + 401.5 × height (meters) + 8.6 × weight 
(kg)
What about a more realistic figure for the amount of calories you are going 
to burn off via all of your gym activities? You figure out the TEE by using this 
formula:
TEE = 864 − 9.72 × age (years) + PA × [(14.2 × weight (kg) + 503 × height 
(meters)]
What’s PA? It represents a physical activity rating for the day (I’ve condensed 
that aspect of the formula for the sake of brevity; the scientific article 
describes a more lengthy way of scoring separate activities by their meta-
bolic equivalent of task—MET—and thus reaching a PA level for them). Here 
are the numerical options for the PA part of this equation:
Men:
Sedentary: PA = 1.0
Low active: PA = 1.12
Active: PA = 1.27
Very active: PA = 1.54
Women:
Sedentary: PA = 1.0
Low active: PA = 1.14
Active: PA = 1.27
Very active: PA = 1.45
Assume that I downhill-skied all day in the cold, or did a lot of walking plus 
my hardest bout of high-intensity weight training. With my age (55), height 
(1.7 meters), and weight (65 kilograms) plugged in, here is what the formula 
looks like (some sets of parentheses added by me).
The formula itself: TEE = 864 − 9.72 × age (years) + PA × [(14.2 × weight 
(kg) + 503 × height (meters)]
With values: TEE = ((864 - (9.72 × 55)) + ((1.54 (PA)) × [(14.2 × 65 + 503 × 
1.7)])) = 3,068 calories

Top 40 HIT: High-Intensity Training
Chapter 8

That’s a close enough approximation of how many calories I would burn 
during a high-activity day, but the number seems to inhabit the low end of 
the range. It would not be surprising if the various tools that people use to 
estimate their TEEs use this and similar formulas. 
Top 40 HIT: High-Intensity Training
High-intensity training, or HIT, is generally the kind of weight training that 
uses high weights and low reps. As resistance training has many different 
formats and camps, and triggers much web forum debate, the HIT routines 
tend to have their strong advocates and committed detractors (the opposite 
of HIT would be using light weights, multiple sets, and high reps). 
Setting aside the hyperanalysis among the lifting cognoscenti (just Google 
the term “high intensity training,” and you’ll see plenty of lengthy discussions 
and articles), I tend to apply HIT to weights, as well as sprinting for runners 
or cyclists—anything that is conducive to intensity. 
Any short-term exercise that is anaerobic in nature and tends to hit the big 
muscle groups with an all-out effort is HIT, as far as I’m concerned. I suppose 
it’s an issue of semantics; you can drill down to more specific applications of 
this term if you’d like. When performed correctly and falling far short of caus-
ing injury, the HIT routines are some of the most effective fitness regimens 
for any program.
Mountaineering Guide: When Your Job Is Your Fitness Routine
Only in recent 
history have 
humans created 
separate time 
segments in 
their lives for 
workouts and 
fitness. Right up 
until the modern 
era (when the 
running and 
outdoor-rec 
booms began in 
earnest, during 
the seventies), many people had ordinary lives that kept 
them in pretty good shape by default. Now you have to 
look for such lifestyles. I emailed Matt Hegeman of Alpine 
Ascents (Seattle, Washington), who was my lead guide on 
a 2011 Mt. Rainier climb, about whether he had a fitness 
regimen for keeping him ready in the big mountains. In a 
word, “No.”
“My fitness regimen may not be very easy to put a finger 
on since I don’t really have one,” he said. “My fitness comes 
by doing. For example, in the summer for work I climb 
Rainier and on my days off I’ll go rock climbing. No time for 
training. If I want to get in better shape for rock climbing, 
I go rock climbing 3–5 [times] per week. If I want to get in 
better shape for skiing, I go skiing 3–5 [times] per week. My 
lifestyle allows me to do this. I guess you could say that my 
lifestyle is my training regimen.”
Hegeman recently participated in a guided climb of 
Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest mountain outside the 
Himalaya at 22,841 feet above sea level. He called it “Acon-
slogua” due to the merciless uphill but not often technical 
terrain of the climb. I can attest to the fact that the lifestyle 
will keep you in shape, simply based on our final Rainier 
day: about 3,400 feet up at midnight, followed by a 9,000-
foot descent. On guiding days, a guide will burn thousands 
of calories, perhaps up to 7,000. And what did Hegeman 
and some of the other guides have planned for the follow-
ing week (after maybe half a day’s rest)? Another five-day 
guided tour of Mt. Rainer’s Emmons Glacier. Alpine Ascent’s 
home is at www.alpineascents.com/guides.asp.

Resistance-Training Terms
Resistance-Training Terms
Before we describe certain routines, we’re going to get some basic resistance-
training terms out of the way. 
Reps ‘n’ Sets
The repetitions, or reps, are the number of times you lift a weight before you 
take a rest. For example, 10 reps of a bench press at a certain weight involves 
executing the bench press 10 times in a row without racking the bar/weight 
and 15 reps of Hindu pushups simply means doing this type of pushup 15 
times. A set is a group of reps that you do before resting or moving on to a 
set of another activity, as in “one set of 10 reps.” Imagine an egg carton as a 
set and the eggs as reps. A typical egg carton is one set of 12 reps (unless it’s 
a baker’s dozen, then it would be 13 reps).
Of course, there are many more notations for sets and reps, including forms 
of shorthand. Although many people (including me) just keep track in their 
heads, others like to write down what they’ve accomplished in the gym, or 
check notes describing their workouts. In order to reduce writing or typing, 
you can write “3 x 10 x 150# or kg,” meaning “three sets of 10 reps each at 
150 pounds or kilograms”—kg—a kilogram is 2.2 pounds. Or you can use 
something slightly more verbose, such as “150 lb x 3 reps x 3 sets.”
Sessions and Volume
A session is one workout, as in a weightlifting session. A session usually 
contains more than one exercise and more than one set, but it doesn’t have 
to. Your training routine will include a certain number of sessions per week, 
from one to up to four or more if you’re an experienced weight trainer.
You can also keep track of the total volume lifted in the session, day, or week, 
or even within a time period (say, in a set of bench presses with short rests 
between each rep). Volume is the total amount of pounds or kilograms you 
lifted during an exercise or a session. For example, if you did 10 reps of bench 
presses at 150 pounds, the volume was 1,500 pounds. 
Volume is impressive and motivating—as in, “Hey, I lifted three tons of 
weight during that session!” But it may not be as relevant as the incre-
mental gains you are making in strength for the different exercises. 
Volume is a statistical or aggregate figure that has anecdotal value at 
best (as in, “During my lifetime, I’ve run the equivalent of once around 
the equator”).

Resistance-Training Terms

The RMs: Repetition Maximum
Repetition maximum, or RM, is a term that’s bandied about a great deal 
in weightlifting circles. RM is a way to express the relative intensity of an 
exercise, so one repetition maximum, or “1RM,” for the squat would be the 
most weight you could squat one rep. As another example, if you can bench 
press 200 pounds once, your 1RM for the bench press is, you guessed it, 200 
pounds. 
Higher RMs reflect the weight that you can lift for multiple reps, not just one. 
For example, 5RM for the military press is the weight that you can presently 
do five repetitions of for that exercise (it will, of course, change as you get 
stronger). 
Similarly, 10RM for the leg press is the weight that you can push on the leg 
press for 10 reps. The higher the RM, the lower the weight; your 1RM for the 
bench press might be 200 pounds, but your 10RM might be 150 pounds.
Your RMs can also, of course, be specified in kilograms—1 kilogram 
(kg) equals 2.2 pounds (lb).
As you might have guessed, the “protocol” or the plan for your weight rou-
tine might not change as rapidly as your increase in strength. For example, 
midway through your routine, Tuesday’s schedule might call for 5RM of the 
deadlift. When you first started lifting weights, this might have been 100 
pounds. Now you can do 155 pounds five times, or more, but the exercise is 
still referred to as “5RM deadlift.”
Percentages of RM
A weight for a particular exercise is often referred to as a percentage of RM. 
Let’s say you wanted to start off an exercise with a set of weights that was 
not quite as difficult as 10RM (the weight you can only do 10 reps of before 
you’re maxed out). The level of intensity could be referred to as “80 per-
cent of 10RM.” If your 10RM is 150 pounds, 80 percent of your 10RM is 120 
pounds. Or you could be doing a high-intensity session that falls just short 
of an all-out effort, such as “85 to 90 percent 1RM.”
How do you know what your 1RM is? You could perform a 1RM test with spot-
ters, say, on the bench press (a certain safety technique by which one or two 
spotters can steady or lift up the bar if you fail to complete the rep—very 
important with exercises like the bench press). That can be kind of risky, 
though, particularly for beginners. At least one equation exists for estimat-
ing the 1RM based on lifting multiple reps with a lighter weight. 
The formula goes like this: 1RM = ((# of reps) / 30 + 1) x weight lifted 
The higher the RM, the lower 
the weight; your 1RM for the 
bench press might be 200 
pounds, but your 10RM might 
be 150 pounds.

Hello, Gym! Finding Your Way Around the Fitness Facility
207
What’s Your Plan? How Many Sets and Reps
For example, say you lifted 150 pounds 11 times, or for 11 reps. The equation 
will look like: (11/30 + 1) x 150 = 205. This equation estimates that your 1RM 
for that exercise is 205 pounds.4 
The “predictions [based on estimations] are more accurate when the 
equations are based on loads equal to or less than a 10RM,” and they 
get more accurate the closer you get to 1RM, according to the excel-
lent reference book Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning.5 
In other words, the amount you can do for 5RM or 3RM is a more accurate 
predictor of your 1RM than your 10RM.
What’s Your Plan? How Many Sets and Reps
Alright, enough of the RMs. Exactly how many sets and reps do you perform 
for each exercise? 
So you’ve decided that you are going to initiate a resistance-training routine 
involving the bench press, the deadlift, and the bicep curl in one session. 
How many sets are you going to do for one session? In instances when you 
are using a trainer, this plan will be handed to you, for better or worse (you 
can tell I like to design my own training sessions).
This issue is another area of great debate among resistance trainers. The 
protocol or scheme, a kind of recipe for what combination of sets and reps 
will make you stronger for each exercise, will often be different for each 
trainer or expert you consult. There are numerous different protocols for 
weightlifting, which just means that you have a lot of room for variety and 
experimentation.
The rule of thumb is that “lower reps, higher weights,” closer to your 
1RM for each exercise, will help build power and muscle. Higher reps, 
lower weights will help increase muscular endurance.
The protocal should take into account whether you are a beginner, when 
you’re probably starting off with higher reps and lower weights, or an expe-
rienced personal weight trainer.
Everyone is different, in terms of factors such as baseline fitness, strength, 
and age, when they begin weight-training programs. Another major con-
sideration is the goal of your resistance-training program. Someone who’s a 
competitive power lifter has a different goal than a geek who is just trying to 
get fitter. One strategy is to try different protocols and see what makes you 
stronger and what works for you.
There are actually three components to a protocal: the actual weight you’ll 
be lifting, the number of sets in one session, and the number of reps per set 
(not to mention the different exercises that will comprise one session and 
the number of days during the week you will work out).

The 1-Set Method
I know a good athlete who prefers doing one set of 10 reps to “failure,” or 
10RM, for each exercise. This is easy to remember, but it can be a little dif-
ficult at first for inexperienced lifters to determine how much weight to use. 
10RM is about 75 percent of your 1RM, so if you have already determined 
that in the leg press machine, say, your 1RM is 160 pounds, then your 10RM 
should be about 120 pounds.
What if you don’t know what your 1RM is? How do you know what failure 
is? In this case, you can just make a subjective determination that “I can’t 
do another rep” (but never do this unspotted with exercises that could be 
risky, such as the bench press!). The more experience you gain as a resis-
tance trainer the easier it will be to tell when you’re reaching your “failure” 
point. Similar to that feeling of “I don’t have one more sprint interval left,” the 
muscles are quivering and you’re building up a lot of tightness or lactic acid, 
which is a byproduct of the muscle’s energy output. 
An old chestnut for track workouts or intervals is to finish your interval 
session when you feel that you can only do one more sprint.
Pre-Exhaustion
Another scheme for determining sets and reps is to use a lighter weight and 
multiple reps to “pre-exhaust” the muscle group first, before you hit it with 
a heavier set, such as 85% of 1RM. This method also offers the advantage 
of warming up the muscle group and lets you smooth out your technique 
first without the pressure of having to tackle the heaviest weight. The first 
set might be considered aerobic, while the second set is anaerobic, roughly 
similar to sprinting at 75 percent of max speed for 100 yards prior to going 
all-out for 100 yards.
Still another variation is the inverse of pre-exhaustion, where you follow up 
a hard set with a high-rep, lighter-weight set. The idea is that the first set 
fatigues the powerful, fast-fatiguing Type II muscle fibers, while the second 
set takes care of the less powerful, slower-fatiguing Type I fibers.
Vary your routine; do both methods. Mix things up. Combine a body-weight 
exercise with a hard barbell exercise. For example, I will follow up a hard 
set of bench presses with a set of inverted pushups (feet on the bench), to 
failure.

GAIN and WODs
The two tools we discuss in Chapter 9, GAIN Fitness (www.gainfitness.com) 
and a “workout of the day” generator, also offer some insight into sets and 
reps. GAIN Fitness recommends two sets of 12–13 reps for each exercise, 
with a 40-second rest between sets. They include body-weight-type exer-
cises, barbells, and kettlebells (these are basically cannonballs with handles, 
a popular new tool in CrossFit circles). 
Here’s what The WOD Shop (www.wodshop-service.org/getWod.do) gener-
ated for me when I requested a workout involving lifting weights:
Rest 1 minute between rounds, add 10# per round, continue until 
failure: 2x Back squat (185#/95#)
Unless I’m misinterpreting these instructions, what they are specifying 
here is, “Do one rep of back squats with 185 pounds, then one rep with 95 
pounds; rest one minute; add 10 pounds to each exercise and do the same 
thing.”  The exercise calls for unlimited rounds “to failure,” meaning you keep 
doing these sets, two reps each, until you can’t any more. There’s always a 
minute between the “rounds” (which in this case encompasses one set and 
two reps).
Low-Rep Methods
You’ve probably concluded by now that there are countless variations or 
schemes for sets and reps. I’ve seen schemes where lifters have done 10 or 
more sets of 3 reps for the same exercise, over and over again with a heavy 
weight, or 5 sets of 5 reps at 5RM. 
My wife’s training facility uses four sets for each exercise, but they don’t 
count reps, they have the athletes perform reps for 45 seconds, with short 
rests between sets.
The bottom line with resistance training when choosing these schemes is 
that heavier weights with exercises that recruit more muscle groups, and 
lower RMs, produce the best results. Hormones send signals to the cells to 
synthesize new protein, and thus new muscle. Hormones rule! You can eat 
as much protein and take as many supplements as you want, but the signal 
to make new muscle is delivered by a hormone—and involves the mTOR 
pathway.
To make more lean mass for your body, you have to use the routines that 
best cultivate muscle-building or anabolic hormones such as testosterone 
and growth hormone.

Here’s another quote on this matter from Essentials of Strength Training and 
Conditioning: 
When the intensity used was 10RM (heavy resistance) with three sets 
of each exercise (high total work, approximately 60,000 J) and short 
(1-minute) rest periods, large increases were observed in serum 
[growth hormone] GH concentrations. The most dramatic increases 
occurred in response to a 1-minute rest period when the duration of 
exercise was longer (10RM vs. 5RM).6 
Sample Routine From a BBS Guy
It is instructive to examine a brief rundown on what other 
dedicated athletes do for exercise. Bob Watson is a Spanish 
teacher and cross-country coach (his teams do far more 
variety than run training—I’ve trained with them). I asked 
him what kind of weight routine he does.
“I try to do all of my workouts fasted, and I am just start-
ing a Doug McGuff–style protocol,” he told me. Dr. Doug 
McGuff wrote the excellent book Body by Science, which, 
in a nutshell, recommends a high-intensity routine about 
once per week, or even once every 10 days or more. He 
argues, using good scientific data, that it takes that long 
for the muscles to legitimately heal and rebuild after the 
workout, which is to failure. Dr. McGuff writes convincingly 
about the futility of overtraining. Read the book (its method 
is referred to as BBS) if you want to learn something about 
exercise physiology.
“I lift 2x/week: day 1 is pull-downs and overhead press,” 
Bob said. “Day two is chest press, seated row, and leg press. 
All exercises are one set to failure. I like fasted workouts 
because I go all out and don’t worry about any food in my 
stomach. I feel sharp physically when I am fasting—energy 
level is good, and I feel ready to go.” 
“Also, “he continued,” I work hard looking forward to that 
big meal after the workout (more leangains.com influence 
here). Maybe some would caution against this if one is try-
ing to lose weight, but I’m trying to gain, so it works for me. 
It’s a bit too early to track strength gains. Energy levels are 
good throughout the day. I used to lean on a cup of coffee 
after lunch every day to get through afternoon classes, but 
now find I can take it or leave it—I don’t feel fatigued in the 
afternoon. So if I want a warm drink, I’ll have a cup of decaf, 
maybe with some heavy cream (especially if I’m looking to 
add calories on a workout day).”
Split Routines and Compound Sets
A split routine involves using resistance training for the upper body one day 
and the lower body another, allowing each muscle group to rest. This is very 
common, and allows you to train on multiple days without overtraining, if 
you do it right. 
A compound set, on the other hand, includes two exercises in the same set. 
The exercises target the same muscle group, as in performing hammer curls 
for the biceps followed by some biceps curls. 
With all that said, it’s about time that we started describing particular rou-
tines and weightlifting exercises.

Grand Entry, Time to Warm Up
Grand Entry, Time to Warm Up
Now you’ve made your grand entry to the gym, and you’ve avoided using 
the juice bar as a cop-out refuge. You probably want to do some kind of 
warm-up, and if it’s a cardio-related warm-up you are comfortable with, such 
as sitting on a bike and pedaling for 10 minutes, then have at it. 
Personally, I feel that this is a waste of time, and a bit tedious. Why do they 
provide modern treadmills and stationary cycles with TV monitors, so that 
you can watch Real New Jersey Housewives during your warm-up (or is it Real 
Desperate Dallas Housewives—I don’t know, some combination of “real” and 
“desperate”)? Because everyone assumes that spinning or treadmilling is 
boring, and people require auxiliary entertainment just to get through it. 
What I do for warm-ups is a set of dips, and sometimes some push-ups or 
pull-ups. It only takes a minute, and it gets my blood pumping and my heart 
rate going. I usually feel the need to stretch out my lower back, so I assume 
a yoga position called the “child’s pose” (see Figure 8-1). Then I take a long 
wooden staff (most gyms keep these around) and I limber up my back and 
legs with the staff on my shoulders, sort of like a yoke. This is all over in min-
utes, and I’m on to my first routine. 
Figure 8-1. This yoga move can figure into your warm-up
You can also add or use a first set of lightweight resistance training, as 
described in “Pre-Exhaustion,” as a warm-up, or do a more conventional 
warm-up, like swimming, which is an excellent loosening activity for the 
muscles.

Now I’m going to introduce several resistance-training exercises. I’ll accom-
pany them with pictures, and, whenever available, link them to a video clip 
or some other explanatory site. I’m going to start with five go-to routines 
that use some of the body’s larger muscle groups and are proven strength-
builders: the bench press, the military press, the deadlift, the leg press, 
and the back squat. These are tried-and-true resistance-training exercises, 
and while some have fallen into disfavor on the Internet among hardcore 
weightlifters (e.g., the bench press), putting these five exercises together will 
doubtlessly help you increase all-body strength and fitness. 
Along the way, you can check out the sidebars, which are examples of 
routines and interviews with workout mavens. Even if you had a resistance-
training program that involved only these five routines, you could still 
expect to get good results (provided you lifted enough weight, that is). 
The Spartacus Workout: 10 Minutes of Healthy Turmoil
I love 10-minute workouts, like the “10-minute pull-up 
marathon” (do as many chin-ups or pull-ups as you can in 
10 minutes). A good 10-minute routine is a marvel of ef-
ficiency and intensity (and you’re not working out, shower-
ing, dressing, etc. for two and a half hours…), and will make 
longer, less intense workouts seem easy. A tough 10-minut-
er is the Men’s Health Spartacus Workout. You gals can do it, 
too, by the way! Find it here: www.menshealth.com/mhlists/
high-intensity-circuit-routine/index.php.
You can initiate this workout recipe using the Men’s Health 
smartphone app that I describe elsewhere in this chapter. 
The routine involves 10 exercises, mostly using handheld 
weights or dumbbells, during which you do the reps for 60 
seconds. You perform as many reps as you can for a minute, 
with 15 seconds of rest between sets. Considering that the 
workout involves nine rest periods of 15 seconds before 
the last Spartan exercise (if you make it that far!), the entire 
workout lasts more like 12 minutes 15 seconds.
The exercises include goblet squats (holding a dumbbell 
in your hands while doing the equivalent of air squats), 
mountain climbers, single-arm dumbbell swings, jump-
ing drills, and fancy (read: harder than usual) push-ups. 
This is considered a circuit-training workout, meaning a 
resistance-training session that moves from one exercise to 
another very quickly, testing (and building) your muscular 
strength and cardiovascular fitness.
Like everything else, work up to it using common sense. 
The first time around with the Spartacus Workout, use 
lighter weights and/or slightly longer rest periods. Perhaps 
practice the separate routines involved in the workout 
before you put it all together. This one seems to be tailor-
made for the goal-oriented among us.

The Bench Press
The Bench Press
You probably recall this exercise from high school—I do. The “200-pound 
bench press club,” the stocky dudes who used to hang out in the corner of 
the gym after school. With the bench press, you lie on your back on a bench 
under the bar, with both feet flat on the floor. You place both hands on the 
bar, slightly wider than shoulder width (see Figure 8-2), with your palms fac-
ing outward, or away from you. Move the bar off the rack, let the bar down 
toward your chest (but not all the way, obviously!), and push the bar back 
up, as many reps as you can do. In most cases with the bench press, you will 
have a spotter.
A warm-up that a beginner can do, with a spotter, is to bench press the bar 
as many times as he can. In most gyms, the bar weighs 45 pounds, but check 
with the people who work there first. Another variation on a bench press 
workout, a kind of compound exercise or superset, is to follow the bench 
press with inverted pushups off the bench. You can also do the bench press 
with dumbbells of varying weights, which increases the range of motion used 
for this exercise.
Figure 8-2. The bench press

The Military Press
Chapter 8
214
The Military Press
There are a number of different ways to do the military press (such as begin-
ning with the bar on the floor, or a seated military press), but we’re going to 
show a standing variation of the military press, with the bar placed on a rack 
at about chest height (the equipment is sometimes called a squat rack; it has 
two hooks placed at different heights for racking the bar). Here’s a video link 
showing the general technique for this exercise from Bodybuilder.com: www.
bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/standing-military-press. 
With the military press, you grasp the bar with palms facing outward, care-
fully move it off the rack, then bring the bar down to your chest, and push it 
all the way over your head. Unlike many other exercises, where you do not 
lock the joints such as the elbows or knees, the military press pushes the bar 
in a straight-up-arms position. Figure 8-3 shows the beginning of the rep 
before the big push.
The military press can also use dumbbells, such as in a seated position, as 
shown in Figure 8-4. This exercise is also called the shoulder press.

The Deadlift
The Deadlift
For the deadlift, the barbell starts on the floor, or you can take the bar off 
the rack while standing. You crouch down with your legs bent, and grasp the 
bar at about shoulder width with your palms down (but there are variations 
on the grip), shins almost touching the bar. A common instruction for the 
deadlift is to “drive through your heels” as you pick up the bar, pushing your 
hips toward the bar at the end of the movement. An excellent demo video 
from Bodybuilding.com is here: www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/
name/barbell-deadlift. 
You should watch this video before you perform the exercise, because you 
can hurt your back doing the deadlift if it is not executed correctly. Begin 
with lower weights first as you grow accustomed to the movement. Figure 8-5 
shows the finish of the deadlift.
Figure 8-5. Completing the deadlift

The Leg Press
Chapter 8
216
The Leg Press
The leg press is designed to strengthen the big upper-leg muscles. It is a very 
effective strengthener for the glutes (your fanny muscles), the hamstrings 
(the skeletal muscles along the back of your legs), the quadriceps (your 
thighs), and even your calves. Unlike the other exercises we’ve described 
so far, the leg press, in this variation, involves a machine, not a barbell. It’s a 
pushing exercise, rather than a pulling one like the deadlift. You sit in a seat 
and place both of your feet on a plate or platform about shoulder width 
apart, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Figure 8-6. The leg press
As with many machines, it’s a good idea to use the leg press with low weight 
the first time around, focusing on a smooth, slow motion and proper tech-
nique (inhale when the weight comes back toward you; exhale when you 
push). Do not lock your knee joints during this exercise; keep your legs 
slightly bent at the end of your push motion. Keep your feet flat on the 
plate. (A variation of this technique uses only one leg, with comparatively 
light weights, in order to help strengthen the weaker leg when you have a 
strength imbalance between your two limbs.) 
This is a good conditioning exercise for jumping, sprinting, skiing, and other 
sports. Here’s an excellent demonstration video from Bodybuilding.com: 
www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/leg-press.

The Back Squat
The Back Squat
The back squat is another strengthening exercise for your upper leg muscles: 
the quads and the hamstrings. The bar touches your shoulders behind your 
head, as shown in Figure 8-7. You place the bar on your back by “stepping 
into it,” when the bar is already positioned with its weights on a squat rack, 
which is a tool that most gyms will have in their resistance-training areas. 
The rack allows you to position the bar at different heights. This prevents you 
from straining yourself trying to get the bar off the floor and onto your back. 
Figure 8-7. The back squat: tried-and-true, but watch the lower back
When you’re finished with a set, you can just step toward the rack again (not 
that you’re very far away from it in the first place!) and place the bar on the 
two hooks that are about at your shoulder height. You should probably use a 
barbell pad as well, as the bar can create some discomfort on the shoulders. 
Practice with a wooden staff or a bar alone with no weight before you 
begin a back squat (or any type of squat) with weighted plates on the bar. 
You have to be careful with this technique, because the improper usage 
of it can potentially hurt your knees or lower back (that’s why I prefer the 
leg press for a challenging thigh exercise—there’s less of a risk of back 
injury). The following video provides a demonstration: www.youtube.com/
watch?v=Hyjpz4jkjSQ.

The Back Squat
Chapter 8
218
Figure 8-8 shows a front squat, which is another variation. Figure 8-9 shows a 
power squat, which is a machine that, in my personal experience, allows you 
to safely use much more weight than a back squat, without putting poten-
tially excessive pressure on your lower back, for example.
Since it doesn’t involve free weights, the power squat can safely substitute 
for free-weight squats, if you’re not quite ready for those.

Dumbbells
Dumbbells
You can use dumbbells to initiate both squats and deadlifts. This is fine; one 
technique isn’t necessarily better than the other, and you’re still working 
hard. For squats, hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, then 
perform the squat as you would with a bar. For deadlifts, carefully move a 
couple of dumbbells to the floor next to your feet: one to your left, one to 
your right. Bend down and pick them up, drive through your heels and stand 
straight, as shown in Figure 8-10.

Bicep Curls and Hammer Curls
Chapter 8
220
Bicep Curls and Hammer Curls
Bicep curls and hammer curls are two exercises you can do with dumbbells 
that strengthen your upper arms. The latter are for triceps and the former for 
biceps muscles. You can do curls standing up or sitting down, but I’ve found 
that when standing up, the routine requires more effort (we’re not trying to 
make these workouts easier!). 
For hammer curls, for the triceps or the back of the upper arm, the dumb-
bells are parallel to your body and the grip used is similar to a handshake, as 
shown in Figure 8-11. This exercise can be combined in a compound set with 
bicep curls for a complete arm-strengthening exercise. 
Figure 8-12 shows the well-known bicep curl with dumbbells. This uses a 
palms-up grip, similar to a chin-up. One option for your routine is to perform 
a set of hammer curls, take a short rest or do an upper-body set of another 
exercise, then complete the troika with a set of bicep curls. Rinse and repeat. 
Bicep curls and hammer curls focus on fairly small muscle groups of the arm, 
so make sure you’re not spending too much time on them at the expense of 
hitting the big muscle groups with your weight training—the hamstrings, 
quads (thigh muscles), glutes (butt muscles), and lower, middle, and upper 
back, as well as the trapezoid or shoulder muscles.

different grip than bicep curls

Leg Extensions and Cable Pulldowns
Leg Extensions and Cable Pulldowns
The leg extension machine is a machine that you sit down in for exercising 
the quadriceps muscles. Leg extensions can be performed with either one 
or both legs (the one-legged exercise to help correct a strength imbalance 
between the two legs, for example). Use only light to moderate weight at 
the beginning for this exercise, because you could otherwise hurt your knee 
joints. I use leg extensions, mostly of the one-legged variety, as a comple-
mentary routine following more effective lower-body techniques, such as 
the leg press or back or power squat. Figure 8-13 shows a leg extension 
machine.
Figure 8-13. The leg extension machine for the quads
The cable pulldown is an excellent exercise for the upper back (traps) and 
arms (seemingly more of an exercise for the triceps, in terms of the arm). 
There are numerous variations of this exercise, both standing and sitting, as 
well as with wide or narrow grips. The one I have chosen to show in Figure 8-14 
involves sitting down at a cable machine, using a narrow grip, and pulling 
down on a weighted stack.

This brief introduction is sufficient, to say the least, to get you started on 
an all-body resistance-training regimen at the gym. There are nevertheless 
hundreds of exercises that can be performed with free weights and barbells, 
machines, dumbbells, kettlebells, weighted balls—you name it. To come 
right down to it, you don’t need the endless flood of “new and improved” 
fitness tools, wherein it is difficult to separate slick marketing from an actual 
tool or device that has a practical, beneficial effect. You can add strength 
and lean mass with a small, well-defined set of free weights and machines, 
for instance.
Figuring out Progression in Weight Training
When you’re lifting weights, how do you know by how 
much to increase the weight when you are progressing to a 
higher level of resistance? 
This is another “art versus science” issue. An experienced 
weightlifter knows when a particular weight, say with the 
bench press, is getting too easy: you obviously can do multiple 
repetitions with the weight with a lower level of exertion. 
We recommended 10RM (10 repetition maximum) as a 
pretty good level of resistance to use for one set of repeti-
tions. This is the highest weight that you can do 10 repeti-
tions of. For example, if you’re performing the leg exten-
sion, and by the 10th rep your thighs are really burning to 
the point where you cannot wait to let the weight down 
and conclude the set, then you have probably used a 10RM 
weight for that exercise. If it seems really easy (you have 
plenty of reps still in your legs), you need to increase the 
weight, up to your “true 10RM.”
The excellent book Essentials of Strength Training and 
Conditioning offers a few rules of thumb that you can use 
for increasing the weight: when you can do two more reps 
than usual (say, 12 reps) for an exercise, during two con-
secutive sessions, try increasing the weight. For beginning 
weightlifters, increase it by 2.5 to 5 pounds (or about twice 
that for lower-body exercises). For the experienced, add 5 
to 10 pounds additional weight (10 to 15 pounds for lower 
body). Or, use your best judgment and increase the weight 
by anywhere from 2.5 percent to 10 percent of the current 
weight.7
You can add strength  
and lean mass with a small, 
well-defined set of free weights 
and machines.

Using an App, or Not, to Record Sets
Instructional Video Sources
It helps to watch technique-oriented videos before you start a new resis-
tance-training routine. The Mayo Clinic website has an extensive collection 
of “how-to” videos: www.mayoclinic.com/health/strength-training/MY00033. 
They are mostly designed for beginners and include coverage of machines, 
free weights, and body-weight exercises.
Bodybuilding.com also has a huge library of instructional videos and other 
resources: www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/. If that’s not enough, a Google 
search on “resistance training videos,” for example, produces more than 10 
million hits.
The next section describes a couple of apps that you can use to track your 
sets and reps. Then we conclude the chapter with a segment that introduces 
CrossFit, a variation on the local gym that you might be interested in trying 
out at some point. CrossFit offers a few useful routines that you cannot find 
at a typical fitness facility, like climbing ropes!
Using an App, or Not, to Record Sets
Remember that “what gets measured gets managed” paradigm we men-
tioned in the preface—the measure first mantra? It’s often a good idea to 
keep track of your sets and reps over time, as well as the subjective aspects 
of weightlifting (e.g., “I was maxed out by that last set, even though last week 
I got through it no problem.”). The data is not only motivational, but it shows 
you what you’re doing right, what you’re doing wrong, when you need to 
rest, and what type of rest works best. 
Consider recording sets, reps, and the weight used for various exer-
cises, as well as the effect of sleep and nutrition on your energy levels. 
The purpose of resistance training is to increase muscular strength by gradu-
ally increasing the resistance or weight you are lifting. This action stimulates 
the muscles and other physical systems to adapt to an ever-increasing load 
or level of weight. If you want to be scientific about your weightlifting, it can 
be difficult to remember the weight that you used for various exercises, and 
thus to manage the sequential incrementing of that weight as you develop 
strength, if you don’t keep records. 
Traditionally, people bring lists they’ve written down or printed out of their 
exercises, sets, reps, and weight used, as well as their goals for the day or 
session. It’s a tried-and-true method, and it might be useful if you have a 
particularly complicated session planned for that day—say, half a dozen or 
more exercises. Or, you may be able to keep your set-and-rep scheme in your 
head. Either “low-tech” option works fine; I don’t use any recording apps for 
my typically short and efficient workouts.

If something more high-tech appeals, though, you can use a smartphone 
app to set up and record your weightlifting, and there are some good ones 
out there.
Men’s Health Workouts
Men’s Health Workouts is a comprehensive app (for both Android and the 
iPhone) that includes numerous recipes and descriptions of resistance-
training techniques, as well as methods for recording them. Before you get 
into the description of this app, be advised that it is not designed to record 
exercise routines you have invented. You have to perform the Men’s Health 
routines (there are dozens to choose from), and it provides you with a fea-
ture to save the sets and reps. This app also does not have a web-connected 
dashboard and graphics, at least at the time I checked it out, for viewing 
your workouts.
Figure 8-15 shows the main screen, which gives you the choice between 
exercise descriptions, workout recipes, and logging (inputting reps and sets).
Figure 8-15. Get some good ideas for workouts from the Men’s Health Workouts app for 
smartphones
Choose Workouts and Build New Muscle from the resulting screen, and 
you get a little description of the recommended program. Specifically, this 
routine involves four weeks of training using eight exercises, of the “3 sets, 
8 to 10 reps” variety. The routines are of the “do this, do that” prescriptive 
variety, but you can obviously adapt them to your own program. Perhaps 
run through the whole routine once to determine if you want to adopt parts 
of it or the whole thing. The app does a pretty good job of briefly describing 
and illustrating the exercises, as shown in Figure 8-16.

be inconvenient and awkward to carry around a smartphone (thus all the

the weight room than others. When it’s time to log the workout, select “Add

The big missing element—the elephant in the room, so to speak—is the 
absence of an accompanying website with all your workout data uploaded 
and displayed with charts and graphics. 
We described Fitocracy in Chapter 2. If you’re a Fitocracy member, you 
can use its mobile site (not a smartphone app, as of this writing) to record 
weight-training sessions. Go to the site at www.fitocracy.com/m/play/. The 
sets will be saved and added to your data at the website, on the cloud, so 
to speak. 
This site has an intuitive design for entering weightlifting data. Given that 
your own data is stored on Fitocracy’s servers (for viewing/manipulating 
once you log onto the site), the data is accessible on your phone via the 
mobile app. Figure 8-18 shows a screen for logging a set.

CrossFit
We include an introduction to CrossFit here, but not because it is one of the 
loudest recent buzzwords of the exercise world (although that noise may well 
lead you to wonder, “What is CrossFit?”). As a cross-training regimen, it seems to 
be a very good fit with the other regimens we covered in Chapter 7 and earlier 
in this chapter, such as sprinting, body-weight exercises, and weightlifting. 
CrossFit involves all of these activities, and more. We’ll let the developers 
speak for themselves, from the introductory page at: www.crossfit.com/cf-
info/what-crossfit.html: 
CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for 
many police academies and tactical operations teams, military 
special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds 
of other elite and professional athletes worldwide. Our program 
delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. 
Our specialty is not specializing. Combat, survival, many sports, and 
life reward this kind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist.
We’ll talk about CrossFit again in Chapter 9, when we discuss using a 
WOD (or workout of the day) generator. The CrossFit gang also pay 
more than lip service to additional health-related aspects such as 
nutrition and fasting, which are widely discussed in this book.
Cross-training
CrossFit might be thought of as cross-training on steroids. Cross-training is 
the traditional term for using exercises that promote variety and focus on 
both cardiovascular strength and power, for example, combining running, 
sprinting, and weightlifting. Cross-training was an outgrowth of people 
finally burning out on “just running” or “just cycling,” as well as the prolifera-
tion of extensive year-round training programs for one team sport (promot-
ing more burnout), leading many to realize that they needed some variety 
throughout the year.
CrossFit is basically offered at gyms that are specially designed for those 
purposes, and you can find them in the Yellow Pages and advertised on the 
Web. They have introductory courses on the huge variety of techniques they 
use, and the Web also offers a ton of descriptions and videos. Just go to the 
CrossFit Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ page), for instance, at www.cross-
fit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0.
The list of CrossFit videos is here: www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercise.
html. 
CrossFit involves a smorgasbord of weightlifting, gymnastics, body-weight 
exercises (all kinds of pushups), newish techniques (such as hoisting kettle-
bells around), and the kind of climbing maneuvers you might see at a 

Using an App, or Not, to Record Sets

military boot camp or “muddy gladiator”–type weekend race, like climbing 
ropes. The CrossFitters pride themselves on being all-rounders and “func-
tional,” meaning their techniques are meant to make you strong in a practical 
way, instead of just making a particular muscle group bulge out or giving 
you six-pack abs.
The six-pack ab mentality is so pervasive that my 7-year-old blurted 
out one day that he “only had a two-pack.”
With CrossFit, you can work out alone or in a class full of sweaty people 
doing mountain climbers and hoisting barbells, which a lot of people appar-
ently like to do. Class-style fitness has never appealed to me, but I suppose 
that depends on your personality and experience. I’ve found that some 
CrossFit facilities are particularly rigorous about making you take classes 
and/or move about the facility with an instructor, so you may have to shop 
around if that’s not your style.
With all the information available on the Web you are certainly capable of 
buying the equipment or just using your local gym to initiate your own 
CrossFit routine. CrossFit proponents often recommend that you learn the 
different techniques, then use the various WOD generators. 
CrossFit also has competitive tournaments, and the various techniques 
involved in the competitions are a reflection of just how versatile and 
strenuous CrossFit can be. The tournament might require its entrants to do 
as many pull-ups as they can, run a 5k, run a 400-meter dash, squat as much 
weight as they can, do a timed weightlifting contest for total volume, and so 
on. Just looking at the results will knock you out. It is the Everyman’s Olympic 
decathlon.

Consider an imaginary world where your job is to move the cream puffs 
off the assembly line. I seem to dimly recall an I Love Lucy episode along 
those lines. Anyways, the crux of your tasks could be reduced to “cream 
puff… cream puff… cream puff.” What do you think your brain would be 
like at the end of the week, or the month, without any other stimulation? 
You might be wearing one of those T-shirts that reads “My brain on cream 
puffs.” Do you think your brain would grow and thrive? Obviously not—our 
nervous systems and neural networks need constant stimulation of a vary-
ing nature to sustain themselves and grow more robust. A little math here, 
some programming, a new language; finally, you get to a complete reading 
of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. 
The brain needs to be surprised and challenged, along the lines of a 
Lumosity test.
You can access this “exercise your brain” online site at www.lumosity.

Shock the Monkey
Your body and physique require constant shocks and challenges, too, in the 
form of surprises and new techniques to learn. The idea that surprising your 
body with good stress, as in a hard and/or explosive movement that you’re 
not accustomed to, has gained a lot of traction lately in the fitness world. Art 
De Vany, an impressively fit economist in his seventies, the “grandfather 
of Paleo,” and one of the first to apply Chaos Theory to health and 
fitness, is a big proponent of shocking or surprising your own 
metabolism with a fast (the no-food kind) or a high-intensity 
workout. The idea is that we seem to benefit from brief, acute 
stresses that excite adaptive processes and help make us stronger. 
We’re designed for variety and the adaptation of our phy-
siques to multiple skills.

Shake It Up in the Morning
Imagine that when you wake up in the morning you know you’re going to 
do some kind of exercise, but you don’t know exactly what it will be. It will be 
randomly chosen for you. Randomizing exercise is one of the new frontiers 
of fitness you can explore. 
We’re talking about exercise within certain parameters, not injury-
prone surprises, such as, “This morning you’ll pull a truck up the drive-
way with a cable and your teeth.”
We’re going to start off this chapter with a discussion of randomness and 
variability in the workout realm, and tools you can use to take part in that. 
These include the new website GAIN Fitness, and a random CrossFit-workout 
picker called The WOD Shop.
I’m Only Sleeping
The rest of the chapter covers sleep, rest, and sleep/rest tools mixed togeth-
er. Why bother to even write about sleep or to use sleep analysis tools? 
Sleep is a deeply underappreciated aspect of fitness and health, particularly 
among geeks. Most geeks would rather write code and hack and eat pizza 
than sleep at night, whereas if they want to gain fitness and stay healthy, the 
inverse would be better: writing code and hacking standing up during the 
day, and taking naps and sleeping at night. 
A friend of mine summed up the state of sleep among modern techies when 
he said, “Society shouldn’t call it ‘sleep’—it should be renamed along the 
lines of ‘human cell-rejuvenation time’ or the like.” We usually view sleep as 
optional, and something kind of cool to skip. We like to be up when others 
are snoozing, as if we are going to experience some intriguing life revelation 
that others will not, such as watching intoxicated people say awful things 
and do face-plants in front of nightclubs.
Better to get a good night’s sleep so you can wake up refreshed and have 
a gratifying, perhaps randomly assigned bit of exercise under the sun. We’ll 
check out some apps for analyzing the quality of sleep, such as the Zeo sleep 
manager tool.
Sleep is a deeply  
underappreciated aspect  
of fitness and health,

RESTful Programmers
We’re also going to discuss the importance of rest for athletes, as in tak-
ing days off from the fun stress your body undergoes. You need the rest to 
rebuild and recharge. People tend to not rest enough, particularly when 
they get excited about a new routine, start seeing some results, or compete 
in the endurance world. Exercise can also be physically addictive, as in some-
thing you crave each day. 
Overtraining, at least amongst sports-medicine geeks, is considered a 
kind of disease, complete with a set of physical and mental symptoms, 
like a racing heart rate, irritability, and not sleeping well.
Two concepts—“less is more,” along with another old expression that is still 
useful to us fitness geeks, “quality not quantity”—are important for staying 
rested, strong, and infection-free.
We’re going to discuss an interesting tool called RestWise that serious ath-
letes and daily fitness hackers alike can use to analyze their current state or 
level of rest.

Ever programmed a random() function in your code? The typical setup is to 
have an array of items that the program has to display or use, but it doesn’t 
matter which item the code plucks out of the array. I did a JavaScript pro-
gram that had to display a book cover whenever a web page was displayed 
in the browser, but not the same book cover every time. I had an array of 
“book image” objects representing the different book covers, and when the 
page was loaded, the JavaScript shuffled the array and chose the first mem-
ber to display. Parts of the code are shown below:
var bookCoverJava = new BookImage(…); 
var bookCoverGWT = new BookImage(…); 
var bookCoverAjax = new BookImage(…); 
var imgArray = new Array(bookCoverJava, bookCoverGWT, bookCoverAjax); 
// randomly shuffle the book covers using a custom function 
imgArray.shuffle(); 
//choose the book cover to display 
var bookObject = imgArray[0];
What if you could choose your exercise workout this way? Well, you can. You 
can create your own array of workout objects, shuffle them up, and write 
a program that chooses one for you each morning. That would be fun, but 
labor-intensive. Also, you would be writing the workout routines, so a certain 
amount of bias would be baked into the workouts. You wouldn’t truly be 
surprised or shocked by the routines, since you would be making them up.

The WOD Shop
We don’t always have to reinvent the wheel. At least one site will do this 
for you. The WOD Shop is a website that lets you choose from a category of 
workout types (e.g., weightlifting, endurance, body weight, or kettlebells), 
and it will generate a workout for you. You can access it at www.wodshop.org. 
In CrossFit circles (see Chapter 8) a WOD means “workout of the day”; how-
ever, for our purposes, it could also mean “workout on demand.” Figure 9-1 
shows what The WOD Shop’s menu page looks like.

You are presented with the choices of Weightlifting, Endurance, Bodyweight,

Figure 9-2 shows the result: a tough series of different forms of pushups, 
squats, and other exercises, like “mountain climbers” (see Chapter 8 for more 
details on some of these CrossFit variations).
Figure 9-2. Spartan push-ups, Hindu push-ups, Spidermans, and more
This workout specifies: 
• 1 round (so you only do this once)
• 15x Spiderman push-ups
• 10x squats
• 15x mountain climbers
• 10x squats
• 15x Spartan push-ups
• 10x squats
• 15x Hindu push-ups
• 10x squats
• 15x dips
Chapter 8 describes some of these different types of exercises. You shouldn’t 
use any weight on your back for the squats (it’s not specified). They’re more 
like “air squats.” A Spartan pushup, for example, is a normal pushup, except 
that your hand positions are staggered; one is in a normal position while the 
other is behind that position, closer to your chest. With each pushup, you 
exchange the hand positions.

The whole workout should take about 10 minutes (believe me, it’s a very effi-
cient and intense 10 minutes!), unless you take longer rests in between sets.
You could do this workout anywhere: in a hotel room, your mother-in-law’s 
living room, or, if you were really brazen, an airport terminal lounge. You 
can also adapt the workout to your own body and needs; you don’t have to 
perform it exactly as specified (for example, you’d probably have to practice 
Spartan pushups and do fewer reps). 
You can also access this site from your mobile phone at www.wodshop.org/
mobile/index.html. Figure 9-3 shows a dynamically generated weightlifting 
workout on my mobile phone. 
Figure 9-3. Five sets of three “power cleans” from the mobile phone at WOD generator 
These instructions mean two upper-body barbell exercises (power clean and 
pushup press), five sets of three reps, at about 70 percent of “one rep max” 
(1RM). What’s 1RM? This is a relative way to gauge how much each individual 
lifts for a certain exercise. One RM is the most weight you can do for one rep-
etition with a specific exercise, such as 150 pounds for the bench press. So, 
70 percent of 1RM for this bench press would be about 105 pounds.

See Chapter 8 for more details on repetition maximums and weightlifting 
in the gym. 
It can be hazardous to try to find out an unknown 1RM for a certain 
exercise. You can try to estimate your 1RM by how many reps you’ve 
done with a lighter weight. A number of equations have been pro-
posed to calculate a maximum load lifted—a 1RM—from performing 
the same exercise with less weight on the bar. Here’s one: 1RM = ((# of 
reps) / 30 + 1) x weight. So, if you bench pressed 145 pounds 10 times 
(and that was all you could do), the equation would be (10/30 + 1) 
x 145 = 193. This equation suggests that you could bench press 193 
pounds once.
GAIN Fitness
Another workout generator I like comes via GAIN Fitness at http://gainfit-
ness.com. It was in an alpha stage at the time I was using it in early winter 
2011/12. To build a “quick workout,” as GAIN Fitness describes it, you use the 
screen shown in Figure 9-4. I like the various “tuning options” you’re given 
for determining a workout that includes equipment like kettlebells and bar-
bells, or not.

You can even configure the number of minutes that you want to devote to 
the exercise, and set the gender, level of fitness experience, and which part 
of the body you want to focus on. Then you just click the Build Workout  
button. 
The results are quite impressive and intuitive. The app displays a series of 
exercises with videos (for some of them) and descriptions, as well as a timer 
and some stats to start with (such as how long it should take you and the 
total number of reps). Figure 9-5 shows the top segment of the results. I liked 
the ability to choose a menu item for a text description or a video.

The tool also will also generate a fitness plan or routine for you, although this 
doesn’t have anything to do with randomizing fitness. You might just get 
some more good ideas for additional fitness or strength-building methods. 
Figure 9-6 shows the different components you can configure for the plan, 
such as muscle groups targeted, whether you’re in gym or home settings, 
the time devoted to each workout, how many days per week you want to 
train, and so on.
Figure 9-6. Use a GAIN Fitness template for an autogenerated fitness plan or

Once you generate the plan, the tool displays a calendar view, as Figure 9-7 
shows. This view rotates through a couple of routines that are similar to the 
ones that can be dynamically generated for you in the quick workouts mode. 
For example, you do one kind of workout on Monday, a different one for 
Thursday, and the tool configures the routines for you.

The important thing is to find a tool to make up the “surprise” workouts for 
you. Otherwise, you’ll fall prey to the tendency to hit your comfort zone with 
the same set of static exercises that you’ve done for months, a sure prescrip-

who needs a personal trainer? 
If you like to work out with other people, get together with friends and 
randomize, then treat yourself to a pizza (but with Paleo crust and plenty of 
veggies for a topping!).
Mashing Up Your Sports Devices
One of the ways you can add variety to your routine, and to make sure all 
your fitness databases (such as Endomondo, the Fitbit Tracker, and Garmin 
Connect) are up to date with your latest workouts, is to mash up the various 
devices and tools you use. All of these tools include internal databases that 
store your workouts historically. If you go from one device to another—from 
a Garmin device to a smartphone, for instance—various databases will get 
out of sync with your training and exercise data. Horrors!

You could bring two devices along—a watch and a smartphone, for exam-
ple—to determine if there are significant differences in the way they collect 
data. How close are the mileage calculators, and which device has the most 
accurate GPS? Thankfully, the devices do tend to play well with each other 
in terms of being able to export GPX files that can be imported into another 
tracker’s database. 
GPS can be notoriously imprecise in terms of measuring up to the 
tenth of a mile. Different devices tend to disagree with each other in 
measuring the exact length of runs, for instance. This drives runners 
crazy. Most of the time, however, the GPS-enabled devices serve our 
purposes fine.
During this interlude, we’re going to take a look at combining Garmin with 
Endomondo. My Forerunner 301, an older GPS-enabled watch that records 
workouts, provided the data for Garmin. As described in Chapter 2, the 
watch plugs into the USB port of your computer, then uploads its data to 
Garmin Connect, a nifty web-based dashboard sporting all kinds of features. 
It’s located at http://connect.garmin.com.
The Endomondo smartphone app, another GPS device that connects with 
an elaborate training website, is discussed at length in Chapters 2 and 7.
Figure 9-8 shows the Garmin Connect window displaying various features of 
a mountain-bike ride.

One of the nice features of Garmin Connect is that it includes a Player (an 
embedded Adobe Flash program) that allows you to replay the entire work-
out and check out the sequential data along the way, such as your speed and 
elevation. Nifty! Figure 9-9 shows the Player in a Garmin Connect window. 
Figure 9-9. Replay your workout using Garmin Connect’s Player
But I digress; let’s return to mashing up the devices’ associated databases.
This workout was recorded on my Garmin watch, but we want to include 
the training in Endomondo’s database as well. Never fear. There are at least 
two ways to accomplish this task. One is to go to www.endomondo.com/
workouts/ with the Garmin device plugged into your USB port, then choose 
the Import Workout button. 
This feature displays a window that gives you a choice of importing the 
workout from a file or from a Garmin device. As long as you have installed 
the Garmin Communicator browser plug-in (which you have if you have 
been playing with one of Garmin’s GPS devices), Endomondo will pull all 
of your workouts off the device and give you the choice of which ones to 
include in its database.

You can also export a file from Garmin Connect, then import the same file 
into Endomondo. This is easy to do. In the activities segment of your Garmin 
dashboard in the browser, select an activity or workout. The selection will 
bring you to a detailed page on that activity. This page has an Export but-
ton, which allows you to generate a GPX file, for example, representing that 
activity.
Save that file on your computer. Then, once again, go to www.endomondo.
com/workouts/ and choose Import Workout. This time, select the file you 
downloaded to your computer. Figure 9-10 shows the same mountain-bike 
ride at Endomondo, so now you’ve synced your databases at both sites.

Rest and Taper

Rest and Taper
Resting is the part of fitness that few people are particularly good at. Just 
about all of us are good at being a couch potato, but not working out at all 
during the day? “Gotta get my fix!”
Tapering is also an important concept for people who like to do races. 
Tapering means gradually cutting back during the days and weeks lead-
ing up to a race or competition—in a way, like taking an “active holiday.” 
Tapering is almost more art than science. You have to listen to your body, 
and that goes for resting as well.
Exercise is addictive, and it’s hard to know intuitively how much rest is 
neither too little nor too much. But rest assured (no pun intended), you will 
fail to get stronger with either resistance or endurance training if you don’t rest 
enough. 
In fact, the idea of “less is more” is becoming more popular in exercise 
circles, even among Ironman triathletes, who’ve probably by tradition (and 
in response to the brutal distances they have to train for) been guilty of the 
most overtraining. 
Decelerate, Strategically
Most fitness regimens are based on the concept of overload, or taxing your 
physical system with an intense but manageable stress, then cutting back, or 
completely stopping any hard exercise (short of a walk), to allow your body 
and mind to recover and initiate the adaptations that will make you stronger. 
As you can probably imagine, you could fill books—and authors have—with 
the varying strategies for how to spread exercise and rest periods through-
out a week or month. Runners and triathletes have their periodization plans 
for an entire season, dictating when their training will peak, ebb, and flow 
leading up to their events, with complicated calendars and designated rest 
days. Traditionally, these athletes use Sunday as a rest day, but they’re usu-
ally doing something out at the gym or on the road on all of the other days.
Tapering means gradually  
cutting back during the days 
and weeks leading up to a 
race or competition, in a way, 
like taking an ‘active holiday.’

The Wound Healing School
CrossFitters also tend to have a schedule that keeps them working out 
hard four, five, or six days out of the week (see Chapter 8 for the skinny on 
CrossFit). On the other hand, the popular high-intensity training (HIT) school 
of weightlifting recommends training very hard just once every 7 or 10 days, 
for example. 
This “wound healing” school of iron pumpers bases its strategy on the notion 
that it takes a week or more to heal from a very hard weight-training session 
and to rebuild the targeted muscles, and it has good physiological evidence 
to back it up.
It’s essential to introduce variety into your routine, and this built-in variabil-
ity usually includes rest as a side effect. For example, you might work out 
really hard with weights or a CrossFit routine once per week, and let walks, 
romps in the park with dogs and/or kids, and bike commutes take care of 
your remaining desire and need to get outdoors. You have to see what works 
for you; everyone is different.
I devised my own strategy in the old days for preparing and tapering 
for races, like a 10k or a triathlon. About 7–10 days out I would do a 
short, intense race (such as a 5k) as a “tune-up,” and then I’d cut back 
my daily training significantly, by about half. Every other day I would 
take a complete day off, especially the day before a race. I focused 
on getting good sleeps every night. About 48 hours out I would get 
a sports massage (see Chapter 10). This usually worked for me; I was 
almost always very fresh for races.
As you may have predicted, there’s a software tool (at least one!) for gauging 
your rest levels and patterns.
RestWise
RestWise is an online tool for calculating the restfulness levels of athletes. Its 
literature describes the tool as a “non-invasive fatigue monitoring system” 
(meaning, needles aren’t involved). It’s basically a way to “hack your rest lev-
els.” RestWise is designed for pro or amateur superstars, their coaches, and 
regular Janes and Joes like you and me. While it’s a for-pay service, you can 
try it out for free for two weeks at restwise.com. 
Resting is the part of fitness 
that few people are particularly 
good at.

The way it works is that you sign in at the website, then go to the page 
for submitting your physical or biological data (nothing too complicated). 
Figure 9-11 shows this page. You enter values for several parameters, includ-
ing resting heart rate, oxygen saturation (more on that in a moment), your 
weight, the hours you slept, as well as several subjective categories, such as 
your mood, energy level, and whether you have muscle soreness. You even 
enter an estimate on a sliding color scale of your pee color, as this is a very 
good barometer of your level of dehydration (really yellow is bad; clear is 
good). 
Figure 9-11. Entering the various subjective and objective biological stuff at RestWise
Oxygen saturation is a measure of how well oxygen is being diffused 
throughout your body. If you’ve ever been in a hospital intensive care unit 
(ICU), they are always sticking this device that looks like a clothespin on the 
patient’s finger. This is measuring the oxygen saturation. For healthy values, 
they look for a result in the high 90s, such as between 96 and 99. 
A pulse oximeter is the hardware tool that comes with the RestWise software 
service (and it looks like a fancy electronic clothespin): you use this device 
as you are entering data. It captures both your resting heart rate (how many 
times your heart beats per minute) and your oxygen saturation.

Once you enter the data, you click a button for the results, which Figure 9-12 
shows.
Figure 9-12. Checking out your recovery score with RestWise
The results give you a “recovery score” of up to 100 percent, which means “all 
systems go,” and you’re ready to train again. If you get a lower percent value 
in the red zone, that means take it easy on training today, or take the day 
off. You can email the resulting chart and download it in comma-separated-
value (CSV) format (for Excel and other applications).
The FAQ at the site (restwise.com/contactus/askus/) discusses the proprietary 
algorithm it uses to produce recovery scores, without completely letting the 
cat out of the bag. Here’s the answer to the question about whether all the 
values you enter are weighted the same (they’re not):
The weighting varies for each marker and is dependent on the 
strength of the empirical and anecdotal evidence of each. Keep in 
mind also that the algorithm is specific to the individual by intel-
ligently referencing to an individual’s baseline data and also intel-
ligently responding to the degree by which specific markers change 
over a few days; for example, the weight of last night’s sleep score (a 
proprietary algorithm for duration and quality) is dependent on the 
previous two night’s scores, with the understanding that the effect 
of poor sleep is cumulative.

The All-Important Zees
Chapter 9
248
It also points out that the recovery scores will probably be low if you are in 
an overload or supercompensation mode of training (in which you have actu-
ally stressed or broken the body on purpose). If you’re just day-to-day train-
ing for health, however, only the complete cessation of training will help you 
recover. You just have to take days off sometimes.
The All-Important Zees
Maybe we’re all wrong about nutrition and exercise as the primary touch-
stones of fitness. What if fitness chiefly revolved around how well you slept 
and handled stress, and that food and muscle-work represented the icing 
on the cake and were comparatively incidental to sleeping well and putting 
life’s stressful interludes into perspective? 
In my own experience, sleep seems to be at the top of my agenda just when 
it is least attainable. With few exceptions, I feel awful without it—the bottom 
line for me is, sleep is wicked important!
And it should be for you, too (see the “Melatonin: The Darkness Hormone” 
sidebar). Medical researchers have associated long-term sleep deprivation 
with all kinds of serious medical issues,2 as well as inflammation in general.3 
Enough said on the dark side of going withovut sleep; let’s discuss the ben-
efits, basics, and tracking considerations of getting a good conk-out.
This chunk of the chapter covers some of the basics of sleeping, followed by 
a rundown of a few tools and apps you can use to monitor and track your 
entrance into the luxurious realm of dozing—hacking your sleep, in other 
words, with a tool called Zeo or the Fitbit.
We also discuss an app that helps with meditation, which is a tool you might 
consider including in your own stress-reducing repertoire.
Sleep Basics
Most of us require anywhere from seven and a half to nine hours of sleep 
per night. Sleep is essential for the repair and growth of cells, and it’s a cru-
cial stage of the circadian rhythm or “biological clock” by which your body 
times and controls its various physiological states. For example, when life 
intercedes and whacks out our normal sleep patterns, the timing for the 
secretion of certain hormones, such as growth hormone, which is used to 
repair and build tissue, and a stress hormone called cortisol, is disrupted. A 
lousy sleep once in a while is natural, but the deprivation isn’t usually a good 
thing over a long time. 
What if fitness chiefly revolved 
around how well you slept and 
handled stress…

The All-Important Zees
It’s just a theory, but sleep studies indicate that proper sleep is essential 
for creating cognitive order out of neural chaos; during sleep’s deepest 
stages, our minds sift through and process the fog of data the daytime has 
immersed us in, filtering out the dross from the information that can be 
committed to memory and learned.4
There’s probably good evidence for this, considering the cognitively 
disorienting effects of just a few bad nights of sleep.
Sleep Stages: NREM and REM
There are two principal stages of sleep that cycle off and on, distinguished 
by brain waves of differing types, throughout the night. Non–rapid eye 
movement (NREM) sleep is composed of four different stages, from “just 
drifting off” to deep, restorative sleep. You spend about 75 percent of sleep-
ing time in NREM sleep.5 The muscles relax, blood pressure and body tem-
perature drop, growth hormone is released, and the repair and restoration 
mechanics of sleep take place. 
You typically traverse each stage of NREM, one through four, before you 
reach the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of deep dreaming. 
The sleep graph produced by the Zeo Sleep Manager indicates that, at 
the very least, the stages can get “mixed up,” so that you may not have 
a latter-stage NREM sleep segment before you drop off into REM. The 
sleep stages are linear, but not strictly linear.
The entire cycle of four-stage NREM to REM is repeated roughly every 90 
minutes; yet, you can experience situations where you undergo hours of 
stage 3 and 4 NREM sleep without falling into REM. Imagine that you’re 
ascending the floors of a building, and each floor is more comprehensive 
and dream-filled.
Befitting the REM stage’s name, the eyes dance around behind the eyelids 
during this cycle, as the theory goes, following the actions and imagery of 
our dreams.6 The first drift into REM lasts only up to 10 minutes, but the dura-
tion of the final REM cycle(s) can be from 20 minutes to more than an hour.7 
It seems that if you have a full eight hours of sleep, you undergo at least 
four or five of these 90–120 minute NREM-to-REM cycles. This is yet further 
evidence that you shouldn’t eschew the various components of a full night’s 
sleep, say, by constantly going to bed too late and getting up too early (if it 
fits your schedule, that is). You could be missing out on one or more of these 
essential REM and NREM components.

The All-Important Zees
Chapter 9
250
Disrupted or habitually deprived sleep will reduce the growth hor-
mone releases that take place during normal NREM cycles—what the 
Zeo tool calls “deep sleep.” At the very least, this state will result in less 
cellular repair and less new tissue growth. If you want to build more 
lean mass or muscle, sleep a lot!
Most dreaming takes place during REM, although you can experience night-
mares and “night terrors” during NREM (it seems that sticking to REM dream-
ing is the way to go!). The brain uses more oxygen during REM sleep than it 
does during normal wakeful activities, belying the myth that everything “just 
shuts down” during sleep.8 
Melatonin: The Darkness Hormone
Melatonin is a hormone or signaling chemical that the 
pineal gland synthesizes and secretes (tryptophan, an 
essential amino acid, is an ingredient for melatonin). The 
pineal gland, a pinecone-shaped gland about the size of a 
pea positioned alongside the brain, is sometimes called the 
“third eye,” because it can convert environmental-lighting 
signals about the time of day and season and send those 
signals to the rest of the body. 
While melatonin makes us sleepy, this hormone lies at the 
center of an intricate biological clock by which our bodies 
synchronize all types of crucial activities. When we expose 
ourselves to bright lights at night, instead of sleeping away 
in our pitch-black man- or girl-caves, we disrupt these 
rhythms to an extent that could make us susceptible to can-
cer, according to an article by David E. Blask, Ph.D., M.D. at 
Tulane University called “Melatonin, Sleep Disturbance, and 
Cancer Risk.” The article appeared in a 2009 issue of Sleep 
Medicine Reviews. Here are some highlights:
• For all but the last 120 years or so, humanity and her 
distant ancestors lived by the solar clock, and there’s 
physiological evidence of this. Sunlight enters the eyes 
and stimulates photoreceptors in the retina—these 
receptors send neural signals to a part of the brain’s 
hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). 
The SCN synchronizes the internal 24-hour rhythms, 
including the melatonin surges at night. Very little 
melatonin is secreted during the day. 
• “The nocturnal melatonin signal provides time of day 
information to all the cells, tissues, and organs of the 
body.” 
• Numerous bodily sites contain melatonin receptors; 
the hormone is involved in no less than “the control of 
sleep, circadian rhythms, retinal physiology, seasonal 
reproductive cycles, cancer development, immune 
activity, antioxidants and free-radical scavenging,” as 
well as mitochondrial respiration, bone metabolism, 
and other processes.
• While sleep deprivation suppresses the immune sys-
tem, a problem in and of itself, it’s the exposure to 
light at night that messes with melatonin messaging. 
If you’re not sleeping, but in darkness, the melatonin 
secretions still continue (one consolation of tossing and 
turning). “Darkness at night is an absolute requirement” 
for melatonin production.
• “It has been postulated that light exposure at night 
may represent a unique risk factor for breast cancer…
via its ability to suppress [melatonin production]…
while male night-shift workers are at a significantly 
increased risk of developing prostate cancer.”
The bottom line? It helps to feel the warmth of the sun on 
your face in the morning, thus sending a natural signal to 
the hypothalamus/SCN and the pineal gland, as well as to 
turn the lights off at night. Try to follow the sun.

What are those twitches you experience just before nodding off to 
sleep? Scientists call them hypnagogic myoclonus, or sleep-related 
muscle spasms. It appears to be just an occasional motor response to 
entering the first stage of NREM sleep. I pumped the term into Google 
Scholar, and one of the results I got was “Exploding head syndrome 
and idiopathic stabbing headache…” so I decided not to explore that

Not everyone wants to know exactly what’s happening while they’re asleep, 
or is comfortable being connected to some device that’s monitoring them at 
night, à la Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange. Others are thrilled or at 
least intrigued by that notion and keen to look at the data afterward (if that’s 
you, see just ahead for a description of the Zeo Sleep Manager).
If you’re looking for clues to inconsistent sleeps, you might find them 
in your own wave patterns, or how NREM or REM stages relate to cer-
tain days, scheduling changes, and what you eat or drink before going 
to bed.
If you don’t want to be hooked up to a monitor, you can track sleep quality 
and quantity with a remarkably simple regimen. For example, for years, all 
I’ve done is recorded my sleep hours in a “fit log” that usually encompasses 
no more than one line of text (sometimes it turns into a kind of pithy diary; 
such as when a child is born, which is nice, considering that it’s more than 
12 years old). 
Record your sleeping hours, including the all-important naps, for a month 
or longer. Compare the data to your resting heart rate and even your blood 
pressure at times. You’ll probably learn that there is a strong relationship 
between sleep and other fitness parameters.
Oddly, sleep quality (or lack thereof) has seldom affected the ability 
of myself and other people to competently get through big athletic or 
physical events (just don’t make them do math!), such as a triathlon, 
or summiting a mountain in the middle of the night. I think there’s evi-
dence that we are capable of tremendous physical achievements on 
little sleep—as certainly required on an evolutionary basis—but we 
can’t count on “the borrowed time” lasting very long.

Hacking Your Sleep with the Zeo Sleep Manager
The Zeo Sleep Manager is one of the power tools that you can use to analyze 
and improve your sleep. Zeo is a combination of hardware and software: a 
clock, a headband with an attached tracking device, an SD card for storing 
your sleep data, and a USB connector for uploading the data. Figure 9-13 
shows the equipment setup, which costs $100 or more depending on the 
options you choose (www.myzeo.com/sleep/). 
Figure 9-13. The Zeo Sleep Manager hardware setup, with headband and USB connector
Zeo also offers a smartphone version that doesn’t require the bedside 
clock; it just has the headband, docking station, and smartphone app.
The way it works is that the headband rests in a cradle that is attached to the 
clock for recharging. When you go to sleep, you wear the headband, which 
connects wirelessly to the clock, recording your sleep data or biofeedback 
on an SD card. The card is easily inserted into and subsequently removed 
from a slot on the side of the clock. The clock does provide a way of turning 
down its glowing luminescence so you don’t violate the darkness of your 
man- or girl-cave. 
The device that Figure 9-13 shows sitting in front of the clock is the USB 
connection to your computer. When you’re ready to upload the sleep data 
or feedback, you remove the SD card and hitch it to this device, which you 
attach to a USB connection, as Figure 9-14 shows. Then you connect with 
Zeo and click Upload Your Sleep Data. This action is similar to uploading the 
data from a Garmin watch to Garmin Connect.

Figure 9-14. Upload your Zeo sleep data with an SD card attached to a USB connection
On a Mac, the USB device is mounted on the desktop and the data is 
stored in a zeo/zeosleep.dat file.
The upload widget at http://mysleep.myzeo.com asks you to choose the zeo-
sleep.dat file. The website software then gobbles up your data and displays 
it with fancy graphics, as shown in Figure 9-15. The chart shows the color-
coded patterns of your sleep stages for the night, if you were lucky enough 
to produce a lot of NREM and REM sleep.

Figure 9-15. The MyZeo charts display the sleep stages with colored patterns denoting REM and NREM sleep
The Zeo FAQs and literature, which are quite extensive on the website, 
define stage 3 and 4 NREM sleep as deep sleep (the dark green bar) and early 
stage NREM as light sleep (the gray-colored bar).
Very nifty. This sleep chart actually represents a good snooze recorded by 
my wife. The lighter green lines on the chart represent REM, a very restor-
ative, dream-filled stage. She chalked up 92 minutes of it, and you can see 
that she had four progressively longer (in general) stages of it, similar to our 
earlier description of the basics of sleep. 
The ochre or orange lines represent times spent awake.
The MyZeo website, which is set up for you after you have registered with 
the serial number from the bedside clock, includes all sorts of structured 
content, blogs, forums, and “hack your sleep” tips that are designed to pol-
ish your snoozing skills. They set up a personalized sleep coach for you, for 
example, and there are graphics that compare your ZQ, or sleep quality, with 
that of other Zeo users of the same age group.

The Zeo Web API
For really hacking your sleep, Zeo offers a Web API with which you or a third 
party can use software code to access your sleep data from Zeo’s servers. 
For example, you might want to display the data in a customized way on 
your own web page, or another personal tracking outfit can integrate Zeo’s 
data with its own features. The API site with documentation is at http://
mysleep.myzeo.com/api/api.shtml.
The Web API works with several different programming languages, includ-
ing Java, PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby. Before you can use the API, you have 
to apply for an authentication key, a long string of hexadecimal numbers, 
which will accompany your programmatic calls for the Zeo sleep informa-
tion. Zeo sends you this key in an email message.

API nitty-gritty
The API documentation is quite complete, but I’ll give you a taste of it here. 
The Zeo Web API uses a RESTful service, meaning that your code can send 
HTTP requests for the sleep data in the form of a URL, such as this example 
from the instructions (you plug in the various components in square brack-
ets): https://api.myzeo.com:8443/zeows/api/[version]/[response_type]/[ser-
vice_name]/[action_name]?key=[key]&[parameters].
A real URL looks like this: https://api.myzeo.com:8443/zeows/api/v1/
sleeperService/getOverallAverageZQScore?key=54CAE7B527B0CD8EA
D5875A20F214CDD.
The version is the software version, as in “v1”; the response type (an optional 
parameter) is “xml” by default (if you leave the parameter out) or “json”; the 
service name is “sleeperService”; and the action name is whatever method or 
action you are calling, as in “getOverallAverageZQScore.” The API documen-
tation provides the details on the different actions you can use.
You can also use the open source OAUTH protocol for authorizing the 
requests for data: see http://oauth.net. 
The key that you receive from Zeo will go right into the URL as the “key” 
parameter. The key is locked to a particular domain (e.g., your website, as in 
www.fitnesskg.com), which you specify when you register with the Zeo Web 
API. This means that you won’t be able to grab real sleep data unless the 
code that executes the Zeo request is hosted on the specified domain. 
I tested these Web API calls by making requests directly from the Firefox 
browser, putting the URL containing all the specified parameters, including 
my key, into the browser location field (even though I didn’t have any data 
on Zeo’s website yet). The response gave me an error message telling me 
that the request did not derive from my specified domain, but at least I was 
able to test using different parameters in the URL, as well as the API’s two 
response types, XML and JSON.
XML and JSON are two structured languages for displaying data.
Here’s the XML version (the key has been changed):
//The URL :: https://api.myzeo.com:8443/zeows/api/v1/sleeperService/

More Web Tracking
Other tools abound for tracking your sleep in more detail with devices and 
gear. You can find a list of self-tracking tools for sleep at Quantified Self: see 
quantifiedself.com/guide/tag/sleep.
For example, the Fitbit Tracker discussed at length in Chapter 2, has a feature 
for these purposes. It includes a whole section on tracking your sleep from 
the night before and over time, as Figure 9-17 shows.
The Fitbit comes with a wristband or armband that you use to take the 
tracker along on your snooze fests. You can wear it on your wrist to record 
your night’s sleep. Figure 9-17 indicates that I was awakened 12 times on this 
night. Ah, reflections of the old days when the kids weren’t sleeping!

Figure 9-17. Use Fitbit to record and examine sleep
Ever hear a comedian say, “I slept like a baby last night—I woke up 
every two hours and cried”?
In this case, every time my hand moved, the Fitbit flagged that as “He’s 
awake,” so there were probably a few times when unconscious rearranging 
of the pillows or yanking the blanket (sorry, spouse) triggered the device. 
Actually, I only remember waking up once during a deep night of snoozing 
on that date. This was otherwise a fairly accurate rendering of what kind of 
sleep I got that night. 
Meditation Tools
Meditation is a useful habit to add to your fitness program. It has the poten-
tial to lower your blood pressure and heart rate, at the very least, and to help 
you dial down the stress and cultivate a sense of peace. If you doubt whether 
the latter mood aspects have health ramifications, you should rethink or 
simply meditate on the topic.

Randomizing Fitness and the Importance of R & R

Meditation Tools
Meditation comes in all shapes and sizes, including transcendental medita-
tion and mindfulness. A Center for Mindfulness, for example, exists at the 
UMass Medical School in Massachusetts, and the technique is used exten-
sively to help people with the stress induced by chronic illnesses. 
Mindfulness is based on the notion that you can “live in the moment” while 
meditating and simply let thoughts flow in and out of your consciousness 
unheeded, without being preoccupied by their meanings or responding 
stressfully to them. One mindfulness expert used the metaphor of thoughts 
flowing through your mind heedlessly like clouds moving across the sky.
Here is a more formal definition, from a 2002 journal article called “What Do 
We Really Know About Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction?”:9
The meditation techniques are used to develop a perspective on 
thoughts and feelings so that they are recognized as mental events 
rather than as aspects of the self or as necessarily accurate reflec-
tions of reality. 
Vonnegut Would Have Grokked It
Okay, so it’s difficult to precisely pinpoint meditation in plain language. I 
view the general mindset as similar to that of a Kurt Vonnegut character, 
shrugging his shoulders and saying something nonsensical like, “Hey ho,” no 
matter what comes along.
To my mind, anytime someone is sitting or lying down in a dark room lis-
tening to music and attempting calmness, his behavior is already a whole 
lot healthier than about 1,000 other things he could be doing, so the tech-
niques are at least an excellent attempt at fitness. This is why I offer up a 
meditation tool at this point in the chapter. It’s called Attunement, and I’ve 
tried it a few times myself.
What I consider to be meditation happens a lot on the tops of moun-
tains and beside lakes and oceans. Calm sitting and letting the scenic 
view pour over you, emptying your mind, filling your soul—that 
counts; it undoubtedly has the same physical and psychic benefits.

Meditation Tools

Once you’ve installed the app on your phone, Attunement works by giving 
you a choice of several songs, some of which are designed to induce calm 
meditating, and some of which are designed to accompany yoga. Figure 9-18 
shows my choice—“Primordial,” of course.
Choose the song length and off you go, into a stress-reduced universe of 
your own creation. Although it’s no different than what you could initiate 
with your own iPod or other MP3 player, Meditation Oasis, the group who 
distributes the app, has hand-picked the music as appropriate for meditat-
ing. It has a whole site that’s devoted to meditation instructions, podcasts, 
and other tools. It’s worth a visit: www.meditationoasis.com/how-to-medi-
tate/simple-meditations/.

You fancy yourself the human equivalent of a Formula I race car. Or at least, 
that metaphor reflects how much you value your health. You want your 
engines to operate on the finest fuel, not the leftover stuff at the bottom 
of the deep fryer at your cousin’s big-box restaurant (although it would be 
noble if your car ran on that residue). If an important part of fitness is exer-
cise, then the raw ingredients for that regimen—the food you eat before 
and after (even if you bow out of eating during the workout)—are essential 
as well. 
The rules of thumb for eating aren’t very different for people who are strenu-
ously active and people who are mainly interested in staying out of the 
doctor’s office but have no desire to train for climbing Kilimanjaro. Eat well; 
eat nutritiously—and perhaps more copiously, if your adventures burn tons 
of calories. 
Consume real, nutrient-rich food (fruits, veggies, fish, fowl, beef, pastured 
eggs, nuts, whey protein/berry smoothies, etc.), not just filler that seems sin-
fully good at the moment but packs a big negative payback later. 
This chapter presents a few general guidelines for the best ways to tweak 
your diet in a quest to fuel your fitness goals. 
Fueling Fitness
If you’re an athlete or are taking part in fitness activities for the purpose of 
health and maintenance, you’re probably wondering if there is a better way 
to eat and drink to make you stronger, quicker, faster, and indefatigable. 
No magic nutrition bullets exist for fueling fitness, despite the giant indus-
try that has been assembled to sell us supplements that suggest we can 
be Superman or Superwoman as long as we consume their products (I did 
find references in the scientific literature that specify some supplements 
that may be of benefit—see the sidebar “Consider These for Supplement 
Experimentation”).

Fueling Fitness
Chapter 10

While they may be of help to some athletes, the supplements are unlikely 
to be a major part of your fueling process. They can give you an extra edge 
going into a high-intensity training session or a competition, but you can get 
that from something as simple as having a cup of coffee an hour before a run 
or a weightlifting session.
Fueling fitness for people who want to remain healthy yet add sport-specific 
strength is more a matter of small adjustments than radical changes in an 
otherwise healthy diet. Stick to the “eat for health” strategy and avoid pro-
cessed foods. 
One larger adjustment of note, however, could be moving from a 
high-carb diet, which has been almost universally recommended for 
athletes, to a Paleo diet for athletes involving a preference for fat and 
protein. I’ll cover this issue a bit in a sidebar at the end of this chapter.
This chapter covers some of the following aspects of sports-nutrition basics:
• Increasing your protein consumption a bit to provide the raw materi-
als for synthesizing and repairing muscles, as well as maintaining the 
integrity of all of the protein components of your body that need to 
have enough amino acids available for their cell- and tissue-building 
processes.
• Increasing caloric intake in general to accommodate the extra fuel you 
will need for your activities—you might want to lose a few extra pounds, 
but you don’t want to eat away your hard-earned lean body mass as 
your physical system reaches out for the extra gas it needs.
• Knowing the signs of dehydration, and drinking plenty of water before, 
often during, and after hard exercise.
• Using the “magic hour” following exercise, particularly weightlifting, to 
consume a high-quality protein meal such as one containing branched-
chain amino acids (BCAAs) and possibly a protein/carb mixture to pro-
duce the best results for muscle growth.
• Making sure you are properly fueled with micronutrients—all the 
vitamins and essential minerals important for fueling physical activity. 
Being geeks, we’ll also go into some details on these nutrients. 
Fueling fitness for people who 
want to remain healthy yet add 
sport-specific strength is more 
a matter of small adjustments 
than radical changes in an  
otherwise healthy diet.

Maintaining a Reasonable Protein Intake
Maintaining a Reasonable Protein Intake
For the strength- and power-related activities such as weightlifting, body-
weight workouts, and sprinting, it’s essential to absorb enough grams of 
protein on a daily basis to keep you net positive for that nutrient (i.e., so 
you’re making more protein tissues than you are breaking down for energy 
during the course of training). 
For most people, it’s easy to derive enough protein from a Western-style 
diet, unless you’re a vegetarian or vegan. In the former case, you have to be 
more conscientious to aim for protein sources that don’t involve meat or fish 
(eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt, avocados, nuts, whey protein shakes, tempeh, 
etc.), and for vegans, it’s just plain tough to maintain an adequate intake of 
essential amino acids on an active lifestyle (see Chapter 3 for more dietary 
protein specifics). Lots of nonmeat or nondairy foods, including vegetables 
and grains, contain protein, just not in a high enough quantity—i.e., these 
meals don’t have enough grams or milligrams of amino acids.
According to the article “Nutrition and Athletic Performance” from the 
journal Medecine & Science in Sports & Exercise, “Protein quality is a potential 
concern for individuals who avoid all animal proteins such as milk and meat 
(i.e., vegans). Their diets may be limited in lysine, threonine, tryptophan, or 
methionine.”1
How Much Protein Is Enough?
Of course, a geek is going to want to know exactly how much protein she 
needs to take in (in grams) on a daily basis, and where it’s going to come 
from. You probably don’t have to be obsessive about exact amounts, or too 
concerned with erring on the high side. But you might recall our discussion 
in Chapter 3 about the potential negative health ramifications of taking in 
more than about a third of your calories in protein—that’s one of the things 
you have to keep in mind as you plan meals over the long term.
A 2007 scientific-review article in the Journal of Sports Science called “Nutrition 
for the Sprinter” makes this sound recommendation:
Habitually high intakes, often greater than 2 g per kg per day, 
appear to be unnecessary for muscle hypertrophy and increased 
strength and power. It is likely that protein intake in excess of 1.7 g 
per kg per day is simply oxidized.2
I can tell you that the upper limit the article discusses (two grams per kilo-
gram per day) is easy to obtain if, for instance, you eat a nutritious diet that 
includes a big omelet (with real eggs) for breakfast and have meat, fish, pota-
toes or rice, and salad (with cheese) for dinner. The limit would only be 130 
grams for someone my size (65 kilograms); one decent-sized filet of salmon 
would get you about a third of the way there. 
For the strength- and  
power-related activities such as 
weightlifting, bodyweight  
workouts, and sprinting, it’s 
essential to absorb enough 
grams of protein on a daily 
basis to keep you net positive 
for that nutrient.

You can use a simple web-based protein calculator, and the Web is full of 
them. Here’s one: www.healthcalculators.org/calculators/protein.asp. You 
enter some criteria, such as your size, age, and activity level, and it spits out 
a number, such as 107 grams for me. 
NutritionData (www.nutritiondata.com) is a very good tool for determin-
ing the protein content of individual foods (see Chapter 2 on tools). FitDay 
(www.fitday.com) provides you with a more comprehensive picture of how 
much protein is contained in an entire meal, or your food intake for the  day 
or week. Figure 10-1, for example, shows the protein content of an omelet 
with tomato, broccoli, and Swiss cheese, and a kiwi on the side. That chow 
contained about 29 grams of protein.

It might seem counter to the prevailing wisdom to recommend taking in 
more calories. If your goal, however, is to put on additional muscle and pre-
vent the degradation of your lean mass, you’ll probably have to ingest more 
calories than you were prior to beginning your training program. The journal 
article “Nutrition for the Sprinter” points out that:
As early as 1907, Chittenden demonstrated that as long as energy 
intake is sufficient, athletes will gain muscle mass and increase 
strength even during periods of low protein intake. More recently, 
positive energy balance has been demonstrated to be more impor-
tant than the amount of protein ingested for gains in lean body 
mass during resistance training.3
By “positive energy balance,” the journal quote means taking in more calo-
ries than you expend. Go to FitDay or use your Fitbit dashboard, for example, 
to determine if you’re in a positive or negative calorie balance (Fitbit is cov-
ered in Chapter 2).

Code Maintenance: Human Fueling and Supplements 
265
Make Sure the Tank Is Full
If your total energy expenditure exceeds the calories you consume, you 
won’t be able to add lean mass (the exception being when you are making 
big gains at the very beginning of a new exercise regimen by losing that 
extra fat you’ve been carrying around, while adding a bit of muscle).
This balancing act might be a little more nuanced than you think, because 
you don’t want to add food to your plate and end up putting on a lot of extra 
fat. Rather than viewing this strategy as a license to eat, drink, and be merry, 
you might want to analyze the number of calories you are burning with the 
extra exercise. For this analysis, you can use Endomondo, the Fitbit Tracker, 
or any of the other tools we discuss in Chapter 2 and throughout the book. 
Basal Metabolic Rate and Activity Calculator
You can also estimate the number of calories you’re expending using a 
formula called the Harris-Benedict equation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Harris-Benedict_equation). The first part of the equation estimates your basal 
metabolic rate (BMR), or the amount of calories you expend in a day just 
keeping your internal organs and overall system functioning, but not includ-
ing the energy costs of exercise or general movement.
The key: w = weight in kilograms; h = height in centimeters; a = age in years. 
For men: (13.75 x w) + (5.003 x h) - (6.7775 x a) + 66.5
For women: (9.563 x w) + (1.85 x h) - (4.676 x a) + 655.1
Next, take the total of your BMR and multiply it by the appropriate “activity 
variable” in Table 10-1 (e.g., 1.9 for extremely active).
Table 10-1. Activity variables for determining calorie requirements
Activity variable

Little or no exercise and desk job
1.375
Lightly active
Light exercise or sports 1–3 days a week

Moderately active
Moderate exercise or sports 3–5 days a week
1.725
Very active
Hard exercise or sports 6–7 days a week
1.9
Extremely active

Let’s say you get a BMR of 1,668 (for a 5' 9" 35-year-old male who weighs 70 
kilograms, or 154 pounds). You are very active, so your total calorie expen-
diture comes to an estimated total of about 2,877 calories. 
Add a few hundred high-quality calories (e.g., lean meats, energy-packed 
veggies) per day above that amount, boosting it to 3,077, or about 3,000 
calories. This is the amount of calories you will need to consume per day if 

Make Sure the Tank Is Full
Chapter 10
266
you’re working out very hard with resistance training, and want to add some 
extra pounds of muscle. Make sure to drink plenty of water as well.
If the estimated figure seems low (as it does to me), experiment. If you can-
not add any weight after a few weeks, add another hundred good calories 
per day. And make sure you are eating well in the hour following training, as 
we’ll discuss later in the chapter.
The timing of when you take in these extra calories is important, as the 
article “Nutrition for the Sprinter” points out:
Training adaptations may depend less on the amount of protein 
ingested, and more on the type of proteins ingested, timing of inges-
tion, and other nutrients ingested in the same meal.4
For example, eating within an hour after training will improve the likelihood 
of building lean mass for someone like a sprinter or team-sports person who 
desires to add strength and muscle. 
Pre-Exercise Eating
In terms of timing, however, consuming carbs before, for instance, a typical 
gym workout actually inhibits your ability to burn fats during the exercise. 
Again, from “Nutrition for the Sprinter”:
Carbohydrate ingestion has a very strong inhibiting effect on fat 
oxidation. The ingestion of 50–100 grams [or 200 to 400 calories’ 
worth] of carbohydrate in the hour before exercise will inhibit lipoly-
sis and will also reduce fat oxidation [during the exercise] by about 
30–40%.5
Lipolysis means the release of triglycerides from your fat stores so that they 
can be broken down into free fatty acids (FFAs) and used as muscle fuel. 
Eating carbs before exercising restricts this mechanism. However, endur-
ance athletes who are entering a fast-paced workout have to make sure that 
their glycogen stores are topped up, so they have a different priority vis à vis 
the carb meals. See the sidebar titled “A Paleo Diet for Athletes” for a related 
discussion.
All Protein Is Not Created Equal
As Chapter 3 discusses, proteins are made up of chains of amino acids. A 
subset of these amino acids, the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), are 
growth-promoting and therefore of particular interest among certain kinds 
of athletes. 
The BCAAs, a subset of the essential amino acids (see Chapter 3), are leucine, 
isoleucine, and valine. The amino acids arginine and glutamine, along with 
leucine, also play a role in stimulating the growth pathway in the body, 
mTOR. (see the sidebar titled “The mTOR Pathway Is Our Growth Machine”). 

Code Maintenance: Human Fueling and Supplements 
267
Make Sure the Tank Is Full
A recently published study review from the journal Nutrition & Metabolism 
underlines the efficacy of whey protein, which contains the three BCAAs, as 
a muscle-building and -sparing supplement. The amino acid leucine, which 
whey contains, seems to be a key constituent for building muscle, according 
to the review:
Leucine, acting as a signaling molecule in the mTOR cascade…, has 
been shown to be a critical amino acid for increasing skeletal muscle 
protein synthesis. [...] Leucine may also be involved in suppressing 
muscle protein degradation.6
Leucine is present in adequate amounts in most of the typical sources of 
protein you will be eating. The following sources have more than three 
grams of that amino acid (per 200-calorie serving): eggs, fish (many variet-
ies), chicken, turkey, various game meats such as elk or buffalo, dried sea-
weed (spirulina), pork, shrimp, duck, etc. See the whole list here: http://bit.ly/
nutritiondataleucine.
A whey protein shake with a typical serving (for example, the one I use 
in smoothies) provides the following amounts of the BCAAs: leucine (2.9 
grams), isoleucine (1.6 grams), and valine (1.7 grams).
The mTOR Pathway Is Our Growth Machine
If you frequent any of the 
muscle-building sites on the Web, 
looking to pick up some tips, 
you’re going to encounter a lot of 
articles and references to mTOR. 
This is a pathway in the human 
body whose name stands for 
mammalian target of rapamycin. A 
pathway is a built-in sequence of 
chemical reactions.
People who want to add lean mass are not only trying to 
impress their friends with geeky biological acronyms, but 
they want to stimulate mTOR, which is responsible for 
anabolism, or cell growth in the body.
I talked with Professor David Sabatini, whose lab studies 
mTOR at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, MA. He’s an 
Associate Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology (MIT), among many other things.
Why is mTOR important to someone who is trying to build lean 
mass?
mTOR is a central pathway for anabolism—the regulator 
in the balance between making or breaking stuff down. 
It controls if you’re in a catabolic or anabolic state. The 
pathway is on if you have [the presence of] nutrients and 
growth factors like insulin and IGF.
How do you turn on mTOR?
What’s most interesting from a scientific standpoint is that 
mTOR senses everything; it has antennae out there that 
detect pretty much anything you can think of. The key 
nutrients mTOR senses are glucose and amino acids (AA)—
leucine is a very important AA [for turning on mTOR]. The 
other amino acids mTOR cares about are glutamine and 
arginine.
Where is mTOR centered in the body?
mTOR exists everywhere in the body; that’s the simple 
answer. From a functional point of view, tissues like your 
muscle, fat, and liver have mTOR and are kind of on the re-
ceiving end. When they receive signals that say, “Hey, we’re 
in an anabolic state,” then they build mass: muscle will build 
muscle protein, the liver will build glycogen and protein, fat 
cells will build fat—there are many tissues that have what I 
would call the receiving mTOR, waiting for signals to build 
stuff. 
Then there is the MTOR that’s in more specialized master-
controller tissues, like the hypothalamus and pancreatic 
beta cells where the role more is to sense that you’re in the 
anabolic state. To tell tissues to grow.

Make Sure the Tank Is Full
Chapter 10

The mTOR Pathway Is Our Growth Machine (continued)
So we think always of mTOR as upstream and downstream 
of itself; it does the sensing of the appropriate state, then it 
does the work of turning on the machinery to make growth 
happen. You don’t think of your hypothalamus as growing, 
but mTOR is there saying, “Hey, there’s amino acids around 
[so] let’s send signals to tell other big tissues to grow.”
So you can turn on mTOR with resistance training?
You can do resistance training and that will turn on mTOR, 
but it’s almost like a computational AND gate. You need 
the resistance training, but if you don’t have the nutrients, 
nothing’s going to happen, because the system is smart. 
You can’t make mass without nutrients or energy. Whether 
the input is IGF, weight lifting, AMP kinase inhibitor—if you 
don’t have the raw ingredients, the system is built to turn 
things off.
I’ve read about, and experienced, good results with fasting 
and weightlifting. How does this fit in with mTOR and the 
required nutrients?
Our bodies have strong homeostatic mechanisms. We cer-
tainly have plenty of nutrients flowing through our blood, 
but once your body can no longer keep a homeostatic 
nutrient level, it’s going to be much harder to let growth 
happen.
[Editorial note: that’s why it’s important to eat after fasting 
and training.]

search/faculty/sabatini.html.
Carbs and Protein: Both in the Mix
In terms of eating after exercise to maintain and add lean mass, it seems 
both protein and carbs play important roles. 
“Carbohydrates and proteins may be the best strategy for [the] stimulation 
of anabolic pathways,” according to “Nutrition for the Sprinter.”  The “utiliza-
tion of ingested amino acids for [the] synthesis of muscle proteins is greatest 
when carbohydrates are ingested concurrently with an amino acid source…. 
The effect of carbohydrates is presumably due to the associated insulin 
release. Insulin increases net muscle protein balance following resistance 
exercise primarily by blocking the rise in muscle protein breakdown.”7 So, 
add some berries and/or banana to your whey protein shake just after work-
ing out, or a pile or rice or sweet potato with your fish or steak.

Water and Hydration
Where Did You Get All That Energy?
The human body is a smart 
system that has evolved to 
offer a number of different 
energy sources throughout 
the body to fuel activities of 
varying intensities. The fuel 
sources range from creatine 
phosphate (CP) in muscle 
cells, to the stored glycogen 
in the liver and skeletal 
muscles, to stored fat in 
muscles and adipose tissue. 
Different types of exercise 
rely on these energy sources 
in varying ways.
CP is an anaerobic en-
ergy source in the muscles 
(meaning it does not require 
oxygen). It fuels very short 
duration, high-intensity 
contractions—such as up to 
10 seconds. “The amount of 
creatine phosphate available in skeletal muscle is approxi-
mately four times greater than ATP and, therefore, [CP] is 
the primary fuel used for high-intensity, short-duration 
activities such as the clean and jerk in weight lifting or the 
fast break in basketball.”8
This mechanism is called the phosphagen system.
Glycolysis is a mechanism that the body relies on to fuel 
longer events, such as a 400-meter sprint. Glycolytic fuel 
derives from glycogen, as well as any glucose that the body 
has made available in the bloodstream. Recall that the 
liver and muscles store relatively small amounts of glyco-
gen—roughly 1,200 or more calories’ worth—in the form 
of animal starch. From the journal article “Nutrition and 
Athletic Performance”:
Approximately 25%–35% of total muscle glycogen 
stores are used during a single 30-s sprint or resis-
tance exercise bout. Neither the phosphagen nor the 
glycolytic pathway can sustain the rapid provision 
of energy to allow muscles to contract at a very high 
rate for events lasting greater than 2–3 min.9
What about all those longer endurance events? The body 
uses the aerobic, or oxidative, pathway to fuel hours-long 
exercise—glycogen, fats, and to a lesser extent amino acids 
(including from the carbs, fats, and protein you consume 
during the event). “As oxygen becomes more available to 
the working muscle, the body uses more of the aerobic (oxi-
dative) pathways and less of the anaerobic (phosphagen 
and glycolytic) pathways.”10
At “70 percent of maximal oxygen capacity,” about 50 to 60 
percent of energy comes from carbs, and most of the rest 
from fats.11 When exercise intensity drops, you start utilizing 
more fats for energy, which makes sense, considering that 
you have so much more available and stored in the body 
compared with glycogen. In fact, the amount of calories 
stored as triglycerides in the muscles, not even counting all 
the other fat depots in the body, exceeds the storage capac-
ity of glycogen.
“As a result of aerobic training, the energy derived from fat 
increases and from carbohydrates decreases. A trained in-
dividual uses a greater percentage of fat than an untrained 
person does at the same workload. Long-chain fatty aids 
derived from stored muscle triglycerides are the preferred 
fuel for aerobic exercise for individuals involved in mild- to 
moderate-intensity exercise.”12 So as you’re walking or hik-
ing, for instance, the preferred fuel is fat, just as it is at rest.
These facts suggest that you should replenish your glyco-
gen levels with carbs before short, intense events, and don’t 
shrink from fats as a major source of fuel for long, slow 
efforts.
Water and Hydration
Remaining properly hydrated when you exercise is important and, most 
of the time, easy to do. Use common sense and listen to your body. The 
hydration requirements for weightlifting at room temperature for up to 40 
minutes are not that great; drink enough water beforehand so you’re not 
going into the training session thirsty. The requirements for running in a 

Water and Hydration
Chapter 10

hot road race or summer triathlon are a different ballgame—you have to 
be well hydrated before the event and have a plan for adequate hydration 
during the race. 
The consequences of dehydration can be very bad, particularly if it’s a hot, 
humid event promoting a lot of sweat loss. 
Sweat loss can vary among individuals and weather conditions, from 
0.3 to 2.4 liters per hour!
First it’s muscle cramps, and you’re basically reduced to walking out the 
course. The cramps probably reflect the significant loss of potassium and 
sodium in sweat. You can replenish both minerals with a decent electrolyte 
sports drink such as Accelerade or Heed. 
Heat stroke can follow the cramping, in the worse-case scenario, if you 
haven’t properly responded to the dehydration and you’re trying to push 
through the heat. Heat stroke involves a body temperature in excess of 104, 
and it can be fatal. 
I’ve heard of more cases of hyponatremia lately. This malady besetting some 
marathoners involves drinking too much before and during an event (or 
simply excessive salt loss through sweating), to the level of diluting the salt 
in your body (a serum sodium concentration of less than 130 mmol·L).13 It 
can also be fatal. So, the bottom line is to properly hydrate if you’re going to 
do long, challenging events and, in general, monitor your hydration levels 
while exercising.
Guidelines
There isn’t any more suave way to put it: you can find out how well hydrated 
you are by observing the color of your pee. If it’s clear, you are well hydrated. 
If it’s dark yellow, drink up. Make sure it’s clear before any event you are 
doing, like a weekend bike ride or road race. 
The best thing to do is to practice your hydration strategy for weeks in train-
ing if you’re going to enter something challenging. The article “Nutrition and 
Athletic Performance” contains other hydration reminders:
The goal of drinking is to prevent dehydration from occurring during 
exercise and individuals should not drink in excess of sweating rate. 
After exercise, drink approximately 16–24 oz. (450–675 mL.) of fluid 
for every pound (0.5 kg) of body weight lost during exercise.14
Another guideline is to drink water and/or sports drinks up to four hours 
before an event. “At least 4 hours before exercise, individuals should drink 
approximately 5–7 milliliters (mL) per kilogram (kg) body weight (2–3 mL per 
pound) of water or a sport beverage.”15  This means if a person weighs 140 
pounds, she should drink about 14 ounces; or, if she weighs 60 kilograms, 
she should sip up to half a liter four hours before the event.

Water and Hydration
These levels seem a bit low to me, especially four hours before an 
event. Heat, nervousness, and the warm-up can dehydrate you prior to 
an event or big exercise bout. Hours before you start, monitor your pee 
color and respond to your body’s thirst reflex, and drink accordingly.
This protocol is more difficult to meet if the event starts at seven in the 
morning (unless you’re tossing and turning). You could make sure your pee 
was clear before you went to bed.
Pre-Event Jitters and Coffee: It’s All in Your Head
So much of health and physical preparation is psychic and 
spiritual. Belief is very powerful; never underestimate it. It’s 
actually reassuring to know that there are elements of your 
body and mind that no scientist may ever put his finger 
on, and thus reduce them to a pill, for instance. I have one 
funny story that in its own small way illustrates this notion.
I was signed up for a triathlon once in Vermont, and I had 
a small motel room facing the woods. I kept the window 
open all night because the room was stifling. The motel 
had a swamp or wetlands behind it, and all night it emitted 
an incessant cacophony of frog croaks. I don’t remember 
falling asleep at all. I finally rolled out of bed in the morning, 
somewhat in a panic (I used to really obsess over pre-event 
sleeps; now I don’t, knowing I’ll focus on a good sleep 
afterward). 
“At least I’ve got strong coffee with me!” I thought. I made a 
big pot of strong dark roast, and started quaffing it down. I 
had a banana, a bagel with peanut butter, and a Powerbar. 
Feeling the caffeine kick in, I headed off to do all the little 
things you have to do before a triathlon starts. I ended 
up having a great swim-bike-run for me, feeling strong 
throughout, and shattered my course record. 
I headed back to my motel afterward to pack my stuff, my 
little finisher’s medal dangling around my neck, and hap-
pened to pick up the bag of coffee I’d used that morning. It 
was decaf! My brain had actually tricked me into thinking 
that I was stoked on strong coffee, and that phenomenon 
had suitably prepared me for the two-hour-plus event.
Cold and Altitude Also Affect Hydration
Just because it’s not hot doesn’t mean you don’t have to hydrate. People 
often get dehydrated in cold environments because the tendency to drink 
falls off. You spend so much time preoccupied with staying warm that you 
don’t bother to guzzle water or tea. Use the pee test in these environments 
as well. 
You pee more at altitude (sorry for all the pee references—this increased 
urination at altitude is called diuresis), so you have to be conscientious about 
hydrating during hikes and climbs, especially above 8,000 feet, or 2,438 
meters, of elevation. According to “Nutrition and Athletic Performance”: 
Respiratory water losses may be as high as 1900 milliliters (mL) [per] 
day (1.9 L [per] day) in men and 850 mL [per] day (0.85 L [per] day) 
in women. Total fluid intake at high altitude approaches 3–4 liters 
(L) [per] day to promote optimal kidney function and maintain urine 
output of ∼1.4 L in adults.16
You begin to lose your appetite at altitude as well, which can mean fewer 
opportunities to reach for the fluids, as you’re not gobbling food.

Proper hydration is absolutely key to staving off Acute Mountain Sickness 
(AMS), which will definitely ruin your summit attempt.
A Few Supplements for Athletes to Consider
Carnosine may be a useful supplement for sprinters and 
other fast-running athletes (e.g., soccer players), according 
to the Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise article “Nutri-
tion for the Sprinter.” 
Carnosine is a protein involving the amino acids alanine 
and histidine. “Carnosine is found primarily in type IIa and 
type IIx fibers in skeletal muscle.”17 It is not difficult, how-
ever, to locate a supplement company that will be happy 
to sell you carnosine products, so try to be sensible and 
selective in your considerations (it’s not to be confused with 
creatine, another supplement). 
Carnosine is a primary substance the body uses for buffer-
ing, which means compensating for the rising acidity levels 
in muscles and blood when you’re exercising strenuously. 
The increase in lactic acid is what causes the “exercise burn” 
at the end of a sprint or a tough series of weightlifting reps, 
for instance. Sodium bicarbonate is also a buffering agent. 
Carnosine may show some promise in other health areas, 
according to this article and its concluding references. 
In theory, increasing skeletal muscle carnosine levels 
(via beta-alanine supplementation or intense train-
ing) should increase buffering capacity, delay 
fatigue, and increase exercise performance. Higher 
carnosine concentration in muscle was associated 
with higher mean power from a 30-[second] maxi-
mal sprint on a cycle ergometer.18
Caffeine, such as that found in a strong cup of coffee or tea, 
is a suitable supplement before a sprint, a weightlifting 
session, or even a longer event. Caffeine mobilizes free fatty 
acids and acts as a central nervous system stimulant.19
Sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, is also a well-doc-
umented supplement for sprinters (e.g., track and field, 
cycling, rowing), but you should only experiment with it in 
small doses because it can cause gastrointenstinal distress 
such as diarrhea:
Reviews of the available literature suggest a dose–
response relationship between the amount of bicar-
bonate ingested and the observed performance 
effect (Horswill, 1995). A dose of 200 milligram (mg) 
per kilogram (kg) body mass ingested 1–2 hours 
before exercise seems to improve performance in 
most studies, but 300 mg per kg body mass appears 
to be the optimum dose (with tolerable side-effects 
for most athletes). Doses of less than 100 mg per kg 
body mass do not affect performance.
Intakes of more than 300 mg per kg body mass tend 
to result in gastrointestinal problems. Most of these 
studies, however, used exercise lasting longer than 1 
min and in most the exercise intensity and duration 
were comparable to middle-distance running not 
sprints.
No studies have shown an effect on performance 
in high-intensity exercise lasting less than 1 min. 
Therefore, a window for efficacy of bicarbonate 
has been identified between approximately 1 and 7 
min and sprint events are not likely to be affected. 
Nevertheless, the use of bicarbonate is common 
in 400-m running, with anecdotal support for its 
efficacy.20
Creatine is manufactured in the human body out of amino 
acids, and most of it is found in skeletal muscle.21 Creatine 
increases energy or ATP for the muscles, which has obvi-
ously sparked interest in its use as an energy-boosting 
supplement.

Micronutrient Replenishment 
A Few Supplements for Athletes to Consider (continued)
Whereas the creatine studies do not show sprinters running 
faster22, it could help them gain lean mass and power, and 
certainly the latter benefit would be of interest to resistance 
trainers:
…It is important to emphasize that results from well-
controlled laboratory studies consistently indicate 
that creatine supplementation can enhance power 
output during short maximal exercise…, in particu-
lar during intermittent series (10–30 s) of maximal 
muscle contractions… interspersed by 1–2 min rest 
intervals[…]
Heavy resistance training accounts for an important 
fraction of the total training volume in elite sprinters. 
It has been well documented that creatine supple-
mentation can potentiate the gains in fat-free mass 
and muscle force and power output that accompany 
resistance training…. Thus, creatine supplemen-
tation conceivably could contribute to improving 
sprint performance by enhancing the efficacy of 
resistance training.23
Micronutrient Replenishment 
Vitamins and minerals are obviously of paramount importance. An athlete 
who’s training harder needs more food, and thus increased amounts of vita-
mins and minerals, to make up for greater “metabolic turnover”—i.e., using 
up the micronutrients at a higher rate than average, because she is generat-
ing more energy and ramping up her metabolism.
The bulk of this extra nutrition can come from all those nutritious extra foods 
you are eating. A multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplement or individual sup-
plements (e.g., vitamin D3 or magnesium) might be necessary, however, if 
your training load is particularly high or you are a vegetarian/vegan, if you’re 
not consuming enough fat and thus fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). 
RDA Levels May Not Be Enough
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for these vitamins and miner-
als are really minimum levels for the average person. If you have a very high 
activity rate, you may focus on getting higher levels than the RDAs for micro-
nutrients. According to “Nutrition and Athletic Performance”: “The most 
common vitamins and minerals found to be of concern in athletes’ diets are 
calcium and vitamin D, the B vitamins; iron, zinc, magnesium, as well as some 
antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, β-carotene, and selenium.”24 In other 
words, with increased levels of exercising come the risks of deficiencies in 
most of the major micronutrients.
If you’re exercising moderately most days and have been conscientious 
about taking in larger amounts of nutritious foods (a big if), and if you don’t 
have a nagging fatigue or difficulty healing from injuries, you’re probably 
getting adequate vitamins and minerals.

Micronutrient Replenishment 
Chapter 10
274
Here are some highlights of how important vitamins are for the training/
competing athlete, as well as for anyone who has ramped up their exercise 
levels significantly:
• “The B-complex vitamins have two major functions directly related to 
exercise. Thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine (B6), pantothenic acid, 
and biotin are involved in energy production during exercise…whereas 
folate and vitamin B12 are required for the production of red blood cells, 
for protein synthesis, and in tissue repair and maintenance including the 
CNS [central nervous system].” 25
• We wrote a lot about vitamin D in Chapter 4; it may be advantageous for 
athletes to supplement vitamin D at greater than the RDA level.
• “Athletes at [the] greatest risk for poor antioxidant intakes are those 
following a low-fat diet, restricting energy intakes, or limiting dietary 
intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.”26 This means that you 
have to make sure to get enough vitamin C and E, and the mineral sele-
nium. See Chapter 4 for more information on antioxidants.
• “The high incidence of iron depletion among athletes is usually attrib-
uted to inadequate energy intake. Other factors that can impact iron 
status include vegetarian diets that have poor iron availability, periods 
of rapid growth, training at high altitudes, increased iron losses in sweat, 
feces, urine, menstrual blood, intravascular hemolysis, foot-strike hemo-
lysis, regular blood donation, or injury…. Athletes, especially women, 
long-distance runners, adolescents, and vegetarians should be screened 
periodically to assess and monitor iron status…. Because reversing iron-
deficiency anemia can require 3–6 months, it is advantageous to begin 
nutrition intervention before iron deficiency anemia develops.”27

A Paleo Diet for Athletes
Some active people are experimenting with a so-called 
Paleolithic, or Paleo, diet for fueling sports, feeling that the 
answer doesn’t always lie in the prototypical high-carbo-
hydrate diet for athletes. The adaptation to the diet may be 
difficult at first, as there is little to no carbo-loading—the 
spaghetti, pizza, and bread that have been a part of so 
many preparations for marathons and triathlons. 
Paleo certainly doesn’t mean that you give up salads or 
potatoes, by the way; it simply means that you move to a 
lower percentage of carbs in your dietary ratio—a change 
that may be metabolically healthier.
Athletes who adopt a higher-fat diet experience some ben-
eficial adaptations: they increase the oxidation or usage of 
fats while exercising, and become more efficient at burning 
the fats that the muscles store for energy.28
High-carb diets appear to still be necessary for endurance 
athletes who are competing at long distances and cruising 
along at very high rates, such as triathletes, middle-distance 
runners, and cyclists doing time trials. Combining a high-fat 
diet with a two- to three-day carbo-loading period (to top 
off the glycogen) appears to have some promise.29
Another study discussed the notion of taking more 
energy-dense foods such as fats on ultra-endurance events 
where athletes are largely responsible for providing all of 
their food.30 High-fat diets like a Paleo approach might be 
optimal for these ultra distances, where the athlete motors 
along at a slow but persistent rate.
There is at least one book devoted to this topic that you 
might want to check out, called The Paleo Diet for Athletes.31
The athletes who go Paleo often point to feeling less sore 
post-exercise and the day after hard efforts, after removing 
the bulk of the grains from their diet. It provides plenty of 
energy too, but more from fats and protein than from the 
extra carbs. 
The personal evidence is empirical, but hey, I have a lengthy 
experience with both approaches, so I might as well throw 
in my own two cents. I used to eat a lot of spaghetti, rice, 
salad, and meat before my long races, and most of the time 
I got good race results. For various reasons, such as less 
inflammation and the probability that we are not evolved 
for a heavy-carb diet, I now lean toward an approach that 
involves the consumption of a more moderate amount of 
these macronutrients. 
Back in the day, I found a really good carb-rich sports 
drink that worked well to sustain energy levels during a 
two-hour+ event (it will go unnamed as I’m not interested 
in using a brand-name beverage as a whipping boy), but 
unfortunately it also ended up giving me the only cavity 
I’ve gotten since childhood, due to its sugar content and 
how much I was taking in.)
Jump ahead to a long, difficult mountain climb I did in my 
fifties, similar to an ultra-endurance event. Slow, with lots 
of pauses. Suffice it to say, the effort required thousands of 
calories per day; especially the last day, which was cold, at 
altitude, and lasted the better part of 17 hours. I did bring 
carbs along in the form of energy bars, but far better than 
half of my calories were fat and protein (nuts, high-cacao 
chocolate, and chunks of my favorite raw cheddar). 
While that’s not orthodox Paleo, because it includes dairy, 
it is more of a high-fat and -protein approach, and the 
mountaineer’s mess tent cooked up plenty of protein and 
fat too, like cheesy eggs and bacon, as well as avocado and 
tomato burritos. 
The feeding strategy worked very well; I climbed well and 
never had altitude or energy problems. I consumed very 
little simple sugars. My preparations were rushed and, as 
a result, I’d probably do it differently next time, bringing a 
greater variety of snack foods for climbing.
In a nutshell, a Paleo diet for athletes involves eating more 
meat, fish, plenty of veggies and fruit, nuts such as almonds 
and macadamias, pastured eggs, coconut milk/whey pro-
tein shakes for a good protein/healthy fat supplement—a 
macronutrient ratio that generally emphasizes fat (no trans 
fat and ease up on the Omega 6s) and protein over carbs. 
Tubers and starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes and 
plantains are also a part of Paleo mealtimes. It’s becoming 
easier for Paleo athletes to find foods these days as the 
diet eases into the mainstream, such as Paleo energy-bar 
recipes.

Little things matter when it comes to fitness, particularly when multiplied 
over a lifetime. That’s why I don’t think it’s superficial to consider various 
“hacks” or health-related habits and borderline-kooky angles (e.g., diving 
into freezing water) that do not necessarily fall under the rubric of the “fit-
ness big three” of nutrition, proper exercise, and sleep/stress management. 
I know of a Brooklyn, New York man, a famous Coney Island strongman, 
who was known to take frequent, not just annual, winter swims. He swore 
by the health benefits of cold-water immersion; he lived to be 105, and the 
only reason he didn’t live longer was that he was struck by a minivan a few 
years ago while taking a five-mile walk in the city. It appeared that but for 
this tragic accident, he was well on his way to being perhaps the oldest, 
strongest-for-his-age American male in history. It doesn’t seem a stretch to 
view his cold-water swims as one healthy component of this extraordinary 
example of a long “health-span.”
This chapter discusses other little hacks, such as the concept of hormesis, or 
good stress, sports massage, and the aforementioned cold-water immer-
sion, that can make a difference in the pursuit of fitness.
Hormesis
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, or so goes a saying. Ernest 
Hemingway wrote a memorable line in A Farewell to Arms: “The world breaks 
everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.” 
Scientists actually have a word for a stimulus or good stress that has an 
adaptive effect on the body—hormesis. The word is derived from the Greek 
hórmēsis, meaning “rapid motion, eagerness” (even though that definition 
does not seem to fit with our discussion here—see http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Hormesis). A number of activities, some widely familiar and some not, 
fall under hormesis, and they’ve been the subject of numerous laboratory 
studies and published hypotheses. Here’s how a scientific journal article 
called  “Dose Response” described the hormetic phenomenon: 
	
Lifestyle Hacks for Fitness

Hormesis
Chapter 11
278
Low doses of otherwise harmful agents are beneficial at threshold 
low levels. The beneficial hormetic response involves the adaptive 
stress response to the low dose toxic challenge as multiple con-
served protective enzymatic and signaling systems are activated 
by stress…. These fundamental survival pathways, when activated, 
confer plasticity [or better fitness and adaptability to changes in the 
environment] to species longevity.1
Using Anti-Patterns for Fitness
Anti-patterns are a concept that is popular in the program-
ming or geek world. The idea is that you learn efficient 
methods of designing code by studying lousy code. It really 
makes sense, when you think about it. You don’t know what 
good code is until you’ve seen bad code, which, unfor-
tunately, many of us in the software world have encoun-
tered many times. For example, a basic anti-pattern in the 
object-oriented programming world of Java and C Sharp is 
a piece of code that does something complicated, but only 
uses three or fewer classes (units of code), thus failing to 
adhere to the basics of object-oriented design by separat-
ing the program’s various responsibilities into a cluster of 
uncoupled, logical classes. The classic unreadable blob of 
“spaghetti code” is another typical anti-pattern.
Chapter 1 actually begins with an anti-pattern for fitness—
sitting all day in the dark, hardly ever moving, and living 
off of vending machines. That’s kind of an obvious anti-
pattern for living, and one we Westerners at least have been 
advised to avoid since the get-go (unfortunately, the advice 
hasn’t affected our behavior very much; we still “cheat” too 
much). Anti-patterns, however, can represent small subtle-
ties and nuances. For example, here’s a “do’s and don’t’s” site 
for Java programmers: http://javaantipatterns.wordpress.
com.
One example is if you have a method in your program that 
returns an array or Java List object (a collection of things 
like numbers, as in [1,2,3,4,5], an array of numbers), 
never return null from the method; always just return an 
empty List or array (one of the ideas being that you could 
cause the caller of that method to crash by trying to invoke 
a method on the returned null object, which raises an 
exception in Java).
Fitness abounds with potential anti-patterns, or wrong 
ways of doing things, and examining them can be instruc-
tive. A classic anti-pattern is overtraining, and what immedi-
ately comes to mind is an anecdote from the excellent book 
by Dr. Doug McGuff called Body by Science. In this book, 
he discusses training some hockey players during the pre-
season. The young players gained several pounds of muscle 
weight, or lean mass, and had excellent body composition 
after leaving his gym. They then entered traditional hockey 
training at the rink, and their coaches overtrained them, 
apparently to a high degree. The end result was that even 
though they were working much harder at the rink, they 
had actually lost the hard-earned new muscle and had 
poorer body composition. 
Whether or not you think they are useful, the popular sleep-
analysis devices like Zeo are fertile sources for anti-patterns 
for presleep nutrition and behavior. Just eat at the wrong 
time and drink too much wine or caffeine before sleep, and 
view the literal sleep patterns that the device produces, 
showing the poor-quality REM sleep and disrupted pat-
terns. The data represents an anti-pattern we can study to 
determine better ways to eat or drink to produce higher-
quality sleeps.
Another anti-pattern that comes to mind is taking a single-
dose megavitamin. You might have a good reason to take 
a large dose of vitamin C, for example, but the dose is 
better absorbed if the supplement is taken throughout the 
day in smaller units (of, say, 200 mg) than in one massive 
hit. Another fitness anti-pattern is doing the exact same 
workout all the time. A lot of people do that; we’re creatures 
of habit. You’re likely to plateau fairly quickly, however, in 
terms of strength or cardiovascular fitness, unless you vary 
your routine.

Hormesis
Translation: our bodies have built-in metabolic pathways that are “switched 
on” by various environmental stresses (cold, heat, exercise, etc.). Good things 
happen physically as a result of the activation of these signaling pathways, 
such as a potential for improved immunity against diseases, the upregula-
tion of machinery for repairing damaged DNA and proteins (a damage that 
can lead to cancer), and improved antioxidant defenses.
A vaccine is an example of hormesis, in that we inject ourselves with a 
weakened pathogen, and this action “tricks” the body or educates the 
immune system to defend itself against that germ. This is a disease-
prevention measure, however, and not really a fitness tweak.
The dose matters, however. And that makes sense. Low doses of nutritious 
substances can be hazardous at high doses, even in regard to drinking 
water (hyponatremia, the dilution of your body’s salt content, can be caused 
by excessive hydration). With hormesis, a concept you should keep in mind 
while rebooting your lifestyle is that discrete small doses of the following 
foods or activities can have beneficial effects over the long run:
• Cold and heat stress, such as through cold showers or saunas, and par-
ticularly the combination of the two.
• High-intensity exercise—we’ll discuss “exercise stress” later in this chapter.
• Caloric restriction and fasting, discussed at length in Chapter 6.
• Assorted other things, such as having one drink at night (without driv-
ing, of course), consuming substances such as curcumin or turmeric, 
and other activities that I cannot prove but suspect may have a hormetic 
effect, such as wilderness treks that involve potential (but seldom real-
ized) hazards that temporarily scare the crap out of you, in a good way. 
I explain this theory in more detail later in this chapter.
Cold and Heat Stress
Experiments have shown that cold and heat stress increase cellular defenses 
against these conditions, and various published hypotheses have pointed 
to cold-water exposure as a potential treatment for depression,2 as well as 
a possible boost for the immune system.3 So, for practical purposes, what is 
heat and cold stress? 
An example of heat stress is a sauna. The combination of a sauna and a cold 
shower is popular in countries such as Finland, and a number of northern 
European cultures and others throughout the world have adopted varia-
tions of these practices. A sauna that is not too hot, and where you sit or lie 
for a reasonable amount of time, provides enough heat stress to possibly 
have a hormetic effect.
Our bodies have built-in 
metabolic pathways that are 
“switched on” by various  
environmental stresses (cold, 
heat, exercise, etc.).

A rule of thumb in saunas, for adults, is that if your hair becomes hot 
to the touch, you’ve been in there long enough. Very hot dry air can 
be bad for the lungs. As a result, many saunas include some water to 
splash over the hot coals or rocks, thus moistening the air. Children 
should not spend much longer than a minute in a sauna; in my experi-
ence, they’re usually smart and instinctive enough to leave a sauna 
right away anyway. A typical heated-up sauna can be 130 degrees 
Fahrenheit (F) or thereabouts. Combine a sauna with a cold shower or 
pool.
Heat stress such as running a marathon in 90+ degrees F is not a good exam-
ple of hormesis—the heat-stress dosage is way too high and can damage 
the body, or even kill you with heat stroke (or hyponatremia, if you guzzle 
too much water). 
An example of cold stress is a cool shower or the classic polar plunge in 40- 
to 68-degree F water for a short period of time (particularly at those freezing 
temperatures). 
One study found that cold-water immersion elevated several immune-
system factors by small but significant margins, but only after six weeks of 
pretty regular immersions at 57 degrees F, 14 Celsius (C).4 The study also 
found that the cold-water swimming, predictably, increased the subjects’ 
metabolic rate.
When you shiver in the cold, this is the body’s natural reaction to 
generate its own heat with automatic muscle contractions in order to 
keep your body temperature warm and stable. Non-shivering thermo-
genesis can also occur in the cold. The net effect is that you burn more 
calories via thermogenesis, particularly if you are outside in the cold 
most of the day, as in the case of outdoor workers, ski patrollers, or just 
someone winter hiking or Nordic or alpine skiing.
Another study, titled “Improved Antioxidative Protection in Winter Swimmers,” 
suggested that winter swimming increases the body’s utilization of its major 
antioxidant biochemical, glutathione.5 Glutathione is a key biochemical in 
mopping up oxidative damage, or “bodily rust,” which is at the center of 
aging and some diseases such as cancer.
I think we can more or less conclude that exposing yourself to a cold shower 
or swim once in a while is healthy, and it feels really good, once you get 
over the initial discomfort. See the sidebar on the mammalian dive reflex 
for information on what happens to us physiologically when we dive into 
cold water, and obviously, take care not to do anything dangerous like hurl 
yourself into 38-degree rapids, unless that’s your job (like Bear Grylls of Man 
vs. Wild fame).

Before You Take the Dive, Consider the Mammalian Dive Reflex
One way to take advantage of 
the benefits of cold-water im-
mersion is to take the plunge 
in a cold river or ocean. But 
take some precautions first, 
such as making sure you can 
get out quickly if it’s very cold, 
as in 55 degrees F or colder. 
You also probably shouldn’t 
take a very cold water plunge 
if you have a preexisting heart 
condition.
You have only about five minutes when the water is 50 
degrees F or cooler before you lose dexterity in your arms 
and legs, and if it’s colder than 60 F, you have about 10 to 15 
minutes without protective clothing.6 
As mammals, humans have a built-in physical response, an 
oxygen-conserving mechanism, to diving into cold water. 
It’s called the mammalian dive reflex. This is an anatomi-
cal response we share with other mammals that have a 
superior dive reflex to ours, such as whales and seals. At 
least three things happen to your body when you are 
submerged in water that is less than 68 degrees F, or 21 de-
grees C. The purpose appears to be the body’s conservation 
of oxygen for the brain and heart, which are more sensi-
tive to a sudden anaerobic environment than the skeletal 
muscles controlling your arms and legs, for instance. The 
three things that occur are:
• Bradycardia, or a slow-beating heart. Your heart rate 
slows by up to 25 percent, so if you have a resting heart 
rate of 60, it drops to 45 beats per minute. Before you 
panic, coffee or caffeine also slows the heart rate, while 
increasing blood pressure.
• Vasoconstriction of capillaries. Blood flow to the extrem-
ities begins to shut down in order to reserve blood and 
oxygen for the internal organs such as the brain and 
heart. First the fingers and toes go numb, then hands 
and feet, and gradually the arms and legs become 
pretty useless in extreme cold water. This vasoconstric-
tion can also raise the blood pressure dangerously in 
people who have heart issues.
• A blood shift occurs, but only during deep dives. Blood 
plasma fills the lungs’ alveoli, returning to normal 
upon the diver’s reemergence at the water surface and 
within dry-land air pressure.7
In humans, the dive reflex is thought to be the reason 
some people have survived for extraordinary periods of 
time (especially children) when accidentally submerged in 
cold water (particularly compared with trying to hold your 
breath for a similar period of time on land).
Tools
The most obvious tool for swimming in cold water is a triathlon wetsuit, 
although this might actually be too efficient (because you don’t get cold 
enough to enjoy the benefits of hormesis). Buying a wetsuit without the 
arm coverings might decrease your body temperature a little more during 
a cold swim, but that’s a consideration only for the purpose of this chapter’s 
discussion of cold-water benefits. Obviously, the typical function of a good 
wetsuit is to keep you warmer in most other circumstances.
I did a one-mile triathlon swim in New Hampshire once, when the 
water was 62 degrees F (and the air was 59 degrees F). My wetsuit was 
cut off at the shoulders, so my arms weren’t covered, and I was never 
cold except for the first minute or so. I was also wearing a swim hat 
and goggles.

I use a pool thermometer before I decide to jump into a cold river in the early 
or late spring. Figure 11-1 shows the thermometer—just dip the blue part 
into the water, tie it off to something like a stick or branch, and leave it in 
there for a minute or two. As a safety precaution, you can use the list of tips 
from this website on the effects of different temperatures on your ability to 
survive in cold water: http://www.shipwrite.bc.ca/Chilling_truth.htm.

More tips for cold-water immersion:
• If you’re doing winter or early-spring swimming, you might find a club 
of people with like interests. This means you have people around when 
you’re doing a swim, especially the first time, just in case.
• Make sure your swimming spot doesn’t include any other potential dif-
ficulties like tricky currents or unknown depths (this isn’t the time for 
cliff jumping!). It should be very easy swimming so you can focus on 
adapting to the water temperature.
• Have a goal in mind, such as a rock a few meters away. If the water’s 
really cold, swim in sprint form for a few strokes as you warm up in the 
chill environment. It also helps to swim in cold shallow water, like in a 
river or stream without much depth, so you can stand up whenever you 
want and warm up.

• Have a place and clothes to get warm quickly after a cold-weather or 
winter swim. It’s not necessarily the swim that will cause hypothermia (a 
potentially fatal drop in body temperature); it’s the inability to get warm 
after emerging from the water, for the next 15 to 30 minutes. Make sure 
you have a towel and plenty of clothing layers for after the swim, and 
that shelter, your car, or the like is nearby.
• By far the easiest way to take advantage of hormesis and cold water, 
and one that is also effective, if less adventurous and gratifying, is a cold 
shower. The shower is more convenient than going to a swimming hole 
and allows you to gradually adapt to cooler temperatures. The shower/
sauna combination, and going back and forth between the two in a 
single session, is the simplest way to expose yourself to cold and heat 
stress. Stay in the sauna until you’re hot, then take a cold shower (at this 
point, it’s less of a shock than relief), then get back into the sauna again. 
It feels great!
A number of websites can provide up-to-date water temperatures so you 
can determine whether the water is too cold or just right for a bit of hor-
metic swimming. This site provides maps showing the water temperature in 
the ocean throughout the east and west coasts of the United States: www.
nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/natl_tmap.html.
Simply walking in the cold is healthy. I can’t prove it or cite studies, but hey, 
perhaps cold-weather hiking or Nordic walking provides a hormetic effect. 
You’re exposing yourself to a cold stress, but a manageable one if you’ve 
dressed appropriately (in layers, using wind-resistant materials and fibers 
that are designed to retain warmth, such as SmartWool). You may also burn 
more calories than usual, as your body seeks to keep its internal temperature 
stable. When you generate heat internally, but are not yet shivering, this 
state is called non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). The liberation of fats from 
your storage depots (lipolysis) is one of the sources of energy for NST.8

Sometimes things happen coincidentally, and at other times they 
have a cause-and-effect relationship. Keep your eyes open concerning 
what works, fitness-wise. My son recently had an upper-respiratory 
infection (URI), a “hack” that wouldn’t go away, for weeks. Then he 
went skiing in Vermont for more than two weeks. He skied 14 out of 16 
days. By around the beginning of the second week, the infection had 
gone away completely. Did the cold-weather exposure have a hor-
metic effect, strengthening his immune system? What gives? I thought 
cold, dry air was bad for the lungs. Continuous exposure to the cold 
and being outside, often in the sun, seems a healthy way to deal with 
cold-weather climates, and better than shrinking from the outdoors in 
artificially warmed environments all day. 
Bring a pair of trekking poles on winter walks if you live in the northern 
climes to help deal with the snow and ice, as in Nordic walking.
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy is a recent term for using extreme cold for medical purposes, 
but people have been icing their aches and pains for what seems like gen-
erations now. Beyond hormesis, cold-water immersion and swimming are 
very effective at reducing inflammation. The inflammation could be caused 
by arthritis or simply overexertion. 
I have swum in the Walensee, a large lake about 70 kilometers from 
Zurich in Switzerland, a number of different times after hard hiking 
in the steep Alps. I’d be pretty banged up after the hikes, but I would 
always feel great, all inflammation having subsided, after these 
swims. I presumed the lake contained some magic mixture of miner-
als, when it was probably the water’s cool temperatures that took 
care of the inflammation. Even in June through August, the lake water 
would often be only in the high 50s to 60s F, or 14 to 20 C.

Adaptive Thermogenesis in the Cold Mighvt Affect Your Body-Fat 
Levels
We’ve discussed in this book how little things matter with 
fitness. For example, if you move around a lot to the tune of 
six miles per day compared with someone else’s three (even 
if that doesn’t equate to more formal exercise, just informal 
movement throughout a day), you’re burning roughly 200 
more calories per day than that person. That’s 73,000 calo-
ries in a year, or about 21 pounds of stored calories, or fat. 
A 2010 study in the Obesity journal found that the way 
people responded to a cold environment tended to differ 
depending on whether they were overweight or not (www.
nature.com/oby/journal/v18/n6/full/oby201074a.html). 
In the study, titled “Cold-Induced Adaptive Thermogenesis 
in Lean and Obese,” researchers took a group of people and 
had them live in a temperature-controlled chamber for a 
few days. During the first part of the stay, the chamber was 
kept at 72 degrees F, or 22 C, and they cooled the chamber 
to 61 degrees F, or 16 degrees C, during the second part 
of this sequestered study. That’s actually not very cold; my 
house during the winter is barely kept at 60 degrees F. I 
don’t like paying utility bills, and when in Vermont, which is 
a lot of the time, I sleep at 50 degrees F). 
During the study, researchers tested various parameters like 
total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), skin temperature, 
and hormone levels.
They found that the lean subjects tended to increase their 
activity levels to maintain warmth in the cooled envi-
ronment, but the obese did not. This is called adaptive 
thermogenesis, representing the combination of behaviors 
and physiological effects that take place to keep one warm 
when a room is cold. 
The study pointed out that “Energy Expenditure (EE) in the 
cold increased significantly in the lean subjects, but did 
not in the obese subjects. In both groups, interindividual 
differences in EE changes were large….” Some people just 
move around more in the cold, and they tend to be leaner 
to begin with.
The study also pointed out that the obese subjects had 
more insulation (their body fat, obviously). They therefore 
required less physical activity to deal with the cooler room 
temperatures. The authors speculated that modern life 
involves too little variability in room temperatures (we keep 
office and house temperatures too warm and static despite 
what’s going on outside, in most cases). The baking room 
temperatures where we work and live probably contrib-
ute to people falling out of shape, because there is little 
motivation to move around and develop adaptations to the 
temperature. In other words, blasting the heat all the time 
inside is not only expensive from an energy standpoint, but 
it doesn’t contribute to health in the long run.
Sports recovery and the use of cryotherapy has gone high tech, as an 
article about soccer players in England describes. The players enter special 
chambers in which the temperature can drop below –200 F (www.dailymail.
co.uk/sport/football/article-1335496/How-hot-Spurs-stay-cool-Rafael-van-der-
Vaart-finds-ice-easy-way-recover-hamstring-injury.html).
This kind of therapy is called whole-body cryotherapy (WBC), and it’s used to 
relieve pain and improve the healing of injuries. A number of studies have 
been implemented to determine the effects of very short-term exposure to 
extreme cold (such as 20-second winter swims versus 2 minutes of WBC).9

Exercise Stress
Exercise itself is a form of stress—particularly short-term, high-intensity 
exercise, which Chapters 7 and 8 cover in depth. Exercise is hormesis; the 
body will respond to the short-term intensity or the gradual demands of 
moderate endurance exercise with positive adaptations, such as a stronger 
musculature (as with weightlifting) and even improvements in the way your 
hormonal or endocrine systems function. 
According to our originally quoted scientific article (“Mimetics of Hormetic 
Agents: Stress-Resistance Triggers”), exercise is a hormetic agent that trig-
gers positive gene expression.
In other words, exercise will trigger signaling pathways that make you meta-
bolically more efficient, as long as you don’t overdo it (the positive adapta-
tions of training are dose-dependent, like other forms of hormesis, which are 
toxic when they involve excessive doses).
For example, one study that reviewed the evidence for hormesis and exer-
cise pointed out that moderate running had benefits at the muscular and 
skeletal levels. These included increased antioxidant capacity in the muscles 
and improved bone strength, whereas higher-intensity running for long 
periods catabolized, or broke down, muscles and led to reduced bone-
mineral density (these studies were performed on rodents).10
This review also pointed out a number of dose-dependent effects (meaning 
too much treadmill running had a bad rather than beneficial effect) with 
several internal organ systems.
For example: “Moderate exercise increases pancreatic volume and β-cell 
mass… and reduces circulating insulin levels, indicative of enhanced insulin 
sensitivity” (which is a good thing).11
The bottom line is, if you’ve never heard of hormesis before and you are 
training strategically, as in aiming for resistance training and/or moderate 
endurance exercise, then you’ve already been doing it!
Caloric Restriction and Fasting
Intermittent fasting (IF) is itself a stress to the system and hormetic. Chapter 
6 includes a detailed discussion of the existing research on the benefits of IF. 
Caloric restriction (CR) is different than fasting—it involves a chronic, not just 
temporary or intermittent, reduction of calories consumed per day, by up to 
40 percent. In other words, a typical diet for a male American involving 3,200 
calories per day would drop to 1,920, and a female’s intake of 2,000 calories 
per day would be reduced to 1,200 calories.
Exercise is hormesis; the body 
will respond to the  
short-term intensity or the 
gradual demands of  
moderate endurance exercise 
with positive adaptations, such 
as a stronger musculature (as 
with weightlifting) and even 
improvements in the way your 
hormonal or endocrine systems 
function.

Hormesis
CR is one of the few proven life-extension strategies for laboratory animals 
such as rats (lab experiments using CR have significantly increased lifespan, 
in the realm of 25 percent).12 
IF is quite easy to integrate into your lifestyle. Chapter 6 includes several 
recommendations for making short-term fasts (up to 16 hours) a part of 
your routine. 
CR, however, despite the positive lab results and hormetic effects (in stud-
ies), is difficult and enervating for most people. In a word, it’s like starvation. 
This eating (or noneating) strategy provides very little energy for making 
athletic gains or putting some additional lean mass on your body.
Assorted Hormetic Activities
Having one drink periodically may have a hormetic effect, according to the 
journal article “Mimetics of Hormetic Agents: Stress-Resistance Triggers”:
The cardio-protective advantage of moderate consumption of etha-
nol in popular beverages [the so-called “French Paradox”] may 
result from ethanol-induced favorable changes in lipid metabolism, 
antioxidant effects, changes in homeostasis and platelet aggrega-
tion, arterial vasodilatation mediated by NO release, expression of 
cardio-protective proteins, insulin sensitization and lower levels of 
inflammatory markers.
In humans, a beneficial induction of plasma antioxidants is achieved 
with one drink (5% v/v alcohol) while an increased prooxidant 
state occurs after three drinks from volunteers averaged over 360 
minutes. One drink of red wine, beer, or stout provided equivalent 
increases in plasma antioxidant activity without induction of pro-
oxidative stress…. Thus, at different doses, different physiological 
responses occur from benefit to harmful response.13
Translation: one drink, such as a glass of wine or beer, might be good for you, 
but no more than that can really be called hormesis.
Is being scared or at a heightened level of alert for a short period of time horme-
sis? You could make an argument for it. The short-term fear elicited by, for 
example, a bungee jump or a trek or hunt in grizzly-bear country (Montana 
or Wyoming) seems to provide the same “rush” as similar high-intensity 
physical states. The resulting sensation is one of a heightened sense of 
connection with your surroundings (like the discussion in Chapter 7 of the 
Scandinavian concept of friluftsliv), and of all your senses acquiring a greater 
level of acuity. 
One drink, such as a glass of 
wine or beer, might be good  
for you.

Could this short-lived stress be good for you, as opposed to the chronic, 
thousand little stresses of a typical day lived in the Digital Age (e.g., you’re 
late for the school pickup, you’re behind on deadlines, you don’t get along 
with your boss, someone’s posted something sociopathic on your Facebook 
wall, and you’re getting subtle slights from the nearby cubicle guy…)? Yeah, 
I know, this brief discussion is unscientific and unproven, but it’s nonetheless 
worth exploring. Maybe one way we stay fitter is by never ceasing to pursue 
the natural, ultimate high. Go ahead, challenge yourself. Never stop.
Sports Massage
I included sports massage in this chapter as a legitimate health tweak for 
people who lift weights, hikes, climbs, skis, bikes, or takes part in a team 
sport that leaves you stiff, banged up, and with possible overuse issues. 
There is some controversy about whether sports massage is more art than 
science, and you can delve into that discussion by searching Google Scholar 
for “sports massage.” 
I think there is a good physiological basis for using an experienced sports 
massage therapist to increase blood flow and help repair damaged muscle 
fibers, and I can personally attest to its benefits after getting numerous 
pre- and after-race massages from Sports Massage Pro (www.sportsmas-
sagepro.com). Another important consideration is who is doing the massage. 
Neurosurgery is a highly technical procedure with a scientific basis, but the 
more subjective consideration of who is actually performing the surgery is 
critical too.
Check out this rather lengthy review of some of the science on sports mas-
sage in the British Journal of Sports Medicine: http://msscentershop.info/con-
tent/28/3/153.full.pdf+html/. 
Even if sports massage is more art than science (and I don’t think it is, but 
for the sake of argument)…so what, if it works? I once had what I thought 
was a painful calf tear that lasted more than a week, and was with me for the 
entire second half of a long duathlon (a race that is a run-bike-run sandwich). 
I went into Christine’s office (see the sidebar on sports massage), she “untied” 
the knotted calf muscle, and it was completely gone when I walked out of 
the room. 
After that encounter with the sports-massage technique, I was hooked. It 
seemed so practical. A massage for specific (a muscle or joint problem) or 
nonspecific purposes will help you recover from hard physical efforts, as well 
as prepare you for the same kind of activities. 
I usually get a deep tissue massage if I don’t have any issues, such as niggling 
soreness or injuries, because the latter technique can kind of hurt in spots 
(hormesis?). There are numerous kinds of sports massage, from deep tissue 
to Swedish to Shiatsu. Many insurance programs will cover massage, so check 
with your own provider.
Maybe one way we stay fitter is 
by never ceasing to pursue the 
natural, ultimate high.  
Go ahead, challenge yourself.

Insights from a Sports Massage Expert
I interviewed Christine Misiano, a 
wonderful lady who has several 
decades’ worth of sports-mas-
sage expertise, mostly in the 
Newburyport, Massachusetts 
area. She runs Sports Massage 
Pro (www.sportsmassagepro.
com).
What originally inspired your interest in becoming a sports-
massage expert?
After being in the massage field for many years I began to 
realize an affinity toward solving the muscular problems 
among athletes. I love working with this group of people, 
because of their proactive attitude when it comes to health 
and fitness. Working with the body and its repair is also like 
a puzzle—challenging and rewarding at the same time. To 
have my clients leave my office feeling calmer and more 
confident is an amazing job perk!
What are the physical benefits of sports massage?
Sports massage is derived from Swedish massage. From 
a physical basis, it is designed to stimulate the flow of 
lymphatic fluid, improve blood circulation overall, improve 
flexibility by stretching and broadening shortened muscles 
and breaking up scar tissue, as well as in general prevent 
injuries and help heal injured muscles and tendons. 
What’s the typical feedback from your athletes?
The typical result of the massage is that the athlete feels 
relief, has a considerably better range of motion, and [has] 
less pain, stress, and tightness. My job is awesome—every-
one is happy when they leave!
What do you like most about sports massage yourself, if you’re 
the recipient?
I work out and use my body constantly. After a sports mas-
sage, I feel lighter, more flexible, and euphoric—my blood 
feels like it is flowing more freely. It’s a welcome release. 
Luckily I have never been issued a “Driving While Intoxi-
cated from Massage.” That’s a joke, by the way!
Conclusion
Here the book comes to an end. I’ve covered many aspects of fitness—liter-
ally as many as I could think of. I haven’t flinched from offering technical or 
scientific information, along with a little homespun wisdom cloaked in a 
veneer of empirical observation. I hope that you have found the information 
provocative. I also hope you’ve found kernels of ideas you have not found 
in other places and that they make a contribution to your own fitness. After 
all, what’s the use of a book with “fitness” in its title, if not to help make you

Now it’s your turn. Take the information and run with it, and share it judi-
ciously (meaning, don’t make a copyright violation!) with friends and loved 
ones. If you have come across something interesting that you haven’t tried 
before, experiment. If this new technique involves physical activity, espe-
cially outdoors, it can never be thought of as a waste of time.
A little analysis often helps and can lead to useful insights. I love record-
ing and digitally mapping my modest outdoor adventures with the best 
of them. But somehow I think we are living in the age of “hyperanalyzing 
everything,” particularly health and fitness. If somehow you could ask the 
elegant lynx here in the snowy northern Vermont woods how long it would

like to live (it would probably give you an inscrutable look, make a minute 
fleeting connection, and dash off into the evergreen), it might reply “forever.” 
Wild animals spend their days simply trying to survive. In a way, their brief, 
uncataloged lives are dedicated to optimizing survival, and they fit into their 
niches with a quiet perfection that we have failed to achieve. We don’t know 
how humans spend their days, because the “jury is still out.” There are no 
definitive answers. We’ve spent eons pondering the meanings of our exis-
tence, when maybe a sliver of the answer lies in the gleam of a lynx’s eyes 
before he vanishes into the snow. 
I wish you all the best in your pursuit of health. Be strong, help other people, 
and I hope you find contentment in your fitness efforts.

About the Author
Bruce W. Perry played college soccer in New York, then amidst a varied career 
in journalism and software engineering finished literally (ask his knees!) hun-
dreds of road races and multisport events. He's since moved on to family life 
and recreational alpine hiking, skiing, and resistance training. He has also writ-
ten two recent software books for O'Reilly Media. After an unguided youth, 
he now hangs out weightlifting in gyms again, and climbs with guides now, 
recently Piz Palu in the Swiss Alps, Mt. Whitney's Mountaineer's Route, and Mt. 
Rainier.
