help you learn how to study mathematics, caution you 
about common errors, address special cases, or show 
alternative or additional steps to a solution of an example.
REVISED Exercise Sets
The exercise sets have been carefully and extensively
examined to ensure they are rigorous and relevant 
and include all topics our users have suggested. The 
exercises have been reorganized and titled so you 
can better see the connections between examples and 
exercises. Multi-step, real-life exercises reinforce 
problem-solving skills and mastery of concepts by 
giving students the opportunity to apply the concepts 
in real-life situations.

Trusted Features
Applications
Carefully chosen applied exercises and examples 
are included throughout to address the question,
“When will I use this?” These applications are 
pulled from diverse sources, such as current events,
world data, industry trends, and more, and relate 
to a wide range of interests. Understanding where
calculus is (or can be) used promotes fuller under-
standing of the material.
Writing about Concepts
Writing exercises at the end of each section 
are designed to test your understanding of basic 
concepts in each section, encouraging you to 
verbalize and write answers and promote technical
communication skills that will be invaluable in 
your future careers.

Preface
Theorems
Theorems provide the conceptual framework for calculus. Theorems 
are clearly stated and separated from the rest of the text by boxes for quick 
visual reference. Key proofs often follow the theorem and can be found 
at LarsonCalculus.com.
Definitions
As with theorems, definitions are clearly 
stated using precise, formal wording and 
are separated from the text by boxes for 
quick visual reference.
Explorations
Explorations provide unique challenges 
to study concepts that have not yet been 
formally covered in the text. They allow 
you to learn by discovery and introduce 
topics related to ones presently being 
studied. Exploring topics in this way 
encourages you to think outside the box. 
Historical Notes and Biographies
Historical Notes provide you with background 
information on the foundations of calculus. 
The Biographies introduce you to the people 
who created and contributed to calculus. 
Technology
Throughout the book, technology boxes show 
you how to use technology to solve problems 
and explore concepts of calculus. These tips 
also point out some pitfalls of using technology.
Section Projects
Projects appear in selected sections and encourage 
you to explore applications related to the topics 
you are studying. They provide an interesting 
and engaging way for you and other students 
to work and investigate ideas collaboratively.
Putnam Exam Challenges
Putnam Exam questions appear in selected 
sections. These actual Putnam Exam questions 
will challenge you and push the limits of 
your understanding of calculus.

Sketch the graph of an equation.
Find the intercepts of a graph.
Test a graph for symmetry with respect to an axis and the origin.
Find the points of intersection of two graphs.
Interpret mathematical models for real-life data.
The Graph of an Equation
In 1637, the French mathematician René Descartes revolutionized the study of mathe-
matics by combining its two major fields—algebra and geometry. With Descartes’s
coordinate plane, geometric concepts could be formulated analytically and algebraic
concepts could be viewed graphically. The power of this approach was such that within
a century of its introduction, much of calculus had been developed.
The same approach can be followed in your study of calculus. That is, by viewing
calculus from multiple perspectives—graphically, analytically, and numerically—you
will increase your understanding of core concepts.
Consider the equation 
The point 
is a solution point of the
equation because the equation is satisfied (is true) when 2 is substituted for and 1 is
substituted for 
This equation has many other solutions, such as 
and 
To
find other solutions systematically, solve the original equation for 
Analytic approach
Then construct a table of values by substituting several values of 
Numerical approach
From the table, you can see that 
and 
are solutions of the original 
equation 
Like many equations, this 
equation has an infinite number of solutions. 
The set of all solution points is the graph of the 
equation, as shown in Figure P.1. Note that the 
sketch shown in Figure P.1 is referred to as 
the graph of 
even though it really 
represents only a portion of the graph. The 
entire graph would extend beyond the page.
In this course, you will study many sketching 
techniques. The simplest is point plotting—that is,
you plot points until the basic shape of the graph 
seems apparent.
Sketching a Graph by Point Plotting
To sketch the graph of 
first construct a table of values. Next, plot the points
shown in the table. Then connect the points with a smooth curve, as shown in Figure
P.2. This graph is a parabola. It is one of the conics you will study in Chapter 10.

RENÉ DESCARTES (1596–1650)
Descartes made many contribu-
tions to philosophy, science,
and mathematics.The idea of 
representing points in the plane
by pairs of real numbers and 
representing curves in the plane
by equations was described 
by Descartes in his book 
La Géométrie, published in 1637.

One disadvantage of point plotting is that to get a good idea about the shape of a
graph, you may need to plot many points. With only a few points, you could badly 
misrepresent the graph. For instance, to sketch the graph of
you plot five points:
and
as shown in Figure P.3(a). From these five points, you might conclude that the graph is
a line. This, however, is not correct. By plotting several more points, you can see that
the graph is more complicated, as shown in Figure P.3(b).

TECHNOLOGY
Graphing an equation has been made easier by technology.
Even with technology, however, it is possible to misrepresent a graph badly. For
instance, each of the graphing utility* screens in Figure P.4 shows a portion of the
graph of
From the screen on the left, you might assume that the graph is a line. From the
screen on the right, however, you can see that the graph is not a line. So, whether you
are sketching a graph by hand or using a graphing utility, you must realize that 
different “viewing windows” can produce very different views of a graph. In choosing
a viewing window, your goal is to show a view of the graph that fits well in the 
context of the problem.

Intercepts of a Graph
Two types of solution points that are especially useful in graphing an equation are those
having zero as their - or -coordinate. Such points are called intercepts because they
are the points at which the graph intersects the - or -axis. The point 
is an
-intercept of the graph of an equation when it is a solution point of the equation. To
find the -intercepts of a graph, let 
be zero and solve the equation for

instance, consider the four graphs shown in Figure P.5.

TECHNOLOGY
Example 2
uses an analytic approach to
finding intercepts. When an 
analytic approach is not possible,
you can use a graphical
approach by finding the points
at which the graph intersects 
the axes. Use the trace feature 
of a graphing utility to approxi-
mate the intercepts of the graph
of the equation in Example 2.
Note that your utility may 
have a built-in program that 
can find the -intercepts of a
graph. (Your utility may call 
this the root or zero feature.) 
If so, use the program to find
the -intercepts of the graph 
of the equation in Example 2.

Symmetry of a Graph
Knowing the symmetry of a graph before attempting to sketch it is useful because you
need only half as many points to sketch the graph. The three types of symmetry listed
below can be used to help sketch the graphs of equations (see Figure P.7).
1. A graph is symmetric with respect to the -axis if, whenever 
is a point on the
graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the portion of the
graph to the left of the axis is a mirror image of the portion to the right of the axis.
2. A graph is symmetric with respect to the 
axis if, whenever 
is a point on the
graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the portion of the
graph below the 
axis is a mirror image of the portion above the 
axis.
3. A graph is symmetric with respect to the origin if, whenever 
is a point on
the graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the graph is
unchanged by a rotation of 
about the origin.
The graph of a polynomial has symmetry with respect to the axis when each term
has an even exponent (or is a constant). For instance, the graph of
has symmetry with respect to the 
axis. Similarly, the graph of a polynomial has
symmetry with respect to the origin when each term has an odd exponent, as illustrated
in Example 3.
Testing for Symmetry
Test the graph of 
for symmetry with respect to (a) the -axis and (b) the
origin.
Solution
a.
Write original equation.
Replace by 
Simplify. It is not an equivalent equation.
Because replacing by 
does not yield an equivalent equation, you can conclude
that the graph of 
is not symmetric with respect to the -axis.
b.
Write original equation.
Replace by 
and by 
Simplify.
Equivalent equation
Because replacing 
by 
and 
by 
yields an equivalent equation, you can 
conclude that the graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the origin, as
shown in Figure P.8.

axis because replacing 
by
yields an equivalent equation.
Write original equation.
Replace by 
Equivalent equation
This means that the portion of the graph below the 
axis is a mirror image of the
portion above the 
axis. To sketch the graph, first plot the -intercept and the points
above the 
axis. Then reflect in the 
axis to obtain the entire graph, as shown in 
Figure P.9.
Points of Intersection
A point of intersection of the graphs of two equations is a point that satisfies both
equations. You can find the point(s) of intersection of two graphs by solving their
equations simultaneously.

Solution
Begin by sketching the graphs of both equations in the same rectangular

Mathematical Models
Real-life applications of mathematics often use equations as mathematical models. In
developing a mathematical model to represent actual data, you should strive for two
(often conflicting) goals: accuracy and simplicity. That is, you want the model to be
simple enough to be workable, yet accurate enough to produce meaningful results.
Section P.4 explores these goals more completely.
Comparing Two Mathematical Models
The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii records the carbon dioxide concentration (in
parts per million) in Earth’s atmosphere. The January readings for various years are
shown in Figure P.11. In the July 1990 issue of Scientific American, these data were
used to predict the carbon dioxide level in Earth’s atmosphere in the year 2035, using
the quadratic model
Quadratic model for 1960–1990 data
where 
represents 1960, as shown in Figure P.11(a). The data shown in 
Figure P.11(b) represent the years 1980 through 2010 and can be modeled by
Linear model for 1980–2010 data
where 
represents 1960. What was the prediction given in the Scientific American
article in 1990? Given the new data for 1990 through 2010, does this prediction for the
year 2035 seem accurate?
(a)
(b)
Figure P.11
Solution
To answer the first question, substitute 
(for 2035) into the quadratic
model.
Quadratic model
So, the prediction in the Scientific American article was that the carbon dioxide
concentration in Earth’s atmosphere would reach about 470 parts per million in the year
2035. Using the linear model for the 1980–2010 data, the prediction for the year 2035 is
Linear model
So, based on the linear model for 1980–2010, it appears that the 1990 prediction was
too high.
The models in Example 6 were developed using a procedure called least squares
regression (see Section 13.9). The quadratic and linear models have correlations given
by 
and 
respectively. The closer 
is to 1, the “better” the model.

Write equations of lines that are parallel or perpendicular to a given line.
The Slope of a Line
The slope of a nonvertical line is a measure of the number of units the line rises (or
falls) vertically for each unit of horizontal change from left to right. Consider the two
points 
and 
on the line in Figure P.12. As you move from left to right
along this line, a vertical change of
Change in 
units corresponds to a horizontal change of
Change in 
units. (
is the Greek uppercase letter delta, and the symbols 
and 
are read “delta
” and “delta .”)
When using the formula for slope, note that
So, it does not matter in which order you subtract as long as you are consistent and both
“subtracted coordinates” come from the same point.
Figure P.13 shows four lines: one has a positive slope, one has a slope of zero, one
has a negative slope, and one has an “undefined” slope. In general, the greater the
absolute value of the slope of a line, the steeper the line. For instance, in Figure P.13,
the line with a slope of 
is steeper than the line with a slope of 1

Equations of Lines
Any two points on a nonvertical line can be used to calculate its slope. This can be
verified from the similar triangles shown in Figure P.14. (Recall that the ratios of
corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.)

Ratios and Rates of Change
The slope of a line can be interpreted as either a ratio or a rate. If the 
and axes have
the same unit of measure, then the slope has no units and is a ratio. If the 
and axes 
have different units of measure, then the slope is a rate or rate of change. In your study
of calculus, you will encounter applications involving both interpretations of slope.
Using Slope as a Ratio
The maximum recommended slope of a wheelchair ramp is 
A business installs a
wheelchair ramp that rises to a height of 22 inches over a length of 24 feet, as shown in
Figure P.16. Is the ramp steeper than recommended?
(Source: ADA Standards for
Accessible Design)
Figure P.16
Solution
The length of the ramp is 24 feet or 
inches. The slope of the
ramp is the ratio of its height (the rise) to its length (the run).
Because the slope of the ramp is less than 
the ramp is not steeper than 
recommended. Note that the slope is a ratio and has no units.
Using Slope as a Rate of Change
The population of Colorado was about 4,302,000 in 2000 and about 5,029,000 in 2010.
Find the average rate of change of the population over this 10-year period. What will
the population of Colorado be in 2020?
(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)
Solution
Over this 10-year period, the average rate of change of the population of
Colorado was
Assuming that Colorado’s population continues to increase at this same rate for the next 
10 years, it will have a 2020 population of about 5,756,000 (see Figure P.17).
The rate of change found in Example 3 is an average rate of change. An average
rate of change is always calculated over an interval. In this case, the interval is 
In Chapter 2, you will study another type of rate of change called an
instantaneous rate of change.

Graphing Linear Models
Many problems in coordinate geometry can be classified into two basic categories.
1. Given a graph (or parts of it), find its equation.
2. Given an equation, sketch its graph.
For lines, problems in the first category can be solved by using the point-slope form. 
The point-slope form, however, is not especially useful for solving problems in the 
second category. The form that is better suited to sketching the graph of a line is the
slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.
Sketching Lines in the Plane
Sketch the graph of each equation.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. Because 
the intercept is 
Because the slope is 
you know that
the line rises two units for each unit it moves to the right, as shown in Figure P.18(a).
b. By writing the equation 
in slope-intercept form
you can see that the slope is 
and the 
intercept is 
Because the slope
is zero, you know that the line is horizontal, as shown in Figure P.18(b).
c. Begin by writing the equation in slope-intercept form.
Write original equation.
Isolate 
term on the left.
Slope-intercept form
In this form, you can see that the intercept is 
and the slope is 
This
means that the line falls one unit for every three units it moves to the right, as shown
in Figure P.18(c).

In mathematics,
the phrase “if and only if” is a
way of stating two implications
in one statement. For instance,
the first statement at the right

lines are parallel, then their
slopes are equal.
b. If two distinct nonvertical
lines have equal slopes,
then they are parallel.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
The slope of a line will appear distorted if you use
different tick-mark spacing on the - and -axes. For instance, the graphing utility
screens in Figures P.21(a) and P.21(b) both show the lines
and
Because these lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals, they must be 
perpendicular. In Figure P.21(a), however, the lines don’t appear to be perpendicular
because the tick-mark spacing on the -axis is not the same as that on the -axis. In
Figure P.21(b), the lines appear perpendicular because the tick-mark spacing on the
axis is the same as on the 
axis. This type of viewing window is said to have a
square setting.

Use function notation to represent and evaluate a function.
Find the domain and range of a function.
Sketch the graph of a function.
Identify different types of transformations of functions.
Classify functions and recognize combinations of functions.
Functions and Function Notation
A relation between two sets

where is a member of

A function from

between

that has the property that any two ordered pairs with the same -value
also have the same -value. The variable 
is the independent variable, and the

Functions can be specified in a variety of ways. In this text, however, you will 
concentrate primarily on functions that are given by equations involving the dependent

the independent variable. To
evaluate this function (that is, to find the -value that corresponds to a given -value),
it is convenient to isolate on the left side of the equation.

FUNCTION NOTATION
The word function was first used
by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in
1694 as a term to denote any
quantity connected with a curve,
such as the coordinates of a point
on a curve or the slope of a
curve. Forty years later, Leonhard
Euler used the word “function” to
describe any expression made up
of a variable and some constants.
He introduced the notation
y  fx.

The Domain and Range of a Function
The domain of a function can be described explicitly, or it may be described implicitly
by an equation used to define the function. The implied domain is the set of all real
numbers for which the equation is defined, whereas an explicitly defined domain is one
that is given along with the function. For example, the function
has an explicitly defined domain given by 
On the other hand, the
function
has an implied domain that is the set 
Finding the Domain and Range of a Function
a. The domain of the function
is the set of all -values for which 
which is the interval 
To 
find the range, observe that 
is never negative. So, the range is the 
interval 
as shown in Figure P.23(a).
b. The domain of the tangent function
is the set of all -values such that
is an integer.
Domain of tangent function
The range of this function is the set of all real numbers, as shown in Figure P.23(b).

So, the 
domain is the set of all real numbers. On the 
portion of the domain for which 
the 
function behaves as in Example 2(a). For

the range of the function is the interval 
(See Figure P.24.)
A function from 
to 
is one-to-one when to each -value in the range there
corresponds exactly one -value in the domain. For instance, the function in Example
2(a) is one-to-one, whereas the functions in Examples 2(b) and 3 are not one-to-one. A
function from 
to 
is onto when its range consists of all of Y.

That is, a graph in the coordinate plane is the graph of a function of if
and only if no vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point. For example, in

Transformations of Functions
Some families of graphs have the same basic shape. For example, compare the graph of
with the graphs of the four other quadratic functions shown in Figure P.28.

(b) Horizontal shift to the left
(c) Reflection
(d) Shift left, reflect, and shift upward

Each of the graphs in Figure P.28 is a transformation of the graph of 
The
three basic types of transformations illustrated by these graphs are vertical shifts,
horizontal shifts, and reflections. Function notation lends itself well to describing 
transformations of graphs in the plane. For instance, using

these equations.

Classifications and Combinations of Functions
The modern notion of a function is derived from the efforts of many seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century mathematicians. Of particular note was Leonhard Euler, who 
introduced the function notation 
By the end of the eighteenth century,
mathematicians and scientists had concluded that many real-world phenomena could be
represented by mathematical models taken from a collection of functions called 
elementary functions. Elementary functions fall into three categories.
1. Algebraic functions (polynomial, radical, rational)
2. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, and so on)
3. Exponential and logarithmic functions
You can review the trigonometric functions in Appendix C. The other nonalgebraic
functions, such as the inverse trigonometric functions and the exponential and logarithmic
functions, are introduced in Chapter 5.
The most common type of algebraic function is a polynomial function
where 
is a nonnegative integer. The numbers 
are coefficients, with 
the leading
coefficient and 
the constant term of the polynomial function. If 
then 
is
the degree of the polynomial function. The zero polynomial 
is not assigned 
a degree. It is common practice to use subscript notation for coefficients of general
polynomial functions, but for polynomial functions of low degree, these simpler forms
are often used. Note that 
Zeroth degree:
Constant function
First degree:
Linear function
Second degree:
Quadratic function
Third degree:
Cubic function
Although the graph of a nonconstant polynomial function can have several turns,
eventually the graph will rise or fall without bound as 
moves to the right or left.
Whether the graph of
eventually rises or falls can be determined by the function’s degree (odd or even) and
by the leading coefficient 
as indicated in Figure P.29. Note that the dashed portions
of the graphs indicate that the Leading Coefficient Test determines only the right and
left behavior of the graph.

LEONHARD EULER (1707–1783)
In addition to making major 
contributions to almost every
branch of mathematics, Euler was
one of the first to apply calculus
to real-life problems in physics.
His extensive published writings
include such topics as shipbuilding,
acoustics, optics, astronomy,
mechanics, and magnetism.

Just as a rational number can be written as the quotient of two integers, a rational
function can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Specifically, a function is
rational when it has the form
where 
and 
are polynomials.
Polynomial functions and rational functions are examples of algebraic functions.
An algebraic function of 
is one that can be expressed as a finite number of sums,
differences, multiples, quotients, and radicals involving 
For example,
is algebraic. Functions that are not algebraic are transcendental. For instance, the
trigonometric functions are transcendental.
Two functions can be combined in various ways to create new functions. For 
example, given 
and 
you can form the functions shown.

You can combine two functions in yet another way, called composition. The 
resulting function is called a composite function.

In Section P.1, an -intercept of a graph was defined to be a point 
at which
the graph crosses the -axis. If the graph represents a function then the number is a

functions, a function is even when its graph is symmetric with respect to the -axis, and

The graph of the distance 
that a student drives in a 
10-minute trip to school 
is shown in the figure. 
Give a verbal description 
of the characteristics of the 
student’s drive to school.
42. Sketching a Graph A student who commutes 27 miles
to attend college remembers, after driving a few minutes,
that a term paper that is due has been forgotten. Driving faster
than usual, the student returns home, picks up the paper,
and once again starts toward school. Sketch a possible graph
of the student’s distance from home as a function of time.

Fitting a Linear Model to Data
A basic premise of science is that much of the physical world can be described
mathematically and that many physical phenomena are predictable. This scientific outlook
was part of the scientific revolution that took place in Europe during the late 1500s. Two
early publications connected with this revolution were On the Revolutions of the
Heavenly Spheres by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus and On the Fabric of
the Human Body by the Belgian anatomist Andreas Vesalius. Each of these books was
published in 1543, and each broke with prior tradition by suggesting the use of a scientific
method rather than unquestioned reliance on authority.
One basic technique of modern science is gathering data and then describing the
data with a mathematical model. For instance, the data in Example 1 are inspired by
Leonardo da Vinci’s famous drawing that indicates that a person’s height and arm span
are equal.
Fitting a Linear Model to Data
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A class of 28 people collected the data shown below, which represent their heights 
and arm spans (rounded to the nearest inch).
Find a linear model to represent these data.
Solution
There are different ways to model these data with an equation. The
simplest would be to observe that 
and 
are about the same and list the model as
simply 
A more careful analysis would be to use a procedure from statistics called
linear regression. (You will study this procedure in Section 13.9.) The least squares
regression line for these data is
Least squares regression line
The graph of the model and the data are shown in Figure P.32. From this model, you
can see that a person’s arm span tends to be about the same as his or her height.

TECHNOLOGY
Many graphing utilities have built-in least squares regression
programs. Typically, you enter the data into the calculator and then run the linear
regression program. The program usually displays the slope and -intercept of the
best-fitting line and the correlation coefficient
The correlation coefficient gives a
measure of how well the data can be modeled by a line. The closer 
is to 1, the better
the data can be modeled by a line. For instance, the correlation coefficient for the model
in Example 1 is 
which indicates that the linear model is a good fit for the
data. If the -value is positive, then the variables have a positive correlation, as in
Example 1. If the -value is negative, then the variables have a negative correlation.

Fitting a Quadratic Model to Data
A function that gives the height of a falling object in terms of the time is called a
position function. If air resistance is not considered, then the position of a falling object
can be modeled by
where 
is the acceleration due to gravity,
is the initial velocity, and 
is the initial
height. The value of depends on where the object is dropped. On Earth,
is approxi-
mately 
feet per second per second, or 
meters per second per second.
To discover the value of experimentally, you could record the heights of a falling
object at several increments, as shown in Example 2.
Fitting a Quadratic Model to Data
A basketball is dropped from a height of about 
feet. The height of the basketball is
recorded 23 times at intervals of about 0.02 second. The results are shown in the table.
Find a model to fit these data. Then use the model to predict the time when the 
basketball will hit the ground.
Solution
Begin by sketching a scatter plot of the data, as shown in Figure P.33. From
the scatter plot, you can see that the data do not appear to be linear. It does appear,
however, that they might be quadratic. To check this, enter the data into a graphing 
utility that has a quadratic regression program. You should obtain the model

Fitting a Trigonometric Model to Data
What is mathematical modeling? This is one of the questions that is asked in the book
Guide to Mathematical Modelling. Here is part of the answer.* 
1. Mathematical modeling consists of applying your mathematical skills to obtain 
useful answers to real problems.
2. Learning to apply mathematical skills is very different from learning mathematics
itself.
3. Models are used in a very wide range of applications, some of which do not appear
initially to be mathematical in nature.
4. Models often allow quick and cheap evaluation of alternatives, leading to optimal
solutions that are not otherwise obvious.
5. There are no precise rules in mathematical modeling and no “correct” answers.
6. Modeling can be learned only by doing.
Fitting a Trigonometric Model to Data
The number of hours of daylight on a given day on Earth depends on the latitude and the
time of year. Here are the numbers of minutes of daylight at a location of 
latitude
on the longest and shortest days of the year: June 21, 801 minutes; December 22,
655 minutes. Use these data to write a model for the amount of daylight 
(in minutes)
on each day of the year at a location of 
latitude. How could you check the accuracy
of your model?
Solution
Here is one way to create a model. You can hypothesize that the model is
a sine function whose period is 365 days. Using the given data, you can conclude that
the amplitude of the graph is 
or 73. So, one possible model is
In this model,
represents the number of each day of the year, with December 22 
represented by 
A graph of this model is shown in Figure P.34. To check the 
accuracy of this model, a weather almanac was used to find the numbers of minutes of
daylight on different days of the year at the location of 
latitude.

Understand what calculus is and how it compares with precalculus.
Understand that the tangent line problem is basic to calculus.
Understand that the area problem is also basic to calculus.
What Is Calculus?
Calculus is the mathematics of change. For instance, calculus is the mathematics of
velocities, accelerations, tangent lines, slopes, areas, volumes, arc lengths, centroids,
curvatures, and a variety of other concepts that have enabled scientists, engineers, and
economists to model real-life situations.
Although precalculus mathematics also deals with velocities, accelerations, tangent
lines, slopes, and so on, there is a fundamental difference between precalculus mathe-
matics and calculus. Precalculus mathematics is more static, whereas calculus is more
dynamic. Here are some examples.
• An object traveling at a constant velocity can be analyzed with precalculus
mathematics. To analyze the velocity of an accelerating object, you need calculus.
• The slope of a line can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze the
slope of a curve, you need calculus.
• The curvature of a circle is constant and can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics.
To analyze the variable curvature of a general curve, you need calculus.
• The area of a rectangle can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze the
area under a general curve, you need calculus.
Each of these situations involves the same general strategy—the reformulation of
precalculus mathematics through the use of a limit process. So, one way to answer the
question “What is calculus?” is to say that calculus is a “limit machine” that involves
three stages. The first stage is precalculus mathematics, such as the slope of a line or
the area of a rectangle. The second stage is the limit process, and the third stage is a new
calculus formulation, such as a derivative or integral.
Some students try to learn calculus as if it were simply a collection of new
formulas. This is unfortunate. If you reduce calculus to the memorization of differenti-
ation and integration formulas, you will miss a great deal of understanding,
self-confidence, and satisfaction.
On the next two pages are listed some familiar precalculus concepts coupled with
their calculus counterparts. Throughout the text, your goal should be to learn how 
precalculus formulas and techniques are used as building blocks to produce the more
general calculus formulas and techniques. Don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with some
of the “old formulas” listed on the next two pages—you will be reviewing all of them.
As you proceed through this text, come back to this discussion repeatedly. Try 
to keep track of where you are relative to the three stages involved in the study of 
calculus. For instance, note how these chapters relate to the three stages.

REMARK
As you progress
through this course, remember
that learning calculus is just 
one of your goals. Your most
important goal is to learn how 
to use calculus to model and
solve real-life problems. Here
are a few problem-solving
strategies that may help you.
• Be sure you understand the
question. What is given? 
What are you asked to find?
• Outline a plan. There are 
many approaches you could
use: look for a pattern, solve 
a simpler problem, work 
backwards, draw a diagram,
use technology, or any of
many other approaches.
• Complete your plan. Be 
sure to answer the question.
Verbalize your answer. For
example, rather than writing
the answer as 
it
would be better to write the
answer as, “The area of the
region is 4.6 square meters.”
• Look back at your work. 
Does your answer make 
sense? Is there a way you 
can check the reasonableness
of your answer?

The Tangent Line Problem
The notion of a limit is fundamental to the study of calculus. The following brief
descriptions of two classic problems in calculus—the tangent line problem and the area
problem—should give you some idea of the way limits are used in calculus.
In the tangent line problem, you are given a function and a point 
on its graph
and are asked to find an equation of the tangent line to the graph at point 
as shown
in Figure 1.1.
Except for cases involving a vertical tangent line, the problem of finding the
tangent line at a point 
is equivalent to finding the slope of the tangent line at 
You
can approximate this slope by using a line through the point of tangency and a second
point on the curve, as shown in Figure 1.2(a). Such a line is called a secant line. If
is the point of tangency and 
is a second point on the graph of 
then the slope of the secant line through these two
points can be found using precalculus and is
(a) The secant line through 
and 
(b) As 
approaches 
the secant lines
approach the tangent line.
Figure 1.2
As point 
approaches point 
the slopes of the secant lines approach the slope of
the tangent line, as shown in Figure 1.2(b). When such a “limiting position” exists, the
slope of the tangent line is said to be the limit of the slopes of the secant lines. (Much
more will be said about this important calculus concept in Chapter 2.)

The Area Problem
In the tangent line problem, you saw how the limit process can be applied to the slope
of a line to find the slope of a general curve. A second classic problem in calculus is
finding the area of a plane region that is bounded by the graphs of functions. This 
problem can also be solved with a limit process. In this case, the limit process is applied
to the area of a rectangle to find the area of a general region.
As a simple example, consider the region bounded by the graph of the function
the axis, and the vertical lines 
and 
as shown in Figure 1.3. You
can approximate the area of the region with several rectangular regions, as shown in
Figure 1.4. As you increase the number of rectangles, the approximation tends
to become better and better because the amount of area missed by the rectangles
decreases. Your goal is to determine the limit of the sum of the areas of the rectangles
as the number of rectangles increases without bound.

HISTORICAL NOTE
In one of the most astounding
events ever to occur in mathe-
matics, it was discovered that 
the tangent line problem and the
area problem are closely related.
This discovery led to the birth of
calculus.You will learn about the
relationship between these two
problems when you study the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
in Chapter 4.

Finding Limits Graphically and Numerically
Estimate a limit using a numerical or graphical approach.
Learn different ways that a limit can fail to exist.
Study and use a formal definition of limit.
An Introduction to Limits
To sketch the graph of the function
for values other than 
you can use standard curve-sketching techniques. At 
however, it is not clear what to expect. To get an idea of the behavior of the graph of 
near 
you can use two sets of 
values—one set that approaches 1 from the left
and one set that approaches 1 from the right, as shown in the table.
The graph of 
is a parabola that has a gap at the point 
as shown in 
Figure 1.5. Although 
cannot equal 1, you can move arbitrarily close to 1, and as a
result 
moves arbitrarily close to 3. Using limit notation, you can write
This is read as “the limit of 
as approaches 1 is 3.”
This discussion leads to an informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily close
to a single number 
as 
approaches 
from either side, then the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
This limit is written as

Estimating a Limit Numerically
Evaluate the function 
at several -values near 0 and use the
results to estimate the limit
Solution
The table lists the values of 
for several 
values near 0.
From the results shown in the table, you can estimate the limit to be 2. This limit is
reinforced by the graph of (see Figure 1.6).
In Example 1, note that the function is undefined at 
and yet 
appears to 
be approaching a limit as 
approaches 0. This often happens, and it is important to 
realize that the existence or nonexistence of 
at 
has no bearing on the
existence of the limit of 
as approaches 
Finding a Limit
Find the limit of 
as approaches 2, where
Solution
Because 
for all other than 
you can estimate that the limit
is 1, as shown in Figure 1.7. So, you can write
The fact that 
has no bearing on the existence or value of the limit as 
approaches 2. For instance, as approaches 2, the function
has the same limit as 
So far in this section, you have been estimating limits numerically and graphically.
Each of these approaches produces an estimate of the limit. In Section 1.3, you will
study analytic techniques for evaluating limits. Throughout the course, try to develop a
habit of using this three-pronged approach to problem solving.
1. Numerical approach
Construct a table of values.
2. Graphical approach
Draw a graph by hand or using technology.
3. Analytic approach
Use algebra or calculus.

Limits That Fail to Exist
In the next three examples, you will examine some limits that fail to exist.
Different Right and Left Behavior
Show that the limit 
does not exist.
Solution
Consider the graph of the function
In Figure 1.8 and from the definition of absolute value,
Definition of absolute value
you can see that 
So, no matter how close 
gets to 0, there will be both positive and negative 
values
that yield 
or 
Specifically, if (the lowercase Greek letter delta) is
a positive number, then for 
values satisfying the inequality 
you can 
classify the values of 
as
or
Because 
approaches a different number from the right side of 0 than it approaches
from the left side, the limit 
does not exist.
Unbounded Behavior
Discuss the existence of the limit 
Solution
Consider the graph of the function
In Figure 1.9, you can see that as approaches 0 from either the right or the left,
increases without bound. This means that by choosing 
close enough to 0, you can
force 
to be as large as you want. For instance,
will be greater than 100 when you
choose within 
of 0. That is,
Similarly, you can force 
to be greater than 1,000,000, as shown.
Because 
does not become arbitrarily close to a single number 
as approaches 0,
you can conclude that the limit does not exist.

Oscillating Behavior

Discuss the existence of the limit 
Solution
Let 
In Figure 1.10, you can see that as 
approaches 0,
oscillates between 
and 1. So, the limit does not exist because no matter how
small you choose , it is possible to choose 
and 
within 
units of 0 such that

as shown in the table.
There are many other interesting functions that have unusual limit behavior. An
often cited one is the Dirichlet function

Because this function has no limit at any real number 
it is not continuous at any real

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
When you use a graphing utility to investigate the
behavior of a function near the 
value at which you are trying to evaluate a limit,
remember that you can’t always trust the pictures that graphing utilities draw. When
you use a graphing utility to graph the function in Example 5 over an interval 
containing 0, you will most likely obtain an incorrect graph such as that shown in
Figure 1.11. The reason that a graphing utility can’t show the correct graph is that the
graph has infinitely many oscillations over any interval that contains 0.

PETER GUSTAV DIRICHLET
(1805–1859)
In the early development of 
calculus, the definition of a function
was much more restricted than it
is today, and “functions” such as
the Dirichlet function would not
have been considered.The modern
definition of function is attributed
to the German mathematician
Peter Gustav Dirichlet.

A Formal Definition of Limit
Consider again the informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily close to a 
single number 
as approaches from either side, then the limit of 
as approaches
is 
written as
At first glance, this definition looks fairly technical. Even so, it is informal because
exact meanings have not yet been given to the two phrases
“
becomes arbitrarily close to 
and
approaches 
The first person to assign mathematically rigorous meanings to these two phrases was
Augustin-Louis Cauchy. His -
definition of limit is the standard used today.
In Figure 1.12, let 
(the lowercase Greek letter epsilon) represent a (small)
positive number. Then the phrase 
becomes arbitrarily close to 
means that 
lies in the interval 
Using absolute value, you can write this as
Similarly, the phrase 
approaches 
means that there exists a positive number such
that 
lies in either the interval 
or the interval 
This fact can be 
concisely expressed by the double inequality
The first inequality
The distance between and is more than 0.
expresses the fact that 
The second inequality
is within units of 
says that is within a distance of 
Some functions do not have limits as approaches 
but those that do cannot have
two different limits as approaches 
That is, if the limit of a function exists, then the
limit is unique (see Exercise 75).

The first use of a symbol to
denote the square root can be

Mathematicians first used the

strokes.This symbol was chosen
because it resembled a lowercase
to stand for the Latin word
radix, meaning root.

substitution, try to find a function that agrees with for all other than

Dividing Out Technique
One procedure for finding a limit analytically is the dividing out technique. This 
technique involves dividing out common factors, as shown in Example 7.
Dividing Out Technique
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the limit:
Solution
Although you are taking the limit of a rational function, you cannot apply
Theorem 1.3 because the limit of the denominator is 0.
Direct substitution fails.
Because the limit of the numerator is also 0, the numerator and denominator have 
a common factor of 
So, for all 
you can divide out this factor to obtain 
Using Theorem 1.7, it follows that
Apply Theorem 1.7.
Use direct substitution.
This result is shown graphically in Figure 1.18. Note that the graph of the function 
coincides with the graph of the function 
except that the graph of has
a gap at the point 
In Example 7, direct substitution produced the meaningless fractional form 
An
expression such as 
is called an indeterminate form because you cannot (from the
form alone) determine the limit. When you try to evaluate a limit and encounter this
form, remember that you must rewrite the fraction so that the new denominator does not
have 0 as its limit. One way to do this is to divide out like factors. Another way is to use
the rationalizing technique shown on the next page.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A graphing utility can give misleading information
about the graph of a function. For instance, try graphing the function from 
Example 7
on a standard viewing window (see Figure 1.19).
On most graphing utilities, the graph appears to 
be defined at every real number. However,
because is undefined when 
you know
that the graph of has a hole at

Rationalizing Technique
Another way to find a limit analytically is the rationalizing technique, which involves
rationalizing the numerator of a fractional expression. Recall that rationalizing the
numerator means multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the
numerator. For instance, to rationalize the numerator of
multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of 
which is
Rationalizing Technique
Find the limit:
Solution
By direct substitution, you obtain the indeterminate form 
Direct substitution fails.
In this case, you can rewrite the fraction by rationalizing the numerator.
Now, using Theorem 1.7, you can evaluate the limit as shown.
A table or a graph can reinforce your conclusion that the limit is

The Squeeze Theorem
The next theorem concerns the limit of a function that is squeezed between two other
functions, each of which has the same limit at a given value, as shown in Figure 1.21.
You can see the usefulness of the Squeeze Theorem (also called the Sandwich Theorem
or the Pinching Theorem) in the proof of Theorem 1.9.

Continuity at a Point and on an Open Interval
In mathematics, the term continuous has much the same meaning as it has in everyday
usage. Informally, to say that a function is continuous at 
means that there is no
interruption in the graph of at 
That is, its graph is unbroken at 
and there are no
holes, jumps, or gaps. Figure 1.25 identifies three values of at which the graph of is
not continuous. At all other points in the interval 
the graph of is uninterrupted
and continuous.
Three conditions exist for which the graph of is not continuous at 
Figure 1.25
In Figure 1.25, it appears that continuity at 
can be destroyed by any one of
three conditions.
1. The function is not defined at 
2. The limit of 
does not exist at 
3. The limit of 
exists at 
but it is not equal to 
If none of the three conditions is true, then the function is called continuous at

Exploration
Informally, you might say
that a function is continuous
on an open interval when its
graph can be drawn with a
pencil without lifting the
pencil from the paper. Use 
a graphing utility to graph
each function on the given
interval. From the graphs,
which functions would you
say are continuous on the
interval? Do you think you
can trust the results you
obtained graphically?

Discontinuities fall into two categories: removable and 
nonremovable. A discontinuity at is called removable when can be made continuous
by appropriately defining (or redefining) 
For instance, the functions shown in
Figures 1.26(a) and (c) have removable discontinuities at

Some people may
refer to the function in Example

have found that this terminology
can be confusing. Rather than
saying that the function is 
discontinuous, we prefer to 
say that it has a discontinuity 
at x  0.

One-Sided Limits and Continuity on a Closed Interval
To understand continuity on a closed interval, you first need to look at a different type
of limit called a one-sided limit. For instance, the limit from the right (or right-hand
limit) means that 
approaches 
from values greater than 
[see Figure 1.28(a)]. This
limit is denoted as
Limit from the right
Similarly, the limit from the left (or left-hand limit) means that 
approaches 
from
values less than [see Figure 1.28(b)]. This limit is denoted as
Limit from the left
One-sided limits are useful in taking limits of functions involving radicals. For instance,
if is an even integer, then
A One-Sided Limit
Find the limit of 
as approaches 
from the right.
Solution
As shown in Figure 1.29, the limit as approaches 
from the right is
One-sided limits can be used to investigate the behavior of step functions. One
common type of step function is the greatest integer function
defined as
Greatest integer function
For instance,
and 
The Greatest Integer Function
Find the limit of the greatest integer function
as approaches 0 from the left and
from the right.
Solution
As shown in Figure 1.30, the limit as
approaches 0 from the left is
and the limit as approaches 0 from the right is
The greatest integer function has a discontinuity 
at zero because the left- and right-hand limits at 
zero are different. By similar reasoning, you 
can see that the greatest integer function has a discontinuity at any integer n.

When the limit from the left is not equal to the limit from the right, the (two-sided)
limit does not exist. The next theorem makes this more explicit. The proof of this 
theorem follows directly from the definition of a one-sided limit.
The concept of a one-sided limit allows you to extend the definition of continuity
to closed intervals. Basically, a function is continuous on a closed interval when it is
continuous in the interior of the interval and exhibits one-sided continuity at the 
endpoints. This is stated formally in the next definition.
Similar definitions can be made to cover continuity on intervals of the form 
and 
that are neither open nor closed, or on infinite intervals. For example,
is continuous on the infinite interval 
and the function
is continuous on the infinite interval

The next example shows how a one-sided limit can be used to determine the value
of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale.
Charles’s Law and Absolute Zero
On the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is the temperature 0 K. Although temperatures very
close to 0 K have been produced in laboratories, absolute zero has never been attained.
In fact, evidence suggests that absolute zero cannot be attained. How did scientists
determine that 0 K is the “lower limit” of the temperature of matter? What is absolute
zero on the Celsius scale?
Solution
The determination of absolute zero stems from the work of the French
physicist Jacques Charles (1746–1823). Charles discovered that the volume of gas at a
constant pressure increases linearly with the temperature of the gas. The table illustrates
this relationship between volume and temperature. To generate the values in the table,
one mole of hydrogen is held at a constant pressure of one atmosphere. The volume 
is approximated and is measured in liters, and the temperature is measured in degrees
Celsius.
The points represented by the table are shown 
in Figure 1.33. Moreover, by using the points 
in the table, you can determine that 
and 
are related by the linear equation
Solving for 
you get an equation for the 
temperature of the gas.
By reasoning that the volume of the gas 
can approach 0 (but can never equal or 
go below 0), you can determine that the 
“least possible temperature” is
Use direct substitution.
So, absolute zero on the Kelvin scale 0 K is approximately 
on the Celsius
scale.
The table below shows the temperatures in Example 5 converted to the Fahrenheit
scale. Try repeating the solution shown in Example 5 using these temperatures and 
volumes. Use the result to find the value of absolute zero on the Fahrenheit scale.

Properties of Continuity
In Section 1.3, you studied several properties of limits. Each of those properties yields
a corresponding property pertaining to the continuity of a function. For instance,
Theorem 1.11 follows directly from Theorem 1.2.
It is important for you to be able to recognize functions that are continuous at every
point in their domains. The list below summarizes the functions you have studied so far
that are continuous at every point in their domains.
1. Polynomial:
2. Rational:
3. Radical:
4. Trigonometric: sin
cos
tan
cot

csc
By combining Theorem 1.11 with this list, you can conclude that a wide variety of 
elementary functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
By Theorem 1.11, it follows that each of the functions below is continuous at every

Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1821.
The definition given in his text

The Intermediate Value Theorem
Theorem 1.13 is an important theorem concerning the behavior of functions that are
continuous on a closed interval.
As an example of the application of the Intermediate Value Theorem, consider a
person’s height. A girl is 5 feet tall on her thirteenth birthday and 5 feet 7 inches tall on
her fourteenth birthday. Then, for any height between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches, there
must have been a time when her height was exactly 
This seems reasonable because
human growth is continuous and a person’s height does not abruptly change from one
value to another.
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one number 
in the closed interval 
There may, of course, be more than one number such that
as shown in Figure 1.35. A function that is not continuous does not necessarily exhibit
the intermediate value property. For example, the graph of the function shown in 
Figure 1.36 jumps over the horizontal line
and for this function there is no value of in 
such that 
is continuous on

The Intermediate Value Theorem often can be used to locate the zeros of a function
that is continuous on a closed interval. Specifically, if is continuous on

at least one zero of in the closed interval

The Intermediate Value Theorem tells you that at least one number 
exists, but it does not provide a method for finding 
Such theorems are called 
existence theorems. By referring to a text on advanced calculus, you will find that 
a proof of this theorem is based on a property of real numbers called completeness. The
Intermediate Value Theorem states that for a continuous function

An Application of the IntermediateValueTheorem
Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that the polynomial function

Figure 1.37
The bisection method for approximating the real zeros of a continuous function is
similar to the method used in Example 8. If you know that a zero exists in the closed
interval 
then the zero must lie in the interval 
or 
From the sign of 
you can determine which interval contains the zero. By
repeatedly bisecting the interval, you can “close in” on the zero of the function.

10 minutes to run down. At some point on the way down, he
realizes that he passed the same place at exactly the same
time on Saturday. Prove that he is correct. [Hint: Let

Determining Infinite Limits from a Graph
Determine the limit of each function shown in Figure 1.41 as approaches 1 from the
left and from the right.
(a)
(b)
Each graph has an asymptote at 
Figure 1.41
Solution
a. When approaches 1 from the left or the right,
is a small positive number.
Thus, the quotient 
is a large positive number, and 
approaches infinity
from each side of 
So, you can conclude that
Limit from each side is infinity.
Figure 1.41(a) confirms this analysis.
b. When 
approaches 1 from the left,
is a small negative number. Thus, the 
quotient 
is a large positive number, and 
approaches infinity from
the left of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the left side is infinity.
When 
approaches 1 from the right,
is a small positive number. Thus, the
quotient 
is a large negative number, and 
approaches negative 
infinity from the right of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the right side is negative infinity.
Figure 1.41(b) confirms this analysis.

a limit. For instance, you can use a graphing utility to create a table of values to 
analyze the limit in Example 1(a), as shown in Figure 1.42.

Vertical Asymptotes
If it were possible to extend the graphs in Figure 1.41 toward positive and negative
infinity, you would see that each graph becomes arbitrarily close to the vertical line
This line is a vertical asymptote of the graph of 
(You will study other types
of asymptotes in Sections 3.5 and 3.6.)
In Example 1, note that each of the functions is a quotient and that the vertical
asymptote occurs at a number at which the denominator is 0 (and the numerator is not
0). The next theorem generalizes this observation.
Finding Vertical Asymptotes
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
a. When 
the denominator of

b. By factoring the denominator as
you can see that the denominator is 0 at 
and 
Also, because the
numerator is not 0 at these two points, you can apply Theorem 1.14 to conclude that
the graph of has two vertical asymptotes, as shown in Figure 1.43(b).
c. By writing the cotangent function in the form
you can apply Theorem 1.14 to conclude that vertical asymptotes occur at all values
of such that

as shown in Figure 1.43(c). So, the graph of
this function has infinitely many vertical asymptotes. These asymptotes occur at
where  is an integer.

The Derivative and the Tangent Line Problem
Find the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point.
Use the limit definition to find the derivative of a function.
Understand the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
The Tangent Line Problem
Calculus grew out of four major problems that European mathematicians were working
on during the seventeenth century.
1. The tangent line problem (Section 1.1 and this section)
2. The velocity and acceleration problem (Sections 2.2 and 2.3)
3. The minimum and maximum problem (Section 3.1)
4. The area problem (Sections 1.1 and 4.2)
Each problem involves the notion of a limit, and calculus can be introduced with any of
the four problems.
A brief introduction to the tangent line problem is given in Section 1.1. Although
partial solutions to this problem were given by Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665), René
Descartes (1596–1650), Christian Huygens (1629–1695), and Isaac Barrow
(1630–1677), credit for the first general solution is usually given to Isaac Newton
(1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Newton’s work on this problem
stemmed from his interest in optics and light refraction.
What does it mean to say that a line is 
tangent to a curve at a point? For a circle, the
tangent line at a point 
is the line that is 
perpendicular to the radial line at point 
as
shown in Figure 2.1.
For a general curve, however, the problem 
is more difficult. For instance, how would you
define the tangent lines shown in Figure 2.2?
You might say that a line is tangent to a curve 
at a point 
when it touches, but does not cross,
the curve at point 
This definition would work
for the first curve shown in Figure 2.2, but not
for the second. Or you might say that a line is 
tangent to a curve when the line touches or
intersects the curve at exactly one point. This
definition would work for a circle, but not for
more general curves, as the third curve in 
Figure 2.2 shows.

Essentially, the problem of finding the tangent line at a point 
boils down to the
problem of finding the slope of the tangent line at point 
You can approximate this
slope using a secant line* through the point of tangency and a second point on the
curve, as shown in Figure 2.3. If 
is the point of tangency and
is a second point on the graph of 
then the slope of the secant line through the two
points is given by substitution into the slope formula
Slope of secant line
The right-hand side of this equation is a difference quotient. The denominator 
is
the change in
and the numerator
is the change in
The beauty of this procedure is that you can obtain more and more accurate
approximations of the slope of the tangent line by choosing points closer and closer to
the point of tangency, as shown in Figure 2.4.

THE TANGENT LINE PROBLEM
In 1637, mathematician René
Descartes stated this about the
tangent line problem:
“And I dare say that this is not 
only the most useful and general
problem in geometry that I know,
but even that I ever desire to know.”

The Slope of the Graph of a Linear Function
To find the slope of the graph of 
when 
you can apply the 
definition of the slope of a tangent line, as shown.
The slope of at 
is 
as shown in Figure 2.5. Notice that the limit
definition of the slope of agrees with the definition of the slope of a line as discussed
in Section P.2.
The graph of a linear function has the same slope at any point. This is not true of
nonlinear functions, as shown in the next example.
Tangent Lines to the Graph of a Nonlinear Function
Find the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of 
at the points 
and 
as shown in Figure 2.6.
Solution
Let 
represent an arbitrary point on the graph of 
Then the slope
of the tangent line at 
can be found as shown below. [Note in the limit process
that is held constant (as 
approaches 0).]
So, the slope at any point 
on the graph of is 
At the point 
the
slope is 
and at 
the slope is 
The definition of a tangent line to a curve does not cover the possibility of a 
vertical tangent line. For vertical tangent lines, you can use the following definition. If
is continuous at and
or
then the vertical line 
passing through 
is a vertical tangent line to the
graph of 
For example, the function shown in Figure 2.7 has a vertical tangent line at
When the domain of 
is the closed interval 
you can extend the 
definition of a vertical tangent line to include the endpoints by considering continuity
and limits from the right

The Derivative of a Function
You have now arrived at a crucial point in the study of calculus. The limit used to define
the slope of a tangent line is also used to define one of the two fundamental operations
of calculus—differentiation.
Be sure you see that the derivative of a function of 
is also a function of 
This
“new” function gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at the point 
provided that the graph has a tangent line at this point. The derivative can also be used
to determine the instantaneous rate of change (or simply the rate of change) of one
variable with respect to another.
The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. A 
function is differentiable at when its derivative exists at and is differentiable on an
open interval
when it is differentiable at every point in the interval.
In addition to 
other notations are used to denote the derivative of 
The most common are
Notation for derivatives
The notation 
is read as “the derivative of 
with respect to
” or simply “
.” Using limit notation, you can write

Differentiability and Continuity
The alternative limit form of the derivative shown below is useful in investigating the
relationship between differentiability and continuity. The derivative of at is
Alternative form of derivative
provided this limit exists (see Figure 2.10).
As approaches 
the secant line 
approaches the tangent line.
Figure 2.10
Note that the existence of the limit in this alternative form requires that the one-sided
limits
and
exist and are equal. These one-sided limits are called the derivatives from the left and
from the right, respectively. It follows that is differentiable on the closed interval
when it is differentiable on 
and when the derivative from the right at and
the derivative from the left at both exist.
When a function is not continuous at 
it is also not differentiable at 
For instance, the greatest integer function
is not continuous at 
and so it is not differentiable at 
(see Figure 2.11). You
can verify this by observing that
Derivative from the left
and
Derivative from the right
Although it is true that differentiability implies continuity (as shown in Theorem 2.1 on
the next page), the converse is not true. That is, it is possible for a function to be 
continuous at 
and not differentiable at 
Examples 6 and 7 illustrate this
possibility.

A Graph with a Vertical Tangent Line
The function 
is continuous at 
as shown in Figure 2.13. However,
because the limit
is infinite, you can conclude that the tangent line is vertical at 
So,

differentiable at 
From Examples 6 and 7, you can see that a function is not differentiable at a point
at which its graph has a sharp turn or a vertical tangent line.
Proof
You can prove that is continuous at 
by showing that

To do this, use the differentiability of

following limit.
Because the difference 
approaches zero as

See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The relationship between continuity and differentiability is summarized below.
1. If a function is differentiable at 
then it is continuous at 
So, differentia-
bility implies continuity.
2. It is possible for a function to be continuous at 
and not be differentiable at
So, continuity does not imply differentiability (see Example 6).

sections, you will be introduced to several “differentiation rules” that allow you to find
derivatives without the direct use of the limit definition.

The Power Rule
Before proving the next rule, it is important to review the procedure for expanding a
binomial.
The general binomial expansion for a positive integer is
is a factor of these terms.
This binomial expansion is used in proving a special case of the Power Rule.
Proof
If is a positive integer greater than 1, then the binomial expansion produces
This proves the case for which is a positive integer greater than 1. It is left to you to prove
the case for 
Example 7 in Section 2.3 proves the case for which 
is a negative
integer. In Exercise 71 in Section 2.5, you are asked to prove the case for which 
is
rational. (In Section 5.5, the Power Rule will be extended to cover irrational values of )
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
When using the Power Rule, the case for which 
is best thought of as a
separate differentiation rule. That is,
Power Rule when 
This rule is consistent with the fact that the slope of the line 
is 1, as shown in

functions. (The derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions are discussed in
Section 2.3.)
Proof
Here is a proof of the first rule. (The proof of the second rule is left as an 
exercise [see Exercise 118].)
Definition of derivative
This differentiation rule is shown graphically in Figure 2.18. Note that for each 
the
slope of the sine curve is equal to the value of the cosine.

Rates of Change
You have seen how the derivative is used to determine slope. The derivative can also 
be used to determine the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.
Applications involving rates of change, sometimes referred to as instantaneous rates of
change, occur in a wide variety of fields. A few examples are population growth rates,
production rates, water flow rates, velocity, and acceleration.
A common use for rate of change is to describe the motion of an object moving in
a straight line. In such problems, it is customary to use either a horizontal or a vertical
line with a designated origin to represent the line of motion. On such lines, movement
to the right (or upward) is considered to be in the positive direction, and movement to
the left (or downward) is considered to be in the negative direction.
The function 
that gives the position (relative to the origin) of an object as a
function of time is called a position function. If, over a period of time 
the object
changes its position by the amount
then, by the familiar formula
the average velocity is
Average velocity
Finding Average Velocity of a Falling Object
A billiard ball is dropped from a height of 100 feet. The ball’s height at time is the

where is measured in feet and is measured in seconds. Find the average velocity over
each of the following time intervals.
a.

Solution
a. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 
feet to a height of 
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
b. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
c. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
Note that the average velocities are negative, indicating that the object is moving 
downward.

Suppose that in Example 9, you wanted to find the instantaneous velocity (or
simply the velocity) of the object when 
Just as you can approximate the slope of
the tangent line by calculating the slope of the secant line, you can approximate the
velocity at 
by calculating the average velocity over a small interval 
(see Figure 2.20). By taking the limit as 
approaches zero, you obtain the velocity
when 
Try doing this—you will find that the velocity when 
is 
feet per
second.
In general, if 
is the position function for an object moving along a straight
line, then the velocity of the object at time is
Velocity function
In other words, the velocity function is the derivative of the position function. Velocity
can be negative, zero, or positive. The speed of an object is the absolute value of its
velocity. Speed cannot be negative.
The position of a free-falling object (neglecting air resistance) under the influence
of gravity can be represented by the equation
Position function
where 
is the initial height of the object,
is the initial velocity of the object, and 
is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the value of 
is approximately 
feet
per second per second or 
meters per second per second.
Using the Derivative to Find Velocity
At time 
a diver jumps from a platform diving board that is 32 feet above the
water (see Figure 2.21). Because the initial velocity of the diver is 16 feet per second,
the position of the diver is
Position function
where is measured in feet and is measured in seconds.
a. When does the diver hit the water?
b. What is the diver’s velocity at impact?
Solution
a. To find the time when the diver hits the water, let 
and solve for .
Set position function equal to 0.
Factor.
Solve for 
Because 
choose the positive value to conclude that the diver hits the water at
seconds.
b. The velocity at time is given by the derivative 
Velocity function
So, the velocity at time 
is
feet per second.

miles per gallon. Assume that the average fuel cost is 
$3.48 per gallon. Find the annual cost of fuel

Who would benefit more from a one-mile-per-gallon increase

Product and Quotient Rules and Higher-Order Derivatives
Find the derivative of a function using the Product Rule.
Find the derivative of a function using the Quotient Rule.
Find the derivative of a trigonometric function.
Find a higher-order derivative of a function.
The Product Rule
In Section 2.2, you learned that the derivative of the sum of two functions is simply the
sum of their derivatives. The rules for the derivatives of the product and quotient of two
functions are not as simple.
Proof
Some mathematical proofs, such as the proof of the Sum Rule, are straight-
forward. Others involve clever steps that may appear unmotivated to a reader. This
proof involves such a step—subtracting and adding the same quantity—which is shown
in color.
Note that 
because is given to be differentiable and therefore
is continuous.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The Product Rule can be extended to cover products involving more than two
factors. For example, if 
and are differentiable functions of 
then

A graphing
utility can be used to compare
the graph of a function with 
the graph of its derivative.

Note the use of parentheses in Example 4. A liberal use of parentheses is 
recommended for all types of differentiation problems. For instance, with the Quotient
Rule, it is a good idea to enclose all factors and derivatives in parentheses, and to pay
special attention to the subtraction required in the numerator. 
When differentiation rules were introduced in the preceding section, the need for
rewriting before differentiating was emphasized. The next example illustrates this point
with the Quotient Rule.
Rewriting Before Differentiating
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of 
at 
Solution
Begin by rewriting the function.
Write original function.
Multiply numerator and denominator by 
Rewrite.
Next, apply the Quotient Rule.

To find the slope at 
evaluate 
Slope of graph at 
Then, using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, you can determine that the
equation of the tangent line at 
is 
See Figure 2.23.
Not every quotient needs to be differentiated by the Quotient Rule. For instance,
each quotient in the next example can be considered as the product of a constant times
a function of 
In such cases, it is more convenient to use the Constant Multiple Rule.

Higher-Order Derivatives
Just as you can obtain a velocity function by differentiating a position function, you 
can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a velocity function. Another way
of looking at this is that you can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a
position function twice.
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
The function 
is the second derivative of 
and is denoted by 
The second derivative is an example of a higher-order derivative. You can define
derivatives of any positive integer order. For instance, the third derivative is the deriv-
ative of the second derivative. Higher-order derivatives are denoted as shown below.
First derivative:
Second derivative:

Finding the Acceleration Due to Gravity
Because the moon has no atmosphere, a falling
object on the moon encounters no air resistance. 
In 1971, astronaut David Scott demonstrated that 
a feather and a hammer fall at the same rate on 
the moon. The position function for each of these
falling objects is 
where 
is the height in meters and is the 
time in seconds, as shown in the figure at the 
right. What is the ratio of Earth’s gravitational
force to the moon’s?
Solution
To find the acceleration, differentiate the position function twice.
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
So, the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 
meters per second per second.
Because the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 
meters per second per second,
the ratio of Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s is 
  6.0.

Differentiation
The moon’s mass is 
kilograms, and Earth’s mass is
kilograms.The moon’s
radius is 1737 kilometers, and
Earth’s radius is 6378 kilometers.
Because the gravitational force
on the surface of a planet is
directly proportional to its mass
and inversely proportional to the
square of its radius, the ratio of
the gravitational force on Earth 
to the gravitational force on the
moon is

The Chain Rule
Find the derivative of a composite function using the Chain Rule.

Simplify the derivative of a function using algebra.
Find the derivative of a trigonometric function using the Chain Rule.
The Chain Rule
This text has yet to discuss one of the most powerful differentiation rules—the Chain
Rule. This rule deals with composite functions and adds a surprising versatility to the
rules discussed in the two previous sections. For example, compare the functions shown
below. Those on the left can be differentiated without the Chain Rule, and those on the
right are best differentiated with the Chain Rule.
Without the Chain Rule
With the Chain Rule
Basically, the Chain Rule states that if changes 
times as fast as 
and changes
times as fast as 
then changes 
times as fast as 
The Derivative of a Composite Function
A set of gears is constructed, as shown in Figure 2.24, such that the second and third
gears are on the same axle. As the first axle revolves, it drives the second axle, which
in turn drives the third axle. Let 
and 
represent the numbers of revolutions per
minute of the first, second, and third axles, respectively. Find 
and 
and show that
Solution
Because the circumference of the second gear is three times that of the
first, the first axle must make three revolutions to turn the second axle once. Similarly,
the second axle must make two revolutions to turn the third axle once, and you can write
and
Combining these two results, you know that the first axle must make six revolutions to
turn the third axle once. So, you can write
.
In other words, the rate of change of 
with respect to 
is the product of the rate of
change of with respect to and the rate of change of with respect to x.

Example 1 illustrates a simple case of the Chain Rule. The general rule is stated in
the next theorem.

In the proofs of the
Product Rule and the Quotient Rule, the same quantity was added and subtracted to
obtain the desired form. This proof uses a similar technique—multiplying and dividing by
the same (nonzero) quantity. Note that because

and it follows that

When applying the Chain Rule, it is helpful to think of the composite function 
as having two parts—an inner part and an outer part.
Outer function
Inner function
The derivative of 
is the derivative of the outer function (at the inner function )
times the derivative of the inner function.

Implicit Differentiation
Distinguish between functions written in implicit form and explicit form.
Use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of a function.
Implicit and Explicit Functions
Up to this point in the text, most functions have been expressed in explicit form. For
example, in the equation 
the variable is explicitly written as a function
of 
Some functions, however, are only implied by an equation. For instance, the 
function 
is defined implicitly by the equation
Implicit form
To find 
for this equation, you can write 
explicitly as a function of 
and then
differentiate.
Implicit Form
Explicit Form
Derivative
This strategy works whenever you can solve for the function explicitly. You cannot,
however, use this procedure when you are unable to solve for as a function of 
For
instance, how would you find 
for the equation
For this equation, it is difficult to express as a function of explicitly. To find 
you can use implicit differentiation.
To understand how to find 
implicitly, you must realize that the differentiation
is taking place with respect to 
This means that when you differentiate terms involving
alone, you can differentiate as usual. However, when you differentiate terms involving
you must apply the Chain Rule, because you are assuming that is defined implicitly
as a differentiable function of

It is meaningless to solve for 
in an equation that has no solution points. (For
example,
has no solution points.) If, however, a segment of a graph can
be represented by a differentiable function, then 
will have meaning as the slope
at each point on the segment. Recall that a function is not differentiable at (a) points
with vertical tangents and (b) points at which the function is not continuous.

a.

The largest interval about the origin for which 
is a differentiable function of 
is
To see this, note that 
is positive for all in this interval and is
0 at the endpoints. When you restrict

The kappa curve
Figure 2.32
ISAAC BARROW (1630–1677)
The graph in Figure 2.32 is called
the kappa curve because it 
resembles the Greek letter kappa,
The general solution for the
tangent line to this curve was 
discovered by the English mathe-
matician Isaac Barrow. Newton
was Barrow’s student, and 
they corresponded frequently 
regarding their work in the 
early development of calculus.

Finding Related Rates
You have seen how the Chain Rule can be used to find 
implicitly. Another 
important use of the Chain Rule is to find the rates of change of two or more related
variables that are changing with respect to time.
For example, when water is drained out of a conical tank (see Figure 2.33), the 
volume 
the radius 
and the height 
of the water level are all functions of time 
Knowing that these variables are related by the equation

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING RELATED-RATE PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and quantities to be determined. Make a sketch
and label the quantities.
2. Write an equation involving the variables whose rates of change either are
given or are to be determined.
3. Using the Chain Rule, implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with
respect to time
4. After completing Step 3, substitute into the resulting equation all known
values for the variables and their rates of change. Then solve for the required
rate of change.
t.
Total area increases as the outer radius
increases.

REMARK
When using 
these guidelines, be sure you
perform Step 3 before Step 4.
Substituting the known 
values of the variables before
differentiating will produce an
inappropriate derivative.

An Inflating Balloon
Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon (see Figure 2.35) at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet
per minute. Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.
Solution
Let 
be the volume of the balloon, and let 
be its radius. Because the 
volume is increasing at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute, you know that at time the
rate of change of the volume is 
So, the problem can be stated as shown.
Given rate:

Find:
when
To find the rate of change of the radius, you must find an equation that relates the radius
to the volume 
Equation:

Solve for 
Finally, when 
the rate of change of the radius is
foot per minute.
In Example 3, note that the volume is increasing at a constant rate, but the radius is
increasing at a variable rate. Just because two rates are related does not mean that they
are proportional. In this particular case, the radius is growing more and more slowly as
increases. Do you see why?

Extrema on an Interval
Understand the definition of extrema of a function on an interval.
Understand the definition of relative extrema of a function on an open interval.
Find extrema on a closed interval.
Extrema of a Function
In calculus, much effort is devoted to determining the behavior of a function on an
interval 
Does have a maximum value on 
Does it have a minimum value? Where
is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? In this chapter, you will learn how
derivatives can be used to answer these questions. You will also see why these questions
are important in real-life applications.
A function need not have a minimum or a maximum on an interval. For instance,
in Figure 3.1(a) and (b), you can see that the function 
has both a
minimum and a maximum on the closed interval 
but does not have a maximum
on the open interval 
Moreover, in Figure 3.1(c), you can see that continuity (or
the lack of it) can affect the existence of an extremum on the interval. This suggests the
theorem below. (Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively plausible, a proof
of this theorem is not within the scope of this text.)

The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are the extreme 
values, or extrema (the singular form of extrema is extremum), of the function 
on the interval. The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are 
also called the absolute minimum and absolute maximum, or the global 
minimum and global maximum, on the interval. Extrema can occur at interior
points or endpoints of an interval (see Figure 3.1). Extrema that occur at the 
endpoints are called endpoint extrema.

Relative Extrema and Critical Numbers
In Figure 3.2, the graph of 
has a relative maximum at the point 
and a relative minimum at the point 
Informally, for a continuous function,
you can think of a relative maximum as occurring on a “hill” on the graph, and a 
relative minimum as occurring in a “valley” on the graph. Such a hill and valley can
occur in two ways. When the hill (or valley) is smooth and rounded, the graph has a 
horizontal tangent line at the high point (or low point). When the hill (or valley) is sharp
and peaked, the graph represents a function that is not differentiable at the high point
(or low point).
Example 1 examines the derivatives of functions at given relative extrema. (Much
more is said about finding the relative extrema of a function in Section 3.3.)

Definition of Relative Extrema
1. If there is an open interval containing on which 
is a maximum, then 
is called a relative maximum of 
or you can say that has a relative
maximum at 
2. If there is an open interval containing on which 
is a minimum, then 
is called a relative minimum of 
or you can say that has a relative
minimum at 
The plural of relative maximum is relative maxima, and the plural of relative 
minimum is relative minima. Relative maximum and relative minimum are 
sometimes called local maximum and local minimum, respectively.

Note in Example 1 that at each relative extremum, the derivative either is zero or
does not exist. The -values at these special points are called critical numbers. Figure

Case 1: If is not differentiable at

Case 2: If

Suppose

which implies that there exists an interval

[See Exercise 78(b), Section 1.2.]
Because this quotient is positive, the signs of the denominator and numerator must
agree. This produces the following inequalities for -values in the interval

Right of c:

So, the assumption that

only one possibility—namely,

PIERRE DE FERMAT (1601–1665)
For Fermat, who was trained as 
a lawyer, mathematics was more
of a hobby than a profession.
Nevertheless, Fermat made 
many contributions to analytic
geometry, number theory, calculus,
and probability. In letters to
friends, he wrote of many of the
fundamental ideas of calculus,
long before Newton or Leibniz.
For instance,Theorem 3.2 is
sometimes attributed to Fermat.

Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval
Theorem 3.2 states that the relative extrema of a function can occur only at the critical
numbers of the function. Knowing this, you can use the following guidelines to find
extrema on a closed interval.
The next three examples show how to apply these guidelines. Be sure you see that
finding the critical numbers of the function is only part of the procedure. Evaluating the
function at the critical numbers and the endpoints is the other part.
Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval
Find the extrema of
on the interval 
Solution
Begin by differentiating the function.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
To find the critical numbers of in the interval 
you must find all -values for
which

Critical numbers
Because

you can conclude that these are the only critical numbers
of 
By evaluating at these two critical numbers and at the endpoints of 
you
can determine that the maximum is 
and the minimum is 
as
shown in the table. The graph of is shown in Figure 3.5.
In Figure 3.5, note that the critical number 
does not yield a relative minimum
or a relative maximum. This tells you that the converse of Theorem 3.2 is not true. In
other words, the critical numbers of a function need not produce relative extrema.

Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval
Find the extrema of

Solution
Begin by differentiating the function.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
Simplify.
From this derivative, you can see that the function has two critical numbers in the 
interval 
The number 1 is a critical number because 
and the 
number 0 is a critical number because 
does not exist. By evaluating at these two
numbers and at the endpoints of the interval, you can conclude that the minimum is
and the maximum is 
as shown in the table. The graph of is
shown in Figure 3.6.

Rolle’s Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem

Understand and use the Mean Value Theorem.
Rolle’s Theorem
The Extreme Value Theorem (see Section 3.1) states that a continuous function on a
closed interval 
must have both a minimum and a maximum on the interval. Both
of these values, however, can occur at the endpoints. Rolle’s Theorem, named after the
French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719), gives conditions that guarantee the
existence of an extreme value in the interior of a closed interval.
Proof
Let 
Case 1: If 
for all in 
then is constant on the interval and, by Theorem
2.2,
for all in 
Case 2: Consider 
for some 
in 
By the Extreme Value Theorem, you
know that has a maximum at some in the interval. Moreover, because 
this
maximum does not occur at either endpoint. So,
has a maximum in the open
interval 
This implies that 
is a relative maximum and, by Theorem 3.2,
is a
critical number of 
Finally, because 
is differentiable at 
you can conclude that
Case 3: When 
for some in 
you can use an argument similar to that in
Case 2, but involving the minimum instead of the maximum.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
From Rolle’s Theorem, you can see that if a function is continuous on 
and
differentiable on 
and if 
then there must be at least one -value
between 
and 
at which the graph of has a horizontal tangent [see Figure 3.8(a)].
When the differentiability requirement is dropped from Rolle’s Theorem,
will still
have a critical number in 
but it may not yield a horizontal tangent. Such a case
is shown in Figure 3.8(b).

ROLLE’S THEOREM
French mathematician Michel
Rolle first published the theorem
that bears his name in 1691.
Before this time, however, Rolle
was one of the most vocal critics
of calculus, stating that it gave
erroneous results and was based
on unsound reasoning. Later in
life, Rolle came to see the 
usefulness of calculus.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A graphing utility can be used to indicate whether
the points on the graphs in Examples 1 and 2 are relative minima or relative maxima
of the functions. When using a graphing utility, however, you should keep in mind
that it can give misleading pictures of graphs. For example, use a graphing utility to
graph
With most viewing windows, it appears that the function has a maximum of 1 when
(see Figure 3.11). By evaluating the function at 
however, you can see
that

See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Although the Mean Value Theorem can be used directly in problem solving, it is
used more often to prove other theorems. In fact, some people consider this to be the
most important theorem in calculus—it is closely related to the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus discussed in Section 4.4. For now, you can get an idea of the versatility 
of the Mean Value Theorem by looking at the results stated in Exercises 77–85 in this
section.
The Mean Value Theorem has implications for both basic interpretations of the
derivative. Geometrically, the theorem guarantees the existence of a tangent line that 
is parallel to the secant line through the points
and
as shown in Figure 3.12. Example 3 illustrates this geometric interpretation of the Mean
Value Theorem. In terms of rates of change, the Mean Value Theorem implies that there
must be a point in the open interval 
at which the instantaneous rate of change is
equal to the average rate of change over the interval 
This is illustrated in Example 4.

Finding an Instantaneous Rate of Change
Two stationary patrol cars equipped with radar are 5 miles apart on a highway, as shown
in Figure 3.14. As a truck passes the first patrol car, its speed is clocked at 55 miles per
hour. Four minutes later, when the truck passes the second patrol car, its speed is
clocked at 50 miles per hour. Prove that the truck must have exceeded the speed limit
(of 55 miles per hour) at some time during the 4 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the time (in hours) when the truck passes the first patrol car.
The time when the truck passes the second patrol car is
By letting 
represent the distance (in miles) traveled by the truck, you have 
and 
So, the average velocity of the truck over the five-mile stretch of
highway is
miles per hour.
Assuming that the position function is differentiable, you can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to conclude that the truck must have been traveling at a rate of 75 miles per
hour sometime during the 4 minutes.

Increasing and Decreasing Functions and the First DerivativeTest
Determine intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.
Apply the First Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In this section, you will learn how derivatives can be used to classify relative extrema
as either relative minima or relative maxima. First, it is important to define increasing
and decreasing functions.
A function is increasing when, as 
moves to the right, its graph moves up, and 
is decreasing when its graph moves down. 
For example, the function in Figure 3.15 is 
decreasing on the interval 
is constant
on the interval 
and is increasing on the
interval 
As shown in Theorem 3.5
below, a positive derivative implies that the
function is increasing, a negative derivative
implies that the function is decreasing, and 
a zero derivative on an entire interval 
implies that the function is constant on 
that interval.
Proof
To prove the first case, assume that 
for all in the interval 
and
let 
be any two points in the interval. By the Mean Value Theorem, you know
that there exists a number such that 
and
Because 
and 
you know that

So,
is increasing on the interval. The second case has a similar proof
(see Exercise 97), and the third case is a consequence of Exercise 78 in Section 3.2.

Critical numbers
Because there are no points for which

Example 1 gives you one instance of how to find intervals on which a function is
increasing or decreasing. The guidelines below summarize the steps followed in that
example.
A function is strictly monotonic on an interval when it is either increasing on the
entire interval or decreasing on the entire interval. For instance, the function 
is strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is increasing on the entire
real number line, as shown in Figure 3.17(a). The function shown in Figure 3.17(b) is
not strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is constant on the 
interval 0, 1.

1. Locate the critical numbers of in

test intervals.
2. Determine the sign of 
at one test value in each of the intervals.
3. Use Theorem 3.5 to determine whether is increasing or decreasing on each
interval.

The First Derivative Test
After you have determined the intervals on
which a function is increasing or decreasing,
it is not difficult to locate the relative extrema 
of the function. For instance, in Figure 3.18
(from Example 1), the function
has a relative maximum at the point 
because is increasing immediately to the left 
of 
and decreasing immediately to the
right of 
Similarly,
has a relative 
minimum at the point 
because is
decreasing immediately to the left of 
and increasing immediately to the right of
The next theorem makes this more explicit.
Proof
Assume that 
changes from negative to positive at 
Then there exist and
in such that
for all in 
and
for all in 
By Theorem 3.5,
is decreasing on 
and increasing on 
So,
is a 
minimum of on the open interval 
and, consequently, a relative minimum of 
This proves the first case of the theorem. The second case can be proved in a similar
way (see Exercise 98).

Chapter 3
Applications of Differentiation
When a projectile is propelled
from ground level and air resist-
ance is neglected, the object 
will travel farthest with an initial
angle of 45°. When, however, 
the projectile is propelled from 
a point above ground level, 
the angle that yields a maximum
horizontal distance is not 45°
(see Example 5).

Concavity and the Second Derivative Test
Determine intervals on which a function is concave upward or concave downward.
Find any points of inflection of the graph of a function.
Apply the Second Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Concavity
You have already seen that locating the intervals in which a function 
increases or
decreases helps to describe its graph. In this section, you will see how locating the 
intervals in which 
increases or decreases can be used to determine where the graph
of is curving upward or curving downward.
The following graphical interpretation of concavity is useful. (See Appendix A for
a proof of these results.) See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
1. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave upward on
then the graph of lies above all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 3.23(a).]
2. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave downward
on 
then the graph of lies below all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 3.23(b).]
(a) The graph of lies above its tangent lines.
(b) The graph of lies below its tangent lines.
Figure 3.23
To find the open intervals on which the graph of a function is concave upward or
concave downward, you need to find the intervals on which 
is increasing or decreasing.
For instance, the graph of
is concave downward on the open interval 
because
is decreasing there. (See Figure 3.24.) Similarly, the graph of is concave upward on
the interval 
because 
is increasing on 0, .

The next theorem shows how to use the second derivative of a function 
to determine intervals on which the graph of is concave upward or concave downward.
A proof of this theorem follows directly from Theorem 3.5 and the definition of 
concavity.
To apply Theorem 3.7, locate the -values at which 
or 
does not exist.
Use these -values to determine test intervals. Finally, test the sign of 
in each of
the test intervals.
Determining Concavity
Determine the open intervals on which the graph of
is concave upward or downward.
Solution
Begin by observing that 
is continuous on the entire real number line.
Next, find the second derivative of 
Rewrite original function.
Differentiate.
First derivative
Differentiate.
Second derivative
Because 
when 
and 
is defined on the entire real number line, you
should test 
in the intervals 
and 
The results are shown in
the table and in Figure 3.25.
The function given in Example 1 is continuous on the entire real number line.
When there are -values at which the function is not continuous, these values should be
used, along with the points at which 
or 
does not exist, to form the test
intervals.

Differentiating twice produces the following.

There are no points at which

The graph in Figure 3.25 has two points at which the concavity changes. If the

Definition of Point of Inflection
Let be a function that is continuous on an open interval, and let be a point 
in the interval. If the graph of has a tangent line at this point

changes from upward to downward (or downward to upward) at the point.

REMARK
The definition of point of inflection requires that the tangent line exists
at the point of inflection. Some books do not require this. For instance, we do not 
consider the function
to have a point of inflection at the origin, even though the concavity of the graph
changes from concave downward to concave upward.

To locate possible points of inflection, you can determine the values of for which

extrema of 
Finding Points of Inflection
Determine the points of inflection and discuss the concavity of the graph of 
Solution
Differentiating twice produces the following.
Write original function.
Find first derivative.
Find second derivative.
Setting 
you can determine that the possible points of inflection occur at
and 
By testing the intervals determined by these -values, you can 
conclude that they both yield points of inflection. A summary of this testing is shown
in the table, and the graph of is shown in Figure 3.28.
The converse of Theorem 3.8 is not generally true. That is, it is possible for the 
second derivative to be 0 at a point that is not a point of inflection. For instance, the
graph of 
is shown in Figure 3.29. The second derivative is 0 when 
but
the point 
is not a point of inflection because the graph of is concave upward in
both intervals 
and 
but 
is not a point of inflection.

The Second Derivative Test
In addition to testing for concavity, the second derivative can be used to perform a 
simple test for relative maxima and minima. The test is based on the fact that if the
graph of a function is concave upward on an open interval containing 
and 
then 
must be a relative minimum of 
Similarly, if the graph of a function is 
concave downward on an open interval containing 
and 
then 
must be a
relative maximum of (see Figure 3.30).
Proof

So,

Limits at Infinity
Determine (finite) limits at infinity.
Determine the horizontal asymptotes, if any, of the graph of a function.
Determine infinite limits at infinity.
Limits at Infinity
This section discusses the “end behavior” of a function on an infinite interval. Consider
the graph of
as shown in Figure 3.32. Graphically, you can see that the values of 
appear to
approach 3 as increases without bound or decreases without bound. You can come to
the same conclusions numerically, as shown in the table.
The table suggests that the value of 
approaches 3 as 
increases without bound
Similarly,
approaches 3 as decreases without bound 
These
limits at infinity are denoted by
Limit at negative infinity
and
Limit at positive infinity
To say that a statement is true as 
increases without bound means that for some
(large) real number 
the statement is true for all
in the interval 
The next
definition uses this concept.
The definition of a limit at infinity is shown in Figure 3.33. In this figure, note that
for a given positive number 
there exists a positive number 
such that, for 
the graph of will lie between the horizontal lines

Horizontal Asymptotes
In Figure 3.33, the graph of approaches the line 
as increases without bound.
The line 
is called a horizontal asymptote of the graph of 
Note that from this definition, it follows that the graph of a function of can have
at most two horizontal asymptotes—one to the right and one to the left.
Limits at infinity have many of the same properties of limits discussed in 
Section 1.3. For example, if 
and 
both exist, then
and

Finding a Limit at Infinity
Find the limit:
Solution
Note that both the numerator and the denominator approach infinity as 
approaches infinity.
This results in 
an indeterminate form. To resolve this problem, you can divide both
the numerator and the denominator by 
After dividing, the limit may be evaluated 
as shown.
Divide numerator and denominator by 
Simplify.
Take limits of numerator and denominator.
Apply Theorem 3.10.
So, the line

A Comparison of Three Rational Functions

Find each limit.
a.

c.
Solution
In each case, attempting to evaluate the limit produces the indeterminate
form 
a. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
b. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
c. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
You can conclude that the limit does not exist because the numerator increases 
without bound while the denominator approaches 3.
Example 3 suggests the guidelines below for finding limits at infinity of rational
functions. Use these guidelines to check the results in Example 3.
The guidelines for finding limits at infinity of rational functions seem reasonable
when you consider that for large values of 
the highest-power term of the rational
function is the most “influential” in determining the limit. For instance,
is 0 because the denominator overpowers the numerator as 
increases or decreases
without bound, as shown in Figure 3.37.
The function shown in Figure 3.37 is a special case of a type of curve studied by
the Italian mathematician Maria Gaetana Agnesi. The general form of this function is 
Witch of Agnesi
and, through a mistranslation of the Italian word vertéré, the curve has come to be
known as the Witch of Agnesi. Agnesi’s work with this curve first appeared in a
comprehensive text on calculus that was published in 1748.

GUIDELINES FOR FINDING LIMITS AT 
OF RATIONAL 
FUNCTIONS
1. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then
the limit of the rational function is 0.
2. If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, then
the limit of the rational function is the ratio of the leading coefficients.
3. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator,
then the limit of the rational function does not exist.

MARIA GAETANA AGNESI
(1718–1799)
Agnesi was one of a handful 
of women to receive credit for 
significant contributions to 
mathematics before the twentieth
century. In her early twenties, she
wrote the first text that included
both differential and integral 
calculus. By age 30, she was an
honorary member of the faculty
at the University of Bologna.

In Figure 3.37, you can see that the function
approaches the same horizontal asymptote to the right and to the left. This is always true
of rational functions. Functions that are not rational, however, may approach different
horizontal asymptotes to the right and to the left. This is demonstrated in Example 4.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
If you use a graphing utility to estimate a limit,
be sure that you also confirm the estimate analytically—the pictures shown by a
graphing utility can be misleading. For instance, Figure 3.39 shows one view of the
graph of
From this view, one could be convinced that the graph has 
as a horizontal
asymptote. An analytical approach shows that the horizontal asymptote is actually

Infinite Limits at Infinity
Many functions do not approach a finite limit as increases (or decreases) without bound.
For instance, no polynomial function has a finite limit at infinity. The next definition is
used to describe the behavior of polynomial and other functions at infinity.

also increases without bound. So, you can write

One way to evaluate each of these limits is to use long division to rewrite
the improper rational function as the sum of a polynomial and a rational function.

A Summary of Curve Sketching
Analyze and sketch the graph of a function.
Analyzing the Graph of a Function
It would be difficult to overstate the importance of using graphs in mathematics.
Descartes’s introduction of analytic geometry contributed significantly to the rapid
advances in calculus that began during the mid-seventeenth century. In the words of
Lagrange, “As long as algebra and geometry traveled separate paths their advance was
slow and their applications limited. But when these two sciences joined company, they
drew from each other fresh vitality and thenceforth marched on at a rapid pace toward
perfection.”
So far, you have studied several concepts that are useful in analyzing the graph of
a function.
•
intercepts and 
intercepts
(Section P.1)
• Symmetry
(Section P.1)
• Domain and range
(Section P.3)
• Continuity
(Section 1.4)
• Vertical asymptotes
(Section 1.5)
• Differentiability
(Section 2.1)
• Relative extrema
(Section 3.1)
• Concavity
(Section 3.4)
• Points of inflection
(Section 3.4)
• Horizontal asymptotes
(Section 3.5)
• Infinite limits at infinity
(Section 3.5)
When you are sketching the graph of a function, either by hand or with a graphing
utility, remember that normally you cannot show the entire graph. The decision as to
which part of the graph you choose to show is often crucial. For instance, which of the
viewing windows in Figure 3.44 better represents the graph of
By seeing both views, it is clear that the second viewing window gives a more complete
representation of the graph. But would a third viewing window reveal other interesting
portions of the graph? To answer this, you need to use calculus to interpret the first and
second derivatives. Here are some guidelines for determining a good viewing window
for the graph of a function.

GUIDELINES FOR ANALYZING THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
1. Determine the domain and range of the function.
2. Determine the intercepts, asymptotes, and symmetry of the graph.
3. Locate the 
values for which 
and 
either are zero or do not exist.
Use the results to determine relative extrema and points of inflection.

For instance, Figure 3.46 shows a view of the graph of
From this view, it appears that the graph of is about the same as the graph of shown

Although the graph of the function in Example 2 has no horizontal asymptote, it
does have a slant asymptote. The graph of a rational function (having no common
factors and whose denominator is of degree 1 or greater) has a slant asymptote when
the degree of the numerator exceeds the degree of the denominator by exactly 1. To find
the slant asymptote, use long division to rewrite the rational function as the sum of a

3.51(a). Using a computer algebra system such as Maple [see Figure 3.51(b)] can help
you verify your analysis.
The fourth-degree polynomial function in Example 5 has one relative minimum
and no relative maxima. In general, a polynomial function of degree can have at most
relative extrema, and at most
points of inflection. Moreover, polynomial
functions of even degree must have at least one relative extremum.
Remember from the Leading Coefficient Test described in Section P.3 that the “end
behavior” of the graph of a polynomial function is determined by its leading coefficient
and its degree. For instance, because the polynomial in Example 5 has a positive 
leading coefficient, the graph rises to the right. Moreover, because the degree is even,
the graph also rises to the left.

Optimization Problems
Solve applied minimum and maximum problems.
Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems
One of the most common applications of calculus involves the determination of
minimum and maximum values. Consider how frequently you hear or read terms such as
greatest profit, least cost, least time, greatest voltage, optimum size, least size, greatest
strength, and greatest distance. Before outlining a general problem-solving strategy for
such problems, consider the next example.
Finding Maximum Volume
A manufacturer wants to design an open box having a square base and a surface area of
108 square inches, as shown in Figure 3.53. What dimensions will produce a box with
maximum volume?
Solution
Because the box has a square base, its volume is
Primary equation
This equation is called the primary equation because it gives a formula for the 
quantity to be optimized. The surface area of the box is
Secondary equation
Because 
is to be maximized, you want to write 
as a function of just one variable.
To do this, you can solve the equation 
for 
in terms of 
to obtain
Substituting into the primary equation produces

Substitute for 
Function of one variable
Before finding which 
value will yield a maximum value of 
you should determine
the feasible domain. That is, what values of 
make sense in this problem? You know
that 
You also know that 
must be nonnegative and that the area of the base
is at most 108. So, the feasible domain is

In Example 1, you should realize that there are infinitely many open boxes having 
108 square inches of surface area. To begin solving the problem, you might ask 
yourself which basic shape would seem to yield a maximum volume. Should the box
be tall, squat, or nearly cubical?
You might even try calculating a few volumes, as shown in Figure 3.54, to see if
you can get a better feeling for what the optimum dimensions should be. Remember
that you are not ready to begin solving a problem until you have clearly identified what
the problem is.

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING APPLIED MINIMUM AND 
MAXIMUM PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and all quantities to be determined. If possible,
make a sketch.
2. Write a primary equation for the quantity that is to be maximized or 
minimized. (A review of several useful formulas from geometry is presented
inside the back cover.)
3. Reduce the primary equation to one having a single independent variable.
This may involve the use of secondary equations relating the independent
variables of the primary equation.
4. Determine the feasible domain of the primary equation. That is, determine 
the values for which the stated problem makes sense.
5. Determine the desired maximum or minimum value by the calculus 
techniques discussed in Sections 3.1 through 3.4.
REMARK
For Step 5, recall that to determine the maximum or minimum value of
a continuous function on a closed interval, you should compare the values of at its
critical numbers with the values of at the endpoints of the interval.

amount of paper is used?
Solution

Newton, Sir Isaac (1643-1727), English mathematician and physicist, who brought the
scientific revolution of the 17th century to its climax and established the principal outlines
of the system of natural science that has since dominated Western thought. In mathematics,
he was the first person to develop the calculus. In optics, he established the heterogeneity
of light and the periodicity of certain phenomena. In mechanics, his three laws of motion
became  the  foundation  of  modern  dynamics,  and  from  them  he  derived  the  law  of
universal gravitation.
Newton was born on January 4, 1643, at W oolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire.
When he was three years old, his widowed mother remarried, leaving him to be reared by
her mother. Eventually, his mother, by then widowed a second time, was persuaded to
send him to grammar school in Grantham; then, in the summer of 1661, he was sent to
Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1665, and after an intermission of nearly two
years caused by the plague, Newton stayed on at Trinity, which elected him to a
fellowship in 1667; he took his master's degree in 1668. Meanwhile, he had largely
ignored the established curriculum of the university to pursue his own interests:
mathematics and natural philosophy. Proceeding entirely on his own, Newton investigated
the latest developments in 17th-century mathematics and the new natural philosophy that
treated  nature  as  a  complicated  machine.  Almost  immediately, he  made  fundamental
discoveries that laid the foundation of his career in science.
The Fluxional Method
Newton's first achievement came in mathematics. He generalized the earlier methods
that were being used to draw tangents to curves (similar to differentiation) and to calculate
areas under curves (similar to integration), recognized that the two procedures were inverse
operations, and—joining them in what he called the fluxional method—developed in the
autumn of 1666 what is now known as the calculus. The calculus was a new and powerful
instrument that carried modern mathematics above the level of Greek geometry.Although
Newton was its inventor, he did not introduce it into European mathematics. Always
morbidly fearful of publication and criticism, he kept his discovery to himself, although
enough was known of his abilities to effect his appointment in 1669 as Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1675 the German mathematician
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz arrived independently at virtually the same method, which he
called the differential calculus.  Leibniz proceeded to publish his method, and the world of
mathematics not only learned it from him but also accepted his name for it and his
notation. Newton himself did not publish any detailed exposition of his fluxional method
until 1704.
Optics
Optics was another of Newton's early interests. In trying to explain how phenomena of
colors arise, he arrived at the idea that sunlight is a heterogeneous mixture of different
rays—each of which provokes the sensation of a different color—and that reflections and
refractions cause colors to appear by separating the mixture into its components. He
devised an experimental demonstration of this theory, one of the great early exhibitions of
the power of experimental investigation in science. His measurement of the rings reflected
from  a  thin  film  of  air  confined  between  a  lens  and  a  sheet  of  glass  was  the  first
demonstration of periodicity in optical phenomena. In 1672 Newton sent a brief
exposition of his theory of colors to the Royal Society in London. Its appearance in the
Philosophical  Transactions led  to  a  number  of  criticisms  that  confirmed  his  fear  of
publication, and he subsequently withdrew as much as possible into the solitude of his
Cambridge study. He did not publish his full Opticks until 1704.

Finding Minimum Length
Two posts, one 12 feet high and the other 28 feet high, stand 30 feet apart. They are to
be stayed by two wires, attached to a single stake, running from ground level to the top
of each post. Where should the stake be placed to use the least amount of wire?
Solution
Let 
be the wire length to be
minimized. Using Figure 3.57, you can write
Primary equation
In this problem, rather than solving for in
terms of (or vice versa), you can solve for
both and in terms of a third variable 
as
shown in Figure 3.57. From the Pythagorean
Theorem, you obtain
which implies that
So, you can rewrite the primary equation as
Differentiating 
with respect to yields
By letting 
you obtain
Because 
is not in the domain and
and
you can conclude that the wire should be staked at 9 feet from the 12-foot pole.

In each of the first four examples, the extreme value occurred at a critical number.
Although this happens often, remember that an extreme value can also occur at an 
endpoint of an interval, as shown in Example 5.
An Endpoint Maximum
Four feet of wire is to be used to form a square and a circle. How much of the wire
should be used for the square and how much should be used for the circle to enclose the
maximum total area?
Solution
The total area (see Figure 3.59) is
Primary equation
Because the total length of wire is 4 feet, you obtain
So,
and by substituting into the primary equation you have
The feasible domain is 
restricted by the square’s perimeter. Because
the only critical number in 
is 
So, using
and
you can conclude that the maximum area occurs when 
That is, all the wire is
used for the circle.
Before doing the section exercises, review the primary equations developed in the
first five examples. As applications go, these five examples are fairly simple, and yet the
resulting primary equations are quite complicated.

Example 2

Example 4
Example 5
You must expect that real-life applications often involve equations that are at least as
complicated as these five. Remember that one of the main goals of this course is to learn
to use calculus to analyze equations that initially seem formidable.

Whenever the Connecticut River reaches a level of 105 feet above
sea level, two Northampton, Massachusetts, flood control station
operators begin a round-the-clock river watch. Every 2 hours, they
check the height of the river, using a scale marked off in tenths of
a foot, and record the data in a log book. In the spring of 1996, the
flood watch lasted from April 4, when the river reached 105 feet
and was rising at 0.2 foot per hour, until April 25, when the level 
subsided again to 105 feet. Between those dates, their log shows
that the river rose and fell several times, at one point coming close
to the 115-foot mark. If the river had reached 115 feet, the city
would have closed down Mount Tom Road (Route 5, south of
Northampton).
The graph below shows the rate of change of the level of the river
during one portion of the flood watch. Use the graph to answer
each question.
(a) On what date was the river rising most rapidly? How do you
know?
(b) On what date was the river falling most rapidly? How do you
know?
(c) There were two dates in a row on which the river rose, then fell,
then rose again during the course of the day. On which days did
this occur, and how do you know?
(d) At 1 minute past midnight, April 14, the river level was 
111.0 feet. Estimate its height 24 hours later and 48 hours later.
Explain how you made your estimates.
(e) The river crested at 114.4 feet. On what date do you think this
occurred?

Newton’s Method
Approximate a zero of a function using Newton’s Method.
Newton’s Method
In this section, you will study a technique for approximating the real zeros of a function.
The technique is called Newton’s Method, and it uses tangent lines to approximate the
graph of the function near its -intercepts.
To see how Newton’s Method works, consider a function that is continuous on the
interval 
and differentiable on the interval 
If 
and 
differ in sign,
then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem,
must have at least one zero in the interval
To estimate this zero, you choose
First estimate
as shown in Figure 3.60(a). Newton’s Method is based on the assumption that the graph
of and the tangent line at 
both cross the -axis at about the same point.
Because you can easily calculate the -intercept for this tangent line, you can use it as
a second (and, usually, better) estimate of the zero of The tangent line passes through
the point 
with a slope of 
In point-slope form, the equation of the 
tangent line is
Letting 
and solving for produces
So, from the initial estimate 
you obtain a new estimate
Second estimate [See Figure 3.60(b).]
You can improve on 
and calculate yet a third estimate
Third estimate
Repeated application of this process is called Newton’s Method.

NEWTON’S METHOD
Isaac Newton first described the
method for approximating the real
zeros of a function in his text
Method of Fluxions. Although the
book was written in 1671, it 
was not published until 1736.
Meanwhile, in 1690, Joseph
Raphson (1648–1715) published 
a paper describing a method for
approximating the real zeros of 
a function that was very similar 
to Newton’s. For this reason, the
method is often referred to as 
the Newton-Raphson method.

Using Newton’s Method
Calculate three iterations of Newton’s Method to approximate a zero of 
Use 
as the initial guess.
Solution
Because 
you have 
and the iterative formula is
The calculations for three iterations are shown in the table.
Of course, in this case you know that the two zeros of the function are 
To six 
decimal places,
So, after only three iterations of Newton’s Method,
you have obtained an approximation that is within 0.000002 of an actual root. The first
iteration of this process is shown in Figure 3.61.
Using Newton’s Method
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Use Newton’s Method to approximate the zeros of
Continue the iterations until two successive approximations differ by less than 0.0001.
Solution
Begin by sketching a graph of 
as shown in Figure 3.62. From the graph,
you can observe that the function has only one zero, which occurs near 
Next,
differentiate and form the iterative formula
The calculations are shown in the table.
Because two successive approximations differ by less than the required 0.0001, you
can estimate the zero of to be 1.23375.

It can be shown that a condition sufficient to produce convergence of Newton’s
Method to a zero of is that
Condition for convergence
on an open interval containing the zero. For instance, in Example 1, this test would yield
and
Example 1
On the interval 
this quantity is less than 1 and therefore the convergence of
Newton’s Method is guaranteed. On the other hand, in Example 3, you have 
and
Example 3
which is not less than 1 for any value of 
so you cannot conclude that Newton’s
Method will converge.
You have learned several techniques for finding the zeros of functions. The zeros
of some functions, such as
can be found by simple algebraic techniques, such as factoring. The zeros of other 
functions, such as
cannot be found by elementary algebraic methods. This particular function has only one
real zero, and by using more advanced algebraic techniques, you can determine the zero
to be
Because the exact solution is written in terms of square roots and cube roots, it is called
a solution by radicals.
The determination of radical solutions of a polynomial equation is one of the 
fundamental problems of algebra. The earliest such result is the Quadratic Formula,
which dates back at least to Babylonian times. The general formula for the zeros of a
cubic function was developed much later. In the sixteenth century, an Italian 
mathematician, Jerome Cardan, published a method for finding radical solutions to
cubic and quartic equations. Then, for 300 years, the problem of finding a general 
quintic formula remained open. Finally, in the nineteenth century, the problem was
answered independently by two young mathematicians. Niels Henrik Abel, a
Norwegian mathematician, and Evariste Galois, a French mathematician, proved that it
is not possible to solve a general fifth- (or higher-) degree polynomial equation by 
radicals. Of course, you can solve particular fifth-degree equations, such as
but Abel and Galois were able to show that no general radical solution exists.

which the graph of a function can be approximated by a straight line.
To begin, consider a function

Error Propagation
Physicists and engineers tend to make liberal use of the approximation of 
by 
One
way this occurs in practice is in the estimation of errors propagated by physical 
measuring devices. For example, if you let represent the measured value of a variable
and let 
represent the exact value, then 
is the error in measurement. Finally,
if the measured value 
is used to compute another value 
then the difference
between 
and 
is the propagated error.

Estimation of Error
The measured radius of a ball bearing is 0.7 inch,
as shown in the figure. The measurement is 
correct to within 0.01 inch. Estimate the 
propagated error in the volume 
of the ball 
bearing.
Solution
The formula for the volume of a
sphere is
where is the radius of the sphere. So, you can write
Measured radius
and
Possible error
To approximate the propagated error in the volume, differentiate 
to obtain
and write
Approximate 
by 
Substitute for and 
So, the volume has a propagated error of about 0.06 cubic inch.
Would you say that the propagated error in Example 3 is large or small? The
answer is best given in relative terms by comparing 
with 
The ratio
Ratio of 
to 
Simplify.
Substitute for 
and 
is called the relative error. The corresponding percent error is approximately 4.29%.

The notation in Example 4 is called the Leibniz notation for derivatives and
differentials, named after the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The
beauty of this notation is that it provides an easy way to remember several important
calculus formulas by making it seem as though the formulas were derived from algebraic
manipulations of differentials. For instance, in Leibniz notation, the Chain Rule
would appear to be true because the 
’s divide out. Even though this reasoning is
incorrect, the notation does help one remember the Chain Rule.

GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ
(1646–1716)
Both Leibniz and Newton are
credited with creating calculus.
It was Leibniz, however, who tried
to broaden calculus by developing
rules and formal notation. He
often spent days choosing an
appropriate notation for a 
new concept.

In fact, if you use a graphing utility to zoom in near the point of tangency 
, you
will see that the two graphs appear to coincide. Notice also that as you move farther
away from the point of tangency, the linear approximation becomes less accurate.

4.1
Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integration
245
Using Theorem 4.1, you can represent the entire family of antiderivatives of a 
function by adding a constant to a known antiderivative. For example, knowing that
you can represent the family of all antiderivatives of 
by
Family of all antiderivatives of
where 
is a constant. The constant 
is called the constant of integration. The 
family of functions represented by 
is the general antiderivative of 
and
is the general solution of the differential equation
Differential equation
A differential equation in and is an equation that involves 
and derivatives

For instance,
and
are examples of differential equations.
Solving a Differential Equation
Find the general solution of the differential equation 
Solution
To begin, you need to find a function whose derivative is 2. One such 
function is
is an antiderivative of 2.
Now, you can use Theorem 4.1 to conclude that the general solution of the differential
equation is
General solution
The graphs of several functions of the form 
are shown in Figure 4.1.
When solving a differential equation of the form
it is convenient to write it in the equivalent differential form
The operation of finding all solutions of this equation is called antidifferentiation (or
indefinite integration) and is denoted by an integral sign 
The general solution is
denoted by
The expression 
is read as the antiderivative of 
with respect to 
So, the
differential 
serves to identify 
as the variable of integration. The term indefinite
integral is a synonym for antiderivative.

Initial Conditions and Particular Solutions
You have already seen that the equation 
has many solutions (each differing
from the others by a constant). This means that the graphs of any two antiderivatives of
are vertical translations of each other. For example, Figure 4.2 shows the graphs of
several antiderivatives of the form
General solution
for various integer values of 
Each of these antiderivatives is a solution of the
differential equation
In many applications of integration, you are given enough information to determine
a particular solution. To do this, you need only know the value of 
for one
value of 
This information is called an initial condition. For example, in Figure 4.2,
only one curve passes through the point 
To find this curve, you can use the 
general solution

By using the initial condition in the general solution, you can determine that

Chapter 4
Integration
So far in this section, you have been using 
as the variable of integration. In
applications, it is often convenient to use a different variable. For instance, in the next
example, involving time, the variable of integration is 
Solving a Vertical Motion Problem
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second from an initial
height of 80 feet.
a. Find the position function giving the height as a function of the time 
b. When does the ball hit the ground?
Solution
a. Let 
represent the initial time. The two given initial conditions can be written
as follows.
Initial height is 80 feet.
Initial velocity is 64 feet per second.
Using 
feet per second per second as the acceleration due to gravity, you can
write
Using the initial velocity, you obtain 
which implies that
Next, by integrating 
you obtain
Using the initial height, you obtain
which implies that 
So, the position function is
See Figure 4.4.
b. Using the position function found in part (a), you can find the time at which the ball
hits the ground by solving the equation 
Because 
must be positive, you can conclude that the ball hits the ground 
5 seconds after it was thrown.
In Example 9, note that the position function has the form 
where 
is the initial velocity, and 
is the initial height, as presented in
Section 2.2.
Example 9 shows how to use calculus to analyze vertical motion problems in which
the acceleration is determined by a gravitational force. You can use a similar strategy to
analyze other linear motion problems (vertical or horizontal) in which the acceleration
(or deceleration) is the result of some other force, as you will see in Exercises 61–68.

Sigma Notation
In the preceding section, you studied antidifferentiation. In this section, you will look
further into a problem introduced in Section 1.1—that of finding the area of a region in
the plane. At first glance, these two ideas may seem unrelated, but you will discover in
Section 4.4 that they are closely related by an extremely important theorem called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
This section begins by introducing a concise notation for sums. This notation is
called sigma notation because it uses the uppercase Greek letter sigma, written as

Area
In Euclidean geometry, the simplest type of plane region is a rectangle. Although 
people often say that the formula for the area of a rectangle is
it is actually more proper to say that this is the definition
of the area of a rectangle.
From this definition, you can develop formulas for 
the areas of many other plane regions. For example, to 
determine the area of a triangle, you can form a rectangle 
whose area is twice that of the triangle, as shown in 
Figure 4.5. Once you know how to find the area of a 
triangle, you can determine the area of any polygon by 
subdividing the polygon into triangular regions, as 
shown in Figure 4.6.
Parallelogram
Hexagon
Polygon
Figure 4.6
Finding the areas of regions other than polygons is more difficult. The ancient
Greeks were able to determine formulas for the areas of some general regions
(principally those bounded by conics) by the exhaustion method. The clearest
description of this method was given by Archimedes. Essentially, the method is a
limiting process in which the area is squeezed between two polygons—one inscribed in
the region and one circumscribed about the region.
For instance, in Figure 4.7, the area of a circular region is approximated by an 
-sided inscribed polygon and an -sided circumscribed polygon. For each value of 
the area of the inscribed polygon is less than the area of the circle, and the area of the
circumscribed polygon is greater than the area of the circle. Moreover, as 
increases,
the areas of both polygons become better and better approximations of the area of 
the circle.
The exhaustion method for finding the area of a circular region

A process that is similar to that used by Archimedes to determine the area of a
plane region is used in the remaining examples in this section.

ARCHIMEDES (287–212 B.C.)
Archimedes used the method of
exhaustion to derive formulas for
the areas of ellipses, parabolic 
segments, and sectors of a spiral.
He is considered to have been 
the greatest applied mathematician
of antiquity.

The Area of a Plane Region
Recall from Section 1.1 that the origins of calculus are connected to two classic
problems: the tangent line problem and the area problem. Example 3 begins the
investigation of the area problem.
Approximating the Area of a Plane Region
Use the five rectangles in Figure 4.8(a) and (b) to find two approximations of the area
of the region lying between the graph of
and the -axis between 
and 
Solution
a. The right endpoints of the five intervals are
Right endpoints
where 
The width of each rectangle is 
and the height of each 
rectangle can be obtained by evaluating at the right endpoint of each interval.
Evaluate f at the right endpoints of these intervals.
The sum of the areas of the five rectangles is
Height Width
Because each of the five rectangles lies inside the parabolic region, you can 
conclude that the area of the parabolic region is greater than 6.48.
b. The left endpoints of the five intervals are
Left endpoints
where 
The width of each rectangle is 
and the height of each 
rectangle can be obtained by evaluating at the left endpoint of each interval. So, the
sum is
Height
Width
Because the parabolic region lies within the union of the five rectangular regions,
you can conclude that the area of the parabolic region is less than 8.08.
By combining the results in parts (a) and (b), you can conclude that
By increasing the number of rectangles used in Example 3, you can obtain closer
and closer approximations of the area of the region. For instance, using 25 rectangles
of width 
each, you can conclude that
7.1712 < Area of region < 7.4912.

Upper and Lower Sums
The procedure used in Example 3 can be generalized as follows. Consider a plane
region bounded above by the graph of a nonnegative, continuous function
as shown in Figure 4.9. The region is bounded below by the -axis, and the left and right
boundaries of the region are the vertical lines 
and 
To approximate the area of the region, begin by subdividing the interval 
into
subintervals, each of width
as shown in Figure 4.10. The endpoints of the intervals are
Because 
is continuous, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a 
minimum and a maximum value of 
in each subinterval.
Minimum value of 
in th subinterval
Maximum value of 
in th subinterval
Next, define an inscribed rectangle lying inside the th subregion and a circumscribed
rectangle extending outside the th subregion. The height of the th inscribed rectangle
is 
and the height of the th circumscribed rectangle is 
For each
the area
of the inscribed rectangle is less than or equal to the area of the circumscribed 
rectangle.
The sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles is called a lower sum, and the sum of
the areas of the circumscribed rectangles is called an upper sum.
Area of inscribed rectangles
Area of circumscribed rectangles
From Figure 4.11, you can see that the lower sum 
is less than or equal to the upper
sum 
Moreover, the actual area of the region lies between these two sums.

Example 4 illustrates some important things about lower and upper sums. First,
notice that for any value of 
the lower sum is less than (or equal to) the upper sum.
Second, the difference between these two sums lessens as increases. In fact, when you
take the limits as 
both the lower sum and the upper sum approach 
Lower sum limit
and
Upper sum limit
The next theorem shows that the equivalence of the limits (as 
) of the upper
and lower sums is not mere coincidence. It is true for all functions that are continuous
and nonnegative on the closed interval 
The proof of this theorem is best left to a
course in advanced calculus.
In Theorem 4.3, the same limit is attained for both the minimum value 
and
the maximum value 
So, it follows from the Squeeze Theorem (Theorem 1.8) that
the choice of in the th subinterval does not affect the limit. This means that you are
free to choose an arbitrary -value in the th subinterval, as shown in the definition of
the area of a region in the plane.

as shown in Figure 4.16.
Solution
When is a continuous, nonnegative function of

The area of the region is 
In Examples 5, 6, and 7,
is chosen to be a value that is convenient for calculating
the limit. Because each limit gives the exact area for any
there is no need to find 
values that give good approximations when is small. For an approximation, however,
you should try to find a value of 
that gives a good approximation of the area of the 
th subregion. In general, a good value to choose is the midpoint of the interval,
and apply the Midpoint Rule.

the graph of

Riemann Sums
In the definition of area given in Section 4.2, the partitions have subintervals of equal
width. This was done only for computational convenience. The next example shows that
it is not necessary to have subintervals of equal width.
A Partition with Subintervals of Unequal Widths
Consider the region bounded by the graph of
and the 
axis for 
as shown in Figure 4.18. Evaluate the limit
where 
is the right endpoint of the partition given by 
and 
is the width
of the th interval.
Solution
The width of the th interval is
So, the limit is
From Example 7 in Section 4.2, you know that the region shown in Figure 4.19 has
an area of 
Because the square bounded by 
and 
has an area of 1,
you can conclude that the area of the region shown in Figure 4.18 has an area of 
. This agrees with the limit found in Example 1, even though that example used a
partition having subintervals of unequal widths. The reason this particular partition gave
the proper area is that as 
increases, the width of the largest subinterval approaches
zero. This is a key feature of the development of definite integrals.

In Section 4.2, the limit of a sum was used to define the area of a region in the
plane. Finding area by this means is only one of many applications involving the limit
of a sum. A similar approach can be used to determine quantities as diverse as arc
lengths, average values, centroids, volumes, work, and surface areas. The next 
definition is named after Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann. Although the definite
integral had been defined and used long before Riemann’s time, he generalized the 
concept to cover a broader category of functions.
In the definition of a Riemann sum below, note that the function 
has no 
restrictions other than being defined on the interval 
(In Section 4.2, the function 
was assumed to be continuous and nonnegative because you were finding the area 
under a curve.)
The width of the largest subinterval of a partition 
is the norm of the partition and
is denoted by 
If every subinterval is of equal width, then the partition is regular
and the norm is denoted by
Regular partition
For a general partition, the norm is related to the number of subintervals of 
in the
following way.
General partition
So, the number of subintervals in a partition approaches infinity as the norm of the 
partition approaches 0. That is,
implies that 
The converse of this statement is not true. For example, let 
be the partition of
the interval 
given by
As shown in Figure 4.20, for any positive value of 
the norm of the partition 
is 
So, letting 
approach infinity does not force 
to approach 0. In a regular partition,
however, the statements
and
are equivalent.

German mathematician Riemann
did his most famous work in the

Definite Integrals
To define the definite integral, consider the limit
To say that this limit exists means there exists a real number such that for each 
there exists a 
such that for every partition with 
it follows that

It is not a coincidence that the notation for definite integrals is similar to that used
for indefinite integrals. You will see why in the next section when the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus is introduced. For now, it is important to see that definite integrals
and indefinite integrals are different concepts. A definite integral is a number, whereas
an indefinite integral is a family of functions.
Though Riemann sums were defined for functions with very few restrictions, a 
sufficient condition for a function to be integrable on 
is that it is continuous on
A proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text.

Evaluating a Definite Integral as a Limit
Evaluate the definite integral 
Solution
The function 
is integrable on the interval 
because it is
continuous on 
Moreover, the definition of integrability implies that any 
partition whose norm approaches 0 can be used to determine the limit. For 
computational convenience, define 
by subdividing 
into 
subintervals of
equal width
Choosing 
as the right endpoint of each subinterval produces
So, the definite integral is
Because the definite integral in Example 2 is negative, it does not represent the area
of the region shown in Figure 4.21. Definite integrals can be positive, negative, or zero.
For a definite integral to be interpreted as an area (as defined in Section 4.2), the 
function must be continuous and nonnegative on 
as stated in the next theorem.
The proof of this theorem is straightforward—you simply use the definition of area
given in Section 4.2, because it is a Riemann sum.

As an example of Theorem 4.5, consider the region bounded by the graph of
and the axis, as shown in Figure 4.23. Because is continuous and nonnegative on the
closed interval 
the area of the region is
A straightforward technique for evaluating a definite integral such as this will be
discussed in Section 4.4. For now, however, you can evaluate a definite integral in two
ways—you can use the limit definition 
you can check to see whether the definite
integral represents the area of a common geometric region, such as a rectangle, triangle,
or semicircle.
Areas of Common Geometric Figures
Sketch the region corresponding to each definite integral. Then evaluate each integral
using a geometric formula.

Solution
A sketch of each region is shown in Figure 4.24.
a. This region is a rectangle of height 4 and width 2.
(Area of rectangle)
b. This region is a trapezoid with an altitude of 3 and parallel bases of lengths 2 and
5. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is 
(Area of trapezoid)
c. This region is a semicircle of radius 2. The formula for the area of a semicircle is
(Area of semicircle)

The variable of integration in a definite integral is sometimes called a dummy 
variable because it can be replaced by any other variable without changing the value of
the integral. For instance, the definite integrals
and
have the same value.

Properties of Definite Integrals
The definition of the definite integral of on the interval 
specifies that 
Now, however, it is convenient to extend the definition to cover cases in which 
or 
Geometrically, the next two definitions seem reasonable. For instance, it
makes sense to define the area of a region of zero width and finite height to be 0.
Evaluating Definite Integrals
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Evaluate each definite integral.
a.
b.
Solution
a. Because the sine function is defined at 
and the upper and lower limits of 
integration are equal, you can write
b. The integral 
is the same as that given in Example 3(b) except that the
upper and lower limits are interchanged. Because the integral in Example 3(b) has a
value of 
you can write
In Figure 4.25, the larger region can be divided at 
into two subregions whose
intersection is a line segment. Because the line segment has zero area, it follows that the
area of the larger region is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller regions.

Because the definite integral is defined as the limit of a sum, it inherits the
properties of summation given at the top of page 255.
Evaluation of a Definite Integral

are continuous on the closed interval 
and 
for
then the following properties are true. First, the area of the region bounded
by the graph of and the 
axis (between 
and ) must be nonnegative. Second, this
area must be less than or equal to the area of the region bounded by the graph of and
the 
axis (between 
and ), as shown in Figure 4.26. These two properties are 
generalized in Theorem 4.8.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Understand and use the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
Find the average value of a function over a closed interval.

Understand and use the Net Change Theorem.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
You have now been introduced to the two major branches of calculus: differential
calculus (introduced with the tangent line problem) and integral calculus (introduced
with the area problem). So far, these two problems might seem unrelated—but there is
a very close connection. The connection was discovered independently by Isaac Newton
and Gottfried Leibniz and is stated in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Informally, the theorem states that differentiation and (definite) integration are
inverse operations, in the same sense that division and multiplication are inverse
operations. To see how Newton and Leibniz might have anticipated this relationship,
consider the approximations shown in Figure 4.27. The slope of the tangent line was
defined using the quotient
(the slope of the secant line). Similarly, the area of a
region under a curve was defined using the product
(the area of a rectangle). So,
at least in the primitive approximation stage, the operations of differentiation and definite
integration appear to have an inverse relationship in the same sense that division and
multiplication are inverse operations. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that
the limit processes (used to define the derivative and definite integral) preserve this
inverse relationship.

(b) Definite integration
Differentiation and definite integration have an “inverse” relationship.

ANTIDIFFERENTIATION AND DEFINITE INTEGRATION
Throughout this chapter, you have been using the integral sign to denote an antiderivative
(a family of functions) and a definite integral (a number).
Antidifferentiation:
Definite integration:
The use of the same symbol for both operations makes it appear that they are related.
In the early work with calculus, however, it was not known that the two operations were
related.The symbol 
was first applied to the definite integral by Leibniz and was derived
from the letter 
(Leibniz calculated area as an infinite sum, thus, the letter S.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
In Section 4.2, you saw that the area of a region under a curve is greater than the area
of an inscribed rectangle and less than the area of a circumscribed rectangle. The Mean
Value Theorem for Integrals states that somewhere “between” the inscribed and circum-
scribed rectangles, there is a rectangle whose area is precisely equal to the area of the
region under the curve, as shown in Figure 4.30.
Proof
Case 1: If is constant on the interval 
then the theorem is clearly valid because
can be any point in 
Case 2: If is not constant on 
then, by the Extreme Value Theorem, you can
choose 
and 
to be the minimum and maximum values of on 
Because
for all in 
you can apply Theorem 4.8 to write the following.
See Figure 4.31.

Average Value of a Function
The value of 
given in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is called the average
value of on the interval 
To see why the average value of is defined in this way, partition 
into 
subintervals of equal width
If 
is any point in the th subinterval, then the arithmetic average (or mean) of the 
function values at the ’s is 
Average of 
By multiplying and dividing by 
you can write the average as
Finally, taking the limit as 
produces the average value of on the interval 
as given in the definition above. In Figure 4.32, notice that the area of the region under
the graph of is equal to the area of the rectangle whose height is the average value.
This development of the average value of a function on an interval is only one
of many practical uses of definite integrals to represent summation processes. In
Chapter 7, you will study other applications, such as volume, arc length, centers of
mass, and work.

The Speed of Sound
At different altitudes in Earth’s atmosphere, sound travels at different speeds. The speed
of sound 
(in meters per second) can be modeled by
where 
is the altitude in kilometers (see Figure 4.34). What is the average speed of
sound over the interval 
Speed of sound depends on altitude.

Solution
Begin by integrating 
over the interval 
To do this, you can break
the integral into five parts.
By adding the values of the five integrals, you have

Integration
The first person to fly at a speed
greater than the speed of sound
was Charles Yeager. On October
14, 1947, Yeager was clocked at
295.9 meters per second at an
altitude of 12.2 kilometers. If
Yeager had been flying at an 
altitude below 11.275 kilometers,
this speed would not have 
“broken the sound barrier.” The
photo shows an F/A-18F Super
Hornet, a supersonic twin-engine
strike fighter. A “green Hornet”
using a 50/50 mixture of biofuel
made from camelina oil became
the first U.S. naval tactical 
aircraft to exceed 1 mach.

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Earlier you saw that the definite integral of on the interval 
was defined using the
constant as the upper limit of integration and as the variable of integration. However,
a slightly different situation may arise in which the variable is used in the upper limit
of integration. To avoid the confusion of using in two different ways,
is temporarily
used as the variable of integration. (Remember that the definite integral is 
a 
function of its variable of integration.)
The Definite Integral as a Number
The Definite Integral as a Function of
The Definite Integral as a Function
Evaluate the function
at 
Solution
You could evaluate five different definite integrals, one for each of the
given upper limits. However, it is much simpler to fix 
(as a constant) temporarily
to obtain
Now, using 
you can obtain the results shown in Figure 4.35.
You can think of the function 
as accumulating the area under the curve
from 
to 
For 
the area is 0 and 
For 
gives the accumulated area under the cosine curve on the entire interval
This interpretation of an integral as an accumulation function is used often
in applications of integration.

Net Change Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 4.9) states that if is continuous on
the closed interval 
and 
is an antiderivative of on 
then
But because 
this statement can be rewritten as
where the quantity 
represents the net change of F on the interval 
Using the Net Change Theorem
A chemical flows into a storage tank at a rate 
of 
liters per minute, where is the 
time in minutes and  
Find the 
amount of the chemical that flows into the 
tank during the first 20 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the amount of the 
chemical in the tank at time 
Then 
represents the rate at which the chemical 
flows into the tank at time 
During the 
first 20 minutes, the amount that flows 
into the tank is
So, the amount that flows into the tank during 
the first 20 minutes is 4200 liters.
Another way to illustrate the Net Change Theorem is to examine the velocity of a
particle moving along a straight line, where 
is the position at time 
Then its 
velocity is 
and 
This definite integral represents the net change in position, or displacement, of the 
particle.

Pattern Recognition
In this section, you will study techniques for integrating composite functions. The
discussion is split into two parts—pattern recognition and change of variables. Both
techniques involve a 
-substitution. With pattern recognition, you perform the
substitution mentally, and with change of variables, you write the substitution steps.
The role of substitution in integration is comparable to the role of the Chain Rule
in differentiation. Recall that for the differentiable functions
and
the Chain Rule states that
From the definition of an antiderivative, it follows that
These results are summarized in the next theorem.
Examples 1 and 2 show how to apply Theorem 4.13 directly, by recognizing the
presence of 
and 
Note that the composite function in the integrand has an
outside function
and an inside function 
Moreover, the derivative 
is present as
a factor of the integrand.

The integrands in Examples 1 and 2 fit the 
pattern exactly—you only
had to recognize the pattern. You can extend this technique considerably with the
Constant Multiple Rule
Many integrands contain the essential part (the variable part) of 
but are missing a
constant multiple. In such cases, you can multiply and divide by the necessary constant
multiple, as shown in Example 3.
Multiplying and Dividing by a Constant
Find the indefinite integral.

This is similar to the integral given in Example 1, except that the integrand
is missing a factor of 2. Recognizing that 
is the derivative of

Constant Multiple Rule
Integrate.
Simplify.
In practice, most people would not write as many steps as are shown in Example 3.
For instance, you could evaluate the integral by simply writing
Be sure you see that the Constant Multiple Rule applies only to constants. You 
cannot multiply and divide by a variable and then move the variable outside the integral
sign. For instance,
After all, if it were legitimate to move variable quantities outside the integral sign, you
could move the entire integrand out and simplify the whole process. But the result
would be incorrect.

Change of Variables
With a formal change of variables, you completely rewrite the integral in terms of 
and 
(or any other convenient variable). Although this procedure can involve more
written steps than the pattern recognition illustrated in Examples 1 to 3, it is useful for
complicated integrands. The change of variables technique uses the Leibniz notation for
the differential. That is, if 
then 
and the integral in Theorem
4.13 takes the form

Because 
integration is usually more 
difficult than differentiation,
you should always check your
answer to an integration 
problem by differentiating. 
For instance, in Example 4,
you should differentiate
to verify that
you obtain the original integrand.

the correct antiderivative.
The steps used for integration by substitution are summarized in the following
guidelines.
So far, you have seen two techniques for applying substitution, and you will 
see more techniques in the remainder of this section. Each technique differs slightly
from the others. You should remember, however, that the goal is the same with each 
technique—you are trying to find an antiderivative of the integrand.

When making a
change of variables, be sure that
your answer is written using 
the same variables as in the
original integrand. For instance,
in Example 6, you should not
leave your answer as

The General Power Rule for Integration
One of the most common 
substitutions involves quantities in the integrand that are
raised to a power. Because of the importance of this type of substitution, it is given a
special name—the General Power Rule for Integration. A proof of this rule follows
directly from the (simple) Power Rule for Integration, together with Theorem 4.13.

Some integrals whose integrands involve quantities raised to powers cannot be
found by the General Power Rule. Consider the two integrals
and
The substitution
works in the first integral, but not in the second. In the second, the substitution fails
because the integrand lacks the factor needed for 
Fortunately, for this particular
integral, you can expand the integrand as
and use the (simple) Power Rule to integrate each term.

Change of Variables for Definite Integrals
When using 
substitution with a definite integral, it is often convenient to determine
the limits of integration for the variable rather than to convert the antiderivative back
to the variable 
and evaluate at the original limits. This change of variables is stated
explicitly in the next theorem. The proof follows from Theorem 4.13 combined with
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Now, substitute to obtain
Geometrically, you can interpret the equation
to mean that the two different regions shown in Figures 4.38 and 4.39 have the same
area.
When evaluating definite integrals by substitution, it is possible for the upper limit
of integration of the 
variable form to be smaller than the lower limit. When this 
happens, don’t rearrange the limits. Simply evaluate as usual. For example, after
substituting 
in the integral
you obtain 
when 
and

So, the
correct 
variable form of this integral is
Expanding the integrand, you can evaluate this integral as shown.

Integration of Even and Odd Functions
Even with a change of variables, integration can be difficult. Occasionally, you can 
simplify the evaluation of a definite integral over an interval that is symmetric about the
axis or about the origin by recognizing the integrand to be an even or odd function
(see Figure 4.40).
Proof
Here is the proof of the first property. (The proof of the second property is left
to you see Exercise 99 ) Because 
is even, you know that 
Using
Theorem 4.13 with the substitution 
produces
Finally, using Theorem 4.6, you obtain
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Integration of an Odd Function
Evaluate the definite integral.
Solution
Letting 
produces
So, is an odd function, and because is symmetric about the origin over 
you can apply Theorem 4.16 to conclude that
From Figure 4.41, you can see that the two regions on either side of the axis have the
same area. However, because one lies below the axis and one lies above it, integration
produces a cancellation effect. (More will be said about areas below the -axis in
Section 7.1.)

Approximate a definite integral using the Trapezoidal Rule.
Approximate a definite integral using Simpson’s Rule.
Analyze the approximate errors in the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.
The Trapezoidal Rule
Some elementary functions simply do not have antiderivatives that are elementary 
functions. For example, there is no elementary function that has any of the following
functions as its derivative.
If you need to evaluate a definite integral involving a function whose antiderivative 
cannot be found, then while the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is still true, it 
cannot be easily applied. In this case, it is easier to resort to an approximation 
technique. Two such techniques are described in this section.
One way to approximate a definite integral is to use 
trapezoids, as shown in
Figure 4.42. In the development of this method, assume that 
is continuous and 
positive on the interval 
So, the definite integral
represents the area of the region bounded by the graph of and the 
axis, from 
to 
First, partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width
such that
Then form a trapezoid for each subinterval (see Figure 4.43). The area of the th
trapezoid is
Area of th trapezoid 
This implies that the sum of the areas of the trapezoids is
Letting 
you can take the limit as 
to obtain
The result is summarized in the next theorem.

Most graphing utilities and computer algebra systems have
built-in programs that can be used to approximate the value of a definite integral. Try
using such a program to approximate the integral in Example 1. How close is 
your approximation? When you use such a program, you need to be aware of its 
limitations. Often, you are given no indication of the degree of accuracy of the
approximation. Other times, you may be given an approximation that is completely
wrong. For instance, try using a built-in numerical integration program to evaluate

It is interesting to compare the Trapezoidal Rule with the Midpoint Rule given in
Section 4.2. For the Trapezoidal Rule, you average the function values at the endpoints
of the subintervals, but for the Midpoint Rule, you take the function values of the 
subinterval midpoints.
Midpoint Rule
Trapezoidal Rule
There are two important points that should be made concerning the Trapezoidal
Rule (or the Midpoint Rule). First, the approximation tends to become more accurate
as increases. For instance, in Example 1, when 
the Trapezoidal Rule yields an
approximation of 1.994. Second, although you could have used the Fundamental
Theorem to evaluate the integral in Example 1, this theorem cannot be used to evaluate
an integral as simple as 
because 
has no elementary antiderivative. Yet,
the Trapezoidal Rule can be applied to estimate this integral.
Simpson’s Rule
One way to view the trapezoidal approximation of a definite integral is to say that on
each subinterval, you approximate by a first-degree polynomial. In Simpson’s Rule,
named after the English mathematician Thomas Simpson (1710–1761), you take this
procedure one step further and approximate by second-degree polynomials.
Before presenting Simpson’s Rule, consider the next theorem for evaluating 
integrals of polynomials of degree 2 (or less).

To develop Simpson’s Rule for approximating a definite integral, you again
partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width 
This
time, however,
is required to be even, and the subintervals are grouped in pairs such
that
On each (double) subinterval 
, you can approximate by a polynomial 
of
degree less than or equal to 2. (See Exercise 47.) For example, on the subinterval
choose the polynomial of least degree passing through the points 
and 
as shown in Figure 4.45. Now, using as an approximation of on
this subinterval, you have, by Theorem 4.18,
Repeating this procedure on the entire interval 
produces the next theorem.
In Example 1, the Trapezoidal Rule was used to estimate 
In the next
example, Simpson’s Rule is applied to the same integral.

Error Analysis
When you use an approximation technique, it is important to know how accurate you
can expect the approximation to be. The next theorem, which is listed without proof,
gives the formulas for estimating the errors involved in the use of Simpson’s Rule and
the Trapezoidal Rule. In general, when using an approximation, you can think of the
error 
as the difference between 
and the approximation.
Theorem 4.20 states that the errors generated by the Trapezoidal Rule and
Simpson’s Rule have upper bounds dependent on the extreme values of 
and 
in the interval 
Furthermore, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by 
increasing
provided that 
and 
are continuous and therefore bounded in 
The Approximate Error in the Trapezoidal Rule
Determine a value of such that the Trapezoidal Rule will approximate the value of
with an error that is less than or equal to 0.01.
Solution
Begin by letting 
and finding the second derivative of 
and
The maximum value of 
on the interval 
So, by Theorem
4.20, you can write
To obtain an error 
that is less than 0.01, you must choose 
such that
So, you can choose 
(because 
must be greater than or equal to 2.89) and apply
the Trapezoidal Rule, as shown in Figure 4.46, to obtain
So, by adding and subtracting the error from this estimate, you know that

Graphing the Natural Logarithmic Function
Using only the definition of 
the natural logarithmic function, sketch a graph of the function. Explain your 
reasoning.
JOHN NAPIER (1550–1617)
Logarithms were invented by 
the Scottish mathematician John
Napier. Napier coined the term
logarithm, from the two Greek
words logos (or ratio) and 
arithmos (or number), to describe
the theory that he spent 20 years
developing and that first appeared
in the book Mirifici Logarithmorum
canonis descriptio (A Description
of the Marvelous Rule of
Logarithms). Although he did not
introduce the natural logarithmic
function, it is sometimes called the
Napierian logarithm.

To sketch the graph of 
you can think of the natural logarithmic function
as an antiderivative given by the differential equation
Figure 5.2 is a computer-generated graph, called a slope field (or direction field),
showing small line segments of slope 
The graph of 
is the solution that
passes through the point 
(You will study slope fields in Section 6.1.)
The next theorem lists some basic properties of the natural logarithmic function.
Proof
The domain of 
is 
by definition. Moreover, the function is
continuous because it is differentiable. It is increasing because its derivative
First derivative
is positive for 
as shown in Figure 5.3. It is concave downward because

is negative for 
The proof that 
is one-to-one is given in Appendix A. The 
following limits imply that its range is the entire real number line.
and
Verification of these two limits is given in Appendix A.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Using the definition of the natural logarithmic function, you can prove several
important properties involving operations with natural logarithms. If you are already
familiar with logarithms, you will recognize that these properties are characteristic of
all logarithms.

Proof
The first property has already been discussed. The proof of the second 
property follows from the fact that two antiderivatives of the same function differ at
most by a constant. From the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the
definition of the natural logarithmic function, you know that
So, consider the two derivatives
and 
Because 
and 
are both antiderivatives of 
they must differ at
most by a constant.
By letting 
you can see that 
The third property can be proved similarly by
comparing the derivatives of 
and 
Finally, using the second and third 
properties, you can prove the fourth property.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.

When using the properties of logarithms to rewrite logarithmic functions, you must
check to see whether the domain of the rewritten function is the same as the domain of
the original. For instance, the domain of

and the domain of 
is all positive real numbers. (See Figure 5.4.)

The Number 
It is likely that you have studied logarithms in an 
algebra course. There, without the benefit of calculus,
logarithms would have been defined in terms of a 
base number. For example, common logarithms 
have a base of 10 and therefore 
(You 
will learn more about this in Section 5.5.)
The base for the natural logarithm is defined
using the fact that the natural logarithmic function 
is continuous, is one-to-one, and has a range of
So, there must be a unique real number 
such that 
as shown in Figure 5.5. This 
number is denoted by the letter 
It can be shown 
that is irrational and has the following decimal 
approximation.
Once you know that 
you can use logarithmic properties to evaluate the
natural logarithms of several other numbers. For example, by using the property 
you can evaluate 
for various values of 
as shown in the table and in Figure 5.6.
The logarithms shown in the table above are convenient because the 
values are
integer powers of 
Most logarithmic expressions are, however, best evaluated with a
calculator.

The Derivative of the Natural Logarithmic Function
The derivative of the natural logarithmic function is given in Theorem 5.3. The first part
of the theorem follows from the definition of the natural logarithmic function as an 
antiderivative. The second part of the theorem is simply the Chain Rule version of the
first part.

Chain Rule
Napier used logarithmic properties to simplify calculations involving products,
quotients, and powers. Of course, given the availability of calculators, there is now 
little need for this particular application of logarithms. However, there is great value in
using logarithmic properties to simplify differentiation involving products, quotients,
and powers.

Integrating Rational

Early in Chapter 4, you
learned rules that allowed
you to integrate any
polynomial function. The
Log Rule presented in this
section goes a long way
toward enabling you to 
integrate rational functions.
For instance, each of the 
following functions can be
integrated with the Log Rule.

Integrals to which the Log Rule can be applied often appear in disguised form. For
instance, when a rational function has a numerator of degree greater than or equal to
that of the denominator, division may reveal a form to which you can apply the Log
Rule. This is shown in Example 5.

As you study the methods shown in Examples 5 and 6, be aware that both methods
involve rewriting a disguised integrand so that it fits one or more of the basic 
integration formulas. Throughout the remaining sections of Chapter 5 and in Chapter 8,
much time will be devoted to integration techniques. To master these techniques, you
must recognize the “form-fitting” nature of integration. In this sense, integration is not
nearly as straightforward as differentiation. Differentiation takes the form
“Here is the question; what is the answer?”
Integration is more like
“Here is the answer; what is the question?”
Here are some guidelines you can use for integration.

Solution
The solution can be written as an indefinite integral.
Because the integrand is a quotient whose denominator is raised to the first power, you
should try the Log Rule. There are three basic choices for

GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATION
1. Learn a basic list of integration formulas. (Including those given in this
section, you now have 12 formulas: the Power Rule, the Log Rule, and 
10 trigonometric rules. By the end of Section 5.7, this list will have expanded 
to 20 basic rules.)
2. Find an integration formula that resembles all or part of the integrand, and,
by trial and error, find a choice of that will make the integrand conform 
to the formula.
3. When you cannot find a -substitution that works, try altering the integrand.
You might try a trigonometric identity, multiplication and division by the
same quantity, addition and subtraction of the same quantity, or long division. 
Be creative.
4. If you have access to computer software that will find antiderivatives
symbolically, use it.

Existence of an Inverse Function
Not every function has an inverse function, and Theorem 5.6 suggests a graphical test
for those that do—the Horizontal Line Test for an inverse function. This test states that
a function has an inverse function if and only if every horizontal line intersects the
graph of at most once (see Figure 5.13). The next theorem formally states why the
Horizontal Line Test is valid. (Recall from Section 3.3 that a function is strictly
monotonic when it is either increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire
domain.)
Proof
The proof of the first part of the theorem is left as an exercise (See Exercise 97).
To prove the second part of the theorem, recall from Section P.3 that is one-to-one
when for 
and 
in its domain
Now, choose 
and 
in the domain of If 
then, because is strictly monotonic,
it follows that either 
or 
In either case,
So, is
one-to-one on the interval.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The Existence of an Inverse Function
a. From the graph of 
shown in Figure 5.14(a), it appears that is
increasing over its entire domain. To verify this, note that the derivative,
is positive for all real values of 
So, is strictly monotonic, and it
must have an inverse function.
b. From the graph of 
shown in Figure 5.14(b), you can see that 
the function does not pass the Horizontal Line Test. In other words, it is not 
one-to-one. For instance,
has the same value when 
0, and 1.
Not one-to-one
So, by Theorem 5.7, f does not have an inverse function.
Often, it is easier to prove that a function has an inverse function than to find the
inverse function. For instance, it would be difficult algebraically to find the inverse
function of the function in Example 2(a).

Finding an Inverse Function
Find the inverse function of 
Solution
From the graph of in Figure 5.15, it appears that is increasing over its
entire domain,
To verify this, note that

function. To find an equation for the inverse function, let

You can verify this result as shown.
Theorem 5.7 is useful in the next type of problem. You are given a function that is
not one-to-one on its domain. By restricting the domain to an interval on which the
function is strictly monotonic, you can conclude that the new function is one-to-one on
the restricted domain.
Testing Whether a Function Is One-to-One
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Show that the sine function
is not one-to-one on the entire real number line. Then show that 
is the
largest interval, centered at the origin, on which is strictly monotonic.
Solution
It is clear that is not one-to-one, because many different values yield the
same 
value. For instance,
Moreover,
is increasing on the open interval 
because its derivative
is positive there. Finally, because the left and right endpoints correspond to relative
extrema of the sine function, you can conclude that 
is increasing on the closed 
interval 
and that on any larger interval the function is not strictly 
monotonic (see Figure 5.16).

Differentiation and Integration
To differentiate exponential and logarithmic functions to other bases, you have three
options: (1) use the definitions of 
and 
and differentiate using the rules for the
natural exponential and logarithmic functions, (2) use logarithmic differentiation, or 
(3) use the differentiation rules for bases other than given in the next theorem.
Proof
By definition,
So, you can prove the first rule by letting
and differentiating with base to obtain
To prove the third rule, you can write
The second and fourth rules are simply the Chain Rule versions of the first and third rules.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.

Applications of Exponential Functions
An amount of 
dollars is deposited in an account at an annual
interest rate (in decimal form). What is the balance in the
account at the end of 1 year? The answer depends on the 
number of times the interest is compounded according to the 
formula
For instance, the result for a deposit of $1000 at 8% interest 
compounded times a year is shown in the table at the right. 
As increases, the balance 
approaches a limit. To 
develop this limit, use the next theorem. To test the 
reasonableness of this theorem, try evaluating
for several values of 
as shown in the table at the left. 
Given Theorem 5.15, take another look at the formula for the balance 
in an
account in which the interest is compounded 
times per year. By taking the limit as 
approaches infinity, you obtain
Take limit as 
Rewrite.
Let 
Then 
as 
Apply Theorem 5.15.
This limit produces the balance after 1 year of continuous compounding. So, for a
deposit of $1000 at 8% interest compounded continuously, the balance at the end of
1 year would be

Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Differentiation
Develop properties of the six inverse trigonometric functions.
Differentiate an inverse trigonometric function.
Review the basic differentiation rules for elementary functions.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
This section begins with a rather surprising statement:None of the six basic trigonometric
functions has an inverse function. This statement is true because all six trigonometric
functions are periodic and therefore are not one-to-one. In this section, you will examine
these six functions to see whether their domains can be redefined in such a way that
they will have inverse functions on the restricted domains.
In Example 4 of Section 5.3, you saw that the sine function is increasing (and 
therefore is one-to-one) on the interval
as shown in Figure 5.25. On this interval, you can define the inverse of the restricted
sine function as
if and only if
where 
and 
Under suitable restrictions, each of the six trigonometric functions is one-to-one
and so has an inverse function, as shown in the next definition. (Note that the term “iff”
is used to represent the phrase “if and only if.”)

The Inverse Secant Function
In the definitions of the inverse trigonometric
functions, the inverse secant function is defined by restricting the domain of 
the secant function to the intervals 
Most other texts and
reference books agree with this, but some disagree. What other domains might
make sense? Explain your reasoning graphically. Most calculators do not have
a key for the inverse secant function. How can you use a calculator to evaluate
the inverse secant function?

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In Section 5.1, you saw that the derivative of the transcendental function 
is
the algebraic function 
You will now see that the derivatives of
the inverse trigonometric functions also are algebraic (even though the inverse 
trigonometric functions are themselves transcendental).
The next theorem lists the derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions.
Note that the derivatives of arccos 
arccot 
and arccsc 
are the negatives of the
derivatives of arcsin 
arctan 
and arcsec 
respectively.

One consequence of this

the painting is 4 feet. The camera lens is 1 foot
below the lower edge of the painting, as shown 
in the figure at the right. How far should the 
camera be from the painting to maximize the
angle subtended by the camera lens?
Solution
In the figure, let 
be the angle to 
be maximized.

Review of Basic Differentiation Rules
In the 1600s, Europe was ushered into the scientific age by such great thinkers as
Descartes, Galileo, Huygens, Newton, and Kepler. These men believed that nature is
governed by basic laws—laws that can, for the most part, be written in terms of
mathematical equations. One of the most influential publications of this period—
Dialogue on the Great World Systems, by Galileo Galilei—has become a classic
description of modern scientific thought.
As mathematics has developed during the past few hundred years, a small number
of elementary functions have proven sufficient for modeling most* phenomena in
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, economics, and a variety of other fields. An
elementary function is a function from the following list or one that can be formed as
the sum, product, quotient, or composition of functions in the list.
Algebraic Functions
Transcendental Functions
Polynomial functions
Logarithmic functions
Rational functions
Exponential functions
Functions involving radicals
Trigonometric functions
Inverse trigonometric functions
With the differentiation rules introduced so far in the text, you can differentiate any
elementary function. For convenience, these differentiation rules are summarized below.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Differentiation
371
GALILEO GALILEI (1564–1642)
Galileo’s approach to science
departed from the accepted
Aristotelian view that nature had
describable qualities, such as 
“fluidity” and “potentiality.” He
chose to describe the physical
world in terms of measurable
quantities, such as time, distance,
force, and mass.

more of this biography.
* Some important functions used in engineering and science (such as Bessel functions and
gamma functions) are not elementary functions.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Integration
Integrate functions whose antiderivatives involve inverse trigonometric functions.
Use the method of completing the square to integrate a function.
Review the basic integration rules involving elementary functions.
Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions fall into three pairs. In each
pair, the derivative of one function is the negative of the other. For example,
and
When listing the antiderivative that corresponds to each of the inverse trigonometric
functions, you need to use only one member from each pair. It is conventional to use
as the antiderivative of 
rather than 
The next theorem
gives one antiderivative formula for each of the three pairs. The proofs of these
integration rules are left to you (see Exercises 75–77).

This integral does not appear to fit any of the basic integration formulas.
By splitting the integrand into two parts, however, you can see that the first part can be
found with the Power Rule and the second part yields an inverse sine function.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A symbolic integration utility can be useful for
integrating functions such as the one in Example 2. In some cases, however, the 
utility may fail to find an antiderivative for two reasons. First, some elementary 
functions do not have antiderivatives that are elementary functions. Second, every
utility has limitations—you might have entered a function that the utility was not 
programmed to handle. You should also remember that antiderivatives involving
trigonometric functions or logarithmic functions can be written in many different
forms. For instance, one utility found the integral in Example 2 to be
Try showing that this antiderivative is equivalent to the one found in Example 2.

Completing the Square
Completing the square helps when quadratic functions are involved in the integrand.
For example, the quadratic 
can be written as the difference of two squares
by adding and subtracting

Review of Basic Integration Rules
You have now completed the introduction of the basic integration rules. To be efficient
at applying these rules, you should have practiced enough so that each rule is committed
to memory.
You can learn a lot about the nature of integration by comparing this list with the
summary of differentiation rules given in the preceding section. For differentiation, you
now have rules that allow you to differentiate any elementary function. For integration,
this is far from true.
The integration rules listed above are primarily those that were happened on 
during the development of differentiation rules. So far, you have not learned any rules
or techniques for finding the antiderivative of a general product or quotient, the natural
logarithmic function, or the inverse trigonometric functions. More important, you 
cannot apply any of the rules in this list unless you can create the proper 
corresponding to the 
in the formula. The point is that you need to work more on 
integration techniques, which you will do in Chapter 8. The next two examples should
give you a better feeling for the integration problems that you can and cannot solve with
the techniques and rules you now know.

Hyperbolic Functions
In this section, you will look briefly at a special class of exponential functions called
hyperbolic functions. The name hyperbolic function arose from comparison of the area
of a semicircular region, as shown in Figure 5.29, with the area of a region under a
hyperbola, as shown in Figure 5.30. 
Circle:
Hyperbola:

The integral for the semicircular region involves an inverse trigonometric (circular)
function:
The integral for the hyperbolic region involves an inverse hyperbolic function:
This is only one of many ways in which the hyperbolic functions are similar to the
trigonometric functions.

Because the hyperbolic functions are written in terms of

you can easily
derive rules for their derivatives. The next theorem lists these derivatives with the 
corresponding integration rules.
Proof
Here is a proof of two of the differentiation rules. (You are asked to prove some
of the other differentiation rules in Exercises 103–105.)

Finding Relative Extrema
Find the relative extrema of
Solution
Using the result of Example 1(d), set the first derivative of equal to 0.
So, the critical numbers are 
and 
Using the Second Derivative Test, you
can verify that the point 
yields a relative maximum and the point 
yields a relative minimum, as shown in Figure 5.32. Try using a graphing utility to 
confirm this result. If your graphing utility does not have hyperbolic functions, you can
use exponential functions, as shown.
When a uniform flexible cable, such as a telephone wire, is suspended from two
points, it takes the shape of a catenary, as discussed in Example 3.
Hanging Power Cables
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Power cables are suspended between two towers, forming the catenary shown in 
Figure 5.33. The equation for this catenary is
The distance between the two towers is 
Find the slope of the catenary at the point
where the cable meets the right-hand tower.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
Unlike trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are not periodic. In fact, by
looking back at Figure 5.31, you can see that four of the six hyperbolic functions are
actually one-to-one (the hyperbolic sine, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent). So, you can
apply Theorem 5.7 to conclude that these four functions have inverse functions. The
other two (the hyperbolic cosine and secant) are one-to-one when their domains are
restricted to the positive real numbers, and for this restricted domain they also
have inverse functions. Because the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of
exponential functions, it is not surprising to find that the inverse hyperbolic functions
can be written in terms of logarithmic functions, as shown in Theorem 5.19.
Proof
The proof of this theorem is a straightforward application of the properties of
the exponential and logarithmic functions. For example, for
and
you can show that

The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions are shown in Figure 5.35.
The inverse hyperbolic secant can be used to define a curve called a tractrix or 
pursuit curve, as discussed in Example 5.
A Tractrix
A person is holding a rope that is tied to a boat, as shown in Figure 5.36. As the 
person walks along the dock, the boat travels along a tractrix, given by the equation
where 
is the length of the rope. For 
feet, find the distance the person must
walk to bring the boat to a position 5 feet from the dock.
Solution
In Figure 5.36, notice that the distance the person has walked is 
When 
this distance is
So, the person must walk about 41.27 feet to bring the boat to a position 5 feet from the
dock.

inverse trigonometric functions, are listed in Theorem 5.20 with the corresponding inte-

is a differential equation. In Section 6.2, you will see that problems involving radioactive
decay, population growth, and Newton’s Law of Cooling can be formulated in terms of
differential equations.
A function 
is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation 
is satisfied when 
and its derivatives are replaced by 
and its derivatives. For 
example, differentiation and substitution would show that 
is a solution of the
differential equation 
It can be shown that every solution of this differential
equation is of the form
General solution of 
where 
is any real number. This solution is called the general solution. Some 
differential equations have singular solutions that cannot be written as special cases of
the general solution. Such solutions, however, are not considered in this text. The order
of a differential equation is determined by the highest-order derivative in the equation.
For instance,
is a first-order differential equation. First-order linear differential
equations are discussed in Section 6.4.
In Section 4.1, Example 9, you saw that the second-order differential equation
has the general solution
General solution of 
which contains two arbitrary constants. It can be shown that a differential equation of
order has a general solution with arbitrary constants.

Geometrically, the general solution of a first-order differential equation represents
a family of curves known as solution curves, one for each value assigned to the 
arbitrary constant. For instance, you can verify that every function of the form
General solution of 
is a solution of the differential equation
Figure 6.1 shows four of the solution curves corresponding to different values of 
As discussed in Section 4.1, particular solutions of a differential equation are
obtained from initial conditions that give the values of the dependent variable or one
of its derivatives for particular values of the independent variable. The term “initial 
condition” stems from the fact that, often in problems involving time, the value of the
dependent variable or one of its derivatives is known at the initial time 
For
instance, the second-order differential equation
having the general solution
General solution of 
might have the following initial conditions.
Initial conditions
In this case, the initial conditions yield the particular solution
Particular solution
Finding a Particular Solution
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
For the differential equation
verify that 
is a solution. Then find the particular solution determined by the 
initial condition 
when

and 
in the original differential
equation.

Slope Fields
Solving a differential equation analytically can be difficult or even impossible.
However, there is a graphical approach you can use to learn a lot about the solution of
a differential equation. Consider a differential equation of the form
Differential equation
where 
is some expression in and 
At each point 
in the 
-plane where
is defined, the differential equation determines the slope 
of the solution
at that point. If you draw short line segments with slope 
at selected points 
in the domain of 
then these line segments form a slope field, or a direction field, for
the differential equation 
Each line segment has the same slope as the 
solution curve through that point. A slope field shows the general shape of all 
the solutions and can be helpful in getting a visual perspective of the directions of the
solutions of a differential equation.
Sketching a Slope Field
Sketch a slope field for the differential equation 
for the points 
and 
Solution
The slope of the solution curve at any point 
is
Slope at 
So, the slope at each point can be found as shown.

Draw short line segments at the three points with their respective slopes, as shown in
Figure 6.2.

this condition is 
So, the graph matches equation (i).

satisfies this condition is 
So, the graph matches equation (iii).

A solution curve of a differential equation 
is simply a curve in the
-plane whose tangent line at each point 
has slope equal to 
This is
illustrated in Example 5.
Sketching a Solution Using a Slope Field
Sketch a slope field for the differential equation
Use the slope field to sketch the solution that passes through the point 
Solution
Make a table showing the slopes at several points. The table shown is a
small sample. The slopes at many other points should be calculated to get a representative
slope field.
Next, draw line segments at the points with their respective slopes, as shown in
Figure 6.3.

Particular solution for 
Figure 6.3

Figure 6.4
After the slope field is drawn, start at the initial point 
and move to the right in the
direction of the line segment. Continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves 
parallel to the nearby line segments. Do the same to the left of 
The resulting 
solution is shown in Figure 6.4.
In Example 5, note that the slope field shows that 
increases to infinity as 
increases.

Drawing a slope field by
hand is tedious. In practice, slope fields are 
usually drawn using a graphing utility. If you
have access to a graphing utility that can graph
slope fields, try graphing the slope field for the
differential equation in Example 5. One example
of a slope field drawn by a graphing utility is
shown at the right.

Euler’s Method
Euler’s Method is a numerical approach to approximating the particular solution of the
differential equation
that passes through the point 
From the given information, you know that the
graph of the solution passes through the point 
and has a slope of 
at this
point. This gives you a “starting point” for approximating the solution.
From this starting point, you can proceed in the direction indicated by the slope.
Using a small step 
move along the tangent line until you arrive at the point 
where
and
as shown in Figure 6.5. Then, using 
as a new starting point, you can repeat the
process to obtain a second point 
The values of

are shown below.
When using this method, note that you can obtain better approximations of the exact
solution by choosing smaller and smaller step sizes.

Differential Equations: Growth and Decay
Use separation of variables to solve a simple differential equation.
Use exponential functions to model growth and decay in applied problems.
Differential Equations
In Section 6.1, you learned to analyze the solutions visually of differential equations
using slope fields and to approximate solutions numerically using Euler’s Method.
Analytically, you have learned to solve only two types of differential equations—those
of the forms 
and 
In this section, you will learn how to solve a more
general type of differential equation. The strategy is to rewrite the equation so that each
variable occurs on only one side of the equation. This strategy is called separation of
variables. (You will study this strategy in detail in Section 6.3.)
Solving a Differential Equation
Original equation
Multiply both sides by 
Integrate with respect to 
Apply Power Rule.
Rewrite, letting 
So, the general solution is 
When you integrate both sides of the equation in Example 1, you don’t need to add
a constant of integration to both sides. When you do, you still obtain the same result.
Some people prefer to use Leibniz notation and differentials when applying 
separation of variables. The solution to Example 1 is shown below using this notation.

Radioactive decay is measured in terms of half-life—the number of years required
for half of the atoms in a sample of radioactive material to decay. The rate of decay is
proportional to the amount present. The half-lives of some common radioactive 
isotopes are listed below.

Radioactive Decay
Ten grams of the plutonium isotope 
were released in a nuclear accident. How long
will it take for the 10 grams to decay to 1 gram?
Solution
Let represent the mass (in grams) of the plutonium. Because the rate of
decay is proportional to 
you know that
where is the time in years. To find the values of the constants 
and 
apply the 
initial conditions. Using the fact that

you can write

Next, using the fact that the half-life of

years, you have

Most graphing utilities have curve-fitting capabilities that can
be used to find models that represent data. Use the exponential regression feature of
a graphing utility and the information in Example 2 to find a model for the data. How
does your model compare with the given model?
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
disaster occurred after an 
earthquake and tsunami. 
Several of the reactors at the
plant experienced full meltdowns.

This model is
much easier to derive, but for
some applications it is not as
convenient to use.

Population Growth
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
An experimental population of fruit flies increases according to the law of exponential
growth. There were 100 flies after the second day of the experiment and 300 flies after
the fourth day. Approximately how many flies were in the original population?
Solution
Let 
be the number of flies at time 
where is measured in days.
Note that 
is continuous, whereas the number of flies is discrete. Because 
when 
and 
when 
you can write
and
From the first equation, you know that
Substituting this value into the second equation produces the following.
So, the exponential growth model is
To solve for 
reapply the condition 
when 
and obtain
So, the original population (when 
) consisted of approximately 
flies,
as shown in Figure 6.8.
Declining Sales
Four months after it stops advertising, a manufacturing company notices that its sales
have dropped from 100,000 units per month to 80,000 units per month. The sales 
follow an exponential pattern of decline. What will the sales be after another 2 months?
Solution
Use the exponential decay model 
where is measured in months.
From the initial condition 
you know that 
Moreover, because
when 
you have
So, after 2 more months 
you can expect the monthly sales rate to be

In Examples 2 through 5, you did not actually have to solve the differential
equation 
(This was done once in the proof of Theorem 6.1.) The next example
demonstrates a problem whose solution involves the separation of variables technique.
The example concerns Newton’s Law of Cooling, which states that the rate of change
in the temperature of an object is proportional to the difference between the object’s
temperature and the temperature of the surrounding medium.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
Let represent the temperature 
of an object in a room whose temperature is kept
at a constant 
The object cools from 
to 
in 10 minutes. How much longer
will it take for the temperature of the object to decrease to 
Solution
From Newton’s Law of Cooling, you know that the rate of change in is
proportional to the difference between and 60. This can be written as

terms with 
and a solution can be obtained by integration. Such 
equations are said to be separable, and the solution procedure is called separation of
variables. Below are some examples of differential equations that are separable.

A common problem in electrostatics,
thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics involves
finding a family of curves, each of which is
orthogonal to all members of a given family of
curves. For example, Figure 6.13 shows a family
of circles
Family of circles
each of which intersects the lines in the family
Family of lines
at right angles. Two such families of curves are
said to be mutually orthogonal, and each curve 
in one of the families is called an orthogonal 
trajectory of the other family. In electrostatics,
lines of force are orthogonal to the equipotential 
curves. In thermodynamics, the flow of heat across a plane surface is orthogonal to 
the isothermal curves. In hydrodynamics, the flow (stream) lines are orthogonal 
trajectories of the velocity potential curves.
Finding Orthogonal Trajectories
Describe the orthogonal trajectories for the family of curves given by
for 
Sketch several members of each family.
Solution
First, solve the given equation for 
and write 
Then, by differen-
tiating implicitly with respect to 
you obtain the differential equation
Differential equation
Slope of given family
Because 
represents the slope of the given family of curves at 
it follows that
the orthogonal family has the negative reciprocal slope 
So,
Slope of orthogonal family
Now you can find the orthogonal family by separating variables and integrating.
The centers are at the origin, and the transverse axes are vertical for

the orthogonal trajectories are hyperbolas. Several trajectories are shown

Logistic Differential Equation
In Section 6.2, the exponential growth model was derived from the fact that the rate of
change of a variable is proportional to the value of 
You observed that the differential
equation 
has the general solution 
Exponential growth is unlimited,
but when describing a population, there often exists some upper limit 
past which
growth cannot occur. This upper limit 
is called the carrying capacity, which is the
maximum population 
that can be sustained or supported as time increases. A model
that is often used to describe this type of growth is the logistic differential equation
Logistic differential equation
where and 
are positive constants. A population that satisfies this equation does not
grow without bound, but approaches the carrying capacity 
as increases.
From the equation, you can see that if is between 0 and the carrying capacity 
then 
and the population increases. If is greater than 
then 
and
the population decreases. The graph of the function 
is called the logistic curve, as
shown in Figure 6.15.

It is instructive to see why the integrating factor helps solve a linear differential equation
of the form 
When both sides of the equation are multiplied by the
integrating factor 
the left-hand side becomes the derivative of a product.

A Falling Object with Air Resistance
An object of mass 
is dropped from a hovering helicopter. The air resistance is 
proportional to the velocity of the object. Find the velocity of the object as a function
of time 
Solution
The velocity satisfies the equation
gravitational constant,
constant of proportionality
Letting 
you can separate variables to obtain
Because the object was dropped,
when 
so 
and it follows that
A simple electric circuit consists of an electric current (in amperes), a resistance
(in ohms), an inductance 
(in henrys), and a constant electromotive force 
(in
volts), as shown in Figure 6.18. According to Kirchhoff’s Second Law, if the switch 
is closed when 
then the applied electromotive force (voltage) is equal to the sum
of the voltage drops in the rest of the circuit. This, in turn, means that the current 
satisfies the differential equation
An Electric Circuit Problem
Find the current 
as a function of time 
(in seconds), given that 
satisfies the
differential equation 
where

One type of problem that can be described in terms of a differential equation
involves chemical mixtures, as illustrated in the next example.
A Mixture Problem
A tank contains 50 gallons of a solution composed of 90% water and 10% alcohol. A
second solution containing 50% water and 50% alcohol is added to the tank at the rate
of 4 gallons per minute. As the second solution is being added, the tank is being drained
at a rate of 5 gallons per minute, as shown in Figure 6.19. The solution in the tank is
stirred constantly. How much alcohol is in the tank after 10 minutes?
Solution
Let 
be the number of gallons of alcohol in the tank at any time 
You
know that 
when 
Because the number of gallons of solution in the tank at
any time is 
and the tank loses 5 gallons of solution per minute, it must lose
gallons of alcohol per minute. Furthermore, because the tank is gaining 2 gallons of
alcohol per minute, the rate of change of alcohol in the tank is
To solve this linear differential equation, let
and obtain
Because 
you can drop the absolute value signs and conclude that
So, the general solution is
Because 
when 
you have

A person’s weight depends on both the number of calories
consumed and the energy used. Moreover, the amount of energy
used depends on a person’s weight—the average amount of energy
used by a person is 17.5 calories per pound per day. So, the more
weight a person loses, the less energy a person uses (assuming that
the person maintains a constant level of activity). An equation that
can be used to model weight loss is
where 
is the person’s weight (in pounds),
is the time in days,
and 
is the constant daily calorie consumption.
(a) Find the general solution of the differential equation.
(b) Consider a person who weighs 180 pounds and begins a diet of
2500 calories per day. How long will it take the person to lose 
10 pounds? How long will it take the person to lose 35 pounds?
(c) Use a graphing utility to graph the solution. What is the
“limiting” weight of the person?

when the diet is started.

Also, the graphs of both

To verify the reasonableness of the result

To find the area of the region between two curves that intersect at more than two
points, first determine all points of intersection. Then check to see which curve is above
the other in each interval determined by these points, as shown in Example 4.

Integration as an Accumulation Process
In this section, the integration formula for the area between two curves was developed by
using a rectangle as the representative element. For each new application in the remaining
sections of this chapter, an appropriate representative element will be constructed using
precalculus formulas you already know. Each integration formula will then be obtained
by summing or accumulating these representative elements.
For example, the area formula in this section was developed as follows.
Integration as an Accumulation Process
Find the area of the region bounded by the graph of 
and the axis. Describe
the integration as an accumulation process.
Solution
The area of the region is
You can think of the integration as an accumulation of the areas of the rectangles formed
as the representative rectangle slides from 
to 
as shown in Figure 7.11.

Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the washer method.
Find the volume of a solid with known cross sections.
The Disk Method
You have already learned that area is only one of the many applications of the definite
integral. Another important application is its use in finding the volume of a three-
dimensional solid. In this section, you will study a particular type of three-dimensional
solid—one whose cross sections are similar. Solids of revolution are used commonly in
engineering and manufacturing. Some examples are axles, funnels, pills, bottles, and
pistons, as shown in Figure 7.12.
Solids of revolution
Figure 7.12
When a region in the plane is revolved about a line, the resulting solid is a solid of
revolution, and the line is called the axis of revolution. The simplest such solid is a
right circular cylinder or disk, which is formed by revolving a rectangle about an axis
adjacent to one side of the rectangle, as shown in Figure 7.13. The volume of such a
disk is
where 
is the radius of the disk and 
is the width.
To see how to use the volume of a disk to find the volume of a general solid of 
revolution, consider a solid of revolution formed by revolving the plane region in 
Figure 7.14 about the indicated axis. To determine the volume of this solid, consider a
representative rectangle in the plane region. When this rectangle is revolved about the
axis of revolution, it generates a representative disk whose volume is 
Approximating the volume of the solid by 
such disks of width 
and radius 
produces

The Washer Method
The disk method can be extended to cover solids of revolution with holes by replacing
the representative disk with a representative washer. The washer is formed by revolving
a rectangle about an axis, as shown in Figure 7.18. If and 
are the inner and outer
radii of the washer and 
is the width of the washer, then the volume is
To see how this concept can be used to find the volume of a solid of revolution,
consider a region bounded by an outer radius
and an inner radius
as shown
in Figure 7.19. If the region is revolved about its axis of revolution, then the volume of
the resulting solid is
Washer method
Note that the integral involving the inner radius represents the volume of the hole and
is subtracted from the integral involving the outer radius.

TECHNOLOGY
Some graphing utilities have the capability of generating (or
have built-in software capable of generating) a solid of revolution. If you have access
to such a utility, use it to graph some of the solids of revolution described in this 
section. For instance, the solid in Example 4 might appear like that shown in 
Figure 7.22.

Manufacturing
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A manufacturer drills a hole through the center of a metal sphere of radius 5 inches, as
shown in Figure 7.23(a). The hole has a radius of 3 inches. What is the volume of the
resulting metal ring?
Solution
You can imagine the ring to be generated by a segment of the circle whose
equation is 
as shown in Figure 7.23(b). Because the radius of the hole is
3 inches, you can let 
and solve the equation 
to determine that the
limits of integration are 
So, the inner and outer radii are 
and
and the volume is
Solids with Known Cross Sections
With the disk method, you can find the volume of a solid having a circular cross
section whose area is 
This method can be generalized to solids of any shape,
as long as you know a formula for the area of an arbitrary cross section. Some common
cross sections are squares, rectangles, triangles, semicircles, and trapezoids.

Volume: The Shell Method
Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the shell method.
Compare the uses of the disk method and the shell method.
The Shell Method
In this section, you will study an alternative method for finding the volume of a solid
of revolution. This method is called the shell method because it uses cylindrical shells.
A comparison of the advantages of the disk and shell methods is given later in this
section.
To begin, consider a representative rectangle as shown in Figure 7.27, where 
is
the width of the rectangle,
is the height of the rectangle, and is the distance between
the axis of revolution and the center of the rectangle. When this rectangle is revolved
about its axis of revolution, it forms a cylindrical shell (or tube) of thickness 
To find
the volume of this shell, consider two cylinders. The radius of the larger cylinder 
corresponds to the outer radius of the shell, and the radius of the smaller cylinder 
corresponds to the inner radius of the shell. Because is the average radius of the shell,
you know the outer radius is
Outer radius
and the inner radius is
Inner radius
So, the volume of the shell is
You can use this formula to find the volume of a solid of revolution. For instance,
the plane region in Figure 7.28 is revolved about a line to form the indicated solid.
Consider a horizontal rectangle of width 
As the plane region is revolved 
about a line parallel to the 
axis, the rectangle generates a representative shell whose
volume is
You can approximate the volume of the solid by 
such shells of thickness 
height
and average radius 
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
So, the
volume of the solid is

Solution
Because the axis of revolution is 
vertical, use a vertical representative rectangle,
as shown in Figure 7.30. The width 
indicates
that is the variable of integration. The distance
from the center of the rectangle to the axis of 
revolution is

Using the Shell Method to Find Volume
Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded by
the graph of
and the 
axis 
about the 
axis.
Solution
Because the axis of revolution is horizontal, use a horizontal representative
rectangle, as shown in Figure 7.31. The width 
indicates that 
is the variable of 
integration. The distance from the center of the rectangle to the axis of revolution is
and the height of the rectangle is 
Because ranges from 0 to 1,

Integrate.
Comparison of Disk and Shell Methods
The disk and shell methods can be distinguished as follows. For the disk method, the
representative rectangle is always perpendicular to the axis of revolution, whereas
for the shell method, the representative rectangle is always parallel to the axis of
revolution, as shown in Figure 7.32.

Often, one method is more convenient to use than the other. The next example 
illustrates a case in which the shell method is preferable.
Shell Method Preferable
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of 
and
about the 
axis.
Solution
In Example 4 in Section 7.2, you saw that the washer method requires two
integrals to determine the volume of this solid. See Figure 7.33(a).
Apply washer method.
Simplify.
Integrate.
In Figure 7.33(b), you can see that the shell method requires only one integral to find
the volume.
Apply shell method.
Integrate.
Consider the solid formed by revolving the region in Example 3 about the vertical
line 
Would the resulting solid of revolution have a greater volume or a smaller
volume than the solid in Example 3? Without integrating, you should be able to reason
that the resulting solid would have a smaller volume because “more” of the revolved
region would be closer to the axis of revolution. To confirm this, try solving the 
integral
which gives the volume of the solid.

Volume of a Pontoon
A pontoon is to be made in the shape shown in Figure 7.34. The pontoon is designed
by rotating the graph of
about the 
axis, where and are measured in feet. Find the volume of the pontoon.
Solution
Refer to Figure 7.35 and use the disk method as shown.
Apply disk method.
Simplify.
Integrate.
To use the shell method in Example 4, you would have to solve for in terms of 
in the equation 
and then evaluate an integral that requires a -substitution.
Sometimes, solving for is very difficult (or even impossible). In such cases, you
must use a vertical rectangle (of width 
), thus making 
the variable of integration.
The position (horizontal or vertical) of the axis of revolution then determines the
method to be used. This is shown in Example 5.
Shell Method Necessary
Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of
and 
about the line 
as shown in Figure 7.36.
Solution
In the equation 
you cannot easily solve for in terms of
(See the discussion at the end of Section 3.8.) Therefore, the variable of integration
must be 
and you should choose a vertical representative rectangle. Because the 
rectangle is parallel to the axis of revolution, use the shell method.
Apply shell method.

The Oblateness of Saturn
Saturn is the most oblate of the 
planets in our solar system. Its equatorial radius is 60,268 kilometers
and its polar radius is 54,364 kilometers. The color-enhanced 
photograph of Saturn was taken by Voyager 1. In the photograph,
the oblateness of Saturn is clearly visible.

Arc Length
In this section, definite integrals are used to find the arc lengths of curves and the areas
of surfaces of revolution. In either case, an arc (a segment of a curve) is approximated
by straight line segments whose lengths are given by the familiar Distance Formula
A rectifiable curve is one that has a finite arc length. You will see that a sufficient
condition for the graph of a function to be rectifiable between

check to see that this new definition agrees with the standard Distance Formula for the
length of a line segment. This is shown in Example 1.

TECHNOLOGY
Definite integrals representing arc length often are very 
difficult to evaluate. In this section, a few examples are presented. In the next 
chapter, with more advanced integration techniques, you will be able to tackle more
difficult arc length problems. In the meantime, remember that you can always use a
numerical integration program to approximate an arc length. For instance, use the
numerical integration feature of a graphing utility to approximate arc lengths in
Examples 2 and 3.

Area of a Surface of Revolution
In Sections 7.2 and 7.3, integration was used to calculate the volume of a solid
of revolution. You will now look at a procedure for finding the area of a surface of
revolution.
The area of a surface of revolution is 
derived from the formula for the lateral surface
area of the frustum of a right circular cone.
Consider the line segment in the figure at the 
right, where 
is the length of the line segment,
is the radius at the left end of the line segment,
and 
is the radius at the right end of the line 
segment. When the line segment is revolved 
about its axis of revolution, it forms a frustum 
of a right circular cone, with
Lateral surface area of frustum

(In Exercise 54, you are asked to verify the formula for )
Consider a function that has a continuous derivative on the interval 
The
graph of is revolved about the 
axis to form a surface of revolution, as shown in
Figure 7.43. Let 
be a partition of 
with subintervals of width 
Then the line
segment of length
generates a frustum of a cone. Let 
be the average radius of this frustum. By the
Intermediate Value Theorem, a point 
exists (in the 
subinterval) such that
The lateral surface area 
of the frustum is

7.5 Work
Find the work done by a constant force.
Find the work done by a variable force.
Work Done by a Constant Force
The concept of work is important to scientists and engineers for determining the 
energy needed to perform various jobs. For instance, it is useful to know the amount of
work done when a crane lifts a steel girder, when a spring is compressed, when a 
rocket is propelled into the air, or when a truck pulls a load along a highway.
In general, work is done by a force when it moves an object. If the force applied
to the object is constant, then the definition of work is as follows.
There are four fundamental types of forces—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong
nuclear, and weak nuclear. A force can be thought of as a push or a pull; a force changes
the state of rest or state of motion of a body. For gravitational forces on Earth, it is 
common to use units of measure corresponding to the weight of an object.
Lifting an Object
Determine the work done in lifting a 50-pound object 4 feet.
Solution
The magnitude of the required force 
is the weight of the object, as shown
in Figure 7.46. So, the work done in lifting the object 4 feet is
pounds,
foot-pounds.
In the U.S. measurement system, work is typically expressed in foot-pounds
(ft-lb), inch-pounds, or foot-tons. In the International System of Units (SI), the basic
unit of force is the newton—the force required to produce an acceleration of 1 meter per
second per second on a mass of 1 kilogram. In this system, work is typically expressed
in newton-meters, also called joules. In another system, the centimeter-gram-second
(C-G-S) system, the basic unit of force is the dyne—the force required to produce an
acceleration of 1 centimeter per second per second on a mass of 1 gram. In this system,
work is typically expressed in dyne-centimeters (ergs) or newton-meters (joules).

How Much Work?
In Example 1, 200 foot-pounds of work was needed to lift
the 50-pound object 4 feet vertically off the ground. After lifting the object, you
carry it a horizontal distance of 4 feet. Would this require an additional 
200 foot-pounds of work? Explain your reasoning.

Work Done by a Variable Force
In Example 1, the force involved was constant. When a variable force is applied to an
object, calculus is needed to determine the work done, because the amount of force
changes as the object changes position. For instance, the force required to compress a
spring increases as the spring is compressed.
Consider an object that is moved along a straight line from 
to 
by a
continuously varying force 
Let 
be a partition that divides the interval 
into
subintervals determined by
and let 
For each 
choose 
such that
Then at 
the force is 
Because 
is continuous, you can approximate the work
done in moving the object through the th subinterval by the increment
as shown in Figure 7.47. So, the total work 
done as the object moves from to is 
approximated by
This approximation appears to become better 
and better as 
So, the work 
done is
The remaining examples in this section use some well-known physical laws. The
discoveries of many of these laws occurred during the same period in which calculus
was being developed. In fact, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there was
little difference between physicists and mathematicians. One such physicist-
mathematician was Emilie de Breteuil. Breteuil was instrumental in synthesizing the
work of many other scientists, including Newton, Leibniz, Huygens, Kepler, and
Descartes. Her physics text Institutions was widely used for many years.

The three laws of physics listed below were developed by Robert Hooke
(1635–1703), Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and Charles Coulomb (1736–1806).
1. Hooke’s Law: The force 
required to compress or stretch a spring (within its 
elastic limits) is proportional to the distance 
that the spring is compressed or
stretched from its original length. That is,
where the constant of proportionality 
(the spring constant) depends on the 
specific nature of the spring.
2. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: The force 
of attraction between two
particles of masses 
and 
is proportional to the product of the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two particles. That is,
When 
and 
are in kilograms and 
in meters,
will be in newtons for a value
of 
cubic meter per kilogram-second squared, where 
is the 
gravitational constant.
3. Coulomb’s Law: The force 
between two charges 
and 
in a vacuum is
proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between the two charges. That is,
When 
and 
are given in electrostatic units and 
in centimeters,
will be in
dynes for a value of 
Compressing a Spring
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A force of 750 pounds compresses a spring 3 inches from its natural length of 
15 inches. Find the work done in compressing the spring an additional 3 inches.
Solution
By Hooke’s Law, the force 
required to compress the spring 
units
(from its natural length) is 
Because 
it follows that
So,
as shown in Figure 7.48. To find the increment of work, assume that
the force required to compress the spring over a small increment 
is nearly constant.
So, the increment of work is
Because the spring is compressed from 
to 
inches less than its natural
length, the work required is
inch-pounds.
Note that you do not integrate from 
to 
because you were asked to
determine the work done in compressing the spring an additional 3 inches (not
including the first 3 inches).

Moving a Space Module into Orbit
A space module weighs 15 metric tons on the 
surface of Earth. How much work is done in 
propelling the module to a height of 800 miles 
above Earth, as shown in Figure 7.49? (Use 
4000 miles as the radius of Earth. Do not consider 
the effect of air resistance or the weight of the 
propellant.)
Solution
Because the weight of a body varies
inversely as the square of its distance from the 
center of Earth, the force 
exerted by 
gravity is
where 
is the constant of proportionality. Because the module weighs 15 metric tons
on the surface of Earth and the radius of Earth is approximately 4000 miles, you have
So, the increment of work is
Finally, because the module is propelled from 
to 
miles, the total
work done is

In SI units, using a conversion factor of 1 foot-pound
joules, the work done is
joules.
The solutions to Examples 2 and 3 conform to our development of work as the
summation of increments in the form
Another way to formulate the increment of work is
This second interpretation of 
is useful in problems involving the movement of 
nonrigid substances such as fluids and chains.

Emptying a Tank of Oil
A spherical tank of radius 8 feet is half full of oil
that weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot. Find the 
work required to pump oil out through a hole in 
the top of the tank.
Solution
Consider the oil to be subdivided 
into disks of thickness 
and radius 
as shown 
in Figure 7.50. Because the increment of force 
for each disk is given by its weight, you have
For a circle of radius 8 and center at

and you can write the force increment as
In Figure 7.50, note that a disk 
feet from the bottom of the tank must be moved a 
distance of 
feet. So, the increment of work is
Because the tank is half full,
ranges from 0 to 8, and the work required to empty the
tank is
To estimate the reasonableness of the result in Example 4, consider that the weight of
the oil in the tank is
Lifting the entire half-tank of oil 8 feet would involve work of

foot-pounds.
Because the oil is actually lifted between 8 and 16 feet, it seems reasonable that the
work done is about 589,782 foot-pounds.

Lifting a Chain
A 20-foot chain weighing 5 pounds per foot is lying coiled on the ground. How much
work is required to raise one end of the chain to a height of 20 feet so that it is fully
extended, as shown in Figure 7.51?
Solution
Imagine that the chain is divided into small sections, each of length 
Then the weight of each section is the increment of force
Because a typical section (initially on the ground) is raised to a height of 
the 
increment of work is
Because ranges from 0 to 20, the total work is
In the next example, you will consider a piston of radius in a cylindrical casing,
as shown in Figure 7.52. As the gas in the cylinder expands, the piston moves, and work
is done. If 
represents the pressure of the gas (in pounds per square foot) against the
piston head and 
represents the volume of the gas (in cubic feet), then the work 
increment involved in moving the piston 
feet is
So, as the volume of the gas expands from 
to 
the work done in moving the 
piston is
Assuming the pressure of the gas to be inversely proportional to its volume, you have
and the integral for work becomes

A quantity of gas with an initial volume of 1 cubic foot and a pressure of 500 pounds

Tidal power plants use “tidal energy” to produce electrical energy.
To construct a tidal power plant, a dam is built to separate a basin
from the sea. Electrical energy is produced as the water flows back
and forth between the basin and the sea. The amount of “natural
energy” produced depends on the volume of the basin and the tidal
range—the vertical distance between high and low tides. (Several
natural basins have tidal ranges in excess of 15 feet; the Bay of
Fundy in Nova Scotia has a tidal range of 53 feet.)
(a) Consider a basin with a rectangular base, as shown in the 
figure. The basin has a tidal range of 25 feet, with low tide 
corresponding to 
How much water does the basin hold
at high tide?
(b) The amount of energy produced during the filling (or the 
emptying) of the basin is proportional to the amount of work
required to fill (or empty) the basin. How much work is required
to fill the basin with seawater? (Use a seawater density of 
64 pounds per cubic foot.)
The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia has an extreme tidal range,
as displayed in the greatly contrasting photos above.

Mass
In this section, you will study several important applications of integration that are 
related to mass. Mass is a measure of a body’s resistance to changes in motion, and is
independent of the particular gravitational system in which the body is located. However,
because so many applications involving mass occur on Earth’s surface, an object’s mass
is sometimes equated with its weight. This is not technically correct. Weight is a type of
force and as such is dependent on gravity. Force and mass are related by the equation
The table below lists some commonly used measures of mass and force, together with
their conversion factors.
Mass on the Surface of Earth
Find the mass (in slugs) of an object whose weight at sea level is 1 pound.
Solution
Use 32 feet per second per second as the acceleration due to gravity.
Because many applications involving mass occur on Earth’s surface, this amount of
mass is called a pound mass.

Center of Mass in a One-Dimensional System
You will now consider two types of moments of a mass—the moment about a point
and the moment about a line. To define these two moments, consider an idealized
situation in which a mass 
is concentrated at a point. If is the distance between this
point mass and another point 
then the moment of m about the point P is
and is the length of the moment arm.
The concept of moment can be demonstrated simply by a seesaw, as shown in
Figure 7.53. A child of mass 20 kilograms sits 2 meters to the left of fulcrum 
and an
older child of mass 30 kilograms sits 2 meters to the right of 
From experience, you
know that the seesaw will begin to rotate clockwise, moving the larger child down. This
rotation occurs because the moment produced by the child on the left is less than the
moment produced by the child on the right.
kilogram-meters
kilogram-meters
To balance the seesaw, the two moments must be equal. For example, if the larger child
moved to a position meters from the fulcrum, then the seesaw would balance, because
each child would produce a moment of 40 kilogram-meters.
To generalize this, you can introduce a coordinate line on which the origin
corresponds to the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 7.54. Several point masses are located
on the 
axis. The measure of the tendency of this system to rotate about the origin is
the moment about the origin, and it is defined as the sum of the products 
The
moment about the origin is denoted by 
and can be written as
If 
is 0, then the system is said to be in equilibrium.
If 
then the system is in equilibrium.
Figure 7.54
For a system that is not in equilibrium, the center of mass is defined as the point
at which the fulcrum could be relocated to attain equilibrium. If the system were 
translated units, then each coordinate 
would become
and because the moment of the translated system is 0, you have
Solving for produces

Rather than define the moment of a mass, you could define the moment of a force.
In this context, the center of mass is called the center of gravity. Consider a system of
point masses 
that is located at 
Then, because
the total force of the system is

Center of Mass in a Two-Dimensional System
You can extend the concept of moment to two dimensions by considering a system of
masses located in the 
plane at the points 
as shown in
Figure 7.56. Rather than defining a single moment (with respect to the origin), two
moments are defined—one with respect to the 
axis and one with respect to the
axis.
The moment of a system of masses in the plane can be taken about any horizontal
or vertical line. In general, the moment about a line is the sum of the product of the
masses and the directed distances from the points to the line.

Center of Mass of a Planar Lamina
So far in this section, you have assumed the total mass of a system to be distributed at
discrete points in a plane or on a line. Now consider a thin, flat plate of material of 
constant density called a planar lamina (see Figure 7.58). Density is a measure of
mass per unit of volume, such as grams per cubic centimeter. For planar laminas,
however, density is considered to be a measure of mass per unit of area. Density is 
denoted by 
the lowercase Greek letter rho.
Consider an irregularly shaped planar lamina 
of uniform density 
bounded by the graphs of
and 
as shown in
Figure 7.59. The mass of this region is
where 
is the area of the region. To find the 
center of mass of this lamina, partition the 
interval 
into subintervals of equal width 
Let 
be the center of the 
subinterval. 
You can approximate the portion of the lamina 
lying in the 
subinterval by a rectangle whose 
height is 
Because the density 
of the rectangle is 
its mass is
Density

Width
Now, considering this mass to be located at the center 
of the rectangle, the directed
distance from the axis to 
is 
So, the moment of

You can think of the center of mass
of a lamina as its balancing point.

The Center of Mass of a Planar Lamina
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the center of mass of the lamina of uniform density 
bounded by the graph of
and the 
axis.
Solution
Because the center of mass lies on the axis of symmetry, you know that
Moreover, the mass of the lamina is
To find the moment about the 
axis, place a 
representative rectangle in the region, as shown 
in the figure at the right. The distance from 
the 
axis to the center of this rectangle is
Because the mass of the representative rectangle
is
you have
and is
So, the center of mass (the balancing point) of the lamina is 
as shown in
Figure 7.60.
The density in Example 4 is a common factor of both the moments and the mass,
and as such divides out of the quotients representing the coordinates of the center of
mass. So, the center of mass of a lamina of uniform density depends only on the shape
of the lamina and not on its density. For this reason, the point
Center of mass or centroid
is sometimes called the center of mass of a region in the plane, or the centroid of the
region. In other words, to find the centroid of a region in the plane, you simply assume
that the region has a constant density of 
and compute the corresponding center
of mass.

Theorem of Pappus
The final topic in this section is a useful theorem credited to Pappus of Alexandria 
(ca. 300 A.D.), a Greek mathematician whose eight-volume Mathematical Collection is
a record of much of classical Greek mathematics. You are asked to prove this theorem
in Section 14.4.
The Theorem of Pappus can be used to find the volume of a torus, as shown in the
next example. Recall that a torus is a doughnut-shaped solid formed by revolving a 
circular region about a line that lies in the same plane as the circle (but does not 
intersect the circle).
Finding Volume by the Theorem of Pappus
Find the volume of the torus shown in Figure 7.64(a), which was formed by revolving
the circular region bounded by 
about the 
axis, as shown in Figure 7.64(b).

Solution

Fluid Pressure and Fluid Force
Find fluid pressure and fluid force.
Fluid Pressure and Fluid Force
Swimmers know that the deeper an object is submerged in a fluid, the greater the
pressure on the object. Pressure is defined as the force per unit of area over the surface
of a body. For example, because a column of water that is 10 feet in height and 1 inch
square weighs 4.3 pounds, the fluid pressure at a depth of 10 feet of water is 4.3 pounds
per square inch.* At 20 feet, this would increase to 8.6 pounds per square inch, and in
general the pressure is proportional to the depth of the object in the fluid.
Below are some common weight-densities of fluids in pounds per cubic foot.

When calculating fluid pressure, you can use an important (and rather surprising)
physical law called Pascal’s Principle, named after the French mathematician Blaise
Pascal. Pascal’s Principle states that the pressure exerted by a fluid at a depth 
is 
transmitted equally in all directions. For example, in Figure 7.65, the pressure at the
indicated depth is the same for all three objects. Because fluid pressure is given in terms
of force per unit area 
the fluid force on a submerged horizontal surface of
area 
is
Fluid force
(pressure)(area).
The pressure at is the same for all three objects.

* The total pressure on an object in 10 feet of water would also include the pressure due
to Earth’s atmosphere. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is approximately 14.7 pounds per

BLAISE PASCAL (1623–1662)
Pascal is well known for his work
in many areas of mathematics and
physics, and also for his influence
on Leibniz. Although much of
Pascal’s work in calculus was 
intuitive and lacked the rigor of
modern mathematics, he 
nevertheless anticipated many
important results.

Fluid Force on a Submerged Sheet
Find the fluid force on a rectangular metal sheet measuring 3 feet by 4 feet that is
submerged in 6 feet of water, as shown in Figure 7.66.
Solution
Because the weight-density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot and the
sheet is submerged in 6 feet of water, the fluid pressure is
Because the total area of the sheet is 
square feet, the fluid force is
This result is independent of the size of the body of water. The fluid force would be
the same in a swimming pool or lake.
In Example 1, the fact that the sheet is rectangular and horizontal means that you
do not need the methods of calculus to solve the problem. Consider a surface that is 
submerged vertically in a fluid. This problem is more difficult because the pressure 
is not constant over the surface.
Consider a vertical plate that is submerged in
a fluid of weight-density 
(per unit of volume),
as shown in Figure 7.67. To determine the total
force against one side of the region from depth 
to depth 
you can subdivide the interval 
into subintervals, each of width 
Next,
consider the representative rectangle of width 
and length 
where 
is in the th 
subinterval. The force against this representative
rectangle is
The force against such rectangles is
Note that 
is considered to be constant and is factored out of the summation.
Therefore, taking the limit as 
suggests the next definition.

Fluid Force on a Vertical Surface
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A vertical gate in a dam has the shape of an
isosceles trapezoid 8 feet across the top and 
6 feet across the bottom, with a height of 
5 feet, as shown in Figure 7.68(a). What is 
the fluid force on the gate when the top of the
gate is 4 feet below the surface of the water?
Solution
In setting up a mathematical model
for this problem, you are at liberty to locate the 
and 
axes in several different ways. A 
convenient approach is to let the -axis bisect 
the gate and place the 
axis at the surface of 
the water, as shown in Figure 7.68(b). So, the 
depth of the water at in feet is
To find the length 
of the region at 
find 
the equation of the line forming the right side 
of the gate. Because this line passes through 
the points 
and 
its equation is
In Figure 7.68(b) you can see that the length of the region at is
Finally, by integrating from 
to 
you can calculate the fluid force to be
In Example 2, the axis coincided with the surface of the water. This was convenient,
but arbitrary. In choosing a coordinate system to represent a physical situation, you
should consider various possibilities. Often you can simplify the calculations in a problem
by locating the coordinate system to take advantage of special characteristics of the
problem, such as symmetry.

Fluid Force on a Vertical Surface
A circular observation window on a marine science ship has a radius of 1 foot, and the
center of the window is 8 feet below water level, as shown in Figure 7.69. What is the
fluid force on the window?
Solution
To take advantage of symmetry, locate a coordinate system such that the
origin coincides with the center of the window, as shown in Figure 7.69. The depth at
is then
The horizontal length of the window is 
and you can use the equation for the 
circle,
to solve for as shown.
Finally, because 
ranges from 
to 
and using 64 pounds per cubic foot as the
weight-density of seawater, you have
Initially it looks as though this integral would be difficult to solve. However, when you
break the integral into two parts and apply symmetry, the solution is simpler.
The second integral is 0 (because the integrand is odd and the limits of integration are
symmetric with respect to the origin). Moreover, by recognizing that the first integral
represents the area of a semicircle of radius 1, you obtain
So, the fluid force on the window is about 1608.5 pounds.

11. Archimedes’ Principle
Archimedes’ Principle states
that the upward or buoyant force on an object within a fluid is
equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. For a
partially submerged object, you can obtain information about
the relative densities of the floating object and the fluid by
observing how much of the object is above and below the 
surface. You can also determine the size of a floating object if
you know the amount that is above the surface and the relative
densities. You can see the top of a floating iceberg (see figure).
The density of ocean water is 
kilograms per cubic
meter, and that of ice is 
kilograms per cubic meter.
What percent of the total iceberg is below the surface?

Fitting Integrands to Basic Integration Rules
In this chapter, you will study several integration techniques that greatly expand the set
of integrals to which the basic integration rules can be applied. These rules are reviewed
at the left. A major step in solving any integration problem is recognizing which basic
integration rule to use.

Using Two Basic Rules to Solve a Single Integral
Evaluate 
Solution
Begin by writing the integral as the sum of two integrals. Then apply the
Power Rule and the Arcsine Rule.
See Figure 8.1.
Rules 18, 19, and 20 of the basic integration rules on the preceding page all have
expressions involving the sum or difference of two squares:
and
These expressions are often apparent after a -substitution, as shown in Example 3.

Simpson’s Rule can be used to give a good approximation of
the value of the integral in Example 2 (for 
the approximation is 1.839).
When using numerical integration, however, you should be aware that Simpson’s
Rule does not always give good approximations when one or both of the limits of
integration are near a vertical asymptote. For instance, using the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, you can obtain
For 
Simpson’s Rule gives an approximation of 6.889.

Two of the most commonly overlooked integration rules are the Log Rule and the
Power Rule. Notice in the next two examples how these two integration rules can be
disguised.
A Disguised Form of the Log Rule
Find 
Solution
The integral does not appear to fit any of the basic rules. The quotient form,
however, suggests the Log Rule. If you let 
then 
You can obtain
the required 
by adding and subtracting 
in the numerator.

Integrate.
There is usually more than one way to solve an integration problem. For instance,
in Example 4, try integrating by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 
to
obtain an integral of the form 
See if you can get the same answer by this 
procedure. (Be careful: the answer will appear in a different form.)
A Disguised Form of the Power Rule

Solution
Again, the integral does not appear to fit any of the basic rules. However,
considering the two primary choices for

Find an antiderivative using integration by parts.
Integration by Parts
In this section, you will study an important integration technique called integration by
parts. This technique can be applied to a wide variety of functions and is particularly
useful for integrands involving products of algebraic and transcendental functions. For
instance, integration by parts works well with integrals such as
and
Integration by parts is based on the formula for the derivative of a product
where both and are differentiable functions of 
When 
and 
are continuous, you
can integrate both sides of this equation to obtain
By rewriting this equation, you obtain the next theorem.
This formula expresses the original integral in terms of another integral. Depending on
the choices of 
and 
it may be easier to evaluate the second integral than the 
original one. Because the choices of 
and 
are critical in the integration by parts
process, the guidelines below are provided.
When using integration by parts, note that you can first choose 
or first choose
After you choose, however, the choice of the other factor is determined—it must be
the remaining portion of the integrand. Also note that 
must contain the differential
of the original integral.

TECHNOLOGY
Remember that there are two ways to use technology to 
evaluate a definite integral: (1) you can use a numerical approximation such as the
Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule, or (2) you can use a computer algebra system
to find the antiderivative and then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Both
methods have shortcomings. To find the possible error when using a numerical
method, the integrand must have a second derivative (Trapezoidal Rule) or a fourth
derivative (Simpson’s Rule) in the interval of integration; the integrand in Example 3
fails to meet either of these requirements. To apply the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, the symbolic integration utility must be able to find the antiderivative.

Some integrals require repeated use of the integration by parts formula.
Repeated Use of Integration by Parts
Find 
Solution
The factors 
and sin 
are equally easy to integrate. However, the
derivative of 
becomes simpler, whereas the derivative of sin 
does not. So, you
should let 
Now, integration by parts produces
First use of integration by parts
This first use of integration by parts has succeeded in simplifying the original integral,
but the integral on the right still doesn’t fit a basic integration rule. To evaluate that 
integral, you can apply integration by parts again. This time, let 
Now, integration by parts produces
Second use of integration by parts
Combining these two results, you can write
When making repeated applications of integration by parts, you need to be careful
not to interchange the substitutions in successive applications. For instance, in Example 4,
the first substitution was 
and 
If, in the second application, you
had switched the substitution to 
and 
you would have obtained
thereby undoing the previous integration and returning to the original integral. When
making repeated applications of integration by parts, you should also watch for the
appearance of a constant multiple of the original integral. For instance, this occurs when
you use integration by parts to evaluate 
and it also occurs in Example 5
on the next page.
The integral in Example 5 is an important one. In Section 8.4 (Example 5), you will
see that it is used to find the arc length of a parabolic segment.

In this section, you will study techniques for evaluating integrals of the form
and
where either 
or 
is a positive integer. To find antiderivatives for these forms, try to
break them into combinations of trigonometric integrals to which you can apply the
Power Rule.
For instance, you can evaluate

JOHN WALLIS (1616–1703)
Wallis did much of his work in
calculus prior to Newton and
Leibniz, and he influenced the
thinking of both of these men.
Wallis is also credited with 
introducing the present symbol
for infinity.

GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING INTEGRALS INVOLVING POWERS OF SECANT AND TANGENT
1. When the power of the secant is even and positive, save a secant-squared factor and convert the remaining factors 
to tangents. Then, expand and integrate.
Even
Convert to tangents
Save for 
2. When the power of the tangent is odd and positive, save a secant-tangent factor and convert the remaining factors 
to secants. Then, expand and integrate.
Odd
Convert to secants
Save for 
3. When there are no secant factors and the power of the tangent is even and positive, convert a tangent-squared 
factor to a secant-squared factor, then expand and repeat if necessary.
Convert to secants
4. When the integral is of the form
where 
is odd and positive, use integration by parts, as illustrated in Example 5 in Section 8.2.
5. When none of the first four guidelines applies, try converting to sines and cosines.

Power of Secant Is Even and Positive
Find 
Solution
Let 
then 
and you can write
In Example 5, the power of the tangent is odd and positive. So, you could also find
the integral using the procedure described in the second guideline on page 527. In
Exercises 69 and 70, you are asked to show that the results obtained by these two 
procedures differ only by a constant.
Power of Tangent Is Even
Evaluate 
Solution
Because there are no secant factors, you can begin by converting a tangent-
squared factor to a secant-squared factor.
Next, evaluate the definite integral.
The area represented by the definite integral is shown in Figure 8.5. Try using
Simpson’s Rule to approximate this integral. With 
you should obtain an
approximation that is within 0.00001 of the actual value.

For integrals involving powers of cotangents and cosecants, you can follow a 
strategy similar to that used for powers of tangents and secants. Also, when integrating
trigonometric functions, remember that it sometimes helps to convert the entire 
integrand to powers of sines and cosines.
Converting to Sines and Cosines
Find 
Solution
Because the first four guidelines on page 527 do not apply, try converting
the integrand to sines and cosines. In this case, you are able to integrate the resulting
powers of sine and cosine as shown.
Integrals Involving Sine-Cosine Products with Different
Angles
Integrals involving the products of sines and cosines of two different angles occur in many
applications. In such instances, you can use the following product-to-sum identities.

Power lines are constructed by stringing wire between supports and
adjusting the tension on each span. The wire hangs between 
supports in the shape of a catenary, as shown in the figure.
Let 
be the tension (in pounds) on a span of wire, let 
be the 
density (in pounds per foot), let 
be the acceleration due
to gravity (in feet per second per second), and let 
be the distance
(in feet) between the supports. Then the equation of the catenary is
where and are measured in feet.
(a) Find the length of the wire between two spans.
(b) To measure the tension in a span, power line workers use the

8.4 Trigonometric Substitution
Use trigonometric substitution to solve an integral.
Use integrals to model and solve real-life applications.
Trigonometric Substitution
Now that you can evaluate integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions, you
can use trigonometric substitution to evaluate integrals involving the radicals
and
The objective with trigonometric substitution is to eliminate the radical in the integrand.
You do this by using the Pythagorean identities.
For example, for 
let 
where 
Then
Note that 
because 
The restrictions on 
ensure that the function that defines the substitution is 
one-to-one. In fact, these are the same intervals over which the arcsine, arctangent, and
arcsecant are defined.

When using trigonometric substitution to evaluate definite integrals, you must be
careful to check that the values of lie in the intervals discussed at the beginning of this
section. For instance, if in Example 4 you had been asked to evaluate the definite integral
then using 
and 
in the interval 
would imply that 
So, when determining the upper and lower limits of integration, you would have to
choose such that 
In this case, the integral would be evaluated as shown.
Trigonometric substitution can be used with completing the square. For instance,
try finding the integral
To begin, you could complete the square and write the integral as 
Because the integrand has the form
with 
and 
you can now use trigonometric substitution to find the 
integral.
Trigonometric substitution can be used to evaluate the three integrals listed in the
next theorem. These integrals will be encountered several times in the remainder of the
text. When this happens, we will simply refer to this theorem. (In Exercise 71, you are
asked to verify the formulas given in the theorem.)

Comparing Two Fluid Forces
A sealed barrel of oil (weighing 48 pounds per cubic foot) is floating in seawater
(weighing 64 pounds per cubic foot), as shown in Figures 8.11 and 8.12. (The barrel is
not completely full of oil. With the barrel lying on its side, the top 0.2 foot of the 
barrel is empty.) Compare the fluid forces against one end of the barrel from the inside
and from the outside.
Solution
In Figure 8.12, locate the coordinate system with the origin at the center of
the circle
To find the fluid force against an end of the barrel from the inside, integrate between
and 0.8 (using a weight of 
).
General equation (See Section 7.7.)
To find the fluid force from the outside, integrate between 
and 0.4 (using a weight
of 
).
The details of integration are left for you to complete in Exercise 70. Intuitively, would
you say that the force from the oil (the inside) or the force from the seawater (the 
outside) is greater? By evaluating these two integrals, you can determine that

Understand the concept of partial fraction decomposition.
Use partial fraction decomposition with linear factors to integrate rational functions.
Use partial fraction decomposition with quadratic factors to integrate rational 
functions.
Partial Fractions
This section examines a procedure for decomposing a rational function into simpler
rational functions to which you can apply the basic integration formulas. This
procedure is called the method of partial fractions. To see the benefit of the method
of partial fractions, consider the integral
To evaluate this integral without partial fractions, you can complete the square and use
trigonometric substitution (see Figure 8.13) to obtain
Now, suppose you had observed that
Partial fraction decomposition
Then you could evaluate the integral, as shown.
This method is clearly preferable to trigonometric substitution. Its use, however,
depends on the ability to factor the denominator,
and to find the partial
fractions
and
In this section, you will study techniques for finding partial fraction decompositions.

JOHN BERNOULLI (1667–1748)
The method of partial fractions
was introduced by John Bernoulli,
a Swiss mathematician who was
instrumental in the early 
development of calculus. John
Bernoulli was a professor at the
University of Basel and taught
many outstanding students, the
most famous of whom was
Leonhard Euler.

Recall from algebra that every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored
into linear and irreducible quadratic factors.* For instance, the polynomial 
can be written as
where 
is a linear factor,
is a repeated linear factor, and 
is an
irreducible quadratic factor. Using this factorization, you can write the partial fraction
decomposition of the rational expression
where 
is a polynomial of degree less than 5, as shown.

when the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the 
denominator), divide the denominator into the numerator to obtain
where the degree of

the partial fraction
decomposition must include the following sum of 
fractions.

Linear Factors
Algebraic techniques for determining the constants in the numerators of a partial 
fraction decomposition with linear or repeated linear factors are shown in 
Examples 1 and 2.
Distinct Linear Factors

Because 
you should include one partial
fraction for each factor and write

Because this equation is to be true for all 
you can substitute any convenient values

The most convenient values are the ones that make

So, the decomposition is

Be sure you see that the method of partial fractions is practical only for integrals
of rational functions whose denominators factor “nicely.” For instance, when the
denominator in Example 1 is changed to
its factorization as
would be too cumbersome to use with partial fractions. In such cases, you should use
completing the square or a computer algebra system to perform the integration. When
you do this, you should obtain

that made the linear factors equal to 0. This method works well when the
partial fraction decomposition involves linear factors. When the decomposition involves
only quadratic factors, however, an alternative procedure is often more convenient. For
instance, try writing the right side of the basic equation in polynomial form and 
equating the coefficients of like terms. This method is shown in Example 4.
Repeated Quadratic Factors
Find 
Solution
Include one partial fraction for each power of 
and write
Multiplying by the least common denominator 
yields the basic equation
Expanding the basic equation and collecting like terms produces
Now, you can equate the coefficients of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.
Using the known values 
and 
you can write
Finally, you can conclude that

When integrating rational expressions, keep in mind that for improper rational
expressions such as
you must first divide to obtain
The proper rational expression is then decomposed into its partial fractions by the usual
methods. 
Here are some guidelines for solving the basic equation that is obtained in a partial
fraction decomposition.
Before concluding this section, here are a few things you should remember. First,
it is not necessary to use the partial fractions technique on all rational functions. For
instance, the following integral is evaluated more easily by the Log Rule.
Second, when the integrand is not in reduced form, reducing it may eliminate the need
for partial fractions, as shown in the following integral.
Finally, partial fractions can be used with some quotients involving transcendental 
functions. For instance, the substitution 
allows you to write

Integration by Tables
So far in this chapter, you have studied several integration techniques that can be used
with the basic integration rules. But merely knowing how to use the various techniques
is not enough. You also need to know when to use them. Integration is first and 
foremost a problem of recognition. That is, you must recognize which rule or technique
to apply to obtain an antiderivative. Frequently, a slight alteration of an integrand will
require a different integration technique (or produce a function whose antiderivative is
not an elementary function), as shown below.
Integration by parts
Power Rule
Log Rule
Not an elementary function
Many people find tables of integrals to be a valuable supplement to the integration
techniques discussed in this chapter. Tables of common integrals can be found in
Appendix B. Integration by tables is not a “cure-all” for all of the difficulties that can
accompany integration—using tables of integrals requires considerable thought and
insight and often involves substitution.
Each integration formula in Appendix B can be developed using one or more of the
techniques in this chapter. You should try to verify several of the formulas. For instance,
Formula 4
Formula 4
can be verified using the method of partial fractions, Formula 19

can be verified using integration by parts, and Formula 84

can be verified using substitution. Note that the integrals in Appendix B are classified
according to the form of the integrand. Several of the forms are listed below.

TECHNOLOGY A computer
algebra system consists, in part,
of a database of integration 
formulas. The primary 
difference between using a 
computer algebra system and
using tables of integrals is that
with a computer algebra system,
the computer searches through
the database to find a fit. With
integration tables, you must do
the searching.

8.7 Indeterminate Forms and L’Hôpital’s Rule
Recognize limits that produce indeterminate forms.
Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule to evaluate a limit.
Indeterminate Forms
Recall that the forms 
and 
are called indeterminate because they do not 
guarantee that a limit exists, nor do they indicate what the limit is, if one does exist.
When you encountered one of these indeterminate forms earlier in the text, you
attempted to rewrite the expression by using various algebraic techniques.
Indeterminate
Form
Limit
Algebraic Technique
Occasionally, you can extend these algebraic techniques to find limits of
transcendental functions. For instance, the limit
produces the indeterminate form 
Factoring and then dividing produces
Not all indeterminate forms, however, can be evaluated by algebraic manipulation. This
is often true when both algebraic and transcendental functions are involved. For
instance, the limit
produces the indeterminate form 
Rewriting the expression to obtain
merely produces another indeterminate form,
Of course, you could use 
technology to estimate the limit, as shown in the table and in Figure 8.15. From the
table and the graph, the limit appears to be 2. (This limit will be verified in Example 1.)

L’Hôpital’s Rule
To find the limit illustrated in Figure 8.15, you can use a theorem called L’Hôpital’s
Rule. This theorem states that under certain conditions, the limit of the quotient
is determined by the limit of the quotient of the derivatives
To prove this theorem, you can use a more general result called the Extended Mean
Value Theorem.
To see why Theorem 8.3 is called the Extended Mean Value Theorem, consider the
special case in which 
For this case, you obtain the “standard” Mean Value
Theorem as presented in Section 3.2.
People occasionally use L’Hôpital’s Rule incorrectly by applying the Quotient
Rule to 
Be sure you see that the rule involves
not the derivative of 
L’Hôpital’s Rule can also be applied to one-sided limits. For instance, if the limit
of 
as 
approaches 
from the right produces the indeterminate form 
then
provided the limit exists (or is infinite).

GUILLAUME L’HÔPITAL (1661–1704)
L’Hôpital’s Rule is named after the
French mathematician Guillaume
François Antoine de L’Hôpital.
L’Hôpital is credited with writing
the first text on differential 
calculus (in 1696) in which the
rule publicly appeared. It was
recently discovered that the rule
and its proof were written in a
letter from John Bernoulli to
L’Hôpital.“… I acknowledge that 
I owe very much to the bright
minds of the Bernoulli brothers.
… I have made free use of their
discoveries …,” said L’Hôpital.
See LarsonCalculus.com to read
more of this biography.

Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 
you can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule, as shown below.
Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
Differentiate numerator and denominator.
Evaluate the limit.
In the solution to Example 1, note that you actually do not know that the first limit
is equal to the second limit until you have shown that the second limit exists. In other
words, if the second limit had not existed, then it would not have been permissible to
apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
Another form of L’Hôpital’s Rule states that if the limit of 
as approaches
(or 
) produces the indeterminate form

Occasionally it is necessary to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule more than once to remove
an indeterminate form, as shown in Example 3.
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule More than Once
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 
you
can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
This limit yields the indeterminate form 
so you can apply L’Hôpital’s
Rule again to obtain
In addition to the forms 
and 
there are other indeterminate forms such
as 
and 
For example, consider the following four limits
that lead to the indeterminate form 
Limit is 1.
Limit is 2.
Limit is 0.
Limit is 
Because each limit is different, it is clear that the form 
is indeterminate in the
sense that it does not determine the value (or even the existence) of the limit. The 
remaining examples in this section show methods for evaluating these forms. Basically,
you attempt to convert each of these forms to 
or 
so that L’Hôpital’s Rule can
be applied.
Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution produces the indeterminate form 
you
should try to rewrite the limit to fit the form 
or 
In this case, you can rewrite
the limit to fit the second form.
Now, by L’Hôpital’s Rule, you have
Differentiate numerator and denominator.
Simplify.
Evaluate the limit.

When rewriting a limit in one of the forms 
or 
does not seem to work,
try the other form. For instance, in Example 4, you can write the limit as
which yields the indeterminate form 
As it happens, applying L’Hôpital’s Rule to
this limit produces
which also yields the indeterminate form 
The indeterminate forms 
and 
arise from limits of functions that have
variable bases and variable exponents. When you previously encountered this type of
function, you used logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative. You can use a
similar procedure when taking limits, as shown in the next example.
Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form 
you can 
proceed as follows. To begin, assume that the limit exists and is equal to 
Taking the natural logarithm of each side produces
Because the natural logarithmic function is continuous, you can write

TECHNOLOGY
When evaluating complicated limits such as the one in
Example 6, it is helpful to check the reasonableness of the solution with a graphing
utility. For instance, the calculations in the table and the graph in the figure (see
below) are consistent with the conclusion that 
approaches 1 as approaches
0 from the right.
Use a graphing utility to estimate the limits 
and 
Then
try to verify your estimates analytically.

Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form 
you
should try to rewrite the expression to produce a form to which you can apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule. In this case, you can combine the two fractions to obtain
Now, because direct substitution produces the indeterminate form 
you can apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule to obtain
This limit also yields the indeterminate form 
so you can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule
again to obtain
The forms 
and 
have been identified as
indeterminate. There are similar forms that you should recognize as “determinate.”
Limit is positive infinity.
Limit is negative infinity.
Limit is zero.
Limit is positive infinity.
(You are asked to verify two of these in Exercises 108 and 109.)
As a final comment, remember that L’Hôpital’s Rule can be applied only to
quotients leading to the indeterminate forms 
and 
For instance, the 
application of L’Hôpital’s Rule shown below is incorrect.
Incorrect use of L’Hôpital’s Rule
The reason this application is incorrect is that, even though the limit of the denominator
is 0, the limit of the numerator is 1, which means that the hypotheses of L’Hôpital’s Rule
have not been satisfied.

8.8 Improper Integrals
Evaluate an improper integral that has an infinite limit of integration.
Evaluate an improper integral that has an infinite discontinuity.
Improper Integrals with Infinite Limits of Integration
The definition of a definite integral
requires that the interval 
be finite. Furthermore, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, by which you have been evaluating definite integrals, requires that 
be
continuous on 
In this section, you will study a procedure for evaluating integrals
that do not satisfy these requirements—usually because either one or both of the limits
of integration are infinite, or because has a finite number of infinite discontinuities 
in the interval 
Integrals that possess either property are improper integrals.
Note that a function is said to have an infinite discontinuity at when, from the right
or left,
or
To get an idea of how to evaluate an improper integral, consider the integral
which can be interpreted as the area of the shaded region shown in Figure 8.17. Taking
the limit as 
produces
This improper integral can be interpreted as the area of the unbounded region between
the graph of 
and the 
axis (to the right of

Sending a Space Module into Orbit
In Example 3 in Section 7.5, you found that it would require 10,000 mile-tons of work
to propel a 15-metric-ton space module to a height of 800 miles above Earth. How
much work is required to propel the module an unlimited distance away from Earth’s
surface?
Solution
At first you might think that an infinite amount of work would be required.
But if this were the case, it would be impossible to send rockets into outer space.
Because this has been done, the work required must be finite. You can determine the
work in the following manner. Using the integral in Example 3, Section 7.5, replace the
upper bound of 4800 miles by 
and write
mile-tons
foot-pounds.
In SI units, using a conversion factor of
1 foot-pound 
1.35582 joules
the work done is

An Improper Integral with an Infinite Discontinuity
Evaluate 
Solution
The integrand has an infinite 
discontinuity at 
as shown in Figure 8.23.
You can evaluate this integral as shown below.
An Improper Integral That Diverges
Evaluate 
Solution
Because the integrand has an infinite discontinuity at 
you can write
So, you can conclude that the improper integral diverges.
An Improper Integral with an Interior Discontinuity
Evaluate 
Solution
This integral is improper because the integrand has an infinite discontinuity at
the interior point 
as shown in Figure 8.24. So, you can write
From Example 7, you know that the second integral diverges. So, the original improper
integral also diverges.
Remember to check for infinite discontinuities at interior points as well as at 
endpoints when determining whether an integral is improper. For instance, if you had
not recognized that the integral in Example 8 was improper, you would have obtained
the incorrect result

) and write
See Figure 8.25.
An Application Involving Arc Length
Use the formula for arc length to show that the circumference of the circle 
is 
Solution
To simplify the work, consider the quarter circle given by 
where 
The function 
is differentiable for any 
in this interval except
Therefore, the arc length of the quarter circle is given by the improper integral
This integral is improper because it has an infinite discontinuity at 
So, you can
write
Finally, multiplying by 4, you can conclude that the circumference of the circle is
as shown in Figure 8.26.

This section concludes with a useful theorem describing the convergence or 
divergence of a common type of improper integral. The proof of this theorem is left as
an exercise (see Exercise 49).
An Application Involving a Solid of Revolution
The solid formed by revolving (about the axis) the unbounded region lying between
the graph of 
and the 
axis 
is called Gabriel’s Horn. (See 
Figure 8.27.) Show that this solid has a finite volume and an infinite surface area.
Solution
Using the disk method and Theorem 8.5, you can determine the volume 
to be
Theorem 8.5,
The surface area is given by
Because
on the interval 
and the improper integral
diverges, you can conclude that the improper integral
also diverges. (See Exercise 52.) So, the surface area is infinite.
Gabriel’s Horn has a finite volume and an infinite surface area.

Sequences
In mathematics, the word “sequence” is used in much the same way as it is in ordinary
English. Saying that a collection of objects or events is in sequence usually means that
the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an identified first member, second
member, third member, and so on.
Mathematically, a sequence is defined as a function whose domain is the set of
positive integers. Although a sequence is a function, it is common to represent
sequences by subscript notation rather than by the standard function notation. For
instance, in the sequence
1,
2,
3,
4,
Sequence
1 is mapped onto 
2 is mapped onto 
and so on. The numbers
are the terms of the sequence. The number 
is the th term of the sequence, and the
entire sequence is denoted by 
Occasionally, it is convenient to begin a sequence
with 
so that the terms of the sequence become 
and the
domain is the set of nonnegative integers.

REMARK
Some sequences
are defined recursively. To
define a sequence recursively,
you need to be given one or
more of the first few terms. All
other terms of the sequence are
then defined using previous
terms, as shown in Example 1(d).

Limit of a Sequence
The primary focus of this chapter concerns sequences whose terms approach limiting
values. Such sequences are said to converge. For instance, the sequence 
converges to 0, as indicated in the next definition.
Graphically, this definition says that eventually (for 
and 
), the terms
of a sequence that converges to 
will lie within the band between the lines 
and 
as shown in Figure 9.1.
If a sequence 
agrees with a function at every positive integer, and if 
approaches a limit 
as 
then the sequence must converge to the same limit 
Finding the Limit of a Sequence
Find the limit of the sequence whose 
term is 
Solution
In Theorem 5.15, you learned that
So, you can apply Theorem 9.1 to conclude that
There are different ways in which a sequence can fail to have a limit. One way is
that the terms of the sequence increase without bound or decrease without bound. These
cases are written symbolically, as shown below.
Terms increase without bound:

TECHNOLOGY Use a
graphing utility to graph the
function in Example 4. Notice
that as approaches infinity,
the value of the function gets
closer and closer to 0. If you

that can generate terms of 
a sequence, try using it to

the sequence in Example 4.
Then view the terms to observe
numerically that the sequence

The symbol

factorial”) is used to simplify some of the formulas
developed in this chapter. Let be a positive integer; then 
factorial is defined as

Another useful limit theorem that can be rewritten for sequences is the Squeeze

In Example 5, the sequence 
has both positive and negative terms. For this
sequence, it happens that the sequence of absolute values,
also converges to 0.
You can show this by the Squeeze Theorem using the inequality
In such cases, it is often convenient to consider the sequence of absolute values—and
then apply Theorem 9.4, which states that if the absolute value sequence converges to
0, then the original signed sequence also converges to 0.
Proof
Consider the two sequences 
and 
Because both of these
sequences converge to 0 and
you can use the Squeeze Theorem to conclude that 
converges to 0.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Pattern Recognition for Sequences
Sometimes the terms of a sequence are generated by some rule that does not
explicitly identify the 
term of the sequence. In such cases, you may be required to
discover a pattern in the sequence and to describe the 
term. Once the 
term has
been specified, you can investigate the convergence or divergence of the sequence.
Finding the nth Term of a Sequence
Find a sequence 
whose first five terms are
and then determine whether the sequence you have chosen converges or diverges.
Solution
First, note that the numerators are successive powers of 2, and the 
denominators form the sequence of positive odd integers. By comparing 
with 
you
have the following pattern.
Consider the function of a real variable 
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule
produces
Next, apply Theorem 9.1 to conclude that
So, the sequence diverges.

Without a specific rule for generating the terms of a sequence or some knowledge
of the context in which the terms of the sequence are obtained, it is not possible to 
determine the convergence or divergence of the sequence merely from its first several
terms. For instance, although the first three terms of the following four sequences are
identical, the first two sequences converge to 0, the third sequence converges to 
and
the fourth sequence diverges.
The process of determining an 
term from the pattern observed in the first several
terms of a sequence is an example of inductive reasoning.
Finding the nth Term of a Sequence
Determine the 
term for a sequence whose first five terms are
and then decide whether the sequence converges or diverges.
Solution
Note that the numerators are 1 less than 
So, you can reason that the numerators are given by the rule
Factoring the denominators produces
and
This suggests that the denominators are represented by 
Finally, because the signs
alternate, you can write the 
term as
From the discussion about the growth of 
it follows that
Applying Theorem 9.4, you can conclude that
So, the sequence 
converges to 0.

Monotonic Sequences and Bounded Sequences
So far, you have determined the convergence of a sequence by finding its limit. Even
when you cannot determine the limit of a particular sequence, it still may be useful to
know whether the sequence converges. Theorem 9.5 (on the next page) provides a test
for convergence of sequences without determining the limit. First, some preliminary 
definitions are given.
Determining Whether a Sequence Is Monotonic
Determine whether each sequence having the given 
term is monotonic.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. This sequence alternates between 2 and 4. So, it is not monotonic.
b. This sequence is monotonic because each successive term is greater than its 
predecessor. To see this, compare the terms 
and 
[Note that, because 
is
positive, you can multiply each side of the inequality by 
and 
without reversing the inequality sign.]
Starting with the final inequality, which is valid, you can reverse the steps to
conclude that the original inequality is also valid.
c. This sequence is not monotonic, because the second term is greater than the first term,
and greater than the third. (Note that when you drop the first term, the remaining
sequence 
is monotonic.)
Figure 9.3 graphically illustrates these three sequences.
In Example 8(b), another way to see that the sequence is monotonic is to argue that
the derivative of the corresponding differentiable function
is positive for all 
This implies that is increasing, which in turn implies that 
is
increasing.

Note that all three sequences in Example 3 (and shown in Figure 9.3) are bounded.
To see this, note that
and
One important property of the real numbers is that they are complete.
Informally, this means that there are no holes or gaps on the real number line. (The set
of rational numbers does not have the completeness property.) The completeness axiom
for real numbers can be used to conclude that if a sequence has an upper bound, then 
it must have a least upper bound (an upper bound that is less than all other 
upper bounds for the sequence). For example, the least upper bound of the sequence
is 1. The completeness axiom is used in the proof of Theorem 9.5.
Proof
Assume that the sequence is nondecreasing, as shown in Figure 9.4. For the
sake of simplicity, also assume that each term in the sequence is positive. Because the
sequence is bounded, there must exist an upper bound 
such that
From the completeness axiom, it follows that there is a least upper bound 
such that
For 
it follows that 
and therefore 
cannot be an upper bound
for the sequence. Consequently, at least one term of 
is greater than 
That is,
for some positive integer 
Because the terms of 
are nondecreasing,
it follows that 
for 
You now know that 
for every 
It follows that

which by definition means that

The proof for a nonincreasing sequence is similar (see Exercise 91).
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Bounded and Monotonic Sequences
a. The sequence 
is both bounded and monotonic, and so, by Theorem 9.5,
it must converge.
b. The divergent sequence 
is monotonic, but not bounded. (It is
bounded below.)
c. The divergent sequence 
is bounded, but not monotonic.

Definition of Bounded Sequence
1. A sequence 
is bounded above when there is a real number 
such that
for all 
The number 
is called an upper bound of the sequence.
2. A sequence 
is bounded below when there is a real number 
such that
for all 
The number 
is called a lower bound of the sequence.
3. A sequence 
is bounded when it is bounded above and bounded below.

Series and Convergence
Understand the definition of a convergent infinite series.
Use properties of infinite geometric series.
Use the th-Term Test for Divergence of an infinite series.
Infinite Series
One important application of infinite sequences is in representing “infinite
summations.” Informally, if 
is an infinite sequence, then
Infinite Series
is an infinite series (or simply a series). The numbers 
and so on are the terms
of the series. For some series, it is convenient to begin the index at 
(or some other
integer). As a typesetting convention, it is common to represent an infinite series as
In such cases, the starting value for the index must be taken from the context of
the statement.
To find the sum of an infinite series, consider the sequence of partial sums listed
below.
If this sequence of partial sums converges, then the series is said to converge and has
the sum indicated in the next definition.
As you study this chapter, you will see that there are two basic questions involving
infinite series.
• Does a series converge or does it diverge?
• When a series converges, what is its sum?
These questions are not always easy to answer, especially the second one.

INFINITE SERIES
The study of infinite series was
considered a novelty in the 
fourteenth century. Logician
Richard Suiseth, whose nickname
was Calculator, solved this 
problem.
If throughout the first half of 
a given time interval a variation 
continues at a certain intensity,
throughout the next quarter of 
the interval at double the intensity,
throughout the following eighth 
at triple the intensity and so ad 
infinitum; then the average intensity for
the whole interval will be the intensity
of the variation during the second
subinterval (or double the intensity).
This is the same as saying that the
sum of the infinite series
is 2.

series geometrically, as shown in Figure 9.6.)
Because
it follows that the series converges and its sum is 1.
b. The 
partial sum of the series
is
Because the limit of 
is 1, the series converges and its sum is 1.
c. The series

and the sequence of partial sums diverges.
The series in Example 1(b) is a telescoping series of the form
Telescoping series
Note that 
is canceled by the second term,

Convergent and Divergent Geometric Series
a. The geometric series
has a ratio of 
with 
Because 
the series converges and its
sum is 
b. The geometric series
has a ratio of 
Because 
the series diverges.
The formula for the sum of a geometric series can be used to write a repeating 
decimal as the ratio of two integers, as demonstrated in the next example.
A Geometric Series for a Repeating Decimal
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Use a geometric series to write 
as the ratio of two integers.
Solution
For the repeating decimal 
you can write
For this series, you have 
and 
So,
Try dividing 8 by 99 on a calculator to see that it produces 
The convergence of a series is not affected by the removal of a finite number of
terms from the beginning of the series. For instance, the geometric series
and
both converge. Furthermore, because the sum of the second series is 
you can conclude that the sum of the first series is

The properties in the next theorem are direct consequences of the corresponding
properties of limits of sequences.
th-Term Test for Divergence
The next theorem states that when a series converges, the limit of its 
term must be 0.
Proof
Assume that
Then, because 
and
it follows that
which implies that 
converges to 0.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The contrapositive of Theorem 9.8 provides a useful test for divergence. This
nth-Term Test for Divergence states that if the limit of the 
term of a series does
not converge to 0, then the series must diverge.

Bouncing Ball Problem
A ball is dropped from a height of 6 feet and begins bouncing, as shown in Figure 9.7.
The height of each bounce is three-fourths the height of the previous bounce. Find the
total vertical distance traveled by the ball.
Solution
When the ball hits the ground for the first time, it has traveled a distance
of 
feet. For subsequent bounces, let 
be the distance traveled up and down.
For example,
and 
are
Up
Down
and
Up
Down
By continuing this process, it can be determined that the total vertical distance is
  42 feet.

9.3
The Integral Test and p-Series
Use the Integral Test to determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges.
Use properties of -series and harmonic series.
The Integral Test
In this and the next section, you will study several convergence tests that apply to series
with positive terms.
Proof
Begin by partitioning the interval 
into 
unit intervals, as shown
in Figure 9.8. The total areas of the inscribed rectangles and the circumscribed
rectangles are
Inscribed area
and
Circumscribed area
The exact area under the graph of from 
to 
lies between the inscribed and
circumscribed areas.
Using the 
partial sum,
you can write this
inequality as
Now, assuming that 
converges to 
it follows that for 
Consequently,
is bounded and monotonic, and by Theorem 9.5 it converges. So,
converges. For the other direction of the proof, assume that the improper integral
diverges. Then 
approaches infinity as 
and the inequality
implies that 
diverges. So,
diverges.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Remember that the convergence or divergence of 
is not affected by deleting
the first 
terms. Similarly, when the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied for all
you can simply use the integral 
to test for convergence or 
divergence. (This is illustrated in Example 4.)

and it follows that satisfies the conditions for the Integral Test.
You can integrate to obtain
So, the series diverges.

Apply the Integral Test to the series 
Solution
Because

So, the series converges (see Figure 9.9).
In Example 2, the fact that the improper integral converges to

-Series and Harmonic Series
In the remainder of this section, you will investigate a second type of series that has a
simple arithmetic test for convergence or divergence. A series of the form
-series
is a p-series, where is a positive constant. For 
the series
Harmonic series
is the harmonic series. A general harmonic series is of the form 
In
music, strings of the same material, diameter, and tension, and whose lengths form a
harmonic series, produce harmonic tones.
The Integral Test is convenient for establishing the convergence or divergence of
series. This is shown in the proof of Theorem 9.11.
Proof
The proof follows from the Integral Test and from Theorem 8.5, which states
that
converges for 
and diverges for 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.

Discuss the convergence or divergence of (a) the harmonic series and (b) the 
series
with 
Solution
a. From Theorem 9.11, it follows that the harmonic series
diverges.
b. From Theorem 9.11, it follows that the

HARMONIC SERIES
Pythagoras and his students 
paid close attention to the 
development of music as an
abstract science.This led to the
discovery of the relationship
between the tone and the length
of a vibrating string. It was
observed that the most beautiful
musical harmonies corresponded
to the simplest ratios of whole
numbers. Later mathematicians
developed this idea into the 
harmonic series, where the terms
in the harmonic series correspond
to the nodes on a vibrating string
that produce multiples of the 
fundamental frequency. For example,
is twice the fundamental
frequency,
is three times the 
fundamental frequency, and so on.

The sum of the series in Example 3(b) can be shown to be 
(This was proved
by Leonhard Euler, but the proof is too difficult to present here.) Be sure you see that
the Integral Test does not tell you that the sum of the series is equal to the value of the
integral. For instance, the sum of the series in Example 3(b) is 
whereas the value of the corresponding improper integral is
Testing a Series for Convergence
Determine whether the series
converges or diverges.
Solution
This series is similar to the divergent harmonic series. If its terms were 
greater than those of the harmonic series, you would expect it to diverge. However,
because its terms are less than those of the harmonic series, you are not sure what to
expect. The function
is positive and continuous for 
To determine whether is decreasing, first rewrite
as
and then find its derivative.
So,
for 
and it follows that satisfies the conditions for the Integral Test.
The series diverges.
Note that the infinite series in Example 4 diverges very slowly. For instance, as
shown in the table, the sum of the first 10 terms is approximately 1.6878196, whereas
the sum of the first 100 terms is just slightly greater: 2.3250871. In fact, the sum of the
first 10,000 terms is approximately 3.0150217. You can see that although the infinite
series “adds up to infinity,” it does so very slowly.

The harmonic series
is one of the most important series in this chapter. Even though its
terms tend to zero as increases,
the harmonic series diverges. In other words, even though the terms
are getting smaller and smaller, the sum “adds up to infinity.”
(a) One way to show that the harmonic series diverges is attributed
to James Bernoulli. He grouped the terms of the harmonic
series as follows:
Write a short paragraph explaining how you can use this
grouping to show that the harmonic series diverges.

Comparisons of Series
Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine whether a series converges or
diverges.
Use the Limit Comparison Test to determine whether a series converges or
diverges.
Direct Comparison Test
For the convergence tests developed so far, the terms of the series have to be fairly
simple and the series must have special characteristics in order for the convergence tests
to be applied. A slight deviation from these special characteristics can make a test 
nonapplicable. For example, in the pairs listed below, the second series cannot be tested
by the same convergence test as the first series, even though it is similar to the first.

is geometric, but 
is not.
2.

series, but

3.
is easily integrated, but 
is not.
In this section, you will study two additional tests for positive-term series. These two
tests greatly expand the variety of series you are able to test for convergence or
divergence. They allow you to compare a series having complicated terms with a
simpler series whose convergence or divergence is known.
Proof
To prove the first property, let 
and let
Because 
the sequence 
is nondecreasing and bounded
above by 
so, it must converge. Because
it follows that 
converges. The second property is logically equivalent to the first.

term comparison reveals a series that is less than a divergent series, the Direct
Comparison Test tells you nothing.) Still expecting the series to diverge, you can
compare the series with
Divergent harmonic series
In this case, term-by-term comparison yields
and, by the Direct Comparison Test, the given series diverges. To verify the last 
inequality, try showing that
whenever 
Remember that both parts of the Direct Comparison Test require that 
Informally, the test says the following about the two series with nonnegative terms.
1. If the “larger” series converges, then the “smaller” series must also converge.
2. If the “smaller” series diverges, then the “larger” series must also diverge.

Limit Comparison Test
Sometimes a series closely resembles a 
series or a geometric series, yet you cannot
establish the term-by-term comparison necessary to apply the Direct Comparison Test.
Under these circumstances, you may be able to apply a second comparison test, called
the Limit Comparison Test.
Proof
Because 
and 
there exists 
such that
for 
This implies that
So, by the Direct Comparison Test, the convergence of 
implies the convergence of
Similarly, the fact that
can be used to show that the convergence of 
implies the convergence of 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Using the Limit Comparison Test
Show that the general harmonic series below diverges.
Solution
By comparison with
Divergent harmonic series
you have
Because this limit is greater than 0, you can conclude from the Limit Comparison Test
that the series diverges.

The Limit Comparison Test works well for comparing a “messy” algebraic series
with a 
series. In choosing an appropriate 
series, you must choose one with an 
term of the same magnitude as the 
term of the given series.
Given Series
Comparison Series
Conclusion
Both series converge.
Both series diverge.
Both series converge.
In other words, when choosing a series for comparison, you can disregard all but the
highest powers of 
in both the numerator and the denominator.

Most wines are produced entirely from grapes grown in a single
year. Sherry, however, is a complex mixture of older wines with
new wines. This is done with a sequence of barrels (called a solera)
stacked on top of each other, as shown in the photo.
The oldest wine is in the bottom tier of barrels, and the newest is
in the top tier. Each year, half of each barrel in the bottom tier is
bottled as sherry. The bottom barrels are then refilled with the wine
from the barrels above. This process is repeated throughout the 
solera, with new wine being added to the top barrels.
A mathematical model for the amount of 
year-old wine that is
removed from a solera (with tiers) each year is
(a) Consider a solera that has five tiers, numbered 
2, 3, 4,
and 5. In 1995 
, half of each barrel in the top tier (tier 1)
was refilled with new wine. How much of this wine was
removed from the solera in 1996? In 1997? In 1998? .  .  . In
2010? During which year(s) was the greatest amount of the
1995 wine removed from the solera?
(b) In part (a), let 
be the amount of 1995 wine that is removed
from the solera in year

Alternating Series
Use the Alternating Series Test to determine whether an infinite series converges.
Use the Alternating Series Remainder to approximate the sum of an alternating
series.
Classify a convergent series as absolutely or conditionally convergent.
Rearrange an infinite series to obtain a different sum.
Alternating Series
So far, most series you have dealt with have had positive terms. In this section and the
next section, you will study series that contain both positive and negative terms. The
simplest such series is an alternating series, whose terms alternate in sign. For example,
the geometric series
is an alternating geometric series with 
Alternating series occur in two ways:
either the odd terms are negative or the even terms are negative.
Proof
Consider the alternating series 
For this series, the partial sum
(where 
is even)
has all nonnegative terms, and therefore 
is a nondecreasing sequence. But you can
also write
which implies that 
for every integer 
So,
is a bounded, nondecreasing
sequence that converges to some value 
Because 
and 
you have
Because both 
and 
converge to the same limit 
it follows that 
also
converges to 
Consequently, the given alternating series converges.

the sum 
of the series. The error involved in using

Approximating the Sum of an Alternating Series
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Approximate the sum of the series by its first six terms.
Solution
The series converges by the Alternating Series Test because
and
The sum of the first six terms is

So, the sum 
lies between

Finding the Number of Terms
Determine the number of terms required to approximate the sum of the series with an
error of less than 0.001.
Solution
By Theorem 9.15, you know that 
For an error of less than 0.001,
must satisfy the inequality 
So, you will need at least 5 terms. Using 5 terms, the sum is 
which
has an error of less than 0.001.

Absolute and Conditional Convergence
Occasionally, a series may have both positive and negative terms and not be an
alternating series. For instance, the series
has both positive and negative terms, yet it is not an alternating series. One way to
obtain some information about the convergence of this series is to investigate the
convergence of the series
By direct comparison, you have 
for all 
so
Therefore, by the Direct Comparison Test, the series 
converges. The next 
theorem tells you that the original series also converges.
Proof
Because 
for all 
the series
converges by comparison with the convergent series
Furthermore, because 
you can write
where both series on the right converge. So, it follows that 
converges.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The converse of Theorem 9.16 is not true. For instance, the alternating harmonic
series
converges by the Alternating Series Test. Yet the harmonic series diverges. This type of
convergence is called conditional.

b.
Solution
a. This is an alternating series, but the Alternating Series Test does not apply because
the limit of the th term is not zero. By the 
Term Test for Divergence, however,
you can conclude that this series diverges.
b. This series can be shown to be convergent by the Alternating Series Test. Moreover,
because the

Consequently, by Theorem 9.16, you can conclude that the given series is absolutely

b. In this case, the Alternating Series Test indicates that the series converges. However,
the series

Rearrangement of Series
A finite sum such as
can be rearranged without changing the value of the sum. This is not necessarily true of
an infinite series––it depends on whether the series is absolutely convergent or 
conditionally convergent.
1. If a series is absolutely convergent, then its terms can be rearranged in any order
without changing the sum of the series.
2. If a series is conditionally convergent, then its terms can be rearranged to give a 
different sum.
The second case is illustrated in Example 8.
Rearrangement of a Series
The alternating harmonic series converges to 
That is,
(See Exercise 55, Section 9.10.) 
Rearrange the series to produce a different sum.
Solution
Consider the rearrangement below.
By rearranging the terms, you obtain a sum that is half the original sum.

The Ratio and Root Tests

Use the Root Test to determine whether a series converges or diverges.
Review the tests for convergence and divergence of an infinite series.
The Ratio Test
This section begins with a test for absolute convergence—the Ratio Test.
Proof
To prove Property 1, assume that
and choose 
such that 
By the definition of the limit of a sequence,
there exists some 
such that 
for all 
Therefore, you can
write the following inequalities.
The geometric series 
converges,
and so, by the Direct Comparison Test, the series
also converges. This in turn implies that the series 
converges, because discarding
a finite number of terms 
does not affect convergence. Consequently, by
Theorem 9.16, the series 
converges absolutely. The proof of Property 2 is similar
and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 99).
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The fact that the Ratio Test is inconclusive when 
can be seen by 
comparing the two series 
and 
The first series diverges and the second
one converges, but in both cases

A Failure of the Ratio Test
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Determine the convergence or divergence of
Solution
The limit of 
is equal to 1.
So, the Ratio Test is inconclusive. To determine whether the series converges, you need
to try a different test. In this case, you can apply the Alternating Series Test. To show
that 
let
Then the derivative is
Because the derivative is negative for 
you know that is a decreasing function.
Also, by L’Hôpital’s Rule,
Therefore, by the Alternating Series Test, the series converges.
The series in Example 3 is conditionally convergent. This follows from the fact that
the series
diverges by the Limit Comparison Test with 
but the series
converges.

The Root Test
The next test for convergence or divergence of series works especially well for series
involving 
powers. The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof given for the
Ratio Test, and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 100).
Using the Root Test
Determine the convergence or divergence of
Solution
You can apply the Root Test as follows.
Because this limit is less than 1, you can conclude that the series converges absolutely
(and therefore converges).
To see the usefulness of the Root Test for the series in Example 4, try applying the
Ratio Test to that series. When you do this, you obtain the following.
Note that this limit is not as easily evaluated as the limit obtained by the Root Test in
Example 4.

Strategies for Testing Series
You have now studied 10 tests for determining the convergence or divergence of an 
infinite series. (See the summary in the table on the next page.) Skill in choosing and
applying the various tests will come only with practice. Below is a set of guidelines for
choosing an appropriate test.
In some instances, more than one test is applicable. However, your objective should be
to learn to choose the most efficient test.
Applying the Strategies for Testing Series
Determine the convergence or divergence of each series.
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
Solution
a. For this series, the limit of the 
term is not 0 
as 
So, by the 
Term Test, the series diverges.
b. This series is geometric. Moreover, because the ratio of the terms
is less than 1 in absolute value, you can conclude that the series converges.
c. Because the function
is easily integrated, you can use the Integral Test to conclude that the series converges.
d. The 
term of this series can be compared to the th term of the harmonic series.
After using the Limit Comparison Test, you can conclude that the series diverges.
e. This is an alternating series whose 
term approaches 0. Because 
you
can use the Alternating Series Test to conclude that the series converges.
f. The 
term of this series involves a factorial, which indicates that the Ratio Test
may work well. After applying the Ratio Test, you can conclude that the series
diverges.
g. The 
term of this series involves a variable that is raised to the 
power, which
indicates that the Root Test may work well. After applying the Root Test, you can
conclude that the series converges.

GUIDELINES FOR TESTING A SERIES FOR CONVERGENCE OR
DIVERGENCE
1. Does the 
term approach 0? If not, the series diverges.
2. Is the series one of the special types—geometric,
series, telescoping, or
alternating?
3. Can the Integral Test, the Root Test, or the Ratio Test be applied?
4. Can the series be compared favorably to one of the special types?

the elementary functions.
Find Taylor and Maclaurin polynomial approximations of elementary functions.
Use the remainder of a Taylor polynomial.
Polynomial Approximations of Elementary Functions
The goal of this section is to show how polynomial functions can be used as
approximations for other elementary functions. To find a polynomial function 
that
approximates another function 
begin by choosing a number 
in the domain of at
which and 
have the same value. That is,
Graphs of and 
pass through 
The approximating polynomial is said to be expanded about
or centered at 
Geometrically, the requirement that 
means that the graph of 
passes
through the point 
Of course, there are many polynomials whose graphs pass
through the point 
Your task is to find a polynomial whose graph resembles the
graph of near this point. One way to do this is to impose the additional requirement
that the slope of the polynomial function be the same as the slope of the graph of at
the point 
Graphs of and 
have the same slope at 
With these two requirements, you can obtain a simple linear approximation of 
as
shown in Figure 9.10.
First-Degree Polynomial Approximation of 
For the function 
find a first-degree polynomial function 
whose value and slope agree with the value and slope of at 
Solution
Because 
and 
the value and the slope of at 
are 
Value of at

you can use the condition that 
to conclude that
Moreover, because 
you can use the condition that

Example 1 is not
the first time you have used a
linear function to approximate
another function. The same 
procedure was used as the basis
for Newton’s Method.

In Figure 9.12, you can see that, at points near 
the graph of the first-degree
polynomial function
1st-degree approximation
is reasonably close to the graph of 
As you move away from 
however,
the graphs move farther and farther from each other and the accuracy of the 
approximation decreases. To improve the approximation, you can impose yet another
requirement—that the values of the second derivatives of 
and agree when 
The polynomial,
of least degree that satisfies all three requirements 
and 
can be shown to be
2nd-degree approximation
Moreover, in Figure 9.12, you can see that 
is a better approximation of than 
By
requiring that the values of 
and its first 
derivatives match those of

Third-Degree Polynomial Approximation of 
Construct a table comparing the values of the polynomial

with 
for several values of near 0.
Solution
Using a calculator or a computer, you can obtain the results shown in the
table. Note that for 
the two functions have the same value, but that as moves
farther away from 0, the accuracy of the approximating polynomial 
decreases.

Taylor polynomials and Maclaurin polynomials can be used to approximate the
value of a function at a specific point. For instance, to approximate the value of 
you can use Taylor polynomials for 
expanded about 
as shown in
Example 4, or you can use Maclaurin polynomials, as shown in Example 7.
Approximation Using Maclaurin Polynomials
Use a fourth Maclaurin polynomial to approximate the value of 
Solution
Because 1.1 is closer to 1 than to 0, you should consider Maclaurin
polynomials for the function 
Note that you obtain the same coefficients as in Example 4. Therefore, the fourth
Maclaurin polynomial for

Fourth Maclaurin Polynomial Approximation of 
These two tables illustrate two very important points about the accuracy of Taylor
(or Maclaurin) polynomials for use in approximations.
1. The approximation is usually better for higher-degree Taylor (or Maclaurin)
polynomials than for those of lower degree.
2. The approximation is usually better at values close to than at values far from c.

Remainder of a Taylor Polynomial
An approximation technique is of little value without some idea of its accuracy. To
measure the accuracy of approximating a function value 
by the Taylor polynomial
you can use the concept of a remainder
defined as follows.
So,
The absolute value of 
is called the error associated
with the approximation. That is,
The next theorem gives a general procedure for estimating the remainder
associated with a Taylor polynomial. This important theorem is called Taylor’s
Theorem, and the remainder given in the theorem is called the Lagrange form of the
remainder.
One useful consequence of Taylor’s Theorem is that
max 
where 
is the maximum value of 
between and 
For 
Taylor’s Theorem states that if 
is differentiable in an interval 
containing 
then, for each in 
there exists between and such that
or
Do you recognize this special case of Taylor’s Theorem? (It is the Mean Value
Theorem.)
When applying Taylor’s Theorem, you should not expect to be able to find the
exact value of 
(If you could do this, an approximation would not be necessary.)
Rather, you are trying to find bounds for 
from which you are able to tell how
large the remainder 
is.

Power Series
In Section 9.7, you were introduced to the concept of approximating functions by
Taylor polynomials. For instance, the function 
can be approximated by its
third-degree Maclaurin polynomial
In that section, you saw that the higher the degree of the approximating polynomial, the
better the approximation becomes.
In this and the next two sections, you will see that several important types of
functions, including 
can be represented exactly by an infinite series called a
power series. For example, the power series representation for 
is
For each real number 
it can be shown that the infinite series on the right converges to
the number 
Before doing this, however, some preliminary results dealing with power
series will be discussed—beginning with the next definition.

Radius and Interval of Convergence
A power series in can be viewed as a function of 
where the domain of
is the set of all 
for which the power series converges.
Determination of the domain of a power series is the primary concern in this section.
Of course, every power series converges at its center because
So,
always lies in the domain of 
Theorem 9.20 (see below) states that the domain
of a power series can take three basic forms: a single point, an interval centered at 
or
the entire real number line, as shown in Figure 9.17.
The domain of a power series has only three 
basic forms: a single point, an interval centered

THEOREM 9.20
Convergence of a Power Series
For a power series centered at 
precisely one of the following is true.
1. The series converges only at 
2. There exists a real number 
such that the series converges absolutely 
for
and diverges for
3. The series converges absolutely for all 
The number 
is the radius of convergence of the power series. If the series 
converges only at 
then the radius of convergence is 
If the series
converges for all 
then the radius of convergence is 
The set of all 
values of for which the power series converges is the interval of convergence
of the power series.
A proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.

Endpoint Convergence
Note that for a power series whose radius of convergence is a finite number 
Theorem 9.20
says nothing about the convergence at the endpoints of the interval of convergence.
Each endpoint must be tested separately for convergence or divergence. As a result, the
interval of convergence of a power series can take any one of the six forms shown in
Figure 9.18.
Intervals of convergence

Finding the Interval of Convergence
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the interval of convergence of
Solution
Letting 
produces
So, by the Ratio Test, the radius of convergence is 
Moreover, because the series
is centered at 0,
it converges in the interval 
This interval,
however, is not necessarily the interval of convergence. To determine this, you must test
for convergence at each endpoint. When 
you obtain the divergent harmonic
series
Diverges when
When 
you obtain the convergent alternating harmonic series
Converges when
So, the interval of convergence for the series is 
as shown in Figure 9.19.

Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
Power series representation of functions has played an important role in the 
development of calculus. In fact, much of Newton’s work with differentiation and 
integration was done in the context of power series—especially his work with 
complicated algebraic functions and transcendental functions. Euler, Lagrange,
Leibniz, and the Bernoullis all used power series extensively in calculus.
Once you have defined a function with a power series, it is natural to wonder how
you can determine the characteristics of the function. Is it continuous? Differentiable?
Theorem 9.21, which is stated without proof, answers these questions.
Theorem 9.21 states that, in many ways, a function defined by a power series
behaves like a polynomial. It is continuous in its interval of convergence, and both its
derivative and its antiderivative can be determined by differentiating and integrating
each term of the power series. For instance, the derivative of the power series 
is
Notice that

The radius of convergence of the series obtained by differentiating or integrating 
a power series is the same as that of the original power series. The interval of 
convergence, however, may differ as a result of the behavior at the endpoints.

JAMES GREGORY (1638–1675)
One of the earliest mathematicians
to work with power series was a
Scotsman, James Gregory. He
developed a power series method
for interpolating table values––a
method that was later used by
Brook Taylor in the development
of Taylor polynomials and Taylor
series.

From Example 8, it appears that of the three series, the one for the derivative,
is the least likely to converge at the endpoints. In fact, it can be shown that if the series
for 
converges at the endpoints 
then the series for 
will also converge there.

JOSEPH FOURIER (1768–1830)
Some of the early work in 
representing functions by power
series was done by the French
mathematician Joseph Fourier.
Fourier’s work is important in the
history of calculus, partly because
it forced eighteenth-century 
mathematicians to question the
then-prevailing narrow concept 
of a function. Both Cauchy and
Dirichlet were motivated by
Fourier’s work with series, and 
in 1837 Dirichlet published the 
general definition of a function
that is used today.

Operations with Power Series
The versatility of geometric power series will be shown later in this section, following
a discussion of power series operations. These operations, used with differentiation and
integration, provide a means of developing power series for a variety of elementary
functions. (For simplicity, the operations are stated for a series centered at 0.)
The operations described above can change the interval of convergence for the
resulting series. For example, in the addition shown below, the interval of convergence
for the sum is the intersection of the intervals of convergence of the two original series.
Adding Two Power Series
Find a power series for
centered at 0.
Solution
Using partial fractions, you can write 
as
By adding the two geometric power series
and
you obtain the power series shown below.
The interval of convergence for this power series is 1, 1.

Finding a Power Series by Integration

Solution
From Example 2, you know that
Interval of convergence:
Integrating this series produces
By letting 
you can conclude that 
Therefore,
Note that the series converges at 
This is consistent with the observation in the
preceding section that integration of a power series may alter the convergence at the
endpoints of the interval of convergence.
In Section 9.7, Example 4, the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for the natural 
logarithmic function
was used to approximate 
You now know from Example 4 in this section that this polynomial represents the first
four terms of the power series for 
Moreover, using the Alternating Series
Remainder, you can determine that the error in this approximation is less than
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mathematical tables for logarithms
and values of other transcendental functions were computed in this manner. Such
numerical techniques are far from outdated, because it is precisely by such means that
many modern calculating devices are programmed to evaluate transcendental functions.

Find a power series for
centered at 0.
Solution
Because 
you can use the series
Interval of convergence:
Substituting 
for produces
Finally, by integrating, you obtain
Let 
then 
Interval of convergence:
It can be shown that the power series developed for 
in Example 5 also 
converges (to 
) for 
For instance, when 
you can write
However, this series (developed by James Gregory in 1671) does not give us a 
practical way of approximating 
because it converges so slowly that hundreds of terms
would have to be used to obtain reasonable accuracy. Example 6 shows how to use two
different arctangent series to obtain a very good approximation of 
using only a few
terms. This approximation was developed by John Machin in 1706.
Approximating 
with a Series
Use the trigonometric identity
to approximate the number 
[see Exercise 46(b)].
Solution
By using only five terms from each of the series for 
and
you obtain
which agrees with the exact value of 
with an error of less than 0.0000001.

Taylor Series and Maclaurin Series
In Section 9.9, you derived power series for several functions using geometric series
with term-by-term differentiation or integration. In this section, you will study a 
general procedure for deriving the power series for a function that has derivatives of all
orders. The next theorem gives the form that every convergent power series must take.
Proof
Consider a power series 
that has a radius of convergence 
Then,
by Theorem 9.21, you know that the 
derivative of exists for 
and by
successive differentiation you obtain the following.
Evaluating each of these derivatives at 
yields
and, in general,
By solving for 
you find that the coefficients of the
power series representation of 
are
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Notice that the coefficients of the power series in Theorem 9.22 are precisely the
coefficients of the Taylor polynomials for 
at 
as defined in Section 9.7. For this
reason, the series is called the Taylor series for

COLIN MACLAURIN (1698–1746)
The development of power series
to represent functions is credited
to the combined work of many
seventeenth- and eighteenth-
century mathematicians. Gregory,
Newton, John and James Bernoulli,
Leibniz, Euler, Lagrange,Wallis, and
Fourier all contributed to this
work. However, the two names
that are most commonly associated
with power series are Brook
Taylor (1685–1731) and Colin
Maclaurin.

When you know the pattern for the coefficients of the Taylor polynomials for a
function, you can extend the pattern easily to form the corresponding Taylor series. For
instance, in Example 4 in Section 9.7, you found the fourth Taylor polynomial for 
centered at 1, to be
From this pattern, you can obtain the Taylor series for 
centered at 
Forming a Power Series
Use the function
to form the Maclaurin series
and determine the interval of convergence.
Solution
Successive differentiation of 
yields
and so on. The pattern repeats after the third derivative. So, the power series is as
follows.
By the Ratio Test, you can conclude that this series converges for all x.

Notice that in Example 1, you cannot conclude that the power series converges to
for all 
You can simply conclude that the power series converges to some
function, but you are not sure what function it is. This is a subtle, but important, point
in dealing with Taylor or Maclaurin series. To persuade yourself that the series
might converge to a function other than 
remember that the derivatives are being 
evaluated at a single point. It can easily happen that another function will agree with the
values of 
when 
and disagree at other 
values. For instance, the power
series (centered at 0) for the function shown in Figure 9.23 is the same series as in
Example 1. You know that the series converges for all 
and yet it obviously cannot
converge to both 
and 
for all 
Let have derivatives of all orders in an open interval centered at 
The Taylor

Or, even when it is convergent, it may
fail to have

then the next 
theorem tells us that the Taylor series for actually converges to

For a Taylor series, the

The guidelines for finding a Taylor series for

The direct determination of Taylor or Maclaurin coefficients using successive
differentiation can be difficult, and the next example illustrates a shortcut for finding
the coefficients indirectly—using the coefficients of a known Taylor or Maclaurin
series.
Maclaurin Series for a Composite Function
Find the Maclaurin series for
Solution
To find the coefficients for this Maclaurin series directly, you must
calculate successive derivatives of 
By calculating just the first two,
and
you can see that this task would be quite cumbersome. Fortunately, there is an
alternative. First, consider the Maclaurin series for sin found in Example 1.
Now, because 
you can substitute 
for in the series for 
to obtain
Be sure to understand the point illustrated in Example 3. Because direct
computation of Taylor or Maclaurin coefficients can be tedious, the most practical way
to find a Taylor or Maclaurin series is to develop power series for a basic list of elementary
functions. From this list, you can determine power series for other functions by the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, integration,
and composition with known power series.

REMARK
When you have
difficulty recognizing a pattern,
remember that you can use
Theorem 9.22 to find the Taylor
series. Also, you can try using
the coefficients of a known
Taylor or Maclaurin series,
as shown in Example 3.

Binomial Series
Before presenting the basic list for elementary functions, you will develop one more
series—for a function of the form 
This produces the binomial series.
Binomial Series
Find the Maclaurin series for 
and determine its radius of convergence.
Assume that is not a positive integer and 
Solution
By successive differentiation, you have
which produces the series
Because 
you can apply the Ratio Test to conclude that the radius of
convergence is 
So, the series converges to some function in the interval
Note that Example 4 shows that the Taylor series for 
converges to some
function in the interval 
However, the example does not show that the series
actually converges to 
To do this, you could show that the remainder 
converges to 0, as illustrated in Example 2. You now have enough information to find a
binomial series for a function, as shown in the next example.

1. Cantor Set
The Cantor set (Georg Cantor, 1845–1918) is a
subset of the unit interval 
To construct the Cantor set,
first remove the middle third 
of the interval, leaving two
line segments. For the second step, remove the middle third of
each of the two remaining segments, leaving four line segments.

Conic Sections
Each conic section (or simply conic) can be described as the intersection of a plane and
a double-napped cone. Notice in Figure 10.1 that for the four basic conics, the intersecting
plane does not pass through the vertex of the cone. When the plane passes through the
vertex, the resulting figure is a degenerate conic, as shown in Figure 10.2.

There are several ways to study conics. You could begin as the Greeks did, by 
defining the conics in terms of the intersections of planes and cones, or you could define
them algebraically in terms of the general second-degree equation
General second-degree equation
However, a third approach, in which each of the conics is defined as a locus (collection)
of points satisfying a certain geometric property, works best. For example, a circle can
be defined as the collection of all points 
that are equidistant from a fixed point
This locus definition easily produces the standard equation of a circle

HYPATIA (370–415 A.D.)
The Greeks discovered conic 
sections sometime between 600
and 300 B.C. By the beginning of
the Alexandrian period, enough
was known about conics for
Apollonius (262–190 B.C.) to 
produce an eight-volume work on
the subject. Later, toward the end
of the Alexandrian period, Hypatia
wrote a textbook entitled On the
Conics of Apollonius. Her death
marked the end of major 
mathematical discoveries in
Europe for several hundred years.
The early Greeks were largely
concerned with the geometric
properties of conics. It was not
until 1900 years later, in the early
seventeenth century, that the
broader applicability of conics
became apparent. Conics then
played a prominent role in the
development of calculus.
See LarsonCalculus.com to read
more of this biography.

mathematical activities of Hypatia,

Mathematics” by Michael A. B.

Mathematical Monthly. To view

Parabolas
A parabola is the set of all points 
that are equidistant from a fixed line, the 
directrix, and a fixed point, the focus, not on the line. The midpoint between the focus
and the directrix is the vertex, and the line passing through the focus and the vertex is
the axis of the parabola. Note in Figure 10.3 that a parabola is symmetric with respect
to its axis.

To find the focus, convert to standard form by completing the square.

is negative, the parabola opens downward, as shown in Figure 10.4. So, the

A line segment that passes through the focus of a parabola and has endpoints on
the parabola is called a focal chord. The specific focal chord perpendicular to the axis
of the parabola is the latus rectum. The next example shows how to determine the
length of the latus rectum and the length of the corresponding intercepted arc.

Theorem 8.2
One widely used property of a parabola is its reflective property. In physics, a
surface is called reflective when the tangent line at any point on the surface makes equal
angles with an incoming ray and the resulting outgoing ray. The angle corresponding 
to the incoming ray is the angle of incidence, and the angle corresponding to the 
outgoing ray is the angle of reflection. One example of a reflective surface is a flat 
mirror.
Another type of reflective surface is that formed by revolving a parabola about its
axis. The resulting surface has the property that all incoming rays parallel to the axis
are directed through the focus of the parabola. This is the principle behind the design
of the parabolic mirrors used in reflecting telescopes. Conversely, all light rays emanating
from the focus of a parabolic reflector used in a flashlight are parallel, as shown in
Figure 10.6.

Ellipses
More than a thousand years after the close of the Alexandrian period of Greek
mathematics, Western civilization finally began a Renaissance of mathematical and 
scientific discovery. One of the principal figures in this rebirth was the Polish
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. In his work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly
Spheres, Copernicus claimed that all of the planets, including Earth, revolved about the
sun in circular orbits. Although some of Copernicus’s claims were invalid, the
controversy set off by his heliocentric theory motivated astronomers to search for a
mathematical model to explain the observed movements of the sun and planets. The
first to find an accurate model was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler
(1571–1630). Kepler discovered that the planets move about the sun in elliptical orbits,
with the sun not as the center but as a focal point of the orbit.
The use of ellipses to explain the movements of the planets is only one of many
practical and aesthetic uses. As with parabolas, you will begin your study of this 
second type of conic by defining it as a locus of points. Now, however, two focal points
are used rather than one.
An ellipse is the set of all points 
the sum of whose distances from two 
distinct fixed points called foci is constant. (See Figure 10.7.) The line through the foci
intersects the ellipse at two points, called the vertices. The chord joining the vertices is
the major axis, and its midpoint is the center of the ellipse. The chord perpendicular
to the major axis at the center is the minor axis of the ellipse. (See Figure 10.8.)
Figure 10.7
Figure 10.8
You can visualize the definition of an ellipse by imagining two thumbtacks placed
at the foci, as shown in Figure 10.9.

NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473–1543)
Copernicus began to study 
planetary motion when he was
asked to revise the calendar. At
that time, the exact length of the
year could not be accurately pre-
dicted using the theory that Earth
was the center of the universe.

Theorem 10.2 presented a reflective property of parabolas. Ellipses have a similar
reflective property. You are asked to prove the next theorem in Exercise 84.
One of the reasons that astronomers had difficulty detecting that the orbits of the
planets are ellipses is that the foci of the planetary orbits are relatively close to the 
center of the sun, making the orbits nearly circular. To measure the ovalness of an
ellipse, you can use the concept of eccentricity.
To see how this ratio is used to describe the shape of an ellipse, note that because
the foci of an ellipse are located along the major axis between the vertices and the 
center, it follows that
For an ellipse that is nearly circular, the foci are close to the center and the ratio 
is
close to 0, and for an elongated ellipse, the foci are close to the vertices and the ratio
is close to 1, as shown in Figure 10.12. Note that 
for every ellipse.
The orbit of the moon has an eccentricity of

Finding the Circumference of an Ellipse
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Show that the circumference of the ellipse 
is
Solution
Because the ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the 
axis 
and the 
axis, you know that its circumference 
is four times the arc length of 
in the first quadrant. The function is differentiable for all in the interval 
except
at 
So, the circumference is given by the improper integral
Using the trigonometric substitution 
you obtain
Because 
you can rewrite this integral as
A great deal of time has been devoted to the study of elliptic integrals. Such
integrals generally do not have elementary antiderivatives. To find the circumference of
an ellipse, you must usually resort to an approximation technique.
Approximating the Value of an Elliptic Integral
Use the elliptic integral in Example 5 to approximate the circumference of the ellipse 
Solution
Because 
you have
Applying Simpson’s Rule with 
produces
So, the ellipse has a circumference of about 28.36 units, as shown in Figure 10.13.

Hyperbolas
The definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse. For an ellipse, the sum
of the distances between the foci and a point on the ellipse is fixed, whereas for a 
hyperbola, the absolute value of the difference between these distances is fixed.
A hyperbola is the set of all points 
for which the absolute value of the
difference between the distances from two distinct fixed points called foci is constant.
(See Figure 10.14.) The line through the two foci intersects a hyperbola at two points
called the vertices. The line segment connecting the vertices is the transverse axis, and
the midpoint of the transverse axis is the center of the hyperbola. One distinguishing
feature of a hyperbola is that its graph has two separate branches.
Note that the constants 
and 
do not have the same relationship for 
hyperbolas as they do for ellipses. For hyperbolas,
but for ellipses,
An important aid in sketching the graph of a hyperbola is the determination of its
asymptotes, as shown in Figure 10.15. Each hyperbola has two asymptotes that
intersect at the center of the hyperbola. The asymptotes pass through the vertices of a
rectangle of dimensions 
by 
with its center at 
The line segment of length
joining
and
is referred to as the conjugate axis of the hyperbola.
In Figure 10.15, you can see that the asymptotes coincide with the diagonals of the
rectangle with dimensions 
and 
centered at 
This provides you with a quick
means of sketching the asymptotes, which in turn aids in sketching the hyperbola.

Begin by rewriting the equation in standard form.
The transverse axis is horizontal and the vertices occur at

The ends
of the conjugate axis occur at

Using these four points, you can
sketch the rectangle shown in Figure 10.16(a). By drawing the asymptotes through the

The application in Example 8 was developed during World War II. It shows how
the properties of hyperbolas can be used in radar and other detection systems.
A Hyperbolic Detection System
Two microphones, 1 mile apart, record an explosion. Microphone 
receives the sound
2 seconds before microphone 
Where was the explosion?
Solution
Assuming that sound travels at 1100 feet per second, you know that the
explosion took place 2200 feet farther from 
than from 
as shown in Figure 10.18.
The locus of all points that are 2200 feet closer to 
than to 
is one branch of the 
hyperbola 
where
and
Because 
it follows that
and you can conclude that the explosion occurred somewhere on the right branch of the
hyperbola
In Example 8, you were able to determine only the hyperbola on which the
explosion occurred, but not the exact location of the explosion. If, however, you had
received the sound at a third position 
then two other hyperbolas would be
determined. The exact location of the explosion would be the point at which these three
hyperbolas intersect.
Another interesting application of conics involves the orbits of comets in our solar
system. Of the 610 comets identified prior to 1970, 245 have elliptical orbits, 295 have
parabolic orbits, and 70 have hyperbolic orbits. The center of the sun is a focus of each
orbit, and each orbit has a vertex at the point at which the comet is closest to the sun.
Undoubtedly, many comets with parabolic or hyperbolic orbits have not been 
identified—such comets pass through our solar system only once. Only comets with
elliptical orbits, such as Halley’s comet, remain in our solar system.
The type of orbit for a comet can be determined as follows.
1. Ellipse:
2. Parabola:
3. Hyperbola:
In each of the above,
is the distance between one vertex and one focus of the comet’s
orbit (in meters),
is the velocity of the comet at the vertex (in meters per second),
kilograms is the mass of the sun, and 
cubic meters
per kilogram-second squared is the gravitational constant.

Plane Curves and Parametric Equations
Until now, you have been representing a graph by a single equation involving 
variables. In this section, you will study situations in which 
variables are used to
represent a curve in the plane.
Consider the path followed by an object 
that is propelled into the air at an angle of 
For an initial velocity of 48 feet per second,
the object travels the parabolic path given by
Rectangular equation
as shown in Figure 10.19. This equation,
however, does not tell the whole story. 
Although it does tell you where the object 
has been, it doesn’t tell you when the object 
was at a given point 
To determine 
this time, you can introduce a third variable 
called a parameter. By writing both and 
as functions of 
you obtain the parametric 
equations

From this set of equations, you can determine that at time 
the object is at the
point 
Similarly, at time 
the object is at the point 
and so on. (You will learn a method for determining this particular set of parametric
equations—the equations of motion—later, in Section 12.3.)
For this particular motion problem,

are continuous functions of

resulting path is called a plane curve.

At times, it is
important to distinguish
between a graph (the set of
points) and a curve (the points
together with their defining
parametric equations). When 
it is important, the distinction 
will be explicit. When it is not
important,

When sketching a curve represented by a set of parametric equations, you can plot
points in the 
plane. Each set of coordinates 
is determined from a value chosen
for the parameter 
By plotting the resulting points in order of increasing values of 
the curve is traced out in a specific direction. This is called the orientation of the curve.
Sketching a Curve
Sketch the curve described by the parametric equations
and
where 
Solution
For values of on the given interval,
the parametric equations yield the points 
shown in the table.
By plotting these points in order of increasing
and using the continuity of and 
you
obtain the curve 
shown in Figure 10.20. 
Note that the arrows on the curve indicate 
its orientation as increases from 
to 3.
According to the Vertical Line Test, the graph shown in Figure 10.20 does not
define 
as a function of 
This points out one benefit of parametric equations––they
can be used to represent graphs that are more general than graphs of functions.
It often happens that two different sets of parametric equations have the same
graph. For instance, the set of parametric equations
and
has the same graph as the set given in Example 1. (See Figure 10.21.) However,
comparing the values of in Figures 10.20 and 10.21, you can see that the second graph
is traced out more rapidly (considering 
as time) than the first graph. So, in 
applications, different parametric representations can be used to represent various
speeds at which objects travel along a given path.

Eliminating the Parameter
Finding a rectangular equation that represents the graph of a set of parametric equations
is called eliminating the parameter. For instance, you can eliminate the parameter
from the set of parametric equations in Example 1 as follows.
Once you have eliminated the parameter, you can recognize that the equation
represents a parabola with a horizontal axis and vertex at 
as
shown in Figure 10.20.
The range of 
and 
implied by the parametric equations may be altered by the
change to rectangular form. In such instances, the domain of the rectangular equation
must be adjusted so that its graph matches the graph of the parametric equations. Such
a situation is demonstrated in the next example.
Adjusting the Domain
Sketch the curve represented by the equations
and
by eliminating the parameter and adjusting the domain of the resulting rectangular
equation.
Solution
Begin by solving one of the parametric equations for 
For instance, you
can solve the first equation for as follows.
Parametric equation for 
Square each side.
Solve for 
Now, substituting into the parametric equation for produces
Parametric equation for 
Substitute 
for 
Simplify.
The rectangular equation,
is defined for all values of 
but from the
parametric equation for 
you can see that the curve is defined only when 
This
implies that you should restrict the domain of 
to positive values, as shown in 
Figure 10.22.

In Examples 2 and 3, it is important to realize that eliminating the parameter is 
primarily an aid to curve sketching. When the parametric equations represent the path
of a moving object, the graph alone is not sufficient to describe the object’s motion. You
still need the parametric equations to tell you the position, direction, and speed at a
given time.

Finding Parametric Equations
The first three examples in this section illustrate techniques for sketching the graph 
represented by a set of parametric equations. You will now investigate the reverse 
problem. How can you determine a set of parametric equations for a given graph or a
given physical description? From the discussion following Example 1, you know that
such a representation is not unique. This is demonstrated further in the next example,
which finds two different parametric representations for a given graph.
Finding Parametric Equations for a Given Graph

TECHNOLOGY
To be efficient at using a graphing utility, it is important that
you develop skill in representing a graph by a set of parametric equations. The 
reason for this is that many graphing utilities have only three graphing modes––
(1) functions, (2) parametric equations, and (3) polar equations. Most graphing 
utilities are not programmed to graph a general equation. For instance, suppose you
want to graph the hyperbola 
To graph the hyperbola in function mode,
you need two equations

Parametric Equations for a Cycloid
Determine the curve traced by a point 
on the circumference of a circle of radius 
rolling along a straight line in a plane. Such a curve is called a cycloid.

begin at the origin. When

CYCLOIDS
Galileo first called attention to
the cycloid, once recommending
that it be used for the arches of
bridges. Pascal once spent 8 days
attempting to solve many of the
problems of cycloids, such as find-
ing the area under one arch and
finding the volume of the solid 
of revolution formed by revolving
the curve about a line.The cycloid
has so many interesting properties
and has caused so many quarrels
among mathematicians that it has
been called “the Helen of geometry”
and “the apple of discord.”

Rolling Curves” by John Bloom
and Lee Whitt in The American
Mathematical Monthly. To view

The Tautochrone and Brachistochrone Problems
The curve described in Example 5 is related to one of the most famous pairs of problems
in the history of calculus. The first problem (called the tautochrone problem) began
with Galileo’s discovery that the time required to complete a full swing of a pendulum
is approximately the same whether it makes a large movement at high speed or a small
movement at lower speed (see Figure 10.26). Late in his life, Galileo realized that he
could use this principle to construct a clock. However, he was not able to conquer the
mechanics of actual construction. Christian Huygens (1629–1695) was the first to
design and construct a working model. In his work with pendulums, Huygens realized
that a pendulum does not take exactly the same time to complete swings of varying
lengths. (This doesn’t affect a pendulum clock, because the length of the circular arc is
kept constant by giving the pendulum a slight boost each time it passes its lowest point.)
But, in studying the problem, Huygens discovered that a ball rolling back and forth on
an inverted cycloid does complete each cycle in exactly the same time.
The second problem, which was posed by John Bernoulli in 1696, is called the
brachistochrone problem—in Greek, brachys means short and chronos means time.
The problem was to determine the path down which a particle (such as a ball) will slide
from point 
to point 
in the shortest time. Several mathematicians took up the 
challenge, and the following year the problem was solved by Newton, Leibniz,
L’Hôpital, John Bernoulli, and James Bernoulli. As it turns out, the solution is not a
straight line from 
to 
but an inverted cycloid passing through the points 
and 
as
shown in Figure 10.27.
An inverted cycloid is the path down which
a ball will roll in the shortest time.
Figure 10.27
The amazing part of the solution to the brachistochrone problem is that a particle 
starting at rest at any point 
of the cycloid between 
and 
will take exactly the same
time to reach 
as shown in Figure 10.28.
A ball starting at point 
takes the same time
to reach point 
as one that starts at point

Slope and Tangent Lines
Now that you can represent a graph in the plane by a set of parametric equations, it is
natural to ask how to use calculus to study plane curves. Consider the projectile 
represented by the parametric equations
and
as shown in Figure 10.29. From the discussion at the beginning of Section 10.2, you
know that these equations enable you to locate the position of the projectile at a given
time. You also know that the object is initially projected at an angle of 
or a slope
of 
But how can you find the slope at some other time 
The next 
theorem answers this question by giving a formula for the slope of the tangent line as a
function of 
Proof
In Figure 10.30, consider 
and let
and
Because 
as 
you can write
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 
you can use the differentiability

In the preceding section, you saw that if a circle rolls along a line, then a point on
its circumference will trace a path called a cycloid. If the circle rolls around the 
circumference of another circle, then the path of the point is an epicycloid. The next
example shows how to find the arc length of an epicycloid.
Finding Arc Length
A circle of radius 1 rolls around the circumference of a larger circle of radius 4, as
shown in Figure 10.33. The epicycloid traced by a point on the circumference of the
smaller circle is given by
and
Find the distance traveled by the point in one complete trip about the larger circle.
Solution
Before applying Theorem 10.8, note in Figure 10.33 that the curve has
sharp points when 
and 
Between these two points,
and 
are
not simultaneously 0. So, the portion of the curve generated from 
to 
is
smooth. To find the total distance traveled by the point, you can find the arc length of
that portion lying in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.

Polar Coordinates and Polar Graphs
Understand the polar coordinate system.
Rewrite rectangular coordinates and equations in polar form and vice versa.
Sketch the graph of an equation given in polar form.
Find the slope of a tangent line to a polar graph.
Identify several types of special polar graphs.
Polar Coordinates
So far, you have been representing graphs as collections of points 
on the 
rectangular coordinate system. The corresponding equations for these graphs have been
in either rectangular or parametric form. In this section, you will study a coordinate
system called the polar coordinate system.
To form the polar coordinate system in the plane, fix a point 
called the pole (or
origin), and construct from 
an initial ray called the polar axis, as shown in 
Figure 10.35. Then each point 
in the plane can be assigned polar coordinates
as follows.
Figure 10.36 shows three points on the polar coordinate system. Notice that in this
system, it is convenient to locate points with respect to a grid of concentric circles 
intersected by radial lines through the pole.
(a)
(b)
(c)
Figure 10.36
With rectangular coordinates, each point 
has a unique representation. This is
not true with polar coordinates. For instance, the coordinates
and
represent the same point [see parts (b) and (c) in Figure 10.36]. Also, because 
is a
directed distance, the coordinates 
and
represent the same point. In general, the point 
can be written as
or
where is any integer. Moreover, the pole is represented by 
where is any angle.

Coordinate Conversion
To establish the relationship between polar and rectangular coordinates, let the polar
axis coincide with the positive 
axis and the pole with the origin, as shown in 
Figure 10.37. Because 
lies on a circle of radius 
it follows that
Moreover, for

Polar Graphs
One way to sketch the graph of a polar equation is to convert to rectangular coordinates
and then sketch the graph of the rectangular equation.
Graphing Polar Equations
Describe the graph of each polar equation. Confirm each description by converting to a
rectangular equation.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points that are two units from
the pole. So, this graph is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2. [See
Figure 10.40(a).] You can confirm this by using the relationship 
to
obtain the rectangular equation
Rectangular equation
b. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points on the line that makes
an angle of 
with the positive axis. [See Figure 10.40(b).] You can confirm this
by using the relationship 
to obtain the rectangular equation
Rectangular equation
c. The graph of the polar equation 
is not evident by simple inspection, so you
can begin by converting to rectangular form using the relationship 
Polar equation
Rectangular equation
From the rectangular equation, you can see that the graph is a vertical line. [See
Figure 10.40(c).]

TECHNOLOGY
Sketching the graphs of complicated polar equations by hand
can be tedious. With technology, however, the task is not difficult. If your graphing
utility has a polar mode, use it to graph the equations in the exercise set. If your
graphing utility doesn’t have a polar mode, but does have a parametric mode, you
can graph 
by writing the equation as
For instance, the graph of 
shown in 
Figure 10.41 was produced with a graphing 
calculator in parametric mode. This equation 
was graphed using the parametric equations
with the values of varying from 
to 
This curve is of the form 
and is called 
a spiral of Archimedes.

After some experimentation, you will find that the entire curve, which is called a rose
curve, can be sketched by letting vary from 0 to 
as shown in Figure 10.42. If you
try duplicating this graph with a graphing utility, you will find that by letting 
vary
from 0 to 
you will actually trace the entire curve twice.

Slope and Tangent Lines
To find the slope of a tangent line to a polar graph, consider a differentiable function
given by 
To find the slope in polar form, use the parametric equations
and
Using the parametric form of 
given in Theorem 10.7, you have
which establishes the next theorem.
From Theorem 10.11, you can make the following observations.
1. Solutions of 
yield horizontal tangents, provided that 
2. Solutions of 
yield vertical tangents, provided that 
If 
and 
are simultaneously 0, then no conclusion can be drawn about 
tangent lines.
Finding Horizontal and Vertical Tangent Lines

Solution
Begin by writing the equation in parametric form.
and
Next, differentiate and with respect to and set each derivative equal to 0.
So, the graph has vertical tangent lines at

Finding Horizontal and Vertical Tangent Lines
Find the horizontal and vertical tangents to the graph of 
Solution
Let 
and then differentiate with respect to 
Setting 
equal to 0, you can see that 
and 
So,
when 
and 0. Similarly, using 
you have
Setting 
equal to 0, you can see that 
and 
So, you can 
conclude that 
when 
and 
From these results, and from
the graph shown in Figure 10.46, you can conclude that the graph has horizontal 
tangents at 
and 
and has vertical tangents at 
and 
This graph is called a cardioid. Note that both derivatives 
and
are 0 when 
Using this information alone, you don’t know whether the
graph has a horizontal or vertical tangent line at the pole. From Figure 10.46, however,
you can see that the graph has a cusp at the pole.
Theorem 10.11 has an important consequence. If the graph of 
passes
through the pole when 
and 
then the formula for 
simplifies as
follows.
So, the line 
is tangent to the graph at the pole,
Theorem 10.12 is useful because it states that the zeros of 
can be used to
find the tangent lines at the pole. Note that because a polar curve can cross the pole
more than once, it can have more than one tangent line at the pole. For example, the
rose curve 
has three tangent lines at the pole, as shown in Figure 10.47.
For this curve,
cos 
is 0 when 
is 
and 
Moreover, the 
derivative 
is not 0 for these values of .

Find the area of a surface of revolution (polar form).
Area of a Polar Region
The development of a formula for the area of a polar region
parallels that for the area of a region on the rectangular 
coordinate system, but uses sectors of a circle instead of 
rectangles as the basic elements of area. In Figure 10.48,
note that the area of a circular sector of radius is 
provided is measured in radians.
Consider the function 
where is continuous 
and nonnegative on the interval 
The region
bounded by the graph of and the radial lines 
and
is shown in Figure 10.49(a). To find the area of this 
region, partition the interval 
into equal subintervals
Then approximate the area of the region by the sum of the areas of the 
sectors, as
shown in Figure 10.49(b).
Taking the limit as 
produces
which leads to the next theorem.
You can use the formula in Theorem 10.13 to find the area of a region bounded by
the graph of a continuous nonpositive function. The formula is not necessarily valid,
however, when takes on both positive and negative values in the interval , .

Points of Intersection of Polar Graphs
Because a point may be represented in different ways in polar coordinates, care must
be taken in determining the points of intersection of two polar graphs. For example,
consider the points of intersection of the graphs of
and
as shown in Figure 10.52. As with rectangular equations, you can attempt to find the
points of intersection by solving the two equations simultaneously, as shown.
First equation
Substitute 
from 2nd equation into 1st equation.
Simplify.
Solve for
The corresponding points of intersection are 
and 
From Figure
10.52, however, you can see that there is a third point of intersection that did not show
up when the two polar equations were solved simultaneously. (This is one reason why
you should sketch a graph when finding the area of a polar region.) The reason the third
point was not found is that it does not occur with the same coordinates in the two
graphs. On the graph of 
the point occurs with coordinates 
but on the
graph of
the point occurs with coordinates 
In addition to solving equations simultaneously and sketching a graph, note that
because the pole can be represented by 
where 
is any angle, you should check
separately for the pole when finding points of intersection.
You can compare the problem of finding points of intersection of two polar graphs
with that of finding collision points of two satellites in intersecting orbits about Earth,
as shown in Figure 10.53. The satellites will not collide as long as they reach the points
of intersection at different times ( -values). Collisions will occur only at the points of
intersection that are “simultaneous points”—those that are reached at the same time 
( -value).
The paths of satellites can cross without 
causing a collision.

Finding the Area of a Region Between Two Curves
Find the area of the region common to the two regions bounded by the curves.
Circle
and
Cardioid
Solution
Because both curves are symmetric with respect to the 
axis, you can
work with the upper half-plane, as shown in Figure 10.54. The blue shaded region lies
between the circle and the radial line
Because the circle has coordinates 
at the pole, you can integrate between 
and 
to obtain the area of this region. The region that is shaded red is bounded by
the radial lines 
and 
and the cardioid. So, you can find the area of this
second region by integrating between 
and 
The sum of these two integrals gives
the area of the common region lying above the radial line 
Region between circle
Region between cardioid and
and radial line 
radial lines 
and 
Finally, multiplying by 2, you can conclude that the total area is
Area of region inside circle and cardioid
To check the reasonableness of this result, note that the area of the circular region is
Area of circle
So, it seems reasonable that the area of the region lying inside the circle and the 
cardioid is 
To see the benefit of polar coordinates for finding the area in Example 3, consider
the integral below, which gives the comparable area in rectangular coordinates.
Use the integration capabilities of a graphing utility to show that you obtain the same
area as that found in Example 3.

Conics, Parametric Equations, and Polar Coordinates
10.6
Polar Equations of Conics and Kepler’s Laws
Analyze and write polar equations of conics.
Understand and use Kepler’s Laws of planetary motion.
Polar Equations of Conics
In this chapter, you have seen that the rectangular equations of ellipses and hyperbolas
take simple forms when the origin lies at their centers. As it happens, there are many
important applications of conics in which it is more convenient to use one of the foci as
the reference point (the origin) for the coordinate system. For example, the sun lies at
a focus of Earth’s orbit. Similarly, the light source of a parabolic reflector lies at its
focus. In this section, you will see that polar equations of conics take simpler forms
when one of the foci lies at the pole.
The next theorem uses the concept of eccentricity, as defined in Section 10.1, to
classify the three basic types of conics.
In Figure 10.57, note that for each type of conic, the pole corresponds to the fixed
point (focus) given in the definition.
Ellipse:
Parabola:
Hyperbola:
Figure 10.57
The benefit of locating a focus of a conic at the pole is that the equation of the conic
becomes simpler, as seen in the proof of the next theorem.

Proof
This is a proof for 
with 
In Figure 10.58, consider a
vertical directrix 
units to the right of the focus 
If 
is a point on
the graph of 
then the distance between 
and the directrix can
be shown to be
Because the distance between 
and the pole is simply 
the ratio of 
to 
is 
and, by Theorem 10.16, the graph of the equation must be a conic. The proofs of the
other cases are similar. 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The four types of equations indicated in Theorem 10.17 can be classified as
follows, where 
a. Horizontal directrix above the pole:
b. Horizontal directrix below the pole:
c. Vertical directrix to the right of the pole:
d. Vertical directrix to the left of the pole:
Figure 10.59 illustrates these four possibilities for a parabola. Note that for 
convenience, the equation for the directrix is shown in rectangular form.

Determining a Conic from Its Equation
Sketch the graph of the conic 
Solution
To determine the type of conic, rewrite the equation as
Write original equation.
So, the graph is an ellipse with 
You can sketch the upper half of the ellipse by
plotting points from 
to 
as shown in Figure 10.60. Then, using symmetry
with respect to the polar axis, you can sketch the lower half.
For the ellipse in Figure 10.60, the major axis is horizontal and the vertices lie at
(15, 0) and 
So, the length of the major axis is 
To find the length of the
minor axis, you can use the equations 
and 
to conclude that

Kepler’s Laws
Kepler’s Laws, named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, can be used to
describe the orbits of the planets about the sun.
1. Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun as a focus.
2. A ray from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse in equal times.
3. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the mean distance between
the planet and the sun.*
Although Kepler derived these laws empirically, they were later validated by Newton.
In fact, Newton was able to show that each law can be deduced from a set of
universal laws of motion and gravitation that govern the movement of all heavenly 
bodies, including comets and satellites. This is shown in the next example,
involving the comet named after the English mathematician and physicist Edmund
Halley (1656–1742).
Halley’s Comet
Halley’s comet has an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus and has an eccentricity
of 
The length of the major axis of the orbit is approximately 
35.88 astronomical units (AU). (An astronomical unit is defined as the mean distance
between Earth and the sun, 93 million miles.) Find a polar equation for the orbit. How
close does Halley’s comet come to the sun?
Solution
Using a vertical axis, you can choose an equation of the form
Because the vertices of the ellipse occur when 
and 
you can
determine the length of the major axis to be the sum of the values of the vertices, as
shown in Figure 10.62. That is,
So,
and
Using this value in the equation produces
where 
is measured in astronomical units. To find the closest point to the sun (the
focus), you can write 
Because is the distance between the focus and the center, the closest point is
miles.

Kepler’s Second Law states that as a planet moves about the sun, a ray from the sun
to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This law can also be applied to
comets or asteroids with elliptical orbits. For example, Figure 10.63 shows the orbit of
the asteroid Apollo about the sun. Applying Kepler’s Second Law to this asteroid, you
know that the closer it is to the sun, the greater its velocity, because a short ray must be
moving quickly to sweep out as much area as a long ray.
A ray from the sun to the asteroid Apollo sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
Figure 10.63
The Asteroid Apollo
The asteroid Apollo has a period of 661 Earth days, and its orbit is approximated by the
ellipse
where is measured in astronomical units. How long does it take Apollo to move from
the position 
to 
as shown in Figure 10.64?
Solution
Begin by finding the area swept out as increases from 
to 
Formula for area of a polar graph
Using the substitution 
as discussed in Section 8.6, you obtain
Because the major axis of the ellipse has length 
and the eccentricity is
you can determine that
So, the area of the ellipse is
Area of ellipse
Because the time required to complete the orbit is 661 days, you can apply Kepler’s
Second Law to conclude that the time required to move from the position 
to 
is
which implies that 
109 days.

59. The graphs of the approximating polynomial 
and the 
elementary function both pass through the point 
and
the slope of the graph of 
is the same as the slope of the graph
of at the point 
If 
is of degree 
then the first 
derivatives of and 
agree at 
This allows the graph of 
to
resemble the graph of near the point 
61. See “Definitions of 
Taylor Polynomial and 
Maclaurin
Polynomial” on page 638.
63. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the graph of the
Taylor polynomial becomes a better and better approximation
of the function within the interval of convergence. Therefore,
the accuracy is increased.
