Preface
Blueprints are manufacturing instructions and generally contain a drawing,
dimensions, and notes. Blueprints originate in the engineering department and
give the manufacturing department all the information that is needed to
manufacture a product. The term “blueprint” originated years ago when these
prints had a blue background and white lines. Today, most prints have a white
background and black lines. They are still, however, often called “blueprints.”
Many organizations do not use the term “blueprint” and instead use such names
as “prints,” “drawings,” or “manufacturing prints.” The term “blueprint” is,
however, generally well understood. Architectural blueprints are plans to
construct buildings. The term is also commonly used to describe a plan to
accomplish a goal. In the text, a blueprint will be called a “print” or a
“manufacturing print.”
The most important part of a print is the drawing, and the most important
part of print reading is the ability to visualize that drawing. Since this ability to
form a mental picture of the drawing is the most difficult part of print reading for
many students, Blueprint Reading Basics reviews this subject in great detail,
using many illustrations and examples, as well as thoroughly reviewing all other
aspects of print reading.
Each chapter of Blueprint Reading Basics covers one subject and includes an
introduction, a detailed review of the subject, illustrations, review questions, and
worksheets. In order to concentrate on print reading, discussions of related
subjects such as mathematics, engineering, drafting techniques, and machine
shop practices are kept to a minimum. A thorough knowledge of these subjects is
desirable, but such knowledge is not essential to learning to read prints. There
are also no exercises that require special skills such as freehand drawing; such
skills are useful, but they are not needed to interpret prints.
Industry practices, industry standards, and copies of industrial prints are
included throughout the text. The resulting combination of print reading theory
and industry applications produces a book that is oriented toward practical
concerns.
Blueprint Reading Basics is intended for classroom use in a one- or two-
semester course in print reading; it can also be used for selfstudy. Because of its
easy-to-understand writing style and use of many illustrations, prints, and
examples, Blueprint Reading Basics can be used profitably by anyone who must

learn to read prints.

Worksheets
Each chapter has one or more worksheets that provide basic and practical
training. Most of the worksheets were designed as teaching aids, but there are
also many worksheets that include industrial prints. This combination of basic
teaching exercises along with industrial prints provides a practical approach to
print reading. Worksheet questions are short and specific. There should be little
or no confusion about the meaning of a question. Questions require short and
specific answers.
It must be noted that the exercises were designed as teaching aids and there
are a great number of questions that require calculating dimensions. This method
has proved to be the most effective way of learning how to read prints. On the
other hand, prints that are used in industry are dimensioned, so calculations are
not required. When working with industrial prints, use the data that are shown on
the print. Do not make calculations unless they are necessary.

Worksheet Guides
Some of the worksheets have guides that either establish general rules for all
worksheets or help answer specific questions. All worksheet guides should be
reviewed. In some cases, similar guides are shown on more than one worksheet.
Some students may not have a need for some of the guides, while other students
will find them very helpful. The guides are located throughout the text as they
apply to worksheets. This arrangement makes them more meaningful and easier
to remember instead of having them all located at the beginning of the book.
When reviewing worksheets, it is important to get the correct answer, but it
is also important to understand how the answer was obtained. Knowledge of
how answers are obtained will build a base for understanding future worksheets
as they become more complicated.

Industry Standards
Industry standards for such things as threads and gears are referred to throughout
the text. When a print refers to an item that has a standard, the entire standard
applies. As an example, in a print that specifies a 1/4-20 UNC-2A thread, UN
stands for “Unified,” and it has an industry standard. The standard specifies all
data pertaining to Unified threads, such as maximum and minimum diameters.
These details therefore do not have to appear on a print. Industry standards are a
very important part of manufacturing and keep prints uncluttered.

Third Edition
Blueprint Reading Basics has been a popular textbook in the academic and
industrial world for many years. The third edition concludes over ten years of
classroom and industrial experience. Many instructors and students have made
worthwhile contributions to make it a practical text. The most effective learning
tools in the text are the worksheets.
After reviewing the text on a specific subject, the worksheets provide
effective and practical means of review and make the subject easier to
understand. This method has proved to be very effective in the learning process.
The third edition has many new and rearranged worksheets to make this process
easier to follow. Many of the worksheets have been revised so they can be
completed after studying one subject. This means some of the worksheets can be
reviewed before studying the entire chapter. As an example, in Chapter 3,
Worksheet 3-2 can be completed after studying “The Lines of Manufacturing
Prints.” Worksheets are practical and effective. Worksheets work.

Fourth Edition
Hammer’s Blueprint Reading Basics has been a favorite of beginners and
educators for decades. It is praised for its complete coverage of the basics, for its
ease of understanding, and for giving learners opportunities to practice what they
have learned.
The fourth edition presented an opportunity to modernize and expand the
text to make it useful to students in the modern workforce. It also presented a
challenge to ensure it retained the qualities of the original: simple, direct, down-
to-earth, and friendly.
Several chapters have been expanded and material has been re-arranged for
better presentation. Chapter 3 focuses on engineering drawing practices and the
total print. Chapter 4 contains additional types of views and drawing techniques.
Chapters 5 and 6 expand the treatment of dimensioning and tolerancing
techniques with more illustrated examples. Geometric Dimensioning &
Tolerancing has been moved to follow in Chapter 7, and been re-written for a
better flow. Chapters on surface texture and treatments, threads, and gears have
all been expanded. New material has been added to existing chapters covering
splines and cam prints. New chapters have been added covering cast, forged, and
molded plastic prints; and welded and sheet metal prints.
The figures and prints in the fourth edition contain a combination of both
millimeter and inch values, recognizing the fact that both units of measure are
common in industry. You are likely in your career to encounter both units on
prints. Metric drawings have been given a full and equal presentation along with
English drawings.
Engineering prints made to current practices rely much more on symbols
than English words to convey design requirements so anyone across the globe
can understand them, regardless of where they were made. These symbols and
drawing standards allow all manufacturing professionals to successfully interpret
the meaning of prints without subjectivity or ambiguity. The fourth edition
presents symbols and standards currently used and commonly encountered on
prints while recognizing students are still likely to encounter prints made
according to prior practices.
All the hand-drawn figures and prints of the previous edition have been
replaced with CADgenerated figures to give the reader a clear and professional
appearing textbook. Except for the sample prints donated from industry, all the
figures have been replaced. To present the expanded content, the number of
figures has been increased by over 50 percent. Worksheets have been added and
updated to give the student broad practice on all textbook concepts.

Review Questions

Introduction
Blueprints document the requirements of manufactured parts. These
requirements include geometric requirements: the intended size, shape,
dimensions, and amount of variation that is acceptable. Requirements also
include information like material, finish, special assembly and processing

instructions, and inspection instructions. They originate in the engineering
department and give all the downstream users the information that is needed to
make the part. Blueprints transform ideas into products and communicate
information among all parties involved, such as customers, sales, designers,
drafters, purchasers, routers, machinists, machine operators, assemblers, and
inspectors.
The term “blueprint” originated years ago when prints were blue. Prints had
blue backgrounds and white lines. Today most prints are white and have black
lines, but they are still sometimes called blueprints. Other more common names
are “prints,” “drawings,” “specifications,” “manufacturing prints,” “engineering
drawings,” “dimensional specifications,” and “industrial prints.”
The three basic elements of a manufacturing print are the drawing,
dimensions, and notes. Prints contain all the information that is needed to make a
finished product, either explicitly or referenced in associated documents. A
finished product may be anything from a simple part to a complex assembly.
Quantities of parts to be made may range from one to millions. Manufacturing
organizations range in size from small machine shops to large industrial
corporations and often involve suppliers and service providers outside the
manufacturer’s organization. In all cases, prints provide the common definition
of the finished product requirements around which all manufacturing activities
are arranged.
Industrial prints use an orderly and systematic graphic language. They
present data in an easy-to-understand form. Prints are rather easy to read, if the
principles are studied one step at a time. Print reading is similar to mathematics;
it takes work and time to learn at the beginning. Once learned, it becomes easy;
and once learned, it is not forgotten. Print reading is an essential skill for
working in any manufacturing capacity.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a broad overview of manufacturing
prints. Additional information will be presented on each item in subsequent
chapters.
Before starting to study print reading, it is recommended that you obtain a 1-
inch angle bracket, similar to the one shown in Figure 1-1. The bracket will
serve as a helpful visual aid. A comparison between the actual bracket and all the
figures in Chapters 1 and 2 will make it much easier to visualize all the
drawings.
The prints in this book contain a combination of both millimeter and inch
values, recognizing the fact that both units of measure are common in industry.
You are likely in your career to encounter both metric and English prints.
The Manufacturing Cycle

The manufacturing cycle revolves around prints. Ideas are transformed to
manufacturing prints, and they are used to manufacture finished products.
Finished products are distributed and sold to customers. As products are used,
changes and improvements are recommended. Worthwhile improvements are
adopted, and drawings are changed accordingly. Improved products are
manufactured, and then they are sold to customers. This is a continuous cycle, as
shown in Figure 1-2.
The Manufacturing Print
Manufacturing prints have three basic elements: a drawing, dimensions, and
notes; see Figure 1-1. These items will be reviewed throughout the book. A brief
description follows so a good overall picture can be formed early in the study.
Figure 1-1 Drawing, dimensions, and notes 

Figure 1-2 The manufacturing cycle revolves around prints.

Drawing
The main part of a manufacturing print is the drawing; see Figure 1-3. The
drawing shows the exact shape of a part. Drawings may contain a single view of
the part or several views. They have as many views as necessary to visualize the
part. An example drawing composed of three views labeled “top,” “front,” and
“side” is shown in Figure 1-4. Drawings with multiple views are arranged
following a system of straight-line projections between views, as shown in
Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-3 The main part of a print: the drawing 

Figure 1-4 Three views 

Figure 1-5 Views are straight-line projections of the part.

Dimensions
Every feature of every part has a dimension, and each dimension includes a
tolerance. The dimensions describe the exact geometry of the intended part, and
tolerances indicate how closely manufacturing needs to match the dimensions to
produce parts that are considered acceptable; see Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6 Dimensions indicate the exact size and shape requirements
for the part.

Notes
Notes include such things as material, finish, surface treatments, and any other
information that is needed to manufacture the part; see Figure 1-1 again.

Introduction
Print reading is the process of analyzing a print to obtain information and
involves two activities: visualization and interpretation. Visualization is the

ability to envision, or “see,” the shape of a three-dimensional object from the
various views shown on a two-dimensional print. Learning the principles of
projection will help you gain the ability to visualize objects from views shown
on a print.
A machinist must visualize a part from a print before it can be made. After a
part is made, an inspector generally checks the part to see if it conforms to the
drawing. The inspector must form a mental picture of the part from the drawing
in order to inspect the part.
The interpretation of lines, symbols, dimensions, notes, and other
information on a print is the other important part of print reading. Many of the
common symbols used on prints are presented and explained. Numerous
examples and opportunities to test your knowledge are presented in the chapters
that follow.
In this chapter, you will learn how to form a mental picture of a typical
manufactured part. This will be accomplished by reviewing the following items: 
 Types of drawings  Projections  Visualization Types of Drawings
Drawings are either artistic or technical. Artistic drawings may be abstract or
realistic and may depict intangible concepts, such as love, or concrete objects,
such as a landscape. Perspective projection is common for realistic drawings.
Interpretation is subjective, and few standards exist for artists to follow. There
are many good art books at your local library.
This book is about technical drawings. Technical drawings represent
concrete objects to be built or constructed in a realistic manner, using parallel
projections according to standards designed to ensure there is only one possible
interpretation. Subjectivity and ambiguity are the enemy of successful
communication using technical drawings.
Technical drawings are used for civil engineering, surveying, construction,
and architecture. Although many conventions are the same across all types of
technical drawings, within each of these fields different standards are followed,
and different objects are likely to be illustrated. This book is about technical
drawings used for engineering and manufacturing purposes.
Projections
Drawings are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional parts to be
built. Creating a two-dimensional representation of a threedimensional part
requires the drafter to project the part onto a two-dimensional surface. There are
many methods of projection used for various purposes. The process of projection
can be illustrated using four concepts: the object being projected, the plane of
projection, projection lines, and the observer’s viewpoint, as shown in Figure 2-
1.

Figure 2-1 Object, plane of projection, projection lines, viewpoint The
projection plane sits between the observer’s viewpoint and the object
being projected, and this represents the two-dimensional drawing.
Projection lines are straight lines that all begin at the observer’s viewpoint
and end on points of interest of the object. Along their path, they intersect
the plane of projection.
Your Shadow
The process of projection is not as strange as it might sound; we all experience
projection in our daily lives. Your shadow cast by the sun is a two-dimensional
projection of a three-dimensional object: you. When you project a shadow,
projection lines originate at the sun, and you sit between the sun and the plane of
projection; see Figure 2-2.

Figure 2-2 Your shadow is a projection Perspective
The perspective projection uses an observer’s viewpoint located at a finite
distance from the projection plane and the object. No projection line is parallel to
any other projection line.
A drawing made using the perspective projection is shown in Figure 2-3.
Note that the edges on the object that are parallel to one another do not
appear parallel on the perspective projection. Detail on the object that is farther
away appears smaller. The perspective projection approximates the appearance
of an object as observed by the eye.

Figure 2-3 Perspective Parallel
Parallel projection uses an observer’s viewpoint located an infinite distance from
the object. Stated differently, all projection lines are parallel to one another. This
has the effect that a line on the object is projected into a line on the projection
plane. Parallel lines on the object become parallel on the projection. The
midpoint of a line on the object is projected to the midpoint of the line of the
projection.
There are several types of parallel projections, each following slightly
different rules. The main types are orthographic projection and oblique
projection; see Figure 2-4.
In oblique projection, the projection lines cross the projection plane at a
nonperpendicular angle. Oblique projection includes the subtypes cabinet,
cavalier, and military; see Figure 2-4. Oblique projections were common as
recently as the nineteenth century in technical, architectural, and military
depictions. Modern blueprints use orthographic, not oblique, projection.

Figure 2-4 Orthographic versus oblique projections Orthographic
Projections
In an orthographic projection, the projection lines are perpendicular to the
projection plane. There are several subtypes of orthographic projections: 
Single -view, or axonometric, projection: − Isometric
− Dimetric

− Trimetric
 Multiview projection: − Third-angle projection
− First-angle projection
Figure 2-5 is an orthographic projection of the L-bracket, observed from the
front. The front surface of the object has been shaded to identify it. The same
type of projection for the top view is shown in Figure 2-6, and the side view is
shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-5 A front-view projection of an isometric drawing 

Figure 2-6 A top-view projection of an isometric drawing 

Figure 2-7 A side-view projection of an isometric drawing Single-View
Projections
Figure 2-8 illustrates three different ways of making a single-view orthographic
projection of the L-bracket. In each, the observer views the object from a
standard viewpoint defined by the angles shown. Though these viewpoints were
standardized based on the manual drafting techniques used to create them, CAD
projections of objects from one viewpoint are just as easy to make as projections
from any other viewpoint.
Prints for manufacturing may also contain any of the single-view projections,
but when these views are present, they only serve to assist visualization by
supplementing the main orthographic views, which are the primary means of
communicating the part’s design.
Multiview Projections
When more than one view appears on an orthographic drawing, all the views are
projected from each other, as seen in Figure 2-9. All views are at right angles to
each other, and all projections are straight lines. If a straight edge or rule is
placed along any line, a projection can be made to the other view. Projections
between the top view and the side view are turned at right angles, as shown in
Figure 2-9.


Figure 2-8 Isometric, dimetric, and trimetric projections of the L-bracket
When looking at one view, all lines on that view must be projected from
the other views. As an example, when looking at Figure 2-10, all lines for
the front view must be projected from the top view and the side view. All
lines for the front view of Figure 2-10 must coincide with the projection
lines shown.
All lines in the top view must also be projected from the front and side
views, as Figure 2-11 shows. All lines in the top view must be within the four
corners A, B, C, and D. Finally, all lines in the side view must be projected from
the top and front views; see Figure 2-12.
Figure 2-9 Projected views of an orthographic drawing 

Figure 2-10 All lines in the front view must be projected from the top and
side views.
Projection lines are generally not shown on prints except for special
projections. There is generally no need to show the lines as indicated in Figure
2-2.
A typical orthographic drawing with three views is shown in Figure 2-13.

Figure 2-11 All lines in the top view must be projected from the front and
side views.

Figure 2-12 All lines in the side view must be projected from the top and
front views.
Figure 2-13 A typical orthographic drawing with three views Projection

Systems
Engineering prints rely primarily on multiview orthographic projections to
illustrate the parts to be built. Prints for manufacturing are made using either of
the two internationally recognized systems: third-angle projection and first-angle
projection. Although you are likely to encounter both types, the illustrations and
examples in this text focus on third-angle projection, which is by far the most
widely used style in the United States. Some examples of first-angle projection
are given, which should be enough to familiarize you with that style so that you
can successfully visualize parts drawn using first-angle projection.
Third-Angle Projection
A part may be shown from all sides using six projected views. Most parts will
not require all six views, but the concept is useful for illustrating third-angle
projection and how the views are arranged in the drawing. One view is named
the “front” view and placed on the drawing. From there:  The top view is found
above.
 The bottom view is found underneath.
 The left-side view is found on the left.
 The right-side view is found on the right.
 The back view is found on the left or the right, as convenient.
The six basic views are arranged as if you were looking through the sides of
a glass box containing the part, and then the box was unfolded, as in Figure 2-14.
The six basic views of the L-bracket are shown in Figure 2-15.

Figure 2-14 Basic view arrangement First-Angle Projection
In the first-angle projection system, one view is named the “front” view and
placed on the drawing. From there:  The top view is found underneath.
 The bottom view is found above.
 The left-side view is found on the right.
 The right-side view is found on the left.
 The back view is found on the left or the right, as convenient.

The six basic views are arranged as though they were unfolded from a
rectangular box, but with the projection planes on the far side of the object from
the observer; see Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-15 Six basic views of a bracket: third-angle projection 

Figure 2-16 Six basic views of a bracket: first-angle projection
Projection Symbols
One of the projection symbols in Figure 2-17 may appear on the print, indicating
the projection system used. If no symbol appears, the drawing was likely created
with third-angle projection. Note the symbol is merely two views of a cone
shape drawn in either first- or third-angle projection.

Figure 2-17 Projection symbols Visualization
The ability to visualize a part from an orthographic drawing is the most
important aspect of print reading.
An example of forming a mental picture of a part is displayed in Figure 2-18.
Imagine the orthographic drawing as a manufacturing print and the isometric
drawing as the visualized part.

Figure 2-18 Visualizing a part from a drawing Interpretation
Prints serve as contract documents and are made based on standards or they are
not interpretable. Those reading a drawing know which standard is applicable
because this will be stated directly on the print, in a document referenced from
the print, or in other contractually imposed documents, such as a request for
quote. Where prints are meant to be read and interpreted within different
departments of the same company, company rules will dictate which standard
applies for interpreting prints.
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) authors and
publishes the most commonly used standards for interpreting prints in the United
States. The Dimensioning and Tolerancing standard, ASME Y14.5-2009, is often
referenced directly on the title block or note.
The ASME Y14.5 standard also invokes additional related standards such
that they do not need to be individually referenced, such as:  Decimal Inch
Drawing Sheet Size and Format: ASME Y14.1-2012
 Metric Drawing Sheet Size and Format: ASME Y14.1M-2012

 Line Conventions and Lettering: ASME Y14.2-2014
 Orthographic and Pictorial Views: ASME Y14.3-2012
 Screw Thread Representation: ASME Y14.6-2001
 Surface Texture Symbols: Y14.36M-1996, B46.1-2002
 Engineering Drawing Practices: ASME Y14.100-2013
In those cases where a print includes no reference to a standard and no
contractually imposed documents, and the print contains symbols from an ANSI
or ASME standard on dimensioning and tolerancing, the print is interpreted
according to the latest ASME Y14.5 standard published at the time the print was
created.
This textbook is based largely on the ASME standards. Where practices
governed by other standards are illustrated, they are noted by reference.

Chapter 2 Worksheets
The worksheets in Chapter 2 are designed to develop the ability to visualize a
drawing. The ability to form a mental picture of a drawing is the most important
and generally the most difficult part of print reading. A grasp of visualization
must be obtained as the first step towards interpreting prints. All aspects of print
reading originate from the drawing.
Students who have some print reading experience may find Chapter 2
worksheets rather easy. Students with no previous experience may find them
rather difficult and may need extra study time. Worksheets in subsequent
chapters will continue to improve visualization skills.
Worksheets 2-1 to 2-6
The first six worksheets require matching drawings of various shapes. The
drawings in the upper part of the page are in orthographic form, which is the way
they would appear on manufacturing prints. Each object has a front, top, and side
view. The drawings on the lower part of the page are in isometric form and are
much easier to visualize. The objective of the exercise is to match the shapes of
1, 2, 3, and 4 with the shapes of A, B, C, and D. As an example, in Worksheet 2-
1, the shape of 1 is the same as the shape of B.






Worksheets 2-7 to 2-11

The following five worksheets require the matching of surfaces between
isometric and orthographic drawings.
As an example, in Worksheet 2-7 Surface C in the upper drawing is the same
as Surface 2 in the front view, Surface 10 in the top view, and Surface 12 in the
side view.
Match the numbers 1−15, in the front, top, and side views with the letters A-E in
the upper drawing. Mark the matching number in the appropriate box. Numbers
2, 10, and 12 are already marked.

Worksheets 2-12 to 2-14
The next three worksheets have matching orthographic and isometric drawings.
One of the orthographic views, however, is not complete. The views can be
completed with short straight lines. Projection lines are shown between the
incomplete view and the other two views. Projection lines are not shown
between the completed views.
Note the guide below. There are projection lines between the incomplete
front view and the completed top and side views. Projection lines are not shown
between the top and side views because these views are complete. Note the
relationship between the projection lines and the missing line. Use the projection
lines to help visualize the missing lines in Worksheets 2-12 to 2-14.
Projection lines show the relationship of surfaces between views. They are
very important and very helpful when learning how to read blueprints. Projection
lines are not shown on industrial prints. Adding them to industrial prints and
future worksheets will help visualization.







Worksheets 2-15 to 2-19
The next five worksheets have matching orthographic and isometric drawings.
Each set has one or more orthographic views that are not complete. All of the
views have outlines that are complete. Projection lines are not shown.
The steps to complete each set are as follows:
1. Draw in the projection lines.
2. Identify the incomplete view(s).
3. Draw in the missing line or lines.
An example is shown below.

Introduction
The total manufacturing print refers to the various parts of a print and the way
they are arranged to form the total print. Prints generally have a border on all
sides, a title block, a revision history block, and one or more views annotated
with dimensions, tolerances, and other symbols and notes. Manufacturing prints
generally have one part or one assembly per sheet.
Prints from different organizations have many similarities, but they also have
differences.
When reading prints, all items must be reviewed carefully. It is important to
examine and understand the meaning of all the information on the print. The
purpose of this chapter is to review the total print, lines, notes and symbols,
views and scale, title blocks, and change systems.
Print Sizes
Prints come in various sizes set forth in the English print size standard ASME
Y14.1. Metric prints are made to the sizes in the ASME Y14.1M standard,
shown in Table 3-1. Note that English print sizes are multiples of 8% × 11
inches, and metric print sizes are multiples of the A4 size of 297 × 210
millimeters, allowing all prints to be folded to a common size.

Table 3-1 Print Sizes
The Lines of Manufacturing Prints
Several different types of lines are used to make prints, each with its own
purpose; see Figure 3-1. Object lines indicate the visible edges of parts, while
hidden lines indicate edges that are hidden behind the object. Dimensions,
annotations, and notes are applied using their own specialpurpose lines.

Figure 3-1 The lines of prints

Object Lines
Object lines are medium, solid lines used for all lines on the drawing
representing visible edges on the object, shown in Figure 3-2. Object lines are
also called “outlines” or “visible lines.”
Figure 3-2 Each type of line has a specific purpose.

Hidden Lines
Hidden lines are thin, evenly spaced dashed lines used to show object edges that
are not visible.

Center Lines
Center lines are alternate long/short dashes and are used to show the axes of
rotation for axisymmetric objects.

Symmetry Lines
Symmetry lines are center lines with the addition of a pair of short thick
continuous lines at each end, used to show the center of symmetrical objects.

Extension Lines
Extension lines are thin, solid lines extending out from the object lines or center
lines. They begin with a short, visible gap from the object line of the part and
extend perpendicular to their associated dimension line.
Extension lines may also be referred to as “witness lines” when they connect
two collin-ear object lines to provide clarity that they are in fact collinear. They
begin and end with short, visible gaps from the object lines of the part they
connect; see Figure 3-3.
Extension lines may also be referred to as intersection lines when they are
used to show points or intersections; see Figure 3-3. Intersecting extension lines
extend slightly beyond their point of intersection.
Figure 3-3 Various extension lines

Dimension Lines
Dimension lines are thin, solid lines indicating the dimensions of the object.
They connect extension lines and usually terminate in arrowheads, although
other terminations are also used. Dimension lines may be broken to allow space
for the dimension and tolerance, or they may underline the dimension and
tolerance, depending on the drafting standard used.

Leader Lines
Leader lines are thin, solid lines indicating a point or region on the part to which
a number, note, or other reference applies. Leader lines terminate with an
arrowhead when terminating on an object line or with a dot when terminating
within the boundary of an object. Leader lines are generally drawn at an angle.

Break Lines
Break lines are thin, solid lines indicating a break in the view or a partial section
view. Some objects have disproportionate dimensions, making them difficult to
place on the print at an appropriate scale. It is then necessary to “break” them to
present a reasonable level of detail. As Figure 3-4 shows, there are three types of
breaks commonly used:
 S-breaks: For round objects
 Z-breaks: For thin, long, wide objects
 Freehand breaks: For long, rectangular objects

Cutting Plane Lines
Cutting plane lines are thick and consist of a long dash and two short dashes in a
repeating pattern. Sometimes it is easier to visualize a part if it is drawn as
though it was cut and a part of the object removed. A cutting plane line is used
for this purpose. The cutting plane line indicates an imaginary cut, shown in
Figure 3-5. The cut surface is shown in a separate view that is called a section
view.
Figure 3-4 Break lines indicate an imaginary break on a print.

Figure 3-5 A cutting plane line

Section Lines
Section lines are also referred to as “crosshatching” and consist of a series of
thin lines filling a region on the object, used to identify the cut surface in a
section view as in Figure 3-5. Crosshatching usually consists of a set of solid
parallel lines at a 45-degree angle; however, section lines may consist of lines at
other angles and in other patterns. If more than one component is sectioned,
different crosshatching patterns are used for each part to provide clarity.

Phantom Lines
Phantom lines are thin and consist of a long dash and two short dashes in a
repeating pattern; see Figure 3-6. Phantom lines are used to indicate alternate
positions of moving parts, repeated details, and material on a part before
machining.
Figure 3-6 Phantom lines indicate an alternative position or repeated
details.

Priority of Lines
When the arrangement of the view places more than one line on top of each
other, some lines will not be visible. The following order of priority ensures that
the drawings are still readable:
 Object lines take precedence over other line types.
 Hidden lines take precedence over cutting plane lines, center lines, and
phantom lines.
 Cutting plane lines take precedence over center lines and phantom lines.
 Center lines take precedence over phantom lines.
Lettering
Lettering on prints is generally all uppercase (capital letters), and numbers are
Arabic numerals. The lettering and numerals are arranged for a horizontal
reading position as much as practical. When lettering cannot be read from the
bottom of the print, it is arranged to be read from the right.
With older hand-drawn prints (including scanned copies), legible lettering
may be a challenge. With modern CAD prints, this is no longer an issue.
Print lettering will be in several sizes of one font, depending on the purpose:
 Large (typically .24 inch or 6 millimeters): Part number and print size in title
blocks, section labels, and view labels
 Medium (typically .12 inch or 3 millimeters): Part name; revision in title
blocks, dimensions, tolerances, and notes; print border text; view scales; bills
of materials; and other tables
 Small (typically .096 inch or 2.4 millimeters): Title block headings
The Print Arrangement
A typical print has a border on all sides, a title block in the lower right-hand
corner, and a revision history block in the upper right-hand corner. A typical
print also has a manufacturing drawing of one part or one assembly, as you can
see in Figure 3-7. Some prints may have different locations for the title block
and revision history block, or they may not include them. Prints often contain
notes located near the title block or within the drawing.

Figure 3-7 Parts and arrangement of a typical print
Prints of all sizes have borders. Print borders may include centering marks
located at the middle of each frame side to facilitate folding or positioning of the
print to reproduce or scan.
Borders typically use a grid reference system (zones) to allow easy reference
to locations on the print for details notes, revision marks, etc.; see Figure 3-8.
Reference to a grid location may appear as in Figure 3-9.
Prints may consist of more than one sheet.

Figure 3-8 Print border and grid system
Figure 3-9 Reference to grid location
Drawing Views
The most important part of the print is the drawing. The drawing may consist of
one view or several views. Perspective is not used on manufacturing prints;
views are orthographic projections. Shading and artistry are not used on

manufacturing prints either; they are technical drawings.
Axonometric views (e.g., isometric, dimetric, trimetric) may be included if
they are helpful to clarify the part being illustrated; see Figure 3-13. Prints
contain only the minimum number of views required to show all manufacturing
specifications. Views are selected to show all detail with the fewest number of
views. Hidden lines may be absent from views if they do not provide additional
clarity.
The drawing views are annotated with many dimensions, tolerances,
symbols, and notes. The majority of this book is dedicated to their successful
interpretation:
 Views are interpreted according to Chapter 4.
 Dimensions are interpreted according to Chapter 5.
 Numeric tolerances are interpreted according to Chapter 6.
 Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is interpreted according to Chapter 7.
 Surface finish symbols are interpreted according to Chapter 8.
 Screw thread representations and notes are interpreted according to Chapter 9.
 Symbols and notes used to communicate special manufacturing requirements
that are
not directly illustrated and dimensioned are interpreted according to Chapter
10.
 Symbols and notes unique to castings, forgings, and molded part prints are
interpreted according to Chapter 11.
 Symbols and notes unique to welded part prints and sheet metal prints are
interpreted according to Chapter 12.
 Symbols and notes unique to gears, splines, and cams are interpreted according
to Chapter 13.
 Some other common types of prints are illustrated in Chapter 14.
Scale
The scale of a drawing is the relationship between the size of the drawing and
the size of the actual part. If the drawing is the same physical size as the actual
part, the drawing is called “full size”; see Figure 3-10. If it is not practical to
make a drawing the same size as the part, the drawing is made smaller or larger.
The drawing is, therefore, scaled down or scaled up from the actual part.

Figure 3-10 A drawing at full size
Figure 3-11 shows a full-size drawing of a 1-inch cube and two scaled-down
drawings. The drawing marked “half size” measures % inch on paper and is
dimensioned 1.000 on the drawing. If a drawing is referred to as “one-half
scale,” the drawing is one-half the size of the actual part.
Figure 3-12 shows a full-size drawing of a 6-millimeter pyramid and two
scaled-up drawings. The drawing marked “twice size” measures 12 millimeters
on paper and is dimensioned 6 millimeters on the drawing. If a drawing is
referred to as “twice scale,” the drawing is twice the size of the actual part.
The scale of a drawing may be any ratio, but the most common ones are 1:1,
1:2, 1:5, 1:10, etc. Scale may be shown in several different ways, such as FULL,
1 = 1, 1:1, 1/1, or some other similar form.
Although many prints are made with all views drawn at the same scale,
prints may also contain views drawn at different scales. Scale is indicated on the

title block and applies to all views in the drawing unless otherwise indicated.
Figure 3-11 Drawings of a 1-inch cube at various scales
Figure 3-12 Drawings of a 6-millimeter pyramid at various scales
Some prints may show an axonometric view at actual size; see Figure 3-13.
The view makes it easier to visualize the size of the actual part. The groove in
Figure 3-14 has been shown in a detail view at a larger scale to make it easier to
read. The scale for the view is indicated next to the view.

Figure 3-13 A scaled-up print may show a full-size supplementary
drawing.
A line under a dimension indicates the dimension is not to scale; see Figure
3-15. The line may be straight, or it may be wavy. As a rule, prints should never
be scaled or measured to find a dimension; some are even marked with a note
“DO NOT SCALE.” Scaling prints may lead to serious problems for several
reasons. The drawing may not be drawn to the correct scale, or the dimension
may have been changed. This is less of a concern with CAD-generated drawings
than with hand-drawn prints where a complete redraw due to a small design
change was labor-intensive and could be skipped. Regardless of how the print
was generated, the paper may stretch or shrink.

Figure 3-14 Some drawings may have more than one scale.

Figure 3-15 Dimension not to scale
Language on Prints
Prints may include English or non-English notes. Modern prints are made with
the intent of maximizing readability by anyone within a global audience. The
language used is likely to consist of concise statements using the simplest words
and phrases for conveying the intended meaning.
Certain words and phrases are frequently used on a print, such as:
 “PER,” “CONFORMING TO,” “AS SPECIFIED IN,” and “IN
ACCORDANCE WITH” (or “IAW”) indicate that another document or
standard is included in the requirements specified by the print, by reference.
 “UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED” (or “UOS”) indicates a default
requirement. The phrase is found at the beginning of a note and indicates that
the default is a generally applied requirement and the exception can be
clarified by providing a reference to another document or requirement on the
print.

 “SHALL” indicates a mandatory requirement.
 “WILL” indicates a declaration of purpose on the part of the design activity.
 “SHOULD” indicates a recommended practice.
 “MAY” indicates an allowed practice.
Symbols
As a general rule, drafting symbols are used instead of text notes for the sake of
international readability. Symbols in common use are illustrated throughout this
text along with their prior practices and meaning. Reading a print requires
understanding the symbols currently in use as well as prior practices that may
still be encountered.
Notes on Prints
Notes on a print are numbered, located near the title block, and identified with
the heading “NOTES.” They apply to either a portion of the print or the entire
print, providing additional treatment, finish, processing, or other considerations.
When it is necessary for a note to be associated with a specific area of the print,
that note’s identifying number is flagged and placed in the associated view, with
a leader if appropriate. Several varieties of note flags are common in practice;
see Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-16 Location-specific note flags
Title Block
A title block contains general as well as specific information. The format of the
title block and the information contained vary from company to company, but it
generally contains:
 Company name or name and address.
 Part name.
 Part number.
 Revision. The revision designation is always the letter or number of the latest

change.
The part number and revision together are needed to uniquely identify the
print.
 Approvals and release. This will include the names, signatures, or initials of
the person who created the print, checked the print, and approved the print.
Also, the date the print was created may appear here.
 Scale. This will include the scale of all views unless otherwise indicated.
 Material and material treatment.
 Surface treatment and coatings.
 Sheet number and total number of sheets.
 Default tolerances.
Typical title blocks used in industry are shown in Figure 3-17. An example
of a completed title block is shown in Figure 3-18. On multi-sheet prints, title
blocks for secondary sheets (sheet 2 and beyond) are simplified versions of the
title block for sheet 1.
Figure 3-17 Typical title blocks used in industry

Figure 3-18 A typical completed title block
Other information that may also be found on some title blocks include:
 Relevant standard(s)
 Projection symbol
 Default broken edges symbol or note
 Stock size
 Weight
 CAD model reference
Revision History Block
Once a print is “issued” or “released,” it is available to all other users besides the
engineering department. Prints can still be changed (revised) after they are
issued. Some of the reasons are to correct errors, to improve the product, to meet
different customer requirements, or to reduce costs. A revision may be a change,
a deletion, or an addition. A revision may be made to a dimension, to a note, or
to any other item on the print.
It is very important that print revisions are dealt with properly. This means:
 Revisions are recorded on the print in a revision history block, and the revision
level of the print is updated.
 Revisions to the drawing, dimensions, or tolerances are indicated by labeling
the change(s) on the print using location-specific note flags. Revision flags are
usually circular, though some prints may use other shapes.
 Out-of-date revisions of the print are voided.
Figure 3-19 shows a print with three typical revisions. Figure 3-19 is the
same as Figure 3-14 except for the revisions. Revision A changed the .312
dimension from .375. The revision consists of the dimension change, the
addition of the letter A within a circle, and the information within the revision
history block. The flag in this example, the revision letter within a circle, is
located near the change. Revision B changed the groove radius from .015 to
.062. Revision C changed the material from 1020 steel to 8322 brass.
The revision may include an engineering change order number or some other
reference number. Some systems require many approvals that are part of the
process. Figure 3-20 shows several typical revision history blocks that are used

in industry.
Bills of Materials
An assembly print contains a drawing showing more than one part. The bill of
materials (BOM) lists all required parts belonging to an assembly. This list
contains:
 Part numbers
 Part names
 Quantities of all parts
BOMs may also contain additional information, such as materials, suppliers,
and additional remarks. Depending on what standards are followed, a bill of
materials may contain a “find number,” a unique sequential identifier for the
items. Such find numbers are referenced on the drawing using callouts to
indicate which parts are which. For bills of materials that do not use find
numbers, the assembly drawing indicates the item numbers directly.
Figure 3-19 A print with three typical revisions

Figure 3-20 Typical revision history blocks
A BOM may be contained in its own separate document, or it may be created
on the assembly print. An example of a bill of materials appearing on an
assembly print is shown in Figure 3-21.
Parts are typically although not always listed in order of:
 Parts produced in-house
 Specialty-purpose parts (e.g., roller bearings)
 Standard purchased hardware (e.g., washers)
 Bulk items (e.g., lubricants)

Introduction
There are several different types of views that are used to illustrate different
aspects of parts on prints, and there is a specific way in which the views are
arranged to make up the drawing. A detailed examination of views and their
arrangement will make print reading much easier.

The Basic Views of Prints
All orthographic views on a print are projected from each other. The number of
views depends on the shape and complexity of the part. A print must contain as
many views as necessary to illustrate the part, without unnecessary or redundant
views. Complex parts require more views than simple parts. Some parts may
also require additional views such as section views. Views are selected to display
all the geometric details of the part using as few views as necessary.
One view on a drawing is usually referred to as the “front view,” “primary
view,” “principal view,” “base view,” or even “main view.” The terms “front,”
“top,” “right,” etc., do not have any meaning other than to relate the relative
viewpoints to one another using words. The front view on a drawing might show
the part in a position normally referred to as the “top” in its assembled position.

Drawings with One View
Two adjacent orthographic views are normally the minimum required to
illustrate a part. Some parts can be fully illustrated with only one view when the
third dimension is specified by a note, as in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1 Some parts require only one view.

Drawings with Two Views
Some parts need two views to be fully illustrated; see Figure 4-2. Additional
views are only present if they are required to illustrate detail.
Figure 4-2 Some parts require two views.

Drawings with Three Views
Many drawings use three views arranged in an orthographic relationship, as in
Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3 Some parts require three views.

More Than Three Views
Some parts require more than three views to be fully illustrated.

Auxiliary Views
Auxiliary views are used in orthographic projections to show the true shape of
features that are not aligned to the drawing’s standard up-down and left-right
projection directions. Objects that have features on slanted surfaces may be
difficult to visualize without auxiliary views. Auxiliary views conform to all
normal rules of orthographic projection, but their projected direction is whatever
direction is needed to illustrate the part; see Figure 4-4.
Auxiliary views may also be partial views. Partial views are connected to the
principal view by a center line or continuous thin line; see Figure 4-5.


Figure 4-4 Partial auxiliary view 
Figure 4-5 Partial auxiliary view Partial Views
Either the primary views or the auxiliary views of a part may show only a
portion of the part, where pertinent information or features are located; see
Figure 4-6. These partial views may be used where complete views would not
improve the information given. The partial view is cut off by a continuous, thin,
freehand line.

Figure 4-6 Partial views Removed Orthographic Views
Views may also be positioned in locations other than those dictated by strict
projection rules. On the parent view from which the removed view was based,
the presence of a removed view is indicated either by a section line or by a
single-letter view label and arrow showing the direction of viewing relative to
the parent view. The removed view itself is labeled with the same letter(s). The
word “VIEW” may be shown with the view label. If the removed view is found
on a different sheet from that of its parent, references will be included. If the
removed view is shown at a different scale from that of the parent view, its scale
is also indicated.
The use of reference arrows permits the various views to be freely
positioned. See Figure 4-7.

Figure 4-7 Removed orthographic views Rotated Orthographic Views

Reference arrows may also be used to indicate the placement of a view that has
been rotated from the orientation it would normally appear in if projection rules
were strictly followed. This may be necessary when the normal projected view
would not fit on the print.
The presence of a rotated view is indicated similar to the way a removed
view is. The rotated view itself is also identified similar to the way a removed
view is identified. In addition, a rotated view includes a rotation directional
symbol or note as well as the angle the view was rotated; see Figure 4-8.

Figure 4-8 Rotated orthographic views Detail Views
A small partial view shown at an increased scale from the rest of the drawing is a
detail view. Detail views allow small features to be shown more clearly and with
their required dimensions and tolerances.
The presence of a detail view is indicated using one of the notations shown
in Figure 4-9. The detail view itself is labeled with the same letter(s) and scale.
The word “DETAIL” may be shown with the view label. If the detail view is
found on a different sheet from that of its parent, references will be included.
Figure 4-9 Detail views Views of Symmetrical Parts
Symmetry lines indicate that the view provided shows only a portion of the part.

This is less common with CAD prints, where view creation is done
automatically, but it is still used to save print space. See Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10 Views of symmetrical parts Interrupted Views
Long parts may be drawn with break lines where the removed portions lack
detail that is needed for print interpretation. The limits of the parts retained are
shown as for partial views, and the portions appear close to each other. See
Figure 4-11.

Figure 4-11 Interrupted views Simplified Representation of Repetitive
Features Simplified views of parts with repetitive features may be shown
as in Figure 4-12. The number and detail of repetitive features removed
should be fully defined by dimensioning and tolerancing.
Figure 4-12 Simplified representation of repetitive features Section Views
Sometimes it is not practical to illustrate a part with basic or auxiliary views,
especially when parts are complex. In these cases, section views, also called
“sectional views” or “cross-section views,” are added. Section views are drawn
as though the object were cut and a portion of the part removed; see Figure 4-13.
This type of drawing is very effective and much easier to visualize than a
conventional drawing for some parts. The imaginary cut and removal can be
made along any line and can include any portion of an object.
A section view is created by making an imaginary cut along the part as in
Figure 4-14. The cut is shown as a cutting plane line. The right half of the part is
treated as though it were removed. The left half of the part is turned at right
angles and viewed with the arrows; see Section A-A in Figure 4-14. The exposed
cut surface is crosshatched to aid visualization.

Figure 4-13 A parent view with a cutting plane line and associated
section view 
Figure 4-14 A full section view Cutting Plane

On the parent view from which the section view was based, the presence of a
section view is indicated by a cutting plane line with arrows at each end
indicating the direction of viewing. A single-letter section view label is placed
next to each arrow. Two different standards in widespread use are shown in
Figure 4-15.
The section view itself is labeled with the same label. The word “SECTION”
may be shown with the view label repeated, as in “SECTION A-A.” Section
views are typically shown in their proper projected position on the drawing,
unless that is not practical. If the section view is found on a different sheet from
that of its parent, references will be included. If the section view is shown at a
different scale from that of the parent view, its scale is also indicated.
Figure 4-15 Cutting plane Hatching of Sections
Hatching is generally used to show areas of sections. The simplest form of

hatching is used— continuous, thin, single lines usually at 45 degrees.
Exceptions are made when the object lines are at or close to 45 degrees. See
Figure 4-16.
Separate areas of a section or separate sections of the same component are
hatched in an identical manner. The hatching of adjacent components is done
with different line angles or spacings. Figure 4-17 shows the hatching of four
adjacent components.
Figure 4-16 Hatching of sections 
Figure 4-17 Hatching through different components Outline Hatching
If an area of a section view is rather large, hatching may be limited to a zone
around the outline of the object, as shown in Figure 4-18.

Figure 4-18 Outline hatching Hatching to Indicate Type of Materials
Sometimes different types of lines are shown as section lines for the
purpose of referencing different materials; see Figures 4-19 and 4-20.
Regardless of what types of lines are shown, the lines are not used as
the material specification; the type of material is always specified in a title
block or separate note.

Figure 4-19 Alternative hatching 
Figure 4-20 Hatching of different materials Lines Behind the Cutting
Plane
Object lines behind the cutting plane are generally shown on the section view,
but they may be selectively removed if that improves drawing clarity. Hidden
lines are not shown in section views; see Figure 4-21.

Figure 4-21 Lines behind the cutting plane No Cutting Plane Line
Cutting plane lines, labels, and section view labels may not appear on drawings
where the cutting plane location is obvious; see Figure 4-22.

Figure 4-22 No cutting plane line Half Sections
A half section is similar to a full section except only half of one view is cut and
removed; see Figure 4-23. The remaining half is shown as a basic view. Half
sections are commonly used for parts that are symmetrical.

Figure 4-23 A half section view Offset and Aligned Sections
An offset section has two or more cuts that are parallel to each other but offset;
see Figure 4-24. An aligned section has two or more cutting planes that intersect
but meet at an angle; see Figure 4-25. The section view is projected to a location
on the drawing from either of the angled cutting plane lines. The section view is
drawn as though the two cuts were rotated into one view.
Sections can also be cut through parts using a combination of offset and
aligned methods, as in Figure 4-26.

Figure 4-24 An offset section view with two cutting planes 

Figure 4-25 An aligned section view with two cutting planes 

Figure 4-26 An offset and aligned section in three planes Removed
Sections
A removed section is shown removed from the outline of the main drawing; see
Figure 4-27. When the cross-sectional shape is symmetrical, the removed section
may be drawn in line with the cutting plane, as shown in Figure 4-27, or it may
be drawn in a different location and connected to the main object with a line.
When removed, the section view may be placed:  Near to and connected
with the view by a center line; see Figure 4-27.
 Anywhere on the drawing and identified by label; see Figure 4-28.
A removed section may also be used to enlarge a portion of an object, as you
can see in Figure 4-29. This method is used when an area is too small to be
illustrated at the same scale as the rest of the object.

Figure 4-27 A removed section view 
Figure 4-28 Removed section views.

Figure 4-29 A removed section may be enlarged to show greater detail.

Revolved Sections
The appearance of a cross-section view superimposed on its parent view is a
revolved section and indicates a cross-sectional view of the part, the cutting
plane indicated by the cross-sectional view’s center line; see Figure 4-30.
Revolved section views are used for symmetrical cross sections. Revolved
section views may also be shown within a break, as in Figure 4-31.
Figure 4-30 Revolved section views 
Figure 4-31 Revolved section view with break lines Broken-Out Sections
A broken-out section view shows a portion of an object as a section view
contained within a parent view, as in Figure 4-32. The section view is limited by
a freehand break line and used when a full section or even half section is
unnecessary.

Figure 4-32 A broken-out section view General Rules for Views
There are several conventions used on all drawing views that should be reviewed
to aid in visualization and interpretation.

Simplified Detail
Object lines that would normally be visible may be omitted entirely if doing so
improves clarity. In Figure 4-33, the left view omits visible detail from the right
side of the part, in order to illustrate the detail on the left side without confusion.
The right view also omits detail from the left side of the part that would
normally be visible.

Aligned Features
If a part has nonsymmetrical features such as spokes, ribs, and webs, it is
common practice to align the features in the drawing view. This is done in both
regular views and section views. When features are aligned in section views, the
features so aligned are not shown in section, as shown in Figure 4-34. The
section view that is labeled “ALIGNED” has the lower spoke aligned or rotated
into the section view.
Figure 4-33 Simplified detail 
Figure 4-34 Asymmetrical features shown aligned Simplified
Representations
Parts made with intersecting features may be difficult to draw accurately by
hand, so intersections may be shown simplified. Figure 4-35 shows such a part
(A) realistically in an isometric view; (B) with its complex intersections ignored;

(C) with its complex intersections shown simplified; and (D) realistically in an
orthographic view. When three-dimensional CAD is used to create drawing
views, true representations are the result.
Simplified representations are also used in section views; see Figure 4-36.
Figure 4-35 Simplified representations.

Figure 4-36 Holes in cylindrical section views are only shown in the
section area.
Intersections, Smooth
The appearance of continuous or phantom thin lines, separated by small gaps
from the object lines, indicates a smooth edge between two faces; see Figure 4-
37. Smooth edges are found at the ends of fillets or rounded corners and occur
when faces of different geometric description intersect at a 0 degree angle.

Figure 4-37 Intersections, smooth Flats
A flat is a flat area on a round shaft. Flats are commonly drawn with two thin
diagonal lines across the surface appearing in plan view, as in Figure 4-38.
Figure 4-38 Flats Fillets, Rounds, and Runouts
A runout is an extension of a flat surface into a rounded surface; illustrated in
Figure 4-39. Runouts are generally found on castings and forgings. The shape of

a runout depends on the shape of the intersecting surfaces. Figure 4-40 shows the
appearance of other fillets, runouts, and rounds.
Figure 4-39 A runout is an extension of a flat surface into a round
surface.
Figure 4-40 Appearance of fillets, rounds, and runouts Threads
Threads are usually shown as a simplified representation; see Figure 4-41. Other
acceptable methods are schematic and detailed (true). More on thread
representation can be found in Chapter 9.

Figure 4-41 Threads General Rules for Section Views
Additional drawing conventions apply only to section views. Successful
visualization and interpretation of prints requires being familiar with these
additional rules.

Identification of Views
Some section views are identified, such as A-A in Figure 4-15. Other section
views may not be identified, such as in Figures 4-29 and 4-32.

Sectioning Ribs and Webs
Ribs, webs, spokes, and other thin elements are typically not shown sectioned
when cutting planes pass through their length. They are shown using object lines
instead, and not crosshatched; see Figure 4-42.
Figure 4-42 Sectioning ribs, spokes, and webs

Nonsectioned Parts
Section views are also used as assembly prints, as shown in Figure 4-43. When
the cutting plane lies along the axis of items such as shafts, bolts, nuts, pins, and
keys, the items are shown non-sectioned, as in Figure 4-43, item 1.
Figure 4-43 Nonsectioned parts Sectioning Thin Elements
Thin sections may be shown entirely black, as in Figure 4-43, item 2.

Introduction
Dimensions are the numeric values expressed graphically, augmenting the views
of the print to specify the complete, three-dimensional geometry of the part; see
Figure 5-1. Dimensions convey information about the intended size and shape of
the part. When combined with the information provided by the tolerances,
dimensions fully describe the geometric requirements of parts.

English prints are dimensioned in inches, which may be shown as fractions
or decimals. Metric prints are dimensioned in millimeters. Some prints use dual
dimensioning, where inch and millimeter dimensional equivalents are provided
for all dimensions and tolerances.
Dimensions are arranged according to need, or they may be arranged
according to one of several systems. In order to make a part from a print, all
dimensions must be used, no dimensions will be redundant (except reference
dimensions, when used), and no dimensions will be missing unless this
information is specified in associated documentation.
Figure 5-1 Dimensions describe geometry.
Fundamental Dimensioning Rules
Dimensioning and tolerancing define the engineering intent and conform to the
following:  Dimensions are placed on the view or section that most clearly
shows the corresponding features.
 Dimensions for size, form, and location of features are complete to give full
understanding of the characteristics of each feature. Neither scaling
(measuring the size of a feature directly from an engineering print) nor
assumption of a distance or size is permitted.
 Each necessary dimension of an end product is shown. No more dimensions
than those necessary for complete definition are given.
 Dimensions are arranged to provide the required information with optimum
readability.
 Dimensions are shown in true view and refer to visible object lines.
 A 90-degree angle is implied where center lines and object lines are shown on
prints at right angles and no angle is specified.
Symbols
Common symbols related to dimensions are illustrated in Table 5-1 along with
their prior practices and meaning.
Elements of Dimensions

The elements of dimensions include the dimension line, extension line,
dimension line termination, leader line, and dimension value itself. The various
elements of dimensioning are illustrated in Figure 5-2.

Dimension Lines
A dimension line shows the direction and extent of a dimension. It connects the
extension lines with terminations (typically arrowheads) and has a space for the
dimension value. Dimension values may appear above the dimension line or in
line with a broken dimension line. Shorter dimensions are arranged closer to the
object, longer dimensions farther away to minimize line crossing. See Figure 5-
3.
The dimension line of an angle is an arc drawn with its center at the
intersection of the extension lines. The arrowheads terminate at the extension
lines of the two sides of the angle. See Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-3 Shorter dimensions are closer to the part.

Figure 5-4 Dimensioning angles Extension Lines
Extension lines are used to indicate the extension of a surface or point to a
location away from the part outline. They begin after a small gap from the object
line and extend slightly beyond the respective dimension line. See Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-5 Extension lines Extension lines are shown perpendicular to
the feature being dimensioned. Where space is limited, they may also be
shown obliquely, but parallel to each other. See Figure 5-6.
Extension lines are also used to show points or intersections. See Figure 5-7.
Intersecting extension lines extend slightly beyond their point of intersection.

Figure 5-6 Extension lines with limited space 
Figure 5-7 Extension lines indicating intersections Dimension Line
Terminations

Dimension lines use distinct terminations, typically arrowheads that may be
filled or unfilled. Arrowhead terminations are shown within the limits of the
dimension line where space is available. Where space is limited, the arrowhead
termination may be shown outside the intended limits of the dimension line that
is extended for that purpose. A dot may be used where space is too small for an
arrowhead; see Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-8 Dimension line terminations Leader Lines
A leader is used to direct a dimension, note, or symbol to a point on the print and
terminates in an arrowhead. Leaders are straight lines leading from a dimension
value or an explanatory note to the feature on the print to which the note applies.
The note end of the leader terminates with a short horizontal line underneath or
next to the note or dimension. See Figure 5-9. A leader terminating in a dot
within the perimeter of a surface indicates that the leader refers to the surface.

Figure 5-9 Leader lines Limited Length or Area Indication
Dimensions, tolerances, and other processing notes associated with a surface of
the part usually apply to the entire feature indicated. In some cases it is
necessary to refer to a portion of a surface to specify a tolerance, surface
treatment, or other manufacturing process. When it is necessary to refer to a
limited area or length, the extent of the region may be indicated using a chain
line; see Figure 5-10. The chain line appears parallel to the surface so indicated
and offset a short distance from it. The length of the region may be dimensioned.
Where the area is shown on a plan view, the area is crosshatched with a chain
line boundary and dimensioned. See Figure 5-11.

Figure 5-10 Indicating a limited length 

Figure 5-11 Indicating a limited area Indication of Dimensions
Dimension values may be expressed as decimals of an inch, fractions of an inch,
or millimeters. Combinations of inches and feet are used less frequently on
manufacturing prints, but are common on architectural prints.

Identification of Linear Units
On prints where all dimensions are in millimeters or all dimensions are in inches,
the print will contain a general note or indication in the title block stating which
units are used.

Decimal Inch Dimensioning
The U.S. Customary linear unit commonly used on manufacturing prints is the
decimal inch. Decimals of an inch are named as follows:  .1, tenths  .01,
hundredths  .001, thousandths  .0001, ten-thousandths  .00001, hundred-
thousandths Decimal dimensions may be called by the number of digits to the
right of the decimal point. As an example, a dimension in tenths is called a one-
digit decimal. Most of the dimensions in industry are in thousandths, which are
three-digit decimals.
“Leading zeroes” before the decimal point for dimension values less than 1
inch are not shown. “Trailing zeroes” are often placed after the decimal point to
show a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal point; see Figure 5-
12.
Figure 5-12 Decimal inch dimensioning Millimeter Dimensioning

Metric prints use millimeters as the standard unit of measurement. Millimeters
are divided into tenths, hundredths, and thousandths, similar to decimals of an
inch. Inches can be converted to millimeters or millimeters converted to inches
by referring to a conversion chart, as in Table 5-2. The following formulas can
also be used:  1 inch = 25.4 millimeters  Inches x 25.4 = millimeters  1
millimeter = 0.03937 inches  Millimeters x 0.03937 = inches

For dimension values that are whole numbers, no decimal point is used. No
commas or spaces are used as “thousands” separators.
Leading zeroes before the decimal point for dimension values less than 1
millimeter are shown. Trailing zeroes are not used after the decimal point. See
Figure 5-13.

Figure 5-13 Millimeter dimensioning Decimal Point Symbol
Most prints use a period as the decimal point. Some prints use a decimal point
that is visually identical to a comma. The shape of the decimal point will be
consistent on all dimension values given throughout the print.

Fractional Inch
Dimensions may be shown as fractions of an inch, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16,
1/32, and 1/64. Fractions can be converted to decimals by dividing the numerator
by the denominator. As an example, 3/8 of an inch equals 3 divided by 8, which
equals .375 inch. A conversion chart like the one in Table 5-2 can also be used.

Angular Units
Angular dimensions in both the U.S. Customary system and the metric system
are expressed in degrees. Angular values are written in either one of two
conventions:  Degrees (°) and decimal parts of degrees (e.g., 36.87°)  Degrees
(°), arc-minutes ('), and arc-seconds (") (e.g., 53°7'48") There are 60 arc-seconds
in an arc-minute, and 60 arc-minutes in 1 degree. An angle expressed in degrees,
arc-minutes, and arc-seconds can be converted to decimal degrees.
Leading zeroes before the decimal point for angular dimension values less
than 1 degree are not shown. Trailing zeroes are not shown; see Figure 5-14.

Figure 5-14 Angles are measured in degrees.

Dimensional Values
Dimensional values are placed in such a way that they are not crossed or
separated by any other line on the print. Linear dimensional values are usually
placed horizontally and in the middle of their dimension lines; see Figure 5-15.
This one-direction method is easy to read because it does not require turning
the print. Some prints have all values in line with the dimension line; see Figure
5-16.
Values may be indicated so that they can be read from the bottom of the print
or by turning the print to the right, as shown in Figure 5-17.
Figure 5-15 Dimension values may be shown in different ways.

Figure 5-16 Dimension values aligned to the dimension line 
Figure 5-17 Dimensions readable from the bottom or right Dual
Dimensioning
Inch dimensions are sometimes shown on metric prints for ease of understanding
or conversion. Dimension values may be followed by the abbreviation “IN” or
the inch symbol ("). When millimeter dimension values are given on English
prints, the dimension values may be followed by the abbreviation “mm.”
Inches are shown above the dimension line, and the millimeter equivalent is

shown below the dimension line within brackets, as in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18 Dual dimensioning Application of Dimensions

Placement
Dimensions are placed outside the outline of a view for readability, as you can
see in Figure 5-19. In cases where extension lines would be too long, too
numerous, or too busy overlapping, dimensions may be found within the view;
see Figure 5-20.
Figure 5-19 Placement of dimensions outside the view 

Figure 5-20 Placement of dimensions within the view Reference
Dimensions
Reference dimensions are located within parentheses; see Figure 5-21. Reference
dimensions do not have tolerances and are not used to manufacture or inspect
parts. The purpose of reference dimensions is to provide additional information.
The reference dimensions in Figure 5-21 provide overall dimensions without
requiring additional calculations. This information will be helpful when ordering
raw material for the part. Prior practice did not show reference dimensions
within parentheses and instead used REF or REFERENCE after the dimension.

Figure 5-21 Reference dimensions Overall Dimensions
Overall dimensions may be given, as long as no feature is overdimensioned.
When the overall dimension is reference, intermediate dimensions are shown, as
in Figure 5-22. When the overall dimension is more important, it is dimensioned,
and one of the intermediate dimensions is either shown as reference or not
shown, as in Figure 5-23.
Figure 5-22 Overall dimensions 

Figure 5-23 Dimensions not shown Dimensions Not to Scale
When prints are made “to scale,” dimension values are in proportion to the
pictorial representation of objects in the view. When changes are made to part
models in CAD, print views and dimensions are updated automatically and
effortlessly, so there is little need for indicating dimensions not to scale on these
prints. On shop prints, field prints, hand-drawn and pre-CAD prints, or in other
cases where changes are made using hard copies, dimensions may be indicated
as being out of scale with the pictorial views. Dimensions appearing not to scale
are so indicated by a thick underline; see Figure 5-24.
Parts should always be made and inspected according to the dimension
values indicated, and not by scaling the views.

Figure 5-24 Dimensions not to scale X, Y, and Z Coordinate System
The parts described by prints are three-dimensional after they’re built. Most of
them are created using three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD)
software before being documented as two-dimensional prints. Their designers
need to think of them as three-dimensional, and the way they do this is by using
a coordinate system with an origin and one axis for each of the three dimensions.
These axes are typically called X, Y, and Z.
An axis can be defined as an imaginary line in a coordinate system that is
used for measuring distance or angles. Figure 5-25 shows a coordinate system
with the basic X, Y, and Z axes labeled.
Figure 5-26 shows the X, Y and Z axes as dimensions of an L-shaped cube.

Figure 5-25 The X, Y, and Z axes Note that each axis is always in the
same direction. The X axis is always on the horizontal plane. The Y axis
is always along the width of the part, and the Z axis is always along the
vertical plane. Thinking about the dimensions on a drawing in terms of
the X, Y, and Z axes may be extremely helpful for students who do not
have any print reading experience, especially for more complex
drawings.
Several dimensioning arrangements use X, Y, and Z axes labeled on the
drawing. The X, Y, Z concept is used by most automated manufacturing
equipment to indicate direction and location.


Figure 5-26 The X, Y, and Z axes as dimensions Arrangement of
Dimensions
The following examples of dimensioning methods can be used alone or in
combination to achieve a designer’s requirements.

Chain Dimensioning
Dimensions locate surfaces one after the other; see Figure 5-27. An overall
dimension may be given as reference.
Figure 5-27 Chain dimensioning Baseline Dimensioning
All dimensions in a baseline system originate from baselines that are
perpendicular to each other; see Figure 5-28. Baselines are surfaces or center
lines that are easy to locate on the actual part. Baselines may be identified and
labeled as X, Y, and Z, or they may be identified and labeled using some other
convention (e.g., lateral, longitudinal, vertical).

Figure 5-28 Baseline dimensioning Polar Coordinate Dimensioning
Features located with radial (or diametral) dimensions and angular dimensions
are said to be located using a polar coordinate system; see Figure 5-29.

Figure 5-29 Polar coordinate dimensioning Ordinate Dimensioning
Ordinate dimensions are sets of linear dimensions measuring distances relative
to a common origin. Ordinate dimensioning is similar to baseline dimensioning
but further simplifies the print by eliminating dimension lines and their
arrowheads. Dimensions are shown next to extension lines and originate from
baselines; see Figure 5-30. The baselines are indicated as the zero (0)
coordinates, origins, or datums.
Figure 5-30 Ordinate dimensioning Dimensioning from a Common
Feature
Various methods for dimensioning from a common feature are shown in Figures
5-31 and 5-32.

Figure 5-31 Dimensioning from a common feature 

Figure 5-32 Dimensioning from a common feature Tabulated Dimensions
Tabulated dimensioning is a coordinate dimensioning method that places all
dimension values in a table instead of on the print view(s). Where dimension
lines, extension lines, and leaders would excessively clutter the print, points and/
or features are labeled, and dimensions are tabulated. See Figures 5-33 and 5-34.

Figure 5-33 Tabulated dimensions Combined Dimensioning
Single dimensions, chain dimensioning, and dimensioning from a common
feature may be combined on a print, if necessary. See Figures 5-35 and 5-36.
It is possible to manufacture parts from any type of dimensioning
arrangement, with or without a system, on any type of machine shop or
production equipment. Some calculations, however, may be required on some
types of prints.

CAD Model Reference
It is not unusual for prints to be created without any dimensions indicated.
Instead, a note in or near the title block references a CAD model, as in Figure 5-
37.
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) machining centers can import CAD
models directly for use in generating tool paths. Additive manufacturing (AM)
technologies can also reference CAD models for building parts. Tolerances and
other processing requirements and notes may still appear on the print with the
view(s).
Figure 5-34 Tabulated dimensions 

Figure 5-35 Combined dimensioning 
Figure 5-36 Combined dimensioning 

Figure 5-37 CAD model reference Special Indications

Repeated Features and Dimensions
Repetitive dimensions are labeled with an “X.” The X in Figure 5-38 indicates
the number of holes, so the note calls for eight holes with diameters of .532 of an
inch. Alternatively, the PLS in Figure 5-39 means “number of places.” The
dimension .625R. 4 PLS indicates that the .625R. is located at four places or at
the four corners.
Figure 5-38 Repetitive dimensions Some repeated dimensions also may
be labeled as shown in Figure 5-40. Dimensions marked “TYP” or
“TYPICAL” also indicate a series of repeated dimensions or features.
This method may make it difficult to know exactly how many times the
dimension or feature is repeated.

Figure 5-39 Number of places 
Figure 5-40 Typical dimensions Equidistant Features
When equidistant features or uniformly arranged elements are found on a print,
dimensioning can be simplified. Figure 5-41 shows an example of linear
spacing, where “11 X 32” means that the dimension “32” is repeated eleven
times.
Angular spacing of features is dimensioned as shown in Figure 5-42.
Figure 5-41 Equidistant features 

Figure 5-42 Equidistant features Dimensioning Features
Some dimensioning methods are used frequently for common features and are
illustrated here for improved interpretation.

Diameters and Squares
Symbols may be found with dimensions to identify shapes and improve print
interpretation. Objects that are round or square are dimensioned as shown in
Figure 5-43. The applicable symbol precedes the value for the dimension
without any space between them.
The diameter symbol or DIA text precedes a diameter value and may appear
in the plan view, the longitudinal view, or a section view, as in Figure 5-43.
Outside diameters may be labeled “O.D.,” and inside diameters may be
marked “I.D.” after the dimension. Center lines through circular patterns of holes
are sometimes labeled “D.B.C.” for diameter bolt circle; see Figure 5-44.
Current practice is to use only the diameter symbol.

Figure 5-43 Dimensions for round and square features 
Figure 5-44 Prior practices for diameters Radii
A radius value may be preceded by the radius symbol “R.” Radii are sometimes
indicated with “R,” “RAD,” or “RADIUS” after the dimension value. A radius
dimension may have one extension line or none. When the dimension arrow
appears on the object line, there is no extension line; see Figure 5-45. When the
dimension arrow appears off the object line, the extension line is an arc of radius
equal to the object’s radius.

Figure 5-45 Dimensions for arcs and round corners When the center of a
radius is shown on the print, it is indicated with a center point, a small
cross. Extension lines and dimension lines may be used to locate the
center point of the radius. When a radius has a center point, the radius
dimension originates at the center point. When the arrowhead termination
is on the outside of the feature outline, it does not pass through the
center point. When the center point is not needed to locate the radius, the
location is indicated by other features such as tangent surfaces. See
Figure 5-46.
The center of large radii may be located far away or off the view and may be
foreshortened for readability. Foreshortened dimension lines to the center point
and a foreshortened radius dimension are shown in Figure 5-47.
Multiple radii may be indicated with a single radius dimension. The spherical
radius symbol “SR” before the dimension value indicates a spherical surface; see
Figure 5-48.

Figure 5-46 Radius center located and not located 
Figure 5-47 Foreshortened dimension line for large radius 

Figure 5-48 Spherical radius Chords, Arcs, and Angles
Chords, arcs, and angles are dimensioned as shown in Figure 5-49.

Figure 5-49 Chords, arcs, and angles Cones, Tapers, and Slopes
These features can be dimensioned by length, diameter, ratio, and angle in
various combinations, as in Figure 5-50.

Figure 5-50 Cones, tapers, and slopes Rounded Ends and Slotted Holes
Features with rounded ends may be dimensioned to physical surfaces or center
points. When the size of the radius can be derived from other dimensions, the
dimension value is usually omitted. See Figure 5-51.

Figure 5-51 Rounded ends and slotted holes Rounded Corners
Internal rounded corners (fillets) and external rounded corners (rounds) with
radii tangent to the adjoining surfaces do not show the centers dimensioned. See
Figure 5-52.

Figure 5-52 Fillets and rounds Outlines Consisting of Arcs
Contoured surfaces constructed from two or more arcs are dimensioned with a
combination of dimensions to centers and tangent surfaces. See Figure 5-53.

Figure 5-53 Outlines consisting of arcs Irregular Outlines
Complex or mathematically defined contours may be dimensioned as shown in
Figure 5-54. When a large number of points are needed to provide the necessary
precision, points may be tabulated instead of dimensioned.
When the number of points is too large for a table, reference may be made to
an underlying CAD model. See Figure 5-37.

Figure 5-54 Irregular outlines Chamfers
A chamfer is a removal of a small amount of material from an edge. Chamfers
are found at the ends of shafts, at the openings of holes, or at the edges of
surfaces; see Figure 5-55. Threads generally have chamfered ends. Chamfers
remove sharp edges, making it easier to assemble parts.
Chamfers are dimensioned with a note and leader line indicating the size and
angle of the chamfer; see Figure 5-56. When the exact dimensions are not
obvious, a linear dimension and an angular dimension are provided, or two linear
dimensions are provided.
When the edge of a round hole is chamfered, the diameter is indicated as in
Figure 5-56.

Figure 5-55 A chamfer is a beveled edge.

Figure 5-56 Chamfers may be dimensioned in several ways.

Round Holes
Round holes are dimensioned as shown in Figure 5-57. The note “THRU”
appearing after the hole diameter is used to indicate that the hole extends
through the part; this note is used when the views do not clearly show this.
Blind holes have their depth indicated with the depth symbol, with the word
“DEEP” or abbreviation “DP,” or with a view and dimensions, as seen in Figure
5-57. The depth refers to the depth of the full diameter of the blind hole from the
outer surface.
Figure 5-57 Round holes Counterbored Holes
A counterbored hole has two diameters with a step or flat surface between the
diameters. The larger diameter generally provides a recess for the head of a
socket head cap screw. Counterbored holes are also used to assemble other parts
such as bearings.
Counterbored holes have both hole diameters indicated, with the counterbore
diameter indicated using the counterbore symbol before the diameter value or
using the note “C’BORE” or “COUNTERBORE” after the diameter value. The
depth is indicated with the depth symbol, the DP note, or a view and dimensions.
Prior dimensioning practice, current dimensioning practice, and the resulting
dimensions of a counterbored hole feature are shown in Figure 5-58.

Countersunk
A countersunk hole has a tapered or beveled opening that is machined with a
countersinking tool. Countersunk holes are generally used to seat flat head
machine screws. Countersinking tools are also used to remove burrs from round
holes. Prior dimensioning practice, current dimensioning practice, and the
resulting dimensions of a countersunk hole feature are shown in Figure 5-58.
Figure 5-58 Holes showing prior practice, current practice, and resulting
dimensions Counterdrilled
A counterdrilled hole has two diameters with a tapered surface between the
diameters. The tapered surface is generally used as a seat for a flat head machine
screw. A counterdrilled hole is made by drilling two holes of different diameters.
The larger drill must have a specific taper at the end. Countersunk and
counterdrilled holes have both hole diameters indicated, as well as the included
angle and depth. The depth refers to the depth of the full diameter of the
counterdrill from the outer surface. Prior dimensioning practice, current
dimensioning practice, and the resulting dimensions of a counterdrilled hole
feature are shown in Figure 5-58.
Chamfered and Countersunk Holes on Curved Surfaces When a
hole breaking through a round surface is countersunk, the hole
appears elongated on the drawing. The diameter indicates the minor

diameter, as shown in Figure 5-59.
Figure 5-59 Chamfered and countersunk holes on curved surfaces
Spotfaces
A spotfaced hole has a center hole plus a larger spotfaced diameter. The larger,
machined diameter is always rather shallow. It is only deep enough to provide a
smooth and flat surface for assembly purposes; see Figure 5-60. Sometimes the
depth is not specified on prints. When no depth is given, the intended spotface is
only as deep as necessary to produce a fully flat machined surface. Spotfaced
holes are generally found on castings that have rough surfaces. A spotfacing tool
is used for machining the hole.
Spotfaces are dimensioned by their diameter and sometimes depth, which
may be indicated as a depth or by the remaining thickness of material to the far
side. If no depth is indicated, the spotface is the minimum depth required to
clean up the surface to the specified diameter.

Figure 5-60 Spotface Machining Centers
Machining centers usually consist of a shallow blind hole plus a large
countersunk hole and are dimensioned as in Figure 5-61.
Figure 5-61 Machining centers Keyseats and Keyways
Keyseats and keyways are dimensioned by width, depth, location, and length.
The depth may be dimensioned from the opposite side of the hole or shaft; see
Figure 5-62.
Figure 5-62 Keyseat and keyway Flat
A flat is a flat surface on a round shaft; see Figure 5-63. The flat may be at the
end of the shaft or somewhere along the shaft. A flat is generally used as a seat
for a set screw, which holds a part, such as a gear, onto the shaft.

A pair of opposed flats or multiple pairs may be used for fitting a wrench and
may be accompanied by the note “AF” for “across flats” or “SW” indicating
“spanner wrench size.”
Figure 5-63 A flat is a flat area on a round shaft.

Neck or Undercut
A neck is a groove or undercut between two diameters, as Figure 5-64 shows;
these diameters may be threaded or smooth. Necks are used when a flush fit is
necessary; the neck eliminates a radius between the diameter and the shoulder
that may interfere with a flush fit.
Figure 5-64 A neck is a groove between two diameters.

Boss
A boss is a circular raised surface that is generally found on a casting or forging;
see Figure 5-65. It may or may not have a hole in the center. A boss provides a
flat and smooth surface for assembly of other parts.
Figure 5-65 A boss is a circular raised surface. A pad is an elongated
raised surface.

Pad
A pad is an elongated raised surface similar to a boss; see Figure 5-65. A pad
may or may not have a hole or slot. The purpose of a pad is the same as that of a
boss: it provides a flat and smooth surface for the assembly of other parts.

Surface Coating Dimensioning
Some surface treatments (e.g., paint, chrome plating) have a thickness that will
change the measurement results depending on whether the measurement is made
before or after the surface treatment is applied.
A dimension applied to a surface affected by treatment (coating or plating) is
understood to be as measured after treatment. If not, it is accompanied by a
“Dimension before coating” note. A coating thickness and its tolerance will be
specified in the title block, written as a note, or referenced in an associated
document to assist in preparing the part for its surface treatment; see Figure 5-
66.

Chapter 5 Worksheets
The first worksheet in Chapter 5, 5-0 is an example of a typical worksheet
except it has answers and calculations. It also has several worksheet guides.
Each question, calculation, answer and guide should be carefully reviewed in
order to form a basic understanding of future worksheets. Time spent on
thoroughly understanding each item will make future questions easier to answer.
The next four worksheets are similar to 5-0 and provide the basis for future
worksheets.
Some of the Chapter 5 worksheets include isometric drawings to help
visualization. A review of the relationship between the isometric and the
orthographic drawing will help improve visualization. Most of the worksheets in
subsequent chapters do not have isometric drawings.
The first worksheet has dimensions with fractions because students without
previous experience generally find fractions easier to understand. Most of the
remaining worksheets have decimal dimensions. Calculations with decimals are
easier to make especially when using a calculator. Industrial prints generally
only use decimal dimensions and all industrial equipment and measuring
instruments are calibrated in decimals.

5. 1-3/4 Dimension 1 + 3/4
When writing out dimensions to be calculated, start from the left

method reduces the chances of omitting a dimension. It also
makes checking and classroom reviews much easier to follow
and understand.
6. 3 Dimension 1 + 3/4 + 1-1/4
Only use dimensions that are shown on the print to calculate
dimension. Do not use calculated dimensions to calculate
other dimensions. As an example: do not use 5 to calculate 6.
If an error was made in calculating 5, it would also make 6
incorrect.
14. 1020 Steel Material
When answering questions such as material or finish, answer the
question exactly as it is shown on the print.
As an example: the answer to question 14 is 1020 Steel.

Introduction
All parts are manufactured with variation from their exact, intended size and
shape. Tolerances specify exactly how much variation is allowed for the part to
be acceptable. Tolerances are necessary because it is not possible to manufacture
parts without variation. Tolerances are selected based on several factors such as
the end use of the part, the cost, the way it is manufactured, and experience. This

chapter illustrates how tolerances for linear and angular dimensions are applied
to prints and how their meaning is interpreted.
Tolerancing and Related Principles
Tolerances may be expressed:  Implicitly—as a general tolerance applied to all
dimensions unless otherwise specified. Implicit tolerances are given in the title
block or in a supplemental document or CAD file referenced from the print.
 Explicitly—as direct limits or tolerance values applied directly to a dimension.
 As a geometric tolerance that may be associated with one or more basic
dimensions.
These various methods of expressing tolerances are illustrated in Figure 6-1.
Implicit Tolerances
Implicit tolerance means that no tolerance is shown with the dimension because
it is stated either elsewhere on the print or in a document or CAD file referenced
from the print. Dimensions that are not basic have implicit tolerances. However,
some prints may include a note indicating that all untoleranced dimensions are
basic, as in Figure 6-2.
Almost all industrial prints have a title block that contains a set of tolerances,
as in Figure 6-3. These tolerances are called “general tolerances,” “title block
tolerances,” or just “block tolerances.” They apply to all dimensions that do not
have a direct tolerance or a geometric tolerance and are not covered by a
separate note.
Figure 6-1 Print with tolerances expressed using various methods 

Figure 6-2 Print with “ALL UNTOLERANCED DIMENSIONS ARE
BASIC” note General tolerances are usually broad and are not intended
for critical dimensions. General tolerances may be different for different
companies and industries. A common method for specifying general
tolerances on English prints links the tolerance to the number of decimal
places displayed in the dimension, as in Figure 6-3.
Figure 6-3 Inch title block with tolerances by decimal places General
tolerances for millimeter prints link the tolerance to the dimension value,
as in Table 6-1, since the number of decimal places displayed is
irrelevant. ISO 2768 may be referenced, or the relevant information may
be repeated on a print. Figure 6-4 shows the title block for a print with
ISO 2768 “Medium” tolerances applied as the default unless otherwise

specified.
Figure 6-4 Metric title block with ISO 2768-m tolerance used Some angle
tolerances are implied when their dimensions are also implied and do not
appear on the print:  An angle of 0, 90, or 180 degrees is implied where
center lines or surfaces are shown on orthographic views as parallel or at
right angles to one another. The tolerance on the implied angle is found
on the title block.
 A basic angle of 0, 90, or 180 degrees is implied where center lines or surfaces
are shown on orthographic views as parallel or at right angles to one another
and geometric tolerances are applied.

Explicit Tolerances
An explicit tolerance means that a tolerance value is shown with the dimension.
There are several ways in which explicit tolerances are expressed. No matter
how the tolerance is displayed on the print, the maximum allowable value can be
calculated as the dimension plus the plus tolerance, and the minimum allowable
value can be calculated as the dimension minus the minus tolerance.

Equal Bilateral
The dimension is given first and followed by the “plus-or-minus” (±) symbol
and then the tolerance value; see Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5 Equal bilateral (±) tolerances Unequal Bilateral
The dimension is given first, followed by the tolerance displayed on two rows:
(1) the top with a plus followed by the plus tolerance value and (2) the bottom
with a minus followed by the minus tolerance value; see Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-6 Unequal bilateral tolerances Unilateral
The dimension is given first, followed by the tolerance displayed on two rows.
Unilateral toler-ancing is similar to unequal bilateral tolerancing, but with either
the plus tolerance or the minus tolerance value equal to zero; see Figure 6-7.
Unilateral tolerancing with a positive tolerance is referred to as “oversized”;
unilateral tol-erancing with a negative tolerance is referred to as “undersized.”

Figure 6-7 Unilateral tolerances Unequally Disposed
The dimension is given first, followed by the tolerance displayed on two rows.
Unequally disposed tolerancing is similar to unequal bilateral tolerancing and
unilateral tolerancing, but with two positive tolerance values or two negative
tolerance values. See Figure 6-8.
Unequally disposed tolerancing with positive tolerance values is referred to
as “oversized”; unequally disposed tolerancing with negative tolerance values is
referred to as “undersized.”
Figure 6-8 Unequally disposed tolerances Limit Dimensioning
Tolerances may be shown as maximum and minimum dimensions and are called
limits; see Figure 6-9. Limits display a permissible range in the form of direct
dimensions that do not require additional calculations. Limits are generally
expressed with the larger dimension above the smaller dimension; however,
limits for internal dimensions may have the smaller dimension above the larger
dimension, as shown in Figure 6-9.

Figure 6-9 Limit dimensioning for internal and external features Single
Limits
A MIN or MAX after a dimension indicates the minimum or maximum value
permitted, with no limitation on the other limit. Single limits are used where the
unspecified limit can be zero or approach infinity and the feature will still satisfy
the design intent. The radius in Figure 6-10 cannot be larger than .125. It could
be produced smaller, even zero for a sharp corner. The .500-diameter hole in
Figure 6-11 must be at least .750 deep. The hole can be deeper, even be
produced as a through hole.

Figure 6-10 Single limits Tolerance Expression
Tolerances are displayed on prints following different conventions, based on
whether the dimensions are in inches or millimeters; see Figure 6-11.

Inch Linear Dimensions
Tolerances for inch linear dimensions are given in inches.
Figure 6-11 Expression of tolerances  On bilateral, unequally disposed,
and limit tolerances, both the plus and minus values have the same
number of decimal places as the dimension.
 On unilateral tolerances, either the plus or minus value is zero; a plus or minus
sign is used followed by the decimal point, and the same number of zeroes is

shown in the tolerance as digits in the dimension.
 On basic dimensions, trailing zeroes are not used.

Millimeter Linear Dimensions
Tolerances for millimeter linear dimensions are given in millimeters.
 On bilateral, unequally disposed, and limit tolerances, both the plus and minus
values have the same number of decimal places, with trailing zeroes added if
necessary.
 On unilateral tolerances, either the plus or minus value is zero; a single zero is
shown without a plus or minus sign.
 On basic dimensions, trailing zeroes are not used.

Angular Dimensions
Tolerances for angular dimensions are given either in decimal degrees or in
degrees, minutes, and seconds to match the units of the dimension. The
respective units are given for both the dimension and the tolerance; see Figure 6-
11.
For angle dimensions, both the plus and minus values have the same number
of decimal places, with trailing zeroes added if necessary.

Limits of Size
Unless otherwise specified, the limits of size given to a feature describe the
amount of geometric form variation, as well as size variation, that is allowed.
More information on the types of variation is given in Chapter 7.
Symbolic Tolerances
Tolerances may be indicated using the nominal dimension and symbol
representing the tolerance. Symbolic tolerances are defined in ANSI B4.2-1978
(R1994). Symbolic tolerances are a type of explicit tolerance and may be
bilateral, unilateral, or unequally disposed. Figure 6-12 shows three methods of
applying symbolic tolerances to inch linear dimensions and millimeter linear
dimensions.
In each example in Figure 6-12, the nominal size is 1.1250 inches of 30
millimeters. In example (a), limit dimensioning is used with a reference to the
symbolic equivalent. In example (b), the symbolic tolerance is given and
dimensional limits provided for reference. In example (c), only the symbolic
tolerance is given. A key may be given on the drawing, such as Figure 6-13. If
no key is provided, the reader will need to reference fit tables, such as Table 6-3
or Table 6-4, to find the tolerance values. Note that the key gives the English
tolerance values in thousandths of an inch and metric tolerance values in
micrometers (thousandths of a millimeter), or mm, which is typical of symbolic
tolerance value tables.
Figure 6-12 Methods of applying a symbolic tolerance 

Figure 6-13 Symbolic tolerance keys Common Fits
Symbolic tolerances are typically used on features that fit onto another feature
on a mating part. Both parts are designed with the same nominal dimension and
the appropriate tolerance to give the pair the proper fit. Table 6-2 summarizes the
symbols and the fit description for the most common fits.

Numerical Values for Common Fits Tolerance grades, or limits of
size, are graduated based on the dimension, with larger tolerance
ranges given to larger dimensions. Standard ANSI tolerance grades
and their numerical values are shown in Table 6-3 for English prints
and Table 6-4 for metric prints. The tolerances are expressed in
upper and lower deviations where the upper deviation is always
placed above the lower, regardless of whether they are for internal
or external dimensions.
Tolerance Applications
Understanding how to read the various methods used to specify tolerances
implicitly and explicitly on prints and understanding how to calculate the limits
on dimensions are necessary skills for reading prints. Equally necessary is
developing an understanding of how to interpret the allowable manufacturing

limits for features in specific applications. Several specific applications follow.

Tolerance Accumulation
How dimensions and tolerances are applied to a print has a profound impact on
the amount of variation allowed to the part’s features. Three methods of
dimensioning and tolerancing the same part are displayed in Figure 6-14.
 Chain dimensioning: Greatest tolerance accumulation between surfaces X and
Y
 Baseline dimensioning: Less tolerance accumulation between surfaces X and
Y
 Direct dimensioning: Least tolerance accumulation between surfaces X and Y

and direct dimensioning (bottom)

* Note: Values are given in џт. 1 mm = 1000 цт.

Angular Surfaces
Angular surfaces may be indicated by:  Two linear dimensions and tolerances 
Three linear dimensions and tolerances  One linear dimension and tolerance,
plus one angular dimension and tolerance Angular surfaces indicated on prints
with a directly toleranced linear dimension and angular dimension, as in Figure
6-15, must be produced within a tolerance zone represented by two nonparallel
planes. See Figure 6-16.
With tapers and slopes, the tolerance is applied to the first number of the
ratio; see Figure 6-17.
Figure 6-15 Angle tolerances 

Figure 6-16 Tolerancing an angular surface with a linear and angular
tolerance 
Figure 6-17 Tolerance of a taper feature Conical Tapers
Conical tapers include standard machine tapers as described by ASME B5.10
and may be indicated by taper name and number; see Figure 6-18. Taper name is
inches per foot.
Conical tapers may also by indicated by:  Two diameter dimensions and
tolerances, plus a linear dimension and tolerance, as in Figure 6-19
 One diameter and tolerance, a taper dimension and tolerance, and a linear
dimension and tolerance 

Figure 6-18 Standard taper 
Figure 6.19 Taper tolerancing Radius
A directly toleranced radius dimension indicates that the part surface must lie
between two arcs drawn at the maximum and minimum radii; see Figure 6-20.
A controlled radius symbol, “CR,” indicates that the part surface must not
have any reversals in its contour.
Figure 6-20 Radius and controlled radius Geometric Tolerances
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) is a standardized language
used to communicate manufacturing tolerances on prints. GD&T uses symbols
to specify exact limits on variation. As a general rule, GD&T is applied
according to ASME Y14.5-2009 (revision of ASME Y14.5M-1994). Figure 6-21
shows a typical print using GD&T.

Types of Variation
The parts described on two-dimensional manufacturing prints are three-
dimensional objects. Features on three-dimensional objects have up to four
different types of variation from their “ideal” design:  Size  Location 
Orientation  Form Geometric Versus Size Tolerances GD&T does not replace
conventional forms of tolerances; rather it supplements them. Conventional, or
“plus-or-minus,” tolerances are effective at describing limits on allowable
variation for sizes, but when they are applied to locate features or to orient
features, there is often ambiguity. GD&T eliminates this ambiguity. Furthermore,
the shapes (forms) of surfaces are not controlled by conventional tolerancing.
Figure 6-21 Print using GD&T
The print in Figure 6-22 is completely defined with plus-or-minus (±)
dimensions. Using the ± dimensions for the size of the hole and the thickness of
the plate is a clear and acceptable method for defining these features. The
remaining ± dimensions on the part are not clear and are subject to
misinterpretations.

Figure 6-22 Print without GD&T
Verifying that the actual produced part meets the print requirements becomes
difficult. Surfaces on the part are not flat, perpendicular, or parallel, so how do
we make measurements from them? Do we measure from the high points, low

points, median points, or locally wherever it’s convenient? The hole is out of
location and not perpendicular to the faces. All the features have angles to each
other within a tolerance of ±1 degree in the plane of the drawing, but what about
in a plane perpendicular to the drawing?
Some of the surfaces do not oppose each other. If we attempt to check the
2.250 dimension by measuring from the long surface to the short surface, we
will get a different answer than if we measure from the short surface to the long
surface.
The part has plus-or-minus two-dimensional-type tolerancing. In order to
have quality parts, a clear three-dimensional mathematical definition of the part
is needed. Tolerances that apply to the locations of features, to their orientation,
and to their form in three dimensions are referred to as “geometric tolerances,”
and they are the subject of Chapter 7.
Statistical Tolerancing
Statistical process control (SPC) is a quality control method used in
manufacturing to ensure a good manufacturing process by sampling inspection
results. Statistical models are used to calculate tolerance stacks and assign
tolerances to the dimensions of features.
When statistical process control is used, manufacturing tolerances can
become larger in order to reduce manufacturing costs. Specific dimensions and
tolerances that will be controlled through SPC may be indicated on the print
using an identifying symbol and title block note as shown in Figure 6-23.
Prints will need to refer to an associated document or company standard
defining the exact methods of sampling and related SPC tools that will be used
to monitor production.

Introduction
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), which you first read about in
Chapter 6, is a system of specifying tolerances to control the form, location, and

orientation of features. GD&T is a combination of symbols and characters that
supplements numeric dimensions and tolerances; see Figure 7-1. Both numeric
tolerances and geometric tolerances are used on the same drawing. GD&T
provides a clear and concise standard for illustrating tolerances. The symbols are
simple and easy to understand and have an exact meaning defined by industry
standard. The system provides a precise method of specifying tolerances on
industrial prints. Since GD&T is an accepted standard that is used throughout the
manufacturing world, the symbols have the same meaning in any language. The
purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the system as it pertains
to basic print reading. A complete description can be obtained from Standard
ASME Y14.5, Dimensioning and Tolerancing.
Figure 7-1 Geometric dimensioning supplements conventional
dimensioning.

The part in Figure 7-2 was originally drawn using only the ± tolerances in
Chapter 6. Using a combination of geometric and ± (numeric) tolerances, it has
been redrawn to eliminate the difficulties in using only numeric tolerances. Now
the origin and direction of all measurements are clear based on the print. The
exact amount of variation allowed on the form, orientation, and location of each
flat surface is explicitly stated on the print. The allowable variation in all three
dimensions for each feature has been described.
Symbols
Common symbols related to GD&T are illustrated in Table 7-1 along with their
meaning.

Basic Dimensions
Dimensions appearing as in Figure 7-3 are basic dimensions. Basic dimensions
appear in conjunction with geometric tolerances. Basic dimensions have no
tolerances, and they describe the intended geometry of the part. Basic
dimensions appearing on the print do not indicate that the part must be made
perfect; that is impossible. They only indicate that the tolerance that describes
the allowable variation is found elsewhere, such as in a feature control frame.
Basic dimensions describe the dimensions that are found in the CAD model.
They describe the perfect size, shape, and location that are intended, not the
imperfect geometry that is allowed.
Figure 7-3 Basic dimensions Features
Parts are made up of features, which can be divided into two classes: features
that have size and surfaces; see Figure 7-4. Successfully interpreting prints with
GD&T requires you to think about your parts in terms of their features, not only
in terms of the dimensions appearing on the print.
Features that have size have a directly dimensioned size tolerance, which
may be placed explicitly next to the dimension or implicitly on a title block or

symbolic key; see Chapter 6. The maximum and minimum limits of size are
given special names in the geometric system, which are helpful for
understanding bonus tolerance:  Maximum material condition (MMC): The
maximum size limit for an external feature or the minimum size limit for an
internal future. In either case, whatever limit, if produced, results in the part
having the maximum amount of material allowed.
 Least material condition (LMC): The minimum size limit for an external
feature or the maximum size limit for an internal future. In either case,
whatever limit, if produced, results in the part having the least amount of
material allowed.
The terms “MMC” and “LMC” are useful for calculating clearances between
mating parts; see Figure 7-5.
A fundamental rule of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is that a size
dimension controls not only the size of the feature, but also its form. Any feature
with size that is produced at its MMC is only acceptable if its form is perfect.
The size of the pin in Figure 7-6 is allowed to vary from 15.98 to 16. Variation
from perfect form is only allowed to the extent that the size varies from MMC.
Some form variation is allowed (bow, necking, barreling, out-of-round, etc.), but
only variation that does not push the material of the pin beyond its 16-millimeter
cylindrical boundary.
Figure 7-4 Features with size and surfaces 

Figure 7-5 Clearance between mating parts 

Figure 7-6 Perfect form at MMC required Feature Control Frames
Geometric tolerancing is a three-dimensional (3D) language. The geometric
tolerance creates a zone of tolerance within which the feature must lie. Tolerance
zones come in a variety of shapes depending on the control applied and the
feature. Tolerance zones can be three-dimensional or two-dimensional. Two-

dimensional (2D) tolerance zones are used when geometric control is more
important in one direction than another. They apply to a cross-sectional element
of a feature, such as straightness applied to a pin’s surface. Straightness is
measured in one direction only, lengthwise; not around the pin, which is never
intended to be straight.
The rectangular box is called a feature control frame and indicates a
geometric tolerance. The proper way to read a feature control frame is shown in
Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7 The proper way to read a feature control frame A feature

control frame consists of a series of symbols and numbers. From left to
right: 1. The geometric characteristic symbol: This symbol indicates what
type of geometric tolerance applies; see Table 7-2.
2. The shape of the tolerance zone (optional): The shape will be identified by
one of the following: square symbol, diameter symbol, spherical diameter
(rarely), or blank. When no symbol is given, the shape of the tolerance zone
is inferred from the shape of the feature.
3. The total size of the tolerance zone: This is always given in the same linear
dimension units used on the rest of the print—inches or millimeters.
4. The material modifier symbol (optional): The symbol will be one of these
three: the MMC symbol, the LMC symbol, or the RFS symbol (prior
practice). For MMC, bonus tolerance is available on an MMC basis; and for
LMC, bonus tolerance is available on an LMC basis. If no symbol is given or
if the RFS symbol is used, there is no bonus tolerance allowed.
5. The datum reference frame (mandatory for some geometric characteristics,
excluded for some, optional for some): This will be one or more datum
references listed in order of precedence (primary, secondary, etc.).
Bonus Tolerance
In some cases, the geometric tolerance given in a feature control frame can
actually be made larger during inspection, allowing more variation than the print
would seem to indicate. This tolerance is sometimes referred to as “bonus
tolerance,” because it is added to the geometric tolerance in the feature control
frame to get the total tolerance used to verify the feature. Bonus tolerance may
be indicated on the print for a size feature, never for a surface.

Bonus tolerance is indicated in one of two ways, on a maximum material
condition (MMC) basis or on a least material condition (LMC) basis. The basis
for the bonus tolerance is indicated by the symbol in the feature control frame
after the geometric tolerance; see Table 7-1. With the MMC modifier, the
geometric tolerance given on the drawing applies when the size of the feature
actually produced is its maximum material condition; for a feature produced at
any other size, there is bonus tolerance. The RFS symbol after the geometric
tolerance, or no symbol, indicates there is no bonus tolerance for the feature.
The calculation involves only two numbers: the actual produced size of the
feature and either its MMC or LMC. The MMC or LMC can be calculated from
the dimension and tolerance on the print; the actual produced size of the feature
is measured at inspection. Only one calculation is used, depending on whether
the feature is internal or external and on what modifier is used; see Table 7-3.
Table 7-3 Calculating Bonus Tolerance and Total Tolerance for Features 
Total Tolerance = Tolerance from feature Control Frame + Bonus
Tolerance at MMC
An example of a feature allowing bonus tolerance is shown in Figure 7-8. The
through hole’s size is given as limits, with 12-12.5 allowable. The

perpendicularity requirement of the hole relative to datum A is given by the
feature control frame. The tolerance of 0.2 applies only in the case when the hole
is produced at its maximum material condition of 12 millimeters. For a hole of
any other size, bonus tolerance is available. The amount of bonus tolerance, and
therefore the total tolerance on perpendicularity, depends on the actual produced
size of the hole. Table 7-4 illustrates the bonus tolerance calculation and the total
tolerance on the perpendicularity of the feature for various possible hole sizes
that might be produced. The table does not show all possible hole sizes, only
sizes in 0.1-millimeter increments. For any other size the calculation is used.

Tolerance at LMC
With the LMC modifier, the geometric tolerance given on the drawing applies
when the size of the feature actually produced is its least material condition; for
a feature produced at any other size, there is bonus tolerance.
An example of a feature allowing bonus tolerance is shown in Figure 7-9.
The through hole’s size is given by the size tolerance, and a feature control

frame indicates the position requirement of the hole relative to datums A and B;
see Figure 7-10. The position tolerance of .006 applies only in the case when the
hole is produced at its least material condition of 1.502 inches. For a hole of any
other size, bonus tolerance is available; see the calculation in Table 7-5.
Figure 7-9 An example of a position symbol used and a tolerance with
LMC

Figure 7-10 A description of a hole at LMC and its location Form Controls
Form controls limit the variation a feature is allowed to have from its perfect
shape, or form. Form controls do not specify the size of features or any other
type of variation. Because the size tolerance controls the form of a size feature, a
geometric form control applied to a size feature tightens the form control.
In the geometric system, there are four tools for controlling form:
straightness, flatness, circularity, and cylindricity. Examples of their indication
and interpretation are shown, respectively, in Figures 7-11, 7-12, 7-13, and 7-14.

Datums
One of the most important features of the geometric system is the concept of
datums. A datum is a perfectly flat surface or perfectly straight axis represented
by the physical inspection equipment. A datum serves as the origin of all
measurements in the geometric system and provides the way to locate and orient
the part in its inspection setup.
Datums are derived from the features on the actual produced part, called
“datum features.” Datum features are indicated on the print using the datum
feature identifier; see Figure 7-15.

Figure 7-15 Example terms and symbols Datums are the geometric
counterpart to their datum features. A feature intended to be a flat plane
means the corresponding datum is a plane. A round feature such as a
shaft used as a datum feature results in a datum axis. Figure 7-16 shows
several examples of flat features used for datum planes. Figure 7-17
shows several round features used for datum axes.
Usually several datums are indicated on a print, as seen in Figure 7-18. The
design intent of the part is that datum features D, E, and F are all flat surfaces
perpendicular to each other, so datums D, E, and F are flat surfaces
perpendicular to each other. Datums are needed any time there is a need to
specify the relationship of one feature with respect to another. In Figure 7-18, it
is important to locate the two holes relative to the datum features D, E, and F.
Datums are not referenced for size tolerances or form controls, but they are
needed for most other geometric controls.

Figure 7-16 Datum symbols indicating planes 
Figure 7-17 Datum symbols indicating axes 

Figure 7-18 Datum features and datums in use Orientation Controls
Orientation controls limit the tilt of features and are always associated with basic
angle dimensions. For parallel and perpendicular angles, these angular
dimensions often do not actually appear on the print since they are usually
implied. Because they control the relationship between features, orientation
feature control frames always reference at least one datum.
Orientation controls are used for features of size and surfaces. When applied
to surfaces, they also control the form. They do not control the location of
features. When applied to features of size, the center plane or axis of the feature
is controlled, and bonus tolerance is available.
Orientation controls provide full 3D control, but they can be made 2D by the
note “LINE ELEMENTS” appearing beneath the feature control frame.
In the geometric system, there are three tools for controlling the orientation
of features: parallelism, perpendicularity, and angularity. Examples of their
indication and interpretation are shown in Figures 7-19, 7-20, 7-21, and 7-22.

Location Controls
There are three geometric controls to locate size features. The indication and

interpretation of the position control will be demonstrated, first by comparison to
conventional means of using ± dimensions to locate features.
Conventional Tolerancing
The location of a hole using conventional tol-erancing is shown in Figure 7-23.
The location of a hole using position tolerancing and MMC is shown in Figure
7-24. The basic data are the same as in Figure 7-23. A description of the hole and
its location is shown in Figure 7-25.

Figure 7-23 The location of a hole using conventional tolerancing 

Figure 7-24 The location of a hole using position tolerancing One
difference between the tolerancing methods is the 1.500 dimensions
locating the hole. The other is the presence of a feature control frame in

the geometric system.
In the conventional system, Figure 7-23, the 1.500 dimensions locating the
center lines of the hole have tolerances of plus or minus .004 inch. The center
lines and tolerances form a .008 square, as shown in the enlarged drawing; the
.008 square is called the tolerance zone. The center lines of the actual holes must
be within the square to be within tolerance. Recall from the section on datums
that the exact origins of the 1.500 dimensions are unclear. Since the outer
surfaces of the part are not perfectly flat or perpendicular to each other, this
square may actually be a parallelogram.
Figure 7-25 The proper way to read a position tolerance The geometric
system shows the 1.500 dimensions within a rectangle, which means
they are basic dimensions. A basic dimension tells us the intended
perfect location of the hole axis measured from the datum. Basic
dimensions do not have tolerances; they do not tell us what variation is
allowed, only the hole that is desired. The exact amount and type of
variation that are acceptable are established from the feature control
frame.
The other difference is the feature control frame used to establish a round

tolerance zone. The difference between a square tolerance zone and round
tolerance zone is illustrated in Figure 7-26. A hole produced within the shaded
region of the circle but outside the white region of the square would function
properly but get rejected during inspection following the conventional method.
The .008 square has a diagonal dimension of .011 that becomes the .011
diameter for the geometric method. The .011 diameter increases the tolerance
zone by 57%. The geometric system also allows bonus tolerance when that
meets the functional requirements.


Figure 7-26 Tolerance zone comparison
Position
The position control is applied only to features having size, and it limits both
location and orientation variation. Position is used for both round features like
holes and square or rectangular features like keyseats.
For a round hole, the axis of the hole is controlled in all three dimensions
with a cylindrical-shaped tolerance zone extending the full depth of the hole.
The position tolerance requires the axis of the hole to be within the tolerance
zone through its full depth. This has an impact on both the location and tilt (i.e.,
orientation, or attitude) of the hole. For a rectangular keyseat, the center plane of
the keyseat width is controlled in all three dimensions with a tolerance zone
whose shape is the space between two parallel planes. This has the impact of
controlling the location of the keyseat on its shaft axis, the tilt of the keyseat
lengthwise, and the tilt of the keyseat depthwise.
Figure 7-27 An example of position used on slotted hole Two examples
of position indication and interpretation are shown in Figure 7-24 and
Figure 7-27.
Concentricity and Symmetry
Concentricity and symmetry are two more geometric controls that can be used to
control the location of features that have size. They are, however, much less
flexible than position in how they are applied.
Concentricity can be used to locate round features drawn concentric to a
datum axis. Symmetry can be used to locate square and rectangular features

drawn symmetric to a datum center plane. Bonus tolerances are not used.
Examples of their indication and interpretation are shown in Figures 7-28 and 7-
29.
Figure 7-28 An example of concentricity 

Figure 7-29 An example of symmetry Profile Controls
Profile controls are applied only to surfaces and limit all types of variation:
location, orientation, and form. They can be used for simple flat, inclined, and
curved surfaces as well as more complex 3D surfaces. The shape of the tolerance
zone follows the basic shape of the surface(s) controlled and is equally disposed
bilaterally by default. In most cases profile feature control frames reference at
least one datum, usually more.
In the geometric system, there are two profile controls: profile of a surface
and profile of a line. Profile of a surface is a full 3D control, and profile of a line

is a 2D control applied only at individual cross sections. Examples of their
indication and interpretation are shown in Figures 7-30 and 7-31.

Figure 7-30 An example of the profile of a line control 
Figure 7-31 An example of the profile of a surface Runout Controls
Runout controls limit the amount of form, orientation, and location variation
relative to an axis. The runout controls apply to the total indicator movement
when an indicator is placed on the surface and the part is rotated around its axis.
Prior practice was to indicate runout control on prints using a note specifying a
tolerance value and either TIM (for “total indicator movement”) or FIM (for
“full indicator movement”).
In the geometric system, there are two tools for controlling the runout of
features: circular runout and total runout. Total runout is a full 3D control, and
circular runout is a 2D control applied only at individual cross sections. On a
turned surface, total runout controls taper and straightness; circular runout does
not.

Introduction
Surface finish refers to the physical texture of a surface produced by machine
cutting tools or other fabrication techniques such as molding or casting. The
surface finish of a part is created by normal machining processes and sometimes
additional mechanical surface processing (such as polishing), heat treatments, or
chemical treatments.
Surface texture or finish refers to the degree of smoothness, or roughness, on
any surface of a part. There are many reasons for specifying and controlling
surface texture. The way some parts function is primarily determined by their
finish. A ball bearing must have smooth surfaces to reduce friction. An
automobile must have an engine block with smooth cylinder walls to run
efficiently. The handles on a pair of pliers must be rough on the outside, so they
will not slip in your hand.
The surface finish of a machine part can be just as important as its material

properties. A surface’s geometric and material properties can significantly affect
friction, wear, fatigue, corrosion, and electrical and thermal conductivity. Surface
texture affects appearance, friction, lubrication, sealing, wear, and many other
characteristics. Not only does a surface have a particular shape, roughness, and
appearance, but it can also have a layer with properties that differ significantly
from those of the bulk material. This is because a machined surface is the result
of fracture after an intense shearing process. Measuring and describing surface
features and their characteristics are among the most important aspects of
machine tool design.
Texture Characteristics
Figure 8-1 shows an enlarged section view of a typical machined surface. Many
machined surfaces appear to be smooth, but when magnified, they are similar to
Figure 8-1. The detailed contours of a surface can be split into three main
components: roughness, waviness, and form. Additional characteristics of
surface texture include lay, skewness, and flaws, as illustrated in Figure 8-2. For
most applications, roughness is the only characteristic that is specified on prints.
Figure 8-1 An enlarged section view of a typical machined surface
Roughness
Roughness refers to small scale, closely spaced irregularities caused by the
cutting process. Marks produced by cutting tools during machining operations
are examples of roughness; lines of this type are commonly called “tool marks.”
ISO standards define many ways that the roughness profile can be measured
and reported. The two most common surface roughness measurements are the
arithmetic mean value (Ra) and the root mean square (Rq). Each defines the
mean line or mean plane of a surface through different mathematical approaches.
Since different calculations are made, the two methods sometimes arrive at

different conclusions. It is therefore important not to mix the two. The Ra
measurement can be found on most engineering prints; however, it does not
capture the full topography of the surface.
Since roughness only describes the average roughness or gives maximum or
minimum roughness peak heights, the same roughness measurement can occur
for very different surfaces. Figure 8-3 shows four surfaces with the same Ra
roughness values. Although all these surfaces have the same roughness value,
they will each react quite differently in rolling or sliding situations. For critical
applications, specifying surface roughness without also defining waviness and
skewness is not adequate. Specifying only Ra or Rq is even less informative.
Figure 8-2 Roughness, waviness, lay, and flaw

Figure 8-3 Different surface textures with the same roughness average
Waviness
Waviness has a longer period than roughness and can be caused by any cyclic
characteristic of the machine-tool-toolholder combination.
Flexure of the workpiece or the tool system is also a cause of waviness.
Waviness is at its worst when a critical frequency is reached and chatter occurs.
Form
Form errors result from machine characteristics such as slideway variations and
from inaccurate tool settings. Form errors can also arise from thermal distortions
of the workpiece or the machine during cutting and also inadequate support of
the workpiece during cutting.
Other characteristics to describe surface texture are lay, skewness, and flaws.
These characteristics are specified for critical applications.
Lay
Cutting tools leave characteristic marks on the surface that may affect the way
the surface wears and interacts with mating parts. The general direction of the
tooling marks depends on the manufacturing method selected; the general
direction may be specified for applications where lay is critical.

Skewness
Skewness indicates the degree to which roughness comes from external variation
or internal variation. Figure 8-4 is an illustration of two surfaces with the same
Ra values but with different skewness. For a contact-bearing application, sharp
deep valleys separated by wide flat planes (negative skewness) would perform
better than sharp spikes (positive skewness), for the same overall roughness
value. A surface with positive skewness would contain spikes that would soon
wear off, creating wear debris and damage.
Figure 8-4 Skewness
Figure 8-5 Surface texture symbols

Flaws
Flaws are infrequent, random defects such as scratches or cracks.
Specification of Surface Texture
The surface texture symbol looks like a check mark. This symbol provides a
uniform and concise way of specifying surface texture. Use of this symbol has
been standardized by the American National Standards Institute in ANSI/ASME
46.1 and Y14.36. These standards are recognized and used throughout the world.
Figure 8-5 presents the basic symbol along with the location of the various
surface texture indications for specifying roughness, production method,
inspection length, and lay. When requirements other than those listed here are to
be designated over a surface (such as skewness or flaws), a separate note is
included.
Removal of Material Indication
The basic surface texture symbol occurs in three forms: “open”, “closed” with a
bar, or fitted with a circle to indicate whether the surface, respectively, may,
must, or must not be machined, as Figure 8-6 illustrates.
Figure 8-6 Removal of material indication
Roughness Height
The number specifying the roughness height is found in position “A” (see Figure
8-5). When alone, the number indicates the arithmetic average of the peaks and

valleys of the surface, and as such it is referred to as “Ra.” One number above
the symbol indicates the maximum roughness. Any surface smoother than the
one specified by the symbol is acceptable.
Surface texture for English prints is specified in microinches [millionths
(.000001) of an inch]. Surface texture for metric prints is specified in
micrometers [thousandths (0.001) of a millimeter]. Table 8-1 indicates standard
roughness values for English and metric prints. The values indicated are
approximately equivalent (63 microinches is approximately 1.6 micrometers).
Specifying only one maximum number on a print may lead to producing a
surface that is smoother than necessary at an added expense. Producing a surface
that is too smooth may also be a physical problem for some applications. Two
numbers, as in Figure 8-7, indicate a minimum and maximum roughness value.
If a different measurement technique from Ra is intended, the number must
be preceded by the appropriate symbol, such as “Rt” or “Rz,” and the symbol
and number are found in position “F”. Additional roughness height symbols are
found in Table 8-2.

Production Method
When a specific production method is needed, the basic symbol is augmented by
a horizontal line, and the specific production method appears in position “B”
(Figure 8-5), such as GRIND, MILL, POLISH, BUFF, etc.
Sampling Length
The sampling length may be specified in position “C” (Figure 8-5). When a
roughness height other than Ra is specified, it follows the sampling length after a
slash.
Lay
Lay direction is indicated in position “D” (Figure 8-5) using one of the lay
symbols in Table 8-3.
Roughness Width
A roughness width may also appear on the symbol in position “D,” specifying
the maximum allowable spacing between tool marks, as seen in Figure 8-2.
Machining Allowance
A number appearing in position “E” (Figure 8-5) indicates the amount of
material that must be removed (inches or millimeters).
Waviness
When waviness requirements are specified, the basic symbol is augmented by a
horizontal line, and the maximum allowable waviness height (peak to valley) is
indicated in position “F” (Figure 8-5). Waviness is given in the print’s linear
units (inches or millimeters), not the roughness value units (microinches or
micrometers).
Maximum allowable waviness width may also be indicated, in the print’s
linear units, following the height and a dash.
Examples
The surface texture symbol may be applied in many different ways, with and

without various additional specifications. Several examples of the symbol are
given in Table 8-4, with descriptions of their meaning, to help with
interpretation.
Symbol Application
Symbol Placement
Surface symbols are normally located so that they touch the object line for the
surface that requires the finish. If this is not practical, the symbol is placed on an
extension line. And if this is not practical, the symbol is used with a leader line,
as illustrated in Figure 8-8. Both the symbol and the inscriptions are oriented for
reading from the title block corner.

Partial Areas
Sometimes only part of an area or surface requires a specific texture. Areas that
require partial finishing may be identified as shown in Figure 8-9.
Substitute Symbol
Notes may be used to simplify the appearance of the surface texture symbol by
defining one or more substitute symbols, as in Figure 8-10.

Figure 8-9 Surface texture requirement applied to a portion of the
surface
Figure 8-10 Use of simplified substitute symbols
No Symbol
Not all machine parts require special surface textures. Many parts are used as
normally manufactured. If texture symbols are not shown, surfaces produced by
normal manufacturing methods are acceptable.
Prior Practice Symbols

Though no longer in common use, finish marks such as those in Figure 8-11 may
still be found on old prints. Because their interpretation is not precise, the
standard surface finish symbol is used now.
Another prior practice to specify Ra values on prints was the use of the
letters “RHR” with a superscript indicating the range of Ra value permitted. In
Figure 8-12, surface roughness average between 16 microinches and 32
microinches is acceptable.
Another prior method to specify waviness height and width uses the standard
surface texture symbol from Figure 8-5 with two numbers above the horizontal
line in position “B” separated by a dash, see Figure 8-13. These numbers
indicate maximum waviness height and width, in the print’s linear units (inches
or millimeters), not the roughness value units (microinches or micrometers).

Other Designations
Finish All Over
It is common to find prints specifying all surface finish requirements with a
general note “ALL SURFACES . . . UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE,”
“FINISH ALL OVER,” “FAO,” or a symbol placed in the title block that
indicates the same meaning.
Separate Note
A print may have a separate note similar to one of the following:
“ALL SURFACES MUST BE SMOOTH AND FREE OF FLAWS AND
DEFECTS,” “THERE SHALL BE NO PARTING LINES, BLOW HOLES,
INCLUSIONS, OR OTHER FLAWS,” “SURFACES MUST BE CLEAN AND
FREE OF BURRS.”
Surface Treatments
Prints may indicate additional surface requirements besides texture. Table 8-5
lists several common treatments applied to parts and specified on prints. Surface
treatments may be indicated on the title block as applying to all surfaces on the
part, or specific surfaces requiring treatment may be indicated by local note.
Surface Coatings
Most components receive some kind of coating before being put into use. These
coatings provide better corrosion protection, wear resistance, and lubrication
properties than the base metal. Many provide a nice-looking decorative finish.
Coatings may change the dimensions of the part through buildup on the surface,
which may be uneven. Dimensions and tolerances on the print apply after all
surface coatings are applied, unless a note indicates that dimensions apply before
coating. Table 8-6 lists common surface conversion treatments applied to

engineered parts.
A wide variety of surface coatings and treatments are available, many
marketed by brand names or company names. Although preferred practice is to
specify an industry standard, prints often contain references to company names
or brand names, which present challenges when companies change product
offerings or go out of business; see Figure 8-14.
Figure 8-14 Print specifying surface coating by brand name

Introduction
There are hundreds of applications for threads. One of the most common uses is
for machine bolts and other threaded fasteners. Threads are also used in
applications to adjust, clamp, control, measure, and move various items. Threads
are generally made of steel, but they can be made of other metals and plastics.
Some machine components have threads as an integral part of their design; spark
plugs and oil filters are examples of parts with built-in threads.
Several industry standards define thread profiles for specific purposes.
Although there are many different types of threads, most of the terms that are
used are universal. The purpose of this chapter is to review the terms that are
normally used with threads. The way threads are shown and identified on prints
will be examined. Five popular threads will be described: Unified, metric, Acme,
buttress, and pipe. Other types will be similar. Additional data on these threads
and information on other types of threads may be found in the standards
referenced below.

Thread Terminology
Threads are external or internal. External threads are also referred to as “male,”
internal as “female.” They may be right-handed or lefthanded, with right-handed
being the most common and the default. Right-handed threads follow the “right
to tighten, left to loosen” mantra. The basic thread form is shown in Figure 9-1
for external threads and Figure 9-2 for internal threads. The exact shape of the
thread (e.g., included angle, depth, and crest and root details) depends on which
standard thread form is being considered.
Figure 9-1 External thread terms 

Figure 9-2 Internal thread terms Thread Forms
There are several different thread forms commonly used in industry, with each
designed to meet a specific requirement. Unified and metric threads are V-
shaped and are used for most general applications such as fasteners. Acme
threads and buttress threads are used to transmit power, as in jacks for lifting
loads. Pipe threads are also V-shaped, but they are produced on a taper and are
designed to produce a seal between the threads of mating parts. Table 9-1 lists
common thread designations and their governing standards.

Unified Threads
The most widely used thread form is the Unified, conforming to ASME Standard
B1.1, Unified Inch Screw Threads. The standard is used around the world. The
thread form has a 60-degree included angle and flats at the top and bottom, as
shown in Figure 9-3. Unified threads are manufactured in several different ways,
such as cutting, rolling, or molding.

The Unified thread defines the thread size by the nominal outside (major)
diameter of an external thread and the number of threads per inch. The pitch is
the lengthwise distance between thread crests, and it is the reciprocal of threads
per inch. For example, a thread form with 20 threads per inch has a pitch of 1/20
of an inch, or .050 inch.
The Unified thread form has three different series of pitch: coarse (UNC),
fine (UNF), and extra fine (UNEF). Coarse threads are used for all general
applications. Fine threads are used if greater strength or vibration resistance is
required. The fine thread series has less thread depth than the coarse series. Extra
fine threads are generally used for thin-walled sections, tools, and instruments
and fine adjustments.
Sizes smaller than 1/4 inch are named by the numbers 0 through 12. Sizes
1/4 inch and larger are named by their actual size. The diameter is generally
expressed as a fraction; sometimes it is shown as a decimal if all other

dimensions on the drawing are decimals.
Table 9-2 lists additional information for UNC, UNF, and UNEF threads up
through 1 inch. The ASME Standard B1.1 contains additional information for
thread sizes up to 6 inches.
Metric Threads
Metric threads conform to ASME Standard B1.13M and are very similar to
Unified threads. They both have similar V-shaped, 60 degree profiles but use
different dimensions, and so they are not compatible.
The metric screw thread form is designated by the nominal outside (major)
diameter of an external thread and the pitch. Metric threads have a coarse-pitch
and a fine-pitch series. Coarse pitch is used for fasteners and all general
applications. Fine pitch is used if greater strength or vibration resistance is
required; fine pitch is also used for thin-walled sections, tools, instruments, and
fine adjustments.
Table 9-3 lists dimensions for metric threads up to 30 millimeters. The
standard contains additional data for thread sizes up to 355 millimeters.
Acme Threads
Acme threads are designed to transmit mechanical motion in either direction and
conform to ASME Standard B1.5. The profile of an Acme thread is shown in
Figure 9-4. The angle between adjacent threads is 29 degrees. The tooth
thickness at the pitch diameter is one-half the pitch. There are two classes:
general purpose, G, and centralizing, C. There is also a Stub Acme thread form
conforming to ASME Standard B1.8 whose thread depth is only 0.3P instead of
the typical 0.5P.

Table 9-4 lists dimensions for Acme threads up to 3 inches. The standard
contains additional data for larger thread sizes.
Figure 9-4 The profile of an Acme thread Buttress Threads
Buttress threads, similar to Acme threads, are used to transmit power. They are
different in that they are optimized to drive in one direction only, instead of both
—for example, in a vise that only needs to provide force in one direction.
Buttress threads conform to ASME B1.9, and their profile is shown in Figure 9-
5.
Buttress threads are designated by their major diameter and number of
threads per inch. There are two different types of buttress threads: pull (BUTT)
and push (PUSH-BUTT). Table 9-5 lists dimensions for buttress threads.

Taper Pipe Threads
The most widely used pipe thread is the American National Standard Taper Pipe
Thread, simply called the “national pipe thread.” It conforms to ASME Standard
B1.20.1 and is used on threaded pipes and pipe fittings. The thread has a taper of
3/4 inch per foot, which is equal to an angle of 1°47’24”; see Figure 9-6.
Standard taper threads require a sealant between mating threads to make a tight
seal.
National pipe taper threads are designated by the nominal pipe size of the
internal diameter of schedule 40 pipe into which external threads are cut.
Because of pipe wall thickness, the actual diameter of the threads is larger than
the nominal diameter. Table 9-6 lists dimensions for taper pipe threads.
Dryseal
Dryseal pipe threads are similar to standard taper pipe threads. They are
designed to seal without the aid of sealing compounds. To do this, the threads
have little clearance or a slight interference fit. The threads must be made to
close tolerances. Applications for dryseal threads include automotive, hydraulic,
and refrigeration systems. Dryseal threads conform to ASME Standard B1.20.3.
Table 9-6 also applies to dry-seal taper pipe threads.
Metric Pipe Threads
Metric pipe thread sizes have been adopted by the ISO (International Standards

Organization) and are intended to assemble pipes into ISO pipe ports on valves,
cylinders, pumps, and other components. They come in both straight and tapered
styles. Tapered threads seal at the thread connection between parts. An
appropriate thread sealant can be used, if necessary, to ensure pressure-tight
joints. Straight threads seal using a gasket, washer, or O-ring. Straight metric
pipe threads conform to ISO 22 8/1-G, which is identical to BSPP (British
Standard Pipe, Parallel) threads. Tapered threads conform to ISO 7/1-R, which is
identical to BSPT (British Standard Pipe, Tapered) threads.
Metric pipe threads are designated by the nominal pipe size in inches like
NPT threads. Since there is only one thread pitch, it is usually not specified.
External tapered threads (ISO 7/1) can be mated to either tapered or straight
internal threads. However, straight external threads do not make a tight fluid seal
on the threads and should not be used where a leak-tight joint is required.
Internal straight threads (ISO 228/1) can be mated to external straight
threads. If a fluid-tight seal is required, a sealing element must be used. Table 9-
7 lists dimensions for metric pipe threads.
Methods of Displaying Threads
Threads may be shown on prints in three different ways: simplified, schematic,
or detailed.

The simplified method is most common and uses object lines and hidden lines to
represent threads; see Figure 9-7. The schematic method resembles threads with
staggered lines drawn perpendicular to the thread axis representing the thread
roots and crests; see Figure 9-8. Detailed representation shows individual threads
as in Figure 9-9. Sometimes multiple methods of displaying threads will appear
on the same print, as in Figure 9-10.
Figure 9-7 Simplified representation of straight threads Tapered threads
are easily identified by their taper, which appears in the representation;
see Figure 9-11. It is common practice to show it at 3 degrees instead of
the actual angle. The 3-degree slant shows a taper that is easier to

recognize.
Both external and internal threads may be produced with partial incomplete
threads (vanish or runout), which is visible on the drawing. The extent (length or
depth) of a threaded feature always indicates the extent of the full thread form.
When necessary for design requirements, the extent of the incomplete form is
also indicated. See Figure 9-12.

Figure 9-9 Detailed representation of straight threads 

Figure 9-10 Multiple methods used 
Figure 9-11 Simplified representation of tapered threads 

Figure 9-12 Specifying thread extents Designations
General tolerances on prints do not apply to thread features. The exact size and
shape of thread forms including tolerances on included angles, diameters, root
radii, etc., are all contained within their respective ASME standards and are not
dimensioned in detail. Instead, the specific thread form specified is indicated on
the drawing as a note using a standard identifying notation.
For any thread identification found on a print, the relevant ASME standard
may appear after the normal thread identification to avoid misunderstanding.
Unified Threads
Typical Unified coarse threads are indicated on prints as in Figure 9-13, which
shows external threads, and Figure 9-14, which shows internal threads.
The identification for Unified threads consists of: 1. Nominal major
diameter: For numbered thread sizes, the major may appear on drawings in any
of several possible formats: 10, #10, No. 10, 10 (.190), #10 (.190), No. 10 (.190),
or .190. For thread sizes larger than 1/4 inch, the nominal major diameter is
typically given as a fraction, even on prints using decimal inch values for all
other dimensions. The nominal major diameter may also appear as a decimal
inch value.
The diameter is followed by a dash.
2. Number of threads per inch.
3. Thread series designation: One of UNC (Unified coarse), UNF (Unified
fine), or UNEF (Unified extra fine).
4. Tolerance class of fit (optional): The fit refers to the looseness or tightness of
the mating thread and is indicated by a 1, 2, or 3 following a dash. The
numbers identify three classes: 1 means a loose fit and is used for quick
assembly, 2 means a regular fit and is the one that is commonly used for all
general applications, and 3 indicates a tight fit with little or no clearance.
When the class is not shown, class 2 is indicated by default.
5. Internal or external designation (optional): Either A for external or B for
internal. The internal-external designator may not be shown if the drawing
makes it obvious.
6. Left-hand designator (left-handed threads only): Threads are generally right
hand, but occasionally an application requires a left-hand thread. Left-hand
threads are identified with “-LH” at the end of the designation.

Figure 9-13 Unified, coarse, external thread 
Figure 9-14 Unified, coarse, internal thread Metric Threads
Typical identification for metric threads is shown in Figures 9-15 and 9-16.

The identification for metric threads consists of: 1. Thread series
designation: M.
2. Nominal major diameter in millimeters.
3. Pitch (for fine pitch only): For coarse pitch threads, the pitch is not usually
indicated. If pitch is indicated, it follows the diameter separated by the letter
X.
Figure 9-15 Metric, coarse, external thread 

Figure 9-16 Metric, coarse, internal thread 4. Tolerance class (optional):
If it is indicated, it follows the pitch separated by a dash. The tolerance
class consists of a number (grade) and a letter (position) for the pitch
diameter tolerance and a number (grade) and a letter (position) for the
major (or minor) diameter tolerance. The smaller the tolerance grade, the
tighter the fit; the larger the grade, the looser the fit. Table 9-8 shows the
letters and numbers used for the tolerance class.
5. Left-hand designator (left-handed threads only): Threads are generally right
hand, but occasionally an application requires a left-hand thread. Left-hand
threads are identified with “-L” at the end of the designation.

Tolerance classes for external threads providing a small allowance are: 
Normal tolerance—tolerance class 6g6g  Tighter tolerance—tolerance class
4g6h Tolerance classes for internal threads to provide no allowance (which is
typical practice) are:  Normal tolerance—tolerance class 6H6H
 Tighter tolerance—tolerance class 4H5H
The metric equivalent of the UN 2A/2B class uses an internal thread of
tolerance class 6H6H and an external thread of tolerance class 6g6g. If a metric
thread does not indicate any tolerance class, this one applies. For the high-
precision (3A/3B equivalent) fit, external threads of the tolerance class 4h6h,
combined with internal threads 4H5H, are similar.
The major diameter tolerance may be omitted if it is the same as the pitch
diameter tolerance; i.e., an external tolerance class of 6g6g may appear on the
print as only “6g.” Both tolerances may be omitted if they are both grade 6.
Acme Threads
A typical identification for a general-purpose Acme thread is shown in Figure 9-
17.
The identifier for Acme threads consists of: 1. Nominal outside diameter:
The diameter is followed by a dash.
2. Number of threads per inch.
3. Thread series major designation: One of ACME or STUB ACME.
4. Tolerance class of fit (optional) following a dash: Classes range from 2
through 6. Class 2 is a nominal fit and the one used for all general
applications. Acme centralizing threads have critical clearance fits for special
applications and come in tolerance classes 2 through 6, general-purpose
threads in classes 2 through 5.
5. Thread series type designation: One of C (centralizing) or G (general
purpose).
6. Left-hand designator (left-handed threads only): Threads are generally right
hand, but occasionally an application requires a left-hand thread. Left-hand
threads are identified with “-LH” at the end of the designation.

Figure 9-17 Acme threads designation Buttress Threads
A typical identification for a buttress thread is shown in Figure 9-18.

Figure 9-18 Buttress threads designation The identifier for buttress
threads consists of: 1. Nominal outside diameter: The diameter is
followed by a dash.
2. Number of threads per inch.
3. Thread series designation: One of BUTT or PUSH-BUTT.
4. Tolerance class of fit (optional) following a dash: Either class 2 or 3. Class 2
is standard grade; class 3 is precision grade.
5. Internal or external designation (optional): Either A for external or B for
internal. The internal-external designator may not be shown if the drawing
makes it obvious.
6. Left-hand designator (left-handed threads only): Threads are generally right
hand, but occasionally an application requires a left-hand thread. Left-hand
threads are identified with “-LH” at the end of the designation.
Taper Pipe Threads
A typical identification for a standard taper pipe thread is shown in Figure 9-19.
The identifier for taper pipe threads consists of: 1. Nominal pipe size: The
size is followed by a dash.

2. Number of threads per inch (optional).
3. Thread series designation: NPT.

3. Thread series designation: NPTF.
Figure 9-20 Dryseal threads Metric Pipe Threads

Several typical identifications for standard metric pipe threads are shown in
Figure 9-21.
The identifier for standard metric pipe threads consists of: 1. Thread series
designation: One of ISO 7/1-Rp - metric pipe threads, straight (internal); ISO
7/1-Rc - metric pipe threads, tapered (internal); ISO 7/1-R - metric pipe threads,
tapered (external); or ISO 228/1-G - metric pipe threads, straight (internal or
external).
2. Nominal pipe size: The size is not preceded by a dash.
3. Tolerance class of fit (optional): One of A (closer) or B (looser).
Figure 9-21 Metric pipe threads Additional Designations
Internal threads are commonly formed by first drilling a hole, then using a tool
called a tap to remove additional material resulting in the complete tooth form.
On some prints the tap drill hole size is indicated, as seen in Figure 9-22. The tap

drill may not be shown on some prints because it is common knowledge in most
manufacturing facilities.

Introduction
Several terms used in the manufacturing of parts by machining or other methods
may need clarification. The purpose of this chapter is to examine some
machining terms, features, and processing instructions that you may not be
familiar with. Notes indicating particular features or details will then be easier to
understand and have greater meaning when they are seen on a print.
Machine Terms
Terms used with machine parts are usually not indicated directly on the drawing
of a part. Current practice is to show the feature needed in a view and specify the
dimension(s) and tol-erance(s) necessary to describe the feature. Prior practice
used more notes and language on prints. For example, a title block note may
state that all fillets have a .250-inch radius unless otherwise specified. The
drawing may show a fillet, but it may not have a direct reference or dimension.
The term “fillet” must be known in order to understand the drawing.
Another example is the term “draft.” A note may state that all drafts are 5° ±
1°, unless otherwise specified. A drawing may or may not show surfaces with

drafts. Unless the term “draft” is understood, the drawing cannot be read
properly.
What follows are some of the machine terms that may appear on prints.
Some of them have been seen before in prior chapters.
Chamfer
To chamfer an edge means to produce a chamfer feature. A chamfer is a removal
of a small amount of material from an edge; see Figures 5-55 and 5-56.
Deburr
A burr is an unwanted sharp edge that extends from a surface, as shown in
Figure 10-1. Burrs may be at the end of a shaft, around the edge of a hole, or at
the edge of any surface. These burrs are caused by machining operations and, in
most cases, must be removed.

Figure 10-1 Typical burrs Deburring is the process of removing unwanted
burrs and sharp edges. Burrs and sharp edges may cause injury or
interfere with the operation of a part or assembly. Therefore they are
usually removed. Deburring may be accomplished by manual or machine
wire brushing, filing, extrude honing, tumbling, or other methods that may
be specifically indicated.
It is difficult to produce internal corners that are sharp; they often retain
material that deviates from the ideal shape. The print may not specify how sharp
internal corners must be, nor how sharp external corners are allowed to be, and
simply leave it up to common machine shop practices.

The edge state symbol in Figure 10-2 is described in ISO Standard 13715
and specifies the state of either external edges or internal corners. This has the
advantage of permitting flexibility in how the edges are removed, while also
being specific about the distance from the edge allowed to be affected by the
process. Production of sharp internal and external corners is not left to chance or
to common practice but specified. Figure 10-3 gives several examples of the
symbol applied to a drawing.
Figure 10-2 Edge state symbol 

Figure 10-3 Applications of the edge state symbol Knurl
A knurl is a series of small V-shaped grooves on a round or internal surface.
Knurls are generally diamond-shaped, but they may also be straight; see Figure
10-4. The grooves of a knurl create a rough surface that is used to reduce
slippage and is sometimes used for decoration. Knurled surfaces are commonly
found on all types of hand tools and instruments. Knurls are machined with
hardened knurling wheels.
Knurling is typically not shown in detail, and it is specified by type, pitch,
and diameter before and/or after knurling.

Figure 10-4 A knurl is a series of small grooves.
Serrate
A serrated surface is a flat or curved area that has a series of small V-shaped
grooves. Serrations are generally diamond-shaped; see Figure 10-5. They are
commonly found on machine tools and are used to reduce slippage.

Figure 10-5 A serrated surface has a series of small V-shaped grooves.
Keyseats and Keyways
A key is a fastener used to lock a shaft and hub together for the transmission of
torque. Keys are typically used with gears, sprockets, and lever arms. A key sits
in a keyseat in the shaft that holds the key, and it permits a hub with a keyway to
fit over it; see Figure 10-6. The key may be fastened to the shaft, contained
within a pocket, or clamped together with a set screw through the hub. Keyseat
and keyway geometry is standardized in ASME B17.1 for English keys and DIN
6885 for metric keys.

Figure 10-6 Key application Prior practice to specify keyseat and keyway
features was with a note. Though geometry is standardized, in order to
eliminate any confusion and ambiguity, the current practice is to
dimension and tolerance all features directly, using the methods of
Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Where features are still found to be indicated by
note as was prior practice, the indication KEYSEAT or KEYWAY shown in
Figure 10-7 may be found.

Figure 10-7 Prior practice rectangular keyseat and keyway indications
Keyseat and keyway geometry is shown in Figure 10-8. In the English
system, the keyway and keyseat are dimensioned by width and depth at
the side of the feature. The keyway dimension is indicated by W × T2,
and the keyseat dimension is indicated by W × T1. Unless otherwise
specified, the shaft keyway is assumed to be standard. A list of standard
key and corresponding keyseat and keyway dimensions for English
shafts is provided in Table 10-1.
Figure 10-8 Rectangular keyseat terminology In the metric system, the
keyway note specifies the key width and height, W × H. A list of standard
key and corresponding keyseat and keyway dimensions for metric shafts
and hubs is given in Table 10-2.

Neck, Undercut, Groove
A groove cut into a cylindrical surface may be referred to as a “groove,” “neck,”
or “undercut.” They are used when a flush fit is necessary; the feature eliminates
a radius between the diameter and the shoulder that may interfere with a flush
fit, as in Figure 10-9.
Prior practice was to indicate these features on prints by note “NECK,”
“GROOVE,” or “UNDERCUT” and indicating width and depth, as seen in
Figure 10-10. Current practice is to use the dimensions that are also shown in
Figure 10-10.

Figure 10-9 A neck allows a flush fit between mating parts.
Figure 10-10 Prior practice and current practice to specify grooves
Sawcut
A sawcut feature is a narrow slot through a part produced by a reciprocating,
band or circular saw typically for initial roughing out. Sawcuts may be indicated
on drawings by SAWCUT note and width rather than dimensioned directly,
indicating that a tight tolerance and good surface finish are not needed.
Holes
Several round holes produced by various methods are shown in Figure 10-11. In
prior drawing practice, round holes were commonly indicated by the machining
process used to produce them, such as DRILL, REAM, BORE, BROACH, EDM
(e.g., WIRE EDM, PLUNGE EDM), COUNTERBORE, COUNTERSINK,

COUNTERDRILL, SPOTFACE, DRILL & TAP, etc.
DRILL indicates a hole to be machined by drilling with a twist drill. REAM
indicates a two-operation process of predrilling and then reaming, which
removes a small amount of material and achieves a more accurate diameter and
smooth finish. BORE indicates the use of a boring bar to enlarge a rough hole to
produce a more accurate diameter and smooth finish. The predrill diameter may
or may not be indicated for reamed and bored holes.
Current practice is to produce prints using symbols that indicate the hole’s
dimensions and tolerances using the techniques of Chapter 5, 6, and 7, not
provide specific manufacturing instructions that might be inappropriate.
Mill
Milling is one of the most common machining operations, and current drawing
practice does not specify the process to be used to produce the feature. In prior
practice some prints include terms such as “END MILL” or “FACE MILL,”
indicating the intended manufacturing practice.
Grind
The word “GRIND” has been used in prior drawing practice to indicate the
intended manufacturing practice and expected surface texture.


Figure 10-11 Some different types of holes Machining Centers
Centers are holes produced on parts machined on a lathe, used to engage the
tailstock and headstock and mount the workpiece while it is being machined; see
Figure 10-12. They are nonfunctional features on the finished part. For some
parts, it is unacceptable to produce parts with centers. These parts may require
another machining operation after the lathe work is completed, for example to
reduce the length of the piece and eliminate the center.
Figure 10-12 Shaft centers When centers are dimensioned in detail on
prints, they may appear as in Figure 5-61.
English prints may indicate centers by reference to the center drill used to
produce the center, such as CENTER DRILL #4. Center drills are governed by
the ASME B94.11 standard. Dimensions of the holes produced by center drills
are given in Table 10-3.

For metric prints, reference may be made to the ISO 6411 standard, as shown
in Figure 10-13. Two hole shapes are identified with the letter R or A. The
number following the letter indicator is the center size, d1. Other dimensions of
the center holes depend on d1 and are given in Table 10-4.
Alternatively, a general note “CENTERS PERMITTED” may appear, giving
the machine shop leeway as to the exact size, shape, and even presence of a shaft
center.

Markings
Parts may be marked with their item number and revision, serial number,
production lot number, company logo, or any other marking. Common methods
of marking indicated on prints appear in Table 10-5.
Manufacturing Processes
Generally, there is more than one way to manufacture each feature of a part.
Current practice is for prints to show finished part requirements only and not to
specify any manufacturing instructions except when following a specific
manufacturing process is essential.
In prior practice, general manufacturing instructions were very common even
when following the general instructions was not mandatory.
Table 10-5 Part Marking Indications
ELECTROCHEMICAL
ETCH
Uses an electric current to create high-contrast marking without
surface distortion
EMBOSS
Uses mechanical stamps, similar to typewriter keys, to indent marking
into the surface using hammer or press
INK STAMP
Uses ink that may be applied by a rubber applicator or metal printing
die
INKJET
Uses an inkjet marking tool to propel droplets of ink onto the part
surface
LASER MARK
Uses a low-powered laser to heat the material, causing oxidation
under the surface and turning the material black
LASER ETCH
Uses a laser to melt away the topmost layer of metal, resulting in a
raised mark
MARK
Nonspecific term used when the marking technology is not specified
PAINT
Uses paint applied by rubber applicator or stencil
SCRIBE
Uses a sharp stylus to scrape lines including lettering into the part, can
be powered or done by hand
DOT PEEN
Uses a sharp stylus to physically indent dots into patterns forming
letters on the surface of the part
General Instructions
Some prints use general terms to specify manufacturing operations, and many of
these terms have been defined and illustrated in this text. The manufacturer may
have newer, better, or different technologies available for producing the part but
would be unable to use them because the print specifies particular methods. A
manufacturer interested in using a method contrary to that indicated on the print
must request a deviation from the customer, which may also result in a revision
of the customer’s print.

Specific Instructions
Specific manufacturing information may include all or most of the data
pertaining to the manufacturing operation. Specific instructions for machining
operations may include equipment, tools, speeds, and coolants. Specific
instructions for castings may include pattern identifier, sand type, binders,
additives, cooling time, descaling methods, etc. Specific instructions may be
found on the print, or they may be found on a process specification document
referenced from the print.
Finished Part Requirements Only
Current practice for making prints is to specify dimensions but not
manufacturing processes. An exception is made if a specific process is essential
to meet certain requirements; specific machining instructions are then shown.
Showing only finished part requirements allows a manufacturer to use any
method. This permits the use of the method that best suits the manufacturer’s
needs and equipment. An option of this type will generally provide the best
quality at the lowest cost. This method allows the manufacturer to use newer
manufacturing methods that might be better suited to making the part, without
requiring print changes.
Although prints may indicate finished part requirements only, parts are
designed with consideration of the manufacturing process that will be used to
produce them. A part designed as a forging will contain drafted surfaces,
rounded corners, and parting lines, whereas an equivalent part designed as a
machined part would have square surfaces, sharp corners, and no parting lines. It
would be difficult to make one print that a forged part and a machined version of
the same part would both conform to.
Changing the Manufacturing Process
It may be relatively easy for a machine shop to substitute one material-removal
operation indicated on a print (e.g., reaming) in favor of another material-
removal operation (e.g., end milling). It would be more difficult to manufacture
a part as a casting that was originally designed to be machined. It’s unlikely that
many parts designed as formed sheet metal would ever be made by machining.
Nevertheless, for some parts it is possible to completely change the intended
manufacturing process.
Manufacturing technologies and economics do evolve over time. Many parts
that were designed as castings have been recently made more economically as
weldments. Parts that were designed as weldments have been recently made
more economically by material-removal processes exclusively, beginning from a
large block of metal.
Heat Treatment of Metals

Many metal parts are heat-treated before use. Heat treatment involves the
controlled heating and cooling of a metal to obtain desirable changes in
mechanical properties. Heat treatment is usually indicated by note on the title
block. Notes can refer to specific heat treatment processes in associated
reference documents, they can be general, or they can leave the methods
unspecified and indicate only the final hardness required.
Some terminology related to heat treating that may appear on prints is
defined below.
Several scales have been developed to measure hardness of materials, each
with its own testing methodology. Hardness is usually specified using one of the
hardness scales in Table 10-6.

Table 10-7 Terms Used in the Hardening of Steels
QUENCH
Rapid cooling of a heated part in a quenching medium. The quenching medium
depends upon the size and shape of the part as well as on the grade of steel.
Water, oil, and air are most common and may be specified. Hardened parts are
normally tempered after hardening to reduce the hardening stresses and
increase the toughness.
TEMPER
Tempering or drawing is used to lower a metal's brittleness or hardness. It
involves heating the steel to below the metal's critical range. The exact
temperature depends on the type of steel used and its application.
STRESS-
RELIEVE
Stress relieving reduces the internal stresses that are the result of mechanical
cold working during machining, drawing, bending, or other similar operations.
Stresses are relieved by heating the metal to a temperature below the
transformation temperature and then allowing the material to cool slowly to
room temperature.
ANNEAL OR
NORMALIZE
Both annealing and normalizing soften the material to release internal stresses
developed in manufacturing processes such as forging. They involve heating
the metal above the transformation temperature, holding it there a sufficient
time for the structure to transform, and then cooling at a slow rate.
To harden steel, it is heated to a temperature above the transformation
temperature and then cooled rapidly. The length of time at the elevated
temperature and the cooling rate depend on the type of steel. Specific indications
that may appear on prints are given in Table 10-7.
Cast iron can be annealed to soften it, remove residual casting stresses, and
improve its machinability. Normalizing involves heating the casting and then
cooling in air; this restores the cast material’s properties and improves hardness
and tensile strength. Gray iron is hardened by heating it above the transformation
temperature and quenching it in oil; see Table 10-8.
Table 10-8 Terms Used in the Hardening of Cast Iron
AUSTEMPER
Austempering and martempering are treatments given to gray iron to provide
heat-treated properties without the high stresses associated with a full quench.
Hardness depends on the carbon and alloy content.
MARTEMPER
Aluminum alloys cannot be heat-treated in the same way as steel but can be
hardened by other processes such as age hardening or solution treating; see Table
10-9.
Table 10-9 Terms Used in the Hardening of Aluminum
AGE-
HARDEN
Age-hardening treatment depends on the alloy and can range from no heat
(when precipitation takes place at room temperature over a few days) to a
longtime process at low temperatures.
SOLUTION-
REAT
Solution-treating temperatures vary by alloy but generally involve holding the

parts at temperature and then quenching in water so that cooling occurs rapidly.

Introduction
Metal-removal processes (e.g., cutting, turning, drilling, milling, etc.) can be
effectively used to generate a wide variety of parts and part geometry. As a
group they do not have any easily identified common characteristics. Casting,
forging, and molding are three common manufacturing methods that do impose

specific requirements on the designs of parts produced, resulting in some
predictable elements on their prints. For example, draft is a feature found on
nearly all these parts. When the manufacturing involves the casting process or
forming processes such as metal forging or plastic molding, parts are likely to
have certain features in common, and prints are likely to include certain symbols
and notes that should be understood.
In this chapter, special attention is given to a select few common
manufacturing methods and the print indications most commonly associated
with them.
Manufacturing Processes
Casting
There are several different types of castings, such as sand castings, die castings,
and investment castings. With each process, molten metal is poured into a part
cavity where it solidifies as it cools. Casting can economically produce near-net-
shape parts requiring minimal secondary machining operations.
The design of cast parts includes details such as drafts, fillets, rounds, and
parting lines. The casting process itself may produce flash and other artifacts of
the casting process—not desired features of the final part, but ones which must
be dealt with.
Forging
Forging is one of the oldest metal manufacturing processes and produces near-
net-shape parts by applying compressive forces to the workpiece. Forging
usually involves very heavy dies, and it involves parts that may or may not be
heated. The resulting parts have a well-controlled metal grain structure and
therefore good strength and toughness. Forgings have many characteristics like
castings, such as draft, fillets and rounds, parting lines, and flash.
Molding
Injection molding of plastic is very similar to hot-chamber die casting of metals.
Plastic pellets or granules are fed into a heated cylinder, melted, and forced
under pressure into a mold. The molten plastic passes from the injection mold
machine into the mold, where it may branch into several feed channels called
“runners,” each leading to a gate, the entrance to the part cavity.
After the plastic cools, the mold is opened and the parts are ejected. Injection
molding can economically produce a wide variety of parts in large quantities
after an investment in the mold and molding equipment. Other molding
processes such as blow molding, rotational molding, and compression molding
are widely used. Though different, the parts that are candidates for these
manufacturing processes and the prints used have similarities.
Typical molded part details include draft, parting lines, fillets and rounds,

flash, ejector pin locations, and gate locations.
Finishing
Cast, forged, and molded parts often require finishing after their initial
processing, such as cleaning, removal of scale, removal of risers, trimming of
gate vestige, and trimming of flash from the parting line. These finishing
operations are usually not detailed on the print but are known to the
manufacturer. After finishing operations are complete, the part is said to be in its
as-cast (or as-forged or as-molded) state.
Post-Processing
Post-processing, also called “secondary operations,” refers to work performed on
the as-cast (or as-forged) part. These operations are generally material-removal
processes to produce accurate features and surfaces and improve surface finish
on those areas requiring it.
General Considerations
Parting Plane
Also called the “die plane” for dies, the “mold plane” for molds, or the “forging
plane” for forgings, the parting plane represents the plane formed by the mating
surfaces of the mold or die. The parting plane is perpendicular to the opening
and closing action of the mold, die, or forging press.
Parting Line
A parting line is the meeting of two surfaces drafted in opposite directions and
occurs where the two halves of a mold or die come together at the parting plane.
The parting line coincides with the opening (or “parting”) of the mold or die for
cast, forged, or molded parts; see Figure 11-1.
Draft
A draft is a slight angle or taper on the surface of a casting, forging, or molded
part; see Figure 11-2. Draft is measured with reference to the parting plane. The
tapered surface may be flat or curved, or it may be a hole. Drafts allow easier
removal of parts from molds or dies.

Figure 11-1 A parting line occurs where two halves of a die come
together.

Figure 11-2 A draft is a tapered or angled surface.
Mismatch
Mismatch is any offset of features caused by imperfect alignment of opposing
mold or die halves at the parting plane. Mismatch can be large on sand cast parts,
but it is typically small on molded parts.
Die Closure
Die closure refers to any variation caused by the imperfect coming together of
opposed mold or die halves at the parting plane; see Figure 11-3. Because of die
closure, dimensions crossing the parting line are produced with less accuracy
than dimensions on one side of the mold.
Flash
Flash is excessive residual material at the parting line and can form because of
die closure, as in Figure 11-3. Flash is also caused when mold and die cavity
edges are not sharp enough. Even hardened steel molds used for injection
molding wear over time through use, and mold cavities begin to produce flash.

Figure 11-3 Flash is excessive material at the parting line.
Fillets and Rounds
Fillets and rounds are shown in Figure 5-52 and help with the flow of material
into molds and dies. It is typical for cast, forged, and molded parts to have all
external corners rounded and all internal corners filleted.
Ejector Pins
Ejector pins are also called “knockout pins” and mechanically push the molded
plastic part out of the mold when it is sufficiently cooled. Molded parts must
have sufficient area for mold designers to design ejector systems, which usually
consist of pins but may also include pads and plates.
Gate
The gate is the entrance to the part cavity from the runner and the location on the
part where the plastic or molten metal enters to fill the part cavity. After a part is
cooled, the plastic is broken away from the remaining plastic in the mold at the
gate. The term “gate” also applies to the point on a casting where the molten
metal enters the part cavity. “Gate vestige” is the term for excessive unwanted
material remaining at the gate location.
Shrink

The molten metal of castings and molten plastic of molded parts both shrink as
they cool and solidify. Solidification shrinkage values are given as percentages,
depending on the exact blend of polymer used or alloy of metal used, and are
published as tables. Shrinkage is accounted for in the design and construction of
the injection mold or casting pattern. Mold cavities and casting patterns are
larger than the intended finished part. Once built, the same mold or pattern is
used for all parts in the lot.
Solidification shrinkage percentages are not exact, so when dimensional
variation exists in castings and molded parts it is typical for all dimensions to
trend high together or to trend low together. Unlike material-removal processes
that produce individual features independently of one another, all cast and
molded features are produced simultaneously. Adjustments can usually be made
to the process to adjust all part dimensions together.
Warp
Another feature of the “all-at-once” manufacturing process is that if cooling
occurs unevenly, parts tend to warp or twist. The amount of warpage may be
slight. The dimensions between features that are physically close to one another
may be maintained within tolerance, but features further from one another show
poor dimensional control between them, as in Figure 11-4.
Figure 11-4 Warped part and straight part Defects
In addition to the shape-related defects above, these parts are also subject to
filling-related defects (such as blowholes, incomplete filling, sand burning, sand
inclusion, cold lap, mis-run, and gas porosity), thermal defects (such as cracks
and tears, shrinkage porosity, and sink marks), and appearance defects (such as
pinholes, hot cracking, and flow marks).

Print Methods
Prints for cast, forged, and molded parts generally show details of all features
that are common parts made with these manufacturing methods such as draft and
parting lines. If these details are not shown, they are left to the discretion of the
organization making the part. The details may be based on standard practices or
their experience with the customer. The general note “GATE, RISER, VENT,
PARTING LINE, EJECTOR PIN LOCATIONS, AND OTHER TOOLING
CONSIDERATIONS 
TO 
BE 
APPROVED 
BEFORE 
TOOL
CONSTRUCTION” indicates that these details have not been specified and that
they need to be approved by the customer.
Initial processing and post-processing operations may be documented on
prints using several different methods, depending on the complexity of the part
and the standards of the company making the print. These are listed and
described in Table 11-1. Molded parts do not usually require secondary
processing, so machining details and composite prints are rare. Prints for molded
parts are usually finished part prints.
Symbols
Common symbols found on cast, forged, and molded prints are illustrated in
Table 11-2 along with their meaning.
Casting, Forging, and Molded Part Prints
Those features that are unique to castings, forgings, and molded parts, when they
appear on prints, need to be understood. These print details appear on the as-cast
(or as-forged or as-molded) prints made as separate prints, on the as-cast (or as-
forged or as-molded) views made as separate views, and on composite prints.
Orientation of the Parting Plane
The parting line may fall entirely in a plane, or it may have steps and contours
for more complex parts. For these parts it may be necessary to indicate the
parting plane on the drawing. The orientation of the parting plane relative to a
datum plane may be indicated by a note, as in Figure 11-5.
Table 11-1 Methods Used to Document Cast, Forged, and Molded Parts
Method
Description
Two
separate
prints
Two prints are made, each with its own item number and item name. The first print
documents the as-cast (or as-forged or as-molded) part. The second print
references the first item number as its material, and it documents all detail of
additional machining and other manufacturing processing to occur after casting,
forging, or molding.
One print,
separate
One print is made documenting all manufacturing details, but separate views on
the print show the part in its as-cast (or as-forged or as-molded) state and in its
final state after post-processing. Depending on the complexity of the part, this may
be accomplished using multiple drawing sheets. Dimensions produced during

views
post-processing are necessarily referenced back to features in the as-cast (or as-
forged) state.
One
composite
print
A composite print includes detailed information on the casting (or forging) process
and dimensions, as well as finished dimensions. Also includes features and
dimensions, and documents all detail of additional machining and other
manufacturing processing to occur after casting, forging, or molding. Dimensions
produced during post-processing are necessarily referenced back to features in
the as-cast (or as-forged) state.
One
finished
part print
This does not include references to the as-cast (or as-forged or as-molded) state
or intermediate features that are later removed. Shows only the dimensional
requirements of the finished part.

Figure 11-5 Orientation of a parting plane Parting Line
The location of parting lines may or may not be indicated on prints. If a parting
line might interfere with the function of a part, its location may be specified. The
parting line may be indicated by using the parting line symbol (from Table 11-2)
as shown in Figure 11-6 or by adding the note “PL” or “PARTING LINE.”

Figure 11-6 Parting line indicated Draft Angle
Angle dimensions for drafts may be indicated on prints, as shown in the drawing
on the left of Figure 11-2. Dimensions may be indicated as shown in the drawing
on the right of Figure 11-2. Drawings for parts that require drafts show the
dimensions that must be maintained.
Because the number of drafted surfaces on these parts would clutter the
drawing with draft angle dimensions, general notes are usually used instead,
such as “ALL DRAFTS TO BE 5° ± 1°, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED”
or “DRAFT 3° MAX.”
Draft angles are usually small, and it may be difficult to tell whether a
surface on a print is drafted or square. Surfaces may be shown pictorially as
nondrafted. Where drafted surfaces are shown pictorially as nondrafted, it is
necessary to indicate whether a dimension applies to the top of the drafted
surface or the bottom. A general note “DRAFT ADDS MATERIAL” or
“DRAFT REDUCES MATERIAL” may be used, as in Figure 11-7. In these
examples the draft angle is indicated by general note.
The +DFT symbol placed next to a dimension indicates that the stated
dimension may increase beyond its stated tolerance limits due to draft. The -DFT
symbol placed next to a dimension indicates that the stated dimension may
decrease below its stated tolerance limit due to draft. These symbols and their
interpretation are shown in Figure 11-8. The note clarifies whether the dimension
applies to the top of the drafted surface or the bottom. In these examples the
draft angle is indicated by general note.

Figure 11-7 Draft by general note 

Figure 11-8 Indicating draft using symbols The symbol “DRFT INCL”
placed next to a dimension indicates that the change in dimension
caused by draft must be within the stated tolerance, as in Figure 11-9.
The general note “DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES INCLUDE
DRAFT” has the same meaning and applies to all dimensions unless
otherwise indicated. In this example the draft angle is indicated by
general note.

Figure 11-9 Draft included in tolerance Mold Lines
A mold line refers to the theoretical intersection between surfaces whose edge
has been rounded, as in Figure 11-10. Castings, forgings, and molded parts
typically have most or all of their exterior edges rounded. Dimensions are given
to the mold lines, as in Figure 11-10, unless otherwise specified.

Figure 11-10 Dimensioning to mold lines Mismatch
Mismatch between mold halves may be indicated as a maximum value by
general note, as in Figure 11-11.

Figure 11-11 Maximum mismatch indication and meaning Die Closure
Dimensions crossing the parting line may have a die closure tolerance indicated
in a general note, as in Figure 11-12. Some prints use one set of general
tolerances for dimensions on the same side of the parting line and use a different,
wider set of general tolerances for dimensions crossing the parting line. When a
separate die closure tolerance is not indicated, any die closure tolerance is
included in the tolerance given to the dimension.
Figure 11-12 Additional die closure tolerance given Flash
The amount of flash permitted may be indicated by a note such as “FLASH
EXTENSION .020 MAX.” Any material beyond .020 inch must be removed; see
Figure 11-13.

Figure 11-13 Maximum flash indication and meaning Fillets and Rounds
Fillets and rounds may be dimensioned as in Figure 5-52. When there are too
many fillets and rounds to dimension without cluttering the print, a general note
may be used. Examples of general notes are “FILLET RADII .040 ± .010 UOS”
and “CORNER RADII 2.5 ± 0.5.” The note “FILLETS SHOWN SHARP R3
MAX” permits the drawing to be made with sharp corners and permits
dimensions to be drawn to sharp corners (which are also the mold lines),
eliminating the need for intersection lines.
Ejector Pins
Their locations may or may not be specified on prints. When specified, a local
note such as “EJECTOR PIN AREA” may be used. When optional, “EJECTOR
PIN PERMISSIBLE” may be used. Where prohibited, “EJECTOR PIN
PROHIBITED” may be used. Ejector pin remnants may be limited by notes such
as “EJECTOR PIN FLASH 0.5 MAXIMUM” or specified as included within
tolerances, as in “EJECTOR PIN MARKS/GATES/FLASH TO BE INCLUDED
WITHIN APPLICABLE GEOMETRIC AND LINEAR TOLERANCES.”
Gate Location
On parts where gate vestige has no impact on the part function, the gate location
may not be specified. On parts where gate location is specified, the gate size may
also be indicated, and gate vestige may be limited with a note such as “0.5 MAX
GATE VESTIGE.” See Figure 11-14.

Figure 11-14 Gate location Wall Thickness
Castings, forgings, and molded parts commonly maintain a uniform wall
thickness across many or all areas of the part. Where dimensioning each wall
thickness on the print would become excessive, this may be indicated by general
note such as “WALL THICKNESS .188 ±.015.”
Defects
Other types of defects may be controlled by local notes or general notes, such as
“NO SINK MARKS,” “CASTING TO BE FREE FROM POROSITY,”
“INSPECT FOR SHORT SHOTS THIS AREA,” and “FLOW MARKS NOT
PERMITTED.”
Datum Referencing
The use of datum targets is common on casting, forging, and molded part prints.
A datum reference frame may be established using datum target points, lines,
and areas. This is common on the as-cast (or as-forged or as-molded) print or
print view or on composite prints.
Datum Targets
Datum target symbols are indicated on the print as in Figure 11-15. In the bottom
half of the symbol are the datum letter indicating the datum being established

and a sequential number assigned to each target used in the establishment of the
datum. The locations of datum targets are all dimensioned to one another using
basic dimensions.
Datum targets come in three types: points, lines, or areas, as in Figure 11-16.
A datum target area includes a shape where appropriate, appearing in the upper
half of the datum target symbol.
When datum targets are used to construct datums, the datum feature symbols
still appear on the drawing. They establish the fixturing scheme for the part with
appropriate physical fixture elements such as spherical pins for datum target
points, tangent contact of round pins for datum target lines, and flat-ended pins
for datum target areas.
Figure 11-15 Datum target symbols 

Figure 11-16 Datum targets Datums from Machined Surfaces
Machined surfaces appearing on the as-machined print or print view, or on
composite prints, are often used as datum features in the construction of a second
datum reference frame, as in Figure 11-17. Datum reference frame A, B, C is
established from the targets on the imperfect, as-cast surfaces. These then form
the reference for machining the datum X surface. Datum X is also referenced in
the creation of datum features Y and Z, also machined features. The datum
reference frame X, Y, Z alone is then referenced to locate the 20-millimeter hole.
Sample Prints
To better illustrate the concepts presented in this chapter, several sample prints
are provided.
Casting Prints
Figures 11-18 and 11-19 show a casting print for a column base using two
separate prints: one for the as-cast part and one for the machining operations.
The machining print specifies the number of the casting as the material to be
used for the machining operation.
A composite print of a cast sleeve spindle is shown in Figure 11-20, which
includes all basic casting data as well as machining requirements.

Introduction
Fabrication of parts by welding and fabrication of sheet metal parts by forming,
cutting, and welding operations are common practices that impose unique
requirements on the designs of parts produced, resulting in some predictable

elements on their prints. When the manufacturing involves the welding process
or forming processes such as bending, parts are likely to have certain features in
common, and prints are likely to include certain symbols and notes that should
be understood.
In this chapter, special attention is given to a select few common
manufacturing methods and the print indications most commonly associated
with them.
Welding
Machine parts may be assembled and held in place using several methods other
than mechanical fasteners. Parts may be welded, soldered, or brazed, or they
may be bonded or cemented with an adhesive. These methods are very popular
and are replacing many threaded assemblies. Welding may range from simple
spot welding to one of many very technical procedures. Bonding may range
from simple solvent bonding of plastics to fastening of materials with specially
compounded adhesives. Procedures for fastening by welding or bonding are
specified on prints with symbols or separate notes.
There are five common basic types of weld joints that characterize the
position of parts being welded: butt, tee, corner, lap, and edge, as illustrated in
Table 12-1.
There are four types of arc and gas welds: backing, fillet, plug or slot, and
groove, as illustrated in Table 12-2. Groove welds are further divided among
square, V, bevel, U, and J. Welds may be applied to one or both sides of a welded
joint.

Post-Processing
Post-processing, also called “secondary operations,” refers to work performed on
the welded part assembly after welding. Many weldments are used without post-
processing, but precision parts may require additional operations. These
operations are generally material-removal processes to produce accurate features
and surfaces and improve surface finish on those areas requiring it.
Welding Symbols
The welding symbol is shown in Figure 12-1. Welding symbols indicate the
physical type of weld, such as a fillet or a seam weld, as well as other
specifications related to the weld. Use of this symbol has been standardized by
the American Welding Society in its publication AWS Standard A2.4. The
symbol is shown in Figure 12-1 along with the locations of the various weld

process indications for specifying type, size, contour, finish, and other
characteristics.
An explanation of the various specifications of the welding symbols follows.
Note that the most common types of welds and uses of the welding symbols are
detailed here. For a comprehensive explanation of all welding symbols used in
industry, see the AWS standard.
Basic Weld Symbol
The most important part of the welding symbol is the basic weld symbol. One of
the basic weld symbols from Table 12-2 indicating weld type is found on a line
called the “reference line,” attached with a leader whose arrow points to the joint
where the weld is to be made.
Arrow Side and Far Side
The basic weld symbol appears above or below the reference line. When the
symbol is placed above the reference line, the weld is to be made on the far side
of the joint indicated by the arrow, as shown in Figure 12-2. When the symbol is
placed below the reference line, the weld is to be made on the near side of the
joint. When the weld symbols appear both above and below the reference line,
welds are required on both sides of the joint.
Plug and slot welds are typically used on lap joints, though in some cases
they may also be applied to tee joints. Unlike other joints, a lap joint may be
illustrated in a plan view or in the standard elevation view available for other
joints. When the weld symbol is applied in the plan view, the “arrow side” is the
member visible on top in that view; the “far side” is the hidden member. When
applied in an elevation view, the “arrow side”-“far side” designation follows the
convention for other joints shown in elevation view. A hole or slot is made in
one member to receive the weld. The hole or slot is produced in the member
indicated by the arrow-side designation of the basic weld symbol.

Figure 12-1 Welding symbol Size
When a fillet basic weld symbol is used, the size of the weld leg is found to the
left of the symbol (position “S” in Figure 12-1; all the positions noted below are
shown in Figure 12-1). Fillet welds usually have equal-length legs, although legs
of different length may be specified; see Figure 12-3.
When a groove basic weld symbol is used, the size specification in position
“S” indicates the depth of the groove (V, bevel, U, or J). Where no size is
indicated, the groove is the full depth of the member.

Figure 12-2 Arrow-side and far-side interpretation

Figure 12-3 Fillet welds When a plug or slot basic weld symbol is used,
the size specification in position “S” refers to the diameter of the hole
produced in the arrow-side member. Width, length, and orientation of slot
welds cannot be shown fully using the welding symbol and must be
illustrated.
Length and Pitch
A pair of numbers separated by a dash (positions “L” and “P”) indicates chain or
intermittent welds, as in Figure 12-4. The first number is the length of each
weld; the second number is the pitch.

Figure 12-4 Chain or intermittent welds Groove Angle
When a groove basic weld symbol is used, the angle specification in position
“A” indicates the groove angle, as in Figure 12-5.
When a plug or slot basic weld symbol is used, the angle specification in
position “A” indicates the included angle of the hole or slot, which is
countersunk.

Figure 12-5 Groove welds Root Opening and Depth of Filling
When a groove basic weld symbol is used, the number in position “R” specifies
the size of the root opening prior to welding.
When a plug or slot basic weld symbol is used, the number in position “R”
specifies the depth of filling; see Figure 12-6. Plug and slot welds are understood
to fill the depth of the hole or slot unless a weld size is given in position “R.”

Figure 12-6 Plug welds Contour Symbol
The contour symbol (shown as a straight line for flush in Figure 12-1) is a
supplementary symbol that can be shown next to the weld symbol to indicate if
the weld surface is to be flush (flatfaced), convex, or concave; see Table 12-3.

Finish Symbol
The presence of a letter next to the contour symbol (position “F”) indicates the
machining process to be used to achieve the indicated contour (C: chipping, G:
grinding, M: machining, R: rolling, or H: hammering). Examples of contour
symbols and finish symbols applied to various basic weld symbols are shown in
Figure 12-7.

Welds over an Indicated Length
Unless otherwise indicated, welds are applied to the entire joint. A weld may be
specified to be applied to a limited length of a joint, as in Figure 12-9.
Welding Prints
Welding prints must show the geometry of parts prior to being welded together.
Welded parts may be made from simple bars, plates, rods, and structural profiles
whose geometry can be easily described on the print. In such a case, the print
will provide leaders with part numbers for each part and a material schedule
listing all component parts. When the description of individual parts is more
complicated, each component is described by its own print, and the weld print is
made as an assembly print with a separate BOM and all the required setup
dimensions and weld symbols.
Fabrication, assembly, welding, and postprocessing operations may be
documented on prints using several different methods, depending on the

complexity of the part and the standards of the company making the print.
Methods of producing welding prints, sometimes called “weldment prints,” are
listed and described in Table 12-6.
Figure 12-9 Welds over an indicated length A welding print of an air line
assembly is shown in Figure 12-10. Note that the stock pieces to be
welded are annotated by balloon, indicating that they are detailed in their

own separate prints. The symbol indicates a fillet weld around the outside
edge of the flange and fitting. No post-processing is required.
A similar welding print of a core stacking assembly is shown in Figure 12-

A welding print for a precision bracket is shown in Figure 12-12. Note that
different views are used for the welding and machining.

accomplished using multiple drawing sheets. Features and dimensions produced
during post-processing are necessarily referenced back to features in the as-
welded state.

Figure 12-13 Composite print Sheet Metal
The term “sheet metal” refers to flat sheets of metal that generally range in
thickness from about 1/64 to 1/8 inch. The term applies to any type of metal such
as steel, aluminum, or copper. Parts that are made out of sheet metal may be
processed flat, bent into various shapes, and/or joined together. Sheet metal parts
may be simple or complex.
With sheet metal, many forming processes can be performed using punches
and dies while the metal is flat, such as shearing, slitting, cutting, sawing,
punching, blanking, stamping, and embossing. Bending processes include roll
forming, stretch forming, drawing, spinning, peen forming, and others. Joining
processes include resistance welding and press-fit assembly of attachments.
Some features common to sheet metal parts include a constant stock or reference
thickness, bends, and burrs.
Stock Thickness
Sheet metal is manufactured to a variety of stock thickness, also called the
“material gage.” A sheet metal part made from one gage of material will

maintain a consistent thickness throughout. The nominal gage or thickness will
be indicated on the title block or other material schedule, and may not appear on
the print as a dimension with a tolerance. Material thickness may appear as a
reference dimension. Note that depending on the grade of material specified,
actual tolerances and actual thickness may vary.
A sheet metal material thickness is a local size measurement and does not
impose any additional requirement over the form (flatness, straightness). Sheet
metal is thin and can be flexible due to its thinness.
Bends
Bends applied to sheet metal are generally classified as V-bends or edge bends.
V-bends are made using a V-shaped punch and die. Edge bends are made in a
wiping die. Other bending processes include rotary bending, air bending, and
tube forming.
Punches and dies are available to produce many specific V-bends, such as
channel bends, U-bends, and offset bends; see Figure 12-14.

Figure 12-14 Bends Edge bending produces flange features, hems, and
seams. A wide variety of hems and seams are used for sheet metal part
fabrication; see Figure 12-15. Hems hide cut edges and stiffen sheet
metal construction. Seams join sheet metal parts and may be left as bent

or they may be welded, soldered, brazed, or riveted.
In rubber forming (also called hydroforming or fluid forming), the upper die
is made of flexible rubber or polyurethane and pressed by hydraulic pressure
onto the sheet metal workpiece, which causes it to bend over a forming die
underneath.
Figure 12-15 Hems and seams Burrs
Sheet metal parts processed by punches and dies have burrs that remain on the
fractured edges. Deburring may be specified by general note or local note.
Assembled Hardware
Sheet metal parts are commonly made with nuts, studs, and other assembled add-
ins. These features allow attachment of sheet metal parts to one another or to
other types of parts. Sheet metal prints may specify the permanent attachment of
a variety of hardware, either by note as in Figure 12-16 or as an assembly
drawing (see Chapter 14).

Figure 12-16 Sheet metal print with assembled hardware
Threaded inserts allow attachments of fasteners to sheet metal parts that are
not thick enough to develop the full strength of a threaded hole. Sheet metal
fasteners are pressed into sheet metal through holes or blind holes. Some are
flush with the opposite side of the part. Some attach to the outer edge. When
pressed into holes, they are permanently locked in place.
Sheet metal nuts are available in locking and nonlocking nuts and provide
load-bearing threads in thin sheets, permitting threaded fasteners to be
assembled to the sheet metal part. Nuts are available in a variety of styles
including floating, blind nuts, flash nuts, and right angle nuts.
Sheet metal studs are threaded posts that allow the assembly of the part into
clearance holes. Studs are available in a variety of shapes including concealed

head, flush head, unthreaded, and swaging collar.
Sheet metal standoffs are internally threaded posts. Like nuts, they permit
assembly of a threaded fastener, but they are offset from the sheet by a distance.
They are available in concealed-head, threaded, and self-clinching varieties,
among others.
Captive panel hardware includes a variety of threaded fasteners captured in a
housing that is permanently attached to the sheet metal. They permit attachment
of sheet metal parts using easily attached and easily detached fasteners, without
losing the fastener. Captive screws with various heads are available in both
spring-loaded and non-spring-loaded varieties.
Sheet-to-sheet attachment hardware allows the permanent joining of two
metal sections or metal to plastic.
Resistance Welding
Although many of the gas and arc welds illustrated in the welding section are
used for sheet metal parts, resistance welding is also used for joining parts in lap
and edge joints common to sheet metal.
There are four types of resistance welds, as illustrated in Table 12-7.
Resistance welds are indicated using the welding symbol of Figure 12-1 and one
of the basic weld symbols from Table 12-7. Resistance welds usually do not
have an arrow-side or far-side designation appearing on the reference line. Spot,
projection, and seam welds are indicated by leader arrows directed to the surface
to be welded in plan view.
Table 12-7 Resistance Welding Symbols
Symbol
Illustration
Description
Spot or Projection
Seam

Flash or Upset
Spot welds are specified by the spot diameter (in position “S”—again, see
Figure 12-1 for the different welding positions) or by the shear strength the weld
must withstand in pounds per spot (for English drawings) or newtons per spot
(for metric drawings). Pitch is commonly indicated (in position “P”) without a
length since the spot weld has no length. Alternatively, the number of spot welds
may be indicated (in position “N”) instead of pitch; see Figure 12-17.
Seam welds are specified by the seam width (in position “S”) or by the shear
strength the weld must withstand in pounds per linear inch (for English
drawings) or newtons per millimeter (for metric drawings). Length is commonly
indicated (in position “L”) with a pitch (in position “P”) for intermittent welds or
without a pitch for a continuous weld. Alternatively, the extent of welded area
may be dimensioned.
Projection welds are specified like spot welds, but the basic weld symbol is
placed either above or below the reference line. The member indicated by the
arrow-side designation is embossed in preparation for the weld.
Flash and upset welds are specified by finish contour when applicable,
finishing method when applicable, and process specification.
Sheet Metal Prints
Sheet metal parts, like welded parts, may be manufactured in several stages. So
there are several different methods used to document the part requirements.
These are similar to the print methods used for welded parts: separate prints,
separate views, and composite prints.
A simple flat sheet metal strap guard is shown in Figure 12-18.
One additional method useful for sheet metal prints is to use a developed
(also called “flattened” or “unfolded”) drawing. Sheet metal parts containing
bends may be shown on the print in their finished state, in their bent state, or in a
developed state. Reading a developed print of a sheet metal part is no different
from reading a print of any other part. Because sheet metal has a constant stock
fitness, it may be shown using fewer views than more complicated parts,
possibly with the stock thickness called out in the title block material
requirement.

Figure 12-17 Projection, spot, and seam welds 

Figure 12-18 A drawing of a flat sheet metal part It may be helpful for you
to create your own developed working drawings of bent sheet metal parts
when developed drawings are not provided.
Developed Drawings
A developed drawing gives you information that you can directly apply to
process all the cut features prior to bending. A developed drawing of a limit
switch bracket that includes instructions for one bend is shown in Figure 12-19.
Some drawings show parts in both a flat form and a shaped form, especially
for complicated parts. A developed drawing of a part and the finished part can be
found in Figure 12-20.

Figure 12-19 A developed drawing with instructions for one 90-degree
bend 

Figure 12-20 Developed drawing and finished part Indications of Bends
Developed drawings with straight bends (typically accomplished using a press
break) are laid out using the largest planar surface of the part as the principal
view with all bends shown in the “up” direction. If the design of the part does
not allow this, then most bends are illustrated in the “up” direction. Figure 12-21
illustrates the bending operation on a press brake. Bends are indicated on the
drawing with a center line at the bend centerline and labeled CLB. The
annotation BUP indicates the part is bent up on this centerline, BDN indicates
the part is bent down on the centerline. The note also indicates the included
angle and internal bend radius, as shown in Figure 12-22.


Figure 12-21 Press brake bending operation 
Figure 12-22 Indications of straight bends using press brake Developed
drawings with curved bend lines formed using a rubber forming process
over a forming die are laid out using the largest planar surface of the part
as the principal view with all bends shown in the “down” direction. The
centerline may be shown at the Inside Mold Line (labeled IML) or at the
Form Block Line (labeled FBL). Figure 12-23 illustrates the bending
operation and terminology.

Figure 12-23 Rubber forming operation Creating Developed Drawings
To create a developed drawing, it is necessary to calculate the developed length
of the part through each of its bends; see Figure 12-24. The developed length
through a bend is the length of the unbent part that will result in the correct
dimensions after bending.
With the developed lengths calculated, the developed drawing can be
created. The front view is drawn with inside surfaces up. Then the projected
views are added to the front-view drawing, offset by a material allowance for the
bends. The right-side view is added to the right, left-side view added to the left,
etc. Auxiliary views are added at their appropriate auxiliary angles.
It should be noted that not all surfaces can be developed exactly. Flat
surfaces and singlecurved surfaces (like a cylinder) may be developed, but
double-curved surfaces (like a trumpet bell) cannot. These surfaces are formed
by stretch forming, deep drawing, spinning, or other methods.

Figure 12-24 Simple sheet metal bend Bend Deduction
One method of calculating the developed length is to use a bend deduction value
found in a bend deduction chart. The developed length is the length of the two
legs to the mold line, minus the bend deduction value found in the chart. One
bend deduction chart is shown in Table 12-8. It is used by finding the bend
deduction value at the intersection of the row containing the material thickness T
and the column containing the inner surface bend radius R. The developed
length is given by the formula:
Developed length = leg 1 + leg 2 - bend deduction Applying the formula
and chart to the 90-degree bend in Figure 12-24, we get: Developed
length = .75 + 1.25 - .081 = 1.919

Bend Allowance
Another method of calculating the developed length is to use a bend allowance,
calculated by formula or chart. The developed length is the length of the two
legs to the start of the bend, plus the bend allowance value found in the chart.
One bend allowance chart is shown in Table 12-9. It is used by finding the bend
allowance value at the intersection of the row containing the material thickness T
and the column containing the inner surface bend radius R. The developed
length is given by the formula: Developed length = leg 1 + leg 2 + bend
allowance Applying the formula to the 90-degree bend in Figure 12-24, we get:
Leg 1 = .75 − .09375 − .03125 = .625
Leg 2 = 1.25 − .09375 − .03125 = 1.125
Developed length = .625 + 1.125 + .169 = 1.919
Bend allowance can also be calculated by formula. For the bend in Figure
12-24, the allowance is given by the formula: Bend allowance = D × (.017453 ×
R + .007853 × T) Bend allowance = 90 × (.017453 × .09375 + .007853 ×
.03125) = .169346
In the formula, D is the bend angle in degrees, R is the bend radius on the
inner surface, and T is the stock thickness.
Using the bend allowance to calculate the developed length gives: Developed
length = .625 + 1.125 + .169346 = 1.919346
Note that bend deduction tables, bend allowance tables, and bend formulas
are all specific to the type of sheet metal used, and all give only approximations.
Actual bends may result in longer or shorter leg lengths and undesired locations
for other affected features.

Introduction
Gears are used to transmit mechanical power; they provide positive transmission
of power from one rotating shaft to another and determine speed, direction of
rotation, and torque or turning effort. They are made to industry standards
established by the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA).
Standard gears are available as catalog items from many manufacturers;
however, special gears may be designed for specific applications.
A spline is a term for a toothlike external form feature on a shaft or an
internal feature on a hub used for transmitting high amounts of torque between
coaxial shafts. Square tooth forms exist, but the involute tooth form (as used on
gears) is more common.
Cams are specialty parts that impart a predetermined motion to a rotating or
translating part called a “follower.” Cams are used throughout industry in
various types of machines to drive mechanisms both simple and complex.
Together, gears, splines, and cams represent specialty-type features whose
detailed geometry and tolerances do not appear fully on the print but are still
specified by reference from the print. Special manufacturing methods and
equipment are required that may be unavailable at the general machine shop,
requiring specialty suppliers.
Gears
Gears are efficient and dependable, and there are a wide variety of types; see
Figure 13-1. They are used for heavy-duty as well as light-duty applications and
for low-speed as well as high-speed drives. Gears are generally made of steel
and hardened to minimize wear, but they can also be made of cast iron, brass,
bronze, and other metals, and they can also be made of laminated phenolic and
several types of plastic.
Five different types of gears will be reviewed: spur, helical, bevel, spiral
bevel, and worm. The way gears are shown on prints and gear terminology will
be defined. This information will provide the basis for a better understanding for
reading gear prints.


Figure 13-1 Some of the different types of gears Spur Gears
Spur gears operate on parallel shafts and have straight teeth that are parallel to
the shaft axis, as in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2 Spur gears have straight teeth parallel to the shaft axis.
Terms and Definitions
In order to review gears, several terms must be defined. Gear teeth are specified
by their pressure angle, diametral pitch (or module), and number of teeth.
Diametral pitch, DP, refers to the size of English gear teeth. English gears are
listed or cataloged according to DP. Module, M, refers to the size of metric gear
teeth; see Figure 13-3. Standard diametral pitches are listed in Table 13-1 along
with their equivalent module. Standard modules are also listed with their
equivalent diametral pitch for comparison. Note that there are no standard
diametral pitches that are equivalent to any standard modules. Although English
and metric tooth forms are similar, they are not designed to be compatible.
Definitions for DP and other basic terms used for spur gears are shown in
Figure 13-4. Several of the terms also apply to other types of gears.

Figure 13-4 Terms and definitions used with spur gears  Pressure
angle: The angle between a tooth profile line and a radial line at the pitch
circle. The pressure angle is specified in the design of the gear. Mating
gears must have identical pressure angles and diametral pitches (or
modules). Most spur gears have pressure angles of 14.5, 20, or 25
degrees.
 Diametral pitch, DP: Used for English tooth forms, the number of teeth for
each inch of pitch circle. The diametral pitch determines the size of the gear
teeth. A larger diametral pitch means more teeth per inch, or smaller teeth.
 Module, M: Used for metric tooth forms instead of diametral pitch. The
module determines the size of the gear teeth, with units of millimeters. A
larger module means larger teeth; see Figure 13-3.
 Pitch circle: An imaginary circle centered on a gear’s axis that rolls without
slipping along the pitch circle of a mating gear; the basis upon which the gear
tooth geometry is defined.
 Circular pitch, CP: The distance between the centers of two adjacent teeth,
measured on the pitch circle.
 Pitch diameter, PD: The diameter of the pitch circle.
 Addendum, Ad: The radial distance between the pitch circle and the top of the
teeth.
 Dedendum, Dd: The radial distance between the pitch circle and the bottom of
the teeth.
 Outside diameter, OD: The diameter at the top of the teeth.
 Root diameter, RD: The diameter at the bottom of the teeth.
Spur Gear Formulas
There are many formulas that are used with gears; some of the basic ones used
for spur gears are shown in Table 13-2.
Example calculations are given for an English gear and a metric gear in
Table 13-2, and show the terms that can be calculated using a gear with 18 teeth
(N = 18). The English gear calculations are made for a gear with a diametrical
pitch of 6 (DP = 6), and the metric gear calculations are made for a gear with a
module of 4 (M = 4).
Helical Gears
Helical gears are similar to spur gears, but their teeth are angled with respect to
the shaft axis by an angle called the “helix angle.” Helix angles are typically 10
to 45 degrees and result in a gear being either left-handed or right-handed. Two
opposite-hand helical gears will form a gear mesh on parallel axes. Helical gear
teeth mesh with one another under a combination of rolling and sliding contact

starting at one end of the tooth and wiping across the tooth face before leaving
contact at the other side. Because they do not contact across the whole tooth face
instantaneously like spur gears, helical gears run more quietly than spur gears.
Figure 13-5 shows the basic geometry of helical gear teeth. The tooth form
lies in the normal plane designated by the section view, tilted to the gear’s axis
of rotation by the helix angle, HA. The tooth form is described by its geometry
in the normal plane using the normal module, Mn (or normal diametral pitch,
DPn), and normal pressure angle, PAn. The formulas for Pitch Diameter are
shown in Table 13-3, along with example calculations for a gear with 18 teeth (N
= 18) and Helix Angle of 45 degrees (HA = 45). The English gear calculations
are made for a gear with a normal diametrical pitch of 6 (DPn = 6), and the
metric gear calculations are made for a gear with a normal module of 4 (Mn =
4). The addendum, dedendum, outside diameter, root diameter, and normal
circular pitch are calculated using the same formulas used for spur gears, shown
in Table 13-2, using the normal diametral pitch (or normal module).

Figure 13-5 Terms and definitions used with helical gears Bevel Gears
Bevel gears are different from spur or helical gears in that their teeth are cut
from cones instead of cylinders. Their axes intersect at the common apex of the
two cones, called the “pitch cones.” These two axes are usually at 90 degrees,
but other angles are possible. While spur and helical gears can be thought of as
rolling without slipping against each other’s pitch circles, bevel gears transmit
motion by rolling on each other’s pitch cones.
The pitch diameter of a bevel gear is defined at the large end, on the back of
the pitch cone. The tooth size and shape are defined on the back cone and are
similar to a spur gear, as shown in Figure 13-6 along with other terms used with
bevel gears. The formulas for addendum and dedendum are the same as for spur
gears. Other formulas that are useful for cutting bevel gear teeth are shown in
Table 13-4. Note the pitch angle depends on the number of teeth on the mating

gear. Example calculations are given for an English gear and a metric gear with
32 teeth (N = 32). The English gear calculations are made for a gear with a
diametrical pitch of 6 (DP = 6), and the metric gear calculations are made for a
gear with a module of 4 (M = 4). Both gears use mating gears with 24 teeth.
Figure 13-6 Terms and definitions used with bevel gears Spiral Bevel
Gears
Spiral bevel gears are bevel gears whose teeth are cut at a helix angle around the
bore, like helical gears. They run more quietly than straight bevel gears and are

illustrated in Figure 13-7.
The pitch diameter of a spiral bevel gear is defined at the large end, on the
back of the pitch cone like a bevel gear. The tooth size and shape are defined on
the back cone, projected onto a normal plane and are similar to a helical gear, as
shown in Figure 13-7. The tooth form is tilted to the gear’s axis of rotation along
a spiral described by the mean spiral angle, SA, which is similar to the helix
angle of helical gears. The tooth form is described by its geometry in the normal
plane using the normal module, Mn (or normal diametral pitch, DPn), and
normal pressure angle, PAn.
Figure 13-7 Spiral bevel gears have teeth cut at a spiral to the cone axis.
Worm and Worm Gears
Wormsets connect parallel nonintersecting shafts and consist of two parts: the
worm gear (also called a “gear wheel”) and the worm (also called a “worm
screw”); see Figure 13-8. The shafts of the two parts are generally at 90 degrees,
but they may be canted. The worm is similar to a screw thread, with a small
number of teeth wrapped around a large helix angle. The terminology and

formulas for the gears are similar to those of spur gears. The worm is
characterized by several additional terms such as “pitch” and “lead angle.”
Wormsets can produce very large gear ratios and can be self-locking.

Gear Tooth Representation
Gear teeth may be shown realistically, as in the top gear of Figure 13-9. Gear
teeth, like thread forms, are standardized shapes and more commonly drawn in
schematic form, as in the bottom gear in Figure 13-9. The pitch circle is shown
as a center line and the addendum and root circles as phantom lines. Gear teeth
may be illustrated using a representative number of teeth realistically, the rest in
schematic form, as in the center gear of Figure 13-9.
Gear Data
Gear teeth are manufactured on specialty gear tooth-cutting equipment; minimal
information is needed on the print to specify the exact tooth form required. The
other features of the part, besides the tooth profile, will be fully illustrated,
dimensioned, and toleranced on the print following the techniques illustrated in
Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7.

The information required to specify the exact gear tooth required is found in
a data table on the print. A table for spur gear drawing data is shown in Figure
13-10. Data tables for helical, bevel, spiral bevel, and worm gears are shown in
Figures 13-11 through 13-14. The number of Xs represents the number of digits
typically displayed.
For metric gear teeth, the data provided on the drawing are similar, except
module is specified instead of diametral pitch. One fewer digit is typically
shown after the decimal point on dimensional data tables displaying millimeters.
The data tables displayed are typical, but additional data may also be given
on the print, such as base circle diameter, form diameter, pitch tolerance, profile
tolerance, and inspection measurement dimensions over pins or balls.

Many companies that use gears purchase them as standard commercial off-the-
shelf parts from gear manufacturers. As such, prints are not used by the
customer, and the manufacturer’s own prints are not shared outside the company.
Gears that are custom-designed to the customer’s specification may be
documented in prints made by the customer that show the nonstandard features
fully dimensioned and toleranced, with the tooth profile specified in a note or
table. Gears may also be made by modifying standard gears and documented as
altered commercial items or single-operation prints; see Chapter 14.
A print for manufacturing a spur gear is shown in Figure 13-15. Note the
table indicating pertinent data to specify the tooth profile. All other gear
information can be calculated from these data. The print shows all other
information, such as face width and size of bore.
A print for a bevel gear is shown in Figure 13-16.

Figure 13-15 A typical manufacturing drawing for a spur gear 

Figure 13-16 A typical manufacturing drawing for a bevel gear Splines
Involute spline tooth forms are standardized in ANSI B92.1 (for English forms)
and ANSI B92.2M (for metric forms); see Figure 13-17. Like screw threads and
gear teeth, the English forms and metric forms are not intended to be compatible,
even for similarly sized internal and external splines.
The involute tooth form is defined by the same terms used for gears: number
of teeth (N), module (M) or diametral pitch (DP), and pressure angle (PA). The
standard involute tooth spline has a pressure angle of 30, 37.5, or 45 degrees and
half the depth of a standard gear tooth. Standard splines have from 6 to 60 teeth

for pressure angles of 30 and 37.5 degrees, or they have up to 100 teeth for the
45-degree pressure angle. English tooth splines are designated by “pitch,” which
is two numbers: the diametral pitch and the stub pitch, which is always double
the diametral pitch (e.g., 16/32). Standard pitches are 2.5/5, 3/6, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12,
8/16, 10/20, 12/24, 16/32, 20/40, 24/48, 32/64, 40/80, 48/96, 64/128, 80/160, and
128/256. For metric forms, the standard modules are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5,
1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. Splines may have either a flat root or filleted
root.
Spline standards also define two types of tooth profile, side fit and major
diameter fit.
 Side fit: Internal and external tooth forms engage one another on the sides of
the teeth; the major and minor diameters are in clearance. This tooth form
provides less angular backlash between parts.
 Major diameter fit: The mating members contact the major diameters for
centralizing; the minor diameters are in clearance. The fit is a locational
clearance fit allowing for contact and location at the major diameters.
Spline teeth are available in four tolerance classes: 4 (tight), 5 (typical), 6
(loose), or 7 (looser).

Figure 13-17 Internal and external spline teeth with terminology Spline
Tooth Representation
Spline tooth forms are defined by standards, so like screw threads and gear teeth
they also are not drawn accurately nor dimensioned in detail. Drawings typically
represent spline teeth schematically: the pitch circle is shown as a center line and
the addendum and root circles as phantom lines. Prints then provide necessary
information to specify the exact profile through the use of a data table.
Spline Data
Spline teeth are manufactured on specialty tooth-cutting equipment; minimal
information is needed on the print to specify the exact tooth form required. The
other features of the part, besides the tooth profile, will be fully illustrated,
dimensioned, and toleranced on the print using the techniques illustrated in
Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7.
The information required to specify the exact involute spline teeth required
per ANSI B92.1 is found in a data table on the print. A table for an external
involute side fit tooth is shown in Figure 13-18. Tables for internal tooth side fit
and external and internal tooth major diameter fit splines are shown in Figures
13-19 through 13-21. The number of Xs represents the number of digits typically
displayed. For splines with root fillets, the minimum fillet radius will be
specified in the data table in addition to the other required information.
For metric involute spline teeth per ANSI B92.2M, the data provided on the
drawing are similar, except module is specified instead of pitch. One fewer digit
is typically shown after the decimal point on dimensional data tables displaying
millimeters.

A print for manufacturing a spline feature is shown in Figure 13-22. Note the

information can be calculated from these data. The print shows all other
information, such as tooth length, mating features, and type of material.
Cams
A cam is a simple mechanical part capable of producing complex

mathematically defined motion by virtue of its shape and interaction with
another component called the “follower.” Figure 13-23 illustrates the idea with
several radial plate cams and follower arrangements. Through simple rotary
motion of the cam while maintaining contact with the follower, the follower
reciprocates with a definite motion according to the shape of the cam profile.
Figure 13-22 A typical manufacturing drawing for a part with a spline 

Figure 13-23 Plate cams Cam Terminology
Some additional terms used in this text and in discussions of cams are shown in
Figure 13-24. A basic understanding of the following terms will help with
interpreting cam prints:  Cam profile: The physical surface of the cam in
contact with the follower  Base circle: The smallest circle centered at the cam’s
axis of rotation that can be drawn tangent to the cam profile  Pitch curve: The
path taken by the center of a roller follower around the cam  Prime circle: The

smallest circle centered at the cam’s axis of rotation that can be drawn tangent to
the pitch curve  Rise: The portion of the cam profile during which the follower
moves in the positive direction  Fall: The portion of the cam profile during
which the follower moves in the negative direction  Dwell: The portion of the
cam 
profile 
during 
which 
the 
follower 
does 
not 
move 
Figure 13-24 Cam terminology Types of Cams
There are a variety of cams in use by industry today. Cams are characterized by
the type of follower motion, the way the follower maintains contact with the
cam, the type of follower, and the type of motion used.
Follower motion can be oscillating (rotating or swinging) or translating
(sliding).
Followers maintain contact with the cam profile through an externally
applied force such as from a spring or pneumatic cylinder (forceclosed) or by

geometry (form-closed). An example of a form-closed follower joint is a
follower riding in a groove. Other form-closed styles are two roller followers
surrounding a rib, as in Figure 13-25, and conjugate cams.
Figure 13-25 Form-closed (rib) cam Followers may be flat, as the center
cam in the top row of Figure 13-23, and slide along the cam profile.
Button or crowned followers also slide along the cam profile and are used
to lift cylinder valves in automotive engines. Roller followers eliminate the
sliding wear by replacing sliding friction with rolling friction.
Cams have different ways of moving relative to the follower. Cams with
follower motion in a plane perpendicular to the axis of cam rotation are radial
cams, such as Figure 13-23, and are called “plate cams” when force-closed and
“groove cams” or “box cams” when formclosed.
When the follower moves parallel to the axis of cam rotation, the cam is an
axial cam. Axial cams are also called “face cams” when force-closed and
“cylindrical cams” or “barrel cams” when form-closed; see Figure 13-26. The
follower may translate parallel to the axis of the cam or rotate (or oscillate) in a
plane parallel to the axis of cam rotation. Figure 13-25 shows an axial cam with
a form-closed follower rotating in a plane parallel to the cam’s axis of rotation.
Cams with more complex motions (e.g., follower oscillating about an axis

skew to the cam’s axis) are called “globoidal cams.” Linear cams translate or
drive followers that translate along their profile instead of rotating.
Figure 13-26 Barrel cam Displacement Diagrams
The displacement of the follower is the primary consideration in the design of a
cam. A displacement diagram, sometimes called a “timing diagram,” is a graph
showing the displacement of the follower plotted against the position of the cam.
The cam’s position is described by its rotational angle labeled from 0 to 360
degrees, with the 0 degree origin and direction of rotation labeled on the
drawing. The segments of the cam motion are usually delineated. The follower
motion will be plotted realistically or schematically using straight lines, with
sufficient labels for the extents of motion as well as intermediate points when
necessary. Some displacement diagrams show the cam profile instead of the
follower displacement. Two cam displacement diagrams are given in Figures 13-
27 and 13-28.
The specific motion curves may be identified or not. Common motion curves
are simple harmonic, cycloidal, modified sine, modified trapezoid, double
harmonic, and polynomial.
Cam Prints
Like prints for gears and splines, cam prints will contain at a minimum those
views, dimensions, and tolerances to illustrate all the features of the part except

the cam profile. The cam profile may be shown as an exact profile (see Figure
13-29), or it may be shown as a simplified representation.
Figure 13-27 Cam displacement diagram 
Figure 13-28 Cam displacement diagram It is typical to see a
representation of the follower on the cam drawing. The follower is shown
with phantom lines in its proper assembled physical relationship to the
cam. The origin of the coordinate system and positive direc-tion(s) are
labeled. Figure 13-30 shows a print for a cam with oscillating follower.
A tabulated dimensioning scheme such as Figure 5-33 is typically not used
since an excessive number of points would be needed to define the cam profile
accurately enough. Instead, a well-labeled displacement diagram can enable
exact definition of the profile and manufacture of simple cams. The formulas for
the different follower motions are complex and beyond the scope of this text.

Furthermore, the calculations to determine the exact coordinates of the cam
profile from a displacement diagram are complicated, and different formulas are
used for each type of cam. Cam prints typically come associated with a CAD
data file, or at the very least, a tabulated numerical data file that can be imported
into a CNC machine tool for cutting the cam profile.

Introduction
Many different types of prints are used in industry. The type that is used most
often shows a drawing of one part and includes all the information to make the
part. Some of the other types of prints include assembly drawings, outline
drawings, layout drawings, interface drawings, and control drawings.
Some prints may be identified as certain types of drawings. An assembly
drawing may also be called a “final assembly drawing” or include the term
“subassembly” in its title. An installation drawing may include the words
“installation drawing” as part of its title. Many of the other types, however, may
not be identified as a specific type of drawing. An outline drawing may not have
the name “outline” anywhere on the print. Some parts may have the type as part
of the name of the drawing. Some types of drawings may be called by other
names; an outline drawing may be called an “envelope drawing” in some
organizations and industries. Because of these differences, strict definitions for
types of drawings will not be given. The purpose of each type of drawing is the
same as the purpose of all prints: prints must provide all the information that is
needed to manufacture or construct a product. Different types of drawings help
to illustrate different aspects of the manufacturing cycle, not merely component
fabrication and inspection; see Figure 1-2. The main purpose of this chapter is to
illustrate some of the different types of drawings and to show what they
generally look like. Only a brief review will be given for each type.
Many of the examples in this chapter are copies of industrial prints, and an
examination of these drawings will provide a general overview of typical prints.
Some of the items that are shown on some of the prints will be pointed out for
general information purposes.
Single Part
Sometimes referred to as a “detail” or “detail drawing,” single-part prints have
been the primary subject of the previous chapters of this book. The single-part
print includes all the information that is needed to manufacture the part. Prints
for three single parts are shown in Figures 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3.
Assembly
An assembly print contains a drawing showing more than one part. Although
assembly prints resemble single-part prints in many ways, their purpose is to
guide the assembly operation, not the fabrication operation.
Hidden lines are typically omitted from these prints. Details may also be

omitted if they are not necessary for the assembly operation. Assembly
instructions may be included in the notes or in a referenced external document.
Full section views are sometimes used to show hidden detail. Dimensions are not
included unless needed for the assembly operation.
A typical assembly print is shown in Figure 14-4; the figure shows a tube
connector that is made up of 10 parts. The print also indicates that the assembly
is to be tested per T.P.#1114, which is a separate testing instruction sheet
presumably provided by the company issuing the assembly print. Assembly
prints may have anywhere from two to hundreds of individual parts. Assemblies
may be either subassemblies or final assemblies.
The items required are labeled using find numbers corresponding to the
identifiers in the bill of materials or the item numbers. Some assembly prints do
not have a bill of materials directly on the print and instead use an associated list.
Figure 14-5 shows an assembly print for a float assembly.

Figure 14-1 Single part 
Figure 14-2 Single part 

Figure 14-3 Single part 
Figure 14-4 Assembly print of a tube connector 

Figure 14-5 A print of a float assembly Common
Common prints, sometimes called “composite prints” or “tabulated prints,” are
used to document design requirements for a family of parts on a single print.
Many commercial parts are available with the same shapes, in a range of sizes. A
common print of a T nut is shown in Figure 14-6, and a common print of a seal
is shown in Figure 14-7.
When referencing a member of a part family documented on a common
print, it is necessary to specify which component is needed. Components may be
referenced in bills of material or on assembly prints. This common print
provides an easy-to-use reference form that is convenient and saves space as
compared with a number of individual prints.

Figure 14-6 Common print 
Figure14-7 Common print of a seal Piping Diagrams
Piping drawings generally use symbols and single lines to represent installations

of pipes and related parts. Piping drawings may represent any type of pipe or
tubing. A piping drawing for a rinse trough is shown in Figure 14-8. Piping
drawings are often drawn in isometric form, as shown in Figure 14-8. This type
of layout provides simplified and easy-to-read instructions. Piping drawings are
also drawn in other forms. They may be shown in a flat form, or they may be
shown in the basic shape they form in the actual assembly. The purpose of a
piping drawing is to show the basic layout in a simplified form. The actual
piping arrangement may be different from the drawing because of obstacles, but
the basic layout must be according to the drawing. Piping drawings generally
show descriptions and part numbers for all component parts.
Circuit Diagrams
Circuit diagrams use symbols and single lines to represent electrical, hydraulic,
and pneumatic assemblies. Each type of circuit has its own symbols and
standards. The purpose of a circuit diagram is to show the basic function of an
assembly in a simplified form. The individual parts that are shown on a circuit
drawing may not be located as they are shown in the drawing. The parts are, of
course, physically connected according to the drawing. Circuit diagrams are also
called “circuit drawings,” “graphic diagrams,” and “schematics.” Examples of
electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic circuits are shown in Figure 14-9.

Figure 14-8 A typical piping drawing in isometric form 
Figure 14-9 Examples of electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic circuit

diagrams Installation
The purpose of an installation print is to show all the data that are needed to
install a part or an assembly relative to the supporting structure or adjacent
items. Installation drawings may indicate locating dimensions for mounting
hardware, travel of moving parts, clearances required, interfaces such as cabling
and piping, and weight information.
An installation print for a level control unit is shown in Figure 14-10. The
print shows overall dimensions as well as other basic data. Installation prints
generally show the way a unit is mounted or installed. Figure 14-10 shows the
level control unit mounted to a flange, which is shown as dashed lines. An
installation print may be used to fit a unit into existing assemblies, or it may be
used to engineer a part into new constructions.
Single Operation
Single-operation prints, also called “modifying prints,” show one part and one
manufacturing operation per sheet. The operation may be grinding, drilling,
painting, or any other task. The purpose of a single-operation print is to simplify
manufacturing instructions. The prints are easier to read and generally include
more detailed instructions than regular prints. Singleoperation prints are
generally used when large quantities of similar parts are manufactured. They are
also used for complicated machining operations or when close tolerances are
required.
A single-operation print is shown in Figure 14-11. A note in the upper left-
hand corner indicates one operation, which is to grind a .312-inch slot. The print
gives specific instructions to set up, grind, and inspect the part. Other operations
for the part are shown on additional sheets. The completed part is shown in
Figure 14-12. A single-operation print of a wire guide with instructions to make
a specific shaped hole is shown in Figure 14-13. The print refers to four separate
instruction sheets for additional manufacturing information.

Figure 14-13 A single-operation print of a wire guide Altered Item
An altered item print shows dimensions and tolerances that are to be achieved in
manufacturing through alteration of an existing part. The part may be a custom-
fabricated part, commercial component, or assembly. The original part’s
complete design definition is found on its own print, which may not be available
to the company performing the design activity resulting in the altered item. An
altered item gets its own unique item number, as it is now incompatible with the
original unaltered item.
Figure 14-14 shows an altered item print for a stud type cam follower. The
overall length has been shortened. Figure 14-15 shows an altered item print for a
timing belt pulley with nonstandard mounting features and lightening holes.

Figure 14-14 An altered item print 

Figure 14-15 An altered item print Outline
An outline print, also called an “envelope print,” shows overall dimensions as
well as basic technical information such as performance specifications. Outline
prints are generally used for commercial items to illustrate how the item fits into
a unit or assembly and to allow selection of the proper part, without revealing
proprietary design details. The print includes the amount of space required to
assemble the part. Mounting requirements are usually included on an outline
print.
An outline print for a push-button switch is shown in Figure 14-16. The
shape and size of a mounting hole for the switch in Figure 14-16 can be

determined from the print.
Figure 14-16 An outline print of a push-button switch Pictorial
A pictorial print is made in isometric form as though an assembly were taken
apart and the parts spread out in the order they were removed. Pictorial prints are
easy to visualize, and part numbers are easy to locate. Pictorial prints, sometimes
called “exploded prints,” are generally used in service or maintenance manuals.
A pictorial print of a clutch brake coupling is shown in Figure 14-17. Each
part is spaced so that it is easy to recognize. Each part or group of related parts is
identified with an item number. A separate chart shows additional information
for each item such as part number, description, and quantity. A pictorial print of
a flush valve is shown in Figure 14-18.

Figure 14-17 A pictorial print of a clutch brake coupling More Than One
Type
Prints may have more than one type of print on a single print. For example, a

print may include an electrical circuit and an assembly print. Since the purpose
of a print is to transmit specific information in an easy-to-understand manner, a
combination of print types can sometimes best suit this need. Any type and any
number of types can be used on one print.
Figure 14-19 shows a combination electrical circuit and assembly print for a
stator winding. Figure 14-20 shows an assembly print of a cap weldment with
references to specific welding and inspection procedures. The print also includes
overall reference dimensions. Figure 14-21 contains specific machining and
assembly requirements for a plunger assembly.

Layout
A layout print shows overall dimensions to guide the creation of other
engineering prints. Similar to a single-part, detail, or installation drawing, it
presents pictorial and dimensional information to the extent known at the time
the print is created or to the extent necessary to convey design requirements.
Layout drawings are prepared in the concept phase and allow detailed design to
take place.
Figure 4-22 shows a layout print of a section of automated assembly
equipment. From the basic arrangement of major systems illustrated in the layout
print, different engineering groups including different disciplines can begin
engineering activities to develop the detailed design of the equipment in
coordinated effort with one another.

Figure 14-22 Layout print Control
A control print, also called a “procurement drawing,” is used to purchase
interchangeable commercial items. Control prints contain dimensional and
performance criteria allowing for the purchase of commercials items without
specifying exact manufacturers and part numbers. Industries such as electronic
and industrial controls have many manufacturers producing components to
industry standards. A company using control prints to specify these components
frees their purchasing department from being tied to a single manufacturer and
specific off-the-shelf part number. Part suppliers may launch improved but
interchangeable parts, lower cost parts, discontinue parts, go out of business, or
temporarily run out of stock. Control prints allow flexibility to continue
purchasing parts that meet the requirements in spite of these changing

conditions, without involving the engineering department to make print
revisions.
Figure 14-23 shows a control print of a pillow block bearing. Mounting
dimensions and load capacity details are provided. Any bearing manufacturer
could produce a compatible item, provided it was compliant with the control
print requirements.
Figure 14-23 Control print Interface
An interface print shows the physical interface between assembled items to
establish and maintain compatibility between items having a common boundary.
An example is the pilot hole and bolt hole arrangement for mounting a motor.
Interface prints may depict a mechanical interface, such as a fastener pattern for
a mating part or an electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic interface.
Figure 14-24 shows an interface print for an electromechanical slide.
Drawing Tree
A drawing tree, sometimes called a “keying diagram,” is a block diagram

identifying all drawings belonging to a final assembly in a way that clearly
illustrates the parent-child relationships between prints. A drawing tree displays
all other prints and documents needed in pictorial form to show the relationship
of each print in the assembly structure. A drawing tree is typically redundant,
containing the same information as the bill of materials. Drawing trees are
nevertheless produced because their pictorial nature makes them easily
understandable.
Figure 14-25 shows a drawing tree for an electromechanical assembly.
