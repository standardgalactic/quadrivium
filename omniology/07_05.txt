Problem 7.5
Given 
 and 
, use the Fitch system to prove 
.
To apply a rule of inference, check the lines you wish to use as premises and click the button for the rule of
inference. Reiteration allows you to repeat an earlier item. To delete one or more lines from a proof, check
the desired lines and click Delete.
Whenever entering expressions, use Ascii characters only. Use ~ for  ; use & for ; use | for ; use =>
for 
; use A for ; use E for ; and use : for . in quantified sentences. Also, for variables use strings of
alphanumeric characters that begin with a capital letter. For example, to write the sentence
 , write AX:EY:(p(X)&q(Y)=>r(Y)|~s(Y)).
