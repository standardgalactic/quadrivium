Magic Methods
●
They are also called special or dander methods  ;
●
They are special or magic because you don't have to invoke them directly. The 
invocation is realized behind the scenes;
●
In fact there is a magic method for each operator like addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
raising to a power and so on;  
●
We can define these magic methods in our class to be able to add, subtract or multiply 
objects;
Exemples:
__init__() -> class constructor
__add__() -> addition operator (+)
__str__() -> called automatically when printing the object
__lt__() -> less than operator (<)
__gt__() -> greater than operator (>)
