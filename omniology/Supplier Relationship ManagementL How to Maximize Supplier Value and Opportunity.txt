Procurement 
Success vs. 
SRM Failure
The Rise of Procurement
Let us be clear about one thing right from the start. This is not another 
book bashing procurement and calling out its allegedly many and obvi-
ous shortcomings. Over the past 20 years, procurement has made lots 
of great strides. A. T. Kearney’s periodic study Assessment of Excellence 
in Procurement (AEP) speaks a clear language. Across industries and at a 
global level, procurement functions are in a pretty good shape.
Today, most companies do have a chief procurement officer (CPO) who 
has earned a seat at the table with his or her peers from innovation, 
production, marketing, sales, and finance. Given the high degree of focus 
on core competencies that can be observed consistently across indus-
tries, outsourcing of significant elements of the value chain has become 
the norm rather than the exception. This trend, more than anything, has 
fuelled what could be labeled as “the rise of the CPO.” Strategic decisions 
about which product market segments to address and where and how to 
make products are driven rather than just supported by today’s CPOs. 
And this modern CPO is more likely to overstress the term customer 
value than the term cost savings.

At the same time, functional silos have crumbled to ruins. Walk the cor-
ridors of any leading company and you are likely to see cross-functional 
teams working on key initiatives. Today’s procurement executives are as 
eloquent in engineering and marketing language as their counterparts 
in the other functions are fluent in the language of sourcing strategies. 
The age-old tactic of suppliers playing functional managers against pro-
curement people has largely lost its value and might even backfire on 
the suppliers.
Also, pounding the table has ceased to be the preferred sourcing strat-
egy. Today’s procurement teams are working with a host of differentiated 
strategies that are selected based on the company’s demand power and 
the supplier’s supply power. The resulting strategies exceed the traditional 
remit of procurement by far and pull in substantial competencies from 
engineering, manufacturing, IT, and supply chain management. They even 
encourage procurement people to think and act as entrepreneurs. A sig-
nificant subset of the authors of this book hopes to have contributed to 
this trend with the creation of the Purchasing Chessboard.1 This chess-
board provides 64 techniques for buyers to reduce cost and increase 
value from category sourcing. These techniques are chosen depending on 
the balance between supply and demand power.
Managing operational processes has become a highly standardized topic. 
Today, no leading company worries about procure-to-pay processes. There 
is no more guessing and reinventing the wheel in these areas; there is just 
one right way to do it. The same is true for procurement information 
systems. After albeit huge investments, it has become the norm to press a 
key and get accurate information on who buys what from which supplier.
Procurement performance management is something of an exception, as 
it has seen more action recently. The advent of the financial ratio ROSMA 
(return on supply management assets) provides a way for procurement 
performance to be discussed in CFO-friendly terms. ROSMA provides 
the basis for gauging the financial performance of procurement with one 
single key performance indicator (KPI) and for managing the performance 
of procurement teams.

Supplier Relationship Management

With procurement organizations increasingly hiring talent over experience, 
procurement has become the intellectual hotbed for many companies. 
Droves of former management consultants and investment bankers team 
up with engineering, manufacturing, and marketing experts to overwhelm 
suppliers with data, facts, and analyses. Procurement people spend an 
increasing amount of time in internal academies and the senior executives 
leverage the advice of external coaches to help them perform better.
Everything Is Rosy, Then?
If everything was rosy, this would be a very short book and we could 
pack up and go home now. The one open issue we would like to point 
out is the inability of procurement executives to manage suppliers rather 
than categories. Most of the good things previously highlighted are totally 
category focused:
The decisions on which product market segments to 
• 
serve and where to produce goods are driven at a 
product or category level.
Cross-functional teams working on the next hot 
• 
products focus on categories and not on suppliers.
All sourcing strategy development by definition is 
• 
category-centric and not supplier-centric.
Procurement performance management focuses on 
• 
savings by category and product but hardly ever on 
the savings or value contributed by suppliers.
And last, the talent recruited into procurement 
• 
focuses on better understanding products and cat-
egories but hardly ever on managing suppliers.
Again, we are not advocating for stepping back on any of these points. 
Instead, we’d like to focus on the one important element that’s missing. 
What we hear consistently from suppliers working with large custom-
ers are complaints about how hard it is to work with them. Suppliers 
are likely to get conflicting messages when working across business units 
(BUs). For example, one of us recalls the case of a machining supplier 
for a major aerospace business that constantly received mixed messages 
on how acceptable its quality and price performance were. Because the 
messages were not consistent, the supplier did not act. Then, one day the 
customer made the corporate decision to move business away lock, stock, 
and barrel. It gave the supplier no real opportunity to respond. This led 
directly to job losses and near closure of the affected plant.

Chapter 1 | Procurement Success vs. SRM Failure
4
All of us have also seen the curious case of one BU phasing out a supplier 
because it is unhappy with the overall performance of that supplier while 
another BU is increasing business with the very same supplier. Individually, 
there may be good reasons for that dichotomy, but in the grand scheme 
of things, this sends a very confusing message to the supplier.
The same lack of alignment can be observed across functions. Engineering 
may believe that a certain supplier is the greatest of all because it comes 
up with breakthrough technologies that will make a difference in the mar-
ket. At the same time, manufacturing and supply chain managers may loath 
this specific supplier because it consistently fails in ramping up production 
and causes horrific quality problems. Again, all of us have seen suppliers 
that, despite disappointing day-to-day performance, get awarded with sub-
stantial new business.
Even worse is the frequent misalignment across hierarchy levels. Too many 
CEOs lack the time and discipline to ask for a thorough briefing before 
meeting a supplier. This sometimes leads to high-level conversations that 
only take place at the level of pure “relationship building” between indi-
viduals, without substantive content. Such a result at least does not cause 
harm. Far worse, lack of briefing can lead to agreements being made, or 
perceived to having been made, with a supplier that are completely coun-
ter to the real needs of the customer. We have all heard of examples 
where suppliers try to get CEOs to agree to things that look fine at a high 
level but that at a more detailed level would be soundly rejected. At the 
very least, what could be a fantastic opportunity to emphasize a message 
to a supplier becomes another cause of confusion that neither benefits 
the company nor the supplier.
Key Account Management vs. SRM
Let us repeat the observation that suppliers regard the internal misalign-
ment of their customers as a problem rather than an opportunity. The 
conflicting messages they receive result in wasted effort for the supplier. 
Granted, some suppliers do cynically try to play “divide and rule.” But, this 
is usually acquired or socialized behavior in response to the misalignment 
of the customer. A supplier is usually far happier if it can understand what 
the customer really expects with the minimum of effort.
Even the sophisticated key account-management routines that many sup-
pliers have deployed fail to be a reliable remedy. After all, what good does 
it do to be very close to the key decision makers of your customer if 
they can’t agree among themselves? A professional supplier will point out 
these inconsistencies to his customer to the degree that politeness per-
mits. But there are limits to the extent of feedback a customer can digest, 
and too often, the supplier will have to cope with the fallout.

Therefore, we hear the suppliers’ cry for supplier relationship manage-
ment, or SRM. Professional suppliers prefer to work with customers who 
are aligned internally. 
The Prize
What is SRM? While category management is all about the price of a 
product or service, SRM is about working more effectively with suppliers 
to deliver benefits. It recognizes that both parties need to achieve their 
goals. Today, SRM is instead often little more than the sum of all category 
management activities and infrequent executive-level meetings and hoping 
for the best.
Imagine the benefit companies could reap from opening up an additional 
dimension of management that deals with the following questions:
At a company level, what do we want from this 
• 
supplier?
What type of behavior do we want to drive with this 
• 
supplier?
How do we want to structure the relationship with 
• 
this supplier?
How do we ensure we are aligned internally when 
• 
dealing with this supplier?
What are the appropriate tools and models for man-
• 
aging the interaction with this supplier?
These are crucial questions that all organizations can benefit from answer-
ing. We strongly believe that accessing the power of supplier relationships 
is a big untapped opportunity in so many businesses.
This Book Is Not About Procurement  
(At Least Not Only)
By now, it should have become clear that this book is not about procure-
ment. Procurement, on its own, cannot answer any of the previous ques-
tions sufficiently. SRM is a cross-functional, top-management responsibility. 
As we’ll see, the role of procurement is to orchestrate SRM and to lead 
the introduction of SRM in a company.

Introducing SRM in this way to a company is the key to unlocking major 
opportunities. In this book, we seek to shed light on how to do this. In the 
next chapter, we introduce the approach of TrueSRM—a fully holistic way 
for driving supplier behavior. In subsequent chapters, we talk about different 
types of supplier relationships, how to apply TrueSRM to these differentiated 
suppliers, and the key factors for success. We then circle back to discuss 
the future outlook for supplier management and how it applies to differ-
ent industries. Along the way, we use a number of case studies from our 
own experiences as well as some from our colleagues and clients.
To illuminate and support the messages, we also reintroduce the story 
of the fictional characters from the novel The CPO, which three of us 
cowrote.2

Relationship 
Management 
A Myth?
SRM is a frequently used term that most businesspeople have heard of 
and recognize. It has its own Wikipedia entry. A recent search on Amazon 
revealed nearly 1,700 published books related to the topic. There are 
courses, seminars, and even Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system 
modules that are focused on it, too. Discussions with CPOs who have 
pursued strategic sourcing rigorously tend very quickly to move onto SRM 
as the “next big thing” for getting value. Procurement organizations typically 
have personnel and even whole departments devoted to implementing or 
driving SRM. People even make their careers as “SRM specialists.”
Seemingly, everyone agrees that we need to have SRM.

What Is Strategic Sourcing?
■
■
  Strategic sourcing is a structured, systematic process 
for reducing the total costs of externally purchased materials, goods, and services while 
maintaining/improving levels of quality, service, and technology. The objective is to meet the 
company’s business requirements from external supply markets. This is done most effectively 
by intervening in external supply markets in a way that takes account of the relative strength of 
demand power and supply power. Strategic sourcing most decidedly is not concerned explicitly 
with how a business manages its relationships with suppliers—that is the realm of SRM.
But, What Does It Mean?
For something that creates so much buzz, SRM is a remarkably slippery 
topic to put one’s fingers on. The very meaning of the term is unclear.
Most people can describe some of the things that are associated with 
SRM practices—the “trappings” as it were. Many companies implement 
these trappings. It is rare now to talk to a CPO who does not have:
Some form of understanding in place that differen-
• 
tiates suppliers as strategic, critical, and tactical, or 
other similar adjectives. This is referred to as supplier 
segmentation.
Some concept of 
• 
partnership or collaboration with 
specific suppliers—usually focused, of course, on the 
strategic or critical ones. 
A regime of account review meetings and perfor-
• 
mance scorecards for selected suppliers—again,  
usually focused on the strategic or critical ones.
The problem: Many people get hung up on these trappings as a description 
of what SRM is and miss the bigger picture of what actually needs to be 
achieved. We see countless examples of SRM programs that are focused 
on combinations of process design, tools, and broad concepts of supplier 
collaboration. All of these things have a place and can be useful, but they 
often miss the fundamental point that, to be effective, the behaviors of 
both the customer and the supplier will need to change.

The Problems
The failure to recognize this leads to a number of serious issues for 
businesses:
Big investment in processes and procedures, without 
• 
sufficient focus on the necessary outcomes
A view that SRM is a “procurement topic” that “belongs” 
• 
only to the CPO, to the detriment of the organization
A silo-based approach with an inability to join up the 
• 
organization’s perspectives on suppliers, often leading 
to counterproductive messages
The net result of this is bad outcomes for both the customer and its 
suppliers.
Let’s ponder for a moment. Think of yourself as a supplier to an organization 
that has gone down this road of implementing a “traditional” SRM program.
On the one hand, you may feel that this is wonderful. The business uses 
the language of “partnership” and probably invites you to a range of  
“summits” and “review” meetings where you are able to meet senior 
executives. Occasionally, you also get asked to fill in a “voice of the supplier”  
survey, which you are told is anonymous. You even get invited to give 
face-to-face “feedback” on how things are going. You clearly realize that 
you are expected to feel valued and that, possibly, your ideas for how you 
can contribute more to the customer’s business are even valued too.
On the other hand, there is also a sense of artificiality in the air. Although 
you are asked to see yourself as a “partner,” the deep underlying behaviors 
do not change. You still have to win work constantly via tenders, and you 
are still managed predominantly through compliance to contract. There 
are also more forms to fill in with respect to performance reporting and 
scorecards. Deep-rooted customer behavior does not seem in fact to be 
so very different. You pause before giving honest face-to-face feedback; 
deep down, you even doubt that the voice of the supplier survey that 
takes so much effort is really anonymous. You hesitate from being truly 
honest when you complete it. You also notice that the organization is still 
completely unable to speak with one voice on its needs and requirements. 
This is despite all the paraphernalia that has been put in place. You revert 
to form. You continue to play “divide and rule” in your dealings with the 
customer. You rationalize this as the only way you can possibly succeed 
with the customer. You may even be right.
For the customer, this whole cycle has been utterly self-defeating. A con-
siderable amount of effort has been invested. The result has been that 
behaviors are unchanged, or, worse, are even more dysfunctional than 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 | Supplier Relationship Management 
10
they were previously. The organization still fails to manage supplier rela-
tionships in the round. Suppliers end up confused about what is wanted 
and do not deliver to the best of their ability. Instead, they are encouraged 
to “game” the organization and play divide and rule whenever they can. 
Suppliers who could bring crucial innovation opportunities to their cus-
tomer’s attention fail to do so. The customer has misapplied the “partner-
ship” term to include nearly all big suppliers, even those who cannot really 
bring access to competitive advantage. The suppliers who have potential 
to be “true partners” have been ignored and everyone has been ground 
down by a need to follow “procedure.” Account-review meetings have 
become contract-performance discussions and the segmentation matrix 
has not moved far beyond being a pure theoretical concept.
There is a need to break this cycle. The organization has implemented 
procedural SRM. It has not put in place what we describe as TrueSRM. 
TrueSRM is what is needed. We will now consider what SRM should 
really be about.
CASE: AUTOMAKERS IN THE MID-1990S
A case example illustrates the downside of too much, or the wrong kind of, 
partnership. In the mid-1990s, one of the world’s most prestigious carmakers had 
discovered the importance of SRM for itself. The implicit understanding was that 
something needed to be done beyond having annual negotiations with suppliers. 
After analyzing what went well and what did not, the relationships with several 
high-end suppliers were identified as best practice.
Some of these high-end suppliers had been working with the carmaker for more 
than 90 years and over that period had provided many crucial innovations. The 
idea then was to bring all other suppliers up to the level of those key suppliers.  
A comprehensive SRM program was introduced and given a name that resonated 
well. Since many of those who were involved in the program are still around, we 
cannot disclose its real name in this book, but let’s call it “Program Handshake” 
going forward.
Program Handshake was kicked off during a large supplier day with the CPO and 
several board members giving inspiring speeches. The new way of working was 
outlined to suppliers in booklets describing the new partnership type of approach. 
Suppliers who agreed to these principles were then called Handshake suppliers. 
After a very short ramp-up period, 1,500 direct material suppliers had signed up as 
Handshake suppliers. They represented nearly all of the carmaker’s direct material 
spending.
The CPO lived and breathed Handshake. He was talking about Handshake 
wherever he went, both in internal and in external meetings. There even was an 
elaborate sculpture of two shaking hands on his conference table.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
11
But the deeper he got into Handshake, the more difficult things got. The achievement 
of the required cost-reduction targets stalled. Whenever a supplier was challenged 
on cost, his response would be “This demand to cut price is against the principles 
of Handshake.” To make matters worse, even the innovation performance dropped. 
The long-term, high-end suppliers continued doing what they had been doing all 
along, but the hundreds of other suppliers actually showed fewer innovations than 
prior to the introduction of Handshake.
What had happened was that suppliers in Handshake became complacent. 
Handshake effectively pulled the teeth out of strategic sourcing, and suppliers 
did not feel competitive threats anymore. Privately, supplier executives admitted 
overcharging the carmaker by up to 50 percent compared to other carmakers.
So, What Is TrueSRM Really About?
We take a holistic view that SRM encompasses all interactions between 
the customer and the supplier. At its heart, SRM:
Drives supplier behavior
• 
Encompasses the relationship between two enterprises
• 
Enables a company to leverage its size by coordinat-
• 
ing across divisions, functions, and hierarchies
This seemingly innocuous but broad-reaching definition means that SRM 
is about both top-line and bottom-line goals that encompass innovation, 
risk, and cost, as well as quality and responsiveness. The trappings of SRM 
can only be implemented and considered in terms of how they contribute 
to this overall goal.
A company that is applying SRM in this highly holistic way is following 
TrueSRM. Even today, very few organizations take this approach systemati-
cally across their full external supply base.
TrueSRM Does Not Vary by  
Industry/Business
Given the holistic nature of TrueSRM, one might argue that an attempt to 
describe how to execute it can only be meaningful on a pure industry-by-
industry basis. There is some rationale in this. Clearly, the precise needs 
from the overall supply base will vary by industry and for each firm within 
the industry. Industries vary in the precise opportunity for suppliers to 
bring innovation, for example, or in the precise definition of risk. A chemi-
cals company will have different objectives in these fields from a bank with 
quite different weightings. Different firms in the same industry will vary 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 | Supplier Relationship Management 
12
in things like the degree to which they outsource/insource activities. This 
will also have impacts on the precise needs they have from suppliers.
However, the fundamental nature of TrueSRM does not vary across indus-
try or firms. The end requirement is the same. The precise trappings will 
vary but the thought process and key needs will not change. Indeed, there 
are major lessons to be learned by exchanging “best of breed” practices 
across different industries.
The Challenge
In effect, we feel that SRM today resembles strategic sourcing in the late 
1980s. This was before the concept was invented and properly codified. 
Organizations designed specifications, issued tenders, negotiated with sup-
pliers, and signed contracts. On occasion, they did these things very well 
and even achieved strong benefits from doing so. But, rather like an animal 
that acts from pure instinct, there was limited ability to repeat successful 
approaches systematically across an organization. Selecting different levers 
for benefit was based more on “gut feel” than on analysis or science.
The codification of strategic sourcing that started with A. T. Kearney’s work 
in the automotive industry changed all this. Initially, a bit like with SRM today, 
people argued that strategic sourcing could not be applied to all industries 
or categories. We now know that to be false and the growth of the influ-
ence of procurement functions in the past 20 years has been strongly asso-
ciated with the rollout of strategic sourcing beyond its automotive origins.
Where TrueSRM has been put in place, often in parts of businesses, the 
results have been very good. We are sure that, like us, most readers are famil-
iar with excellent examples of suppliers and customers working together 
to drive operational improvement and create joint innovation. This is often 
driven by a particular working relationship that has been created, some-
times by chance. When this happens, the results are great. But it tends to 
happen in isolated circumstances, and is rarely systematic. Organizations 
that achieve these great results in one part of their supply base often still 
experience major issues elsewhere. The “secret sauce” is not codified.
Today’s challenge for procurement is to orchestrate precisely this pro-
cess by building on the great success that has already been achieved from 
strategic sourcing. The challenge is to manage supplier interactions on the 
same systematic basis that already applies to strategic sourcing. Doing so 
has the potential to release immeasurable value that will go far beyond 
mere cost saving.
This book is intended to be the guide for putting TrueSRM in place. In the 
next chapter, we will introduce a case study for doing this in practice.

and Beyond!
Initiating SRM in the Real World
Before we get to the core of the SRM framework we propose, let us take 
a look at a case study for inspiration. During the rest of this book, we 
will use the fictional example of Heartland Consolidated Industries to 
illustrate the points made in the main text. Let’s say that Heartland is a 
global food products business headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The 
recently appointed CEO is a German-American named Thomas Sutter. 
Unusually, his prior role was as the chief procurement officer and he has 
owed his elevation to the success he achieved in that position. Prior to 
Heartland, Thomas worked for several years at Autowerke, the leading 
German carmaker.
Under Thomas as the CPO, the business had gone a long way toward 
implementing best practice procurement. He successfully imported many 
of the good practices that his previous company already had in place. 
Procurement in Heartland has become incredibly successful at meeting 
the perceived needs of the business, owing to its laser-like focus on reduc-
ing external costs. The external effectiveness of the function of dealing 
with external suppliers as well as its internal effectiveness in dealing with 
the wider Heartland organization has been significantly enhanced in an 
approach known as Holistic Procurement Transformation. As part of this 
approach, strategic sourcing has also been put in place systematically, and 
ROSMA, the overall return on supply management assets, is tracked and 
managed.

Laura Braida, an Italian businessperson from Milan, is the CPO now. She 
achieved the first key breakthrough results in the strategic sourcing pro-
gram that Thomas launched when he joined Heartland. Unusual for a 
procurement professional, Laura has a PhD in mathematics, which she had 
put to good effect in the analysis that drove her strategic sourcing sav-
ings. Other key executives in our story include Garner, the CFO; Rick, the 
COO; and Scarlet, the CMO.

  Astute readers may have noticed that some of the same characters appear in  
The CPO (Apress, 2012), cowritten by a number of the authors here. This book offers the 
backstory on these characters and the turnaround they engineered at Heartland. You can find 
out more information about the book at http://www.apress.com/9781430249627.
Trouble Brewing
When Thomas had been in his new role as CEO at Heartland 
for six months, he felt that he had fully settled into his role now. 
The inheritance from his predecessor, Ross, was a good one; 
the executive team was effective and the business largely in 
sound shape. Thomas now had his mind predominantly on how 
to grow. He felt he had largely left the cares of procurement 
behind, in the hands of Laura. Then, one day, Emma Jenkins, 
the head of investor relations, appeared in his office’s anteroom 
and told Natalie, his executive assistant, that she had to see him 
as soon as possible.
Emma was immediately let into the office. Thomas was aware 
that Emma’s role meant she often had external conversations 
with investors and stakeholders. Frequently, she needed to update 
him quickly so that he could return a call or have a conversation. 
However, this was different.
“Thomas, we had a call this morning from a researcher with the 
Corporate Responsibility Awareness Group. He says they have 
strong evidence that one of our packaging suppliers in Sri Lanka 
is using child labor. They are forcing children as young as eight 
to work 10 hours a day.”
“Seriously?” asked Thomas.
“Yes. They wanted to give us a chance to comment. But the 
story is about to break. I am sure it will quickly go viral. I could 
not really offer a comment.”

“OK. Not much you can do. I would talk to Laura so she knows. 
We need to find out what is happening at that supplier. I had 
been meaning to introduce more rigorous supplier audits when  
I was CPO, but it was not the number-one priority.”
What became known as the Heartland Child Labor Scandal did 
go viral. No local laws had in fact been broken, but the adverse 
publicity hurt the company’s stock price and considerable 
management attention was diverted to dealing with the issue. 
More importantly, Thomas saw himself as an ethical individual 
and genuinely wanted Heartland to operate under the same 
principles. He was personally upset with what had happened.
But the litany of supplier problems in what he would later call 
the month of mayhem was not over. Two weeks later, after 
the storm from the child labor scandal seemed to be passing, 
Thomas received an urgent e-mail from Rick Fiore, the chief 
operating officer, copied to Laura. A small subsupplier of a key 
ingredient made in Poland had suddenly stopped deliveries. The 
ingredient concerned was a unique flavor, which had been a 
major innovation for Heartland’s yogurt range. It seemed that 
the subsupplier was having financial difficulties and one of its 
own suppliers, much bigger than it was, had stopped supplying 
essential inputs as a response to not being paid.
Clearly, Heartland had not been close enough to events in its 
supply chain. On further inquiry, it transpired that the company 
that had stopped deliveries to the Polish supplier was also a very 
significant direct supplier to Heartland elsewhere in its supply 
chain. This made the situation far more galling. The situation 
was rectified by the procurement, finance, and production 
teams working together to get the deliveries resumed in crisis 
management mode. Ultimately, only two days of production 
were lost, and the European supermarket customers saw only 
a blip in stock availability—but enough that several customers 
demanded, and received, large rebates.
Thomas now felt that perhaps there was a more systematic issue 
that needed resolution. He wondered if Heartland was really close 
enough to its suppliers. His feelings were prompted to action by 
receiving a third piece of news. At the end of the month, he 
was in his office just after 7 a.m. An early morning meeting had 
been scheduled with Laura to debrief on how the recent supplier 
problems would be avoided in future. Thomas quickly opened 
his iPad to check on the morning’s news. To his amazement,

the following headline flew across the financial section: “Calbury

innovation in conjunction with Marshfield Packaging.”
The detailed article explained that the new packaging for the 
products kept the food fresher and tasting good for longer. 
The company’s launch was imminent. Calbury had cofunded 
development and contributed expertise. Accordingly, it had 
exclusivity to the product for what looked like a two-year 
period. It looked like this would be the initiation of a more wide-
ranging strategic partnership, and Thomas realized that this was 
a major competitive disadvantage for Heartland. To his chagrin, 
Marshfield was also a supplier to Heartland.
Laura walked into the office for the meeting. “What’s 
happening?” Thomas said. “Have you seen the Calbury and 
Marshfield tie-up?”
“Yes,” she answered. “I think this proves what we have been 
discussing. We need to get much more systematic in how we 
manage our supplier relationships, both to avoid risk and to add 
more value.”
Laura sat down and put her laptop on the edge of Thomas’s 
desk. “I think we need to drive SRM, Thomas. It’s something 
I can orchestrate but it really needs to be owned more broadly.” 
She opened up her laptop and said, “I have a short slide deck. Do 
you have a minute to . . . ?”
Thomas stopped her. “Please, Laura, not an SRM program.” 
He said “program” very slowly and dwelled over the syllables. 
“SRM programs rarely achieve much,” he said. “I saw all this at 
Autowerke. They were just a way to get more discounts, really.”
She agreed. “Most CPOs have done ‘something’ they label 
as SRM but without a consistent, compelling view on the 
business objective of SRM and what should be included in a 
SRM capability. As a result, many of these companies fail to 
fully channel the energy of their supply base for competitive 
advantage. What we need is what I would call TrueSRM as 
opposed to only a set of processes and procedures.”
Despite the dramas of the past couple of weeks, Laura clearly 
saw an opportunity. She envisioned that procurement would 
become far more of a strategic function for the business than 
it currently was. She explained that this would need to be

achieved by working closely with the executives to collectively 
make progress in the company’s three to five year strategic 
plan with a comprehensive SRM capability aimed at building a 
sustainable competitive advantage. Done that way, she said, SRM  
would work.
Rather than spell out all the details of the program, Laura had a 
simple “ask” for Thomas. She wanted to run workshops with the 
executive team to chart the journey toward SRM.
“Thomas, I can orchestrate SRM. But if I try to determine 
everything within procurement, it won’t work.”
“What will the workshops look like?” asked Thomas.
“The objective would be to come up with answers to five 
beautifully simple questions.”
She pointed to a slide on her screen that read: “What is SRM? 
Why do SRM? Why do SRM now? What does it take to build 
a leading SRM capability? What is the best way to get started?”
Thomas relented. “OK, Laura, let’s give it a go.”
But she had one further request: “Thomas, you need to be the 
executive sponsor. This must be owned from the top. It is simply 
too important not to be.”
Thomas was a little concerned that this would potentially pull him 
back into procurement and overshadow Laura’s role. However, 
he saw the logic. The three issues of the month of mayhem really 
were a mission critical for the business. If Heartland could head 
off such debacles . . . .
He agreed. Over the following couple of weeks, a series of 
workshops addressed Laura’s five questions one by one. Thomas 
attended each session and Laura chaired them. Rick, the COO; 
Garner, the CFO; and Scarlet, the CMO, were also present. 
Each workshop addressed one question and was scheduled to 
last one-and-a-half hours at the end of the day—a good moment 
for reflective discussion in the Heartland culture. Thought was 
given to just holding a single all-day session to attack all five 
questions. However, it was felt that shorter sessions over a period 
with the opportunity for participants to reflect would achieve a 
much better outcome. It would also make scheduling easier.

The First Workshop
On a Tuesday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., all of the executives filed 
into a meeting room to tackle the first question, What is SRM?
Laura started the session: “Maybe the best way to start this,” 
she said, “is if we all give an initial view of what we think SRM 
is.” This seemingly innocuous question actually turned out to 
be very hard to answer. There were quite different views in the 
room.
Garner started: “For me, it is about making sure that suppliers 
perform and do not let us down.” Scarlet nodded in agreement 
and added, “It’s also about making sure that we mitigate any 
risks we have from external suppliers.” The child labor issue in 
Sri Lanka was still very much on her mind, but she did not want 
to refer to it directly; the experience had been too painful for all 
concerned.
“OK,” said Laura. “So, SRM needs to include performance 
and risk management.” She captured those points on the 
whiteboard.
“What you do with suppliers somehow needs to be differentiated 
too,” said Rick. “We would not want to manage performance 
and risk as rigorously for a stationery supplier as we would for a 
supplier from which we get core ingredients.”
Laura interjected: “This is what in procurement we talk about as 
segmentation of the supply base. We use that as a basis to treat 
different types of suppliers differently.” She wrote “Supplier 
segmentation” on the whiteboard.
Thomas now spoke up: “It’s also about making sure that we are 
coordinated. We need to be able to speak as a single voice to 
suppliers. That way, they know where they stand and no supplier 
will be tempted to play “divide and rule” with us. It’s hard to do 
given that we are big and global, but that understanding must be 
part of this.”
They all nodded. Laura noted the point. They now had three 
definitions on the whiteboard:
—Performance and risk management
—Supplier segmentation
—Coordinated supplier communication across all business units, 
functions, and hierarchy levels.

Supplier Relationship Management

“Is that all?” asked Laura.
“No,” said Scarlet. “Those are good foundations. But I think it is 
really about more than that. I want to work with suppliers to get 
more out of the relationships. That goes beyond pure performance 
management or making sure the contract is delivered. For 
example, from the creative agency I want the absolute A Team 
to give us the best marketing ideas that we can develop. I want 
more value. I want innovation.”
“Do you want innovation from every supplier?” inquired 
Laura.
“Well, I suppose the politically correct answer is to say yes,” 
said Scarlet. “But, in reality, as a business, it is not always 
so critical to get that from every supplier, nor is it a realistic 
desire. From our suppliers of printed materials, I really just need  
on-time delivery and a hardworking response to our specifications 
each time.”
“So, there are strategic elements to SRM that do not apply to 
every supplier,” said Laura.
“When we talk about suppliers who are really valuable,” said 
Thomas, “we will also be thinking about how we can work 
with them to create ecosystems that give us a competitive 
advantage. But that will be with a handful of suppliers at most, 
I would say.”
“So, the strategic elements only apply to select suppliers based 
on the segmentation we just discussed,” said Laura. Then, she 
wrote on the whiteboard:
—Improvement initiatives that go beyond current contractual 
commitments
—Value maximization across the ecosystem
“We have five key points,” she said. “Three foundational aspects 
apply to all suppliers and then these more strategic needs apply 
to a smaller number of select suppliers only.” She paused and 
then said: “We still do not have an overarching definition of 
SRM though, do we? Do we need one?”
“I think it would help,” said Rick.
Thomas intervened again: “I think we are saying that SRM 
should encompass all interactions with suppliers. This includes 
foundational elements that are applicable to all suppliers and the 
strategic elements that are applicable to select suppliers.”

Chapter 3 | To SRM and Beyond! 
20
That seemed to work for them. There was general nodding. 
Laura said, “Well, now we know what SRM is. On Thursday, we 
will agree why we need to do it!”
The Second Workshop
The group reconvened at the same time two days later to answer 
the question, Why should we pursue SRM? 
“You know,” remarked Thomas, “this is not such a simple 
question to answer actually.”
“I know,” said Laura. “The entire culture of procurement is 
focused on savings. Everybody understands that the reason to do 
strategic sourcing is to receive better value for your money. When 
they say that, they really mean cut costs and get savings.”
“As the CFO, I have to say that there is nothing wrong with 
savings, as long as they are real,” Garner pointed out.
“I like savings too,” said Laura with a smile. “But, SRM is 
a much broader topic. I am not so sure we all have the same 
objectives in mind.”
Scarlet then jumped in. “Supplier management is not really 
something that procurement does, Laura. To the extent that it 
happens, it is we in the business who do it.”
“SRM is delegated to users,” said Laura. “I agree with you.”
“I am not sure I would use the word delegated,” commented 
Scarlet. “It implies that there is some conscious choice or 
mandate that is possessed by procurement in the first place.”
“Point taken,” said Laura. “I think we can agree on the 
following: While procurement leads sourcing efforts and 
negotiates the contracts that reduce unit price, it is the users 
that actually manage the day-to-day and strategic aspects of the 
supplier relationship and many times they do not even include 
procurement in decisions. As a result, suppliers maintain and 
coordinate an extensive network of interactions and personal 
contacts with us while the company lacks transparency on the 
overall relationship. The situation is not optimal, is it?”
“That’s right,” Thomas affirmed.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
21
Some debate ensued over what exactly made sense to do. Rick felt 
that the individual functions should provide better transparency 
on day-to-day supplier compliance with supplier scorecards.
Scarlet wanted to drive value beyond compliance and experiment 
with supplier innovation conferences and executive sponsors. 
“I think we should hold a big supplier summit and even give 
awards as a way to build enthusiasm,” she said. Thomas and 
Laura exchanged glances.
“That’s a classic marketing approach, Scarlet,” Thomas said 
with a smile to show that he understood her perspective. “I’m 
sure there is a place for that, but we need to address the key 
question of why we should do this!”
“You prompt an idea though, Scarlet,” added Laura. “We do want 
excitement from our key suppliers. This needs to be bold. SRM 
is the opportunity for us to channel the energy of our supply base 
for competitive advantage.”
Scarlet interjected: “Yes. SRM should be driven by creating 
a sustainable competitive advantage through the pursuit of 
value beyond cost reduction—growth and innovation, risk 
management, capital optimization, and so on.”
“And cost, don’t forget cost,” said Garner.
“We won’t forget that, my friend,” responded Thomas. “But, the 
ultimate prize from SRM is really to team with select suppliers 
and build a competitively advantaged ecosystem, isn’t it? That’s 
what we want to do as a business, surely. Cost reduction only 
gets us so far. Right?”
There was nodding, even from Garner, who said, “Actually, we 
are about to enter our five-year strategic planning cycle again. 
SRM needs to be part of that.”
“You are right,” said Thomas. “SRM really requires a focus on 
enabling our five-year plan. SRM can contribute to this year’s 
business plan, but the primary payoff is longer term. I think we 
all agree?”
There was general nodding around the table.
“Tomorrow, we will talk about why we need to do this now,” 
concluded Laura, “instead of waiting.”

Chapter 3 | To SRM and Beyond! 
22
The Third Workshop
The third question—of why Heartland needs to institute SRM 
now—was relatively easy for the group to answer. 
Laura opened the discussion: “We have sourced our supply base 
lots of times now. We know which suppliers are best suited for 
the key areas of spending. Constant threats to switch suppliers 
are losing their credibility.”
“I agree,” said Rick. “In fact, a significant portion of the supply 
base is so entrenched in our business models that there are few 
viable alternatives anyway.”
“I think we all know that a sole focus on cost reduction is not 
sufficient to meet the dynamics of today’s global economy,” 
offered Thomas. “I’ve been thinking about this,” he said as 
he consulted some notes. He then quickly wrote the following 
summaries of key macro-economic points on the whiteboard:
—Changing growth imperatives: evolving demographics and 
consumption, increased commoditization
—An increased demand for sustainability: avoiding depletion of 
natural resources, focus on sustainable designs
—Higher levels of risk: elevated financial volatility, rising 
commodity costs
—Tighter regulation: changing role of government, more 
regulations
At this point, Thomas paused and looked down again at his 
notes. He said, “Oh yes, and let’s not forget that cost does not go 
away as an objective either.” He then wrote:
—Continued pressure on cost: new paradigms, realignment of 
global supply chain
He continued speaking. “But, let’s not forget the month of 
mayhem we just had. The issues we had were all about innovation 
and risk management. They were supplier issues. I do not want 
to have a repeat of that. I think that is why we need to do this 
now, and not wait!”
“Yes, we need to get on with it,” agreed Garner.
“Right,” said Scarlet. “We need a supplier-centric approach to 
value beyond cost reduction. We need to start it now.”
Laura ended with, “OK, next week, we tackle the remaining 
questions. I hope that is soon enough for us all.”

The Fourth Workshop
The group reconvened at 5:00 p.m. on Monday. Laura introduced 
the session: “We have defined what SRM is, why we need it, and 
why we need to implement it as fast as we can. Today we need to 
discuss this question, What does it take to build a leading SRM 
capability?”
“I think that is tricky,” said Thomas.
“Yes,” agreed Laura. “Today, in all the companies that I have 
reached out to for best practice comparisons, SRM is severely 
underdeveloped versus strategic sourcing. Specifically, in none 
of them is SRM established as a robust and repeatable process 
consistently deployed across the enterprise. They are even 
prepared to admit that, and as you know we are all quite proud 
and hate to admit failings externally!”
There was then quite a bit of discussion about how difficult it 
would be to implement SRM. A little way into the conversation, 
Rick spoke up: “I have been thinking about this. Successful SRM 
really requires the development of an integrated, comprehensive 
operating model that is focused on driving value. This ‘form 
follows function’ operating model needs to include repeatable 
management processes, enabling tools, key metrics, inclusive 
governance, new people skills, and supporting organizational 
structures that are guided by a set of commonly understood 
principles.”
“I think that is right,” said Laura. The others nodded.
Rick continued: “At a high level, this operating model includes 
a number of elements.” He then jotted the following elements on 
the whiteboard:
—Processes: 
compliance 
management, 
segmentation, 
collaboration
—Tools: scorecards, comprehensive intercompany trade-flow 
maps
—Metrics and incentives: value measurement and gain sharing
—Governance: interlocking cross-enterprise executive sponsors, 
committees
—Talent: people skilled in collaborative problem solving and 
communications
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 | To SRM and Beyond! 
24
—Organizational structure: focused departments positioned to 
work in a complex environment
There was general agreement on the points.
“I do not want to push back on our urgency to get this done and 
in place,” Rick said. “But, my sense is that there will be quite a 
lot of work involved. We do not have all the capability we need. 
We need to build it and/or acquire it.”
“You are right,” agreed Laura.
Thomas chimed in: “I could certainly see you needing to do a 
lot more to put the right capability in place within procurement 
to orchestrate this.”
Laura responded, “Yes. I guess that takes us on to our final 
question, too: What is the best way to get started? We talk about 
that on Wednesday.”
The Fifth Workshop
“How do we get started?” was Garner’s opening statement 
the next time the group met. “That is a really tough question. 
It seems to me that we are trailblazing. There are so few best 
practice examples to learn from. It is never easy.”
“I think we need to learn from other initiatives we have already 
deployed across Heartland,” Thomas offered. “Goes without 
saying really, but we also need to be pragmatic.”
“When we put in place the global marketing operating model 
across all our businesses, we had a similar challenge,” commented 
Scarlet. “We needed to change the way we were doing things, be 
more consistent but still allow for quick and decisive decision 
making on the frontline.”
“It worked well,” said Rick.
Scarlet continued. “That would mean we need to set up a joint 
task force to establish a common-core SRM capability that 
will serve as a guideline for the whole of Heartland. Individual 
businesses and functions will then be allowed to tailor this core 
SRM capability to their situation while maintaining the ability to 
speak to suppliers with a common voice.”

“Yes,” said Laura. “We then need to do this in a ‘test and learn’ 
mindset that measures and communicates value realized. As we 
proceed, we need to learn the lessons and get better.”
“I agree,” said Thomas.
“I will start to work up a plan,” said Laura. “This has been a 
very helpful series of meetings. I suggest we review it at our 
executive meeting this coming Monday.”
Getting to TrueSRM
The team left the room. Laura then approached Thomas, who 
asked her, “Did that achieve your objectives?” 
“I think so,” she said. “But there is one issue. Even after all this, 
I think that there is still a missing ingredient.”
“I think so too,” said Thomas. “It’s great that we have alignment 
on all these questions, but I’m not sure we are really there yet 
either. Our whole problem with this started because we have not 
been managing suppliers properly. For that, one size really does 
not fit all. I have seen traditional segmentation approaches and, 
for me, these really never work. They are never applied properly 
either. What do you think?”
Laura responded, “I think we need to take a much more effective 
approach. We need to have a genuinely differentiated strategy 
for managing our interactions holistically with suppliers. That is 
what I really see as living and breathing TrueSRM. I have some 
ideas . . . .”
Key to a Profitable Future
Right now, Heartland is at the stage where it realizes it needs to manage 
supplier interactions more effectively and more comprehensively across 
its business. It also needs to do this sooner rather than later; there is a 
genuine imperative. At the very least, the CEO does not want to endure 
another month of mayhem.
Although the Heartland case is fictional, it mirrors real-life experiences 
that we have had with SRM. We have worked extensively with clients 
who have implemented strategic sourcing across their businesses, and 
who are adept at negotiating to achieve “savings.” However, these clients 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 | To SRM and Beyond! 
26
were missing the “secret sauce” of how to manage supplier relationships 
effectively to achieve wider objectives associated with innovation, sustain-
ability, and risk management. We developed and implemented TrueSRM 
with clients precisely to address these needs that are highlighted in the 
Heartland experience.
In the next chapter, we will address the question that Laura and Thomas 
have left us with—how to effectively put TrueSRM in place. We will 
describe the key that is needed to unlock “the genuinely differentiated 
approach to managing our interactions holistically with suppliers,” which 
is the idea Thomas is searching for. This is where interaction models enter 
our story.

The Framework for SRM Success
One of the core ambitions we had when we developed the TrueSRM 
program was to develop a practical framework that actually worked. Too 
many prior SRM initiatives got stuck at a philosophical level that let 
companies believe things like the idea that they should partner with all 
suppliers. Chapter 2 discussed other SRM initiatives that have focused 
fully on processes and IT systems that manage who is talking to which 
supplier about what. While this aspect of the system might be useful, it 
falls short of the true potential in SRM.
The workable framework we aspired to develop aims at a lot more than 
merely suggesting partnerships or managing processes. As we suggested, 
in our view, SRM is ultimately about motivating suppliers to behave in 
ways that will meet a company’s needs.

With this objective in mind, two requirements for the framework emerged:
It needs to separate those suppliers that really matter 
• 
from the overwhelming number of suppliers a company 
usually has.
It needs to provide specific recommendations on how 
• 
to interact with suppliers that fall into its different 
areas.
In order to separate the suppliers that really matter from the others, we 
looked into dimensions that allow us to gauge what a supplier means to 
a company. This process was fairly straightforward. We essentially said 
that it is important to take into consideration the supplier’s current per-
formance and the supplier’s strategic potential. With this, we had the two 
axes of the SRM framework.
Bringing the framework to life was more challenging. The first ques-
tion to clarify was whether we would propose distinct models or an 
unlimited number of shades of grey. Our 2008 book, The Purchasing 
Chessboard, suggested shades of grey. In this model, a category gets 
mapped onto the chessboard and then the 64 methods that are in the 
general area of the category get evaluated for their relevance to the 
specific category. Since the chessboard (Figure 4-1) is mainly used by 
specialists dealing with that specific category, this ambiguity made a lot 
of sense. For further information on the Purchasing Chessboard, see 
http://www.purchasingchessboard.com.

With SRM, we are dealing with a very different environment. The SRM 
framework will be applied by senior executives from different functional 
areas. It therefore needs distinct models that are easy to use. After several 
iterations, we settled on a three-by-three logic with nine distinct supplier 
interaction models. While it is not trivial to remember nine different 
models and their position relative to each other, we found it just at the 
limit of being doable. After a couple of days of practice, senior executives 
in the pilot companies we worked with got comfortable with the nine 
interaction models and started using them in a natural way.
This chapter provides a high-level introduction to the two axes of the 
framework and the nine interaction models (see Figure 4-2).

Performance Axis
There are a number of supplier-performance variables that potentially 
matter to a customer. At the highest aggregation level, these include 
time (e.g., on-time, in-full deliveries); cost (e.g., savings vs. the previous 
period); and quality (e.g., number of implemented improvement ideas in 
the period).
On a closer look, most systems used to measure the performance of sup-
pliers are not really ideal. Often, the systems are very complex, measur-
ing hundreds of performance indicators, and nobody can explain exactly 
why their specific indicators and not others are in place. Also, we have 
observed output factors, like savings performance, and input factors, like 
the excellence of engineering processes being merged together. Further, 
weighing factors doesn’t increase the effectiveness of these performance 
measurement systems.
Then there is the human factor. Different evaluators tend to interpret 
performance indicators differently and also look at suppliers differently. 
We have seen wildly fluctuating supplier performance that turned out to 
be driven not by the supplier’s actual performance but by the variance in 
people conducting the performance appraisal.
While existing supplier performance measurement systems need to be 
taken with a grain of salt, they at least provide a starting point for populat-
ing the performance axis of the SRM framework. In an ideal world, an SRM 
initiative might start with overhauling supplier performance management.

Each of the functions having interfaces with a supplier would come up with 
a very limited set of performance indicators. These would then be consoli-
dated into a lean and effective performance indicator structure that would 
be shared with suppliers.
It is tempting to go down this avenue, but we would not recommend it. 
Many SRM initiatives have gone wrong doing exactly that. Supplier per-
formance indicators can become very emotional topics that can easily 
be debated hotly over many months. So, our recommendation is to work 
with whatever you have today and leave fixing supplier performance 
measurement for a later point in time.
The real challenge is to make the existing performance measurement 
meaningful. This can be done most effectively by borrowing from an HR 
department. Employee performance management processes are typically 
burdened by an inflation of too many excellent ratings. The way of HR 
people to deal with this is to ask for forced rankings of employees. 
In essence, the managers of two excellent employees will be asked to 
agree on which of the two employees is even more excellent than the 
other. We propose deploying the same principle for populating the per-
formance axis of the TrueSRM framework.
Here’s how it might work: Initially, you would tap into the available supplier  
performance reports. You would then aggregate these reports across 
business units on a supplier level. If all business units are similar in size, 
no weighing is necessary. If there is a substantial difference in size and 
if business units do have significantly different requirements, appropriate 
weighing approaches should be introduced. This weighing could simply 
be based on the relative revenue of different businesses. But one might 
feel that this would lead suppliers to neglect the smaller businesses. This 
would be especially counterproductive if the smaller businesses are high 
growth and consequently need high-performing suppliers to support that 
growth. In that case, one could base the weighing on a pure arithmetic 
average of the scores in different businesses. Or, one may still base the  
initial weighing on relative revenue but then make adjustments for different  
growth prospects.
You would then calibrate the aggregated performance reports to 
achieve a normal distribution, or bell curve, over the performance axis. 
With this normal distribution, 5 percent of suppliers would fall into the 
high-performance category, another 5 percent would fall into low per-
formance, and the remaining 90 percent of suppliers would fall into the 
medium performance category.
If you are reading closely, you see where this is going. In TrueSRM, we 
want to focus the company’s top management attention and resources on 
those suppliers that really matter. And the suppliers that matter are the 
top performers and the underperformers.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models
32
Top performers matter because they are the suppliers that have the most 
chance of helping the company shape its future. Not all top performers 
will be able to help shape the company’s future, and it is particularly hard 
to see that a supplier whose performance is not excellent will be able 
to do so.
Underperformers also matter because they drag the entire company down. 
They tie up valuable resources used fixing the delivery, cost, and quality 
issues they cause. Something needs to be done about underperformers.
The vast majority of suppliers in the middle may matter from a different 
perspective. But as long as we have untapped potential with high-performing 
suppliers, and unresolved issues with low-performing suppliers, they will 
not be the focus of attention. This is why it is usually counterproductive 
to start by overhauling and refining to the nth degree the approach to 
supplier performance measurement. The approach needs to be robust 
enough to enable the high performers and low performers to be triaged. 
It does not need to enable the 63rd percentile to be distinguished from 
the 62nd percentile, particularly given that suppliers provide different 
goods and services in any case.
Strategic Potential Axis
We have seen that populating the performance axis is tricky even when 
we do have data we can build on. Populating the strategic potential 
axis is far more difficult. Most companies do not have any established 
mechanisms to gauge the strategic potential of a supplier. Even worse, 
many companies are using the term “partner” in an inflationary way. 
Any high-performing supplier, or just a big one, will often be labeled as 
partner or even strategic partner.
While we cautioned about rebuilding the supplier performance evaluation 
system of a company when embarking on the SRM journey, we encour-
age doing just that for the strategic potential axis. There cannot be any 
TrueSRM as long as the key decision makers of the company are not 
aligned on what makes a supplier strategically important.
When we say strategic potential, we mean the relevance the supplier can 
have in relation to the execution of the company’s strategy. A supplier with 
high strategic potential should hold the key to a competitive advantage for 
the company. This competitive advantage might not yet be realized today 
because either the company has not yet understood how to tap into the 
supplier’s potential or because the supplier’s current performance blurs 
the view on the strategic potential.

The high-level strategic potential of a supplier can be measured across  
a number of indicators:
• 
Growth: Does the supplier offer capabilities that could 
improve the company’s value proposition for existing  
customers or generate sales with new customers? 
Examples would be wide geographic reach of the sup-
plier or an excellent understanding of customer needs.
• 
Innovation: Does the supplier own or propose new 
technologies that could lead to breakthrough for the 
company’s products and services? Examples would 
be a supplier that has developed critical patents or 
conducted strategic mergers and acquisitions.
• 
Scope: Is the supplier relevant for the company across 
most business units? An example of such a supplier 
would be a true portfolio player that supports the 
company by supplying all of its divisions.
• 
Collaboration: Does the supplier demonstrate the right 
mindset in working with the company across different 
functional areas? An example would be a supplier that 
leverages its critical capabilities in an effective way.
For the introduction of the strategic potential axis, we suggest a fairly pro-
vocative approach. In contrast to the often inflationary use of the terms 
strategic and partner, in our view, the default strategic potential of a sup-
plier should be low. We strongly believe that at least 90 percent of suppli-
ers have very limited strategic potential to a company.
While populating the performance axis of the SRM framework is done in 
a bottom-up way, for the strategic potential axis we suggest doing it with a 
top-down approach. Top management should get together and determine 
the suppliers that have high or medium strategic potential. Overall, we 
would expect to find 2 percent of suppliers at most to have high strategic 
potential and 8 percent of suppliers to have medium strategic potential. In 
most cases, the high-potential strategic suppliers should amount to only 
a couple of handfuls.
The Framework
Looking at the overall picture in Figure 4-3, a pattern begins to emerge. 
Most suppliers will be center left in the portfolio, which means that they 
have average performance and are in mature business relationships. 
A limited number of suppliers will reside in the “interesting areas” at the 
corners of the portfolio. This leads to the question of how to interact 
with these suppliers.

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models

Regardless of industry, company size, or a dozen other factors, suppliers 
tend to fall into three distinct camps: There are those in the “critical clus-
ter” that can contribute to competitive advantage, with some nurturing of 
the relationship. There are the “ordinaries” that can provide needed but 
common products or services that could be purchased from many other 
sources. And then there are those “problematic” ones that have been 
useful sources of supply but pose serious problems that need to be fixed 
or the supplier replaced.
Managing supplier relationships is nothing new, of course. What is new 
is our system for recognizing what characterizes a supplier in relation to 
a company’s unique business objectives. What is the core nature of the 
relationship? How can it better serve the company’s success? What do 
the suppliers themselves want? And how do we communicate with them, 
both in terms of where they stand now and where we want them to be in 
the future? This last point is especially pertinent because supplier relation-
ships are rarely structured in a way that guides internal conversations and 
planning, or allows for communication in actionable terms.
Identifying individual formulas or models that together characterize 
TrueSRM is the premise that drove the project team to develop nine ways 
to interact with suppliers. Each model gets to the heart of what makes the 
most common and effective supplier relationships tick while establishing  
expectations for what each relationship is capable of and laying the

groundwork for mutual success. While there is no substitute for classic 
sourcing or the proficiency of our Purchasing Chessboard, our supplier 
relationship management approach is designed to identify and support 
those relationships that pose the greatest return on investment while 
considering the limited time constraints of many CPOs.
The Nine Relationships
Figure 4-4 introduces the nine supplier relationship models in detail:

Maximize the value received
from supplier without
committing client.
Influence
Integrate
Enter a multiyear exclusive
relationship with the objective
to shape the market.
Improve
Provided there is a positive
business case, assist supplier
in fixing shortcomings.
Mitigate
Deploy up-or-out mindset
without hesitation.
Sustain

Develop
Commit limited resources to
get supplier ready for
business with client.
Bail out
Dedicate rapid intervention
force to secure supply.
Define joint objective to build 
competencies and commit

Tap into supplier technology 
to jointly develop and launch 
products and services.
Monitor supplier performance 
and optimize value through 
roadmap synchronization.
Figure 4-4.  Nine interaction models
Critical Cluster: The Relationships to Nurture
The first category under our microscope, the critical cluster, includes the 
three types of suppliers that offer the most promise. Whether they are the 
vendors that already have a great relationship with you, or the ones that 
clearly could have one with a little work, these relationships are the valuable 
few that are worth time and attention.
Integrate: Worthy of Commitment
In this box, we find the Integrate model, where the two organizations have 
goals that are genuinely integrated and they work together as partners. 
To put it colloquially, this is a partnership with a capital “P”. Although 
an often-overused term in business, this type of true partnership is rare 
and is based on a multiyear, differentiated, and comprehensive relationship 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models

between you and your supplier to build an ecosystem that shapes the 
market. The supplier chosen for this model should be in your sweet spot: 
its performance needs to be flawless, and it needs to hold the key to 
making you a formidable competitor by creating opportunities to grow 
revenues and profits while jointly shaping or reshaping the industry.
Influence: Joint Development of New Offerings
Suppliers that fit the Influence model in this box deliver nearly perfect 
products or services. What sets them apart is that they offer the poten-
tial for innovation by working with you to jointly develop new products or 
services. This factor shapes your relationship with them. These suppliers 
often dominate an industry, as they are the crucial few that a company and 
its competitors rely on. In turn, they do not favor any one customer, and 
in the case of monopolistic suppliers, are required by law not to do so. 
The downside, of course, is that it is nearly impossible to outpace your 
competition by working with these suppliers. What’s more, mismanage 
this relationship and you could alienate these suppliers enough that you 
fall behind competitors that may be better at handling their relationship 
with the same supplier.
Invest: Promise of Capability
Does your company have suppliers that offer great ideas and innovations 
but then stumble in some basic areas, such as providing continuous supply 
or consistent quality? Those suppliers fall into the Invest model. A great 
future can be had with these suppliers—as they ultimately could reach 
Integrate status—but their potential for this rests on the relationship you 
build with them now and the extent to which they respond. Ideally, an 
Invest supplier will aspire to Integrate status and will invest with you in 
building capabilities to achieve this title. Here, we recommend nurturing 
the relationship by investing time, money, and resources in developing the 
supplier’s capabilities to meet your needs. The best candidates will make 
capability building a top priority. Be forewarned, however, that some sup-
pliers may spurn the help, believing that you are attempting to make them 
“captive” and cut them off from wider market opportunities.
Ordinaries: The Widget Providers
While the three supplier types that fall into the ordinary camp are gen-
erally more numerous, don’t let their average status fool you. There is 
strength in numbers here. With more of these dime-a-dozen suppliers in 
your fold, having a keen understanding of what makes these relationships 
tick, and a simple set of tools for maintaining or incrementally improving 
their performance, can have sizeable positive results for you.

Harvest: Highly Productive But Still Needs Cultivating
The Harvest model represents a well-functioning position for both parties. 
The company receives exactly the type of products or services it needs 
from the supplier. These things are nearly perfect, in fact, and support the 
company’s competitiveness. For you and the supplier, this relationship is 
virtually hassle-free and ties up few resources. It may seem to function on 
its own, and that’s exactly where both parties need to focus. Complacency 
should be the red flag here. Great performance could be mistaken for a 
great partnership. We recommend not using the term “partner” loosely, 
because it can lead to assumptions that nothing needs to be changed. Low 
investment of resources can communicate that you don’t overtly value 
this relationship and that if the supplier falters, it could be dropped. The 
Harvest supplier’s vulnerability, then, and the absence of discussion about 
maintaining performance, can create tension that negatively influences 
interactions between the parties.
Sustain: Worthy of Continuous Improvement
You probably work with a number of Sustain suppliers. Their performance 
is average, but aspects of this type of relationship place it above the ones 
you have with most suppliers, usually because you need these relationships 
to endure. They do not need major fixes or warrant significant investment. 
However, undertaking incremental improvement to capture more value 
and move performance toward world-class levels can usually benefit you.
Improve: Shortcomings Need to Be Addressed
The majority of your suppliers are likely to fit in the Improve category. 
They perform at a level similar to that of a Sustain supplier, but with 
shortcomings. The key difference is that should they fail—especially 
repeatedly—you would be more likely to replace them than you would a 
faltering Sustain supplier. The Improve relationship can feel unstable for 
both you and the supplier as a result. Instead, to profit from the relation-
ship you will learn to turn the unknowns into opportunities by helping the 
Improve supplier to raise performance and move toward Harvest status.
Problematic Suppliers: The Serious Fixes
Rather than rue the day you hired certain suppliers that have become 
problematic, take a close look at what has gone wrong and learn from 
everyone’s mistakes. Indeed, this is the time to contain the damage. 
It’s also a great opportunity to repair relationships that warrant the 
investment, or at least keep the lines of communication open should 
you both go your separate ways but later find that things look better.

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models
38
Mitigate: Need to Be Disengaged on Good Terms
Sometimes, it just doesn’t work out. The Mitigate supplier has significant 
ongoing issues with delivery, cost, or quality, for example, and it’s time 
to replace this source with one that is more promising. The risks and 
consequences of doing this then need to be mitigated. Relationships that 
reach the Mitigate stage are easy to transition out of when the failing 
supplier is small or the business is simply structured. But when there are 
multiple lines of business, numerous product segments, or big outsourcing 
agreements with a long-term supplier, replacement becomes a challenge. 
Paradoxically, the quality of this relationship—even though it is ending—is 
one of the most important supplier interactions to maintain at a level of 
openness and clarity while you are still working together.
Develop: Candidates for the Ideal Source
To establish a competitive advantage and operational benefits where none 
currently exist, consider building a Develop relationship with a supplier 
whose current performance is poor and needs to be addressed. This 
should be a hand-selected vendor with lots of potential for working closely 
with you to identify opportunities across its value chain and yours. Reach 
out to your in-house cross-functional teams to identify viable candidates 
that are currently not ready for prime time but have the basic potential  
to become star suppliers. There are numerous examples of Develop  
suppliers that become key sources in well-managed relationships that last 
for years. Consider, for example, the many manufacturers that nurture 
low-cost country suppliers, providing technology or engineering assistance 
to get them up to speed as component suppliers.
Bail Out: Stepping In Is Necessary
A major supplier commits an egregious error or a chronic problem 
suddenly requires triage. This is the abrupt formation of the Bail Out 
relationship. The situation can significantly jeopardize business by threat-
ening supply.
The immediate goal is to stabilize the performance of the supplier, whose 
reaction will be hard to predict. Long term, look to learn from the prob-
lem to avoid future bail outs with this supplier. It may seem counterin-
tuitive, but this is a relationship that will likely be maintained, particularly 
with important suppliers. The Bail Out relationship itself should be brief, 
rarely occur, and be regarded as a temporary step toward improving the 
overall supplier relationship.

Heartland Develops TrueSRM
Meanwhile, back at Heartland Industries, Thomas and Laura 
were grappling with their recognition that they needed an 
approach for TrueSRM.
After her conversation with Thomas following the final workshop, 
Laura went back to her office and pondered the situation. She 
realized that, as CEO, Thomas did not want to be concerned 
with all the details of every supplier. Of course. That was a 
given. As CPO, she herself could not be concerned with every 
supplier. Heartland had several thousand suppliers globally, and 
this was unlikely to change radically. She also pondered what 
Thomas had meant by “managing our interactions holistically 
with suppliers.” The word holistically caused her to pause. She 
felt that it made sense. Heartland needed to set up SRM in a 
way that enabled it to orchestrate all dimensions of a supplier 
relationship—performance, cost, behaviors, risk, and so forth. 
But this had to be tailored to the specifics of the relationship. 
Otherwise, this would be far too unwieldy and resource intensive 
for the business to execute. There needed to be some form of 
differentiation that the business could implement.
Laura had seen segmentation approaches before, but she had not 
seen one that really provided a basis for managing interactions 
in the differentiated way that she sought. One approach that she 
had seen talked about had you identify “strategic,” “core,” and 
“noncore” suppliers. This had always led to lots of debate about 
what exactly a strategic supplier was. Previously, she had seen 
the word strategic used as a proxy for “large,” which missed the 
point. Marshfield, which had just tied up with Calbury Industries, 
was not a particularly large organization.
Laura sensed that many of the most valuable suppliers, who 
could bring exclusive innovation, were indeed likely to be 
small, entrepreneurial, and lacking “pedigree.” She thought of 
digital marketing, for example, as an area that classic advertising 
agencies were still grappling with. Heartland might prefer not to 
deal with the established players at all in this space and instead 
bypass them. “Young start-ups might just be able to bring what 
the business needs as our suppliers,” she mused. “They might 
not be operationally so robust, though.” Clearly, there is a big 
distinction to draw between current performance and strategic 
potential.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models
40
“Conversely, some suppliers perform well but lack strategic 
potential,” she thought. “Best not to spend too much time on 
them.” She wondered about what to call them. “Well, they 
certainly are not particularly special suppliers. They are 
actually quite ordinary, really. Maybe then we should call these 
‘Ordinaries.’ Most of our suppliers belong in this camp.” Others, 
she knew, perform well and have great strategic potential. 
Marshfield might have belonged in this camp. These are suppliers 
that need strong attention—including personal attention from 
Thomas. They are far more special. “Probably better not to call 
them special, though. They are critical to the business.” She now 
had a name for them. “That’s it—these are the ‘Critical Cluster.’ 
Then, there are other suppliers who basically give us problems. 
That’s an easy name. They are the ‘Problematic Suppliers,’ who 
have either performance issues, limited strategic potential, or 
both. Big danger if we spend too much time on these suppliers. 
Although the ones with poor performance but strong strategic 
potential might be worthy of being nurtured. We would need to 
make our bets carefully.”
Laura really felt she had made progress in how to work through 
to TrueSRM. It was close to the end of the day now. She got 
her Stylus out and started to draw on her iPad. She labeled the 
vertical axis “Performance” and the horizontal axis “Strategic 
Potential.” [Figure  4-5.] She then drew the three clusters. 
She placed the Critical Cluster on the top right, Problematic 
Suppliers horizontally across the bottom, and Ordinaries to fill 
the rest of the screen. She decided to go back to see Thomas. 
“Time for action,” she muttered under her breath as she left  
her office.

Thomas’s office door was wide open and Laura walked in. She 
showed him what she had done on her iPad and emphasized how 
it would help them to prioritize executive effort.
“So we focus on how well they perform now versus their 
potential value. Makes sense,” he mused. “I just wonder whether 
three clusters is really granular enough to be actionable.”
“You may be right,” said Laura. “Shall we sketch it on the 
whiteboard and think about it?”
Thomas nodded. Laura drew the two axes. She added the three 
clusters. They focused first on the top right-hand corner.
“At the very top right will be the closest relationships,” said 
Thomas. “That’s obvious.”
“The true partnerships,” added Laura.
“Yes,” Thomas agreed. “But, I am not sure we should use the  
P word. It’s so overused that I think it is often meaningless. 
These are really situations where we want to achieve some close 
form of integration between our business and theirs. Maybe we 
call these Integrate.”

“Right,” Laura replied. “The bottom-left corner is easy too. That 
is where we want to get out of an unsatisfactory relationship 
without breaking too much china. So, let’s just call it Mitigate. 
The extremities are probably the easiest ones. What about 
the top left?”
“That’s interesting,” said Thomas. “A high-performing supplier 
where we do not really value the strategic potential. It’s the sort 
of supplier we sometimes see in noncore categories. They can be 
really good at what they do, but we’d only notice if they suddenly 
stopped. This is the type of relationship where we just sit back 
and harvest the good work they do. Let’s call these Harvest.”
“Great,” remarked Laura. “Bottom right are the suppliers we 
value a lot, but their current performance is a big issue and can 
stop us shipping product. These are the situations where we need 
to step in ourselves to fix things or to bail the supplier out. So, 
let’s call these Bail Out.”
“I agree,” Thomas replied. “What about the middle of the board? 
That feels like the next logical place to go. In the very middle, 
we have relationships that we value. But, they have only average 
or so-so performance. We probably need to maintain or sustain 
these relationships, but they are not overly exciting for us.”
“So, we can call them Sustain,” suggested Laura.
Five interaction models had now been created.
“Now, for the more challenging ones between the extremes,” 
proceeded Thomas. “Let’s start top middle. These are strong 
suppliers that we need to be successful, but that we will probably 
never be in a position to integrate with.”
Laura interjected. “In these cases, our aim should probably be to 
influence them to provide innovation on a limited scale.”
“So maybe we should call these Influence,” proposed Thomas. 
“What about the right middle?”
“There we have middling performance but high strategic 
potential. So, perhaps these are suppliers where we may need to 
establish some form of joint action or investment with to create 
something special between us. It could be a new capability that 
is greater than either of us already has, or a new facility for 
example. Perhaps we call that Invest,” suggested Laura.
“That works,” said Thomas. “Good, seven models defined. What 
about the bottom middle?”
www.it-ebooks.info

“Poor performance, reasonable relationship value. Sounds like 
these are suppliers we want to keep but something needs to 
happen so they can meet our performance needs. We probably 
need to devote some effort to help that happen, but without 
overdoing things.”
“So we can call these Develop then. One more left. Middle left.”
“Low relationship value and middling performance,” was 
Laura’s assessment. “No obvious reason why we would invest 
much in such a relationship. These are suppliers where we need 
them to step up more if they are to continue with us. They need 
to do better.”
“We can call them Improve,” Thomas suggested. “Great, we 
have a 3 x 3 matrix. Consultants usually do 2 x 2. We have gone 
one better,” he joked. “Where do you think most suppliers sit in 
this framework, Laura?”
“Oh, I think mainly toward the left. There will be very few in 
the top right. But, the top right is where we ought to focus our 
attention.”
“Do you think we should do that properly? I mean, do we devote 
most of our attention to the few suppliers in the top right? Or do 
we dissipate it elsewhere?”
“Gosh. I am not sure. Maybe not.”
“You might want to get some analysis done. I would be interested 
in the result.”
“I will do that,” agreed Laura. “I will also get to work on how 
we can use this.”
Categorizing Suppliers
In this chapter, we have introduced the TrueSRM framework. This frame-
work is based on differentiated interaction models that are constructed 
by considering the performance of a supplier and its strategic potential. 
We have explained that for most companies the existing supplier-per-
formance-management approach is fit for the purpose of enabling the 
top performers and the poor performers to be differentiated from the 
majority in the middle. Conversely, most businesses do not have a robust 
approach in place to determine strategic potential with sufficient rigor. 
We strongly recommend a top-down approach to this that typically leads 
to only a very small number of suppliers (often just a couple of handfuls) 
being classified as high potential.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 | Introducing Supplier Interaction Models
44
In the next part of the chapter, we introduced the nine different interac-
tion models that this framework gives rise to. These are discussed as 
being within three separate clusters. Deploying these models effectively 
for different suppliers is critical for really bringing TrueSRM to life.
The next three chapters are structured by cluster. For each interaction 
type, we will explain the key characteristics of suppliers, the types of 
behaviors that need to be undertaken, and the best ways to work with 
the suppliers. We will also outline the preferred governance approach and 
provide a case study example. As we do this, we also continue the story 
of Heartland as they put their TrueSRM program into effect by deploying 
the different models.

The 
“Ordinaries” 
Driving Behavior to Get Results
Our tour of the different clusters begins with the “Ordinaries.” We start 
here because this is the area where by far the vast majority of suppliers 
will be located.
It is also an area that is in danger of being overlooked. Doing so would be 
a mistake. While you need to beware of overinvesting time and attention 
on this cluster, don’t let the average status of these suppliers fool you. 
There is strength in numbers here. A keen understanding of what makes 
these relationships tick, and a simple set of tools for maintaining or incre-
mentally improving their performance, can have sizeable positive results.
Characteristics of Improve Suppliers
The majority of your suppliers are likely to fit here.
Sustain suppliers are interesting and promising from the perspective of 
relationship potential. Harvest suppliers are not so interesting from the 
perspective of relationship potential but perform well at what they do. 
Improve suppliers (Figure 5-1) are interesting in terms of neither. They have 
very limited promise and there are shortcomings in their performance.

C H A P T E R 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
46
Improve suppliers are typically the suppliers that many organizations have 
in the more basic purchasing areas. They supply commodity-style products 
and services that are not core to the customer’s competitive advantage. 
Their share of your wallet is likely to be relatively low but may not be 
in all cases. Your importance to them is likely to vary. Improve suppliers 
typically range from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who are 
highly dependent on a small number of customers, through to large cor-
porations that serve many thousands of different clients.
The common theme is that their performance is broadly acceptable but 
not stunning. And, as with Sustain suppliers, there may be a history of 
missing deadlines or occasional quality issues that have left a sour taste 
in the mouth. The issues have not been so dramatic as to warrant the 
need to replace the supplier, but nor can the supplier be described as an 
“unsung hero” in the way that Harvest suppliers can be.
For these reasons, an Improve supplier will not make it into the innermost 
circle of suppliers from the perspective of the company. Should an Improve 
supplier fail—especially repeatedly—then you would be very likely to 
replace it. The Improve relationship can feel quite unstable as a result.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
Usually, the preferred behavior is for an Improve supplier to address its 
shortcomings and move toward becoming a Harvest supplier. This is 
usually preferable to incurring the costs and dislocation of replacement.

The exception to this is if the investment and resource commitment asso-
ciated with the behavior change is disproportionate to the benefit the 
customer will receive. In that situation, replacement might become the 
right option. However, it still needs to be thought about carefully given 
that identifying alternative superstar suppliers is often challenging and not 
guaranteed to be successful, and will incur search costs. Companies often 
spend time fruitlessly looking for the holy grail of the ideal supplier. For 
Improve suppliers, this is rarely the right option.
Note
■
■
  It is usually preferable to help an Improve supplier become a Harvest supplier. It 
is less expensive than “firing” the supplier and finding a new one, whose performance isn’t 
guaranteed to be an improvement.
How to Work with Improve Suppliers
Similarly to Sustain suppliers, the challenge with Improve suppliers is to 
strike the right balance between investment and return from the relation-
ship. The calculation is one that is more finely poised because you value 
the relationship potential less and are more likely to replace the supplier. 
You need to be very clear and straightforward in how you deal with the 
Improve supplier. Clearly communicate how it needs to perform more 
effectively. Be candid about its future potential. Otherwise, these suppliers 
will lack a true understanding of the situation and fail to improve, leading 
to the more laborious task for you of replacing them.
Governance 
The effort dedicated to managing the relationship needs to be kept within 
clear bounds while still facilitating the sending of very clear signals. Regular 
review meetings with a candid exchange of dialogue will be sufficient 
governance to enable this. Typically, we would not expect these to be 
needed more than biannually.
Case Example
Consider the situation of a supplier of simple low-value parts such as 
fastenings. This product is not the source of a unique advantage for the 
customer, but the parts need to be available or else production will be 
interrupted. However, the supplier has a track record of missing delivery 
deadlines from several hours up to a day. This is not catastrophic because 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
48
the manufacturer knows about this behavior and mitigates its own risk 
by maintaining an inventory of fastenings on hand to give it an adequate 
safety margin. Additionally, the value of fastenings is low. So, the working-
capital implications of a few extra days inventory do not cause major 
alarm for the finance function. Nevertheless, this behavior is frustrating. It 
causes extra resources to be deployed to manage inventory, costs money 
in terms of inventory holding, and leads to queries being raised via enter-
prise-resource planning software and the operational buyers in the plant 
each time a deadline is missed.
Despite this major shortcoming, the correct approach is unlikely to be to 
replace the supplier concerned without making some attempt to correct 
course. If the supplier does supply fastenings that meet the quality needs 
to specification, there is no guarantee from a tender process that any new 
supplier would do this equally as well and no certainty that the delivery 
issues would be solved. Indeed, more risks may be introduced and there 
would be a significant cost of replacement. Additionally, it is even possible 
that there is an element of “six of one and half a dozen of the other” with 
respect to the problems. There may be misunderstanding over agreed 
lead times and delivery windows that is contributing to the problems.
The approach that is likely to be most fruitful here is to communicate 
very clearly to an executive at the supplier’s organization that current 
performance on delivery is unacceptable. At the same time, the messages 
need to allow for the possibility that you, the customer, may need to help 
the supplier do this—by, for example, adjusting its behavior and poten-
tially agreeing on different delivery windows or clarifying precisely what 
its requirements are. The level of help the customer would be prepared 
to give would probably not have to go too far beyond these measures in 
order to be cost-effective. There also needs to be a clear message that 
if performance does not improve then the supplier is at serious risk of 
being replaced.
Heartland Tackles Procurement
Thomas was about to wrap up the day’s work when Laura peeked 
into his office. “Do you have a couple of minutes?” she asked.
Laura had learned that the easiest way to get Thomas’s attention 
was to walk into his office early in the morning or late in the 
afternoon. Given that she had been his closest associate in his 
path to the top at Heartland, Laura still felt that this was the right 
thing to do rather than formally asking for an appointment.

“Sure, Laura, but I will need to leave in 15 minutes. Both 
Johanna and David are performing in a play at school tonight. 
Pretty exciting.”
Laura put a graph in front of Thomas. “Take a look at this. I had 
my staff perform a quick analysis of where we have allocated 
our procurement resources. As I expected, most of our people 
are dealing with suppliers on the left-hand side of our SRM 
framework. With some regional variation, we actually have 
more than 70 percent of our people dealing with suppliers in 
Improve. I had expected the overall pattern, but I was surprised 
by how extreme this picture is. We need to do something.”
With his eyes still fixated on the graph, Thomas nodded in 
agreement. “What do you suggest?”
“Do you remember those initiatives that companies used to run 
to free people from administrative work and focus them more 
on strategic topics? I think we need to do something along these 
lines. Why should we employ hundreds of people dealing with 
suppliers that don’t make any difference while we hardly have 
anyone working with the ones that really matter?”
Now, Thomas looked up. “I know that tone in your voice,” he 
said with a smile. “What are you up to?”
“I want to take this opportunity to completely reshuffle and 
upgrade our procurement function,” Laura replied. “We will free 
up a lot of our staff by scaling back the interaction with Improve 
and other Ordinary suppliers. But just repurposing these people 
will not do it because most of them lack the required skill set. My 
proposal is the following: Over the next 12 months, we take out 
40 percent of the headcount. With the available budget, I want to 
hire high-caliber people from consultancies, investment banks, 
and industry. Also, I want to start recruiting talent at the top 
MBA schools. According to my scenario, we will end up with 
an overall much reduced headcount in procurement. Of course, 
the new people I intend to bring in will be substantially more 
expensive than our current average, but we will still be below 
the current budget. They will have the more rounded skill sets 
that are needed to manage relationships internally and externally 
and get full value from the more strategic suppliers.”
Thomas responded dubiously. “Do you really want to do this 
at this point in time? You have only been in your CPO role six 
months.”

“Thomas, you and I know that there never is a good ‘point in 
time’ to do this. And you have been pretty determined to get 
things changed in various places. Why make an exception for 
procurement? I don’t expect you to make this type of decision 
right away, but I wanted to let you know where my head is. Can 
we put this on the agenda for our next Senior Leadership Team 
(SLT) meeting?”
It took a lot more than just one meeting of Heartland’s senior 
leadership team for Laura to get the ball rolling. The executives 
were immediately convinced by the logic of her pitch to 
restructure the function so as focus far more energy on managing 
Integrate and other Critical Cluster suppliers, but they remained 
concerned about the unforeseen consequences of such a deep 
cut in procurement. Laura was assigned a task force of corporate 
development and HR people to conduct a detailed analysis of 
roles, responsibilities, and skill sets. Internal stakeholders were 
interviewed about procurement’s expectations concerning 
Critical Cluster suppliers. After three months of intensive work, 
Laura reported back to the SLT with findings that just about 
confirmed her initial hypothesis.
Seeing the broad intent behind Laura’s plans, Thomas finally 
gave his approval to put the plan in action. Considering the 
magnitude of the task at hand, Thomas asked John McGrath, 
his trusted advisor, to coach Laura through the challenges of 
reshuffling an organization of more than 1,500 people scattered 
across the globe. Nine months into the program, Laura proudly 
reported the following status to the SLT:
A reduction of activities devoted to managing 
• 
Improve suppliers had been completed—the 
number of incidents or complaints: zero.
The headcount had been freed up to manage 
• 
Integrate and other Critical Cluster suppliers more 
effectively: out of 571 employees, 221 had been 
transferred to roles in other functions outside 
of procurement, 209 had accepted a voluntary 
separation package, and 141 had been transferred 
to other roles within procurement.
Thirty-seven senior hires were in place to fill new 
• 
strategic roles for Influence, Integrate, and Invest 
suppliers.
There had been 28 recruits from top-ranking 
• 
business schools.

Characteristics of Sustain Suppliers
Together with Improve, Harvest, and to a certain extent Mitigate, Sustain 
forms the more densely populated area of the SRM framework. For 
a company with 1,000 suppliers, we would expect to find dozens of 
Sustain suppliers.
Generally speaking, suppliers in Sustain (Figure 5-2) are interesting and 
promising. Their strategic potential is higher than that of the vast majority 
of suppliers working with the company. The products and services these 
suppliers provide are essential for the company’s position in the market 
and there might even be the potential to do more with them. This places 
them above the majority of the company’s suppliers. It also distinguishes 
them from Improve suppliers—it is much more challenging to replace 
them. That means that you need to invest more in the relationship but 
without overdoing things.

Figure 5-2.  Sustain suppliers on the strategy/performance axes
Despite this above-average strategic potential though, this supplier still 
has not made it into the innermost circle of suppliers from the perspec-
tive of the company. Unlike with Critical Cluster suppliers, you are not 
leveraging major competitive advantage from the relationship. However, 
the positioning of the supplier within the category of Strategic Potential 
suggests that you could. The reason you are not doing so is that per-
formance is just average. You may even have tried to give the supplier 
opportunities to do more and provide more value to your business. But 
the supplier has not been able to perform when given those opportuni-
ties. In hindsight, those attempts were certainly not disasters but they left 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
52
a bit of a sour taste behind. The supplier may have slipped deadlines, there 
may have been some quality issues that were contained, or the resulting 
service or product may not have fully met customer expectations. You 
are now wary of offering further opportunities to the supplier along the 
same lines.
Based on this average performance, the supplier is now used for aver-
age tasks. It would be awarded with contracts for mainstream products 
and services that are not as exciting as the really-hot-and-new stuff the 
company stands for. That position may even give the supplier a fairly large 
chunk of the available business. So, superficially things will look good from 
a supplier perspective, and only a closer look at profit margins would 
reveal the untapped opportunities.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
The desired behavior to use with the Sustain supplier needs to be deter-
mined by the overall context. Provided that there are alternative suppliers 
that perform at a higher level and are positioned in Influence, there might 
not be the need to change a lot of things. In that case, the supplier would 
be encouraged to work on its performance with the company’s minimal 
involvement. After all, there are no major fixes needed and the company 
has learned to live with the few shortcomings the supplier has. Both par-
ties may be content with this status quo.
However, that may not be the case. You may feel that you really need 
more active innovation in the product areas that the supplier provides. 
This is more likely to occur if you have no Influence supplier in these areas. 
In this case, you would want to give the supplier far-more active encour-
agement to increase performance to world-class levels. If there already is 
an Influence supplier in these product areas, then you would not expend 
this effort. It would not be worth your while. You might even decide to 
encourage the Influence supplier to expand its scope. That would be a 
potential threat for the Sustain supplier.
How to Work with Sustain Suppliers
The challenge of working with Sustain suppliers is to strike the right 
balance between investment and return. When these suppliers recog-
nize what you value about working with them, they will be less likely to 
become complacent and allow their performance to slip or to present 
less desirable commercial terms to you. Always treat the Sustain supplier 
fairly while not tying up disproportionate resources. The relationship is 
likely to be relatively arm’s-length, with the supplier needing to compete 
for additional business. However, take care in this respect. Market and

performance changes can cause shifts in the relationship. Remaining suf-
ficiently close to the supplier will help you understand this dynamic and 
act accordingly.
Note
■
■
  Achieving the right balance between investment in a Sustain supplier and the return 
on that investment is a moving target. As the market and the supplier’s performance change, 
you will need to adjust the dial frequently to get the best results. That requires staying close to 
the supplier to make the right moves.
Governance 
Since there are probably dozens of suppliers in Sustain for an average 
company, the effort dedicated to managing the relationship for each needs 
to be kept at bay. For the majority of suppliers, the key platform for align-
ment will be quarterly reviews. In these reviews, the company will give 
the supplier feedback on its performance against a set of predetermined 
criteria. The supplier will then provide an update of key initiatives and 
progress against plan.
For Sustain suppliers that lack competitors in the Influence box, quarterly 
reviews still might be the right forum, but there should be a different 
emphasis in the message that is delivered to them. The company should 
outline very clear and specific expectations regarding what it takes to 
reach world-class performance.
Here, it is important to consider what improvements the company can 
realistically trigger in a Sustain supplier. Most likely, the Sustain supplier 
will provide a product or a service that is deemed essential for a certain 
industry. Therefore, this supplier will have working relationships with 
many customers in that industry and your company will not have an over-
whelming importance for it. Considering this, the company will not be 
able to provide more than a nudge to move in the direction of world-class 
performance. The main initiative and momentum needs to be created by 
the supplier on its own.
Case Example
Anyone driving through Riverside County up to Palm Springs, California, 
cannot help but be impressed by the large array of turbines in the San 
Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm. This gateway into the Coachella Valley is one of 
the windiest regions in Southern California. This wind farm contains more 
than 4,000 separate turbines and, with a capacity of 360 megawatts, provides 
enough electricity to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
54
San Gorgonio is by far not the largest wind farm in the world. California 
alone has two wind farms that are larger. The world record for onshore 
wind farms is currently held by the Gansu Wind Farm in China, with a 
capacity of 5,000 MW. The biggest offshore wind farm is the London 
Array with 630 MW. For comparison, the largest nuclear reactor in the 
world is currently being built in Olkiluoto, Finland. Once fully operational, 
its capacity will be 1,600 MW.
With many large wind farms under construction, let’s take a look at the 
relationship between the typical developer of a wind farm and the typical 
turbine maker. All starts with the developer identifying a suitable piece 
of land. The developer will begin by collecting detailed wind patterns by  
specific location, height, and day. The most desired outcome of these anal-
yses is steady wind throughout the year, not varying over day and night.
Based on the confirmed wind patterns, engineering consulting firms will 
then configure the wind park. By specific location, they will plan the most 
optimal turbine. Some locations within the wind park will be more suit-
able for tall and big turbines; others will be more suitable for smaller 
turbines on shorter towers.
On average, a wind turbine extracts 44 percent of the kinetic energy of 
the wind flowing through the turbine. The science is well understood and 
there is not much room for differentiation between the makers of turbines. 
With that, the typical turbine supplier would have average strategic poten-
tial and therefore fall into the middle column of the SRM framework.
In terms of performance, the overwhelming majority of turbine suppliers 
will fall into the average category. Given the volatile nature of the wind 
industry, it is challenging for suppliers to perform flawlessly. Wind farm 
projects are notoriously late. Normally, it takes the developer more time 
than expected to get all the required approvals and financing put in place. 
The turbine supplier can only wait and hope for the best. Usually, the 
order confirmation finally comes in when internal capacities are already 
booked for other contracts. This up and down makes it difficult to achieve 
process stability. In addition, local legislation often requires substantial 
modifications to the structural, electrical, and hydraulic components of 
the turbine.
The usual headaches for wind farm developers when dealing with tur-
bine suppliers are delivery delays, cost creeps, and quality problems. 
None of these usually get too serious and eventually every wind farm 
gets up and running.
The relationship between the developer and the turbine supplier usually 
does not become very close. From the developer’s point of view, identi-
fying the right piece of land, matching turbine types with wind patterns, 
getting the approvals, and securing the financing are the core activities, and 
www.it-ebooks.info

the turbine supplier comes in after all of those steps are taken care of. So 
when the turbine supplier is ramping up, the developer is already ramping 
down. Of course, operational personnel from the developer will monitor 
the supplier to ensure that it is delivering to specification.
In summary, the relationship between the wind farm developer and the 
turbine supplier fits into the Sustain supplier interaction model squarely. 
The supplier is essential to the developer, but at least from today’s tech-
nological point of view, there is no way to fundamentally differentiate and 
to create a winning ecosystem. With the volatile environment in the busi-
ness, chances are that the developer will hardly ever be enthusiastic about 
the performance of the supplier but will regard it as necessary.
Heartland Begins to Deploy TrueSRM
As the restructuring of procurement was coming toward a close, 
Laura started to turn her attention more to how the TrueSRM 
framework would be deployed. As part of the restructuring, 
Laura had created a very small central function in procurement 
that had responsibility for tools and processes. This was now 
led by Blair Worden, reporting directly to Laura in her role 
as procurement COO. Blair had joined procurement from 
Heartland’s finance function, where he had previously been the 
commercial finance head for the European business. He was 
charged with implementing the framework. Given the importance 
of TrueSRM to the business, however, Laura maintained a very 
strong interest in the detail. Blair brought a perspective beyond 
procurement. Although he was a career finance professional, he 
had also held previous roles in marketing and IT, and he was on 
Heartland’s fast-track development path.
Blair inherited the initial rough supplier segmentation that had 
been carried out to support the original activity analysis that had 
prompted the decision to restructure. Laura and Blair decided to 
take a strong, top-down approach to reviewing the segmentation 
rather than the very bottom-up, category-by-category approach 
that often leads to each category vying to name suppliers in the 
Critical Cluster. While this may make sense for the individual 
category, it rarely works from a corporate perspective and can 
lead to the perverse result of facilities suppliers, for example, 
being classified as Integrate. Laura and Blair decided to work 
through each interaction model one by one, both to validate 
the suppliers that were classified in it and to drive the right 
interventions that would need to be executed by the category 
leaders responsible for it.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
56
They chose to start in the Ordinaries cluster. Laura felt that 
Thomas did not need to be involved in any significant way here, 
although other functional leaders would clearly be very much 
part of the implementation.
After the Improve suppliers, Sustain was the most populous 
model. Laura and Blair convened in Laura’s office to discuss what 
to do. Addressing the groups was actually surprisingly tricky.
Laura laid out her perspective: “We really don’t want to put too 
much effort into these guys,” she said, referring to the Sustain 
suppliers. “But they do have more value to us than the Improve 
suppliers. I mean some of our major IT vendors sit here.”
“I agree,” said Blair. “I am sure some of them could contribute 
far more to our business than they do currently. We need to 
encourage and support them to do this but not at the expense of 
disproportionate effort our side.”
“We need to nudge them,” added Laura.
“I think that mandating some very clear scorecards that show 
our view of them, with a clear message, would work here,” Blair 
suggested.
“We need to keep it simple, though,” said Laura. “I do not want 
to create a paper chase with people pursuing metrics, reconciling 
numbers, and debating statistics. That would defeat what we are 
trying to achieve.”
Blair thought for a moment or two. He then added: “Maybe we 
just make it very transparent to them how we see their position. 
We communicate that there are issues that have prevented us 
from awarding them more business and that they need to up their 
game if they are to continue with us.”
“Yes, a simple score card that records our view of them is probably 
enough. We can combine that with a quarterly review session 
that the suppliers lead and a business representative attends. 
The review session will also give the opportunity for a two-way 
dialogue, and for the supplier to explain its perspective.”
“OK.” said Blair. “I will start to contact the category leaders to 
make that happen. We might also want to think about providing 
some training so as to help the category leaders treat the reviews 
as genuine two-way dialogues rather than pure information-
giving sessions.”
“Good idea. Let’s capture that,” agreed Laura. “I am sure we 
will also have additional training needs as we go through the 
other models. Harvest is next . . . .”

Characteristics of Harvest Suppliers
Harvest suppliers are typically thinner on the ground than the other 
Ordinaries. For a company with 1,000 suppliers, we would not expect to 
find more than a couple of dozen of them in this interaction model.
Suppliers in Harvest (Figure 5-3) can be seen as “unsung heroes.” Their 
performance is excellent but the actual potential relationship value is 
low. They supply goods or services that the company needs to have but 
that are not highly critical to its commercial success. The most basic 
cross-industry example of a Harvest supplier might be the distributor of 
stationery to the company’s offices; it always happens on time, the cost 
performance is fine, and if it stopped everyone would notice. But, there is 
not some great yearning need for the customer to tap greater value from 
the relationship through innovation. Indeed, if the supplier did innovate 
significantly, we may not even notice or might struggle to see the value.

Figure 5-3.  Harvest suppliers on the strategy/performance axes
So, despite its strong performance, this supplier has not made it into the 
innermost circle of suppliers from the perspective of the company. Nor 
can it ever hope to. Mature and sensible Harvest suppliers realize that 
this is the reality and manage accordingly. They are used to their status as 
unsung heroes and focus on performance as the only way to retain and win 
additional contracts. Their share of wallet with any individual customer 
can vary significantly. The common feature is that Harvest suppliers oper-
ate in category areas that are usually not strategic for the business, such 
as telecommunications, facilities management, and utilities. These are all 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
58
areas that for most businesses are essential services that are noticed if 
they fail but for which there is no real need to drive exclusive innovation. 
Accordingly, the Harvest suppliers focus on serving a very large number 
of customers to build scale and to hedge their bets in case any particular 
customer chooses to stop working with them. They will value their rela-
tionship with you but will typically not overinvest in it.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
The desired behavior of the Harvest suppliers needs to be determined 
in the overall context. Assuming you have correctly determined that the 
potential relationship value is low, then the desired behavior is to “carry 
on as is.” There is no need to change anything nor to rock the boat.
This means that you need the Harvest supplier to maintain its current 
strong performance and not to falter. You need it to value the relationship 
with you sufficiently enough that it is incentivized to continue to perform.
How to Work with Harvest Suppliers
Whereas the trick to working with Sustain suppliers is to invest enough 
effort in the relationship to maintain the performance level while not 
inadvertently sending a signal that you want to “partner,” most Harvest 
suppliers are sufficiently mature that they will continue to perform with 
very limited encouragement from the customer. They are used to doing 
this for a large number of other customers too and will happily do the 
same for you if you let them. Harvest suppliers are also used to having 
to justify their continued presence through competitive tender; the pos-
sible threat of which (if not overdone) can provide a continued goad to 
best-in-class performance on quality, service, and economic dimensions.
Things tend to go wrong when individual buyers in companies overfocus 
on the relationship and miscommunicate the true position. This sometimes 
happens when customers apply supplier segmentation at a category level 
and do not force an organization-wide calibration. We have seen situations 
where well-performing suppliers of mundane items get wrongly labeled as 
partners. This is often as a result of overenthusiastic category managers 
in nonstrategic categories wanting to apply partnership approaches inap-
propriately. Such behavior inevitably leads eventually to frustration and 
misalignment on both sides. In particular, the Harvest supplier may mis-
interpret such signals as an indication that it can charge a premium price 
beyond that which is justified by its strong performance and competitive 
advantage in its category. Ultimately, this would be self-defeating.
Harvest suppliers illustrate in the most extreme case the broad injunction 
associated with the Ordinaries cluster, “Leave well enough alone.”

Tip
■
■
  Value your Harvest suppliers and praise them when appropriate as the unsung heroes 
they are. But do not encourage them to think of themselves as partners. In most cases, the 
products they offer are not important, strategic inputs to your key initiatives.
Governance 
Typically, biannual reviews will be sufficient platforms for governance. In these 
reviews, the company will give the supplier feedback on its performance 
against a set of predetermined criteria. It will also give encouragement that 
continued strong performance will be rewarded and that reduced perfor-
mance can be dealt with through competition.
We would not expect the governance discussions to go beyond these 
points. There is neither a significant need for you to discuss initiatives 
that will build the relationship nor to involve senior leadership other than 
specific functional experts such as the head of facilities. Depending on its 
actual scale of business with you, the Harvest supplier may involve senior 
executives from its side, but you need not be tempted to match this in 
most normal situations.
The real challenge with managing the governance meetings is to stay focused 
on the themes that matter for this interaction model. Overenthusiasm 
needs to be reined in on both sides. This will avoid frustration and inap-
propriate behavior. Typically, candor that the supplier is in the Harvest 
state will be helpful as part of these forums. An intelligent Harvest sup-
plier will not push back on this but will welcome the clarity that you are 
providing.
Case Example
Let’s consider a mundane example of a service that every business 
requires: facilities management. This is an essential service that involves 
ensuring facilities are cleaned, guarded, and maintained properly. It also 
often includes energy management. Usually, this is something that senior 
executives do not want to spend time thinking about. A number of differ-
ent organizations offer “service”-based solutions. Typically, these suppli-
ers each have a large number of customers whose share of wallet will vary 
based on the characteristics of the business. The category is also highly 
competitive and the service level is critical. Poor performance can lead to 
contract cancellation—although usually customers seek to avoid this if 
they can, given the costs of dislocation that would be incurred.

Chapter 5 | The “Ordinaries” 
60
If one looks at the sales messages of the suppliers concerned, the whole 
pitch is associated with outsourcing a headache so that you as a customer 
do not have to worry about it. These suppliers understand their core 
business model. They give messages associated with “quiet efficiency,” 
“supporting businesses,” and “one-stop shopping”—focusing on how to 
make life easy for their customers.
Innovation from these suppliers is focused on taking these service-related 
concepts still further to enable you as a customer to worry even less 
about the category in the future. They drive the innovation themselves 
for all of their customers and it does not need your help or input to cre-
ate, although you may need to take some action in order to tap into it. An 
example of this would be a top-performing facilities supplier that brings 
to you as a customer a smart metering solution that enables energy con-
sumption to be controlled. This would ideally be combined with bidirec-
tional control and data analytics to ensure that energy-usage policies can 
be optimized, set, and consistently implemented across your estate. Such 
solutions can lead to double-digit percentage savings in energy consump-
tion. Valuable as these savings are, they do not lead to a game-changing 
improvement in the competitiveness of the end product for the vast 
majority of companies. Furthermore, the supplier has no incentive in any 
event to offer an individual customer some form of exclusivity or unique 
advantage even if you do value its service. In its market, it needs to serve 
everyone equally well and must “play the field” in order to create scale 
and profit.
The supplier doing this work will be high performing but is still in the 
Harvest category in terms of relationship potential; it performs strongly 
in its function and its failure would be rapidly noticed, but there is no real 
opportunity for the customer to broaden the relationship as a way to 
obtain significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Heartland Scales Back Overinvestment  
of Time
Laura and Blair were now considering the Harvest suppliers. 
One of the suppliers included on the top-down segmentation 
was Facilities R Us, the office-facilities supplier that organized 
cleaning and washroom services for Heartland. Laura fixed her 
gaze on the supplier: “It makes sense that we classified it as 
Harvest,” she said. “I know that it performs very well and we 
never seem to have any issues.”
www.it-ebooks.info

“The category team talks about it as a ‘strategic partner’ though,” 
commented Blair. “The team and the corporate-services function 
see Facilities R Us as contributing huge amounts of value-added 
input. I know that they have lots of meetings with the supplier. 
There was even an Innovation Day last year.”
“Yes,” said Laura. “This is one of the cases where there is 
overinvestment in and too much effort being spent on this 
supplier. It is supplying something pretty basic very well, but it 
does not contribute to how we grow the top line.”
“Do you think it is our fault, or theirs, that there is all this effort?” 
Blair asked her.
“Probably six of one and a half dozen of the other. I always 
believe that you get the supplier behavior that you deserve. I 
suspect that Facilities R Us is responding to the steering we 
have given it as a customer. We are a large account for them. 
The company’s sales manager will no doubt be very happy to 
attend any meeting we want to set up and quite frankly indulge 
our whims. The point is that we need to be more focused and 
disciplined as a business here. Facilities R Us delivers well 
but we create process around it that is excessive and probably 
distracting more than anything else. ”
“Yes,” agreed Blair. “I am sure we will find the same thing with 
other Harvest suppliers.”
“We need to scale back the meetings here, recognize the 
mundaneness of what the supplier is doing, and allow it to do 
its job. I also suspect the company is incurring excess cost to 
support this account, and its chances of winning real incremental 
business are low. I mean it is a facilities business, and it has our 
core contract. There is not really anything else to give them.”
“I will work with the category team to get this in shape,” Blair 
resolved. “We need to communicate to the supplier how we 
really see the company. Then they can get on with the job we 
really want done.”
Blair then thought for a second and added: “Say, if the company 
can cut down on the effort it has to devote to managing us, then 
perhaps we ought to be asking for better commercial terms to 
reflect that, too?”
Laura laughed. “Maybe we should,” she said, “but not 
straightaway, I think!”

Rethink Relations with Ordinaries
In this chapter, we have described the three interaction models that 
characterize the Ordinaries. As we have seen, these will constitute the 
vast majority of suppliers to your business. The trick for managing these 
suppliers is to balance the level of investment you put into the relation-
ship with the potential returns.
We started with the Ordinaries precisely because we do not want to 
ignore them. It is all too easy to do that when one turns to the other 
clusters that distinguish themselves more readily. This distinction is a 
positive one for the Critical Cluster because of the high potential value 
you can achieve from working with them. It is negative in the case of the 
Problematics, where serious fixes are needed.
We will turn our attention in Chapter 6 to the challenging Problematic 
Suppliers. We will then address the grassy uplands of the Critical Cluster 
in Chapter 7.

“Problem 
Children”
Addressing Problematic Supplier Relationships
From a psychological point of view, children are often called problem 
­children if they are not able to manage everyday challenges and problems, 
or if they are not performing as expected in their environment.
It is already a given in science that problem children are not always 
­suffering from a disease; on the contrary, these children often tend to be 
highly intelligent. It is important to understand the real root causes. They 
are not able to show their potential because they are not challenged and 
valued enough. Their capabilities need to be fostered and promoted. They 
need support and should be sponsored to perform successfully.
The other case that occurs is that these problem children are just too 
slow to keep up with their peer group. Sometimes this is just because of 
laziness.
It is really difficult for parents to distinguish which group the child belongs 
in—and determining that is exactly the art in the diagnosis. The same 
­principles are true for the bottom group in the supplier interaction matrix, 
Mitigate, Develop, and Bail Out.
Suppliers in each of these models have important characteristics in 
common:
1.	 Their current performance is very low.
2.	 They need significant care and risk management.

The analogy to the children just mentioned holds here as well: some are 
lazy, some are having real problems, and some are super smart but choosing 
not to show their capabilities. Yet you must be able to assess the strategic 
value that the supplier brings. This is the key challenge. Is the supplier the 
highly intelligent child, with great innovations or new technologies used 
on behalf of their client companies but just overstrained in daily business? 
In this case, considering this supplier a Bail Out would make sense to 
­utilize the strategic potential as competitive advantage. If the performance 
of a well-known supplier with very limited strategic potential is sluggish, 
then tagging that supplier a Mitigate is the answer. The supplier needs to 
understand that either it improves and rises to the occasion or it is out.  
If we find that a supplier has performance somewhere in between low and 
high strategic potential, then Develop could be the best interaction model 
to place it in. This would mean that the supplier will be nurtured so as to 
perform more effectively.
The competitive advantage of successful companies—just as with ­successful 
psychologists—is that they identify very fast which type of problem child 
they have in front of them and they make immediate, rigorous decisions 
on the way forward.
Characteristics of Mitigate Suppliers
Mitigate is an area of the SRM framework where we normally find around 
5 percent of all suppliers. For a company with 1,000 suppliers, we would 
accordingly expect to find dozens of suppliers in this interaction model.
In general, suppliers in Mitigate (Figure 6-1) have low strategic potential. 
The products and services they provide represent no clear differentiat-
ing factor for the company’s position in the market. While the majority 
of suppliers share this characteristic, those in Mitigate need much closer 
attention than those in Improve or Harvest.

The lack of strategic potential is not the most critical aspect that requires 
application of the “up or out” rule. The real challenge is that Mitigate 
­suppliers have severe performance issues. Delivery, cost, and/or qual-
ity show permanent shortcomings over time. This is why the downside 
potential with such suppliers is tremendous. We find this position in all 
sorts of suppliers. Quite often, they are large suppliers with commoditized 
products and may even be long-lasting relationships. The overall attention 
that the supplier gives you decreases, however, as they pursue and acquire 
emerging new customers. Alternatively, they just become complacent.
Based on the low strategic value and poor performance, there is an imme-
diate need for action. The supplier needs to understand it has to improve 
performance—to move “up”—or it will be replaced—moved “out.” This 
is why a solid contingency plan for replacement is an integrated element 
of this interaction model.
Needless to say, a large portion of risk management is closely linked with 
this area of SRM. This is done to mitigate both the consequences of poor 
performance and the dislocation issues associated with replacement.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
While most of the other interaction models have one clear desired 
­behavior, there are a couple of options in this case. Specifically, we need to 
distinguish between the up behavior and the out behavior for the supplier. 
The supplier commonly needs to understand the necessity for chang-
ing its behavior and the consequences related to it. Of course, the most 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
66
desired behavior for Mitigate is a supplier that improves and delivers a 
solid performance and improves shortcomings in a very short period of 
time without the company’s involvement. But what if the supplier either 
fails or is not willing to improve, and so needs to be replaced?
In that case, the desired behavior is for the supplier to remain ­professional, 
transparent, and open in the replacement and in the transition period. At 
least some of the performance issues need to be stabilized, requiring some 
short-term fixes. Some significant oversight by the company is necessary 
in the replacement phase—on the one hand to fix the issues for the next 
supplier and on the other hand to ensure a smooth transition.
Paradoxically, the quality of such a relationship—even though it is ending—
is one of the most important ones in SRM because you need to maintain a 
level of openness and clarity while you are still working together.
Note

  When you have decided to switch to a different supplier, you and the incumbent both 
need to operate with clarity and good intentions. When a supplier knows it is being edged out, 
that’s not the easiest situation to handle for either party.
How to Work with Mitigate Suppliers
Suppliers in Mitigate are given a final chance to improve, but there will 
be very limited guidance because they are simply not worth the effort. 
The dissatisfaction with the supplier needs to be communicated and fact 
based. The supplier needs to clearly understand how serious the situation 
is. Then, you give it an opportunity to improve. If they do not take it, you 
need to move them out.
While the up portion of this interaction model is very much about 
­suppliers improving performance on their own, the challenge is the 
out portion. The main ingredient to being successful in this interaction 
model is ­transparency. You especially need to understand interdependen-
cies across different lines of business/business units or within different 
­categories. The impact of bringing in a potential replacement needs to be 
intelligently evaluated. Be aware that, for example, some of the supporting 
processes or services of the supplier are not always obvious. A potential 
exit needs to be aligned and supported by stakeholders. Guidance for this 
alignment will most probably be scenarios, business cases, and contin-
gency plans based on an anticipated supplier reaction.
For example, you need to be prepared for the supplier to become even 
less focused on your needs in this period. The team that has currently 
been serving your needs within the organization may gravitate to different 
www.it-ebooks.info

67
customers, for example. Performance may degrade still further. You need 
to be prepared for these eventualities and be able to ramp up a replace-
ment option more quickly than originally expected.
Once the supplier receives word of the transition, your desire is that 
this will fulfill all remaining business obligations and articulate steps for 
handing off the business to a new supplier rather than create problems. 
Typically, you would agree on a joint transition plan that will be executed 
by the supplier being replaced in cooperation with the new supplier. 
Usually, ­suppliers manage exits professionally. It is bad for their reputation 
to cause intentional problems. Issues tend to be most likely when the 
supplier being replaced is relatively small and is either captive to you or 
has a small number of customers in total. In this situation, the supplier’s 
wider reputation is less important for it and it has more to lose by being 
replaced. The risk of a tricky exit is consequently higher.
Once the transition plan is in place and being executed, the most impor-
tant—but also the most difficult—success factor in the transition is to 
remain professional. Displays of emotions on both the supplier and the 
buyer side are inappropriate. Be sure to get a view on the supplier’s inner 
state; the supplier needs to be as transparent as a pane of glass.
Last but not least, it is key not to leave a battlefield behind. Keep the rela-
tionship alive with a view for future business. Usually, the supplier will be 
keen to do this, too.
Governance 
As each company has dozens of suppliers in Mitigate, we have to ­distinguish 
between the effort related to Mitigate in the up and the out sections. 
As we have already discussed, the positioning of a supplier in Mitigate 
can become really critical for the company and fast actions need to be 
readied. In most cases, there is no time to wait for a quarterly or annual 
review meeting. You need to get into contact with the supplier once the 
shortcomings are realized. The purpose will be to ask the supplier to 
provide a mitigation plan against which its performance improvement will 
be measured.
In those cases where the supplier is not able to realize an up, the transition 
comes into place. In the transition, it is key to ask the supplier to update 
you on every aspect of the phasing out. Depending on the scope and the 
expected time of replacement, it makes sense to have regular meetings 
with the supplier just as you would with a state-of-the-art project man-
agement team. This encompasses aspects such as achievements to date, 
identified obstacles, problems, and mitigation planning. Most meetings of 
this type only take place between the existing supplier and the client,  
www.it-ebooks.info

68
but it turns out to be much more effective if the new supplier is involved, 
too. Supplier facilities, inventory levels, order volumes, or quality fulfill-
ments need to be monitored closely as part of integrated risk management 
during the implementation. If severe problems occur during the transition, 
a task force has to be put in place at the supplier to secure supply.
Case Example
When you had your last yogurt, did you think about the complexity of 
the box and the lid? Probably not. Nevertheless, a yogurt lid is something 
quite interesting and manufacturing one could cause a lot of trouble with 
the supplier. Some background on the lid: the structure is mainly based on 
aluminum, printing ink, lacquers, and a layer of varnish.
Varnish is a mostly glossy or semiglossy, transparent finish that is used to 
protect and to finish. It normally has no color pigments in it. Ingredients of 
varnishes are kept highly confidential. In general, their production is not a 
rocket science and the type of varnish used is in most cases not a differ-
entiating factor. End customers do not even know that there are different 
varieties. What’s more, the yogurt producers do not care about the ­varnish 
producer. The varnish is supplied to a flexible packaging manufacturer that 
then supplies the yogurt producer. So, is the varnish quite a simple prod-
uct? Is it then easy to change varnish suppliers? Not risky at all?
Generally speaking, for varnishes this is true, but it is much more compli-
cated if you look further into this specific case. In yogurts, the varnish has 
contact with food, and as some people tend to have the habit to lick the 
yogurt from the lid, they are also in direct contact with the varnish, mean-
ing that the varnish needs to have FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) 
approval. The FDA’s approvals of the products it regulates are as varied as 
the products themselves. These differences are dictated by the laws the 
FDA enforces and the relative risks that the products pose to consumers. 
Beside FDA approval, another thing to know is that varnishes show differ-
ent reactions over time. Even with sophisticated laboratory methods, it is 
not possible to simulate. Long-term tests must be undertaken.
Given these facts, the suppliers of varnish to flexible packaging producers 
tend to consider themselves as being in a very secure position. This is 
not because of the uniqueness of the product itself but because approval 
processes for new products limit a buyer’s choices. The strategic value of 
the supplier is therefore rather limited, but the downside potential if the 
supplier causes trouble is quite high.
With this background in mind, one varnish supplier started a danger-
ous journey. It increased prices step-by-step—in some negotiation rounds 
even double digit. But the service quality of the supplier was decreasing 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
69
and delivery issues started. The customer was obliged to hold significant 
inventory levels of varnish in order to overcome bottlenecks. Up to this 
point it had done so, since it was clear that no varnish means no produc-
tion. When the supplier threatened to stop supply, the customer ­realized 
that it was time to deliver an up or out message. Even the supplier’s 
­biggest supporters in production supported this approach.
The supplier was invited to a meeting with the management team and 
its shortcomings were made transparent. The potential consequences, 
like switching away from varnish for new products or even a complete 
shift to another provider for all products, were not taken seriously by the 
supplier.
This laissez-faire attitude was not a sensible philosophy. After two months 
with no improvement, the supplier was informed that it was being replaced. 
Of course, the customer did not only wait but used the time wisely to 
prepare the phaseout. The transparency that was created made clear that 
not only the yogurt lids were affected by a potential shift but also some 
other products ordered from the same supplier that had the varnish in 
their specifications. In total, approximately 3,000 recipes the customer 
produced for different clients were affected by the replacement.
A transition plan was created for all products. In addition, suppliers that 
were identified to be replacements were partly involved. The supplier 
was a bit surprised and shocked that the replacement scenario came into 
place and was taken seriously by the customer. During the replacement 
meeting, as a reaction the management of the supplier showed willingness 
to commit to improve performance, but as previous promises did not 
show the desired effect, the customer did not change its decision. In the 
end, the management of the supplier promised to support the transition 
process professionally. It kept that promise.
The supplier contributed to and formally signed the detailed transition 
plan and agreed to regular reviews. The process was only marred by 
an attempt on the part of the supplier’s sales manager to raise prices. 
This was refused after escalation on the customer side. After 18 months, 
the transition was complete. The company saved one-third of its origi-
nal spending on varnish and got access to an innovative and highly moti-
vated supplier, which did not just copy the former varnish but improved 
the specifications to achieve better workability and longer duration. This 
made the engineering department happy, because while it supported the 
process, it was a bit skeptical as to whether the company was making the 
right move.
In summary, the relationship between the customer and the varnish  
supplier was clearly in the Mitigate supplier interaction model. The sup-
plier was not performing in terms of price and delivery performance.

After being prewarned several times, the supplier was replaced and a 
detailed transition plan was executed. Because of how professionally the 
transition was executed, there was surprisingly little bad blood on either 
side. In fact, the varnish supplier undertook major internal soul-searching 
as a result of this experience. It has made a conscious effort to up its 
game elsewhere. In fact, it is even tendering again to win work with the 
customer that replaced it.
TrueSRM Comes to Marketing
As part of implementing TrueSRM at Heartland, Procurement 
initiated reviews with each key part of the business to review 
the supplier positioning and agree on the actions. Laura attended 
several of the sessions personally. The marketing meeting was 
particularly fascinating. Scarlet, in her role as chief marketing 
officer, attended along with Jane Cavendish from Laura’s team, 
who was responsible for marketing procurement. A number of 
members of Scarlet’s team also attended the session; in fact, it 
ended up as quite a crowd, which was not unusual for marketing 
meetings.
Laura had taken the precaution of having a premeeting with 
Scarlet to discuss the ideas that Procurement was about to put 
on the table. Scarlet was receptive but she wanted her team 
to be taken on the journey rather than for her to dictate an 
outcome to them. The big elephant in the room was that despite 
its commitment to strategic sourcing, Heartland had not run a 
full creative agency pitch for some years. This was an area that 
Thomas had chosen not to tackle as CPO; there had been bigger 
issues to deal with.
But there was an increasing sense that Heartland was not getting 
what it needed from the agency relationship and that a change 
might be needed. This had nothing to do with cost but all to 
do with the level of creative input that the agency was giving. 
Quite frankly, Heartland’s advertising lacked the freshness of 
Calbury’s, which had won plaudits for making consumers feel 
good in very simple ways—like the famous example of a gorilla 
playing the drums to the strains of the ’60s Matt Monro hit 
“Walk Away.” Almost unbelievably, this had accounted for a big 
sales increase. Delta Creative, Heartland’s advertising agency, 
was nowhere near providing this level of creativity. The whole 
advertising package was very stale. However, not all of Scarlet’s 
team shared this view, even though Scarlet was sympathetic with 
the view that a change was in order.

Supplier Relationship Management
71
The first minor hiccup to be conveyed in the marketing meeting 
was that the marketing people were surprised that no suppliers 
were shown as belonging to the Critical Cluster in the top 
right-hand quadrant of Laura’s Three Clusters model, which 
she presented to the team projected on a screen showing the 
interaction models and their supplier plots. Jane explained that 
the categorization was from a corporate perspective rather than a 
pure functional one. In this light, it had been hard to think of any 
existing marketing supplier as strongly supporting Heartland’s 
competitive advantage. It was felt that even Delta Creative 
really only carried out a workman-like role rather than one that 
strongly differentiated Heartland. The company was accordingly 
positioned as Sustain. Even Scarlet’s marketing team accepted 
this view after some discussion, during which Laura had to 
intervene a couple of times in support of Jane.
After a brief coffee break, Laura decided to go on the offensive: 
“Shouldn’t the creative agency be doing more than a workman-
like job?” she exclaimed. “I wonder if something needs to be 
done about it. We have positioned the company as Sustain, 
but I wonder whether we should really be more aggressive. Its 
performance does not seem very good at all from what I am 
hearing. Also, it is not clear that it is attracting the right creative 
talent, which would mean it could turn things around. Its strategic 
potential feels limited to me, too.”
Laura boldly walked up to the screen showing the interaction 
models and their supplier plots. She pointed to the bottom  
left-hand corner and ventured: “Why don’t we just face reality? 
Delta Creative is a Mitigate supplier, which means we really need 
to replace it. That is the logic of what we’re talking about.”
For a few moments, there was silence in the room, as everyone 
took a sharp intake of breath to contemplate what Laura had 
said. Then, Dean Everley, Scarlet’s head of marketing, spoke in 
his thick Tennessee accent: “Laura,” he drawled, “I think you 
might have a point. Delta Creative is getting a bit long in the 
tooth. Its creative pipeline is poor and it sees us as a cash cow. 
Maybe we should replace it and get another agency with newer 
ideas, a company that is hungry to serve Heartland. I’m not sure 
we want drumming gorillas, but we sure don’t want the nonsense 
we are currently producing. What do y’all think?”
The dam had well and truly burst. Dean had voiced what others 
were thinking but could not bring themselves to articulate. The 
relationship with Delta had gone on so long that no one relished 
the idea of replacing them and losing some genuine friendships. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
72
There was general agreement though that Delta Creative did 
need to be replaced. Scarlet had been prepared to force the issue 
herself if necessary but was happy that the team got there without 
her pushing them.
The public announcement that would follow saying that 
Heartland was reconsidering its creative agency relationships 
was big news in the marketing press, given the size of the account 
and the longevity of the relationship with Delta Creative. Out of 
fairness, Delta was given the opportunity to participate in the 
pitch. But its underperformance counted against the company 
and they lost the contract. Heartland put in place a transition 
plan and, to be fair, Delta played its role in the transition 
professionally. The separation was as amicable as it could be 
under the circumstances. However, it was no longer a supplier 
to Heartland.
Delta learned from the experience and later won business with 
two other smaller and less complex accounts; it vowed not to 
take them for granted the way it had with Heartland.
Characteristics of Develop Suppliers
Develop suppliers are typically thinner on the ground compared to the 
rest of the Problematic Suppliers. For a company with 1,000 suppliers,  
we would not expect to find more than a handful of suppliers in this 
interaction model. You would not wish to see too many suppliers in this 
model because that would be indicative of an overall poorly performing 
supply base.
Generally speaking, suppliers in Develop (Figure 6-2) could become inter-
esting and promising because their strategic potential is slightly higher 
than that of the vast majority of suppliers working with the company. 
The products and services these suppliers provide could become impor-
tant for the company’s position in the market. The potential needs to be 
tapped by identifying opportunities across the value chain of both the 
supplier and the company. One thing is clear: the supplier is currently not 
ready for prime time but it has the potential to become a star supplier in 
the future.

Figure 6-2.  Develop suppliers
Suppliers in Develop can also be found in those who have severe opera-
tional problems and show performance that is in the back quartile of all 
suppliers. Yet there is something about them—a spark, an enthusiasm—
that separates them from Mitigates. Their poor performance needs to 
be addressed. It is not a disaster if such a supplier fails but just a lost 
opportunity.
Recurring performance issues are the reason why there is no competi-
tive advantage and a lack of operational benefits at the moment for the 
Develop supplier. These issues can be fixed in a way that the company 
benefits from a supplier. There are numerous examples of Develop  
suppliers that became key resources in well-managed relationships.
Consider, for example, the many manufacturers that nurture low-cost 
country suppliers by providing technology or engineering assistance to 
get them up to speed as component suppliers. Imagine that the supplier 
fixes its operational problems, which brings great benefit and competitive 
advantage to these manufacturers—mostly in terms of cost, but also in 
terms of technology improvements.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
The desired behavior of the Develop supplier needs to be discussed in the 
context of future business opportunities. The supplier needs to perceive 
a unique chance to grow significantly and needs to be willing to follow a 
given development plan. It is required that the supplier is open to working 
with the company’s people across its organization.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
74
A triangle of trust, confidence, and commitment needs to be in place. The 
supplier needs trust in the growth opportunity and in the company itself, 
and believe that the support will be to its benefit. The project leader-
ship in the Develop interaction model from the supplier’s side has to be 
confident that the operational improvements are achievable because the 
supplier has to drive the improvement.
This leads us to the idea of commitment. Speaking about Develop, with 
some significant benefit for both sides, it is not something that should 
be managed as just another initiative by a key account manager. Given 
the major strategic impact, the management needs to be committed to 
drive this improvement. The supplier needs to allocate core resources for 
improving engineering, manufacturing, quality, or operational capabilities.
The supplier should be encouraged to work on its performance with 
quite a bit of involvement by the company. The recommendations of 
these resources need to be implemented.
How to Work with Develop Suppliers
The key challenge of working with Develop suppliers is to identify the 
right organizations, those able to accept the challenge of becoming an 
important supplier. Because these suppliers receive significant support, 
there needs to be the right balance between investment and return in this 
relationship.
The conversation with this supplier should start with the presentation of 
a business case and a plan that reflects the interest of both parties. The 
­supplier should also be made aware of the potential volume allocation for 
the future. The objective is to motivate the supplier to change its setup and 
processes. As the supplier needs to allocate core resources, the ­company 
itself also needs to dedicate core resources to improving the supplier’s 
engineering, manufacturing, quality, or broader operational capabilities. 
These joint teams will align and set standards for future interaction.
Note
■
■
  Make sure that any changes are communicated fairly with the Develop supplier, even 
if—or better, especially if—changes in the original business plan or volume allocation occur. 
If market rumors reach the supplier about your company, the relationship will be significantly 
harmed.

Governance 
Reach out to your in-house, cross-functional teams to identify viable 
­candidates for being a Develop supplier. Your business needs and the 
strategic potential of the supplier need to be aligned.
After having handpicked the relevant supplier, a supplier meeting should 
be set up that encompasses not only the traditional supplier’s salespeople 
and your company’s procurement people but also other functions like 
engineering, manufacturing, quality and operational capabilities, and most 
important: the management.
When both parties have the same understanding of the future and the 
motivation to turn Develop into a beneficial interaction, the collaboration 
begins and joint teams start working. The Develop effort needs to be 
executed as a rigorous project with clear reporting and milestone track-
ing. The supplier’s performance has to be monitored closely and regular 
biweekly meetings need to be set up.
Finally, once both parties are aiming for the same goal, performance needs 
to be monitored by cascading objectives down to every employee level 
affected by the new relationship.
Case Example
Everybody driving a car thinks about the design, the engine, the invest-
ment cost and ongoing cost, the color, and potentially about the envi-
ronmental effects in terms of sustainability. Hardly any customer thinks 
about the steel that is in the car, even if we observe that a car consists of 
approximately 50–55 percent steel.
Some might say that steel cannot be the real challenge in ­supplier-company 
relationships because there are many steel producers on the market. In 
our estimation, there are about 130 serious suppliers. All these produc-
ers are either producing blast furnaces with iron ore, coking coal, scrap, 
oxygen, or alloys, or in the case of electric arc furnaces mainly with scrap. 
Production technology is asset intensive.
Depending on the alloys and the production process, steel types have dif-
ferent functions and can be used for different purposes. It is quite obvious 
that railway tracks, construction steel, or steel for big ships fulfill other 
specifications than automotive steel. Automotive steel is one of the most 
sophisticated types of steel. The requirements from automotive OEMs 
are high, as the automotive steel needs to cover the balance between 
elongation and yield strengths. This means, on the one hand, it should be 
good in terms of formability to be able to fulfill all design aspects. On the 
other hand, it should have enough stiffness to have a maximum of security

for the driver and passengers in the car should it crash. In addition, the 
flat steel portion of a car requires hot-dip galvanizing, which itself requires 
some experience and also additional investments.
As a consequence, there are only a very few suppliers in the world that 
are able to fulfill automotive steel requirements and even fewer steel 
­producers that are able to fulfill them for the premium carmakers.
China is the fastest-growing automotive market. From 2013 to 2020, the 
number of cars in the country is expected to double. Sales are expected 
to be around 30 million cars in 2020. The car manufacturers are well 
aware of this situation and have created new production facilities in Asia 
and especially in China. This will secure growth while keeping roots in 
the saturated markets. But the new facilities also create some challenges 
in terms of supply. The same growth story creating pressure on supply 
is true for steel. In former times, there was no supplier that was able to 
produce automotive steel in China.
One of the automotive companies realized this situation of constrained 
supply quite quickly. This was after having imported the required steel 
from other countries at a high cost. It then started screening the supplier 
market in China for steel. About 60 mills were identified that would have 
had the size to play in this market. A handful of suppliers had already 
made their first attempts to go into automotive, but without any success. 
The goal of the automotive OEM was to work with a Develop supplier 
to have a source in the country that could produce steel at Western 
European automotive standards. The company already had a relationship 
with two suppliers for certain steel parts by that time, but the satisfaction 
level with their overall performance was limited.
Nevertheless, top management meetings were set up with both compa-
nies to create an understanding of the future mutual benefits and how the 
OEM would invest its own resources to develop this supplier. A business 
case was created and showed that the overall tonnage in the optimistic 
scenario would have filled about 15 percent of the overall capacity of 
one of the suppliers for years. Interestingly enough, the first reaction of 
the companies was not excitement as was expected. China’s economy 
was growing fast and there were significant investments in the coun-
try’s infrastructure, so the companies saw their growth potential there. 
Besides, prices, due to supply shortages, were quite favorable. So, why 
add additional complexity in the process by doing hot-dip galvanizing and 
increased quality control?
The discussion around diversification, long-term contracts, and stable 
utilization that the automotive industry could bring was, however, suc-
cessful and one supplier was selected for Develop. In a first step, the key 
resources on both sides were identified. A team was formed under the

leadership of an employee who worked in former times for an EPC, or 
engineering procurement construction (a company that builds big plants), 
and afterward for a Western European steel producer, and finally settled 
with the Chinese supplier. Capable employees were nominated for the 
project team from the supplier’s side. The OEM dedicated staff from engi-
neering, the key expert from the stamping department of manufactur-
ing, and quality-control people. In addition to its own people, the OEM 
also mobilized some experts from the current supplier in Europe. These 
experts, who came with expertise in the different steps in production, 
such as pig-iron production, steel milling, continuous casting, and hot- and 
cold-rolling mills, as well as hot-dip galvanizing were integrated. This was 
possible as there were no strategic plans to enter the Chinese market or 
vice-versa.
A project time plan was set up and executed diligently. Testing facilities 
and resources were made available by the OEM. After two challenging 
years, the first coil was delivered that was used in series production. This 
was a significant breakthrough for both the supplier and the OEM. Having 
an exclusivity agreement for a certain period of time brought significant 
advantage to the OEM and a solid utilization to the supplier. The invest-
ment of the OEM paid off!
Implementation Challenges at Heartland
In order to advance the implementation of SRM at Heartland, 
Thomas had increased the frequency of meeting Laura to weekly 
one-on-ones. Laura started the meeting by putting a folded page 
of the Financial Times in front of Thomas. On the page, one 
paragraph was bracketed.
“I read an article on the plane yesterday. It is about how 
carmakers deploy supplier development functions and how 
Japanese carmakers are leading in this sector. I was wondering 
if this is what we need here at Heartland to bring the Develop 
supplier interaction model to life.”
Laura knew that deep down, Thomas was still an automotive guy 
and that he would share his experiences from his time working 
at Autowerke with passion. She would not be disappointed.
“Interesting that you are showing me this article,” Thomas 
commented. “I was involved in upgrading Autowerke’s supplier 
development function early in my tenure there myself. As a 
matter of fact, I spent two months in Japan learning from the 
practices of Japanese carmakers.”

“What is so special about the way they do it?” Laura asked.
“Carmakers in America and in Europe have always had some 
kind of supplier development function, but it has largely 
been limited to certifying new suppliers, auditing quality, and 
identifying savings potential in production. Japanese carmakers 
have followed a higher-touch approach. They would have more 
and better-qualified people on the ground and actually help the 
suppliers with implementation teams and resident engineers. 
While Europeans and Americans saw supplier development 
mostly as programs to enforce price reductions, the Japanese saw 
it as an investment in the future in order to get more innovation. 
And this clearly paid off. There are many surveys that demonstrate 
the extent to which suppliers prefer Japanese carmakers over 
their European and American competitors. They clearly achieved 
a competitive advantage through improved quality and shorter 
time to market with better product technology.”
Laura was taking notes while Thomas was speaking, “And what 
did you do in Japan?” she asked.
“Well, I believe that Autowerke was the first Western carmaker 
to fully understand the advantage the Japanese OEMs were 
getting out of supplier development. We entered a partnership 
program with the biggest Japanese carmaker in which we 
essentially traded our experience in diesel engine technology for 
their experience in supplier development. I was then part of a 
fairly large group of Autowerke people who spent time working 
in their supplier development function. If I remember correctly, 
we had four different teams there. One was focusing on supplier 
assessment, the second on interventions—meaning when 
something goes wrong at a supplier and you have to fix it—the 
third team was focusing on proactive supplier development, and 
the fourth one on monitoring and control. I was part of the third 
team, for which my subgroup focused on the Japanese way of 
ensuring global-production readiness at suppliers. We called it 
cannon launch.”
“And how did you incorporate this at Autowerke?”
“Oh, this was a fairly long process—it took at least two years, 
I think. We started with reactive measures in order to better 
respond to issues our suppliers were having. Once suppliers had 
gained confidence in our ability to help them out, we gradually 
moved toward more proactive measures to help them improve 
their performance. Suppliers actually had to pay for our services. 
Initially, 75 percent of the cost was funded by Autowerke, but 
www.it-ebooks.info

79
over time we switched to 100 percent supplier funding. This was 
actually very successful and our function grew to well over 200 
supplier development people.”
Laura appeared to be discouraged by this. “Wow, there is so 
much to do in parallel. How can we get anywhere close to where 
Autowerke is on this? We can’t seriously start sending people to 
Japan . . . .”
“You don’t need to, Laura. We can hire a couple of folks from 
Autowerke to be the nucleus of our own supplier development 
function. I know most of the key people there and I am sure that 
I can have a good team on board within a month or so.”
Characteristics of Bail Out Suppliers
In addition to Integrate, Bail Out has the lowest number of suppliers in 
the SRM framework—but these suppliers are really handpicked. For a 
company with 1,000 suppliers, we would expect to find less than a handful 
of suppliers in this interaction model.
Generally speaking, suppliers in Bail Out (Figure 6-3) are highly interesting 
and promising. Their strategic potential is outstanding and much higher 
than that of the vast majority of suppliers working with the company. The 
products and services these suppliers provide are innovative and can be a 
differentiation factor for the company’s position in the market.

Nevertheless, their performance is poor. This could be based on an 
­egregious error or a chronic problem that suddenly requires triage. Such 
situations can significantly jeopardize business by threatening supply or 
even the launch of a new product.
The immediate goal is to stabilize the supplier’s performance. The long-
term goal is to learn from the problem to avoid future bailouts with this 
supplier. It may seem counterintuitive, but this is a relationship that needs 
to be maintained, particularly with important suppliers. The Bail Out rela-
tionship should be brief, rare, and regarded as temporary step toward 
improving the overall supplier relationship.
Usually, the help is provided by you without considering what you will 
receive in return. Supply is threatened and you step in to correct matters. 
Ensuring ongoing supply is generally seen as a sufficient short-term payoff. 
There is not time to discuss how the help will be funded other than a 
quick consideration of available contractual damages.
However, “resorting to contract” immediately, when there is any form of 
issue with performance, does not fix the problem and is not usually an 
effective remedy. It also kills the relationship, and, remember that the sup-
plier has outstanding strategic potential. Killing the relationship would not 
be a good long-term outcome. If there is time, instead think about more 
creative long-term payoffs the supplier can make in return for the help, 
such as exclusivity on certain products or even a part ownership share 
in the company. In the heat of the moment, it is difficult to think of the 
long-term relationship. But demonstrating your longer-term commitment 
will have a strong payoff.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
The desired behavior of the Bail Out supplier is to acknowledge the sever-
ity of the situation and allow your company to intervene. To do this, the 
supplier needs to see the benefit it will get if it complies with the actions 
of the Bail Out plan.
The major investments the company makes in Bail Out suppliers will make 
it obvious that you have a special interest in stabilizing and strengthening 
the relationship. This can be communicated in a way that the supplier sees 
that correcting the situation will be a joint effort and also a joint benefit 
in the end.
This also means that the supplier should not only comply with the instruc-
tions given by the company and its potential external experts but also 
come up with meaningful solutions to fix shortcomings.

Note
■
■
  To sum up, a high ambition and motivation level of the supplier and the company, 
trust, and beneficial collaboration are the ingredients of success in the Bail Out interaction 
model.
How to Work with Bail Out Suppliers
Bailouts are expensive for everyone and time is king. This means that it 
is key to recognize the bailout situation immediately in order to reduce 
damage and to help save the relationship. It is necessary to have an open 
relationship with the supplier.
As there are very specific challenges that have to be resolved in bailouts, 
it is obvious that not everything can be fixed by the in-house experts of 
the company. Leading companies therefore have arrangements in place 
with external experts who support them in fixing problems based on 
their unique experience. Furthermore, using external experts will avoid 
bottlenecks in the company.
The company’s office is not the best location for managing bailouts. Usually, 
the supplier’s premises are the right place. This allows access to all stake-
holders, access to production, and access to real-time updates. It is thus 
better to have boots on the ground sooner than later.
Companies often lose sight of the fact that a Bail Out supplier has high 
strategic potential. As a result of this, they make a major error. Once the 
original problem has been fixed, they sometimes feel let down by the 
supplier. As a result, they quickly jump to replace the supplier with a dif-
ferent one. This is not the right outcome. If the supplier really has high 
strategic potential, then the right answer is to carry on nurturing it to 
enable it to progress and achieve the full potential you can get from the 
relationship. The company’s ambition for a Bail Out supplier ought to be 
for it to achieve its potential and ultimately be in the Critical Cluster, not 
be replaced.
Governance 
The governance needs to recognize three key requirements: First, sup-
pliers usually drop into Bail Out as a result of a failure. Predicting and 
preventing failures in advance is a crucial governance need. Second, once 
a supplier drops into Bail Out, the appropriate task force needs to be in 
place with the right governance to ensure that the issues are addressed. 
Third, once the issues that led to the bailout have been stabilized, then the 
right governance needs to be in place to prevent recurrence.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
82
In terms of the first point, in order to recognize Bail Out situations quickly 
and early, there needs to be an early warning mechanism in place. The 
­difficulty for problems with new products and new technology is that early 
warning mechanisms are hard to determine. One can, for example, study 
the trends of performance data and carry out supplier audits. Governance 
needs to be in place to ensure that the results of such work are reviewed 
across the supply base. If issues are flagged, then the appropriate guidance 
needs to be given to the supplier before the bailout is triggered. However, 
no such technique is foolproof and some bailouts will always elude the 
early warning system.
The second issue involves ensuring that the right governance is in place 
to ensure that cross-functional and external support can be deployed 
once a bailout is indicated. This will need to be done urgently—an impor-
tant, innovative supplier with high strategic value needs help. A task force 
consisting of representatives of the supplier, the company, and external 
experts needs to be created. Both the supplier and the company need to 
dedicate resources. This task force drives the performance improvement 
in a project type of setting. A kind of war room setup enables the joint 
team to execute the project and to make the improvements transparent. 
A joint steering committee will need to be in place to govern the work 
of the task force and provide an escalation point. It is also crucial to avoid 
encumbering the task force with commercial or contractual topics. Allow 
the task force to fix things. Deal with any commercial concerns separately 
and at a steering committee level.
In the third requirement, once the situation is stabilized, the task force 
can be unwound and the governance revert to a more business-as-usual 
approach, with the supplier being able to manage its own affairs without 
detailed day-to-day intervention on your part. There is a balance to strike 
here between the risks of unwinding the task force too quickly vs. the 
more desirable choice to revert to the normal state of affairs. Agree 
on a joint plan for reverting to normal. Review progress. Take a gradual 
approach and be prepared to step in again as you slowly wind down the 
task force. As you do this, make sure that you put in place the right gov-
ernance measures that will help to prevent recurrence of the issues that 
gave rise to the bailout in the first place. Assess the risks of recurrence. 
Be prepared to put in place more detailed ongoing oversight than may be 
your norm. But, be careful too. The supplier needs to stand on its own 
two feet. Do not over compensate for past failings. Base your approach on 
a true view of the real, not perceived, risks. Managed well, the supplier will 
be on track to continue as a valued member of your supply base.

Case Example
Most people relate battle tanks to war and many things that are not really 
nice. We should not overlook the fact that battle tanks are also used for 
peacekeeping and for the self-defense of countries. We are going to come 
back to this point.
Despite all the bad feelings that come along with speaking about tanks, 
we have to admit that they are fascinating from an engineering point of 
view. Depending on the type, these vehicles have a double-digit tonnage, 
are able to drive over 100 kilometers per hour, can swim, can crawl after 
swimming in muddy shores, and can climb mountains with inclines of up 
to 70 degrees. These are indeed quite-impressive specifications.
Nevertheless, the core pieces of a battle tank are engine, steel, electronics, 
and protection systems. While the first three categories are supplied by 
big players like Cummins, MTU, SSAB, and others, the protection systems 
could be supplied by quite an innovative player.
A very successful company in the land-defense sector got a new ­contract 
from the Ministry of Defense from a specific country. While the com-
pany had a proven protection system from a well-established supplier, 
R & D was working to gain a competitive advantage by enabling a new 
protection system for the tank. R & D was working very intensively, in 
particular with one supplier that had a completely new technology. Tests 
were performed in top-secret locations, and waste was eliminated so that 
nobody could have any hints of this new technology. Neither sales, nor 
engineering, nor production had any doubts that this new technology was 
leading the market. No other supplier than this one could bring the same 
reduced weight to the protection system by increasing the degree of pro-
tection. Impressions on the overall setup of the supplier were also good. 
The client, a national Ministry of Defense, was also confident in this new 
technology and the client’s engineers were excited about it. This new 
technology was also one of the winning factors for the overall contract, a 
clear strategic advantage for the company.
After the preparation phase, production started and suppliers made their 
first deliveries. Beside the normal challenges in a project-based business in 
this sector, the new and highly praised protection system brought severe 
problems. The quality was not consistent, the deliveries were delayed, and 
the operational performance overall was a disaster.
The company had some experience with low-performing suppliers and 
reacted in the right way. A task force was established and sent immedi-
ately to the supplier. It was not an easy step given the fact that the big 
contract had to be managed, but with the necessity and also the strategic 
advantage, the management freed up resources. Already, after the first 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
84
poor-quality deliveries, they had their feet on the ground and worked 
together with the supplier, which fully realized that these operational 
issues could wipe it out of the market.
The task force supported the supplier to bring the new innovative tech-
nology to a consistent quality level and enabled the supplier to manage its 
operations professionally. This company’s relationship with the supplier 
got very tense over the period of the bailout. Nowadays, the company is 
highly profitable, and, after a period of exclusivity, opened the market to 
others, too. A nice unexpected outcome: this supplier always offers its 
innovations first to the company that helped it in fixing its problem—a 
continuous strategic advantage.
Heartland: Calbury Races Ahead
Thomas was in a rueful mood. Laura sat down. He opened up 
his iPad and handed it to her and asked her to look at the screen. 
“Calbury sure is doing well with that ‘Taste Fresh Longer’ 
packaging that it sources from Marshfield. See this announcement 
here of the extra sales that the company is driving from it? Well, 
the company’s not just making extra sales on the product but 
both companies are also making really nice margins.”
“I saw that earlier as well,” said Laura. “The joint venture that 
Marshfield and Calbury set up has a patent on it, as you know. 
They are really not interested in making it available to anyone 
else.”
“I heard talk that they might be making it available soon,” 
Thomas offered.
“So far, it is just rumors,” Laura speculated. “I think what they 
will do is make a less-sophisticated version of the packaging 
available more widely. They are worried about competition 
concerns, and Marshfield does have an interest in driving 
more volume than they get purely from Calbury. But the most 
sophisticated formulation of the packaging will remain exclusive 
to Calbury we hear—at least for the foreseeable future.”
“Right now, our response is to work with another company 
to develop an alternative that does not infringe the patent,” 
suggested Thomas. “That will take time and be expensive. Or 
we just hope that Marshfield’s competitors will do something 
anyway. In the meantime, our retail customers are keener to 
push Calbury brands in what is one of our prime categories. Not 
a great place to be in.”

“You know,” said Laura, “things could have been very 
different.”
“How?” asked Thomas. “Marshfield has been quite a peripheral 
supplier to us for quite a while. We have only kept buying the 
product that we needed for logistical reasons, really. But the 
company has been one of Calbury’s major suppliers for a long 
time. Calbury did a lot to build the relationship and ecosystem that 
we are now seeing in place. Our failure has not been not doing the 
same thing with someone else.”
“You know it was not always like that though, Thomas. A few 
years before you joined from Autowerke as CPO, the company 
was actually seen as a key supplier. I remember that it supplied 
our Italian plant. It was really significant.”
“I did not know that. What happened?”
“We had the great ‘ripping of film’ drama about five years 
ago.”
“I did hear someone refer to that,” said Thomas. “What has that 
got to do with it?”
“Well, Marshfield was our biggest film supplier. You know how 
production people are with film. A lot of the specifications are 
custom-made and take practice. Accordingly, they are hard to 
codify. The production people hate changes, even if they might 
be beneficial.”
“Right, tell me about it,” said Thomas.
“OK, so Marshfield came to us with a great idea to make the film 
stronger and even more lustrous to the touch while still being 
thin. It would make the product look better. It was an interesting 
innovation, but our production people were reluctant to do it. 
It would be slightly cheaper, but that was not a real reason to 
do it and Procurement had no real power at that time anyway. 
However, the fact that it made the product look better meant that 
it got support from Marketing. So, it was agreed to do a trial on 
the new film in one of our plants—the one in Ulm.”
“That was a brave thing to do, then,” said Thomas.
“At the time, it came to be seen as something quite beyond 
‘brave.’ It was set up as a pilot, but Marshfield had all sorts 
of problems with the new film. First, it started to break in our 
machines, even though it was supposed to be stronger. That 
was, in reality, partly our fault due to how we were running the 
machines. Then, Marshfield had problems making enough of it 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 | “Problem Children”
86
in the right quality and consistency. We did not have a supplier 
development team back then, but we did put some production 
engineers in there to help sort out the problems. It was a bit like 
closing the door after the horse had bolted.”
“I see,” said Thomas. “So, it was a bit of a panic?”
“Oh yes. Many people bore the scars. We got it fixed in the end 
and no actual product was affected by the problems. Also, the 
production schedule was not really hit because we had inventory 
anyway. We always had lots of inventory of film in those days, 
whether we needed it or not.”
“What lessons were learned?” asked Thomas.
Laura laughed. “Not the lessons we should have learned. What 
we should have learned is that for a product change like that to 
be successful and for real innovation to take place, you need to 
carry out joint planning up-front and collaborate. We did not do 
that. We just went into crisis mode at the first sign of trouble.”
“What else happened?”
“That is the real tragedy. We blamed the supplier for all the 
problems. In reality, the fault was on both sides. And, the 
company was genuinely trying to give us first access to an 
interesting innovation! For all of its pains, it ended being tagged 
as an unreliable supplier. We started to move business away 
from the company. Everyone started to see awarding business 
to Marshfield as career limiting. So, it became less important. 
It works both ways, of course. We became less important to the 
company and it built their relationship with Calbury. Nobody 
stopped to think that perhaps Marshfield had something 
genuinely different to offer us. They just focused on the ripping-
of-film drama.”
“And the rest is history,” said Thomas. “Calbury reaps the 
benefits of our shortsightedness.”
“It gets more tragic though, would you believe?” said Laura.
“How can it get more tragic than that?” inquired Thomas. He 
leaned forward to concentrate. This was really was turning into 
quite a revelatory discussion.
“Well,” said Laura, “there are rumors in the marketplace. People 
are saying that the know-how that Marshfield gleaned to create 
the Taste Fresh Longer line came as a direct result of the ripping-
of-film debacle.”

“What? Seriously?!” commented Thomas, surprised.
“Yes. They learned a lot about the chemical properties of how 
to make different types of film from the incident. Also, our 
troubleshooting with them at an operational level was highly 
successful. They learned the additional lesson that collaboration 
with key customers on product innovation can be beneficial. 
According to our own rumor mill, they did try to do that with us. 
But, of course, we were not listening and they had written us off. 
They turned instead to working with Calbury. Although it took a 
few years, this led directly to the innovation that is now causing 
us so much irritation.”
Thomas took his iPad back from Laura. “We really need to avoid 
similar debacles like this in the future. Let’s learn the lessons.”
Problematics: Handle with Care
In this chapter, we have described the three interaction models that make 
up the Problematics, or problem children. As we have seen, these suppli-
ers should constitute far fewer than 10 percent of your total supply base. 
This is just as well because in all cases performance is poor and serious 
fixes are needed. Where strategic potential is low, you should not incur 
effort to make the fix but replace the supplier after giving it sufficient 
opportunity to improve. In other cases, where strategic potential is higher, 
you should incur effort to nurture the supplier toward greater things.
We will turn our attention in Chapter 7 to address the suppliers that are 
already capable of these greater things. These are the suppliers in the 
Critical Cluster—the very small number of suppliers from which you can 
access true innovation and the ones to which you really want to devote 
the majority of your attention.
www.it-ebooks.info

The “Critical 
Cluster”
Driving Behavior to Get Results
Our tour of the different clusters is completed with the “Critical Cluster.” 
We finish here because this is the area where the most important suppli-
ers will be located. These are suppliers that can contribute to competitive 
advantage and where the relationship needs special nurturing. It is from 
these suppliers that you will get the most innovation and risk mitigation.
The secret sauce to making this relationship model work is to establish 
trust with these suppliers. Failure to create the necessary level of trust 
is probably the number one reason so few companies create such deep 
relationships with these suppliers. Free markets and competition encour-
age companies to be secretive and protect their competitive advantage 
while it lasts. Many are afraid they will lose it if they get too comfortable 
with their suppliers, which in many cases also cater to the company’s big-
gest competitors. But establishing deep trust can work, and we are strong 
believers that every company that wants to can reap the benefits of a 
close relationship with the right suppliers.
Think of one of the world’s most secretive consumer-electronics companies, 
notorious for keeping its newest products secret even to most of its own 
employees. Yet part of its secret sauce is working very closely with key 
partners that help develop, test, and manufacture most of its products. The 
relationship is built on strong mutual dependence and deep trust going 
beyond cultural barriers, which has vaulted both companies to the top 
levels in their industry.

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”

Most companies won’t have that level of trust with suppliers when start-
ing with SRM. The way forward is to focus on the fundamentals of the 
interaction model first, and then develop trust through time as the rela-
tionship deepens and evolves. Using the concrete actions of collaboration 
as stepping stones serves to build that trust. Lastly, being transparent with 
the supplier in applying the interaction model is a way to engender trust 
with it.
Let’s look at each of the three types of suppliers in the Critical Cluster 
in depth.
Characteristics of Influence Suppliers
Very few suppliers will fit the Influence model (Figure 7-1). To do so, they 
would have to perform very well in all regards. You could say that those 
in this model deliver nearly perfect products or services. What sets them 
apart is that they offer the potential for innovation when you work with 
them jointly to develop new products or services. This factor shapes your 
relationship with them.

Figure 7-1.  Influence suppliers on the strategy/performance axes
Compared to Integrate suppliers, companies cannot build lasting competi-
tive advantage with Influence suppliers. This is because they do not offer 
the full long-term and all-embracing partnership that is required to steal 
a march on your competitors over the long term. These suppliers often 
dominate an industry, as they are among the critical few that a company 
and its competitors rely on. They supply key technologies or services that 
www.it-ebooks.info

91
Supplier Relationship Management
define the industry’s standard and their share of wallet is likely to be very 
high. To provide such a high level of innovation, they often invest heavily in 
development or capital equipment cost. As a result, they will often favor 
scale over exclusivity in order to amortize the up-front investments. In 
turn, they do not favor any one customer, and, in the case of monopolistic 
suppliers, are required by law not to do so. At times, you may be able to 
achieve limited exclusivity on specific innovations as a launch customer 
in return for assisting with the upfront development. However, over time, 
the Influence supplier will certainly seek to make the innovation available 
more widely. This is a reality that you need to recognize.
So, you get cutting-edge service and innovative products. The downside, 
of course, is that it is nearly impossible to outpace your competition for-
ever when you work with these suppliers. What’s more, mismanage this 
relationship, and you could alienate these suppliers enough that you fall 
behind the competitors that are better at handling their relationship with 
the same supplier.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
The preferred behavior from an Influence supplier is to be able to affect 
its innovation roadmaps and be the first to the market with new technol-
ogy. You will, at least, want to get some level of preferential treatment as 
well. The essential ingredient to the relationship is building trust and an 
incentive structure that will motivate the supplier to open up. The sup-
plier has to see the type of competencies you bring to the table and the 
benefit in working with you in particular. You need to put yourself in its 
shoes to truly understand what drives it. As a highly innovative technology 
company, it may seek a company with a strong sales channel to quickly 
position its products and drive fast growth. Or it may be after specific 
market segments in which it is not yet established or that it sees as being 
of strategic importance. Then again, it may just need a sufficient initial 
order to jump over the internal hurdle to get the final “go” to develop a 
new product or service.
An Influence supplier may aspire to become an Integrate supplier with 
your organization, but that will only happen in very few selected cases, as 
it would mean deprioritizing or even ignoring other customers. This may 
happen in the case of a nascent technological innovation that presents 
a high, risky bet and where a powerful ecosystem of specific customers 
and buyers provides the right mix of competencies to make it work. The 
company is hoping to get as much out of the relationship as you are. 
Once the technology becomes more mature, the relationship might drift 
back to Influence, but this may take several years or product and service 
generations to come.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”
92
On the other hand, the supplier may fall short in terms of future inno-
vations and—even while maintaining the same flawless performance  
levels—might move back to being a Harvest supplier. This will happen, for 
instance, when there is a jump in the technology curve and the supplier 
has missed the innovation window either as leader or follower.
How to Work with Influence Suppliers
As with most relationships in life, good timing and regular communication 
are critical for capitalizing on opportunities with Influence suppliers. You 
want to set the expectation up-front that it is necessary to have access to 
their product, technology, process, and innovation roadmaps. Evaluate the 
supplier for opportunities that you can tap into or even areas that could 
provide limited exclusivity. Request ongoing feedback on how your com-
pany’s actions and plans dovetail with its own for mutual advantage, and 
then negotiate competitive pricing accordingly. And don’t be shy and stop 
here; rather, go further to also align on strategy and dedicate resources to 
generate a sustained competitive advantage.
Influence relationships can consume a substantial amount of resources, 
so you need to make the investment pay off by encouraging confidence 
in each other’s plans. In case of interesting new product technologies, you 
might want to become a launch customer to gain first-mover advantage 
and to get preferential treatment over the lifetime of the product.
Note
■
■
  Influence relationships can be time-consuming, so make the investment pay off. Ask 
to become a launch customer for an innovation, for example. That can give you that coveted 
“first mover” advantage, as well as goodwill you can capitalize upon later.
As a launch customer, you will be first to recognize the potential future 
strategic value of the new product or service, and must often be willing to 
write a check several months if not years in advance before actually seeing 
the result. But keep in mind that Influence suppliers are not just looking 
for resources—if that were the only thing they were interested in, they 
could go elsewhere. They are mostly looking for a sales channel to find 
first users of their innovation right after the product launch. Becoming 
a launch customer enables exactly that: It provides a convincing sales 
channel and commitment to buy sufficient ramp-up volume. In return, 
the supplier will get preferential treatment and even a say in the prod-
uct- or service-development process. This can be valuable; the company 
may suggest certain features that would otherwise not have been consid-
ered by your development team. In many cases, there will be an exclusive

­relationship for a certain amount of time after the product launch. It may 
not last long, though. To drive improvements and stay competitive in the 
market, the supplier will go after scale and start offering the same product 
or service to other customers. As a launch customer, you may neverthe-
less still receive special treatment in terms of higher price discounts, better 
product or service support, and committer capacity, something that can 
be especially critical in times of supply disruptions.
Governance
These relationships are based on mutual trust, so you want to make 
sure the supplier understands the importance of the relationship to you. 
Nominate a sponsor for the relationship on both sides, someone with suf-
ficient political weight to drive the alignment of priorities for new product 
or service development. Mutual teams could be built to drive develop-
ment of future products. The supplier may even send dedicated people to 
join your development teams and allow for real-time feedback loops.
Typically, you should expect a series of regular formal executive reviews, at 
least quarterly, that focus on identifying future opportunities and review-
ing progress in collaborative innovation efforts. In addition, plan to hold a 
series of informal meetings to strengthen the relationship at all levels and 
across different stakeholder groups.
Case Example #1
Let’s look at an example for Influence from the commercial aircraft indus-
try, which is an extremely complex industry. It has high barriers to entry 
and it is capital intensive, with companies realizing profits only after a long 
time. With only a few manufacturers of aircraft—even just two in the 
long-distance aircraft market—the airlines will never be able to get exclu-
sive deals from any of them. So there is a strong incentive on the airline 
side to gain access to new aircraft development as soon as possible and 
get the starting advantage over other airlines.
In the late 1980s, the aircraft maker Airbus started to think of develop-
ing a new ultra high-capacity airliner to break the dominance of Boeing’s 
747 as the only true high-capacity, long-distance aircraft. Developing new 
technologies and designing aircraft is a long-term process with significant 
financial risk; the development costs of designing a new airplane are in 
the billions. Singapore Airlines recognized the opportunity by building a 
strong relationship with Airbus. Both sides had high win-win expectations 
for their cooperation. The airline wanted first-mover advantage as the 
launch customer, but it had a primary interest in influencing the develop-
ment process, specifically the design of the passenger cabin. The aircraft

producer was given security through a committed initial order from one 
of the leading global airlines with a convincing marketing arm that would 
quickly bring other customers on board.
Singapore Airlines capitalized on the possibility of influencing the design 
process of the cabin by redefining the flying experience. The new first class 
is not even called that anymore—the company describes it as “beyond 
first class.” The luxurious suites are targeted at passengers who do not 
want to compromise on either sleeping or the seating and working expe-
rience while in air. Each “suite” has a full-size mattress, sliding doors, and 
pull-down windows. It more resembles an old, classy train cabin than an 
airplane seat, and it sets a new standard for luxury in commercial aircraft. 
The flight attendants actually walk between walls, not seats. If you want to 
work on your computer, you can connect it to the large screen hanging 
on the wall of the suite. If you want to dine with another passenger, you 
can do that as well. There is even a suite with a double bed that the airline 
coined as “honeymooners’ suite.” This clearly propelled the airline to the 
top as the trendsetter for luxury air travel. The airline also cares for its 
staff and has further improved the area flight attendants work in. Several 
additional comfort features have been implemented for both pilots and 
the crew.
Singapore Airlines had great success as the launch customer for the new 
jumbo jet. It significantly expanded its brand value, customer base, and  
new services. In less than one-and-a-half years, the one-millionth passenger  
flew with Singapore Airlines on the new A380 aircraft. A big marketing  
effort, followed by extensive media coverage, turned the airline into the  
best-known airline carrier. Especially successful was a charity auction on 
eBay, in which passengers bought seats paying between $560 and $100,380 
for the first-scheduled flight of the aircraft. That turned into a huge marketing  
success. To commemorate the inaugural flight, passengers received a  
personalized certificate showing they were part of the first historic flight. 
The airline also profited from the early stage of cooperation by being able to  
develop a new customer experience with the newly defined business-suite  
class influencing the aircraft’s interior design.
Airbus’s advantages from the early-stage cooperation turned into a big 
success as well, as they not only heard the voice of the customer through 
the entire product development process but also profited from free media 
coverage. And even more important, the buying commitment from one of 
the largest and most admired airlines positively influenced buying deci-
sions from other airlines.

Case Example #2
The same kind of close working relationship paid off for the transporta-
tion authority of London, a city which already had a highly modern fleet 
of off-the-shelf buses in operation. In this case, it wanted a new bus that 
was especially tailored to London’s operating conditions. It also wanted 
the new bus to become as iconic on the city’s streets as the classic open-
platform Routemaster design of the 1950s had been. In short, London 
desired a bus that would be an emblem for the city. In 2010, it chose the 
outline design via a public competition and selected Wrightbus for the 
manufacture and detailed design. The detailed styling was then produced 
through close collaboration with Heatherwick Studio.
The suppliers created a unique vehicle that meets the specific needs of 
London’s ridership with full wheelchair and pram accessibility, a hybrid 
electric- and diesel-power engine, and an aluminum frame, making it one 
of the most environmentally friendly buses in the world. The iconic feature 
of a rear open platform enabling hop-on, hop-off operation when a con-
ductor is present was preserved. Building on the success of its namesake 
predecessor, the new Routemaster features asymmetric glass swoops as 
its signature “futuristic” styling feature.
Inspired by the classic Routemaster, the transportation authority and 
bus manufacturer developed the first bus in more than 50 years to be 
designed specifically for London’s streets. This joint supplier relationship 
successfully introduced this cutting-edge vehicle on the city’s streets and 
produced the largest order for hybrid buses in Europe. The transpor-
tation authority has had significant influence on the bus manufacturer’s 
product roadmap and the design of the bus. While the bus is quite specific 
to London, it will be available for the broader customer base interested in 
purchase of double-decker city buses.
Collaboration Pays Off for Heartland
Laura was musing over the missed opportunity that Marshfield 
had represented as she walked into the office at Fort Wayne 
one morning. There was a spring in her step, though. She was 
wondering whether today would represent redemption for 
Heartland Consolidated Industries and a tangible outcome from 
TrueSRM that would really be “something big.” For today was 
the culmination of many months of really focused work between 
a cross-functional Heartland team and Caledonian Packaging, a 
packaging-industry competitor of Marshfield. It was the day that 
both companies would make a formal announcement of a major 
new innovation into the market. The innovation was being made 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”
96
by Caledonian. Heartland was committing resources and funds. 
In return for the resources and funds, Heartland was made the 
launch customer. Analysts, customers, and press representatives 
had been invited. The innovation was expected to have a major 
impact on both Heartland’s and Caledonian’s respective revenue 
and stock prices. The presentation really needed to go well. The 
atmosphere in Fort Wayne was electric. The spring in Laura’s 
step was tinged with trepidation.
The story had started six months before. Caledonian was a long-
term supplier to Heartland. It had reaped much of the benefit 
from the long-term decline in Marshfield serving as a Heartland 
supplier following the great “ripping film” debacle. Yet there 
was a sense that Caledonian had grown a little complacent at 
Heartland. Nobody could remember the last great innovation 
that Caledonian had introduced. It was not clear to anyone, in 
fact, that they “did” innovation at all. However, they were seen 
as safe, their film and other materials worked in Heartland’s 
machines, and no one was likely to get fired for using them. 
Heartland was also not sure that it even needed packaging 
innovation, especially in the post–ripping film era.
As we have seen, this apparent complacency on both sides was 
dramatically shaken by the “Tastes Fresh Longer” innovation. 
Both Heartland and Caledonian were embarrassed. The initial 
reaction was, as might be expected, one of mutual recrimination. 
Both Laura and Thomas had attended a meeting to which they 
had urgently summoned Calum Drummond, the Caledonian 
CEO, and senior members of his team. This had been a very 
difficult meeting. The Heartland executives started out by 
berating the Caledonian people for being complacent and not 
bringing anything to the table. At first, Calum had stayed silent, 
while his colleagues politely listened to Heartland and showed 
contrition.
However, the meeting turned ugly when Heartland’s CFO, 
Garner, intervened and commented, “You know, I really wonder 
whether Caledonian should be one of our suppliers going 
forward.”
Calum was a feisty Scotsman. There was no way he was going 
to tolerate any more one-sided abuse. “A customer gets the 
behavior it deserves,” he contested. “You have wanted safety 
and security for the past three years. Everything you have told 
us has to do with ‘Please make sure there are no more ripping 
film sagas.’ We have done what you asked. You have shown no 
interest in any innovation that we have shown you. You reject

everything that is new. The ‘no more ripping films’ instruction is 
engraved on our hearts. Now, when you are caught out, you have 
the gall to blame us. I am shocked at what I am hearing today. 
Do you want to fix things or just sit here kicking my team?  
I have had enough . . . .”
Calum motioned to leave.
Thomas, who had been silent, raised his hand to speak. “Calum, 
let’s fix things. I hear you. I think we have all got a little 
emotional today. Let’s have a short break to stretch our legs.” 
He summoned Calum and the two of them stepped out of the 
room together and walked toward Thomas’s office.
“Thank you for pushing back, Calum,” said Thomas. “That is 
always hard for a supplier to do. My team were maybe a little out 
of order but you can appreciate the emotion this has aroused.”
“I do,” said Calum.
They entered Thomas’s office. “So tell me,” inquired 
Thomas, “What are these innovations we keep rejecting? I am 
intrigued.”
Calum had a seat. “Well,” he said. “There are many examples. 
But the one we are really proud of is that we came up with an 
idea for a film that changes color. It changes color if the product 
has at any time been kept at the wrong temperature. You know, 
so many foods can spoil and the end customer will just take 
into consideration the final temperature. But, a guarantee of 
the correct temperature right through the supply chain really is 
something else.” Calum was getting quite animated. “We think 
some retailers may not like it but the premium ones will embrace 
it to prove their credentials. Then, the rest will have no choice 
but to follow.”
“When did you talk to us about it?” asked Thomas.
“Oh, a couple of months ago.”
“And you have not gone elsewhere with it yet?” Thomas 
inquired.
“No. Given that Calbury works so much with Marshfield, we 
prefer not to take it there. And, we really feel we need to work 
closely with a customer to perfect it. It’s exciting but a bit untried, 
so ideally we would like to see a launch customer prepared to 
invest in it. We have been hoping that would be Heartland.”

98
“You know, Calum, you and I should meet more,” smiled 
Thomas. “I think that together we might be able to cut through 
some of the red tape on things like this.”
“Music to my ears,” said Calum.
They returned to the conference room. The air had cleared a bit. 
The other team members were talking about the color-changing 
film, too. One of the Heartland people had remembered it from 
the discussion two months before. With a slight steer from 
Thomas and Calum, the meeting moved from a recrimination 
session into “How to compete with Calbury and Marshfield.” 
The plan was borne to co-commercialize the color-changing 
film. Both parties committed resources and investment. They 
also agreed to act rapidly.
Some months later, Laura found herself walking with trepidation 
into the presentation of the formal launch of the color-changing 
film to an awaiting world. She took her seat next to Scarlet, the 
CMO. This event was sufficiently high profile that both Thomas 
and Calum were the key presenters, rather than the functional 
leaders. They needn’t have worried though. The presentation was 
received incredibly well. The news went viral within minutes of 
it being announced.
That evening, Chuck Evans, the CEO of Calbury, was asked for 
a comment by a business reporter as he attended a reception. All 
he was able to muster was, “No comment.” Thomas chuckled 
when he read that in the news the next day. He could not resist 
picking the phone up to talk to Calum. By now, they were on 
very easy speaking terms.
Characteristics of Invest Suppliers
Suppliers that fall into the Invest interaction model (Figure 7-2) provide a 
portfolio of products or services that could become game changing. Their 
strategic potential is very high. They offer great ideas and innovations, 
but then they stumble in some basic areas, such as providing continu-
ous supply or consistent quality. These capability gaps limit the potential 
to achieve truly game-changing moves with them. Ultimately, they could 
reach Integrate status—but their potential for this rests on the relation-
ship you build with them now and the extent to which they respond. 
Typically, exclusivity is not really important but rather the willingness of 
both parties to cooperate and drive capability improvements.

Figure 7-2.  Invest suppliers on the strategy/performance axes
The Invest model can also include investment in development of new 
product or service offerings. It can be investment in new material or pro-
duction technology. In some industries, such as aerospace, it is common 
for customers and suppliers to participate in new projects via risk- and 
revenue-sharing partnerships. Both parties contribute to development 
costs and share the returns. Typically, new programs require a major devel-
opment cost and suppliers have some of the key expertise that is needed 
to support it. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) will expect that 
suppliers commit both expertise and capital to finance the cost. The basic 
principle applied is that suppliers that have to make the most up-front 
investment are entitled to a proportional share of the revenue as the proj-
ect realizes its goals. Revenue will be earned over the period that could 
be as long as 30 years, and profit increases toward the end of the product 
life cycle once both parties start selling spare parts. This illustrates a very 
nontraditional customer-supplier relationship. Both parties invest heavily 
in new product development, and if they fail, they fail together. The sup-
plier has a strong incentive to make the investment. Often this is accom-
panied by additional investment on the OEM side to ensure that suppliers 
deliver the expected performance levels.
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
Ideally, an Invest supplier will aspire to Integrate status and will invest with 
you in building capabilities to achieve this title. It is OK or even desired for 
the supplier to be bullish about its future with you. But, it also needs to be 
able to look into the mirror and recognize the necessity that it improves. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”

Provided this is the case, we recommend nurturing the relationship by 
investing time, money, and resources in developing the supplier’s capabili-
ties to meet your needs. The best candidates will make capability building 
a top priority. Be forewarned, however, that some suppliers may spurn the 
help, believing that you are attempting to make them “captive” and to cut 
them off from wider market opportunities.
Note
■
■
  Some suppliers may not appreciate their “Invest” categorization. They may feel that 
getting into bed with you now cuts off other opportunities down the road. In other words, what 
looks like a golden opportunity to you may not look so enticing from their point of view. You may 
need to make a good argument to attract their cooperation.
The capability building will follow an aggressive improvement plan with a 
clearly defined target set and a roadmap on how to get there. To ensure 
success, the supplier’s leadership has to share this vision and cascade it 
through the organization. The purpose, or “Why?” for the capability build-
ing has to be clear. In order not to get off the path, these changes must 
be pushed with a high sense of urgency. You will also need to apply steady 
pressure. Identify tenacious change agents in the Invest supplier’s organi-
zation that will take the messages and influence the naysayer to remove 
the roadblocks for improvement. As you progress along the path, docu-
ment improvements and provide areas for growth to the supplier so that 
it sees the return on the investment.
How to Work with Invest Suppliers
In some ways, the Invest model can be likened to a wedding engagement. 
You need to strike the right balance between nurturing the supplier, 
engendering trust, and overcoming fears of “capture.”
A transparent business case that both parties buy into will help alleviate 
supplier hesitancy. It should present a compelling return on investment 
for both parties. To make this work, you need to know what the current 
pain points are for your internal stakeholders—not just Procurement, but 
also Engineering, Product Marketing, Quality, and others. And to get your 
investment priorities right, you need to understand the overall impact, 
reviewing with the supplier the timetable to build capabilities in line with 
your expectations. In this model, it is essential that you stick to your com-
mitments in order to reduce the risk to the supplier.
Implementation can be performed by the supplier alone if it has sufficient 
capabilities in-house; if not, you can assist by temporarily assigning your 
own resources or by engaging external help. Often these relationships will 
www.it-ebooks.info

101
Supplier Relationship Management
require you to have boots on the ground, meaning you send your own 
resources to the supplier’s site, be it an engineering group or a factory 
where it makes the products. This simplifies collaboration, especially when 
investing in making something new.
Governance
The Invest interaction model means that both parties have a vested inter-
est in the collaboration. Building a supplier’s competencies is given the 
highest priority and both groups are focused on making the investment 
pay off. Typically, a joint steering committee is established to govern the 
process and track progress. Given the close cooperation, it is important 
that you also clearly define the parties’ respective roles and responsibili-
ties to limit confusion.
Case Example #1
Let’s look at an example from the consumer electronics industry, which 
is known for having all of the production outsourced to contract- 
manufacturing partners. Relationships with suppliers need to be carefully 
managed to be able to deliver products to the market. The industry is 
further characterized by short product life cycles, with many products 
sold for only 12 or 18 months. One of the world’s largest consumer 
electronics companies, Apple, outpaced its competition by focusing on 
technological innovation, design, and corporate leadership. As with many 
other OEMs, Apple sold all of its in-house manufacturing capacity in the 
1990s, and it has relied since then solely on outsourced manufacturers.
Following the huge success of its products, Apple decided to consoli-
date its supply base of contract manufacturers (CM) to allow for better 
control of product cost, lead times, and quality. One particular CM, Hon 
Hai Precision Industry (better known as Foxconn), had the potential to 
become Apple’s single most important contractor due to its flexibility 
in following the company’s guidelines. The resulting success of Foxconn 
in terms of cost-effectiveness and market flexibility depends largely on 
Apple’s strategy of investing heavily in the relationship. In its megafacto-
ries, Foxconn was able to reorganize production lines, and their staffing 
and logistics, in a very short time at the lowest cost. At the same time, 
they followed Apple’s rigorous specifications of price, product quality, and 
time-to-market.
Let’s look more closely at examples of how Apple invested in Foxconn 
to increase its performance. First of all, Apple’s teams of engineers and 
supply chain managers were sent as a task force to Foxconn’s factories 
in an effort to improve production and quality control. The dispatched 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”
102
teams worked together with Foxconn as long as needed to resolve any 
manufacturing and supply chain issues. The way they worked together was 
as one team with clearly defined roles. In addition to investing resources, 
Apple decided to invest billions of dollars in a production line. A look 
into its balance sheets, specifically at the data for machine and equip-
ment expenditure, reveals that there is a consistent pattern of investment 
in equipment and tools installed in its supply base. The technology giant 
has clearly been pursuing a strategic goal to extend control over the 
supply chain. The expenditure has increased to several billion dollars per 
year, and the bulk of the spending is on product tooling and manufac-
turing process equipment. It has been rumored that in one year, Apple 
has invested ten times as much in computer numerical control (CNC) 
machines and tooling installed at Foxconn’s factories than it has in its own 
retail stores. By revolutionizing the use of CNC machining and anodizing 
in the computer electronics industry, the company has been able to offer 
very unique product designs as one of its major market differentiators. 
The advantage is a single-piece unibody design, making the housing seam-
less and beautiful, which is possible because the CNC solution allows the 
number of build parts to be reduced dramatically in the case of a unibody 
notebook chassis. The holes can also be produced to a much tighter toler-
ance than if they were simply molded into the part. The whole assembly 
process is also made easier and the manufacturing becomes closer to full 
automation because CNC machines run in lights-off factories. The latest 
example of an innovation is Apple investing in robots and placing them in 
Foxconn’s megafactories. By investing so much in robotics, the company 
will retain its leadership in manufacturing technology, product quality, and 
worker efficiency for many more years.
Case Example #2
Another example of the Invest interaction model can be found in the auto-
motive industry. As electric cars are becoming mainstream, many compa-
nies and groups of engineers are looking for ways to establish themselves 
in the industry. They are reshaping the mechanics of the automobile, as 
many old paradigms do not hold any more. If we wanted to make a bold 
claim, we could go as far as comparing an electric car to an oversized cell 
phone: in the end, it is primarily a huge battery and the electronics to 
operate it. To design a mainstream electric car, you need a more optimal 
mileage range. Some of the improvements carmakers are pushing include 
improving the weight of the car (the lighter the better to minimize energy 
consumption), improving the aerodynamics of the car, and extending bat-
tery life by providing the ability to recharge while driving and larger and 
lighter batteries.

BMW decided to bet on the use of carbon fibers to significantly reduce the 
weight of the car. Based on initial design estimates, the company expected 
that using carbon fibers would reduce the weight of a small electric car, 
designed for use in the cities, by 500–800 pounds. Today, most cars in gen-
eral are made of steel or aluminum, and carbon frames are half the weight 
of steel and two-thirds the weight of aluminum. With much less weight 
in the car body, BMW decided that it could put a much larger battery 
inside to provide greater mileage. Having very limited experience with the 
material, which was until then used for some high-end sports and racing 
cars, this was a risky bet. What was needed was a supplier with relevant 
experience and a willingness to make the technology affordable for mass 
production. The company reached out to SGL Carbon, one of the world’s 
leading manufacturers of products using carbon fiber. The manufacturer 
recognized the value of the opportunity and decided to participate in an 
investment in a state-of-the-art factory in Moses Lake, Washington, that 
would produce carbon fibers. This location was picked for its cheap and 
readily available clean hydropower from the dams of the Columbia River. 
The production of carbon fibers is the most energy-consuming process in 
the entire value chain, so this had huge cost implications.
The joint partners set up an entire value chain process: the raw materials 
would be imported from a Japanese supplier and the spools of carbon 
fiber from Moses Lake would then be shipped to plants in Germany to be 
woven into fabric and later molded into parts at BMW’s factory. Factories 
were set up to mass-produce the ultra-lightweight body components from 
carbon fiber-reinforced plastics and make the new technology affordable. 
Indeed, this joint venture is expected to set a precedent for the use of 
carbon fiber in mass-produced vehicles, a milestone for the automotive 
industry.
A Challenge for Heartland
Despite the air-conditioning running at full speed, Laura felt 
perspiration building up on her forehead. When Tracey Lin, the 
head of Heartland’s North American Food Division, had asked 
her to support a request for benchmarking procurement with 
EATing, the largest high-end grocery chain, she had assumed 
it would be a walk in the park. Granted, there had been some 
hesitation at the prospect of helping a customer become smarter 
in Procurement, but Thomas had quickly waived concerns with, 
“If we don’t do it, somebody else will. And we have more to 
gain than lose from opening up to them.”
What Laura had not expected, though, was the aggressiveness 
with which the EATing people had approached the benchmarking. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”
104
They had sent a long-and-detailed agenda of what they wanted 
to see and they had proposed breakout groups to discuss certain 
topics more in depth. Then they wanted the breakout groups to 
be coheaded by EATing and Heartland representatives. When it 
turned out that most of the EATing representatives were former 
consultants from top firms, Laura started to have doubts as to 
whether her own people would be an appropriate match. After 
all, her program to upgrade the overall caliber of Procurement 
talent had only just started.
Today, Laura had to face a visit from EATing to discuss the 
benchmarking. Their delegation turned out to be overseen by 
EATing’s head of category management, Spike Turner. That, in 
turn, made the visit a top affair at Heartland. After all, EATing 
was the company’s second-largest retail customer, and Spike 
had never visited Heartland before. Even Tracey had second 
thoughts.
She had said to Laura, “I hope this is not about them assessing 
the effectiveness of our procurement. The last thing we want 
is for them to impose an improvement program on us and then 
squeeze us for the benefits.” After all, EATing had a reputation 
for being exceptionally ruthless with suppliers.
The meeting with EATing turned out to be even more challenging 
than expected. Laura’s presentation on Heartland Procurement 
best practices clearly had failed to impress despite her best efforts. 
Her war stories about introducing cost regression analysis to 
Heartland had been interrupted by Spike saying: “If I remember 
correctly, we introduced statistical tools to category management 
back in the early ’90s. There was a golden opportunity when the 
stock market was down and we could snap up some analysts 
from Wall Street for cheap. Retail is a cutthroat business with 
razor-thin margins, you know. Obviously, Heartland is far more 
comfortable than we are.” It took a couple of seconds for Laura 
to compose herself after this. She knew how to deal with high-
ranking supplier executives and board members, but this was 
different. If this meeting went sour, a lot of revenue would be 
at stake.
“Spike, I sense that you are not getting what you are looking for 
out of this meeting. Please help me to better understand, what 
would make you deem the trip to Fort Wayne worthwhile?”
Before Tracey could say anything, the executive responded: 
“OK, let me be frank with you. We have run out of ideas on what 
to do on the procurement end of category management. We know 
www.it-ebooks.info

105
Supplier Relationship Management
for sure that we at EATing are better than all our competitors, yet 
our margins are still disappointing. So we have turned to our 
three biggest suppliers for inspiration. You are actually the last 
one we are talking to. We have drawn blanks in the first two 
meetings and quite frankly, this looks like another one. Don’t 
get me wrong, what you are doing here is all very good and 
admirable and so on, but there is nothing exceptional, nothing 
we can transfer to EATing. So for the sake of your time and our 
time, it might be best to wrap up.”
Without hesitating for a second, Laura knew what to do. “Well, 
there is one more thing that I have not talked about. It is brand 
new and we have not fully gotten our heads around it. We call it 
TrueSRM.” She then went on to explain the story of the voyage 
of discovery that Heartland had embarked on, including some of 
the key successes like the collaboration with Caledonian. The 
EATing delegation asked lots of questions and the discussion 
quickly veered away from the presentation slides in a highly 
positive way. The discussion extended way beyond the agreed 
time.
It was not obvious at the time, but ultimately, that day—and 
specifically that discussion of TrueSRM—would come to be 
marked in the annals of Heartland as the day that transformed the 
relationship with EATing. Given his experience and knowledge, 
Spike immediately understood the value of TrueSRM. What 
then followed the meeting was first a very personal thank you 
note from Spike to Laura, copying Thomas and Tracey. Then, 
Spike insisted on having Laura being present in all the meetings 
he would have with Tracey and every time they met different 
aspects of SRM were discussed. Finally, Spike reached out to 
Thomas with what he called a grand bargain. EATing wanted 
to launch a new comprehensive line of organic food. It believed 
that Heartland, despite not having the strongest credentials in 
that segment, would have the muscle to pull this off in a way that 
would leave little room for competitors. To Laura’s delight, the 
program would be code-named “Invest.”
Characteristics of Integrate Suppliers
Together with Bail Out, Integrate has the lowest number of suppliers in 
the SRM framework—but these suppliers are really handpicked. For a 
company with 1,000 suppliers, we would expect to find a handful of sup-
pliers in this interaction model. Some companies may not even have one 
of them, as this model requires highly specific interaction.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”
106
In the Integrate model (Figure 7-3), the goals of the two organizations 
are genuinely integrated, and they work together as equal partners. This 
is what distinguishes Integrate. In both the Influence and Invest models, 
there is strong collaboration, but the supplier and customer are not quite 
equals. They do not function as one entity and the relationship is not so 
all-embracing either. Colloquially, Integrate is a partnership with a capital 
“P.” Although an often-overused term in business, the true partnership is 
rare, being based on a multiyear, differentiated, and comprehensive rela-
tionship between you and your supplier to build an ecosystem that shapes 
the market. The supplier chosen for this model should be in your sweet 
spot: Its performance is flawless, and it holds the key to making you a 
formidable competitor by creating opportunities to grow revenues and 
profits while jointly shaping or reshaping the industry. You and the supplier 
will act very much like a single entity.

It is, then, a very closely integrated relationship you build with suppliers, 
like a virtually integrated enterprise. Indeed, it is sometimes likened to 
a marriage in that it is a long-term, highly integrated relationship. In this 
integration, you would create a winning ecosystem to jointly shape the 
market.
To build and maintain such an involved relationship as the Integrate model 
requires substantial investment by both parties. Understand that the 
­supplier that commits to this model takes on significant risk. By giving you 
highly preferential treatment, it could be limiting its own growth potential. 
Likewise, such concentrated, powerful Integrate relationships suggest that 
you should have no more than a handful of these suppliers on board.

Supplier Relationship Management
What Kind of Behavior to Drive
There is only one right way to treat your Integrate supplier, and that is the  
same way you would treat your own factory. You pay it the highest respect, 
as it is key to making you successful. The preferred behavior of the supplier 
is to see the relationship as one ecosystem, or as an extension of its own 
company. Depending on each party’s capabilities, you want to define the 
roles to capitalize on strengths. The supplier should be involved in making 
product decisions, for example deciding which market segments to attack, 
determining the right product or service to offer and its target cost, how 
to design and manufacture the product or deliver the service, and so on. 
It needs to think of you not only as its most desired customer, but even 
more as a partner in crime. If a product or service fails, you will both pay 
the price for it. Your success will make the supplier successful. Encourage 
the supplier to be proactive and come up with proposals. Provide it the 
platform for their ideas to be listened to and dedicate resources to drive 
execution.
How to Work with Integrate Suppliers
A successful Integrate relationship thrives on a shared vision and willing-
ness to act as one smoothly running, extended enterprise. Set the stage 
for this by driving consistency across your own divisions, functions, and 
hierarchies in terms of meeting needs, budgets, and timelines with this 
supplier. This model makes sense only if both parties benefit in terms of 
profit, revenue, and growth, which means they both should be mindful 
of market shifts and how they may affect the other. For example, should 
a supplier’s competitor offer the same product at a lower price, work 
with your Integrate supplier to meet this price by trimming specifications 
or improving productivity. Continually look for mutual cost reduction 
opportunities as well. When both parties understand each other’s core 
competencies, they can avoid duplications and start acting as a single 
entity.
Note
■
■
  With Integrate suppliers, you meet challenges and exploit opportunities together in 
all regards. If a product fails in the marketplace for any reason, both should feel the pain and 
work together on a solution. To do this, you must understand each other’s core competencies 
and what each of you brings to the ecosystem that you have jointly orchestrated.

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”

The integration makes sense only if both parties benefit in terms of profit, 
revenue, and growth, which means that both should be mindful of market 
shifts and how they may affect the other. You need to be able and willing to 
provide meaningful volume to the supplier and, in return, increase overall 
significance to its business.
Governance
Getting back to building a highly integrated relationship with one of your 
suppliers, commitment can be demonstrated by defining a mission state-
ment that declares the scope and purpose of a winning ecosystem. To 
make this relationship work, an executive sponsor is needed on both 
sides—chosen not based on hierarchy level but rather on their ability to 
drive alignment across functions, business, and hierarchies.
The effort will focus on jointly managing selected portfolio segments or 
even the whole portfolio, as we have observed in some cases. Manage 
the relationship very closely. Do not shy away from putting your A-team 
behind it and encourage your supplier to do the same. Encourage very 
close collaboration and, if needed, colocate joint teams close to decision 
makers. Schedule regular review meetings with management and execu-
tive sponsors, and foster a candid exchange of dialogue to eliminate any 
roadblocks to success. Typically, we would expect these to be needed on 
a frequent basis, depending on the speed of the industry. Weekly, monthly, 
or quarterly would be appropriate.
Case Example #1
Let’s look at an example from the beverage industry: energy drinks. This 
was a relatively new market in the 1980s, when there were two prod-
uct streams: one focused on endurance athletes who needed to hydrate 
their bodies and provide a sufficient level of electrolytes during high-effort 
sports, such as cycling. A new use and target group then emerged in the 
late 1980s: nightclub goers who used energy drinks as a way to stay awake 
and alert throughout the craze of the night. The success of the latter was 
driven by a company that had all of its production and supply chain out-
sourced to one single company. That company was Red Bull and its then 
partner that remains today was Rauch. In the 1980s, Rauch, a maker of fruit 
juices that was founded after World War I, put its belief in a single-person 
company—Dietrich Mateschitz with Red Bull—creating a great marketing 
plan and becoming its sole bottler. In return, Red Bull agreed not to work 
with any other bottling company. Such a commitment was risky for both 
parties, but Red Bull’s product strength and Rauch’s distribution capabili-
ties in 90 countries made for a powerful integrated approach across the 
two businesses.
www.it-ebooks.info

109
Supplier Relationship Management
Today, almost 30 years later, Red Bull enjoys the largest worldwide mar-
ket share in its category, selling in over 160 countries. Nevertheless, the 
company has remained true to its mission, and it doesn’t own a single 
factory or truck to deliver its distinctive cans to the stores. The bottler 
Rauch has remained the sole supplier and still does not work for any 
other energy drink company. Almost half of the worldwide product is 
mixed and filled in two production locations in Europe.
So, what were the success factors of such a deep partnership and virtually 
integrated company? In the industry, there is an urban legend suggesting 
that this type of relationship is governed only by a handshake between 
both founders. While this would no doubt prove untrue for an enterprise 
of this magnitude—you can’t seriously expect to manage business with-
out any legal contracts—in the case of these two companies the contract 
itself consisted of several pages and has been left in the drawer for several 
years. The two businesses are so well aligned with each other, understand-
ing each other’s objectives and sharing key data, that they are seamlessly 
integrated. Having experienced hypergrowth in the second decade of the 
company, both partners had to review their combined ecosystem to allow 
for worldwide expansion. They considered the option of expanding and 
opening overseas operations, but in the end the close proximity of the 
Alps to pristine water and an extremely well-oiled system won. No other 
supplier, even some of the much larger bottlers with a much stronger 
presence across the world, could match what this partnership has built in 
the first ten years of its symbiotic existence.
Building on the success it had with Rauch, Red Bull is driving a model of 
very tight collaboration and building ecosystems with other key suppli-
ers in its supply chain. The cans are still made by one main supplier that 
recently announced it would build a new factory literally wall-to-wall with 
the bottler’s factory to create a highly agile supply chain. The distribution 
is similarly managed by a single logistics group delivering the product all 
over the world.
So, with its size and financial muscle, why did Red Bull not buy Rauch and 
its other key suppliers? The answer lies in company culture and econo-
mies of scale. The energy drink is still a relatively small market for bottled 
drinks. Rauch remains one of the major regional juice makers, thus giving 
it large economies of scale as compared to if it were only present in the 
Red Bull energy drink business. Same goes for all its other suppliers. Red 
Bull, on the other hand, is a company very focused on its young, fresh, 
and sporty company culture and embracing marketing and advertising as 
its core competence. Mixing this with operations would require making 
sacrifices, and over time the culture would change.

The ecosystem that has been created in the partnership allows each 
organization to focus on its core competence and the value it brings to 
the overall “system.” This is advantageous vs. a full merger of the com-
panies concerned, which would introduce greater internal managerial 
complexity.
“Worst Advertising” Label Rankles  
Heartland
In order to keep on top of things at Heartland, Thomas had 
developed the habit of maintaining a dashboard. It was just one 
sheet of paper on which he scored the different business units 
and functions across two dimensions—performance vs. plan. He 
overlaid this with his very personal gut feeling about the state 
of affairs. He had borrowed this approach from Autowerke’s 
chairman and had found it highly effective. Over the past months, 
Heartland’s soft drink division had persistently scored poorly 
across two dimensions. While the stagnating sales figures were 
a disappointment in themselves, Thomas worried most about the 
details behind the figures.
While Heartland’s iconic soda drinks still fared quite well 
globally, there was a worrying trend in North America. The age 
group of people between 15 and 25 were abandoning Heartland 
products in droves and instead favoring imported energy drinks. 
Heartland’s attempts to create its own brand of energy drinks had 
led to dismal results. Thomas was especially disappointed with 
the performance of his marketing team. After going through three 
agencies in two years, all they had to show was two Consumerist 
Worst Advertising Awards and horrific budget overruns.
Thomas knew that making soft drinks would do miracles for 
Heartland’s stock market performance and decided to take 
matters into his own hands going forward. From his days at 
Autowerke, he had excellent contacts at Greenway Electronics, 
one of the world’s biggest electronics device makers, which had 
taken over the smart phone market with its signature products. 
It took Thomas less than 15 minutes to have Tony Birch, 
Greenway’s legendary head of industrial design, on the phone. 
After exchanging pleasantries and praising Greenway’s latest 
smart phone, Thomas went directly to the topic: “Tony, I need 
your advice. We’re losing ground in soft drinks and somehow 
our people don’t get it. We behave like a sleepy giant, while our 
energy drink competitors are running circles around us. And our 
www.it-ebooks.info

advertising campaigns are making matters worse, to be honest.”
“Yeah, winning the Worst Advertising Award twice in a row is 
quite something,” chuckled Tony.
“Exactly. And it is not for lack of money. We have poured a 
fortune into this. I believe we need an entirely different approach, 
and honestly speaking I don’t see how we can do this from 
our big corporate headquarters in Fort Wayne. We seem to be 
completely out of touch with how young people in this country 
live, think, and feel. You guys at Greenway have demonstrated 
many times that you are capable of reinventing yourselves. You 
are setting trends that the entire world is following. How can we 
replicate this at Heartland?”
“Thomas, if someone knew how to transfer Greenland’s magic 
formula to other companies, that guy would make a fortune 
writing books about it,” Tony sympathized. “Even I, being at the 
heart of it, can’t really explain it. But I might know someone who 
could help you. Here at Greenway we do a lot of creative things 
in-house, but we also work with some outside firms. There is this 
really creative outfit further up the valley. What they are doing 
is a bit hard to describe. It is somewhere between an industrial 
design house, a consultancy, and an advertising agency. They do 
really crazy stuff for us that I can’t even talk about, but I believe 
they are what you are looking for.”
Two months later, Product Maniacs, the firm Tony had 
recommended, was making a pitch to Thomas and his executive 
team. The company had requested to meet the team at 5 a.m., 
a highly unusual time, but had been unwilling to explain its 
motives. While two of the product maniacs were outlining how 
they would cooperate with Heartland in bringing them to the 
top of the mind of young consumers in America and elsewhere, 
Wim Kock, the founder, seemed to be somewhat absent glancing 
at his smart phone. Just as doubts were forming in Thomas’s 
mind as to whether following Tony’s advice was such a smart 
thing after all, Wim suddenly jumped to his feet and took the 
notebook from which they were presenting. “Gentlemen and 
ladies, here is the reason why we asked for a meeting so early in 
the day,” he said with a clear South African twang in his voice. 
The screen flicked to a live feed from what appeared to be a 
rocket launch pad.
“What you see here is the launch of a supply mission to 
the International Space Station by a private space transport 
company. I happen to know the owner and got the third stage

Chapter 7 | The “Critical Cluster”

of the rocket painted like one of your energy drink cans. So 
while your competition is spending millions to get to the edge of 
space with a balloon, we can get you into orbit for free.” In the 
background, the rocket lifted off the launchpad with the colors of 
the Heartland energy drink clearly visible. The powerful sound 
system in the conference room made the walls shake from the 
roar of the engines.
The video of the transport ship’s liftoff and its arrival at the 
station, with the Heartland logo in plain view, quickly went viral 
on the Web. As a consequence, Heartland’s energy drink sold out 
in most of the United States for weeks to follow. The impressive 
feat by Product Maniacs made the negotiations to strike a deal 
with Heartland a mere formality. From now on, Product Maniacs 
would run all product management and marketing for the energy 
drinks and Heartland would focus on the production and supply 
chain management.
Nourishing the Critical Cluster
In this chapter, we have described the three interaction models where 
companies will likely find fewest of their suppliers. But they are where 
you should place your bets if you want to make a difference by man-
aging supplier relationships. The trick is to dedicate the right people to 
the job of providing the cross-functional expertise required to develop 
game-changing products and redefine your industry in such a way that you 
obtain significant competitive advantage.
We finished with the Critical Cluster to illustrate the uniqueness, inten-
sity, and diversity of suppliers in this grouping. Far too often, companies 
jump to conclusions and nominate too many suppliers as Influence and 
Integrate candidates. In this cluster, however, the key to success is just to 
focus on a few critical suppliers who really matter. And this means to start 
off by deprioritizing many suppliers.

Putting 
Supplier 
Interaction 
Models to Work
Start Reaping Benefits
Now that we have introduced the overall SRM framework and the nine 
supplier interaction models, it is time to discuss how to make it happen. 
Accordingly, in this chapter we discuss a number of themes.
First, we outline the dynamic nature of SRM. The TrueSRM framework 
is not static. Suppliers can change position over time. We outline how 
this can be used to your advantage in order to give suppliers aspirational 
messages. This links to the concept of primary and secondary models—
where the secondary model is the position that the supplier could reach 
or fall back to depending on performance.
We then go on to discuss the key operating-model elements that are 
needed to bring SRM to life. This includes the need for top-down deci-
sion making to determine strategic potential and for bottom-up input to 
evaluate performance. Governance models then need to be differentiated

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
114
by interaction model, and resources need to be allocated to different 
­suppliers according to their positioning.
Following this, we step back to consider the changes that take place 
once SRM is implemented and how success needs to be measured. In  
this respect, we favor a focus on competitive advantage rather than 
micromeasurement of benefits, which one often sees when implement-
ing category-sourcing strategies. In fact, we see SRM as very distinct from 
category sourcing, and we therefore devote some time to dispelling some 
common confusion as to the difference between these approaches.
Having discussed these points, we then go on to talk about how to get 
started and then how to make SRM sustainable once you have begun. 
We also catch up with how our friends at Heartland are getting on with 
SRM implementation and consider the key factors that have driven their 
success.
A Dynamic Framework
The performance of suppliers varies over time, so a supplier’s vertical 
positioning in the framework will vary as well. Also, the strategic potential 
of a supplier can change. Let’s look at moves between interaction models 
in more detail.
Onboarding New Suppliers
Suppliers that are new to a company have no performance history. 
Typically, when onboarding new suppliers, companies apply good judg-
ment and treat them with extra caution. Often this is sufficient to ensure 
a smooth onboarding without too many operational issues. Yet even so, 
serious shortcomings shown by new suppliers sometimes escape man-
agement’s attention and lead to undesirable consequences. These include 
delivery shortages or quality problems. Our recommendation is to initially 
put all new suppliers with limited strategic potential into the Mitigate cat-
egory until they have proven that their performance meets the expected 
level. If a new supplier in that category shows issues, it should be phased 
out without hesitation.
If you identify a promising new supplier that could make a difference, place 
it in the Develop category and dedicate company resources to bring it up 
to speed as quickly as possible.
For the rare diamond in the rough that is found occasionally, we recom-
mend you go into Bail Out mode from day one. This is clearly a valuable 
relationship that you do not want to ruin by avoidable performance issues. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
115
The Bail Out mode will enable you to get through these challenges and 
ensure that the company gains the projected competitive benefit from 
working with this supplier.
Supplier Moves You Are Driving
Not every model in the framework has a logical path to a neighboring 
model. Upward moves are perfectly possible and always desired. Suppliers 
can improve their performance with or without the company’s support, 
performance you can recognize in the regular performance reviews.
The horizontal position in the framework is nearly locked in by the 
­particularities of the supplier’s business. Moves to the right require the 
supplier to significantly change its nature. The only possible move in this 
direction that we expect to see leads from Influence to Integrate. Think 
about a supplier who defines an industry standard. If that supplier is ready 
to provide products and services that allow you to achieve a sustainable 
competitive advantage, we would place it in the Integrate box. We are 
seeing elements of this behavior in several industries.
In addition to the vertical and horizontal moves, there is one possible 
diagonal move. If a high-strategic-potential supplier falls into a Bail Out 
situation, you have two options: Either you improve its performance so 
that it justifies its high potential or you aim to make the supplier less 
critical. Creating a viable alternative by qualifying another supplier to 
take over a portion of the volume share would move this supplier to the 
Sustain model. In that position, the supplier will be given the opportunity 
to recover its standing.
Finally, there is one move leading from Mitigate out of the framework 
altogether. This is because you are terminating business with that supplier 
unless and until there is a compelling reason to work with it again.
All of these supplier moves are illustrated in Figure 8-1.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
116
Primary and Secondary Interaction Models
The notion that the TrueSRM framework is not static extends to the 
question of whether or not a supplier can fall into more than one interac-
tion model at any point in time. Generally speaking, the idea of the SRM 
framework is to map the supplier as one entity and not break the mapping 
down to a category level.
While this is the rule, when communicating the framework and the 
­positioning to suppliers, you should aim to send aspirational messages. 
Compare this to the annual feedback discussion you have with an employee. 
In this discussion, you would not tell the employee that she is locked into 
her current role and that the next level is out of reach. In order to allow 
for aspirational messages, we therefore introduced primary and secondary 
interaction models.
Following the logic of the moves introduced above, the aspirational 
­messages should generally trend upward. For example, a supplier in 
Improve that is doing really well across several categories could receive 
the following message:
You know, we are really quite happy with your performance 
lately. Across categories A, B, and C you are actually best in 
class. We specifically like your proposal to become your launch 
customer for the new product technology in category A. In our

SRM framework, we have now added Influence as secondary 
interaction model to Sustain. In order to get you into Influence 
for good, you would need to fix the delivery issues with the 
mainstream categories D and E.
Obviously, the secondary interaction model also can be used to send 
messages in the opposite direction when your happiness with a supplier 
is decreasing:
We have had you in Integrate for several years now. Our 
partnership has yielded several game-changing products and 
we have always appreciated your willingness to build a winning 
ecosystem with us. However, over the past months we have 
gotten increasingly concerned about a change of attitude that 
might be best summarized as complacency. You have let too 
many deadlines slip and the product quality was not always what 
we had expected. We want you to get more focused again, and 
in order to emphasize this message, we are adding the secondary 
interaction model Invest to our relationship.
Let us now take a look at who is preparing and delivering these messages.
Overarching SRM Decision Making
No, we don’t want to introduce another administrative body. We firmly 
believe that corporate cultures are already overburdened with commit-
tees of all kinds. What we intend to do is to take existing cross-functional 
decision-making bodies and use them for SRM purposes.
In essence, SRM requires two types of decision making at the corporate 
level. One is bottom-up decision making regarding the evaluation of sup-
plier performance. Another is top-down decision making that determines 
the strategic potential.
For evaluating performance, most companies will have cross-functional 
teams in place. The challenge is that they act in isolation while SRM needs 
a comprehensive perspective. In Chapter 5, we discussed segmentation 
criteria and forced ranking in detail. Here, we want to limit the discussion 
to who is actually making these slotting decisions. We recommend having 
as much of a big-picture view as possible. So, if at all feasible, the company 
should force-rank all of its suppliers. This will work for companies that 
have relatively homogeneous lines of business. For those companies, cross-
functional teams should spotlight the exceptions to their leaders, meaning 
the really-outstanding and really-poor-performing suppliers. The leaders 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
118
should then get together to assess these exceptions. With this approach, 
90 percent of suppliers will fall in the middle category and debate will be 
limited to 10 percent of suppliers, normally a doable task.
For companies with a diverse set of businesses—think ThyssenKrupp 
with steel mills, shipyards, engineering services, automotive suppliers, 
and elevator makers—force ranking all suppliers will not make sense. 
For these types of conglomerates, we recommend applying performance 
ranking at the level of each individual line of business, or for each distinct 
subsidiary.
Determining the strategic potential of a supplier should be done top 
down by the cross-functional leadership team. Once a year, the leaders 
get together and decide which of the suppliers have a medium or a high 
strategic potential. Again, we assume that less than 10 percent of suppliers 
will fall into these two categories and therefore that the task will be perfectly 
manageable.
Note
■
■
  When determining the strategic potential of your suppliers, remember that in most 
cases only 10 percent of them will be in a position to help you gain competitive advantages.
Governance Models by Supplier
For suppliers in the Harvest, Improve, and Sustain categories, not much 
will change. You will continue measuring their performance periodically 
and provide feedback. While their positioning in the framework will not 
be a secret, you will not proactively communicate it. Other than working 
to improve their performance, there is not much the suppliers can do to 
change their positioning.
Suppliers that fall into the Mitigate, Develop, and Bail Out interaction 
models will not be engaged in a broader discussion of their relationship. 
Time is often critical and matters are urgent, so specific business needs to 
improve performance or address failings will dominate the agenda.
Where things will change significantly is in the Influence, Integrate, and 
Invest interaction models. You will proactively inform suppliers in these 
categories as to where they stand, develop clear roadmaps and account 
plans, and drive aligned agendas through joint steering committees. In 
particular:
For Influence suppliers, you will focus on formalizing 
• 
the process to bring into sync your respective prod-
uct, technology, and service roadmaps. In order to 
make this happen, a cross-functional steering group 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
119
will not only ensure smooth communication with 
the supplier but also establish consistency across 
Procurement, Engineering, and Product Marketing. 
With this fine-tuned approach, you will be able to 
win where it matters.
Invest suppliers will initially receive a lot of ­feedback 
• 
from you. What used to be isolated performance 
reports will be condensed into a thoroughly 
researched performance gap analysis. This analysis 
will be shared with the supplier’s senior executives, 
together with clear performance targets. You will 
assign program managers to drive improvement and 
dedicate substantial executive attention to guiding 
the supplier in the right direction.
Working with Integrate suppliers will be the master-
• 
piece of your SRM efforts. First, you will develop a 
mission statement together with the supplier, specify-
ing what it is that you want to achieve jointly. Then, 
you will define a step-by-step roadmap that describes 
how the supplier can earn the right to exclusively 
“own” a product market segment. A binding incen-
tive mechanism will ensure that your objectives and 
those of the supplier are fully aligned, and that both 
parties act as partners with an entrepreneurial spirit. 
Finally, a joint executive leadership team will oversee 
the product market segments in scope from a holis-
tic, end-to-end perspective.
Roles in SRM
As we have seen, each of the nine supplier interaction models has its 
specific governance structure. There are several common denominators, 
though, that are relevant across the entire SRM framework.
First and foremost, the old principle of presenting one face to the ­supplier 
should be followed. We know it is easier said than done, but if suppliers 
are able to put a key account manager in place, customers should ­certainly 
be able to appoint one relationship owner as well.
Tip

  The supplier should, ideally, deal with one customer point person. Whom you choose, 
however, is critical.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
120
The position of the supplier in the SRM framework will largely determine 
the seniority and functional affiliation of the relationship owner—the pri-
mary “go to” person who is responsible for managing the relationship 
with the supplier. For suppliers that are in Harvest, Improve, and Mitigate, 
the relationship owner will most likely come from Procurement. Given the 
low strategic potential, involvement from other functions will be limited.  
The seniority level of the relationship owner will correlate with the spend-
ing that is attributed to that supplier.
Who Is the Best Relationship Owner?
For suppliers in Develop, an engineering or manufacturing representative 
might be appointed as relationship owner. Typically, these functions have 
the strongest vested interest in bringing this promising new supplier up 
to speed and making it ready to bring new products and services to the 
market.
For suppliers in Sustain, the relationship owner will probably come from 
the function that has the highest level of interaction with that supplier. 
If, for example, you are dealing with a marketing-and-advertising firm, 
it would come naturally for a senior marketing executive to own the 
relationship.
Moving on to Influence, the choice will vary by industry. If it is about a 
supplier that defines an industry standard, the relationship might even be 
owned by the CEO. This will, for example, be the case for an airline, where 
the chief executive will own the relationship to Boeing and Airbus.
In Integrate, owning the relationship will be highly time-consuming given 
the complexity of the relationship and the associated cognitive load. It is 
unlikely that a candidate at the top executive level can be freed up from 
other duties to attend to the required extent; therefore, the relationship 
owner will probably be a mid-ranking executive who is highly respected 
internally and passionate about building a game-changing ecosystem.
For Invest suppliers, the relationship owner will mostly guide the sup-
plier in comprehensive programs to build capabilities. Given the nature 
of this task, the relationship owner will most likely have a technical 
background.
Bail Out suppliers follow their own rules. As the Bail Out will be governed 
by a task force or tiger team, the leader of this team will take over the 
ownership of the relationship from the regular relationship owner for the 
duration of the bailout.

Maintaining Consistency in Your Message
Once the consistency in the communication channel is established, you 
need to ensure consistency in content. Today, most companies do have 
supplier evaluation processes established. Regardless of whether they are 
as structured as we suggest in Chapter 5 or not, sending confusing mes-
sages to suppliers is a common pitfall. We have seen quarterly supplier 
evaluations fluctuate so wildly that even the most well-meaning supplier 
will not be able to make any sense of the feedback it receives.
As a fix, we suggest making the supplier evaluation simple and focusing it 
on a few key criteria that really matter. Also, the cross-functional team 
that produces these evaluations should be characterized by continuity. 
The relationship owner should have the final say in the rating and feed-
back the supplier receives.
Employing Account Plans
With consistency in communication and content established, the cross-
functional team needs to align on where to drive the supplier. Account 
plans have been found useful in this context. The account plan describes 
at a high level where the relationship with the supplier should be heading 
mid- to long-term. Once this account plan has been agreed upon by inter-
nal stakeholders, it is usually shared with the supplier. It is good for the 
supplier to understand what its customer’s intention is and what it could 
get out of the relationship if this intention is fulfilled.
Meetings with Suppliers
This leaves the final communication topic of regular meetings with sup-
pliers. Suppliers in Harvest, Improve, and Mitigate do not require large 
formal meetings, and can be dealt with more on an ad hoc basis, such as 
when the sales representative happens to make his usual call.
For all other suppliers, you should provide a great deal of attention to the 
preparation and execution of meetings. We have seen quarterly meetings 
deteriorate into a ritual that can be best compared to going to mass on 
Sunday. The representative for the supplier comes to the sermon and 
listens, confesses the company’s sins, promises to do better in the future, 
walks out, and continues with business as usual. This is a massive missed 
opportunity. It takes a great deal of effort and money to get key stakehold-
ers from both parties into one room. As a general rule, the relationship 
owners from both sides should agree on the key topics to be covered in 
the sequence of meetings over the next year or so, based on the account

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
122
plan. Then, the functional teams from both sides should be tasked with 
preparing meaningful status reports and outlooks with regard to the prog-
ress vs. the account plan. Bringing this more forward-looking mindset into 
meetings with suppliers adds a lot of value to the relationship.
Where to Put Resources
As already hinted at in the previous paragraph, our SRM framework will 
lead to a quite substantial reallocation of resources. Among other things, 
our aim is to help companies to put their resources where it really mat-
ters. Today, in most companies the available resources are spread rela-
tively evenly across suppliers.
We are suggesting a highly asymmetric allocation, starting with manag-
ing at arm’s length the vast majority of suppliers that reside in Improve 
and Harvest. Managing these suppliers can tie up a lot of resources, but 
if you are brutally honest, you will see there is little to gain by spending 
as much time and effort as you do. This is why we recommend having 
relatively junior procurement people own the relationships with these 
suppliers.
Suppliers in Mitigate can still be managed by relatively junior procure-
ment people but will require more of a time commitment. This is why 
we recommend making decisions swiftly. Having a supplier hanging in this 
interaction model for more than a couple of months would definitely be 
wrong.
Note
■
■
  Suppliers shouldn’t reside in the Mitigate category for more than a couple of months. 
By that point, if you have done your job properly, they should be moved up or out.
The heavy resource allocation should be at the opposite end of the SRM 
framework—in Integrate, Invest, and, if needed, in Bail Out. With Integrate 
suppliers, you should aspire to build a winning ecosystem that will allow 
game-changing moves. It is evident that these relationships should be pri-
oritized over all others and have the first call on any available resource. 
This is where the company will win or lose ultimately.
For suppliers in Invest, the resource allocation should be more cautious. 
After all, we believe these suppliers could become great partners but we 
still need the proof of concept. Therefore, the emphasis in Invest is to 
guide the investments of the supplier in terms of funds and talent alloca-
tion without committing too many of the own resources.
www.it-ebooks.info

123
Bailouts will drain substantial resources when they occur. But there is 
little we can do about this. Our recommendation is to front-load bailouts 
by sending people to be there (physically) without hesitation. The old 
proverb “Better being safe than sorry” still applies and we have seen that 
too many companies hesitate in the critical early days of a bailout. These 
highly nonstandard situations cannot be solved via e-mail and phone calls; 
having boots on the ground early makes a big difference.
Suppliers in the middle three interaction models should receive resources 
but with caution. For suppliers in Influence, the key question is, “Can they 
be influenced?” If the supplier is ready to engage in collaborations that 
lead to a tangible competitive advantage, committing resources makes 
perfect sense. But all of us have seen the skillful efforts of suppliers that 
define an industry standard that only maintain the status quo. Accepting 
invitations to conferences, dinners, and golf courses can be a useful way to 
build a rapport of trust and mutual understanding. But these things have 
to provide a yield. If nothing tangible has surfaced after a year, it should 
become clear that the supplier does not want to engage under the terms 
of this interaction model. After this realization, it seems appropriate to sit 
down with the supplier and explain that you are scaling back the relation-
ship to Sustain.
In Sustain, the resource requirement should be minimal. Efforts should be 
limited to reminding the supplier of the growth potential that would open 
up if it improved its performance.
Suppliers in Develop will receive quite a lot of support and resources. 
One way to justify this commitment is to have the supplier pay for it.  
A best-practice example from the automotive industry is to establish sup-
plier development teams that act like external consultants. These teams 
have daily rates that get charged to the suppliers, who are encouraged to 
use these services. A positive side effect of this practice is that a supplier 
will take services it has to pay for more seriously.
What Changes for Suppliers
With the SRM framework in place, everything changes for suppliers. 
Imagine your company having one common language to define supplier 
relationships, alignment across functions, alignment across lines of busi-
ness, and alignment across hierarchy levels! In this scenario, we will see 
winners and losers among suppliers.
Those suppliers that so far have dedicated most of their time to playing 
games, to finding the weak link in your organization will lose under these 
new terms. Their scheming and politicking will be brought to unforgiving 
daylight and they will have little time to adjust.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
124
The winners will be suppliers that always had good intentions but were 
frustrated by conflicting messages and lack of clear direction. They will 
finally find a framework they can plug into and find their spot to best add 
value.
HOW TO MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF SRM
SRM cannot be measured in terms of cost savings. This is what category-sourcing 
strategies are about. At the highest level, the success of SRM can be measured 
by the incremental competitive advantage that can be attributed to suppliers. 
Competitive advantage will mean different things to different companies, but it can 
manifest itself as follows:
Successful product and service innovations that have been 
• 
brought to market and helped the company gain market 
share
A higher profit margin due to higher price levels that can be 
• 
achieved in the market and those due to overall reduced 
cost of goods sold
Higher availability rates and shorter delivery lead times
• 
Better product and service quality, better and easier service, 
• 
and happier customers
How SRM Relates to Category-Sourcing 
Strategies 
In the process of developing the SRM framework, we have noticed wide-
ranging confusion about the distinction between SRM and category strat-
egies. In some literature, SRM is even defined as the implementation stage 
of a category strategy.
For the following comparison of SRM and category strategies, we are 
referring to the Purchasing Chessboard as the standard framework for 
developing category strategies.
As discussed in earlier chapters, the Purchasing Chessboard was devel-
oped by A. T. Kearney consultants in 2008 and has since been applied by 
thousands of companies across all industries and continents. The idea 
behind the Purchasing Chessboard is that category-sourcing strategies 
should be based upon considerations around demand power and supply 
power.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
125
A company has a high demand power if its spending for a certain category 
represents a significant portion of the overall supply industry revenue 
in that sector. Additional factors that increase demand power are the 
opportunities for innovations that suppliers can draw from working with 
the company and the image boost a supplier would get from having the 
company on its reference list.
Similarly, a supplier has a high supply power if its revenue within a certain 
category represents a significant portion of the overall supply industry 
revenue in that sector. Additional factors that increase supply power are 
the ability of the supplier to drive innovation for the category and to cre-
ate a pull with the company’s customers (think of  “Intel inside”). Suppliers 
that own critical patents and are monopolists in a certain sector enjoy the 
highest supply power.
The Purchasing Chessboard is defined by two axes, demand power and 
supply power (Figure 8-2). At the highest level, the chessboard is seg-
mented into four quadrants:
• 
High demand power: An example is a big carmaker  
(e.g., Volkswagen) that buys forged parts. There must 
be hundreds, if not thousands, of forged-part manufac-
turers throughout the world, and out of those there 
must be at least several dozen that are qualified to 
meet Volkswagen’s quality and volume requirements. 
In this case, Volkswagen is a buyer in a position of 
overwhelming power vis-à-vis its forgings suppliers, 
and it is able to exploit competition among its suppli-
ers to its own advantage.
• 
High supply and demand power: If Volkswagen now 
wishes to buy engine management systems from Bosch, 
the situation is completely different. In many segments,  
Bosch holds a de facto monopoly. Nevertheless, 
Bosch is just as dependent on the big carmakers as 
they are on Bosch. In this case, securing joint, long-
term advantages is unquestionably in the interest of 
both parties.
• 
High supply power: Even the demand power of a big 
carmaker has its limits, especially when oligopolistic 
market conditions prevail. A good example is the 
purchasing of traded commodities, such as platinum 
for catalysts. While Volkswagen certainly purchases a 
large quantity of platinum, it is fully dependent upon 
the quoted prices of metal exchanges. Companies

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work

confronted by high supply power will consistently 
strive to bring about fundamental change in the 
nature of the demand in order to free themselves 
from the control of the supplier.
• 
Low supply and demand power: An example of low 
demand power on the part of a big carmaker is air 
travel. The situation is more balanced than in the pre-
ceding example, however, since deregulation of the 
airline market has actually produced results. Along 
with negotiating discounts, a key question to ask in 
this context is whether traveling by plane is neces-
sary or whether it could be avoided altogether. Thus, 
the company is largely able to steer its own demand.

The four quadrants of the Purchasing Chessboard also represent its four 
basic strategies—leveraging competition among suppliers, seeking joint 
advantage with suppliers, changing the rules of the game, and managing 
spend. These are shown in Figure 8-2.
The most detailed version of the Purchasing Chessboard is comprised of 
64 detailed methods—16 associated with each basic strategy. This is the 
one typically in use by procurement executives who are developing cat-
egory strategies with their teams. The detailed version of the Purchasing 
Chessboard is shown in Figure 8-3.1

In our view, SRM and the Purchasing Chessboard cover very different 
areas and have quite different objectives. While SRM is about leverag-
ing a company’s size and driving desired supplier behavior, the Purchasing 
Chessboard is about developing the right category strategies. As out-
lined in the previous paragraph, success is measured by very different 
key performance indicators as well. The success of SRM is measured by 
competitive advantage achieved and defined very broadly. The success 
of the application of the Purchasing Chessboard is predominantly mea-
sured by cost reductions achieved with suppliers. At a secondary level, 
the Purchasing Chessboard also aims at creating value with suppliers, but 
this value creation is always strictly linked to a given category.
Let’s now examine if there is a correlation between the SRM framework 
and the Purchasing Chessboard.

Suppliers in Harvest, Improve, and Mitigate have low strategic potential with 
categories that can fall almost anywhere on the Purchasing Chessboard. 
The only area on the chessboard that will be mostly untapped by catego-
ries provided by these suppliers is the upper-right quadrant representing 
the “Seek joint advantage with suppliers” basic strategy. The reason for 
this is that high supply power and high demand power in the upper-right-
hand side quadrant of the chessboard would translate into medium or 
even high strategic potential.
Suppliers that fall into Influence, Sustain, Develop, Integrate, Invest, and Bail 
Out in the SRM framework have medium or high strategic potential with 
categories that can fall almost anywhere on the Purchasing Chessboard. 
The only other area of the purchasing that will be mostly untapped by cat-
egories provided by these suppliers is the lower-left-hand-side quadrant, 
representing the “Manage spend” basic strategy. The reason for this is 
that low supply power and low demand power in this quadrant translate 
into low strategic potential.
For suppliers that fall into Bail Out, the category or product that causes 
the bailout will almost certainly sit in the upper half of the chessboard. 
This category or product will involve a novel technology that this supplier 
has been one of the very few players on the planet to master. The supplier 
therefore enjoys high supply power for this product.
With these considerations in mind, we can summarize that at a high level, 
the SRM framework and the Purchasing Chessboard are mutually indepen-
dent tools. The only exception is the Strategic Potential axis in the SRM 
framework, which is weakly correlated with the Purchasing Chessboard 
in the following ways:
Low Strategic Potential in the SRM framework 
• 
excludes the combination of high supply power and 
high demand power in the Purchasing Chessboard.
Medium and high Strategic Potential in the SRM 
• 
framework exclude the combination of low supply 
power and low demand power in the Purchasing 
Chessboard.
How to Get Started
The SRM framework in this book is structured, repeatable, and scalable. 
Putting it to work is more of a change-management effort than an intel-
lectual challenge. In our experience, suppliers appreciate the introduction 
of the framework, but internal resistance should be expected.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management

Note
■
■
  Expect resistance to the SRM framework internally. As always, it’s easier to maintain 
the status quo. To attain meaningful change, top executives must endorse the initiative and see 
the change through.
Resistance will first build against one of the key objectives of SRM—
leveraging the company’s size. Realizing this objective will require coor-
dination across functions, lines of business, and hierarchy levels. Out of 
routine, for all involved players, it will be easier to do what they have done 
in the past and go out to engage with the supplier without coordinating 
upfront. Change here will not come without strong endorsement from 
the very top of the organization. We recommend using a very simple line 
to convince the CEO to lend his or her endorsement. The best argu-
ment is to equate suppliers with customers. Everyone usually understands 
readily that internal alignment and consistent messages are needed when 
dealing with customers. The use of key account management and CRM 
(Customer Relationship Management) is well-established on the “sell” 
side. The same disciplines are consequently needed on the “buy side,” 
namely, SRM.
Resistance will also be strong when the initial segmentation of suppliers 
takes place. Too many owners of supplier relationships will want to see 
“their” suppliers in the top-right-hand corner of the SRM framework. We 
cautioned against the inflationary use of the term partner in the intro-
duction of this book. And we agree that it is a nicer job to inform a 
­supplier that it resides in Integrate than to explain why Sustain or Harvest 
are more appropriate. The following steps have worked well for avoiding 
resistance to the results of the segmentation:
Compare team members’ segmentation to their 
• 
annual performance evaluations. No organization 
would tolerate having all employees in the top cate-
gory. This would make the evaluation process mean-
ingless and demotivate top performers. The same is 
true in SRM.
Refrain from overcommunicating the segmentation 
• 
results. Suppliers with low strategic potential—that 
is, those in Harvest, Improve, and Mitigate—do not 
need to be informed about the SRM framework 
and their positioning at all. We are talking about 
90 percent of suppliers here and with this measure, 
the workload associated with getting SRM going is

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
130
reduced as well. There is also no need for keeping 
SRM a secret, though, and all interested suppliers will 
eventually learn about it. But for those 90 percent, 
the time when they actively ask is an early-enough 
point at which to inform them.
Work with primary and secondary interaction mod-
• 
els. As previously explained, the primary interaction 
model indicates where the supplier really sits today, 
but the secondary interaction model can be used to 
deliver a more aspirational message.
The most resistance can be expected when a supplier is entering the 
Integrate interaction model. Let’s discuss this by looking at a case 
example.
Case Example
A major carmaker with several brands had a colorful relationship history 
with its largest supplier of interior systems. Interior systems encompassed 
everything that the passengers in the car could see, touch, smell, and hear. 
Many executives at the carmaker agreed that the supplier had played a 
crucial role in making several car lines very successful in the market, but 
there had also been ups and downs in the relationship.
What counted for the carmaker was to achieve a high market share at 
a competitive cost. Since the interior system accounted for a significant 
portion of the externally sourced expenditure of a car, the supplier was 
the key focus of several past cost-reduction initiatives. The supplier got 
sourced many times and now claimed to be in the red with several prod-
uct lines. The carmaker did not believe this and substantial management 
resources were dedicated on both sides to haggle over cost.
From the perspective of the supplier, it was quite hard to do business with 
the carmaker. It got conflicting messages when talking to Procurement, 
Engineering, and Product Management. Also, the different brands of the 
carmaker were not aligned with regard to the supplier. The supplier could 
be in favor with one brand while falling out of favor with another. At the 
top, the CEOs of the two companies entertained a quite-active com-
munication channel but did not align internally, which led to additional  
confusion, mostly to the disadvantage of the supplier.
In summary, all these factors had pushed the supplier into a reactive 
­mindset. The supplier had sat back and waited for the carmaker to give 
instructions, based on which the supplier would execute. Whenever there 
had been a disagreement, the supplier would respond, “But you told me 
to do so.”
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
131
At a certain point in time, key players at the carmaker recognized that 
there was a big missed opportunity with this supplier. With sluggish global 
car markets and increased competition from new competitors, there was 
a realization that the future of the automotive industry would be deter-
mined by a competition of ecosystems. They then defined five key success 
factors for the collaboration with the supplier:
1.	 Bringing the supplier in for the concept phase already 
as a partner with equal rights
2.	 Granting the supplier exclusivity in certain product 
market segments
3.	 Sharing responsibility for volume, price, and margin 
with the supplier
4.	 Making engineering, marketing, and procurement 
decisions jointly with the supplier
5.	 Clearly aligning competencies to avoid duplications 
and overlaps
First and foremost, the supplier needed to be elevated from its reactive 
mindset. With the supplier just executing the instructions and specifica-
tions of the carmaker, major opportunities were lost. Not only did the 
carmaker not leverage the vast experience and insight of the supplier into 
its recent developments in interior systems, but the specifications it devel-
oped often were difficult and expensive to make. Bringing the supplier in 
for the concept phase already as a partner with equal rights led to a true 
paradigm shift. Resident engineers and product planners from the supplier 
joined the carmaker’s cross-functional product-development teams. The 
supplier’s experts completely changed the way the carmaker was looking 
at interior systems. For the first time, the carmaker’s key source of inspi-
ration was not the models that competitors displayed at auto shows but 
the input of the supplier, which involved very concrete and feasible ideas 
on how the interior system of the future should really look.
For the supplier to open up so radically to the carmaker, it needed assur-
ances that its breakthrough ideas would not just be taken from it and then 
realized with one of its competitors. Therefore, the carmaker granted the 
supplier exclusivity for those car lines for which the supplier had injected 
its breakthrough ideas. There also was a very explicit understanding that 
this exclusivity had no limits. Provided that the carmaker’s volume and 
profitability targets for the car lines in the scope of the agreement were 
met, the scope would be expanded to additional car lines. In the best case, 
the supplier would eventually own the interior systems of all car lines. 
Under that agreement, it was also made clear that car lines within the 
scope would be out of reach for the supplier’s competitors. Since it had

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
132
so heavily influenced the overall design of the interior system, a competi-
tive quote that would just cover making and assembling the parts would 
be considered irrelevant.
As an assurance for the carmaker that the supplier would not just lean 
back and relax, a set of strict incentives and penalties were agreed upon. In 
fact, the supplier shared the entrepreneurial risk for the car lines in scope. 
It took some time for the supplier to agree to this principle, but once 
comprehensive marketing research confirmed that the interior system 
was indeed a key criterion for the end customers’ buying decision, the 
supplier agreed. In the incentive and penalty scheme, volume, price, and 
margin targets for the car lines were established. For every unit of positive 
deviation from the target, the supplier would receive a bonus payment; for 
every unit of negative deviation from the target, the supplier would have 
to pay a penalty.
In order to agree to the incentive-and-penalty scheme, the supplier 
requested that it have a say in all operations, marketing, and sales deci-
sions concerning the car lines in scope. After some hesitation, the car-
maker understood that there was no way to avoid doing this and opened 
up to the supplier. Functional task forces, staffed from both the carmaker 
and the supplier, were established to work on day-to-day decision making. 
A joint executive steering committee would now provide strategic guid-
ance to these task forces.
Under the cost pressures of a sluggish market, both parties then looked 
into synergy potentials. This initiative was driven by the carmaker, which 
first revisited its core competencies in interior systems. Everything that 
was not considered noncore was by definition to be performed by the 
supplier. This exercise yielded head-count savings across several functions 
with by far the biggest chunk in engineering.
Creating Momentum for SRM
Implementing any of the five key success factors will meet a substantial 
level of internal resistance in any company. Bringing the supplier in as a 
partner with equal rights at the concept stage will frighten engineering 
and product-marketing people. Granting the supplier exclusivity for cer-
tain product market segments will raise concerns about losing leverage 
and competitiveness. Sharing responsibility for fundamental operations, 
sales, and marketing with a supplier will be a stretch for all involved par-
ties. And aligning core competencies, with the resulting reduction in head 
counts, will clearly not be welcomed by those affected.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
133
So, how can the required momentum to introduce SRM be created? As 
usual, it is the right combination of focus, quick wins, and baby steps. 
Focusing on those suppliers that will make a difference is the first ingre-
dient for success. Suppliers in Influence, Integrate, and Invest are those 
that really warrant the attention of scarce management resources. Even 
in companies that have thousands of suppliers, not more than a couple 
of handfuls of suppliers will fall into those three interaction models. 
Therefore, focusing on those suppliers will ensure that resources for SRM 
are not spread too thin.
Delivering a couple of quick wins is paramount. If SRM enables a new 
technology from an Influence supplier to be used with a customer, a hot-
selling product to be developed with an Integrate supplier, and a tangible 
performance breakthrough to be achieved with an Invest supplier, many 
stakeholders will want to join the bandwagon. Therefore, a lot of thought 
should be dedicated to what these quick wins can be even before rolling 
out SRM.
Finally, taking baby steps in a controlled, manageable environment is better 
than drowning in complexity. In the automotive interior systems example 
just looked at, the Integrate relationship with the supplier was initially 
limited to two car lines. Those car lines had a team of executives that was 
generally friendly and supportive to the SRM initiative. They provided an 
environment in which quick wins could flourish and attempts to derail the 
idea were deemed to be unlikely.
How to Make SRM Sustainable
In order to be sustainable, SRM must evolve from the initiative status 
to being embedded in the company’s culture, organization, and DNA. 
Realistically, this will be a multiyear process with numerous setbacks and 
disappointments. Therefore, it is important for the company’s leadership 
team to keep the eye on the prize. If done right, SRM will become a 
­competitive advantage that cannot be substituted by old-school, one-size-
fits-all supplier squeezing.
Heartland’s TrueSRM In The News
Let’s return to the story at Heartland. We are now two years 
on from the events of the month of mayhem that are described 
in Chapter 3. Thomas, Laura, and the team have successfully 
put SRM in place. As described in Chapter 4, the procurement 
function has been transformed to focus on high-value activities and 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
134
supplier relationships. Heartland has systematically implemented 
the different interaction models across its supply base. As shown 
in Chapters 5, 6, and 7, the company has gained considerable 
benefit in the process.
Heartland’s success has started to attract considerable interest 
in the marketplace. This has come about in several ways. First, 
the restructuring of the procurement function became very well-
known externally. Heartland’s hiring of nontraditional MBA 
graduates attracted considerable attention. The subsequent 
creation of the supplier development function also became very 
well-known and was seen in some quarters as unusual for the 
food industry. However, the reporting of these developments 
did not go beyond the procurement press and specialist supply-
management blogs.
Another development also attracted considerable attention. 
This was the decision to replace the existing creative agency, 
Delta Creative. Of course, many companies replace suppliers. 
However, decisions to replace creative agencies are rarely taken 
lightly. This particular relationship was also of such long standing 
that it really did cause quite a stir. It was reported heavily in both 
the procurement press and throughout the marketing world.
So far, these developments did not attract attention in the general 
business world, nor in the mainstream business press. This all 
changed with the three developments that are outlined in Chapter 
7. First, the appearance of the Heartland energy drink brand 
in orbit and the subsequent announcement of the relationship 
with Product Maniacs caused excitement well beyond the 
marketing world. Heartland had always been seen as a very 
conservative business. Admittedly, this was perhaps a slightly 
unfair estimation. The very way that Thomas had been recruited 
as CPO from a chance meeting with the then CEO on a plane trip 
is just one example that exposes the lie in this. Nevertheless, this 
was the way that the company was seen. The relationship with 
Product Maniacs really was something else. Close observers of 
Heartland were now starting to wonder whether something more 
systematic was taking place to change things.
The second was the launch of the joint organic food range in 
conjunction with the high-end grocery EATing. Previously, 
EATing had eschewed such tie-ups with suppliers. Despite being 
a high-end food business, it had treated its private-label suppliers 
as pure subcontractors. The relationship with Heartland really 
was something else. This was picked up by the mainstream 
business press in a very significant way.
www.it-ebooks.info

The third development that really made observers feel 
that something systematic was taking place was the  
co-commercialization 
of 
the 
color-changing 
film 
with 
Caledonian. This innovation went viral in the news media and 
caused a 10 percent increase in Heartland’s stock price.
The world was now sitting up and taking notice. Perceptive 
observers were now starting to make the link that the “something” 
that was going on was related to how Heartland was working 
with external suppliers. Foremost among these observers was 
Elisabeth Huttich, a top writer for one of the leading German-
language business journals that was also syndicated in the 
English speaking world. Thomas’s role as CEO of such a 
traditionally Midwestern business as Heartland had always been 
a great human-interest story for her readers. She had interviewed 
Thomas when he became CEO at Heartland. Elisabeth was 
probably the first external observer to deduce that Heartland 
was behaving “differently” toward its external supply base. She 
reached out to Thomas and requested an interview for an article 
she decided to write called “Has Heartland Found the Secret 
Sauce for Working with Suppliers?”
So, one chilly February morning, in Fort Wayne, Elisabeth was 
ushered into Thomas’s office, where Thomas and Laura were 
there waiting for her. So was Emma Jenkins, the head of investor 
relations. She wanted to chaperone both Thomas and Laura to 
help them ensure that they were mindful of corporate codes of 
conduct with respect to price sensitive information.
Elisabeth and Thomas greeted each other with the traditional 
continental kiss on each cheek. Elisabeth had not previously 
met Laura and Emma. After introductions and some small 
talk, Elisabeth got down to business. “As I e-mailed you about, 
Thomas, I am really interested in understanding exactly what 
Heartland is doing in supplier relationship management. The 
success you are all having is amazing,” she said. “Everyone else 
seems to struggle. What are you all doing?”
Thomas looked at Laura. “Laura, you have orchestrated things. 
Why don’t you tell Elisabeth what we have been doing?” 
Then, he paused and looked at Elisabeth. “Laura can’t tell you 
everything though. We don’t want the whole world copying us 
in everything we do. We need to keep some secrets,” he said 
with a smile.
Laura then started to explain the development of the interaction 
models to Elisabeth, the use of the framework to segment the

136
supply base, and then some of the actual cases of what Heartland 
had done with specific suppliers. Elisabeth was clearly fascinated 
by Laura’s storytelling. After an hour or so, they paused as coffee 
was brought in.
Elisabeth sat back and asked: “So, Laura, was it just about having 
the framework? Lots of companies have supplier segmentation 
frameworks, but they have not achieved the type of success you 
have achieved. Was there more to it?”
“Yes,” answered Laura. “Having the right framework that focuses 
on current performance and strategic value matters. But the 
really key thing is that we have made it a living-and-breathing 
organism that is intrinsic to how we run the business. It is far 
more pervasive than a pure procurement approach.”
“How so?”
“Well. First of all, we never lose sight of what SRM is about. You 
know many companies think it is about process, score cards, or 
is somehow an adjunct to category sourcing. ”
“You do hear that,” Elisabeth agreed.
“Well, it’s not. It is about how you drive desired supplier 
behaviors. Process, score cards, and governance forums are only 
a means to an end. Too many organizations that we talk to see 
SRM in these exclusive terms. These things matter, but they must 
be implemented in context and be appropriate to the supplier’s 
interaction model and the things you are seeking to achieve.”
Elisabeth nodded in agreement.
“Second,” Laura continued, “we do not confuse SRM with category 
sourcing. We use the Purchasing Chessboard to determine our 
strategies in category sourcing. It is all about how we choose to 
buy specific goods and services that happen to have the same 
supply markets. That is not the same thing as driving desired 
supplier behavior. Not at all.”
Laura paused. “I see,” offered Elisabeth. She thought for a couple 
of seconds. “Are they really so different though? Threatening to 
launch a bidding contest with a supplier surely has some impact 
on behavior? I am not sure I really agree with your point.”
“Let me explain it more carefully,” said Laura. “It’s a bit subtle. 
Sure, category sourcing and SRM need to be complementary. 
The sourcing levers a company chooses to use have a big impact 
on supplier behavior. Your example of a tender is perfectly 
valid. Suppose we have an Integrate supplier. We have a very 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
137
close relationship with the company that we gain competitive 
advantage from. We then decide to threaten a tender or create a 
contractual dispute that we bring the lawyers in over. It’s bound 
to affect the relationship if we do these things. And, we have to 
think about that when we choose our sourcing levers. This does 
not mean we won’t get aggressive if we have to, by the way, but 
we think about the wider impacts if we do need to. The key point 
remains, though, that category sourcing is about how I choose 
to buy goods and services and SRM is about how I drive desired 
supplier behavior.”
“I see that,” said Elisabeth.
“Third, we have made a corporate decision that SRM is the right 
thing to do. The success of SRM at Heartland has therefore 
never been measured in cost terms. Our focus has been much 
more holistic—on innovation, risk reduction, and revenue 
enhancement. We have resisted the urge to micromeasure the 
impact of our activities.”
“That must have been quite hard to pull off,” commented 
Elisabeth. “The need for business cases is a refrain that one 
constantly hears.”
“We have stuck to our approach. Thomas strongly drove, and 
still does drive, the vision. He has given us top cover to focus 
on this. It’s a bit like sustainability—you are, in my view, either 
committed to it or not. To subject every aspect of it to a micro-
financial-business case is to miss the point and will ultimately 
be self-defeating. We have very much taken that approach to 
SRM.”
“That is very inspiring,” said Elisabeth.
“The fourth point is consistent with our strategic mindset for 
SRM. We have driven our approach to supplier interactions top-
down from a corporation-wide perspective. Many people make 
the mistake of driving segmentation entirely via categories. 
With this approach, different parts of the business, or worse still, 
procurement category managers, nominate ‘strategic suppliers.’ 
The problem is that everyone wants to feel they have some 
strategic suppliers. So, you get suppliers that, for our business, 
could never lead to real innovation or competitive advantage 
being nominated as strategic. I have heard of facilities’ suppliers 
being labeled as ‘strategic’ because they are big. For us, they are 
Harvest, and certainly not Integrate.”
“I can see the problem,” said Elisabeth.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 | Putting Supplier Interaction Models to Work
138
“It stems very often from failing to distinguish between category 
sourcing and SRM, as we already discussed. Instead, we drive 
our resource allocation and the effort that we devote to particular 
suppliers entirely top-down from our framework. So, we devote 
most attention to the Critical Cluster for positive reasons and to 
the Problem Children for negative ones. We put far less attention 
into the Ordinaries.”
“Is it really so special to prioritize in this way?”
“Most organizations prioritize in a much less top-down way,” 
Laura explained. “They tend to drive resource allocation and 
effort from categories and size of spending rather than from a true 
perspective of performance and value. The resource prioritization 
is not just about how we allocate procurement people. We have 
found that the biggest benefit is how we allocate management 
time and decision making time. It’s a mindset thing. For example, 
we found that one of the suppliers we now rate as Harvest had 
an account team of 12 people and they were involved in an 
executive-level meeting every couple of days. They are a good-
performing supplier, but this was completely inappropriate. On 
the other hand, we now consciously devote far-more executive-
management time to organizations such as Product Maniacs 
now. We have completely changed the way we think about the 
priority we give to different supplier relationships.”
Elisabeth sensed that Laura was really very excited by what had 
been done. “It’s a really inspiring story,” she said. “I am very 
impressed. Is there anything else you would like to highlight? ”
“Well,” said Laura. “The fifth point is that we treat this as a 
dynamic thing. That has enabled us to focus on giving suppliers 
consistent, aligned, and aspirational messages. That is something 
we are still learning, I would say. It only comes with experience. 
Suppliers can change position. Performance can ebb and flow.”
“Can you explain?”
“Well, let me start with performance. We do not want suppliers 
becoming complacent. To avoid this, we took a decision in the 
past year to force-rank every supplier in performance from an 
overall Heartland perspective, irrespective of category.”
“That must have been quite a challenge.”
“Indeed,” said Laura, “it was. But, we stuck to it. It forced some 
challenging internal conversations. Initially, we got too hooked 
up on small differences between suppliers that were all broadly 
in the middle of the bell curve anyway. That was not so helpful. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
139
Then we realized it would be much more useful to focus on 
understanding who the bottom 10 percent of performers were 
and who the top performers were. For the bottom performers, it 
has forced tough internal conversations on whether we should 
replace them. It has also meant we have been giving some of the 
suppliers very aspirational messages to improve. This has been 
particularly the case where a supplier is performing poorly but is 
potentially quite valuable for us. In such a case, replacing them 
is far less of an option. There are already encouraging signs of 
improvement among some of them.”
Elisabeth nodded in understanding. Laura went on. “We are just 
about ready now to refresh the ranking work. We learned a lot 
the first time around. It will be more focused this time and we 
will be even sharper on delivering the right messages.”
“What about strategic potential?” asked Elisabeth. “Is that dynamic 
too?”
“Much less so,” Laura said. “It’s much harder for strategic 
potential to change over time, because it is governed by the 
specifics of a supplier’s business. But it can occasionally change 
as well, of course.”
“How so?”
“Well, there is an example of an Influence supplier that we are  
reclassifying as Integrate. It is Caledonian Packaging, 
headquartered in Edinburgh. The level of cooperation we are 
achieving and the access we are now getting to its future product 
pipeline is really quite breathtaking. We are coming up with 
some great stuff together. So, that is—”
Emma, who had been largely silent up to now, interrupted. 
“Could you treat that as off the record, Elisabeth? I would prefer 
you did not publish it.”
“I understand,” said Elisabeth. “You have all been very open.  
I respect your need for confidentiality.”
Laura blushed slightly. “Yes, thank you. We are not quite ready 
to communicate this with Caledonian yet, either. We have been 
hinting at the reclassification for a while.”
“Yes,” said Thomas. “My good friend Calum Drummond is 
salivating to get that designation. I want to make him sweat just 
a little longer before we finalize it!” They all smiled and Laura 
stopped blushing.

“The fact that such a respected CEO pays such attention to how 
you classify his business really brings home to me how powerful 
this is,” said Elisabeth. She noticed the time and that the two 
hours scheduled for the session were nearly over. It felt like a 
natural endpoint anyway. “On that note, thank you very much 
for such an interesting morning.”
She exchanged her goodbyes and left for the airport. That 
afternoon, Elisabeth boarded her flight back to Munich. As the 
dinner service started, she reviewed her notes and captured five 
key success factors for SRM that she would use in her article.
Key Factors
Let’s look at the Five Key Success Factors that Elisabeth captured:
1.	 Never lose sight that SRM is about driving desired 
supplier behavior based on the appropriate interac-
tion model. Process, governance, and score cards are 
purely means to support that end.
2.	 SRM is complementary with but distinct from cat-
egory sourcing. Category sourcing is about how 
you buy things, not about how you drive supplier 
behavior.
3.	 Make a strategic decision to implement SRM because 
it is the right thing to do and will deliver competitive 
advantage. Resist the temptation to micromeasure 
benefits.
4.	 Drive the segmentation of suppliers and prioritiza-
tion of resources across the organization. Resist the 
urge to segment category by category or to allow 
category leaders to “vote” on supplier classification.
5.	 Treat the interaction models as dynamic: Rank suppli-
ers, make tough decisions, and give aspirational mes-
sages. Do not allow suppliers or yourself to become 
complacent with the status quo.
Bring SRM to Life
In this chapter, we talked about how to bring SRM to life. To do this, 
you need to treat the interaction models as dynamic by recognizing that 
changes occur over time. Use the framework to drive desirable change 
by giving suppliers consistent and aspirational messages. Be prepared to 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
141
make the difficult decisions that are needed when less desirable changes 
happen. Make sure that the governance structure is aligned to the interac-
tion models, that relationship owners are in place, and that communica-
tion to suppliers is consistent. By these means, you will help suppliers to 
help you in the most effective way.
We then went on to discuss the very clear distinction between SRM and 
category management. The former is about leveraging a company’s size 
and driving desired supplier behavior. The latter is about developing and 
executing the right strategies for sourcing goods and services—for which 
the standard tool is the Purchasing Chessboard.
Finally, we discussed how to get started, create momentum, and, impor-
tantly, make SRM sustainable. We illustrated this by catching up with our 
friends at Heartland as they looked back and discussed what they have 
done to put SRM to work.
The key element that we have not discussed so far is the role of IT in SRM. 
In the next chapter, we turn our attention to this topic.
www.it-ebooks.info

The Role of IT 
in TrueSRM
In our experience, companies often overfocus on elaborate IT tools that 
are not needed and consume considerable investment resources and 
management time to implement. It is crucial to consider the basic objec-
tives of an IT implementation before going down that path. The IT tools 
are there to support the business needs and supplier relationship man-
agement. They are not an end in themselves and should not be seen as 
a substitute for face-to-face and other personal dialogue both with the 
supplier and internally.
In our experience, there are three key requirements that IT tools need to 
enable for TrueSRM: 
Tracking supplier performance/compliance
• 
Enabling internal collaboration
• 
Enabling external collaboration
• 
These tools need to be deployed in a usable format, with the key elements 
integrated so that data does not need to be entered multiple times and to 
enable users to have a common view of the true situation. The organization 
also needs the discipline to use the tools properly. This is the adoption 
challenge. It tends to be the most significant issue to overcome.
We will now address each of these elements in turn.

Tracking Supplier Performance/Compliance
Many organizations have basic supplier score cards in place that are used 
to report performance against key metrics such as contract/Service Level 
Agreement (SLA) compliance, delivery performance, value-added perfor-
mance beyond the contract, and so forth. Much of this data is neces-
sarily collected manually, and some via feeds from operational systems 
where available. These score cards are often created at the category-/ 
business-function level, and then ongoing “production” is delegated to a 
back-office function that fills in the paperwork. Off-the-shelf spreadsheet 
or database packages are often used as the enabling tool. To a point, this 
is an effective reporting solution.
These score card solutions are often combined, or augmented with addi-
tional solutions that enable organizations to record and ensure supplier 
agreement to key policies. The precise need for these varies by industry 
and geography, but they are increasingly necessary to manage risk.
Recording suppliers’ performance and compliance is really a “given.” Most 
organizations have an approach in place. A more valuable SRM solution 
goes beyond point reporting and provides a more integrated capability 
across the organization. This feeds relevant performance/compliance 
information such as supplier segment, supplier overall performance, rel-
evant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and corresponding trend infor-
mation into other business applications, where users deal with suppliers. 
For example, supplier performance data is highly valuable for users of 
e-procurement systems. Here, a user should see not only the source, 
price, availability, and lead time for a catalog item but also performance-
related information for the supplier. In particular, the user should be 
able to see whether there are alternatives. In e-Sourcing, a category  
manager/buyer needs to have ready access to performance and compli-
ance information, too, as part of the initial prescreening and also for award 
analysis. If a category-management solution is in place, performance details 
and trends concerning segmentation and performance of all suppliers in a 
category should also be visible.
Internal Collaboration
On the customer side, the idea has been around for a long time that a lot 
of value can be generated if the sales agent talking to a particular customer 
has a comprehensive “customer history” at hand. When a customer dials 
into the call center of his insurance company, the agent typically sees 
information about all of his contracts, his value, his accuracy in on-time 
payment, his risk score, his recent support calls, e-mails, and letters. Such 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
145
information helps the agent adjust the communication according to the 
customer’s status. This has spawned the many forms of customer relation-
ship management software.
The functionality to do the same thing in the same way is available on the 
supplier side, but most organizations have been much slower to put it 
in place. Given the benefits of ensuring a joined-up approach from deal-
ing with suppliers, the value of doing so is immense. Why not introduce 
something like this on the supplier side more systematically?
In fact, the information that is immediately available for managing suppliers 
is often limited to spending, order fulfillment, and score card data. There 
are often significant challenges in going beyond this. For example: 
Procurement often lacks permission to see sales data 
• 
if the supplier is also an important customer.
It sometimes takes weeks of research and dozens of 
• 
phone calls to stakeholders across multiple sites and 
business units to get a glimpse of who is talking with 
a particular supplier about what.
People are reluctant to log “buy-side” interactions in 
• 
the same way that is usually a given on the “sell” side.
In our view, the internal-collaboration portion of an SRM solution needs 
to encompass the following elements:
• 
Spending: “What are we spending with this supplier? 
What for? Who is buying? What important trends or 
changes are we seeing?”
• 
Contracts: “What contracts do we have in place with 
this supplier? When do they expire?”
• 
Contract compliance: “How many issues have been 
reported where the supplier did not comply with 
the agreed-upon contract? How severe were these 
incidents?”
• 
Sourcing activities: “In what sourcing initiatives was the 
supplier involved? With what success? In case of los-
ing in an initiative, what were the reasons?”
• 
Risk, safety, and sustainability compliance: “Has the sup-
plier confirmed compliance with all policies? Have 
there been any breaches? Does the organization 
meet all regulatory requirements?
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9 | The Role of IT in TrueSRM
146
• 
Supplier contact register: “Who do we know on the 
supplier side? What do we know about these people? 
What are their perspectives/agendas?”
• 
Internal contact register: “Who knows this supplier? 
What kind of relationship is this person having with 
the supplier? When should one involve her?”
• 
Meeting calendar with meeting minutes repository:  “Who 
has met/is meeting whom from the supplier? What 
have they been talking about? What has been the 
outcome?”
• 
Documents: “What are the latest documents we 
received from this supplier (e.g., company presenta-
tions, catalogs, specifications, rate cards)?
• 
Wiki: “What other bits and pieces of information 
about the supplier has someone from our company 
picked up that he would like to share with others in 
the most pragmatic and easy way?”
• 
Projects and tasks: “What projects and tasks are cur-
rently underway with this supplier? Who from our 
side and who from the supplier’s side is involved? 
What is the status? Where are the issues others 
should know about? What corresponding documents 
are of potential relevance for others?”
The software functionality to process all this information exists and is 
available in most organizations. The will, drive, and discipline to make it 
happen exist less frequently.
Note
■
■
  There is no reason you can’t have the kind of information about suppliers that you 
no doubt compile about customers. Having a system to collect useful data can be immensely 
valuable, yet not many organizations have one. This is therefore an easy way to gain a 
competitive advantage.
Supplier Collaboration
Many organizations today have some form of supplier portal. This opens 
some functionality of internal collaboration to suppliers. Often, the portal 
is simply set up to allow suppliers to maintain registration, contact, and 
payment data. Allowing them to contribute actively and update additional 
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
147
information, as well as jointly execute projects and tasks, is a key extra 
step. In our view, the supplier portal portion of an SRM solution needs to 
encompass the following elements as a minimum:
• 
Performance visibility: In areas where a company wants 
to establish a truly collaborative relationship, it could 
share all ratings and conclusions with suppliers. 
Buyers often hesitate to share positive performance 
feedback in order not to strengthen the negotiation 
position of a supplier. We believe that the benefits of 
positive feedback usually far outweigh the risks.
• 
Issue visibility, commenting, and resolution: Even if a buyer 
does not want to share all performance information 
with a certain supplier, everyone benefits from giv-
ing a supplier immediate feedback on specific issues 
through e-mail notifications and alerts in the supplier 
portal. Even better solutions allow a supplier to com-
ment on such issues. Sometimes, an issue (like late 
delivery) might have been caused by forces outside of 
the supplier’s control and should therefore not overly 
damage its performance rating. If the collaboration 
solution supports task management, corresponding 
tasks for issue resolution can be set up with respon-
sibilities and deadlines for improved resolution moni-
toring. This, then, supports the traditional approaches 
of direct contact and conversation to resolve issues. 
It should not be a substitute for these things.
• 
Reverse feedback: In the interest of collaborative 
improvement in a relationship, it is a good idea to 
allow your suppliers to provide feedback about your 
performance. Technically, this requires the setup of 
corresponding surveys, permissions, and linking to 
the supplier portal. Giving the supplier the ability to 
provide this information via a portal is a useful supple-
ment to the typical one-off, anonymous ­360-degree 
surveys that organizations often put in place. Of 
course, the propensity of suppliers to give open and 
honest feedback without anonymity is an interesting 
test of relationship strength.
It is also possible to extend the scope of the portal beyond these mini-
mum elements to include facilities for joint innovation. These would allow 
the supplier to submit innovative ideas that could be discussed/approved. 
You’d then follow a stage-gate process for tracking implementation. Such 
an approach can be a useful addition. However, we cannot stress enough 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9 | The Role of IT in TrueSRM
148
that IT tools do not produce innovation. True innovation typically requires 
effective dialogue with the supplier, a commitment to cocreation, and the 
ability to make decisions. In the absence of such a process, way-too-many 
potential innovations just get ignored.
Clearly, all external collaboration via systems has technical challenges. As 
soon as a company opens certain doors in the firewall, substantial IT 
security implications require expert attention. Permission management in 
internal collaboration is in many companies already challenging enough, as 
the more strategic a relationship with a supplier gets, the more sensitive 
it becomes. The biggest challenge comes from an inability of most systems 
to deal with a multidimensional permission matrix. Most systems are still  
very transaction oriented. A user either has permission to access a  
transaction or not. The more comprehensively we do SRM, the more it 
becomes necessary to define and administer permissions holistically. With 
external participants, the permission management becomes even more 
challenging. One way to sidestep these issues is to manage collaboration 
in a separately hosted “clean room” environment that is outside the fire-
walls of both the customer and the supplier. Data is kept safe within the 
clean room and the issues of allowing third parties direct system access 
are avoided.
Tip
■
■
  Use a virtual “clean room” to manage collaboration with suppliers. You can supply the 
relevant data there without offering full access to your IT systems.
Usability and Adoption
If you build a system with all the components just outlined, you will have 
built a great repository of information, easily accessible to everyone (with 
corresponding permissions, of course). An ideal SRM solution not only 
collects information from various other systems but also provides out-
bound interfaces, making essential SRM-related information available to 
other systems. In times where most business applications have become 
browser enabled, it just takes a little imagination to envision a workplace  
where a user, whenever she sees supplier-related information on her 
screen, can hover over the supplier name and see a display of the essen-
tials about this supplier (e.g., segment, alerts, and so forth) along with a 
link to a more detailed dashboard if needed.
www.it-ebooks.info

Supplier Relationship Management
149
The Adoption Challenge
Now, we need to get users to actually use the SRM solution. Far too many 
IT solutions suffer from poor adoption. This is often for a simple reason: 
the users do not see the benefits. In our view, a useful SRM solution should 
encompass the following usability elements to support adoption:
• 
Maximum user configurability: All our attempts to col-
lect and display as much information about a sup-
plier as possible can easily lead to a situation where 
we show way-too-much information to a user, which 
might overwhelm and cause confusion. An ideal solu-
tion comes in a very lightweight form in the beginning 
but then allows the user to select the elements of 
interest that he wants to pop up next time automati-
cally. Similar to the earlier-mentioned difficulties with 
multidimensional permission management that most 
systems today still have, the same applies with the 
requirements for ideal information configurability. It 
is more than likely that a category manager would 
like to see much more detail about one or two key 
suppliers instantly, a little less for some others and 
just some lightweight information about the rest. This 
triage approach is essential to get user buy in.
• 
Proactive alerting: How many reports do you have 
access to? And how many do you actually look at 
daily, weekly, or at least monthly? It is too common an 
occurrence that having great information in a system 
does not necessarily mean it finds its way to the user 
who should be aware of it. An ideal SRM solution 
allows the admin as well as the user to define flexibly 
configurable alerts that shoot an e-mail to selected 
user(s) under certain conditions (e.g., “Supplier XYZ’s 
performance trend is negative”). The configurability 
again needs to be multidimensional.
• 
Visual analytics: Not only do long lists of data easily 
create an information overload, they also often make 
it difficult to see the forest for the trees. Advanced 
visual analytics is not about creating nice-looking 
graphics but all about transforming data in a way that 
makes it easier to recognize the meaning or identify 
areas that should get closer attention.

Chapter 9 | The Role of IT in TrueSRM

• 
Personal information integration: Let’s face it: if you are 
a supplier manager, you probably have tons of infor-
mation on your hard disk/network drive and in your 
e-mail. Getting additional information from others? 
Great! Sharing your own information? Extra effort! 
Even with sophisticated incentives and penalties, it is 
hard to overcome this natural reluctance to spend 
time on something that only benefits you personally 
in a limited way. Sure, the organization benefits, but 
the individual person is not getting rewarded. This 
is why we believe a lot of success is dependent on 
how easy we make it for people to share informa-
tion. Studies show that average office workers spend  
80 percent of their daily IT time working with their 
own personal information (e-mail, address book, cal-
endar, chat). If you want the user to share, for example, 
an attachment just received from a strategic supplier, 
you should not expect her to download it, then open 
a browser, then find the right site for this supplier, and 
then upload the file and provide contextual informa-
tion. Instead, you’d enable smart integration with the 
user’s personal information by allowing her to “drag 
and drop” this attachment right into the repository.
• 
Active adoption management: Many systems, if they are 
not essential for daily operations, die a slow but cer-
tain death. We just explained a couple of reasons for 
this, but there is one more, which has nothing to do 
with the system itself but with the way it gets rolled 
out into the organization, how its usage is monitored, 
whether and how frequently news and success sto-
ries get communicated, and to what extent users get 
the right level of support they need.
Note

  You have to work to get a new IT solution adopted. It won’t happen on its own. Worse, 
if it’s the kind of thing people rarely go into, it will die an early death.
We have now discussed the key IT requirements for TrueSRM to enable 
performance and compliance tracking as well as to support both internal 
and external collaboration. The challenges are not technical ones. They 
are more to do with having the will to put the systems in place and then

to use them rigorously. Much of the necessary functionality and disciplines 
mirror what your company already probably does on the “sell” side with 
its customers through active customer relationship management (CRM) 
systems. It is often beneficial to make the case for following the necessary 
disciplines in these terms by stressing the symmetry between the disci-
plines needed for good CRM and good supplier management.
It is now time to return to the story at Heartland. You will recall that the 
group has just been interviewed by a well-known journalist who is trying 
to identify the reasons for their great success. The attentive reader will 
have noticed that IT systems were not on the list of key success factors 
that the journalist captured. Let’s now catch up with Laura and Thomas to 
see what role, if any, IT has played in the story.
Heartland Contemplates IT’s  
Contribution to SRM
A short time after the magazine interview, Thomas was in his 
office late one afternoon. Laura walked in to debrief him quickly 
on a meeting that had taken place that day with Product Maniacs, 
the company’s new supplier. It had suggested a way to put one of 
the core Heartland brands up in lights legally and simultaneously 
on the Empire State Building, the Shard in London, the Eiffel 
Tower, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
However, Thomas was preoccupied. He asked, “Laura, are 
you aware of this discussion to overhaul our entire Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) infrastructure? There is a suggestion 
that we need to spend tens of millions of dollars that I am sure 
will become hundreds of millions. There seems to be no real 
business case for doing this, though, other than a claim that we 
will get better management information on external spending 
and make our back-office processes more efficient. Oh, and 
there is also a claim that it will better enable our activities with 
suppliers.” He flipped to the back page of the document that was 
on his desk and then said, “They are claiming a business case. It 
will all be justified by suppliers giving us savings as a result of 
all this IT!”
“I had heard some discussion,” said Laura, “but I have not seen 
that document. I’m surprised I never got it or had a chance to 
comment.”

“It’s labelled preliminary,” Thomas told her, as he handed it 
over. “It came from IT. I probably shouldn’t have it yet,” he 
commented with a smile. “Let’s just say that someone handed 
it to me. I like to know what is being discussed before it goes 
anywhere. Do you agree with this approach? Will it help us to 
continue to deliver SRM?”
“We don’t need it,” Laura answered. “There might be other 
reasons to overhaul the ERP, although I am not sure I know what 
they are, but I am not pushing for it. Most of the things we need 
to do, we are fine with.”
“Yes, we have never really discussed IT as a big part of SRM,” 
suggested Thomas.
“Well,” said Laura, “if I think purely about our IT needs for 
supplier management rather than for category management, 
compliance, and transactions processing, then what we 
really require are tools that enable three things: performance 
measurement, internal collaboration, and external collaboration. 
We then just need to be able to use them and make sure that 
people are disciplined to do so.”
Thomas turned his chair more fully toward her but said 
nothing.
Laura continued. “For performance measurement, we have put 
in place simple score cards for each significant supplier. The 
score cards are maintained by the relevant supplier lead within 
Procurement. They are then filed on a simple wiki site. It’s basic 
IT technology, but they are fit for our purpose. We have some 
feeds to capture online data such as missed deliveries for direct 
suppliers, but most of the information is maintained by people 
in the business. It’s not captured in the systems anyway so there 
is little alternative available. In any event, we use the process 
of populating the scorecards to trigger conversations about  
performance, which are used as input for our rankings. It’s not 
fully automated, nor could it ever be. It works and is fit for 
purpose. We also encourage an approach based on the 80–20 
rule, which simplifies things too.”
“The 80–20 rule always worries some of our colleagues,” 
said Thomas. “They think it means we are ignoring critical 
incidents.”
“You know we don’t do that, Thomas. What I mean is that we do 
not try to split hairs over relative supplier performance. It’s a bit 
like employee performance in so many ways. I am not interested

if a supplier’s performance is 53rd percentile vs. 54th percentile. 
I am interested if a supplier is consistently in the top 20 percent, 
the middle 60 percent, or the bottom 20 percent. Our approach 
to measurement enables us to make that level of differentiation. 
Investing in doing more is not going to be helpful and will just 
be a waste of money.”
“So, our current approach is good enough, then?” Thomas 
inquired.
“Yes. We then make sure that the score card information is 
available to key people internally, of course. You already have 
access to it on your executive dashboard.”
“I sure do. I even look at it before meetings,” he grinned.
“To enable that internal collaboration and data access, we have 
just deployed the CRM tool that our sales force uses to keep 
tabs on customer contacts, relationships, and meetings. The key 
issue is not the system functionality. The ability to log contacts 
with suppliers and so forth is fairly straightforward. Sharing the 
data is also easy. The challenge is getting people (especially 
executives) to populate the information.”
“I know,” said Thomas. He laughed. “By the way, who is making 
sure the notes from that Product Maniacs meeting today get on 
there?”
“I have found that the best way to get people to do it is to 
ask what’s the best thing to do after a customer meeting. Of 
course, they all agree that updating CRM and circulating notes 
is crucial. They all agree, too, that meeting a customer without 
being briefed is not smart. So, why is it any different if we are 
meeting a key supplier?”
“People get that logic. I know,” agreed Thomas.
“Exactly,” said Laura. “We then have the supplier portal, of 
course. That provides the basic functionality for suppliers to 
update core data with us and confirm policy compliance. It also 
provides a means to have structured dialogue on issues. I am 
going to extend it to include conversations on supplier-driven 
innovations. I am a little wary, though, of it just becoming an 
easy mechanical tool. You know what can happen. The supplier 
can dream up numerous things, and then just stick them on 
the portal. Suppliers may feel that they have to give us large 
numbers of ideas with no obvious reference to their quality 
and practicality. We for our part may just get swamped with all 
these ideas. That would not be very helpful. We are still working

through how to make sure that any additions here support the 
way we drive supplier innovation rather than becoming a pure 
self-serving ‘numbers’ process.”
“The key thing is the innovations we actually implement and 
the benefit we get,” suggested Thomas, “not what gets logged 
on the system.”
“Absolutely,” agreed Laura. “We are seeing major innovations 
already, of course, which surface through collaboration with the 
right suppliers.”
“So, there is very little we need to do with the SRM systems?” 
asked Thomas.
“I think so,” said Laura. “A bit of evolutionary enhancement 
will be good. But you don’t need to overhaul the whole ERP 
system. I certainly will not be prepared to sign up for more 
supplier savings from doing that in any case!”
You Can Build It
As the Heartland story showed, a useful SRM solution:
1.	 Is based on a state-of-the-art IT architecture for scal-
ability and ease of administration
2.	 Collects and provides all relevant data and comes 
with appropriate measures to correct, complete, and 
enrich otherwise-insufficient data
3.	 Provides information to all users in the easiest possi-
ble way (ideally without the need for users to access 
multiple keys on the keyboard and without multiple 
system clicks)
4.	 Leverages advanced statistics to allow users to derive 
business intelligence beyond the obvious
5.	 Automates low-value-add tasks for improved adoption
6.	 Stipulates collaboration (document sharing, wiki, chat, 
and so on) and best-practice sharing in the form of 
templates across the organization and for use with 
suppliers
7.	 Avoids information overload, leveraging advanced 
visual analytics, and push reporting

Does such an SRM solution already exist? Not that we are aware of. At 
least, not in a way that is integrated across different applications with 
shared data and end-to-end functionality. SRM system implementations 
have often not advanced much beyond stand-alone point implementations 
of a contract database, performance score card, or portal for suppliers to 
register their details. There is a major opportunity for organizations to 
move beyond this basic state of play.
Is it possible to build it? Yes. Nothing described in this chapter is rocket 
science. The IT functionality is often available, and in fact many organiza-
tions are already deploying much of it for managing customer relation-
ships! The challenge has less to do with the basic functionality and more 
to do with the wherewithal to integrate the different point solutions that 
are often already in place, and then to drive usability and adoption.
Large IT Investments Are Unnecessary
In this chapter, we discussed how IT can support TrueSRM most effec-
tively major investment in systems is usually not necessary. Using existing 
functionalities in a disciplined way, while keeping sight of the overall objec-
tive, is the most effective approach.
In the next chapter, we turn back to that overall objective. We will look at 
what is “different” for a business that has implemented TrueSRM. For, the 
whole point of doing this is to be more successful as a business. We will 
take a look at how this is so. We will also catch up for a final time with 
the story at Heartland—and see how different its business becomes as a 
result of fully implementing TrueSRM.

The “Difference”  
You Get from 
TrueSRM
Companies introducing, applying, and living TrueSRM will undergo funda-
mental changes. These changes will be necessary to stay competitive in 
the market. Similar to the introduction of category management over the 
past two decades, TrueSRM will separate the leaders from the laggards. 
Done right, it will help companies to leverage suppliers and harness the 
energy that is out there in the supplier market. The changes associated 
with the introduction will be felt:
Within procurement
• 
Across functions
• 
Across hierarchy levels
• 
By suppliers
• 
By competitors
• 
Let’s look at each in turn.

Changes Felt Within Procurement
Procurement teams will have to understand the clear separation between 
category management and supplier relationship management once the 
changes are implemented. Perhaps this can best be achieved by first mak-
ing it crystal clear what exactly category management is. We have elabo-
rated on this in Chapter 8 and recommend The Purchasing Chessboard as 
a read for those who would like to dive deeper into this topic. Once cat-
egory management is clearly defined, the more challenging task of clarifying 
supplier relationship management can be approached. We are confident 
that this book encompasses the core elements and success factors of SRM, 
but, in most cases, companies will not have many of their own success 
stories to build upon when entering this territory.
Once the separation between category management and SRM is under-
stood, new roles and responsibilities have to be accepted. That will be 
uncomfortable to many. While in the current state, most category manag-
ers might assume that they are also managing the supplier relationship, 
TrueSRM will bundle the relationship management. For many procure-
ment team members, this will mean having to navigate in some kind of 
matrix with both category and relationship aspects being managed. Life 
will become more complicated than it is today.
The most probable, drastic change in Procurement will be the need to 
identify different priorities and employ different skill sets. By focusing 
attention on suppliers in the Critical Cluster, many tasks that appear to 
be “supplier management” today will be eliminated. Team members who 
currently perform these tasks will not necessarily be the ones with the 
right skills to work with suppliers in the Influence, Integrate, and Invest 
interaction models.
Changes Felt Across Functions
SRM is a cross-functional top-management task. One might have said the 
same thing about strategic sourcing and category management five years 
ago. The key difference is that while strategic sourcing and category man-
agement are cross-functional and procurement led, SRM is cross-functional 
as well but might be led by functions outside of procurement.
Let’s take a more detailed look at which function is leading SRM. For 
the Harvest, Improve, Sustain, Mitigate, and Develop supplier interaction 
models, the distribution of roles will not be too different from strategic 
sourcing and category management. Procurement’s role will be to facili-
tate quarterly reviews with suppliers and to coach suppliers in providing 
meaningful and consistent progress reports. Other functions will support 
this process, but Procurement will lead the way.
www.it-ebooks.info

159
Supplier Relationship Management
For the Bail Out interaction model, it is hard to make a generalization on 
the distribution of roles. Depending on the nature of the problem with 
the Bail Out supplier, a specific task force will be put in place. The leader 
of the task force will ideally be recruited from the function or discipline 
that has the critical competence to fix the problem. So, if the supplier has 
a manufacturing issue, the leader of the effort would come from internal 
manufacturing, or if the supplier has a financial issue, corporate finance 
would take the lead.
Remember that a key mission of TrueSRM is to focus attention on those 
few suppliers that really matter in the long run. Relationships to suppliers 
that fall into this category would be managed with the Influence, Invest, 
and Integrate interaction models. For these interaction models, specific 
governance models would be put in place and Procurement would typi-
cally be more a contributor than a leader in this context.
Changes Felt Across Hierarchy Levels
Earlier we stated that SRM is a cross-functional top management task. 
In line with the cross-functional discussion, top management is unlikely 
to get involved in decisions regarding suppliers in the Harvest, Improve, 
Sustain, Mitigate, and Develop supplier interaction models. If suppliers in 
these interaction models happen to be significant suppliers in terms of the 
amount of business transacted, then top management might occasionally 
join quarterly review meetings to emphasize messages that are prepared 
by the Procurement-led cross-functional teams. However, the intensity of 
the interaction will be significantly lower than for suppliers in the Critical 
Cluster, irrespective of the amount of business transacted.
Suppliers in the Bail Out interaction model will typically be highly relevant 
for top management, and, very often, top management might have put the 
supplier into that interaction model. Since the Bail Out task forces need 
to operate at high speed and far beyond the usual boundaries of doing 
business, top management will be key for opening doors.
The most regular top management involvement is likely to be seen in the 
Influence, Invest, and Integrate interaction models. In many companies, the 
key challenge will be to connect ongoing top management activities to the 
SRM efforts. A serious TrueSRM program will limit the freedom of top 
management to reach out to their counterparts at suppliers at will.
Note

  If you are serious about implementing TrueSRM, senior executives will no longer 
have the freedom to contact suppliers whenever they want without serious internal alignment 
being achieved first.

Changes Felt By Suppliers
Suppliers should generally appreciate their customers embracing TrueSRM, 
as it brings clarity into the overall relationship. For suppliers in the Harvest, 
Improve, Sustain, Mitigate, and Develop interaction models, the relation-
ship will be transactional. There will be clear expectations regarding what 
needs to be done by the next quarterly milestone review, and good per-
formance will be rewarded. At the same time, the supplier will not need 
to dedicate resources to bringing the relationship to a place it will never 
go—because there is mutual clarity on what the relationship really is.
Suppliers in the Bail Out interaction model will receive the attention 
they deserve. What might have resulted in finger pointing in the past is 
replaced by a swift corrective intervention by the customer’s task force. 
A smart supplier will fully cooperate with the task force, as ultimately it 
can only win and learn from it.
Suppliers in Influence, Invest, and Integrate will first need to understand 
the unique position they have been assigned. They will have the opportu-
nity to grow, make game-changing moves, and build winning ecosystems. 
In the end, the customer is competing for mind share, and, since this is a 
limited resource, it will always be an investment and account management 
decision by the supplier whether or not to fully engage. What should 
be clear to everybody involved is that the Integrate supplier interaction 
model, especially, can only work if both parties are fully engaged. A supplier 
that is not ready should communicate this proactively to avoid wasting its 
customer’s time and resources.
Changes Felt by Competitors
Competitors of a company like Heartland Consolidated Industries that 
fully embrace TrueSRM will struggle to understand what hit them. They 
will wonder what Heartland did to become so much more competitive:
Did they hire a new breed of managers?
• 
Did they put some new type of innovation process 
• 
in place?
Is it a different kind of incentive system for internal 
• 
people?
Are they getting some form of external help, maybe 
• 
from a consulting firm?
www.it-ebooks.info

161
Supplier Relationship Management
Is it the new CEO who brought some magic tricks 
• 
from his former employer?
Is there something we did wrong to fall out of favor 
• 
with our key suppliers?
As readers of this book, you know the answer. By introducing TrueSRM, 
Heartland has taken the game to an entirely new level. Managing the rela-
tionship with thousands of suppliers has always been a losing proposition. 
What Heartland did right was putting suppliers into the right buckets and 
defining clearly differentiated approaches for each bucket. This allowed 
Heartland to deprioritize suppliers that are useful but don’t make a differ-
ence in the grand scheme of things. With this, Heartland freed up manage-
ment capacity to focus on those few suppliers that really matter to them. 
Once those select-few suppliers recognized this, Heartland got a lot more 
out of them than any of Heartland’s competitors. This, in turn, sparked a 
virtuous cycle that made Heartland the number-one place for any ambi-
tious supplier to go to because working with the company got it the best 
chance at growing fast and profitably.
With this, let us conclude by looking at an article written by Elisabeth 
Huttich two years after her first interview with Thomas Sutter and Laura 
Braida. It was published in the Global Economy as a “briefing” piece.
Heartland’s Secret Sauce
How a Dull Consumer Goods Company Reinvented Itself to 
Become the Darling of the Stock Market . . . and Others.
By Elisabeth Huttich
The Star of Fort Wayne
Taxi drivers are often a reliable indicator for the mood in a 
community. So when your correspondent arrived at Fort Wayne’s 
cozy little airport, she did not head for the rental-car booths but 
got into one of the very few cabs available. After looking quickly 
at me through the rearview mirror, the driver asked, “Are you 
coming here to work for Heartland?” Over the next 20 minutes, 
he talked about how much Fort Wayne had changed over the 
past years thanks to the company.
First, there were all these smart kids moving to Fort Wayne to 
work for Heartland. He called them the Silicon Valley crowd. 
Obviously, Heartland must pay them very well, for what other 
reason would they move from California to Indiana? Second,

lots of companies were opening up offices in Fort Wayne and 
they surely must have something to do with Heartland. He had 
overheard their executives discussing contracts with Heartland 
in his cab on their way to and from the airport. Then there was a 
lot of construction work going on, most notably on Heartland’s 
new campus. That was very good for some of his buddies who 
were in the industry. And finally, there were the prices of houses. 
His own house, which he had inherited from his grandparents, 
had more than tripled in value over the past five years. He could 
sell it for a handsome amount, but then all the other houses seem 
to have gotten more expensive too, so he wondered whether that 
would be a good idea.
How did Heartland transform not only Fort Wayne, Indiana, but 
also itself? How is it that Fort Wayne is mentioned in business 
dailies more often than Cupertino, Mountain View, or Menlo 
Park? How did a formerly dull food-products company that was 
better known for causing obesity than excitement become the 
most desired employer for business school graduates?
Many attempts have been made at answering these questions 
and the latest count yields eight books on the topic. Emma 
Jenkins, Heartland’s notoriously tight-lipped spokesperson, has 
dismissed all of those books as inaccurate. As a correspondent, 
I have been on the Heartland story for more than two years after 
conducting an interview with Thomas Sutter, Heartland’s CEO, 
and Laura Braida, then the company’s CPO, or chief procurement 
officer, and now its COO, or chief operations officer, after the 
recent departure of Rick Fiore. To date, this interview is still 
regarded by many as giving the most relevant clues on what 
makes Heartland tick.
Heartland’s executives are not eager to share their secret sauce 
with the rest of the world. Both Sutter and Braida regularly give 
interviews, but they are very skillful at avoiding giving insights 
into how they are running the company. Heartland’s wider 
executive team does not talk to media, not even off the record. 
This left me to conduct my research for this article largely based 
on interviews with former executives and suppliers.
Even Suppliers Rave About Heartland
Usually, suppliers are very reluctant to talk about their customers 
publicly. When they talk off the record, the tone is usually 
critical. Heartland is different. One of the suppliers known to 
www.it-ebooks.info

163
Supplier Relationship Management
work very closely with the company is Caledonian Packaging, 
the global-packaging giant headquartered in Edinburgh. Calum 
Drummond, Caledonian’s CEO, is a towering and imposing man 
who has hardly given any interviews in his 15 years of leading 
the company, yet he was willing to talk about the relationship 
with Heartland in general and Thomas Sutter specifically.
Caledonian Packaging is a family-owned business that was 
founded by Drummond’s great-grand-uncle in the early 20th 
century. The executive explained that in his view, unlike 
many publicly listed companies, Caledonian has always taken 
an extremely long-term perspective about every business 
relationship it entertains. For an average food product, the 
packaging makes up less than 5 percent of the overall product 
cost. And it is very difficult to replace the packaging because 
of the regulatory approvals required, such as with the FDA in 
America.
So, Caledonian’s approach typically is, in his words, “Simply to 
do a good job, provide flawless quality, and help our customers 
to achieve what they want. Over the past 20 years, this has mostly 
been about dealing with smaller lot sizes. Think yogurt. When 
I was a child, there were maybe 20 different brand and flavor 
combinations of yogurt in a grocery store. Today, it can easily 
be over a hundred in an average supermarket. We have had to 
become very efficient at making short production runs of yogurt 
lids in all kinds of colors and layouts.”
Drummond further explained that many of his big customers 
have hired armies of consultants and MBAs in procurement 
principally to negotiate much more advantageous commercial 
terms and squeeze his profit margins.
I asked him for his views on this. He felt it is OK and that it 
keeps Caledonian at the top of its game commercially. “But then 
you have to ask yourself, What does a consumer goods company 
get out of its packaging supplier? Is it just about nickeling and 
diming us, or is there more? A smart man might reckon that the 
packaging is what talks to the consumer at the point of sale. And 
this is what my friend Thomas Sutter instinctively understood. 
He could have done what all his competitors are doing and set 
his blood hounds on us. Laura Braida, who was leading their 
procurement, is pretty sharp. She, for sure, could have squeezed 
2 percent savings out of us, no doubt about that. But they went 
for the smart packaging innovation with us. And everybody now 
understands how to work with their packaging supplier.”

Chapter 10 | The “Difference”  You Get from TrueSRM
164
Drummond’s comments about Heartland were borne out by 
other off-the-record conversations with suppliers in the industry. 
They were reluctant to talk openly for fear of offending other 
customers who behave differently from Heartland.
Heartland Is a Business Transformed
With Sutter at its helm, Heartland has become nothing less than 
America’s career hotbed. Not only is the company the employer 
of choice for business school graduates, it has also become the 
prime target of headhunters. Companies from just about every 
industry want to replicate the Heartland success story by bringing 
the company’s people on board. The most famous Heartland 
alumnus is, of course, Rick Fiore, formerly Heartland’s COO, 
now CEO of Detroit Motors, America’s second-biggest maker 
of passenger cars and light trucks. Fiore’s family still lives in 
Fort Wayne, and he and Sutter are frequently seen together doing 
long runs on early Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Asked what they chat about during these runs, Fiore claims that 
Sutter is paying him back. “When Thomas joined Heartland 
from Autowerke, he knew nothing about consumer goods and I 
was his tutor. I believe Thomas is still grateful for that. So, when 
I was approached by Detroit Motors, Thomas spent a lot of time 
explaining the key success factors of a carmaker to me. He still 
knows a lot about the industry and I go to him to test ideas that 
I am pondering.”
Fiore is clearly proud of his close connection to Sutter. “What 
Thomas brought to Heartland was focus. Focus on what really 
matters.” Fiore explained that Sutter is very good at identifying 
winners and ignoring everything else. He says that, in essence, 
Heartland, under Sutter’s leadership, is all about a differentiated 
customer experience. This means that each of Heartland’s 
products or services needs to leave a lasting positive experience 
in the customer’s mind. And, in Fiore’s words: “That experience 
needs to be way beyond anything that Heartland’s competitors  
can offer.”
www.it-ebooks.info

165
Supplier Relationship Management
Suppliers Have Been the Crucial Ingredient
Most businesses claim to be able to offer a differentiated customer 
experience. What is interesting about Heartland is how it says 
it has done that. The point that Fiore stresses is that effective 
supplier management, or what he describes as “TrueSRM,” or 
more fully “True Supplier Relationship Management,” has been 
critical for achieving that differentiated customer experience.
This perspective is not just hype. The company’s success has 
come from a combination of the chief executive’s vision and 
effective supplier relationships. Fiore cites the second-generation 
frozen-food packaging as an example where innovation involved 
leveraging multiple networked supplier relationships. This now 
includes the use of semiconductors and LCDs as an integral 
part of the packaging to improve the safety of food handling 
by monitoring temperature. Heartland had already introduced 
packaging that changes color once it has been out of the freezer too 
long. This had been developed in cooperation with Caledonian. 
You might have thought that this would do the job. Not so for 
Heartland under Sutter. Fiore explained that Sutter “has this laser 
focus and thinks many steps ahead. He always warned us that 
competitors would soon come up with something comparable.” 
So, the CEO drove the creation of a tripartite relationship  
between Heartland, Caledonian, and a small Silicon Valley start-up  
to work time and again on more advanced solutions. This led 
to the development of yet another level of ice cream packaging 
that has a printed display telling you how many more minutes 
you can keep the ice cream outside of the freezer. This has been 
a great success for Heartland. Up to then, no one had thought 
that you could make semiconductors and LCD displays into a 
part of packaging by printing them cheaply. As we have reported 
before, Heartland’s competitors are suffering intensely. Their ice 
cream and frozen food are considered by many to be unsafe in 
light of this new packaging.
Will the Changes Last?
The question is whether these changes at Heartland are more 
than skin-deep. Will they outlast Sutter? Fiore thinks they will. 
He explained: “Of course Thomas cannot be everywhere at 
once, which is why he is building operating models that force 
people to focus.” He talked about the interface with suppliers. A 
company as big as Heartland will always have tens of thousands 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 | The “Difference”  You Get from TrueSRM
166
of suppliers or, if you take a single business unit, it will be a 
couple of thousand. But among this huge number of suppliers, 
only a handful of them really matter. In Fiore’s view, what Sutter 
and Braida did was to select a few suppliers to really focus on for 
relationship building and deprioritized all the others. The hard 
part of this exercise was the deprioritizing. According to Fiore, 
people were very skeptical initially, but with the first successes 
coming in, the mood changed very quickly. “Now, everybody at 
Heartland gets it.”
Consumers around the globe seem to agree with Fiore. The entire 
consumer-goods and retail industry is undergoing changes that 
are unprecedented since the introduction of the refrigerator and 
the supermarket. It is useful to think of the innovations Heartland 
is introducing as some kind of chain reaction. Its first-generation 
smart ice cream packaging increased consumers’ awareness of 
the importance of uninterrupted freezing by showing them when 
this had been compromised. The second-generation packaging 
would go on to become so effective that consumers could tell if 
they had left the product out of the freezer for too long, and it 
gave a warning before that point was reached that the temperature 
was in danger of becoming compromised.
Developing World Teaches the  
Developed World
Then came the third wave of supplier-based innovation, based 
on the dabbawalas working in India. Now a familiar sight 
in megacities, this new group of delivery people use carts or 
bicycles to transport goods. Heartland introduced this role to 
deliver products directly from the supplier to the consumer. In 
a recent report, A. T. Kearney, a global management consulting 
firm, argued that the dabbawalas working for Heartland have 
been highlighted as a key competitive advantage for Heartland 
and a real game changer in the supply chain for food. Trips to 
supermarkets have become the exception for city dwellers, as 
Heartland’s dabbawalas get you everything you need on short 
notice. On top of its environmental impact, the introduction of 
dabbawalas has been the tipping point for Heartland, with their 
market shares and revenues skyrocketing while those of their 
competitors have gone into a collective nosedive.
www.it-ebooks.info

167
Supplier Relationship Management
Rumor has it that Sutter and Braida came up with the idea  
to introduce dabbawalas for distribution to consumers during 
consecutive business meetings in Mumbai and New York City. 
In Mumbai, they saw the original dabbawalas delivering lunch 
boxes to office workers from their family homes to their offices. 
In Manhattan, they saw bicycle messengers and compared them 
to the dabbawala rickshaws that are a familiar sight in Mumbai. 
They then half-jokingly speculated what dabbawalas could do 
in New York. Days after having this idea, they were discussing 
implementation plans in earnest with potential suppliers.
Sutter and Braida took a big gamble. By going direct to consumers 
and bypassing retailers, they were jeopardizing the very foundation 
of Heartland’s business. But then, a glance at what had happened 
to the music and book businesses made the case very clear to 
Heartland’s executive board. Sutter is rumored to have said, “If 
we don’t do it, somebody else is going to do it. And I would rather 
be in control of our destiny than be at the mercy of some external 
forces.” In hindsight, one can conclude that Sutter was right. 
Heartland’s direct distribution business through the dabbawala 
supplier relationships grew much faster than its revenues with 
retailers. And with retailers closing down outlets everywhere, 
they are becoming increasingly obsolete to Heartland.
Living the Dream
Konstantin Bauer, my personal dabbawala in my hometown of 
Munich, explained how he feels about his Heartland-enabled 
side job. He studied physics at the Technical University and has 
always worked to finance his studies. Bauer describes his office 
jobs: “On top of being boring, they left me out of shape. You 
know, I sit in the lab, I sit at my desk in the dorm studying, and 
I sat in an office. Days got too short to do exercise. When I was 
still in high school, I would work out two or three hours a day; 
here in Munich I sometimes did not do any exercise for two or 
three days in a row.”
Now, Bauer works as an independent dabbawala supplier for 
three to four hours a day. He has an app on his smartphone that 
tells him when and where to pick up the deliveries for his tour. 
His area is a bit suburban, so he uses a hand cart. Bauer told me, 
“At the start of the tour, the cart I push is so heavy that I can 
hardly lift the handles. But since I am usually running while I 
deliver the items, it is a great workout that makes my muscles

ache and it feels fantastic. Most of my friends are dabbawalas 
as well. Each of us has a different style. Some of them have 
even started to balance those large trays on their heads that the 
original dabbawalas in India are using.”
Bauer always works in the same neighborhood, which means 
that most people know him and he knows them. Some even 
put their keys in a secret place for him so that he can put their 
groceries into the fridge for them. Of course, as he recounts, 
those are the ones that give the biggest tips. This system is very 
much based on trust.
Bauer explains that “the pay as a Heartland dabbawala is very 
good, but then there is also this coolness factor. We get these 
fancy outfits and all of us are really fit and trim. In Munich, 
there are now even pretend dabbawalas who wear the outfit in 
the clubs. That is something we don’t do.”
Asked about his aspirations after graduation, Konstantin Bauer 
has a very clear idea: “I want to join the research division of 
Heartland in Fort Wayne. This is the one place to be for a scientist. 
I spent a day on the premises last summer when I travelled the 
Midwest. Even their old site was pretty cool, but the new one 
they are building right now blows your mind. It will be ready 
just when I graduate.”
Building New Ecosystems with Suppliers
Bauer is very conscious that he is doing something special. 
What he is dreaming about is opening new doors for Heartland. 
He firmly believes that in the future the food industry and the 
pharmaceutical industry will converge. “Let’s face it, what the 
pharmaceutical industry has been doing over the past 150 years 
is pumping the human body full of chemicals and finding out in a 
trial-and-error process how it will respond to them. And then it sold 
the resulting approved drugs in a one-size-fits-all model through 
pharmacies. Yet we know that depending on gender, age, weight, 
and many other personal factors, everybody reacts to drugs in a 
different way.”
In Bauer’s vision, each of us will wear a smart device, for example 
a watch, that will monitor our bodily functions on an ongoing 
basis. This device will be linked to an intelligent health care 
system, a virtual doctor with unlimited knowledge so to speak. 
If some of your parameters go out of predefined boundaries, 
a device in your home will custom make drugs for your very

personal conditions at this specific point in time. Bauer asked 
me to imagine this like a very sophisticated 3D printer that prints 
a power bar for you.
If Bauer and Heartland are right, then the ability to engineer new 
relationships with suppliers and create innovative ecosystems 
will be crucial for success in the future. This does not only 
apply in the food industry but also in a far more broad scope. 
Companies cannot hope to create all the innovations that they 
need purely internally. They need to partner, focus on the handful 
of key relationships that have the right strategic potential, and 
work relentlessly to build the right ecosystems.
Heartland may well be the one company that can pull this off. 
They have proven to be willing to overcome established beliefs 
and they are able to create ecosystems that are changing entire 
industries. Bauer knows that in order to get into Heartland he 
will have to compete against the best graduates of the world’s 
most prestigious academic institutions. He is studying night and 
day to get there. The vision that Heartland has created is why 
many of the best and the brightest are doing likewise. It is only a 
matter of time before the rest of the world copies Heartland.
A Final Word
In this book, we have introduced and explained TrueSRM—a way of work-
ing with suppliers that is strongly differentiated based on performance and 
strategic potential. Companies need to focus most of their attention on 
the handful of relationships that have the high strategic potential to really 
make a difference in their competitiveness. As we see more and more 
dysfunctional change across industries, the ability to harness these Critical 
Cluster relationships will be of more and more importance. As the bound-
aries between industries increasingly converge, no single company will 
internally possess all of the capabilities that are needed for future success.
Done well, TrueSRM is the key to staying relevant in a changing world. It 
goes far beyond the concerns of “traditional” procurement. We implore 
you to embrace it.

Preface
It is quite unusual to find white space on the map of a field as thoroughly 
researched as procurement. Therefore, it took us some time to understand 
how enormous the white space of supplier relationship management, or 
SRM, actually is. Indeed, the reader may well even question this assertion, 
given that SRM is hardly a new term. It has been talked and written about 
for decades and it has been applied in many ways. Sometimes it is even 
taken as synonymous for procurement itself. The closer we looked at 
SRM though, the bigger our fascination with the subject became. Just 
consider the careless use of the word partner. What exactly qualifies 
a supplier as a partner? Is a supplier that consumes a large share of a 
company’s budget and provides excellent service at highly competitive 
prices a partner? And even if one business unit, one functional entity, or 
one hierarchy level thinks so, does the remainder of the company agree 
and does it manage the relationship to this alleged partner in a consistent 
way? And again, what is SRM anyway? 
In truth, SRM really is a white space in the sense that everyone talks about 
it, and many companies have implemented features of it, but hardly any 
organization has put in place a comprehensive approach to driving value 
from it. The final push came from a CPO roundtable in New York City 
in April 2013. We quizzed the 50 CPOs present, who represent many 
of the most prestigious American businesses, with some of the previous 
questions. Their response was eye-opening—most of them identified 
SRM as a top-priority item, and none of them had seen any convincing 
approach to solve it. Before we knew it, we were totally absorbed by the 
subject and found ourselves dedicating spare minutes to SRM whenever 
we could. The result of our work in understanding and implementing 
SRM is this book. 
In this endeavor we were fortunately not alone. We also owe a great  
debt to many of our past and current colleagues at A. T. Kearney, who have 
been at the forefront of developing effective procurement practice over 
the years. Due to space considerations, we have to limit acknowledgements 
to those who gave us the most valuable assistance, both as discussion 
partners and as rich sources of ideas: Íñigo Aranzabal (Madrid),

Patrick van den Bossche (Washington), Jan van der Oord (Amsterdam), 
Mark van Weegen (Atlanta), Mirko Warschun (Munich), and Robyn Wright 
(London). Armin Scharlach from our Berlin office deserves a very special 
mention here for contributing the key input to the chapter on the role 
of IT in SRM. Our gratitude also goes out to our A. T. Kearney editorial 
team, especially Patricia Sibo, without whom this book would not have 
been possible. We also owe special gratitude to Jeff Olson, our editor at 
Apress, who has been as sympathetic and supportive of our ideas as ever. 
Last, but not least, Tomaž Nečemar designed the cover and we are highly 
appreciative of his design capabilities.
We are confident that this book will change the way companies deal 
with their suppliers in a way that ultimately benefits both parties. We 
hope it will encourage our readers to drive alignment across business 
units, functional entities, and hierarchy levels. Our hope is that you enjoy 
reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it.
