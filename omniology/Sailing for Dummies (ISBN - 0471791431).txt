About the Authors
JJ and Peter Isler have been sailing for most of their lives. JJ grew up around
boats in San Diego, California, learning to sail in a little 7-foot dinghy called a
Sabot. Peter started out loving powerboats and fishing (boys can be so
strange!), but took up sailing after his family moved to Connecticut when he
was 13 years old.
The Islers are well known throughout the world of sailing as top competitors
and teachers. They both have taught sailing to people of all ages and experi-
ences. Peter played an important, early role in developing US Sailing’s educa-
tional program. He also coached at the Olympic level and helped found the
American Sailing Association, which accredits sailing schools and certifies
sailors and instructors.
Peter has twice won the America’s Cup, serving as navigator aboard Stars &
Stripes with Dennis Conner in 1987 and 1988. An accomplished small-boat
sailor, Peter was Intercollegiate Sailor of the Year while at Yale University. He
was the top-ranked U.S. sailor on the professional match-racing circuit for
five years and has won many of the world’s major ocean races, including the
Bermuda Race and the Transpac (where he navigated Morning Glory to an
elapsed time record in 2005).
Peter has also been very active in the media. In the 1990s, he shifted his
America’s Cup energies to television, where he was a featured analyst in
ESPN’s Emmy Award–winning Cup coverage in 1992 and 1995. More recently,
he covered sailing for the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), including its coverage
of the 2003 America’s Cup. He is the author of several books on the sport and
is presently Editor at Large of Sailing World magazine. In his spare time, Peter
enjoys playing guitar and keyboard with his band, The Water Brothers.
JJ is the only American female (so far) to have won two Olympic medals in
sailing, and she is the first female inductee in the Sailing World Hall of Fame.
With crew member Pamela Healy, JJ won the Bronze Medal in the Women’s
470 class in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. In the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, she and crew member Pease Glaser won the Silver. JJ is a
four-time Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year (in 1986, 1991, 1997, and 2000) and
has won three World Championships and numerous national titles. She was
the first female to compete in a number of events on the international match-
racing circuit. And in 1995 she was the tactician and starting helmsman for
the America3 Women’s America’s Cup team. She graduated from Yale
University where she was captain of the sailing team and a collegiate All-
American.
The Islers reside in San Diego with their two daughters, Marly and Megan,
their two cats, two chickens, five fish, eight boats, numerous sailboards, and
a lot of miscellaneous sailboat parts that Peter plans on using someday.

Dedication
To our daughters, Marly and Megan.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We first want to thank our two daughters who were so patient (and helpful)
through this revision — and thanks to the wonderful Francis Parker School
that is teaching them to enjoying learning about so many things. Our friend
(and famous author of several For Dummies titles and lead guitarist in Peter’s
band) Peter Economy encouraged us to do this second edition revision and
provided plenty of advice along the way. Josh Adams and John Burnham
helped us find our great illustrator, Michael Boardman. Mike Dorgan provided
his experience and insight in the process of buying a boat (see Chapter 20).
And Urban Miyares shared his expertise on sailing with disabilities. Harry
Munns stepped up to provide his services as technical editor. Harry has the
qualifications to write any book about sailing, so we’re really lucky to have
his help here. And our friends at IMG Literary have remained consistently
professional and ever helpful since day one, when we wrote the proposal for
the first edition.
We are very proud of the first edition of Sailing For Dummies and the success
it achieved, but we want to thank Tracy Boggier, Joyce Pepple, our project
editor Chad Sievers, and the rest of the Wiley’s For Dummies team that
worked so hard on helping us produce this new-and-improved second 
edition.
One of the things we’re most pleased of in this second edition is the new art-
work and photographs. And we definitely needed a little help from our friends
to get the photos that we wanted. So in no particular order, our heartfelt
thanks go to Mike Boardman of Boardman Designs (for the updated illustra-
tions); Andy Burdick and the team at Melges Performance Boats; Tim Wilkes,
Keith and Nigel Musto, and their team at Musto Performance Clothing; Glenn
Bourke and his team running the Volvo Ocean Race; Tom Carruthers and Whit
Batchelor of J World San Diego; Lew Newlands and Offshore Challenges; Craig
Leweck of Scuttlebutt (for loaning his camera to Peter when the perfect shot
appeared one day while they were out sailing); Christine DeSimone and
Sunsail; Nick White and his Expedition Software; and last but not least, up-
and-coming sailing star, Emily Bohl. And finally, this book (and especially the
first edition) never would have happened (at least not anywhere close to
deadline) without the carpool and childcare support from JJ’s parents and
our next-door neighbors, Jane and Tom Fetter.

We still appreciate the efforts of many people whose help with the first edi-
tion still shines through in this edition, including Brad Dellenbaugh; Sally
Samins, who shot the photos (and helped us find the ones we couldn’t
shoot); and Jeff Johnson, who helped immensely, as did our neighbor Aine
McLean (a great capsizing-photo model). Other people and organizations
who helped with the first edition are Pat Healy, Doug Ament at H&S Yacht
Sales, Geri Conser (for that great aerial photo of JJ and Pam), Billy Black,
Kristen Lawton, Doug Skidmore, and Matt Miller — the folks at Hobie Cat,
Jason Campbell, Tom Leweck, Cam Lewis, Skip Novak, Mark Reiter, Marty
Ehrlich, Rich Roberts, Katie Poe, Dennis Conner, the San Diego Yacht Club,
and the American Sailing Association.
People who have played a key role in Peter’s education as a sailor and a
teacher include his mother, Marilyn Isler Brunger; Ted Jones, who bent some
rules at Norwalk (Connecticut) Yacht Club so Peter could join the junior sail-
ing program; Kendrick Wilson; Tyler Keys; Tom Whidden; Richard Hokin; Stan
Honey; Steve Benjamin; Dave Perry; Lenny Shabes; Robert Hopkins; Gary
Jobson; and John Rousmaniere.
JJ would like to thank her sailing instructors — Jack Wood, Mark and DeAnn
Reynolds, and Dave Perry — for instilling an early and lasting love of the
sport. Also, thanks to Pease Glaser, Pamela Healy, the U.S. Olympic Sailing
Committee and her Olympic coaches, and Bill Koch for giving her the oppor-
tunity to take her sailing to a higher level.
Finally, we would like to thank you for your interest in “our” sport. May the
wind always be at your back, and if it must come from ahead, may your sails
be well shaped and trimmed in tight!

Introduction
There is nothing — absolutely nothing — half so much worth doing as
simply messing about in boats.
—Water Rat to Mole, Kenneth Grahame, The Wind in the Willows
W
hat gives sailing such enchanting prospects? Water Rat certainly had
a piece of the puzzle. Messing about in a boat — any kind of boat — is
great fun. You escape the cares and stresses of everyday life, conveyed on a
craft powered solely by the forces of nature. The spell that the wind casts
onto the sails of a boat is bewitching to behold.
Maybe the best part of sailing is the part that your imagination can latch
onto, conveying your mind to places you’ve never been, promising experi-
ences yet untold. And no matter how experienced you become or how much
water passes beneath your keel, sailing still has more to offer. The sport is so
vast that no one can experience all of sailing’s facets in a single lifetime.
But enough generalizing. After all, you wouldn’t have picked up this book if
you weren’t already at least intrigued by the allure of sailing.
About This Book
In this book, you can find all the information you need to go sailing. This book
is a textbook, user’s manual, and reference book all in one. We start with basic
sailing skills and move on to cover more advanced topics for when you widen
your horizons to activities such as chartering a boat and going cruising. You
get to practice tying knots, and we talk about what to wear on a boat. (You can
skip the blue blazer and captain’s hat, but soft-soled shoes are a must.) You
find out how to sail such diverse crafts as a sailboard and a catamaran, how to
forecast the weather, and how to find a boat that’s right for you. You even dis-
cover the basics of sailboat racing. We cover all you need to know to be safe
on the water, and we make the whole process easy and fun!

Conventions Used in This Book
Have you ever listened in on the conversation of two sailors? Sailing has so
many specific words that sailors can sound like they’re speaking a foreign
language. But don’t let the jargon turn you off. The language of sailing has an
old and rich tradition, and as you become more comfortable in a sailboat,
you gradually pick up more and more of the language and become a part of
the sailing tradition yourself.
In this book, we try to avoid sailing jargon as much as possible, but we can’t
get around it completely because some of the terms are very important for
safety. When the skipper plans a maneuver that requires a coordinated crew
effort, using and understanding the exact sailing term allows everyone on the
boat to know what’s happening and what to do.
We use the following conventions to help you understand everything that
we’re discussing and to stay consistent:
 We italicize boat names and new terms and follow them with an easy-to-
understand definition. We also list most of the italicized terms in the
glossary so you can brush up on sailing terminology.
 We bold important keywords in bulleted lists as well as the action parts
of numbered lists.
 We use monofont for all Web addresses.
Finally, in this book we simply refer to boats or sailboats. We sometimes fur-
ther differentiate between bigger sailboats with keels (keelboats) and smaller
sailboats with centerboards (dinghies) as needed for the subject we’re cover-
ing. (In the United States, a yacht is the snobby cousin of the boat, but in New
Zealand and much of the current and former British Empire, the word yacht
has no snob connotations. You can use yacht safely, without giving away any-
thing about yourself, in place of boat or sailboat.)
What You’re Not to Read
We love telling sea stories — and we include our favorites in this book. But if
you’re looking for just the purely instructional information, you can skip the
places where you see the Peter Says or JJ Says icons (see “Icons Used in This
Book,” later in this Introduction, for other icons used).
Sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear occasionally. We use the sidebars
to go off on a tack (a basic sailing maneuver where you turn your boat and
sail in a different direction) and go into more depth on a topic or give you a
2
Sailing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

bit of interesting information that isn’t strictly essential. So you can skip side-
bars, although we hope you come back to them someday.
Foolish Assumptions
The most foolish assumption we made when we wrote the first edition of this
book was that only our parents and a few close friends would ever read it.
We’ve been overwhelmed by the positive responses to the first edition, and
we hope you enjoy all the new information we’ve crammed into this book. We
assume one or more of the following about you, our reader:
 You’ve been given this book as a gift by a friend who wants to take you
sailing.
 You get dragged out on the water by your sailing-loving family, and you
don’t really know what to do.
 You’ve always been intrigued by the sea.
 You may have had a bad experience on the water, but now you want to
give sailing another try.
 Your child has been bitten by the sailboat-racing bug, and you want to
figure out what you’re watching.
 You love the water and enjoy powerboats, but now with the world’s oil
reserves dwindling, a sailboat seems better for the environment (and
cheaper).
 You’re staying at a friend’s beach cottage, and you picked up this book
because you just finished your trashy romance novel.
 You discovered the basics of sailing at summer camp and you haven’t
sailed since then, but now you want to charter a boat in the Caribbean.
 You already enjoy sailing and want a good, complete reference book and
ideas to explore some new directions in the sport.
We wrote this book to lure you into the sport that we love — no matter how
you came to turn that first page.
How This Book Is Organized
Unlike a novel, this book isn’t designed for you to read it from cover to cover.
Depending on your familiarity with sailing, you may want to begin by reading
Chapter 1 or Chapter 5 or Chapter 15 — the choice is up to you. If we write
about something important that we cover in more depth elsewhere, we tell
you where to turn. Simple? We think so.

Introduction

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet
The four chapters in this section ensure that your first experience on the
water is comfortable and fun, even if you’ve never been on a sailboat before.
Chapter 1 takes a broad overview of the sport, looks at the different types of
sailboats and some of their basic parts, and introduces the basics of sailing.
Chapter 2 covers your options of where to go to discover sailing. And as you’re
preparing for that first day on the water, Chapter 3 answers that age-old ques-
tion, “What should I wear?” (which on smaller boats should always include a
life jacket). In Chapter 4, you step aboard a boat and prepare the sails and gear
for your first adventure afloat, powered by the force of the wind.
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away
This section is the meat of the book for the new sailor. Chapter 5 is the big
kahuna, covering the principles of sailing: how to get your boat from point A
to point B (and back again). Chapter 6 wraps up the basics by showing you
how to sail away from a dock or mooring and how to launch your boat from a
trailer, ramp, or beach. Chapter 7 discusses safety, because you need to be
prepared when you’re out on the water. We show you where the safest spots
are to enjoy your ride, how to rescue a man overboard, and how to get going
again if your boat tips over. Chapter 8 is great for anyone interested in
weather (which, by the way, includes all sailors). Identifying the weather
helps you know whether those dark clouds on the horizon are going to dump
rain on you, bring wind, or both. And Chapter 9 covers navigation, including
how to read charts, plot your course, use a compass, and find your position
while at sea (without having to stop at the nearest gas station for directions).
Chapter 10 focuses on anchoring. Even powerboaters need to know the infor-
mation in Chapters 7 through 10 before heading out on the water.
Part III: Sailing Fast — Taking 
Your Sailing to the Next Level
We intend the first two chapters of this section to be most helpful for interme-
diate and advanced sailors who have at least a season of sailing under their
belts. Chapter 11 provides plenty of tips to sailing faster, including surfing
waves and sailing catamarans — those speedy boats with two hulls. Chapter
12 introduces you to the subtleties of adjusting the shape of your sails. This
chapter also shows you how to use a spinnaker — that colorful sail for going
fast downwind. Chapter 13 acquaints you with our favorite world of sailboat
racing.
4
Sailing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part IV: Sailing Away 
for a Year and a Day
This part helps you with special circumstances you may encounter, no matter
if you’re out for a day cruise or for a much longer time. Chapter 14 covers what
to do on an unlucky day: when you run aground, break something, or have to
abandon ship. In Chapter 15, we introduce you to the basics of maintenance —
keeping your ship in shape. Chapter 16 helps you enjoy sailing with children,
because you get to go sailing more often if your family enjoys the sport, too.
Chapter 17 introduces you to the great world of chartering (renting) sailboats
and going cruising. Affordable boats are available for charter in exotic loca-
tions around the world. Chapter 18 focuses on how to sail a sailboard — those
surfboards with sails that we love and you’ve always wanted to try.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without this section. Sailboats always have
plenty of rope, and Chapter 19 reminds you how to tie those knots you prac-
ticed in Girl or Boy Scouts and tells you which one to use when. Chapter 20
poses ten questions to help you find the right boat for you. Chapter 21 has a
list of ten of our favorite things about sailing.
Part VI: Appendixes
Appendix A has a glossary with all the sailing lingo you need to impress your
friends and sound like a yachtie. Appendix B covers first aid afloat — from
what to have in your first-aid kit to how to handle the most common medical
problems at sea. Finally, in Appendix C we cover how a sailboat moves for
those technical types who always want to know “how” and “why.”
Icons Used in This Book
You may notice icons, or cute little pictures, in the margins of this book.
Those icons do more than just break up the white space; they tell you some-
thing about that particular paragraph.
This symbol helps you avoid common mistakes while you’re just starting out
and alerts you to potential dangers. As a sailor, you need to have a healthy
respect for the power of the wind and the sea.

Introduction

Our many years of sailing have resulted in some wonderful memories and
some unusual stories. This icon indicates a story from JJ’s own experiences.
Peter also has a few stories to tell, and we use this icon to point those 
stories out.
This icon points out information that we don’t want you to forget. Store it in
your brain for quick recall at a later time.
This icon, shaped like one of the life jackets you read about in Chapter 3,
highlights advice to help keep you and your loved ones safe.
In sailing, because you’re letting the wind do the work, the easy way is the
right way. These tips can help you find the easy way.
Where to Go from Here
Where you start is up to you. If you’re brand new to the world of sailing, just
turn the page and start with Chapter 1. If you’ve been around boats before,
browse through the table of contents and pick a chapter that interests you.
But do start somewhere. The faster you start, the faster we can share our
love of sailing with you. While cruising, we’ve explored some of the most
remote and beautiful parts of the world. While racing, we’ve had the chance
to challenge ourselves in international competitions and make friends around
the globe. Who knows? Maybe on one of our future voyages, we’ll even get a
chance to meet you.

In this part . . .
S
ome people think that sailors are incredibly snobby
rich people who hang out at the yacht club all day
sipping gin and tonics, wearing blue blazers, and talking
without moving their jaws (kind of like Thurston Howell III
in Gilligan’s Island). If this intimidating vision has kept you
from beginning to sail, this part is for you. We formally
introduce you to a sailboat and then show you where you
can take sailing lessons — from regular people and with
regular people. We also dispel those blue-blazer myths
and answer that incredibly important question that
mankind ponders every morning — what to wear? Finally
in this part, we look at what you need to know before you
leave the dock.

It is an interesting biological fact that all of us have, in our veins, the exact
same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and therefore,
we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the
ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch it —
we are going back from whence we came.
—John F. Kennedy
W
ater covers nearly three-quarters of the planet. Over the course of
human history, the oceans (as well as lakes and rivers) have served as
pathways upon which trade and civilization have developed. Getting away
from shore, you feel a link to those ancient mariners who set off for undiscov-
ered lands. When you’re flying across the water, you’re harnessing the same
forces of nature that powered the early explorers.
Why are humans drawn to the sea? President John F. Kennedy had a poetic
answer. Generations before you have felt the call of the wind and waves, beck-
oning to accept their offer of unknown possibilities — adventure and serenity.
Even in today’s high-tech, fast-paced world, sailing regularly rates high on poll-
sters’ lists of desirable activities. So if you ever find yourself dreaming of pack-
ing it all in and setting sail over the horizon or of simply having your own boat
to sail near home on a warm, breezy afternoon, you’re not alone. And this
chapter shows you that getting out on the water is easier than you think.

What You Need to Start Sailing
Starting sailing is a little different than starting most sports. In basketball,
you can start to learn the basic moves like dribbling and shooting without
worrying about the “playing field” — the court boundaries or the height of
the basket. But the sailor’s “playing field” — the wind and the water — is con-
stantly changing. The wind changes strength and direction while waves
and/or current change the water conditions. Sailing is harnessing the power
of Mother Nature, and sailors need a healthy respect for her power. So in this
section, we cover some important weather and safety considerations you
need to know before you start sailing.
Also in this section, we encourage you to begin your sailing career by taking
lessons from a qualified instructor — we both did — so you can focus on
learning the basic moves while the instructor makes sure the conditions are
suitable for learning.
Taking lessons
You can find sailboats near almost every body of water. And where you find
sailboats, you can find sailing schools and/or a sailing club with experienced
sailors looking for crew. Most boats longer than 15 feet (5 meters) are meant
to be sailed with more than one person, and the average 30-foot (9-meter)
sailboat is best sailed with at least four crew members. So go down to the
local marina, check out the bulletin board, and ask around. The offers you get
to go sailing may pleasantly surprise you.
Although having friends to take you sailing can make practicing and progress-
ing easy, we strongly recommend taking lessons from a sailing school with
certified instructors before you head out on your own. For a variety of safety
reasons, we don’t recommend sailing alone while learning the basics. In
Chapter 2, we help you find the right sailing course for any experience level.
Location, location, location
You can probably guess that the weather and water conditions in a given area
affect the sailing possibilities, and that most sailors put away their sailing
clothes in wintertime in the snowy latitudes whilst Southern Californians can
sail year round. But even snow and ice can’t stop some die-hard enthusiasts
who sail ice boats on frozen northern lakes. Not to be outdone, adventurous
sailors in dry, desert areas blast around on “land yachts” or “dirt boats” with
10
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

wheels. Assuming that you plan to go sailing on regular, salt or fresh, non-
frozen water, then your main concerns are twofold: the water conditions
(waves, currents, depth, and water temperature) and the wind conditions
(wind strength and changeability). Some areas have very consistent condi-
tions during a particular season, and others are more variable. In some
places, a typically windy spot and a calm location may be less than a mile
apart due to some geographic feature.
That’s why knowing the local conditions can be invaluable to any sailor. We
encourage new sailors to start out, if possible, in steady light-to-medium
winds and protected (calm) waters — and a sailing school knows where and
when to find those conditions in your area. But as you gain experience, you
can enjoy sailing in more challenging conditions — such as windy Chicago or
San Francisco in midsummer, cruising in foggy Maine, or blasting down the
Molokai Channel in Hawaii.
Feeling the wind
You probably know that a sailboat doesn’t move unless it has wind. (Yes —
you can start up the engine, get a tow, get out a paddle, or swim along pulling
your boat — but we’re talking about “sailing” using the power of the sails,
right?) The wind rules a sailor’s universe — it’s the sailor’s alpha and omega.
To become a sailor, you need to raise your awareness of the weather, starting
with the importance of feeling and finding the wind’s direction.
Look around for a nearby flag and use its direction as a clue. In Chapter 5, we
show you how to develop your feel for sensing the wind direction and staying
aware of any shifts (without having the local weatherman on your speed
dial). Knowing the wind’s direction is crucial because you get your boat to
move by adjusting the angle of the sails relative to the wind’s direction. When
the wind direction changes or you change course, you need to change your
sail trim, or the angle of your sails to the wind, as you see in Chapter 5.
No matter how constant the weather seems on shore, the wind is frequently
shifting both speed and direction. Staying aware of these changes is important
for your safety and comfort while sailing. Sensing the wind’s speed is impor-
tant too so you avoid going sailing when the wind is too strong or blustery
and so you can avoid getting becalmed, unable to sail if the wind dies. Listen
to the local marine forecast before a day of sailing to help you avoid getting
caught in unpleasant (and potentially dangerous) conditions on the water —
such as thunderstorms or thick fog. (You can also check out Chapter 8, which
discusses important weather-related information you need to know before
heading out.)
11
Chapter 1: Ready, Set, Go: Time to Start Sailing

Considering safety
Before going out on the water, you need to consider some safety issues and
be prepared with basic safety gear, especially life jackets. In Chapter 3, we
give you plenty of tips for what to wear and bring so you’re comfortable and
safe on the water. Chapter 7 covers other essential safety information, such
as safely recovering a person who falls overboard and getting a capsized
dinghy upright and sailing again.
Looking at a Sailboat
Sailboats come in all sizes, shapes, and types. The beauty of sailing is that
you can’t help but find a boat (or two or three) that’s just right for you. All
sailing craft, big or small, have at least one (and sometimes more) of the fol-
lowing components, which we outline in the following sections: a hull, an
underwater fin for steering control and stability, a mast to hold up the sail or
sails, a sail, and plenty of rope.
12
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 
What floats your boat?
Have you ever sat in a boat and wondered how
in the heck it doesn’t sink? Well you don’t have
to wonder anymore.
Your boat floats because it’s less dense than the
water in which it sits. Density is expressed as
mass per unit volume. The density of freshwa-
ter is 62.2 pounds per cubic foot (1 gram per
cubic centimeter). Saltwater is denser at 64
pounds per cubic foot, so a given object can
float better (or higher) in saltwater than in fresh-
water. In saltwater, a boat floats if it’s less dense
than 64 pounds per cubic foot, including every-
thing on board: mast, sails, and people. For
example, if the density of a boat in saltwater 
is 32 pounds per cubic foot (1⁄2 gram per cubic
centimeter), the boat floats half in and half out of
the water.
The weight of a boat is also called its displace-
ment, because the boat displaces (or pushes
aside) a volume of water equal to its weight. An
object with a very light displacement, such as a
surfboard, lies on top of the water like a leaf. A
boat with a heavy displacement sits lower in the
water, displacing more water to stay afloat.
Here’s the amazing part. You can build boats of
nonbuoyant (denser-than-water) materials,
such as steel or concrete, as long as you design
them with enough volume so that their total den-
sity is less than the density of the water. As
proof of that principle, consider that an empty
aluminum soda can floats, but the same can
sinks if you flatten it and decrease its volume.
(Of course, don’t try this experiment on the
water — you’d be littering.)

All sailboats have a hull
The hull is (ideally) the floating body of a boat, and it can be made of a wide
variety of materials, including wood, fiberglass, metal, plastic — even cement.
The hull can be as small as a surfboard or more than 100 feet (30 meters) long.
You can get a good idea about how fast a boat is by how it looks. Just as you
can tell that a sports car will be faster than a golf cart, you can tell that a big,
heavy, wide boat with a short mast is a good cruiser but won’t break any
speed records on the water. Sailboats fall into three basic types based on
their hull shape, as Figure 1-1 illustrates.
 Sailboards: These boats are basically surfboards with a sail. They come
in many different sizes and shapes, depending on their intended use and
the skill level of the rider. Sailboarding is a great way to enjoy the sport
with equipment that you can throw on the roof of your car. For fun,
recreational sailing (as opposed to racing), we love sailboarding more
than any other aspect of our sport. For those of you who doubt the aero-
bic benefits of the sport of sailing, try windsurfing for an afternoon. We
promise that every muscle in your body will be tired afterward. For
more on sailboarding, check out Chapter 18.
 Multihulls: Multihulls are boats with more than one hull (makes sense,
doesn’t it?). A boat with two hulls is called a catamaran; a boat with
three hulls, a trimaran. Multihulls, especially small, light ones, can be
thrilling to sail — with a little wind, one hull lifts out of the water, and
you feel like you’re flying across the water. (You can find out more about
sailing a small catamaran, often referred to as a cat [without the fur] in
Chapter 11.) Bigger multihulls (more than 30 feet, or 9 meters) can be
great cruising boats. Because of their width, they’re very stable and

Chapter 1: Ready, Set, Go: Time to Start Sailing

have a tremendous amount of space for their length. Multihulls are fast,
too, because they’re very light and don’t have heavy keels, or as much
surface area underwater, as monohulls (boats with one hull) of the same
size. Check out “All sailboats have an underwater fin” to find out more
about the daggerboards used on most multihulls instead of a keel. Huge,
120-foot- (37-meter-) plus multihulls compete in races across oceans and
hold most of the point-to-point, long-distance sailing speed records,
including sailing nonstop around the world in 50 days! (For more on the
fast world of offshore racing, see Chapter 13.)
 Monohulls: These sailboats are the most common type of boat, and they
have one hull (still makes sense, right?). Most of the world’s sailing and
racing takes place in monohulls, broadly classified as either dinghies 
or keelboats, as the next section explains. Most sailing schools teach
their basic sailing classes in monohulls — either dinghies or keelboats
(although some specialty schools, often in tropical climes, teach sail-
boarding skills). For more on learning how to sail, including types of
boats and where to find a good school, check out Chapter 2. The typical
marina is full of monohull keelboats of all shapes and sizes. And if you’re
the type of person who likes to ask “What kind of boat is that?” turn to
Chapter 20 on recognizing boat logos and Appendix A (otherwise known
as the glossary) on how to identify different monohulls, such as a ketch,
a catboat, and a sloop.
If you compare these water-based crafts to their land-based cousins, sail-
boards are the skateboards, dinghies are the bicycles, and keelboats are the
cars. And multihulls? The fastest ones are airplanes!
All sailboats have an underwater fin
Hanging underneath the back end of most sailboats (except sailboards) is a
rotating fin called a rudder. The rudder does just what you think it does — it
steers the boat. Underneath the middle of most sailboats is a second, larger,
fin called a keel or centerboard.
Comparing keelboats and dinghies
The primary purpose of both keels and centerboards is to keep the boat from
skidding sideways from the force of the wind and to provide lift so your boat
can sail closer to the wind. (When sailing, your sails and the underwater fins
act like wings. If your physics teacher explained wings when you weren’t
paying attention, see Appendix C for a quick review.) Although a few excep-
tions exist, if the fin is fixed (not movable) and made of a heavy material like
lead, it’s usually a keel. And if the fin is lightweight and retractable, it’s usu-
ally a centerboard.
 Keelboats: Keelboats have a keel, a fixed, heavy lead fin for ballast hang-
ing under their hull, as Figure 1-2 shows, providing stability against the
14

wind’s force. The smallest keelboats are model (sometimes radio-
controlled) sailboats, but keelboats that carry human passengers are
usually more than 20 feet (6 meters) in length.
 Dinghies: Dinghies are nimble, small sailboats that are typically more
responsive than their ballasted cousins sporting keels. But watch out —
dinghies can capsize, or tip over. Instead of that ballast weight in the
keel, they have a lighter fin called a centerboard that’s retractable. The
centerboard may also be called a daggerboard if it retracts vertically
(see Figure 1-3), depending on its position and movement (or a leeboard
if it’s mounted on the side of the boat). Most dinghies range in length
from 8 to 20 feet (2.5 to 6 meters).

Chapter 1: Ready, Set, Go: Time to Start Sailing

Comparing tillers and wheels
So how do you drive (or steer, in sailor speak)? Well, those rudders shown in
Figures 1-2 and 1-3 are connected to either a tiller, a long lever arm that
allows you to turn the rudder, or a wheel, which is attached to cables that
turn the rudder. Generally, smaller boats have tillers, and bigger boats have
wheels, because bigger boats have greater force on the rudder and would
require an enormous lever arm.
A boat with a wheel steers just like your car — turn left to go left, right to go
right. But you push a tiller to the right to turn left and to the left to go to the
right. (Check out Chapter 4 for more on steering.) Steering sounds trickier
than it really is — a tiller is quite responsive, and you quickly develop a “feel”
for the correct way to turn.
All sailboats have a mast
The mast is the vertical pole that supports the sails, as the dinghy shows in
Figure 1-4. Although most modern sailboats have just one mast, some sail-
boats have several masts that can carry many sails. (Remember the pictures
of the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria in your history textbook?) You may have
heard of square riggers, schooners, or yawls. These types of sailing craft are
named for the number and position of their masts and the profile of the sails.
If you want to know how to identify these cool, usually older, antiquated sail-
boats, check out the glossary.
Although older boats have wooden masts, most modern boats have masts
made of aluminum, which is easier to mass-produce into a lighter and
stronger pole. For the ultimate in strength and light weight, the fastest racing
boats use carbon fiber. On bigger boats, an array of wires usually supports
the mast. These wires are called the standing rigging (see the forestay, back-
stay, and shrouds on the keelboat in Figure 1-5).
16
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

All sailboats have sails
The mast (and standing rigging) supports the third and most common feature
of sailboats — the sails. A sail is simply a big piece of fabric that catches the
wind, enabling you to use its force to move the boat. The sails are your
engines — their power or fuel comes from the wind. The main, or mainsail,
sets along the back edge of the tallest mast. Some boats carry only a main-
sail, while others have a headsail as well. A headsail sets in front of the mast.
Headsails come in different types, but the most common is a jib. See Figures
1-5 and 1-6 for the basic parts of a dinghy and a keelboat.

Chapter 1: Ready, Set, Go: Time to Start Sailing

You can use one of many types of specialty sails to make a boat go as fast as
possible at different angles to the wind. A common specialty headsail is the
spinnaker — a big, colorful, parachute-like sail used when sailing downwind
(going with the wind), which you can see how to fly in Chapter 12.

All sailboats have lots of rope
When a sailboat is rigged (prepared and ready to go sailing), all the ropes
used to raise and adjust the sails can look like spaghetti. This pasta is all part
of the boat’s running rigging. Even the simplest sailboat has several adjust-
ment ropes, and each has its own name. For example, the rope running up
mast that’s used to pull the sails up is called the halyard. Just to make every-
thing more confusing, the “proper” names for ropes on a sailboat, when they
have a purpose and use, are lines, as in “Throw me a line.” But most sailors
use the terms interchangeably without confusing their crews, and they are
equally acceptable (and we use both terms in this book).
When you’re starting out, understanding what the lines do is more important
than worrying about what to call them. So the only line that you need to
know to start sailing is the sheet — the primary line that adjusts the sail trim
(the angle of the sail to the wind), referred to with the sail it adjusts (for
example, mainsheet and jib sheet).
Depending on the wind strength and the size of the sails, pulling in the main-
sheet (and most of the other lines) can be a tough job. Most boats use a system
of blocks, or pulleys, to make pulling in the lines that carry a lot of load easier.
So you don’t have to hold that mainsheet with your teeth when your arms get
tired, the typical mainsheet system also has a conveniently located cleat.
In a sailboat, the wind is your fuel, and the sail is your engine. So the gas
pedal is the sheet (shown in Figure 1-6), the rope that pulls in the sail and
harnesses the power of the wind.
19
Chapter 1: Ready, Set, Go: Time to Start Sailing
Not all sails are created equal
Back in the old days of square riggers, sails
were made out of cotton. They were heavy and
very stretchy. Today, most sails are made out of
a polyester fiber called Dacron. But high-tech
racing boats have sails made out of exotic, light-
weight, yet strong materials, such as Mylar,
carbon fiber, and Kevlar (the fabric in bullet-
proof vests). In the 1988 America’s Cup, I sailed
aboard Stars & Stripes, a 65-foot (20-meter)
catamaran. Instead of “soft” sails, this boat had
a “hard wing” — very similar to the wing of 
a passenger jet. Constructed out of carbon 
fiber and other very strong and light materials,
this hard wing was really a mast and sail 
all wrapped up in one. Because of its three-
dimensional wing shape and innovative shape
controls, it was extremely fast — and we 
won the Cup! But at the end of each day of sail-
ing, the boat had to be carefully tipped on its
side (using a huge hydraulic contraption) to hide
the wing from any swirl of wind behind a wall.
Because you can’t just lower and fold up a hard
wing after a day on the water, this type of sail
isn’t very practical for everyday sailors . . . but 
it sure is fast!

Tackling Some Basic Sailing Maneuvers
Now that you know the basic components of a sailboat, you may have some
basic questions. Earlier in this chapter we cover “How do you drive this
thing?” (with the wheel or tiller connected to the rudder) and show you the
gas pedal, or mainsheet (see the previous section). If you’re a responsible
driver, your next question may be “Where’s the brake?” (or “How do you stop
this %#$@ thing?”). In this section we also answer a few basic questions you
may have, including “Can you sail anywhere?” and “Where to go next?”
Coasting to a stop
So you want to find the brake pedal? Unfortunately, sailboats can’t stop on a
dime (unless you run them into something hard like land, throw out an
Mainsheet
Block
Boom
Mast
Figure 1-6:

system on a
dinghy.
20
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

anchor, or take other drastic measures). Essentially, a sailboat has no brake.
But when you let out the sheet and let the sail luff, or flap in the wind like a
flag, you’ve taken your foot off the gas pedal, and your boat can coast to a
stop. Heavier boats take longer to slow down (because of momentum).
Some new sailors get nervous when the sails start luffing, or flapping — the
sails are loud, and the sheets attached to the sails can start whipping around
if conditions are windy. But relax. Luffing sails produce no power, and the
boat gently decelerates. So just stay low and out of the path of the flapping
sail (and that hard boom), as Figure 1-7 shows.
Sailing into the wind
You may wonder if you can sail anywhere. Our answer is yes, you can sail
anywhere! You can even sail to a point directly into the wind, but not by just
steering straight there. If you try steering your boat directly into the wind,
your sails luff, and you slow down and come to a stop. So to sail to a point
directly upwind, you must take an indirect zigzag route, as Figure 1-8 shows.
First, the zig: Pull in your sails (with their sheets) as hard as you can and
then steer a course as close as you can to the wind direction without having
the sails flap. Halfway to your destination, the time comes to zag and perform
the basic sailing maneuver of tacking. (Check out Chapter 5 for more about
tacking and other basic maneuvers.)
A tack entails about a 90-degree course change. In a tack, as you begin the
turn, your sails start to luff, or flap (because you’re steering directly toward
the oncoming wind). But as you continue your turn, the sails refill with the
wind now blowing across the opposite side. If you time your tack correctly,
you’re now steering directly toward your initial destination.
Arc of Boom
You must remember
to duck under the boom
as it comes across 
the boat.

getting hit in

Where You Can Go with Sailing
You can enjoy the wonderful sport of sailing in so many different ways. This
book shows you some of sailing’s amazing diversity. Sailing has taken us all
over the world. We probably wouldn’t have met, fallen in love, and had two
beautiful daughters if not for sailing (cue the soft violin music). Sailing has
romance, travel, excitement, and moonlit nights in secluded coves with the
sounds of the waves lapping against the hull. Of course, our seaborne
romance also brought diapers, college saving funds, book deadlines, and
mortgage payments — ah, yes, sailing has brought so much to our lives. And
it can bring wonderful adventures to your life too — if you just turn the page.

S
uppose that you don’t know how to sail but want to learn. (A good guess,
because you’re reading this book, right?) Sailing is a very accessible
sport if you know where to begin. Believe it or not, plenty of people would
love to introduce you to the joys of sailing. Depending on where you live, how
old you are, and who you know, you may have any number of options.
This chapter answers some key questions you may have, such as where you
can go to get started in sailing and what type of boat to start on. We highly
recommend attending sailing school, and we help you choose the right one
for you. This chapter looks at all your options for finding out about this great
sport.

Where You Can Go to Learn
So you’re interested in sailing but don’t know where to start. The following
list provides a few different ways you can start discovering more about this
great sport, but we strongly recommend that beginners take classes from a
certified sailing school:
 Through friends. Some of Peter’s friends introduced him to sailing in his
teens. Your first taste of the sport may be aboard a friend’s boat. But
unless your friend is a certified sailing instructor with plenty of free time
to dedicate to your education, you should probably just enjoy the ride
and plan on getting your first formal training from a professional sailing
instructor.
 By reading books and magazines. Many books have been written on 
all aspects of sailing — from sailing basics to classic sea adventures.
Chapter 16 lists some of the books that inspired us. A number of great
sailing magazines offer a combination of instruction, entertainment, and
feature stories for the sailor. Our favorite is Sailing World because it
focuses on the racing aspect of the sport (and Peter is the editor at
large). Some other great national magazines in the United States are
Cruising World, Sail, Yachting, and Sailing. Like many sports, sailing is
part mental and part physical. You can study its theories from an article,
a book, or in a classroom, but you can only discover some things with
the wind in your face and your hand on the tiller or ropes.
 On your own. Purchasing (or borrowing) a boat and teaching yourself to
sail is entirely possible. After all, sailing isn’t nuclear physics. However,
we don’t recommend teaching yourself (in fact, we totally discourage it)
because it may be downright dangerous. When you leave the shore
behind, you’re in the hands of Mother Nature — and she can be a harsh
taskmaster on occasion. We devote an entire chapter of this book to
safety afloat (Chapter 7) and provide safety tips throughout all the other
chapters too. Practice on your own, but learn the basics from a qualified
instructor first.
 In a formal class from a professional instructor. Have an idea of where
we’re heading? We feel very strongly that despite all the options, you
should get your education from a pro. See “Choosing a Sailing School,”
later in this chapter, for more detailed advice.
What Kind of Boat You Should Learn On
Not only can you choose where and how to start your sailing studies, but you
may have a choice of what kind of boat to start on. We both started on
dinghies, and so did Dennis Conner, Ted Turner, and most other “famous”
racing sailors. But then again, we started as kids, and almost all junior sailing
24
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

programs use dinghies. Dinghies are smaller boats (usually under 20 feet, 
or 6 meters, long) with a retractable centerboard; they can also tip over.
Keelboats are usually longer than 20 feet with fixed keels that provide extra
stability.
The bottom line: Consider the pluses and minuses of dinghies and keelboats
we outline in this section, and then go take lessons from the best instructor
you can find!
Dinghies
Many sailing schools and junior programs instruct beginners in small (10- to
14-foot, or 3- to 4-meter, long) one-person boats; others use larger two- or
three-person dinghies, as Figure 2-1 shows. Ideally the boat has a relatively
stable hull shape (not too tippy) and a conservative amount of sail area. No
need to break any speed records on your first sail!

Pros
The following are the advantages to using a dinghy for your training:
 They’re responsive. Due to the boat’s light weight, changes in helm,
weight position, and sail trim give instantaneous feedback. You can
really feel the boat sail.
 The helmsman trims a sail. On most dinghies (especially the single-
person variety), the helmsman must do more than just steer, providing
you with a more complete understanding of how everything works.

Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools

 They’re inexpensive. Therefore, they’re favored by many programs that
have limited budgets.
 Their smaller size makes them less intimidating. Would you rather take
your driver’s education class in a compact car or a minivan?
Cons
Starting to sail on a dinghy does have the following disadvantages:
 They can capsize. You can argue that the possibility of capsizing is a
“pro,” especially because we think that everyone who sails a dinghy
needs to know how to right a capsized boat. (We cover that subject in
Chapter 7.) Finding out how to right a flipped boat, however, isn’t a pri-
ority if you start on a keelboat.
 They’re wet. Typically, you sit lower to the water in a dinghy than on a
keelboat, and being wet can be uncomfortable. But, hey, if water hurt,
sailors wouldn’t go sailing (at least not as often). Check out Chapter 3
for some clothing ideas to stay more comfortable in the inevitable damp-
ness of sailing.
 The instructor doesn’t ride with you. Having the instructor with you is
an option, but some small dinghies get pretty cramped with two people
on board. Often, the instructor follows you in a motorboat, shouting
advice as needed.
Keelboats
Most commercial sailing schools that cater primarily to adults use small (20-
to 28-foot, or 6- to 9-meter) keelboats as their introductory training vessel.
Ideally, the boat has a large, open cockpit area capable of holding a class of
one to four students plus an instructor, as Figure 2-2 shows. A boat that doesn’t
have a cloud of sail area is easier for the neophyte crew to handle.
26
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Pros
Advantages to starting off on a keelboat include the following:
 The instructor and other students are on board. Getting instant feed-
back is nice. Plus, studying with other students on board can be fun.
 You can focus on one skill at a time. On a keelboat with several crew,
one person can drive while another adjusts the sail.
 You won’t capsize. Removing the constant distraction of possibly cap-
sizing enables students to concentrate on sailing.

27
Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools

 They’re more comfortable to sail. On a dinghy, you must pay constant
attention to where you’re sitting in order to keep the boat from tipping
over too far. One of the decisions you have to make when figuring out
how to sail on any boat is where to sit (see Chapter 4). On a keelboat,
however, you don’t affect performance very much if you’re a little slow to
react or are out of position by a foot or two. Plus, keelboats are drier —
although you don’t get any guarantees that a big wave won’t come right
over the side and land on your lap!
 They can use an engine. If the wind dies, or if no wind is in the harbor,
you can start up the engine and make your way to the good sailing water
more quickly.
Cons
If you choose to start your sailing career on a keelboat, remember the follow-
ing disadvantages:
 They’re “duller instruments.” Keelboats are heavier and less respon-
sive to the subtle changes in sail trim and steering that are immediately
apparent on dinghies. This fact can make “feeling” the boat, which is
such an important part of sailing, more difficult.
 Everything pulls harder. The heavier the boat, the bigger the sails and
the more load on all the control ropes. So the boat may be rigged with
devices like winches to provide mechanical advantage.
 They may steer with a wheel. Steering wheels are normally used on
larger (more than 40 feet, or 12 meters, long) keelboats, and some
smaller ones have them too. But tillers provide a much better feel of the
boat and the water flowing past, so you probably have more fun sailing
on a boat with a tiller.
Keeping It Easy the First Time
Here are the ideal conditions for learning to sail, in order of priority:
 Light to medium winds (6 to 12 knots) that are very steady in direc-
tion: For more on wind strength, see Chapter 8.
 Smooth water: Ideally stay in an area protected from surf, swells, and
wind-blown waves.
 An uncrowded, open area with minimal obstructions and room to sail
in any direction: Not having to contend with other boats when you’re
learning can enable you to focus on the task at hand.
 Warm air and water: Air and water temperatures higher than 70 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) are nice; temperatures in the 80s
Fahrenheit (upper 20s to low 30s Celsius) are sheer paradise!
28
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Of course, if you live in Stockholm, you may have to wait a long time for the
air and water temperatures to get that warm. So as long as you dress warmly
(see Chapter 3 for ideas), the key conditions are the first three: light to medium
winds, smooth water, and plenty of room to sail. If the wind is constantly shift-
ing or so light that the sails don’t fill, getting in the groove and feeling what’s
happening can be difficult. In contrast, too much wind is a bad thing for begin-
ners. The waves throw the boat around, the sails flap so loudly that you can’t
hear your instructor, and everything happens way too fast. In short, you have a
very difficult time understanding what’s happening and why.
29
Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools
Sailing for everyone
Thanks to some big developments in assistive
technology, people with all kinds and levels of
disabilities are getting out on the water and
taking sailing lessons. Personal lifts give wheel-
chair users a needed boost from the dock onto
the boat, as the following figure shows. Boats
also have special modifications: “Sip and puff”
systems allow quadriplegics to steer and adjust
the sails, and fiber-optic technology allows even
those individuals with catastrophic disabilities,
such as those on ventilators, to steer and trim
the sails of a boat. Counter-balanced swivel
chairs are available for people with limited
mobility, and talking compasses and GPS sys-
tems allow the sight impaired to navigate. In our
hometown, a nonprofit group, Challenged
America (www.challengedamerica.org),
has trained sailing crews with disabilities who
have competed in distance races like the big
Transpac race from Los Angeles to Hawaii.
Sailing has been a full medal sport in the
Paralympics since 2000. Thanks to many great
organizations around the country that provide
access to the water for the differently abled,
when we say sailing is for everyone and
anyone, we really mean it!

Choosing a Sailing School
Now that we’ve strongly recommended that you start your sailing career with
some lessons, we want you to find the right school. Children and teens may
have some options, such as summer camps and junior programs at clubs,
that aren’t available for adults, so we discuss tips for kids later in this section
in “Picking a sailing school for the kids.”
Exploring your options
If your community has sailboats and sailors, you probably have a choice
between a community sailing program or a commercial sailing school or two.
Yacht clubs, universities, and some charter-boat rental companies may also
offer instruction. Of course, you can always search the Internet for “Sailing
Schools” or look in the Yellow Pages under “Schools” or “Sailing” or “Boating
Instruction.” You can ask a sailor or someone at a marine business for recom-
mendations, and a boat show can be a good source of information too.
In the United States, two organizations oversee national educational pro-
grams that certify instructors and provide schools with curriculum and stan-
dards. You can contact each of them to receive a list of accredited schools.
 The American Sailing Association (ASA): Founded in 1983 (Peter was
one of the founders and remains on the board of directors), the ASA
(phone: 310-822-7171; Internet: www.american-sailing.com) has cer-
tified more than 7,000 sailing instructors and 300,000 students. This edu-
cational system is highly regarded in the field of sailing education, and
major charter-boat companies recognize ASA certification. More than
270 commercial sailing schools are affiliated with the ASA and offer stu-
dent certification to the multilevel ASA program, which begins with
Basic Keelboat Sailing (many accredited schools also offer instruction 
in dinghies).
 US Sailing Association: US Sailing (phone: 800-877-2451; Internet:
www.ussailing.org) is the national governing body for the sport of
sailing. Its primary role for more than a century has been to oversee the
racing side of the sport, including the U.S. Olympic Sailing Team, which
JJ was on in 1992 and 2000. US Sailing is the U.S. representative to the
International Sailing Federation, the organization that produces the
racing rules and represents the sport of sailing in the International
Olympic Committee. US Sailing has long been involved in yacht club
junior-sailing programs due to its focus on racing. More recently, US
Sailing has developed certification systems similar to the ASA’s; its
Keelboat Certification System starts beginners with the Basic Keelboat
standard. US Sailing also has an instructor-certification program.

Taking lessons while on vacation
Why not take sailing lessons during your vacation to an exotic (and warm)
waterfront location? Such vacations are a great way to find the time in your
busy schedule to get out on the water and figure out which way the wind is
blowing. You can use the same sources we mention earlier in this chapter in
“Exploring your options” to find sailing schools at your vacation destination.
Our favorite sailing school in paradise is the Bitter End Yacht Club (www.beyc.
com), a resort in the British Virgin Islands with a large and well-maintained
fleet of boats and well-qualified sailing instructors ready to teach you how to
sail everything from sailboards to dinghies, multihulls to keelboats.
Thousands and thousands of more experienced sailors take sailing vacations
by chartering (renting) boats. We cover that sort of ultimate vacation in
Chapter 17. Many sailboat charter companies offer a more advanced course
designed to introduce an intermediate sailor to the joys of bareboat charter-
ing (chartering a boat “bare” means without hiring a skipper or crew), and
some have programs for beginning sailing courses as well.
Looking outside the United States
Some countries have a national authority like ASA or US Sailing that promotes a
standardized educational system. The International Sailing Federation (www.
isaf.org) provides a list of countries with national entry-level sailing pro-
grams. National sailing organizations should be able to provide you with a list
of accredited schools. You can also find a list of schools at the International
Sailing School Association (www.sailingschool.org). Otherwise, you can
always ask for recommendations from local sailors or marine businesses.
Interviewing a potential school
If you decide to go to a school, you need to pick the right one for you.
Besides asking the obvious question about how much it costs, you want to
find out as much about the prospective school as possible. This short section
provides you with some factors to consider about different sailing schools
during your selection process:
 Curriculum: Does the introductory course offer certification to a
national standard? Don’t settle for an answer like, “Our program is better
than ASA or US Sailing certification,” unless you have some inside info
on the program. Just because a school doesn’t offer certification doesn’t
mean that its course is deficient; the course may be great, but if it doesn’t
comply with some standard other than its own, how do you know? 
31
Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools

Also ask how long the class is. The typical beginners’ course at a com-
mercial sailing school takes place over four days, often two weekends,
and combines classroom and on-the-water training.
 Instructors: Are the instructors certified? If only some of them are, make
sure that your instructor is certified to one of the national standards.
 Boats: What kind of boat does the school use? Dinghy or keelboat?
Wheel or tiller? (Check out Chapter 1 for more information on these boat
specifics.)
 Class size: How many students will be on the boat? Can you take private
lessons? Having other students on the boat with you has advantages and
disadvantages. In order to get enough time at each position, you proba-
bly don’t want more than four students (including yourself) on the aver-
age 25-foot (8-meter) keelboat. The typical dinghy is sailed alone or with
one other student while the instructor follows behind on a powerboat.
 Bad weather/makeup days: How much wind is too much for the entry-
level course? What is the school’s policy for making up blown-out days?
 Safety: Ask about the school’s safety record and any special safety pro-
cedures. Does it have any swimming requirements?
 Equipment: What do you need to bring? Most schools provide life jack-
ets but not foul-weather gear.
 Post-class sailing: Does the school have a boat(s) available for gradu-
ates of the basic sailing course to take out to build sailing experience? If
so, do any special policies apply to its use?
 Higher education: Does the school have further classes that you can
take after you build some experience?
Finding the right sailing instructor
In addition to selecting a potential school, you need to look for the following
desirable features in a beginning sailing instructor. Look for someone who is
 Certified: With certification, you know your instructor has made an
effort to be trained and to measure his skills and knowledge against a
national standard.
 A good teacher: No matter how good a sailor the instructor is, commu-
nication and teaching skills matter most.
 Patient: Instructors need this quality in spades the 50th time someone
asks them to explain something.
32
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

 Congenial: After all, you’re sailing, not doing something serious like tax
preparation. The more fun the students have, the better they can grasp
the key concepts.
 Able to anticipate potential problems: This quality has everything to
do with experience. When the boat is all the way downwind in a narrow
passage with rocks on each side, it’s too late.
 Able to communicate well: Your instructor must be able to make com-
plex things perfectly understandable — sort of like the For Dummies
series of books!
Picking a sailing school for the kids
Many areas have specific programs for kids. They’re most commonly located
at a yacht club, sailing club, or camp, or through some community program,
and are conducted during the summer months. Don’t be put off by the fact
that you’re not a club member, a student at the university, or whatever. Most
private yacht club junior programs welcome nonmembers (thankfully, or
Peter would still be playing baseball today). Check out the registration
process in the winter months to make sure that the class doesn’t fill up
before your child is on the list.
If you find more than one potential program in your area, ask your child to
help make the decision. Nine times out of ten, the best class is with her
friends. I kept sailing mainly because all my friends sailed. If it’s fun, your
child is more likely to stick with it!

Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools
Sailing instruction just for women
Some great T-shirts are available for sailing
couples. Hers says, “Don’t yell at me. I’m doing
the best I can,” and his shirt says, “I’m not
yelling.” If these slogans describe your sailing
relationship, you (assuming you’re a female)
may want to look into sailing instruction specifi-
cally for women. You can find many programs
around the United States. One program run by
Womanship (based in Annapolis, Maryland) has
specific classes for women, including Sail
Yourself Safely Home, a two-day clinic designed
to help a less experienced spouse feel confi-
dent in her ability to get back to shore in case 
of an accident. Mother-daughter classes are
available as well, and Womanship offers
classes around the country as well as instruc-
tional vacations in the Caribbean and Europe.
For more information, contact 800-342-9295 or
www.womanship.com.

Keep the following factors in mind when checking out a youth sailing program:
 Schedule: Some programs run for two months, others in biweekly incre-
ments. Advanced groups may meet in the afternoon and beginners in the
morning. Make sure that you know the number of hours your child will
be sailing per day. What about lunch? Hungry kids don’t learn as well as
kids on a full stomach.
 Type and availability of boats: Find out what type of boat beginners
sail. Do you need to own a boat, or does the club provide one? In some
programs, if you don’t own the boat, you have to crew. Crewing is fine
for intermediate sailing, but beginners need to know how to steer the
boat too.
 Grouping criteria: Most programs divide students into groups by age,
which can create a small problem if your child is starting a few years late
like Peter did. Ask the organizers how they solve this problem.
 Curriculum: Some programs (especially yacht clubs) may stress racing
(which we love) over recreational sailing. This approach is okay, but
having a balance is nice, and the best programs have a high fun factor.
 Instructors: What is the ratio of instructors to students? What certifica-
tions do the instructors have? Often instructors are college students;
find out how many have previous teaching experience. A school rehiring
an instructor for the next season is a good sign.
 Safety: Has the program had any problems in the past? What sort of spe-
cial equipment, safety procedures, and insurance does it have? What are
the age and swimming requirements?
 Equipment: What equipment does your child need? Does the school pro-
vide life jackets, or must you provide your own?
34
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 
Sailing at summer camp
The American Camping Association’s Web site
(www.aca-camps.org) includes a search
feature to help you find camps that offer sailing
instruction. Your child will probably have a great
time keeping cool on the water because any
camps with sailboats are probably located on a
beautiful lake or on the beach.
If you can’t talk your child into a sailing camp,
try finding a camp where your child is exposed
to a wide range of water sports. In our opinion,
any activities around the water are great activ-
ities. An interest in swimming, kayaking, and
canoeing this summer may lead to an interest in
sailing next summer.

Practicing: The More, the Better
After you graduate from your first course in sailing, practice all those new-
found skills and build your experience level. Although many schools offer
classes in higher education, don’t rush it. Spend a season or more just build-
ing your skills before you embark on the next level of education. Your new
skills and knowledge fade quickly if you don’t keep practicing.
We may discourage learning to sail from friends, but after you master the
basic skills in a class, having friends who are sailors is great. Sailboat owners
are often happy to find eager crew. You don’t have to be a lifelong friend; just
let people around the docks know that you’re willing to help with sailing
duties and make a few sandwiches. Crewing for someone more experienced is
a great way to build your own knowledge.
You can also take advantage of the opportunity to try out other types of
boats. If you learned in a keelboat, find someone to take you out on a dinghy,
or vice versa. Sailing different boats can be a great way to expand your hori-
zons, because each boat is different in the way it’s rigged and handled.
Unless you live on a body of water where you just absolutely have to have
your own boat, you probably should rent or borrow boats (if you have gener-
ous friends) for the next phase of your education in the sport. That way, you
can try out different kinds of boats and avoid sinking all your funds into a
boat that may not be right for you. We discuss the considerations involved in
picking out your first boat in Chapter 20.
Many commercial sailing schools also have sailing clubs or charter/rental
operations, and they love to get repeat business from their recent graduates.
Renting is a great way to get sailing time without the joys (and hassles) of
owning a boat. You may even want to hire an instructor for an afternoon just
to refine those basic skills that you’re practicing.
If you’re not one of its students, a boat rental company may want to see proof
of your experience level before it lends you one of its boats, which is one
reason why you want to take your course at a facility that offers national cer-
tification. The rental company may also require one of its staff to check you
out on a particular boat before renting to you, no matter how experienced
you say you are.
Just because you’ve taken one course in sailing doesn’t mean that you’re
ready for an around-the-world cruise. Avoid sailing in wind and sea condi-
tions beyond your ability. These experiences come with time, and now is the
time for gaining confidence in mild conditions.
35
Chapter 2: Knowing Where You Can Learn: Classes and Sailing Schools

Taking Advanced Classes
After you spend a season or so refining your basic sailing skills, you’re ready
to take the next step in your education. If you’re interested in cruising and
recreational sailing aboard keelboats, then you should head to the next levels
of certification, such as those the ASA or US Sailing offers. For example, the
ASA’s progression of keelboat standards is as follows:
 Basic Keelboat Sailing
 Basic Coastal Cruising
 Bareboat Chartering
 Coastal Navigation
 Advanced Coastal Cruising
 Celestial Navigation
 Offshore Passage Making
How far you go within the structure of an educational system depends on
what kind of sailing you want to do and what other opportunities you have
for gaining experience and practical education. After you’ve taken three or so
levels of education over a couple of years, you may be comfortable enough 
to stop there. Or you may enjoy the challenge of moving up the certification
system.
The U.S. Coast Guard may offer classroom courses in your area on subjects
such as safety, seamanship, basic rules of the road, navigation, knots, and
weather. Some of these courses are oriented for powerboaters, but most of
the classroom subjects pertain equally well to sailing. Check out the Web site
(www.uscgboating.org) for details.
If you’re more interested in racing, then you have to find a boat on which you
can race. Spread the word that you’re an eager and willing crew member. We
know of no better way to begin racing than to get out there and do it. For more
on the world of racing sailboats, read Chapter 13. During the off-season, you
may consider taking one of the sailboat-racing classroom courses offered in
your area; find class information through your local sailmakers. We have both
taught at a national racing seminar series called North U. Who knows? Maybe
we’ll see you there!

and What to Bring

F
ace up to the fact that you’re going to get wet on a sailboat. Maybe just a
bit of innocuous spray will come aboard, but at some point, you’re likely
to face a big wave that wants nothing more than to jump down your collar
and soak you and all your clothes. If the water is a 90-degree Fahrenheit (32-
degree Celsius) Gulf Stream soup on a hot day, a douse is welcome. But on a
blustery, cool day, you want to stay as warm and dry as possible — and stay-
ing dry means wearing some sort of waterproof outerwear.
Even more important than staying dry is staying safe. This chapter lists the
essential safety gear to have on board: Item No. 1 is a life jacket. Even if you
can swim the English Channel in your sleep, always make sure that each
person aboard has a life jacket before going sailing. Nowadays you can find
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)–approved life jackets that are comfortable and not
confining. Furthermore, on a wet, windy day, a life jacket can be a welcome
additional layer of clothing!

In addition to selecting the right life jacket, this chapter helps you find the
right clothing as you venture out on the open water and lists necessary
safety equipment. Keep reading so you know everything you need to take
with you before you set foot on a sailboat.
Staying Safe with Life Jackets
The most important safety item you need on a boat is a life jacket. Wearing a
life jacket increases your chances for survival in the water — that’s why they’re
called life jackets. (About 80 percent of boating-related deaths are from drown-
ing.) In the United States, USCG–approved life jackets (called personal flotation
devices, or PFDs) are required on board all boats. How many and what type
depends on the size of your boat and the number of people on board. Keep in
mind the following requirements for the number of life jackets you need:
 For boats shorter than 16 feet (5 meters), USCG regulations require one
wearable life jacket for each person on board.
 For boats longer than 16 feet, you must have one life jacket for each
person plus one throwable flotation device, which must be immediately
accessible. Each life jacket must be USCG approved, in good and service-
able condition, of appropriate size for the intended user, and readily
accessible.
Most boat owners and sailing schools keep the required number of life jack-
ets on board all the time, but you should double-check and ask before you
leave the dock.
Many states have additional regulations. You can get information about the
federal and state requirements at your local marine store or by contacting
the USCG at 800-368-5647 or on the Web at www.uscgboating.org.
If you’re sailing outside the United States, check with the local authorities to
be certain that you’re abiding by their laws; the USCG regulations, however,
are highly respected standards in the international boating community.
Choosing the right jacket
To ensure your safety, you need to wear the right life jacket for you. Life jack-
ets are sized by the weight or chest size of the person intending to wear
them; user chest size or weight information should be clearly marked on the
inside label. The Coast Guard classifies life jackets based upon their use and
performance.
38
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

 Type I is a bulkier jacket that floats the wearer face up even when he or
she is unconscious.
 Type II is shown in the safety icon in this book — this type is quite
common because it’s the cheapest life jacket. It’s safe, just not as com-
fortable as the next type.
 Type III is a comfortable vest that you can easily wear all day. If you’re
going to buy a life jacket for your own personal use, this will likely be the
one — we both own one of these and wear it more than any other type.
They’re best suited for use on dinghies and for day sails on bigger keel-
boats in protected waters.
 Type IV is the throwable life ring or float that you should keep on deck
(on boats longer than 16 feet) to throw to a person in the water.
 Type V is an inflatable life jacket with a compressed air canister. Many
offshore keelboat racers wear this type of life jacket because it’s the
least bulky of all.
Using life jackets correctly
When wearing your life jacket, you want to ensure that it fits properly. You
put on most life jackets like a vest. A snug fit is the most comfortable and
safest, so always zip them up and tighten any adjustment straps. The follow-
ing list provides some important safety tips to help you:
 Always wear a life jacket on a dinghy, because the dinghy can capsize.
 Wear a life jacket on a keelboat any time you feel the conditions warrant it.
 As with all safety equipment, make sure that everyone knows where the
life jackets are stored before you set sail.
 Children, nonswimmers, and anyone requiring extra assistance should
always wear a life jacket on any boat.
 If your life jacket is waterlogged or damaged, replace it.
 Make sure that the life jacket fits, especially for children. Don’t put an
adult’s jacket on a small child — it may slip off in the water. Children’s
life jackets are always sized by their weight.
Children and life jackets
Life jackets don’t guarantee your children’s safety around the water — you
still must watch them vigilantly and know where they are at all times. Making
sure that the life jacket fits properly and that the child feels comfortable wear-
ing it are very important. Most states have regulations that require children
39
Chapter 3: Planning Ahead: What to Wear and What to Bring

under 13 to wear a life jacket when underway unless in an enclosed cabin or
down below deck. For more on sailing with children, see Chapter 16.
Staying Warm + Dry = Having Fun
We recommend that you go sailing several times and find out your favorite
aspect of sailing before you spend money on special sailing gear. Planning
what to wear for a day on the water is similar to preparing for a long hike or
going skiing. You need to consider whether you’ll still be comfortable if you
get damp or wet.
In this section, we assume that you’re not going sailing right after the first
thaw, and we take a look at what clothing you can bring for a typical day sail
in light or moderate winds in the summer months.
Sizing up your sailing wardrobe
Although a wide range of sports-specific clothing is available, you don’t need to
be in any rush to spend large amounts of money as long as you can find cloth-
ing in your current wardrobe that works. After you identify the type of boat and
sailing you prefer, you may consider heading to the marine store. If the speed
and thrills of a sailboard attract you, a wet suit may be your big clothing pur-
chase (see the left photo in Figure 3-1). Or you may decide to go dinghy sailing
and wear the gear shown at center in Figure 3-1. Or you may find that your
greatest love is coastal or offshore keelboat sailing, and you want to invest in
foul-weather gear for wet days (see the right photo in Figure 3-1).

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Ultimately, your clothing depends on three factors:
 The weather
 The water temperature
 The size of the boat
Weather and water temperature considerations are fairly obvious: If you head
out to sail on lovely (and chilly) Lake Ontario in the early springtime, you def-
initely need to bring more layers than your friends who decide to go to Key
West for a “learn-to-sail” summer vacation (they’ll probably get by with a few
T-shirts and swim trunks).
The boat’s size plays a role in deciding what to wear and bring, too. Aboard a
small boat with a centerboard (dinghies and catamarans), you’re very close to
the waves — and when the weather is windy, plenty of spray comes aboard.
Plus, you always have the chance of capsizing and taking an unexpected swim,
so you want to dress to stay warm even if you get wet. On a larger boat, you
sit higher off the water — with the benefit being a drier ride. Also, bigger sail-
boats (keelboats) don’t capsize, so your clothing needs are different.
When I started racing, I didn’t have any special sailing clothing and couldn’t
afford to buy any. Sure, I got soaking wet and cold a few times, but at least I
was out there having fun. Hey, a little water never hurt anyone, especially
when a hot shower and a change of clothes are waiting back on shore.
Layering
When getting dressed to go sailing, keep in mind that the temperature on the
water varies much more than it does on shore. One minute the wind is light,
and you’re basking in the sun with your shirt off; the next minute the wind
comes up across the cool water, and you want your jacket in a hurry.
Bring clothes that you can wear in layers so that you can vary your attire
depending on your comfort needs. Layering is an efficient way to stay toasty
when the air is cold, because the air trapped between the layers warms up
and acts as extra insulation. When the temperature rises, you can strip off
layers until you reach your comfort zone.
Staying dry on top
The best way to keep warm on the water is to stay dry. This advice may
sound pretty basic, but staying dry while on the water requires a little fore-
thought — especially about your top layer. We recommend that your outside
layer be a windbreaker-style jacket.
41
Chapter 3: Planning Ahead: What to Wear and What to Bring

No matter where I go sailing, the first item I pack into my sea bag is a wind-
breaker (with a lining if the weather’s cool). In all but the wettest conditions
(or the tropics), this jacket is my outside layer when sailing.
You probably already have a windbreaker in your closet. Most any nylon-shell
jacket works just fine for 90 percent of your sailing requirements. A wind-
breaker that’s a little oversized is nice, so that you can wear a sweater or a
couple of layers underneath. Good pockets to keep your hands warm (and
that you can zip closed so you can store stuff) are nice features, too.
Preparing Yourself for Getting Wet
Any time you’re sailing a dinghy in summertime conditions expect to get wet.
You have more fun when you aren’t too concerned about staying dry. This
section contains some important clothing tips for dinghy sailing, and many
also apply for keelboat sailing on windy, wet days:
 Bring a towel and a change of clothes and leave them on shore.
Nothing’s worse than having to drive home in wet, salty clothes.
 Consider leaving the gear bag on shore. You probably have only
enough room on board a dinghy for a bottle of water, a tube of sun-
screen, and a jacket (which may get soaking wet, too).
 Leave your cellphone, car keys, and wallet in a safe place on shore,
too. (Don’t ask Peter how many cellphones he’s killed in the water.)
 Wear a bathing suit underneath your clothes. That is, unless your
hobby is being a finalist in wet T-shirt contests.
 Choose wool or modern fabrics instead of cotton. Cotton is great for
keeping you cool on hot days, but it doesn’t retain heat when it’s soak-
ing wet. Wool does a much better job of retaining heat while wet, but
modern polyester fleece materials are the best underlayers when condi-
tions are really wet and chilly, because they wick water away from the
innermost layer so that your skin stays drier.
 Wear the appropriate shoes. Because you’re always sitting down on a
dinghy, the nonskid tread on your shoes is less important than on a keel-
boat. Wet suit booties may be the most comfortable. (Check out “Picking
the Right Shoes,” later in this chapter.)
 Reapply sunscreen often if you’re getting wet. Even supposedly “water-
proof” sunscreens need to be reapplied. While sailing, you can easily get
sunburned because of the double-whammy of the sun’s reflected rays off
the water.
 Don’t forget to wear a life jacket! See “Staying Safe with Life Jackets,”
earlier in this chapter, on why wearing a life jacket is so important.
42
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Choosing Foul-Weather Gear
Whether on a dinghy or a keelboat, if you decide that you really don’t want to
get wet (even in nice weather), you want to make sure you choose the appro-
priate foul-weather gear. When looking for foulies — foul-weather gear —
keep the following points in mind:
 Style: Separate chest-height overalls and a jacket are the most versatile
and warmest combination. (Check out “Layering,” earlier in this chapter,
for the importance of wearing layers.) Plus, the jacket can be a stylish
addition to your shoreside attire. Paddling or kayaking tops with neck
seals that keep water from going down your neck are popular with small-
boat (dinghy and catamaran) sailors, and you can even wear them in
combination with a wet suit. In colder weather, dinghy sailors favor one-
piece dry suits with elastic cuffs at the neck and wrists.
 Material: Many manufacturers offer several different lines of foul-weather
gear. Lighter weight is for active, small-boat racers in temperate condi-
tions, and heavier, “bulletproof” gear is for cold-weather offshore sailing.
If you have to have the best, invest in breathable gear made from a high-
tech fabric that allows water vapor to escape from the inside, minimizing
the clammy feeling you get from most waterproof clothing.
 Room to move: Make sure that you still have a full range of motion, even
with your warmest layers underneath and your life jacket on top.
 Construction: To minimize leakage, make sure that tape seals the seams
on the inside. Look for extra fabric on the seat and knees — these areas
can wear out from the rough deck surfaces on a boat.
 Hood: A built-in hood that you can fold away under the collar is invalu-
able when it starts to rain.
 Pockets: Make sure that the overalls as well as the jacket have pockets —
bigger and more are better.
 Color: Choose bright colors so that you stand out in a crowd — and
especially so that someone can see you if you fall overboard. Avoid
white or blue outerwear, because you may be hard to find in the water.
 Safety: With all this cool gear, don’t forget that you might be wearing it
in the water. Give your attire the float test and jump in a swimming pool
while wearing the maximum cold-weather layered look. The float test
may further encourage you to wear your life jacket.
Picking the Right Shoes
Sailing barefoot may seem like a good way to get in touch with nature, but
running around without shoes is an open invitation for a stubbed toe — or
43
Chapter 3: Planning Ahead: What to Wear and What to Bring

worse. On any bigger boat where you’re going to walk on a wet, slippery
deck, nonslip shoes are required equipment. Pick shoes that are nonmarking,
like the shoes you wear on a tennis or basketball court. You probably own a
pair of sneakers or soft-soled athletic shoes that are fine for your first season
of sailing.
For years, I wore sneakers aboard big race boats because they were so much
more comfortable than leather boating shoes and because they provided
plenty of grip on a slippery foredeck. Then, shoe companies came out with
athletic shoes with a true, nonslip sole made for boating. Now I wear those
shoes until the weather’s so wet that I have to break out my sea boots (high,
waterproof boots).
Some shoe treads work great on boats (we find that soft rubber soles with
plenty of grooves to grip the deck are best). If you find yourself slipping
around the deck in your regular shoes, you may want to buy a pair of special
sailing shoes. You can usually purchase them at a marine store for anywhere
from $50 to $80, depending on what features you want.
Packing What You Need
When going out on the water, you want to make sure you’re prepared. Nothing
is worse than leaving the dock and then having to turn back around after
you’ve forgotten something important. Remember, in a dinghy (or if your keel-
boat looks like a really wet ride), you may want to leave the gear bag ashore.
Use the following checklist to make sure you have everything you need in your
gear bag:
❑A life jacket for each person: (Check out “Staying Safe with Life Jackets,”
earlier in this chapter, for more information.)
❑Jacket or foul-weather gear and/or a bathing suit and wool cap: Now
you have all weather extremes covered.
❑Nonslip, rubber-soled shoes: Don’t go offshore without them. (Refer to
the previous section for the lowdown on picking the right shoes.)
❑Sun stuff — sunglasses, hat, and sunscreen: The glare of sunlight (even
on an overcast day) reflecting off the water and sails makes sun stuff
essential. Make sure that you have a string or some sort of retainer for
your sunglasses and your hat. We’ve proven beyond a doubt that sun-
glasses sink. An extra hat and pair of $5 sunglasses can make you very
popular with your forgetful sailing friends.
44
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

When we’re going to be on the water all day, we put good sunscreen
(SPF 15 or higher) on first thing in the morning, when we brush our
teeth, because sunscreen is most effective when it has time to soak in.
(But be careful not to confuse your sunscreen with your toothpaste.)
Then we reapply sunscreen (everywhere the sun can see us) before
going out on the water, and we try to remember to add another layer a
couple more times during the day.
I always wear a long-sleeved shirt when I sail, and even in the tropics I
wear lightweight, long pants every few days, just to give my skin a rest
from the sun.
❑Gloves: Sailing gloves are a good investment, unless your other hobby is
rock climbing and your hands are well calloused.
❑Hair band: Keep long hair in a ponytail or a braid. Loose hair can get
caught in the lines and blocks and then pulled out in big chunks. (That’s
painful even to think about — ouch!)
❑Water: Drinking plenty of water is crucial on hot days to prevent dehy-
dration, so throw an extra bottle in your bag.
❑Snacks: Having an extra apple or orange (skip the fruit that can get
squashed), a granola bar, or an energy bar can make you pretty popular
if an intended short sail turns into a three-hour tour.
❑Sailor’s choice: We’re divided on this one. On anything but a dinghy, JJ
wants a cellular phone (such a Californian) stored in a plastic bag, but
Peter opts to bring a knife (a sailor’s best friend). Your choice? Fill in 
the blank.
45
Chapter 3: Planning Ahead: What to Wear and What to Bring
When to break out the blue blazer
If someone with a roman numeral in his name
asks you to go sailing with several dozen of his
closest friends on his yacht, chances are good
that the boat is a powerboat, not a sailboat, and
you should wear a blue blazer. Other than that,
you’re rarely expected to wear the traditional
blue blazer on the water. The only times we’ve
ever worn blazers and cocktail party attire on
the water were for a wedding, a boat christen-
ing, or some other really formal party. One top
international sailor we know doesn’t even own
a blue blazer. But before you head off to lunch
at the New York Yacht Club (which, by the way,
is in midtown Manhattan, not on the water),
throw on a coat and tie.
Even at formal parties on large yachts, wear
soft-soled shoes and leave the spike heels at
home. If someone invites you to go sailing on a
fancy yacht, especially an antique wooden
boat, be forewarned that you may be asked to
take off your shoes to prevent damage to the
wooden decks. So make sure that you have
trimmed your toenails (and your date’s —
always more embarrassing) in the last year and
that your socks are presentable.

What to leave on shore
Leave the jewelry at home — you don’t want to lose your grandma’s pearls
overboard. Take off your rings, too, because you have to grip ropes with your
hands, and rings can pinch your fingers (or worse). Any item of clothing or
equipment (such as a camera) that water can ruin should stay on shore. (If
you must bring it, at least put it in a sealed plastic bag.) We say it again —
sailing is a wet sport, and even a big boat can get wet down below.
Stowing your stuff
Carry your extra clothes and spare gear in a small duffel bag or backpack
that closes securely. Ideally, your bag is waterproof — or at least water-
resistant. Leave your nice leather bag or suitcase at home and bring only
what you need — most boats are tight on space. If the boat is big enough to
have a cabin down below deck, go ahead and put your gear bag down there,
preferably off to the side on a bunk or in a cubbyhole so that people don’t
step on it. Make sure your bag is securely wedged in and won’t fall on the
floor (where it can get wet) when the boat heels (leans or tips to one side).
Our final piece of advice for the eternal question of “What should I wear?” is
to ask the people with whom you’re going sailing. They have the best idea of
what gear works well on their boat.
Checking Your Safety List
The following checklist of boating safety equipment is for a typical big keel-
boat around 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) in length, sailing in coastal waters
(not across the ocean, but along it). Starred (*) items we also recommend for
a smaller keelboat or dinghy:
❑Life jackets* (just in case you forgot, they’re USCG–required equipment)
❑Drinking water and food*
❑Sunscreen*
❑Sunglasses, hats, extra clothing*
❑Paddle* (smaller boat only)
❑Sufficient engine fuel and spare parts
❑Binoculars

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

❑Chart
❑Compass*
❑Bucket with a retrieval line (can bail water or be used as an impromptu
toilet)
❑Boat hook
❑All USCG–required equipment for the boat*
❑Sound signals. Usually a whistle* and/or fog horn for larger boats.
❑Fire extinguisher. See Chapter 15 for more on fighting fire on board.
❑Visual distress signals. You can also use signals such as flares or a flash-
light* at night to signal distress by using the international Morse code
“SOS” distress signal (••• — — — •••). And remember spare batteries.
❑Navigation lights. All boats are required to display navigation lights (also
called running lights) at night (including dusk and dawn) and whenever
visibility is reduced (such as in fog, heavy rain, or haze). See Chapter 9
for more on navigation lights and sailing at night.
❑Anchor and anchor rode (chain and line)
❑Extra line (for repairs, heaving, mooring, and anchoring)
❑Fenders
❑VHF radio (see Chapter 7 on using your VHF) and cellphone
❑First-aid kit and manual (see Appendix B and don’t forget any personal
medicines)
❑Tool kit (or a multipurpose tool for a dinghy)*
❑Knife*
❑Lifesling or other man-overboard recovery equipment. For more info,
see Chapter 7.
❑Spare parts for the boat
❑Adequate bilge pump(s)
❑Radar reflector
At most marine stores or any USCG station, you can pick up a copy of the
Federal Requirements and Safety Tips for Recreational Boats pamphlet. The
USCG’s Boating Safety Hotline (800-368-5647) or Web site (www.uscgboating.
org) can provide all sorts of boating safety information, including courses in
your area, and can link you to the Coast Guard Auxiliary and U.S. Power
Squadron, which provides free vessel safety checks.

limbing aboard a sailboat can be trickier than you think, especially on a
small boat. Because you want to maintain your cool image with the crew,
pay close attention to this chapter. When you’re safely aboard (and hopefully
still dry), you need to prepare the boat for sailing. After you complete this
process of rigging the boat, you’re probably ready to hoist (pull up) the sails
and sail away from the dock. However, in some places, such as marinas with
many boats around, you may have to use the engine (if you have one) to
motor your boat out into open water before hoisting the sails and having fun.
Most first-time sailors have a sailing instructor or experienced friend put the
mast up and launch the boat (get it in the water). In this chapter, we assume
that your boat is already launched and tied to a dock or mooring (a perma-
nently anchored buoy). If you have to put up the mast or launch the boat, see
Chapter 6.
In this chapter, we primarily focus on the rigging systems common to a small
(20- to 25-foot or 6- to 8-meter) keelboat — an approach that provides an
excellent general introduction to the different components involved in the
rigging process, no matter what boat you sail. However, every boat is differ-
ent, and yours may have some steps to rigging that are peculiar to its type.
That’s why we recommend that you rig the boat with an instructor or some-
one who knows the boat.

Dissecting a Sailboat: This Part 
and That Part
Before you climb aboard and rig your boat, we need to briefly introduce you
to the names of the parts of a sailboat. Take a closer look at the two basic
types of sailboats we discuss in this book — keelboats and dinghies — in
Figures 4-1 and 4-2 to see most of these parts (many are common to both
keelboats and dinghies).

All sailboats are different, so we can’t guarantee your boat has all (or only)
the following parts, but this list is a start. This section isn’t one of those mis-
sion descriptions on Mission: Impossible that self-destructs after the first
reading. You can always come back and brush up on your terminology.
The following are the parts of a dinghy:
 Mast: The vertical pole that supports the sails.
 Boom: The horizontal pole that supports the bottom edge of the main-
sail. The boom swings from side to side as the boat turns, so be careful
not to get in the boom’s way as it swings, or else . . . boom!
 Tiller: A lever arm that turns the rudder (thereby steering the boat);
commonly found on smaller boats (instead of a steering wheel).
 Wheel: On larger boats, the steering wheel that controls the position of
the rudder.
 Bow: The front of the boat. The direction toward the bow is forward.
 Stern: The back of the boat. The direction toward the stern (the oppo-
site of forward) is aft.
 Cockpit: The area where the crew sits to operate the boat.
 Deck: The top of the hull.
 Hull: The floating part or body of the boat.
 Lifelines: Safety line or coated wire that runs around the deck.
 Stanchion: Metal poles around the perimeter of the deck that support
the lifelines.
 Backstay: The support wire that runs from the mast down to the stern.
 Forestay: The support wire that runs from the mast down to the bow.
Also called the headstay.
 Shrouds: The support wires that run from the mast down to the edge of
the middle of the deck on either side. Sometimes called sidestays.
 Topsides: The outer sides of the hull above the waterline.
 Transom: The outer sides of the stern.
 Beam: The width of the boat at any point. The maximum beam is the
widest point.
 Waterline: The water level on the hull.
 Draft: Also referred to as draught, the distance from the water’s surface
to the deepest point on the boat. You can also refer to the draft by the
verb draw, as in “Our boat draws 7 feet.”
 Freeboard: The distance between the deck of the boat and the water.

Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Climbing Aboard
Just as different boats can have different parts, how you climb aboard differs
depending on the boat type. This section has tips for boarding all kinds of
boats. We start with the tippier boats — dinghies — and then cover how to
climb on a bigger keelboat.
Climbing aboard a dinghy
Dinghies, as we explain in Chapter 1, are smaller boats (usually under 20 feet,
or 6 meters) that carry no ballast (weight) in their movable centerboard (under-
water fin). Dinghies can also tip over. Because with this book we want you to
master sailing and not swimming, make sure that your first step into a dinghy is
as near to its centerline (an imaginary line that runs down the center of the
boat from end to end) as possible, near the midpoint from bow to stern (front
to back). (If you’re not careful, you may tip the boat and end up in the water.)

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

If the dinghy has wire rigging (shrouds) connecting the mast (near or at its
top) to the right and left sides of the boat for support, you may want to
gently hold on for balance and to keep the boat near you as you step on
board. You may also want to consider starting from a sitting or crouching
position on the dock. In any case, keep your weight as low and close to the
centerline as possible as you step aboard, as Figure 4-3 shows.
Putting the centerboard, daggerboard, or leeboard down all the way
increases the boat’s stability, which makes moving around the boat much
easier. Therefore, putting down the fin is the first thing you should do after
you climb aboard.
The boat becomes much more stable when it’s moving and the pressure of
the wind is in the sails. But until you’re sailing, keep your weight as low and
near the centerline as possible as you rig the boat.
Climbing onto a keelboat
Although keelboats have more stability than dinghies, due to their ballasted
keel fin, keelboats can be tricky to board, too. The bigger the boat, the higher
the freeboard, or distance between the boat’s deck and the water. Bigger (more
than 25 feet, or 8 meters) keelboats usually have lifelines, a wire perimeter
around the deck supported by metal poles called stanchions. Lifelines help the
crew stay on board, but they can be tricky to climb over when boarding.
Figure 4-3:
JJ shows
how to stay
dry while

53
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Some small keelboats don’t have lifelines, so you can use the same tech-
niques as we outline for dinghies to climb aboard small keelboats. However,
boarding a larger keelboat with lifelines from a dock near water level requires
different methods. Maybe some stairs lead from the dock up to an open gate
in the lifelines, making you feel like you’re boarding the Queen Mary. Or, on
some boats, an open transom (back end) makes boarding a breeze. But if you
must navigate up and over lifelines, try to grab a shroud with one hand and
then step up on deck and swing one leg over the lifelines, sort of like mount-
ing a horse, as Figure 4-4 shows.
Now you know why we suggest in Chapter 3 that you carry your gear in a 
bag — so that you can easily hand it to someone on board or throw it into 
the cockpit (the inside of the boat, where the crew sits). You need both hands
free for climbing onto the boat.
Grab the shroud (if you can reach it) for support; a lifeline or stanchion may
not be strong enough to support your weight.
If you’re not so athletically inclined, and the lifelines don’t have a gate or the
transom doesn’t have an opening to facilitate your entrance, you can always
crawl through the lifelines. Your ego can survive having to crawl on board
better than being left at the dock.
Rigging the Boat
You rig, or prepare, the boat for sailing by attaching all the necessary parts,
including the sails. The best way to find out how to rig a boat is to watch
someone else rig it and then try to rig it yourself next time.
Figure 4-4:
Peter climbs
over the
lifelines on a

54
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Until you’re more experienced, always check with your instructor or a knowl-
edgeable sailor to make sure that you rigged everything properly before
hoisting the sails.
Even when Peter and I go sailing on a new boat, we always end up asking the
owner at least a couple of questions about rigging the boat — questions such
as which line to rig where. (Of course, I’m better about asking questions than
Peter — just like in our car, he never asks for directions, no matter how lost
we are.)
Preparing the sails
As we discuss the process of rigging sails, keep in mind that many variations
are possible. For example, on some boats you store the mainsail (folded, or
furled) on the boom, under a cover to protect it from the sun. In this case,
take the cover off and skip to the “Preparing the mainsail” section, later in
this chapter.
Each part of a sail has a name, too. Check out the following list for a brief def-
inition of the terms in Figure 4-5:
 Head: The top corner of a sail
 Tack: The front, bottom corner of a sail
 Clew: The back, bottom corner of a sail
 Foot: The bottom edge of a sail
 Leech: The back edge of a sail
 Luff: The front edge of a sail
Note: Like a few other words in the sailor’s dictionary, luff has multiple
meanings — see the sidebar.
 Battens: Solid slats inserted into pockets along a sail’s leech to help
maintain its shape
55
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock
Sometimes it’s a luffing matter
One of the most common words in sailing is luff.
The problem for a beginning sailor is that this
word has multiple meanings. The forward edge
of a sail is called the luff. That’s the noun. The
verb to luff defines the flapping motion of 
sailcloth when a sail is undertrimmed (or not
trimmed at all). Luffing is also an adjective, as in
“A sailboat with luffing sails can’t generate any
power.” Got it?

Sailors also use specific names for the lines (ropes with a purpose) used 
to control the sails. Here are the most common sail controls as shown in
Figure 4-6:
 Cunningham: The control line system near the tack of a sail used to
adjust luff tension.
 Halyard: The rope running up the mast used to pull the sail up.
 Outhaul: The control line system (mounted on the boom) used for con-
trolling the tension of the foot of the mainsail.
 Traveler: A sail control system that can move the mainsheet attachment
point on the boat from side to side.
 Boom vang: The control line system running from the boom to the mast
that tensions the leech of the mainsail.
To adjust those ropes, your boat has the following equipment:
 Block: A pulley that provides a mechanical advantage to make it easier
to pull a rope.
 Cleat: A fitting used to tie off or secure a line so that it doesn’t slip.
 Winch: Larger boats have at least one winch, a revolving drum that
increases the sailor’s power to pull on a rope. (See more about pulling
pulleys and using winches at the end of Chapter 5.)

Don’t think that you have to memorize all these terms before stepping on a
sailboat. Just look them over and acquaint yourself with them, and then put
on your sunscreen and get your sails ready.
Preparing the mainsail
The first sail to prepare is the mainsail. You may need to take the sail out of
its bag and lay it on the deck lengthwise, still in its folded state, with the lead-
ing edge toward the front. Follow these steps to prepare the mainsail:
1. Insert the battens.
Start by checking to see whether the mainsail has empty batten pockets.
Battens are wood or fiberglass slats that slide into pockets on the sail’s
back edge, or leech, as Figure 4-7 shows. Battens help the sail project its
designed airfoil shape and protect it from excessive flapping.
If one end of the batten is more flexible, insert that end first.
Make sure the battens are secure, so that they don’t slide out of their
pockets when the sails luff (flap). Sailmakers use many different sys-
tems, such as ties or Velcro, to keep the battens in place.

2. Slide in the foot.
If you have a loose-footed mainsail that only attaches to the boom at the
corners, you can skip this step and go straight to Step 3.
If the foot, or bottom edge, of your sail has a rope (sometimes covered by
fabric) sewn onto it, then you need to slide the foot of the sail into the
track or groove on the top of the boom. Start at the clew (the sail’s lower
back corner) and slide the sail all the way down the boom from front to
back, as Figure 4-8 shows. This process usually takes two people — one
to feed the rope into the track and the other to hold the sail and help
slide it along. Instead of a foot rope, some mainsails have many small
plastic or metal slides attached along the foot that you insert into the
groove on the boom, similar to the foot rope.
3. Attach the tack.
The tack (bottom front corner) of the mainsail usually attaches to a 
fitting at the front of the boom or to the gooseneck (the fitting that
attaches the boom to the mast), as Figure 4-9 shows. Preparing the main-
sail is starting to sound like “. . . your hip bone attaches to your thigh
bone. . . .” But stay with us; it all makes sense when you put it together.
All three corners of the sail have a grommet or a strap loop to enable 
you to attach them to the proper control lines or fittings. A grommet is 
a plastic or metal ring built into a sail, as Figure 4-9 shows. Quite com-
monly, you use a shackle (a closed metal hook) to connect one or more
of the corners to the appropriate fitting. (See Chapter 19 to find out how
to tie a bowline, the best knot to use when tying a line to a sail.)

4. Attach the clew.
Next, attach (usually with a shackle) the clew to the outhaul at the end
of the boom. The outhaul is the control line system, found at the back of
the boom, that tensions the mainsail’s foot.
You can launch some smaller dinghies (usually shorter than 16 feet, or 
5 meters) with the mainsail already hoisted and luffing (flapping). With
these boats, attaching the clew is the last thing you do before leaving
the dock. But on most boats, attaching the bottom corners of the main-
sail (the tack and the clew) before you hoist is easiest. After you attach
the clew to the outhaul, pull the outhaul rope snug and secure it.
5. Attach the halyard.
To hoist the sail to the top of the mast, you use a halyard. A halyard is a
rope or wire attached to the top corner (head) of the sail that’s rigged 
to let you raise the sail to the top of the mast from cockpit level.
Before attaching the halyard, pull it taut and look up, following the line
all the way to the top of the mast. Unwind any wraps or tangles before
attaching the halyard to the sail. The halyard attaches to the head of the
sail by a shackle or a rope knot, preferably a bowline. You can read all
about knots in Chapter 19.
Always make sure that the halyard is securely attached. Use pliers to
tighten a shackle with a screw pin or make sure your bowline is secure.
6. Prefeed the luff of the main.
No, the luff (the front edge of the sail) isn’t a hungry animal. To feed the
luff means to slide the top end of the luff (usually a rope) into the groove
in the back edge of the mast just above the boom — just like we explain
with the foot of the sail. On some boats, you feed the first foot or two 
of the top of the sail into the mast well before hoisting. On others, you
leave the halyard off, keeping the head of the sail down on deck or tied
up on the boom, and wait until it’s time to hoist.
Preparing the jib
If your boat has a jib, this section can help you prepare to hoist this forward-
most sail. (A genoa is a large jib. To be perfectly accurate, calling a genoa a jib
is okay, but calling a small jib [one that doesn’t overlap the mast] a genoa is
wrong. For simplicity, we always use the term jib.) Follow these steps when
preparing your jib:
1. Take the jib out of its bag. Set it down on the foredeck lengthwise, with
the front edge toward the bow.
Jibs are attached at the three corners (fortunately, they share the names
head, tack, and clew with the mainsail), plus along the front edge (luff).
60
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

2. Attach the tack to the fitting near the bow.
Usually you use a shackle for this job.
3. Prepare the luff for hoisting.
The system for attaching the jib to the forestay (a support wire from the
mast running down to the bow, also called the headstay) can vary. Some
sails attach with snaps or clips (hanks) located at intervals along the 
luff of the sail. Others have a luff tape, similar to the foot and luff ropes
in a mainsail, which slides into a special, grooved channel built into, or
attached onto, the forestay. With this system, one person must feed the
tape as another hoists the sail. On a jib with hanks, you clip them onto
the forestay (starting at the bottom and working upward) without hoist-
ing the sail, as Figure 4-10 shows.
4. Attach the halyard to the top of the jib.
As with the main halyard, pull the jib halyard taut and look up to ensure
that it isn’t twisted.
5. Attach the jib sheets, ensuring that they’re fed through the proper
blocks (pulleys) and cleats on each side of the boat.
Many different jib sheet systems are available. A bowline (there’s that
knot again; check out Chapter 19) or a shackle may attach the sheets
(there are two — one for each side) to the sail. The sheets are then run
back to the cockpit, where the crew controls them. You must rig jib
sheets through a specific path that may include passing through several
pulleys. Figure 4-11 shows the jib sheet system on a typical dinghy.
Figure 4-10:
This jib is
ready to
hoist, with
the snaps
attached to
the forestay.
61
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

6. Secure the jib.
You don’t want it to blow into the water before hoisting, but you must
keep it out of the way on deck so you don’t slip on it. So do whatever
works best: You may just pull it tightly along one side of the deck with a
jib sheet or lash it down, but try to avoid crumpling the sail cloth or
you’ll shorten the life of the sail.
Double-checking before hoisting the sails
Before you hoist the sails, check that everything is ready for you to leave 
the dock. When you hoist the sails, they begin to flap in the wind — which,
although safe, isn’t very seamanlike, because the flapping puts extra wear on
the sails. Therefore, you want to get sailing as quickly as possible after hoist-
ing. Use the following list to make sure that you’re ready to go:
 The boat is in a good position to depart and is pointing “into” the
wind. Trying to raise the mainsail before pointing the bow of the boat
toward the wind is a common mistake of new sailors. If the boat isn’t
pointed into the wind, raising the mainsail may be impossible, because
the wind fills the sail when it’s partway up, putting too much load on 
the halyard. After you determine where the wind is coming from (see
Chapter 5), think about where you can put your boat so that it points
into the wind. A boat secured only at the bow naturally points into the
wind (unless affected by strong current). Also look around and plan the
path you’ll take to sail away from the dock.
 The control lines — especially the main and jib sheets — are properly
rigged and have plenty of slack. Make sure the main and jib sheets are
uncleated too.

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

 Everybody is on board. Also ensure that everyone knows where to be for
getting under way (check out “Knowing where the crew should sit,” later
in this chapter) and what their special tasks are (trimming sails, storing
fenders and dock lines, getting the skipper a cold drink, and so on).
 Life jackets and safety gear are handy. Check out Chapter 3 for more on
the importance of life jackets.
 Loose gear is stowed. Make sure all bags are put below out of the way
and where they will (hopefully) stay dry. Extra hats or jackets should be
put away so they don’t blow overboard.
 Main and jib are properly rigged and ready to hoist. Take an extra look
to make sure the halyard isn’t twisted.
 The rudder (and centerboard if your boat has one) is down and
secured. Secure the rudder so that it stays with the boat if you capsize.
Most dinghy rudders have a spring clip or tie-down line to keep them
from sliding out if the boat flips. For dinghies with daggerboards, use a
restraining line (a shock cord works well) that lets you adjust the dagger-
board up and down but keeps it attached to the boat in case of a capsize.
 You have proper clothing and sunscreen on. Even if you applied sun-
screen in the morning, reapply it now.
Before hoisting, make sure enough open water is around so that you can sail
away easily. Nothing’s more embarrassing than casting off from the dock only
to smash right into an adjacent boat. With this warning in mind, you may
want to walk your boat down the dock or beach to a less crowded location
before hoisting — or if your boat has an engine, you may want to power to 
an open area before hoisting sails.
Raising the Sails
Now you’re ready to raise the sails. The general rule is to hoist the mainsail
first, although there are some definite exceptions:
 If the dock is oriented in such a way that you can’t point the boat into
the wind, you may want to hoist the jib first and then sail downwind to
an area where you can point the bow toward the wind and raise the
mainsail. This maneuver is tricky, though, so don’t try it without an
instructor or experienced sailor on board.
 On some dinghies, you must hoist the jib first, because the tension of
the jib halyard keeps the mast secure in the boat.
Most of the time, you can get under way with just the mainsail, saving the
excitement and extra responsibility involved with using the jib for later.
63
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Hoisting the mainsail
As we say earlier in the “Preparing the mainsail” section, you must feed the
mainsail luff (usually a covered rope or slides) into the mast for hoisting.
Unless you’re vigilant, the luff invariably gets pinched and stuck as you hoist.
On a dinghy, you may have to feed the luff in yourself as you hoist. On a
bigger keelboat, assign one person to stand next to the mast to feed the luff
into the groove, as Figure 4-12 shows. Someone else (and, if need be, a third
person) can then slowly and steadily pull up the halyard.
Hoisting the mainsail with a winch
Boats more than 25 feet (8 meters) long may have a winch to help pull up the
halyards. A winch is a revolving drum that mechanically increases the sailor’s
power to pull on a rope. See Chapter 5 on how to use a winch.
To raise the main halyard by using a winch, start by putting a couple wraps of
the halyard line in a clockwise direction around the winch drum. You want
just enough wraps to enable you to hold the line without it slipping. As the
load increases (when the sail is partway up), you need to add a wrap or two.

64
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Even with a winch, the easiest way to hoist a sail on a bigger boat is usually
by jumping (pulling on) the halyard at the mast. Have a crew member (the
jumper) stand at the mast where the halyard exits (presumably above the
jumper’s head — otherwise jumping doesn’t work). Now he has great
mechanical advantage to pull downward on the halyard. As he pulls, another
person in the cockpit takes up the slack in the halyard by pulling the halyard
that’s wrapped around the winch. When the sail nears the top, the load may
increase so much that jumping is inefficient. Then you must grind (rotate) the
winch by turning the winch handle (a metal arm placed in the top of the
winch) until the sail is up to the top. Pulling the halyard away from the mast
like a bow string can also increase your mechanical advantage.

Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock
You just have to be different, don’t you?
Some boats have the jib permanently rigged on
a roller furler, so the jib stays hoisted and rolled
up around the forestay even at the dock, as the
photo in this sidebar shows. To unfurl the jib, all
you have to do is pull on one line!
Some boats (including sailboards) don’t even
have a main halyard. The mainsail on these
boats has a sleeve running along the luff that
slides onto the mast like a glove slides onto a
finger. Then you attach the mast and sail into the
boat together. Chapter 6 covers putting a mast
up, and Chapter 18 covers rigging sailboards.

Avoiding certain mistakes
When hoisting a mainsail, you want to stay clear of a few important mistakes
that can cause havoc and put a damper on your day at sea. The most common
problems when hoisting sails include
 Getting the luff rope jammed, which makes the halyard impossible to
pull. If the luff jams, stop pulling the halyard and ease it until the person
feeding the sail at the mast can clear the jam and prepare the sail to
slide up cleanly again. If you’re hoisting the halyard, watch the area
where the sail is feeding into the mast so that you know when a problem
is about to happen.
 Failing to ensure that the mainsheet (the sail adjustment rope attached
to the boom) has plenty of slack in it and isn’t cleated. If the mainsheet
doesn’t have enough slack, the sail can fill when it’s partway up, a real
drag for the person doing the hoisting. Free the cunningham and boom
vang to facilitate hoisting. (See Chapter 12 to discover how these control
lines affect sail shape.) If the halyard starts getting really hard to pull,
stop and look up — it may be caught on something up high or may not
have been led correctly.
 Forgetting a step such as attaching the halyard to the head of the sail.
This common (and embarrassing) mistake is sometimes tough to remedy.
On small dinghies, you can tip the boat over at the dock to retrieve the
errant halyard, but on big boats, you have to climb or hoist someone up
the mast to retrieve the lost halyard. (For more on doing the high-wire
act up in the rigging, see Chapter 15.)
How high is high enough?
How high should you pull the sail? All the way! The amount of tension you
need for optimum sail shape varies (see Chapter 12), but in general, pull the
sail up until the sailcloth is taut and just barely begins to show vertical lines
of tension when luffing. The windier it is, the more tension you want. The
visual aid is the tension in the luff, as Figure 4-13 shows. In the photo on the
right, the mainsail is too low — note all the wrinkles along the luff and the
gap at the bottom of the mast. In the left photo, the mainsail halyard tension
is too tight — note the vertical strain marks just behind the mast.
Cleating off the halyard
After you have the mainsail hoisted properly, you need to make sure your hal-
yard doesn’t slip. Secure it with one of the following fittings:
 Horn cleat (also called a t-cleat): A common cleat (fitting that firmly
holds a rope under load) for halyards on dinghies and smaller keelboats.
These are simple fittings with no moving parts to break or malfunction. 
66
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

To secure a line around one of these cleats, put one complete wrap of
rope around the base. This wrap provides friction to keep the line from
slipping when cleating or uncleating. Then make a figure eight and finish
by twisting it to create a hitch on the final turn so that the end is under-
neath (see Chapter 19 for tying a cleat knot).
 Jammer or rope clutches: Mechanical fittings with a lever arm that
“squish” a rope so tight that it can’t slip, even under an intense load
(check out Figure 4-14). They’re especially common on larger boats,
where the loads on ropes are higher. Most jammers enable you to pull
the line in when it’s closed, but you can’t ease it out. Keep the jammer
open as you hoist the mainsail so that you can quickly ease the halyard
if the sail gets pinched at the feeding point. When the sail is up and the
luff is properly tensioned, you simply pull the jammer’s lever down to
cleat the halyard in position.
Before opening a jammer holding a rope under load, be very careful. Put a
few wraps around a winch and then pull snug to take up the tension on the
rope behind the jammer so that the rope doesn’t burn your hands when it
eases out.

Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Hoisting the jib
Hoisting the jib is similar in many ways to hoisting the main. On small boats,
you can hoist the jib while your boat is still tied to the dock and pointed into
the wind. Make sure the jib sheets are fully slackened so that the sail can luff
freely (and doesn’t fill) while being hoisted. You can also hoist your jib while
sailing — just make sure the jib sheets are free to run so the sail doesn’t fill.
Hoisting a big, overlapping jib (called a genoa) on a keelboat is best done while
sailing downwind (see Chapter 5 for the points of sail), because if you hoist it
while pointing into the wind, it flaps against the mast as you hoist. Plus, by
hoisting a genoa while going away from the wind direction, as Figure 4-15
shows, the mainsail protects it from the force of the wind. This system works
equally well even if you have only a smaller jib. After the sail is hoisted, save
your crew’s strength by letting them pull the jib sheet in and cleat it before you
turn to your course.
Any time you sail downwind, be careful not to jibe by mistake. If you do,
someone could get hurt by the boom (see the “Avoiding danger areas” sec-
tion at the end of this chapter and find out more about jibing in Chapter 5).
If your jib has a luff rope or tape, a crew member may need to stand on the
bow to feed the luff tape into the groove of the headstay. If your jib has hanks
(metal clips) or snaps, then you don’t need anyone on the bow, because
those clips are attached during the rigging process.

Cleaning up all that rope
After you’ve hoisted (raised) your sails, you need to clean up all that spaghetti
of rope you create while rigging. Some sailboats have a daunting number of
sail control ropes, and ropes left to their own devices have an amazing capa-
bility to knot themselves.
As Murphy’s Law suggests, after you’re sailing, the line that you absolutely
have to let out now is in a huge knotted mess with every other line on board,
including your shoelaces. A good sailor takes the time and effort to clean up
the mess and make the ropes as neat as possible. As you see in Chapter 5,
Wind

and pointing

69
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

keeping lines neat is important from a safety standpoint, too, because being
able to let out the mainsheet quickly when a big puff hits can keep you from
capsizing.
After you’re sailing, you don’t commonly adjust certain ropes, such as the
halyards, so you can put them away so that they don’t tangle with the ropes
you need to trim (pull in) the sails. You may feed the halyard into a storage
bag or coil it in a convenient out-of-the-way area, depending on the boat. To
use a bag, start at the very end and neatly feed the halyard into the bag so
that it can come out just the way you put it in — with no tangles!
If you don’t have a bag for the halyard, coil it, starting a foot or two from its
cleat. When you finish coiling, put your hand through the coil and pull part of
the line closest to the cleat through the coil, twist it a few times, and loop it
over the cleat, as the photo in Figure 4-16 shows, so that you can easily undo
the coil.
Never tie off a coiled halyard in a way that you can’t immediately release it 
to run freely; you never know when you’ll want to lower a sail quickly in an
emergency.
Other lines (such as dock lines) that should be put away before sailing are
coiled by a different method. Start at one end and make loops of equal size
(usually about 3 feet, or 1 meter, in diameter) until you get near the other
end. When you have about 5 feet (11⁄2 meters) left, make three or four tight
loops around the “throat” at one end of the coils. Then take the doubled end
through the top of the coil and pass it over the top as the right drawing in
Figure 4-16 shows.

Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

Sitting at the Dock on the Bay
After you hoist the sails, but before you leave the dock, the sails luff (flap) 
in the wind. This flapping is noisy, the boom is swinging back and forth just
above your head, and you don’t have a clue what to do next. Don’t panic. Just
sit low enough that the boom doesn’t hit you as it swings through its arc, and
take a deep breath. You need to feel comfortable with luffing, because you
find yourself in this position quite often when you’re beginning to sail.
A luffing sail flaps because the wind is blowing straight along its surface from
front to back. Just like a flag, a luffing sail shows you the wind direction. After
you read Chapter 5, you’ll know how to trim in a sail (by pulling on the main-
sheet rope — or the jib sheet rope, as the case may be) to make it stop luff-
ing; you’re forcing the sail to lie at an angle to the wind and therefore “fill”
with wind. (But if you’re in the no-sail zone, your sails luff even if you trim
them in.)
When your sails are fully luffing, they don’t have any power, so the boat slows
down and ultimately coasts to a stop. Luffing sails, then, are your brakes. You
apply your “sea brake” by simply letting the sheet out.
Steering (And Riding in) the Boat
All sailboats have a rudder, an underwater movable fin that turns the boat.
This rudder is attached to either a long stick (tiller) or a wheel that you use
to steer. In this section, we explain the differences between tiller and wheel
steering systems. We also cover where to sit when you drive or crew (on a
sailboat, the driver’s seat isn’t always obvious; it can change when the wind
changes) as well as areas to steer clear of when on a sailboat.
Tiller or wheel?
Most sailboats longer than 30 feet (9 meters) are steered with a wheel, just
like a car. Through a mechanical linkage, the wheel controls the position of
your rudder. When moving forward, turn the wheel left and the boat goes to
the left — and vice versa. You may think that we’re stating the obvious, but
you see why when you compare turning the wheel to the other way of steer-
ing a sailboat — with a tiller.
You steer most smaller sailboats by using a tiller. Using a tiller for the first
time takes a bit of getting used to, because the boat turns the opposite direc-
tion you move the tiller. If you move the tiller to the left, the boat turns right;
move the tiller right, and the boat goes left, as Figure 4-17 shows.
71
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Steering a sailboat is also like a car in that turning becomes more efficient the
faster the boat is going (and in the fact that you can’t steer when stopped).
So when you’re going fast, you can turn the tiller or wheel less to achieve the
same turning arc. To turn when you’re going slow, turn harder and keep the
rudder over for a longer time.
For pure sailing pleasure, I prefer a tiller on any boat up to, say, 40 feet (12
meters). Although a wheel takes up less cockpit space, it compromises the
feel of the boat. Because of all the associated parts and connections, wheel
steering has much more internal friction. A tiller directly connects you to the
rudder, allowing you to feel the water as it flows below the boat, and for me,
that sensitivity is preferable.

“Take the helm, Mr. Sulu”
Although you can refer to the person steering a
boat as the “driver,” you also hear terms like
skipper and helmsman (or helmswoman). Helm
is another sailing term with multiple meanings.
The helm is the rudder or tiller — the steering
device. It’s also the role of the helmsman on the
boat. Helm is also a technical word (refer to
Chapter 11) for describing the balance of your
boat’s rudder when sailing.

Knowing where to sit when you drive
One of the easiest ways to spot nonsailors is to see where they sit on a boat.
If you’re driving, you not only want to be able to steer well, but you also want
to look good. The following tips can help:
 When steering a dinghy, keep in mind the effect your weight has on
the balance of the boat. Not only should you sit down, but the windward
side (the side the wind blows on) most likely needs your weight to coun-
teract the heeling (tipping) forces of the sails. (In Chapters 11 and 12, we
discuss techniques for limiting heel.)
 Sit just forward of the end of the tiller so that you can freely move 
it from side to side. Most boats have a tiller extension or hiking stick
attached to the end of the tiller that enables you to sit farther out to the
side of the boat while steering. Using this extension all the time enables
you to sit comfortably while steering — and look cool. Hold the tiller
extension in your aft hand so that your forward hand is free to adjust
the mainsheet, as Figure 4-18 shows. You also have a better view of the
sails on a boat with a jib if you sit farther forward.
 On keelboats with a wheel, stand or sit behind or to either side of the
wheel. On keelboats with a tiller, sit on either side, wherever you have
the most visibility and feel most comfortable — although keeping your
weight on the high side to counteract heeling is important on a smaller
keelboat.
 If your boat has a blind spot because of a cabin top or the sails, move
around occasionally to peek into the blind spot. Periodically asking 
a crew member to look for obstructions and other boats never hurts
either. It’s your responsibility to be aware of everything that may pose 
a danger to your boat at all times.

Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

Knowing where the crew should sit
On most boats, the crew sits forward of the skipper. The crew members often
are responsible for trimming the sails and moving their weight outboard
(hiking) to keep the boat from heeling. In most conditions, they can sit on the
windward side. But if the wind is very light or if the boat’s sailing downwind,
they may need to sit on the side opposite the skipper to help balance the boat.
On larger boats with several crew members, divide up the jobs so that every-
one can feel useful. The skipper usually steers (although nothing says you
can’t trade around and share the joys of being at the helm). In Chapter 12,
you find out about other sail-handling jobs for the crew. As the boats get
bigger, your individual weight makes less of a difference in counteracting the
heeling forces, but you’ll still find staying on the windward side most com-
fortable, whether operating the boat or just hanging out.
Avoiding danger areas
Certain spots on a boat are safer than others. Before you leave the dock, make
sure you know what spots to avoid (or at least be extra careful in) after you’re
under way. These danger areas include
 Anywhere in the plane of the boom when it swings across in a jibe or
tack. Don’t forget to duck! Along with the boom, be aware of all the asso-
ciated rigging, including the boom vang and the mainsheet.
 Anywhere outside of the cockpit where you walk or stand. Many 
boats have handrails that make it easier to hold on if you must leave 
the cockpit.
 At the bow and the stern. If you must go to these places, hold on tight,
because the motion of the boat is accentuated at the ends.
 In the path of the jib and jib sheets during a tacking maneuver. This
path runs from the foredeck all the way back on either side to where 
the jib sheets go through pulleys heading for the cockpit. During a tack
(or jibe), when the headsail flaps in the wind, the sailcloth and ropes are
like whips.
 In the “slingshot target zone” of pulleys under high load. If the block
were to break loose, it would go flying.
 On the leeward side of the boat. The leeward, or downwind, side is
especially dangerous if the boat is heeling (leaning from the wind); the
leeward side is closer to the water, and gravity is pushing you that way.
74
Part I: Before You Get Your Feet Wet 

 Shiny areas, such as varnished wood or plastic hatch covers. Shiny
areas are probably as slippery as they look. Most bigger boats have a
nonskid (textured) surface on deck to help keep you steady, but look
where you step and hold onto something if you can. Sails on deck are
also very slippery.
Yes, you figured it out — the safest place in most boats is the cockpit (as long
as you stay low and watch out for the darn boom). Check out Figure 4-1 to
identify where the cockpit is on a basic keelboat. The deck can be dangerous
during maneuvers or in rough seas at any time.
Avoiding Collisions: Rules of the Road
Before you actually set sail and leave the dock, you need to know how to
avoid collisions with other boats. Hey, your driver’s education teacher didn’t
let you drive before you knew the basic rules of the road! In bigger harbors,
your main concern is staying out of the way of commercial vessels: barges,
tugboats, and big ships.
The following are some basic concepts to help you when your course takes
you near large vessels:
 Be very careful around tugboats and barges. Sometimes the towing
cable (which can be several hundred yards long) between a tug and a
barge submerges, creating the false appearance of a safe passageway.
 Large ships and tugboats pushing barges can have a “blind spot” that
extends for hundreds of feet in front of them. If you can’t see the pilot
house, the pilot or captain probably can’t see you.
 Large ships are difficult to maneuver and can’t turn at all when
stopped. Stay out of their path; avoid them — don’t make them avoid
you. Furthermore, the speed of large ships is very deceptive, and stop-
ping can take them more than a mile.
 Large ships can block your wind from a long way away. This interfer-
ence can slow you down and make avoiding them difficult.
 Large ships must stay in the channel to avoid running aground. In con-
fined waters, aids to navigation, usually buoys, mark the channel. You
may need to consult a chart to find the channel. (For more information
on reading a chart, see Chapter 9.)
 The turbulence in a large ship’s wake can throw your boat around. A
heavy ship’s wake can create big waves that swamp or flood your little
boat.
75
Chapter 4: Before You Leave the Dock

 Understand the whistle blasts. Five or more short blasts is the “danger”
signal. Get out of their way, now!
 Stay away from U.S. Navy ships. You must stay more than 100 yards 
(91 meters) from any U.S. Navy ship, and you must slow down to mini-
mum speed within 500 yards (457 meters) under Homeland Security 
regulations.
If two boats meet, follow these basic rules:
 Moving boats must avoid stopped boats.
 Sailboats have right-of-way over powerboats, except for fishing vessels
and large commercial vessels with restricted maneuverability (that
means all big ships, especially in channels).
If you find yourself on a collision course with another boat, even if you have
right-of-way, don’t be a sea lawyer. Make an early and aggressive course
change away from the boat. Don’t assume that the other boat sees you or
that it will change course. Don’t play a game of chicken. Alter your course
early to show the other boat clearly your intended new heading to stay out 
of its way. For tips on steering straight, see Chapter 11. For the basic rules
when any two sailboats meet, see Chapter 13.

nderstanding the important relationship between the wind and your
boat and getting yourself, your boat, and your crew ready all lead up 
to the best part — going sailing! If you have time to read only one chapter 
of this book before heading out on the water, this is the one.
This chapter covers the basics of sailing and seamanship. Webster’s Dictionary
defines seamanship as “the art or skill of handling, working, and navigating a
ship.” This definition is purposefully vague regarding the size of boat or the
wind and sea conditions. This chapter focuses on the skills you need to handle
your boat in moderate conditions — which hopefully describes the weather for
your beginning sailing trips.
The first part of this chapter shows you when to pull in the sails, and the last
part shows you how to pull in the sails safely. So hoist your sails (refer to
Chapter 4 for help) and get out on the water!

Finding the Wind’s Direction
The world of sailing revolves around the wind. Your boat can’t go anywhere
without wind (unless you fire up the engine, which, at this point, would be
cheating).
But before you head out to sea, you need to keep safety in mind. Whether
you’re an old salt or a beginning sailor, being safe on your boat is integral to
enjoying the sport. In Chapter 7, we review various safety issues in detail. But
remember that no sailor should go out in conditions that exceed his or her
ability. A beginner’s first sail should be in light to moderate wind conditions
in protected waters. Furthermore, as we explain in Chapter 2, the best and
safest way to start sailing is to take instruction from an experienced and qual-
ified individual. As you grow in experience, you can expand your limits.
Assessing the wind’s direction is of utmost importance to a sailor. The wind’s
direction is a sailor’s North Star, the center of his sailboat’s universe. Where
he goes, how he trims his sails, whether the ride is wet or dry, fast or slow —
all these depend on the wind and its direction.
The wind changes all the time, and your ability to accurately sense changes
in the wind speed and direction is the single most valuable skill you bring
aboard a sailboat. Increasing your sensitivity and awareness of the wind is
the first step in becoming a sailor.
Feeling the wind
The best way to track the wind is simply to feel it. Your body, especially your
face, can feel the exact direction of the wind if you just let it. Here’s how:
Close your eyes and turn your face until you think that the wind is blowing
straight at you. Rotate your head back and forth slightly until you sense that
the wind is blowing equally hard across each side of your face, and the
“sound” of the wind is the same in each ear.
Practice “feeling” the wind whenever you can. The wind can keep shifting direc-
tion and strength. A key to sailing is staying aware of the wind’s changes.
Using other clues to find the wind
Besides feeling the wind, you can look around and see clues to the wind’s
direction. A flag or wind vane on top of a mast can show the wind direction,
and so can a flapping sail, which waves in the wind like a flag. On your own
boat, short pieces of yarn or cassette tape tied to the shrouds, the wire 
80
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

rigging supporting the mast, can provide crucial information about the wind’s
direction. Also look for sailboats under way or anchored boats that point at
the wind (except in strong currents). Another way to see the wind direction
is to look at the ripples on the water. Watch the movement of a darker patch
of water caused by a puff of wind. Seagulls stand facing into the wind, and
cows point their behinds into the wind — but unless you’re sailing next to a
farm, this bit of trivia is probably useless.
After you gain more experience, you’re also able to assess the wind speed 
by looking at the water. For example, whitecaps generally begin to form on
waves at 12 knots of wind speed. (See Chapter 8 for more on wind speed.)
Being able to gauge the wind strength is important for safety, because begin-
ning sailors should head for shore if the wind is above 12 knots (unless you
have an instructor on board).
If you find yourself getting overwhelmed by which rope to pull and what to
call a piece of equipment, relax and just feel the wind on your face. A sailor’s
world revolves around the wind, and you’re becoming a sailor.
Identifying the Points of Sail
Figure 5-1 is the big kahuna of sailing, the points of sail diagram. As you
become a sailor, you can get away with forgetting which side is starboard or
which corner of the sail is the tack, but you can’t sail without understanding
the information in this diagram.
The points of sail diagram looks like the face of a clock, with the wind blowing
from 12:00. At the top of the clock face, from about 10:30 to 1:30, is the sector
called the no-sail zone. It gets its name from the fact that it’s physically impossi-
ble to sail a boat in this zone. You can call the no-sail zone whatever you like —
the can’t-sail zone or the anti-sail zone or, if the sun is setting and strange things
are happening, the Twilight Zone. Pointing your boat anywhere else around the
clock face is fair game — with the sails trimmed properly, you move forward.
This “sail zone” further divides into three basic points of sail:
 Close-hauled: Also called beating, sailing upwind, or sailing to windward,
it’s the closest course to the wind that you can effectively sail on the
very edge of the dreaded no-sail zone. So close-hauled is right at 10:30
and 1:30.
 Reaching: Anywhere between close-hauled and running.
 Running: The course you’re steering when the wind is dead behind.
Exactly 6:00 on the clock face if you’re a stickler — from 5:30 to 6:30 if
you’re like us.
81
Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please

More about that darn no-sail zone
The no-sail zone is about 90 degrees wide — about 45 degrees on either side
of the wind direction, or from 10:30 to 1:30, if you like the clock. In this zone,
a sailboat can’t generate power from its sails and will coast to a stop. The
problem is that your sails luff (flap) even when you pull them in all the way.
As you enter the no-sail zone from the sail zone, the front edge (luff) of your
sails start luffing a little bit (it looks like the front of the sail is bubbling), and
you start to slow down. If you turn to the very middle of the no-sail zone,
your sails flap like flags, and your boat quickly coasts to a stop. In fact, if you
stay in the no-sail zone too long, the wind blows your boat backward, which
is called being in irons. Getting in irons happens to every first-time sailor.
Find out all about getting out of irons in the “Ironing out those irons” section,
later in this chapter.
But the beauty of sailing is that you have a way around this apparently for-
bidden territory. To get to a destination directly upwind in the no-sail zone
(say 12:00), you can take a zigzag route (see Figure 5-2), sort of like hiking up
a very steep mountain. This technique involves sailing close-hauled and peri-
odically tacking (a maneuver where you turn the boat from 1:30 to 10:30 or
vice versa). With this knowledge, you can literally sail wherever you want!
(We explain the wonders of tacking in the “Tacking: Turning toward the wind”
section, later in this chapter.)

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

You must be very clear on one point: No boat can sail a course directly into
(toward) the wind. If you try to do so, the sails start luffing, no matter how
tight you try to trim them — like they do when the bow is pointed into the
wind at the dock. The boat glides to a stop and eventually blows backward,
like any object floating on the water.
Sailing in the zone
Sailing in any direction in the sail zone is as easy as trimming the sail (by
pulling in on the control rope — the sheet). We show you the safest way to
pull in ropes in the “Pulling In Lines” section, later in this chapter. Or you can
just cleat the sail (tie off the control rope so that the sail stays in one place)
and turn the boat away from the wind direction until the sail fills. The points
of sail diagram shows boats sailing at all different angles to the wind in the
sail zone.
To sail fast, trim the sails to the proper angle to the wind. As you can see in
Figure 5-1, you trim the sails differently for the various points of sail. You pull
the sails in tight when a boat is sailing close-hauled and let them out all the
way when on a run. When you’re reaching, the in-between point of sail, trim
the sails in between. Makes sense, huh?

Keeping your sails properly trimmed is important for maneuverability. Any
time your boat slows down, you must be extra vigilant because a very slow
boat can lose steerage on any point of sail. Don’t just stop in a waterway
unless you have plenty of room to regain your forward motion.
Sailing on the edge: Close-hauled
The key to sailing upwind is steering a course just on the edge of the no-sail
zone, as physically close to the wind as possible — at about 10:30 or 1:30 on
the clock face, depending on which side you’re sailing on. Because the wind
is never perfectly steady, continuous attention and subtle steering adjust-
ments are required to stay right on the edge. When sailing close-hauled, you
must trim your sails in very tight, as Figure 5-3 shows. When they begin to
luff, you can’t trim them in any more, so you must turn (with the rudder)
away from the wind just a tiny bit until the sails stop luffing.

Why is the no-sail zone 90 degrees?
The size of the no-sail zone is slightly different
for each boat. Some racing boats with very effi-
cient sails and keels can sail as close as 
30 degrees to the wind. For them, the no-sail
zone is around 60 degrees wide (the angle 
from close-hauled on one side of the zone to
close-hauled on the other). The wind strength
also affects the size of the no-sail zone. In very
light air, all boats go slower, and the foils (the
keel, rudder, and sails) are less efficient, so you
sail a wider angle to the wind than you do in
stronger winds.

When your sails are full, try to turn the boat a little bit toward the wind to see
whether you can sail closer to the wind without luffing the sails. See, it really
is like sailing on the edge!
Sailing upwind is a modern feat. Columbus sailed across the ocean blue by
letting the sails on his square rigger act like a parachute and push the boat
along on a reaching or running course. But your boat can sail upwind by effi-
ciently harnessing the lift generated by the sail and the keel or center-board
and rudder. Therefore, you can sail much closer to the wind than Columbus
ever could. For more on how this “lift” works (if you’re the inquiring type),
see Appendix C.
Reaching for the gusto
Reaching is a catchall phrase for all points of sail between close-hauled and
running. Because it spans such a large range of wind angles, reaching is the
easiest place to start sailing. Reaching is also the fastest point of sail.
For your first time on a reach, steer the boat so that the wind is coming from
a direction roughly 90 degrees off the bow (blowing across your boat) and
trim your sails in until they just stop flapping. Reaching is the easiest point of
sail for a new sailor, so try it first and steer the boat to the right and left a
little bit to get the feel of how it responds to the tiller or wheel.
If you’re reaching on a heading 90 degrees to the wind direction, you’re on a
beam reach, as Figure 5-4 shows. A reach at any heading between 90 degrees
and close-hauled is called a close reach. If you’re reaching at a wider angle to
the wind (an angle greater than 90 degrees), you’re on a broad reach. The
expression broad-reaching through life applies to happy-go-lucky people who
never have to worry about getting upwind.
On a reach, the sails are pulled in just to the point where they’re no longer
luffing. Although they still look full if you trim them farther in, you give up
valuable power when you overtrim the sails.

Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please
Sailing with a not-so-patient Joe
One of the great collegiate sailing coaches was
longtime Tufts University sailing coach Joe
Duplin. Joe was a world-renowned racer,
famous for his creativity on the race course and
his New England accent but not for his patience
with teaching beginning sailing to inexperi-
enced pupils. Joe would sum up all the infor-
mation in the previous two chapters in two
sentences. Pointing to the tiller, he’d say, “This
is the steering wheel; pull it this way to turn right
and this way to turn left.” Then, grabbing the
mainsheet rope, Joe would finish the lesson by
saying, “This is the accelerator. To speed up,
pull it in; to slow down, let it out!” Then he’d
push his student’s boat off the dock and hope for
the best.

An important rule for sail trim is when in doubt, ease it out! Check the trim of
your sails by easing (letting out) their respective sheets slightly. If they begin
to luff, you were set perfectly, so pull your sails back in to where they were. 
If they stay full, you were overtrimmed. Check the trim by easing and then
pulling back in periodically, as Figure 5-5 shows.
Running with the wind
Sailing with the wind behind you (going the same direction as the wind is
blowing) is called running (or sailing downwind). Sailing with the wind at your
back is great — the boat doesn’t heel, and because your forward motion
reduces the wind blowing across the deck and no spray comes on board,
you’re warmer. Naturally, you’d like to sail on a run all the time. But unless
you’re going on a one-way trip, you must, at some point, pay the price by 
sailing back upwind.
On a run, you need to let the sails all the way out — 90 degrees to the wind 
so the wind is blowing from directly behind the boat. The sails act like a big
barn door rather than an airfoil, so you can’t find the proper trim by over-
easing the sail until it luffs. The wind is simply pushing the boat along.
You’ve probably seen pictures of sailboats with big, colorful, balloonlike sails.
These specialty downwind sails are called spinnakers, and they help you go
even faster by catching more wind. You find out how to sail with a spinnaker
in Chapter 12.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

If your boat has a jib, you may find that it doesn’t want to fill when you’re on
a run because it’s in the wind shadow of the mainsail. You can, however, get
some extra horsepower by winging the jib. Simply pull the weather side jib
sheet around until the sail fills on the side opposite the mainsail. Then hold
or cleat the jib sheet so that the sail is set approximately 90 degrees to the
wind, as Figure 5-6 shows. Running is the only time when your mainsail and
jib can set on opposite sides.
Avoiding sailing by the lee
If you’re running close to dead downwind (or 6:00), you must be careful that
you don’t turn a little farther and end up sailing by the lee (with the wind
coming across the same side of the boat as the boom is on, as Figure 5-7
shows). Changes in wind direction can be tougher to feel when you’re sailing
on a run, and a wind shift can also force you suddenly by the lee.
You can usually sail 5 or 10 degrees by the lee (compared to dead downwind)
without having the boom fly across. But depending on the setting of your
mainsail, as you sail farther and farther away from dead downwind on the
wrong heading, at some point that wind is going to send your mainsail and
boom whizzing across via special delivery.
Sailing by the lee can be very dangerous, especially in stronger winds, because
as soon as the wind pushes on the “back” side of the mainsail, it can force the
boom across the deck very suddenly and make you jibe accidentally.

You can prevent sailing by the lee by watching your sails and the wind direc-
tion. Some boats have an arrowlike wind indicator at the top of the mast that
can help. Also watch the battens; if they’re trying to flip over, you’re in a trou-
ble zone. Another good indicator that you’re close to this trouble zone is
when your jib collapses because the main is totally blocking it. Keep asking
yourself, “Where is the wind coming from now?”
If the boom does start to come over unexpectedly, be sure to yell “Duck” as
loudly as you can to warn your crew to duck! Many sailors have suffered
bruises or worse from a whack in the head by the boom.

Pointing Out the Basic Sailing Terms
You need to be familiar with some basic sailing terminology before getting
into sailing maneuvers. The following section covers heading up and bearing
away, port and starboard, and windward and leeward.
Heading up and bearing away
The two phrases heading up and bearing away describe any turn on a sail-
boat. Like almost everything in this chapter, their definitions are also relative
to the all-important wind direction. When you make a turn toward the wind,
you’re heading up. When you’re steering with a tiller (and sitting in the
proper position — on the windward side, facing the sails, as we show in
Chapter 4), you push the tiller away from you to head up.
The term bearing away is more common than heading down or bearing off,
but they all mean a turn away from the wind direction. You pull the tiller
toward you to bear away — assuming that you’re sitting in the proper posi-
tion. If you were to sail in a complete circle, you would, by definition, be bear-
ing away half the time and heading up half the time. Figure 5-8 shows both
heading up and bearing away.
Port and starboard tack
Port is left and starboard is right (when you’re facing the bow, the front of the
boat). The easiest way to keep these new terms straight is to remember that
both left and port are shorter than right and starboard. These nautical words
for left and right are optional much of the time, because their land-based

89
Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please

cousins are equally clear, but using them is important when you’re describing
whether a boat is on port or starboard tack.
Like almost everything else pertaining to sailing, the determining factor is the
wind. When you’re sailing with the wind coming over the left side of your
boat, you’re on port tack. When the wind is coming over the boat’s right side,
you’re on starboard tack. Whether you’re close-hauled, reaching, or running
doesn’t matter; the determining factor is which side of the boat the wind is
hitting first (except if you’re sailing by the lee as described in the “Avoiding
sailing by the lee” section, earlier in this chapter).
Windward and leeward
The left side of your boat is always the port side, but which is the windward
and which is the leeward side changes depending on the angle of the wind to
your boat. The wind always hits the windward side of the boat first. The lee-
ward side, then, is the other side of the boat. You can remember leeward
because the word comes from in the lee, which means “out of the wind.” The
wind pushes your sails onto the leeward side. If your sails are in the center,
then they’re luffing and you’re in irons. (See “Ironing out those irons,” later in
this chapter.)
Except when you’re winging out the jib on a run, you always set your sails on
the leeward side. If you get confused about which side is windward and which
is leeward, simply let the jib or mainsail luff so that the sail flaps like a flag as
Figure 5-9 shows. Whichever side the sail is flapping toward is the leeward side.
When the wind’s blowing, docks, buoys, and land also have two sides relative
to the wind. The side closer to the wind is called windward, and the side far-
ther away from the wind is called leeward. The windward side of an island
can be much wetter as storms hit that side first, while the leeward side is
calm and protected.

Making the Basic Sailing Maneuvers
Imagine that you’re sailing along on a nice beam reach, but a long shoreline
looms in front of your bow. You can avoid this obstruction by choosing one of
the two basic sailing maneuvers:
 Tacking, or changing tacks by turning the boat from one side of the no-
sail zone to the other.
 Jibing, or changing tacks by turning the boat away from the wind until
the wind blows on the opposite side.
This section also delves into the most common mistake when tacking: getting
in irons (getting stuck pointing into the wind).
Tacking: Turning toward the wind
Earlier in the “More about that darn no-sail zone” section, we point out that
you must use a zigzag route to reach an upwind destination. First, you sail on a
close-hauled course on one tack, and then you tack (turn the boat through the
no-sail zone) and sail a close-hauled course on the other tack. This maneuver
of turning the boat through the dreaded no-sail zone, or “through the wind,” is
called tacking.
To get to a point upwind, you can either tack once (assuming that the harbor
is wide enough), or you can tack many times — you’re the skipper, so you
decide! Refer back to Figure 5-2 to see examples of several upwind tacks.
Here are the steps to tacking (see Figure 5-10).
1. Prepare your crew by calling out “Ready to tack!”
Make sure that your crew is ready and in their positions.
2. Call out “Tacking!” and begin turning the boat toward the wind (head-
ing up), as shown in the top photo in Figure 5-10.
Instead of “tacking,” some sailors use the term helm’s alee or hard alee,
meaning that their helm (the rudder) has been put hard over to the lee-
ward side to initiate the turn. As with most sailing terms, any hail will
do, as long as everyone on board understands it.
As you begin to turn, the sail begins to luff wildly. This step is when most
beginners have problems, because if you stop turning at this point, you
get stuck in the no-sail zone.
Don’t forget to duck your head as the boom swings across.
91
Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please

3. Release the old jib sheet and trim the new one as the boat rotates
through the no-sail zone.
Your crew can omit this step if you don’t have a jib.
4. Switch sides (see the middle photo in Figure 5-10).
You (and your crew, if necessary) switch sides in order to retain visibil-
ity and to get your weight to the new windward side. You may find
moving across easiest as the boat turns through the no-sail zone —
especially on a dinghy where your weight is needed as ballast when the
sails fill on the new close-hauled course.
5. Keep turning the boat until you exit the no-sail zone.
Slow down your turn as the sails begin to fill on the new side. When
you’re safely out of the no-sail zone, begin steering straight.
6. Check the trim of the sails on the new tack (see the bottom photo of
Figure 5-10).
The wind is now blowing across the other side of the boat.
Congratulations! You’ve successfully changed tacks. As you settle in on a
close-hauled course and confirm the proper trim of your sails, you may
want to cleat the sheets if they’re pulling so hard that holding them is
uncomfortable.
When tacking, turning all the way through the no-sail zone is important. As
the boat turns and the sails flap, your boat is losing momentum. Dally too
long in this zone, and you risk losing headway and getting stuck in irons, as
we discuss in the next section. So make sure that you keep turning until the
boat is turned far enough on the other tack that you can trim the sails in
without any luffing, and start accelerating. The entire maneuver should take
about five seconds on a small keelboat or dinghy.
Ironing out those irons
The most common mistake beginners make when trying to tack is to get the
boat stuck in the no-sail zone, dead in the water with no maneuverability. Just
like on a car, the steering wheel or tiller has no effect if your boat isn’t
moving. Being stuck head-to-wind in the no-sail zone is called being in irons.
(Some interesting reason going back to the days of the square riggers must
explain why this situation is called “in irons,” but that’s a story for another
day.) You get in irons when you don’t turn the boat all the way through the
no-sail zone during a tack, or if you turn too slowly during a tack, or when
you try to sail too close to the wind direction.

A tack, to tack, on a tack, tic-tack-toe
The word tack has many meanings in sailing.
The bottom front corner of a sail is the tack. The
noun tack also refers to the boat’s heading in
relation to the wind (that is, on starboard or port
tack). Tacking is the act of changing tacks by
turning through the wind, entering the no-sail
zone from one side and exiting the other.

To get out of irons and moving again on a boat without a jib, follow these steps:
1. Uncleat or release the mainsheet.
And keep it released until your boat has turned all the way to a close
reach. Your boat needs the mainsheet eased to be able to rotate out of
the no-sail zone.
2. Push the tiller (or turn the wheel) to one side.
Keep the helm hard over until the boat backs away to a close-reaching
position. Be patient; the boat turns as it starts to go backwards. Basically,
you’re doing the sailing equivalent of a three-point turn. To speed up the
process, you can push on the boom to back the mainsail (fill it backwards)
and help the boat go in reverse.
3. Trim the sails and steer straight (don’t pinch!).
You’re off!
Sounds easy, right? But beginning sailors are impatient and tend to steer back
and forth as they go backward, remaining stuck in irons. Just leave the helm
hard over to one side or the other until you’re on a reaching heading.
If your boat has a jib, you have an additional and powerful tool for escaping
from the clutches of the no-sail zone. To get out of irons on a boat with a jib,
follow these steps:
1. Pull the jib sheet taut on one side and put the tiller to the opposite
side.
If you’re pointed head to wind, either side works equally well. The jib
fills backwards and pushes the bow as Figure 5-11 shows.
2. Keep your mainsheet loose so that the main doesn’t fill until the boat
rotates around and is pointed on a reaching course.
Keep the tiller hard over on the side opposite the jib. With a wheel, you
turn toward the jib.
3. Release the jib sheet and trim both sails in on the “proper” side as the
boat accelerates.
4. Straighten out the tiller or wheel to avoid turning back up into the
wind when the boat begins to move forward again.
I can remember the first time I ever soloed a sailboat, when I was about 13
years old. I was halfway out into the harbor when it happened — I got caught
in irons. Back then, I had no idea what was going on, except for the obvious
fact that the boat wasn’t moving at all. My sailing instructor came up to me in
a motorboat and said, “Ya know you’re doing something wrong,” which was,
of course, patently obvious. Only later did I realize that I’d been caught in
irons. You can’t avoid getting caught in irons as a beginning sailor, so be pre-
pared for when it happens!
94
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Jibing: Turning away from the wind
The other method of changing tacks (changing your direction so that the
wind is blowing over the other side of the boat) is to turn away from the wind
and jibe. (Some books spell jibing as gybing, the British style. We stick with
jibing [ji pronounced as in giant].)
Because the downwind side of the points of sail diagram doesn’t have a no-
sail zone, jibing should be easier than tacking, and, in some ways, jibing is
easier, because you need to change course by only a few degrees instead of
the 90 degrees required when tacking. However, jibing is inherently more dan-
gerous than tacking, because of the force with which the boom swings across
the cockpit. Keep in mind that you’re on a broad reach or a run before you
jibe, so the sails are eased a long way out. Therefore, that boom has a long
way to travel across the boat. You can also start jibing from a reach, but
doing so requires a bigger turn.
The following steps and Figure 5-12 explain in detail how to jibe:
1. Prepare your crew for the jibe by calling out “Ready to jibe!”
Reminding them to duck never hurts. Given the force with which the
boom can swing across, you need to make sure that your crew is ready
and in position for this maneuver.

2. Call out “Jibing!” and start turning the boat away from the wind (bear-
ing away), and begin pulling (or have your crew pull) the main to the
other side.
The traditional term is “Jibe-ho.” Feel free to add “Boom coming across”
or “Duck” if you see that someone is in danger of getting hit by the boom.
You don’t need a big or a fast turn, because there’s no equivalent to
being stuck in irons on this side of the points of sail diagram. Unlike a
tack, where you have to keep turning the boat so that you don’t get
stuck head-to-wind, you may not need to turn the boat at all to jibe if
you’re already heading straight downwind.
On bigger boats with several crew members, having a person other than
the skipper pull in the mainsheet is safer because of the amount of line
to pull in and then release after the boom crosses the boat. (Make sure
that crew members keep their feet out of all that mainsheet line.)
3. As you turn past dead downwind, the mainsail will jibe.
As you turn and the wind shifts from one side of the boat to the other, the
wind wants to push the mainsail to the other side with tremendous force.
If you didn’t pull the boom across in a controlled manner (in Step 2), at
this point it will come flying across, taking with it everything in its path —
so use extreme care not to let this force pull the line through your hands.
And keep your head low.
4. Stop turning and steer straight as you trim the sails on the new jibe.
If you have a jib, you can pull it across to the opposite side now.
5. Switch sides of the boat.
On a keelboat you can perform this step whenever you’re most comfort-
able. On a dinghy, you need to switch sides as soon as the boom flies
overhead or immediately afterward so your weight keeps the boat from
tipping. The entire jibing maneuver takes about four seconds on a small
keelboat or dinghy.
In windy conditions, you may choose to change tacks without jibing. Instead,
just turn toward the wind, tack around, and then head down to your new
course. Equipment breaks easily when jibing in strong winds, because of the
sudden load on the mainsail after it swings across. On the big America’s
Cup–class boats, we always tacked instead of jibing before the race whenever
conditions were windy to minimize the risk of breaking our expensive carbon-
fiber battens.

Pulling In Lines
On a windy day, pulling in the boom on a jibe or trimming the sails when
close-hauled can be tough work. Some lines on sailboats are lightly loaded,
and adjusting them is easy. But others carry tremendous load, especially in
strong winds. Trying to pull these lines can result in strained muscles or
burned hands. Consider the forces on a line before uncleating it and trying to
hold it. “Plucking” the line like a guitar string gives you an indication of the
load on it. If the line feels like a steel rod and makes a note like a high G, then
don’t uncleat it or try to pull it without the help of a mechanical device like a
winch, which we cover in this section.
To help use all your strength, make sure that you’re in the correct position to
pull. You may need to sit down across from the line with your feet pushing
against some solid object. Fully extend your arms and grab the line with both
hands for maximum pulling power, as Figure 5-13 shows.
If you can’t pull the line even when you’re in the correct position, don’t give
up. Sailors of all ages and sizes can operate any boat, because various combi-
nations of pulleys and winches provide the mechanical advantage to enable a
wimp to do the work of a hulk.
This may be the most valuable sailing tip in this book: You can make pulling
in the lines easier through clever driving and by relying on teamwork. For
example, grinding in the jib sheet on a big cruising boat in strong winds can
be a real chore. But if the skipper simply heads up slightly toward the wind,
the sail begins to luff, and the load decreases. You may even be able to pull in
98
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 
What to say to your crew
As you can probably guess, sailors have many
terms for the person who steers the boat —
skipper, captain, and helmsman are three. The
one name you don’t want to be called is
“Captain Bligh” — the horrible captain from
Mutiny on the Bounty.
An interesting psychological phenomenon can
happen when a seemingly normal person gets
behind the wheel or tiller of a sailboat — he or
she can turn into a power-hungry maniac,
screaming orders and treating everyone on
board like scum. If you don’t want a mutiny on
board your boat, make sure that you treat your
crew the way you’d want to be treated.
“Tacking!” and “jibing!” are important com-
mands, but the “Ready to tack/jibe!” command
is equally important. Your crew needs some
time (30 seconds or so) to get in position before
you start the turn. If conditions are windy, you
may have to yell (nicely) to get them to hear you.
Planning your maneuvers in advance to give
your crew time to get ready is a skipper’s
responsibility. For safety’s sake, the skipper
should always look to make sure that everyone
is prepared and in a safe spot before turning the
boat. If someone gets hit by the boom, most
often the skipper is at fault.

the sheet by hand. Another way to substantially decrease the load on most of
the sail control ropes is to turn the boat downwind (bear away) onto a broad
reach or run. If your crew has a job to do on the bow, turn the boat down-
wind. Then the crew can safely go forward and have a flat and dry work
space. (Careful — no accidental jibes, please!)
Next time you face a really difficult physical task on a sailboat, ask yourself
whether you can do the job more easily by steering the boat at a certain
angle. Usually the answer is yes.
Using blocks
Mainsheets and most of the other lines on a sailboat run through blocks (pul-
leys). Some blocks just change the direction that the line travels, but when
you use several blocks in combination — block-and-tackle systems — they
make the line easier to hold and pull. The amount of extra lifting power,
called purchase, depends on the number of pulleys used and the arrange-
ment. Without delving into the mechanics involved, a four-part mainsheet
system (also referred to as a 4:1 system) requires only one-fourth the effort
to pull in the sail compared to a single rope hanging from the boom (a 1:1
system). The disadvantage of a four-part mainsheet system is that you have
to pull in four times as much line to bring in the sail.
A cascading arrangement multiplies the benefits, so a 2:1 system used with a
4:1 system provides an 8:1 mechanical advantage, as Figure 5-14 shows. (We
talk about the care and selection of blocks in Chapter 15.) No matter what
style, purchase systems all have the same purpose: to optimize the mechanical
advantage so that the average person can pull the line and sail the boat easily.

Regardless of the block-and-tackle system you use, you need to keep the line
from slipping when you have the rope trimmed where you want it. To prevent
slipping, you have two options: Hold onto the rope or cleat it.
Ratchet blocks
Some blocks ratchet, which means that they turn freely when you pull the line
but don’t turn at all in the other direction. This extra friction makes the line
easier to hold. Ratchet blocks are common on the mainsheets and jib sheets
of smaller keelboats and dinghies. They usually have a button or lever to turn
the ratchet action off and let the block turn freely in both directions, which is
useful in light wind. The extra holding power of a ratchet block makes hang-
ing onto the mainsheet on a windy day much easier.
Cleats
Most sailboats have more control lines than you have hands. Although cer-
tain creative sailors have been known to use their mouths to hold a rope or
two (which the American Dental Association doesn’t recommend), most con-
trol lines have some sort of cleat to hold them.
 Horn cleats and jammers: These very secure cleats are best for lines
such as halyards that you don’t adjust often. (See Chapter 4 for more on
hoisting sails.)
 Clamcleats and cam cleats: Easier to uncleat, these two cleats are well
suited for mainsheets, jib sheets, and other lines that you need to adjust
regularly. As you see in Figure 5-15, a Clamcleat has grooves that make it
look like the two sides of a clam shell. These grooves help hold a line
that’s under load. A cam cleat has two movable, notched jaws that use
spring action to open and to grasp the line. To uncleat the line, you pull
up and toward yourself (sometimes forcefully) to lift it out of the jaws.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

If your boat uses cam cleats or Clamcleats, make sure that the line is all
the way down in the jaws so that it stays securely cleated.
Using winches
Remember the old Charlton Heston movies in which sweaty, ragged sailors
pulled in ropes, grunting “Heave, ho,” like an ancient tug of war, while a bar-
baric foreman cracked a whip? Nowadays, you can use a winch to pull in that
line (and leave your whip at home). You use winches, another way to provide
mechanical advantage to adjust ropes under load, mainly on bigger boats,
where loads on lines can get really heavy.
Winches use a system of gears inside a round cylinder called a drum to give
you the necessary pulling power. Always wrap the line clockwise around the
drum, using more wraps as the load on the line increases. Put as many wraps
around the drum as you need — the wraps provide the friction so you can
hold a heavily loaded line in your hand.
The winch drum spins as you pull the rope wrapped around it if the rope isn’t
under load. But when the load builds (such as on a jib sheet when the sail
fills during a tack), you need to turn the drum with a removable handle called
a winch handle. This process is called grinding (and the folks who do it on big
racing boats are called grinders).
Grinding
While one person grinds, the other person pulls in (or tails) the line that
feeds off the drum. One person can do both jobs, but doing so is less effi-
cient. Some winches are self-tailing, meaning that they have a built-in mecha-
nism that grips the line and holds it in place so that one person can grind
without needing anyone to pull the rope. However, grinding is often a two-
person process, as Figure 5-16 shows.
Here are some tips for grinding and tailing properly:
 Choose the right speed. Many winches have two or more speeds or
gears. You change gears by changing the direction you turn the handle
so that you can shift speeds if the grinding gets harder.
Figure 5-15:
Clamcleat
(left) and
cam cleat
(right).
101
Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please

 Grind in a full circle, using two hands if necessary. If you can’t com-
plete a circle, turn as far as you can and then ratchet the winch handle
back to your starting point.
 If you feel the rope slipping, then either you aren’t pulling hard
enough or you need to add a wrap on the drum. When you’re pulling in
a slack or lightly loaded rope by hand, you usually need only one or two
wraps. But after the line becomes so loaded that you can no longer pull
it by hand and need to grind with the winch handle, you need about four
wraps. When you’re rapidly pulling in the slack out of a lightly loaded
rope, you should add enough wraps for grinding just before the line gets
loaded up. This is because when you’re rapidly pulling in a lightly
loaded line spinning around a winch, having too many wraps may cause
a tangle called an override. In the next section, we discuss adding a wrap
to a loaded winch and avoiding overrides.
 Stand in a comfortable position over the winch. You can grind a winch
sitting beside it (some winches are placed where standing over them is
impractical), but you won’t be able to grind as hard.
 When you’re not grinding the winch, remove the handle and place it
in its holder. These expensive items have never passed the float test,
and having the handle already removed is safer if you must quickly
release the rope on the winch. You never find winches on dinghies, so
you don’t have to worry about losing that handle in a capsize.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Adjusting lines safely on a loaded winch
A line under tremendous load can be dangerous to ease (let out) or trim.
Think first. The last thing you want is to burn your hands as a rope goes
whizzing through them. Don’t sail with any finger rings because they can get
caught on a line. Be especially careful with winches when you’re wearing
gloves. Make sure that your gloves fit snugly, because extra fabric can get
caught and pinched by the line spooling onto the winch drum.
When you need to add a wrap to a loaded winch, carefully hold the line with
both hands. Maintain tension on the line as you take both hands all the way
around the winch, turning your hands to keep your fingers from getting
caught, as Figure 5-17 shows.
To ease a line slowly and safely, hold onto the line with your right hand and
put your left hand on the wraps on the winch. Slowly let the line out counter-
clockwise, a couple of inches at a time, keeping some pressure on the line and
varying the pressure your left hand applies to the coil of line on the winch.
To take all the wraps off a winch quickly (common in a tacking maneuver on
bigger boats that use winches for their jib sheets), pull up on the line with a
slight counterclockwise rotating motion. Before you take off the wraps, make
sure that the long tail of the jib sheet is free to run, not tangled around your
foot (or a body part of your crew!).

103
Chapter 5: Going Sailing: Just the Basics, Please

When releasing a jib sheet on a winch during a tacking maneuver, wait until the
load has just eased on the sheet before removing all the wraps on the winch
drum. Watch for the jib to begin luffing as an indication that the helmsman has
begun turning the boat. If you cast all the wraps off the winch drum too early,
you risk burning your hands as the highly loaded rope runs out. Wait too late,
and the jib fills backward and your hands could suffer the same abuse.
At some point, probably when you’re already having a bad day, you’re going
to get an override — a misfed line that effectively creates a knot around the
winch, shown in Figure 5-18. Overrides can be caused by improper winch
placement so the rope feeds on it incorrectly or by having too many wraps
when you pull in a slack line.
In light air, you may be able to untangle the mess by pulling the rope’s end up
and around the winch the “wrong” way (counterclockwise). In stronger winds,
taking the load off the rope going to the winch and then untangling the mess is
usually best.
Before the sail is sheeted hard, you may be able to head up, take the load off
the sheet and manually untangle it. Otherwise, to take the load off the over-
ride, rig another line to do the same job. Or you can tie another line to the
tangled line (forward of the tangle) with a rolling hitch (see Chapter 19) and
then tighten the new line so that you have slack in the tangled part. The final
option, when danger is imminent or none of the other methods work, is to cut
the infringing rope with a knife. Be sure to cut the line near its end (near the
clew of the jib on a jib sheet, for example) so that it’s still usable (and only a
little bit shorter). Avoid cutting a halyard if at all possible, because it requires
a major rerigging exercise.

I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in

G
etting under way and getting back safely can be the trickiest part of
your day on the water. You’re often in a confined area with many other
boats (not to mention the shore) nearby, and the rudder doesn’t provide
much maneuverability while you’re at slow speeds and getting the boat
going. Plus, all the sailors on the other boats are watching and waiting for
you to mess up (not really, but it always feels like it).
We strongly encourage you to get some lessons before sailing (check out
Chapter 2). Try to have an instructor or, at least, a knowledgeable friend
along on your first few sails to help you get under way and back safely. Most
novice sailors practice on boats that already have the mast up and are tied to
a dock or a mooring (a permanently anchored buoy). But in case you need to
know, the end of this chapter covers the variety of ways to put up the mast
and get your boat from land to sea.

Leaving the Mooring or Dock
Casting off means untying and getting under way from a dock or mooring. If
your boat has an engine (an iron headsail in sailor slang), you can motor away
and put the sails up after you’re in open water. But knowing how to sail away
from a dock or mooring (and back again) under sail is a good idea in case your
engine decides not to cooperate some day.
Remember the classic movie, Caddyshack? Rodney Dangerfield left his fend-
ers (rubber cushions) dangling over the side while motoring around on his
big powerboat. So if you want respect, untie your fenders and dock lines and
store them below as soon as you have left the dock.
Using an engine
The biggest concern when using the engine (besides polluting the environ-
ment) is keeping lines from getting tangled in the propeller. We discuss that
problem and other mishaps in Chapter 14. Make sure that no loose lines are
dangling off the side of the boat. And always let go of the mooring line (the
line permanently attached to a mooring buoy) on the windward side so that
you don’t run over it as the boat sideslips while building speed.
Some moorings have stern anchors attached so all the boats face one uni-
form direction. If so, first let go of the stern anchor line (which usually has
weights attached), and make sure it sinks out of the way before proceeding.
Leaving the mooring under sail
Leaving a mooring is usually easier than leaving a dock, because the boat is
already in relatively open water, but getting the boat turned to an angle out of
the no-sail zone is trickier. We’re assuming that your boat is tied by the bow
with sails already hoisted, and is pointed into the wind. Use the following
steps to sail away from a mooring buoy, as Figure 6-1 shows.
1. Before casting off a dock or mooring, plan your best escape route.
Plan out a course so you can sail away on a reach (which gets you up to
speed quickly). Make sure the whole crew knows the plan.
2. The forward crew uncleats the mooring line but continues to hold it.
On bigger boats and in strong winds or current, one person won’t have
the strength to win the tug of war on the mooring line. So keep one full
wrap of the line around the base of the horn cleat on the bow (if avail-
able) so you can hold on yet be ready to cast off quickly.
106
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

3. With the mainsail luffing, back the jib.
Trim the jib on the side opposite the direction that you intend to sail so
that the jib backwinds (fills with wind backward) and pushes the bow
away from the no-sail zone. Make sure that the mainsheet has plenty of
slack so that the main can fully luff and won’t fill. See Chapter 5 on get-
ting your boat out of irons — it’s the same technique.
4. Walk the mooring line back along the windward side to shoot the boat
forward.
Have the crew holding the mooring line walk with it toward the stern —
on the windward side, so that the line doesn’t get caught under the boat.
As your crew moves back, your boat is pulled forward, especially on a
smaller boat, helping you gain speed and control. On bigger boats, if
holding the bow line is too difficult after it’s uncleated, just give it a good
heave away from the boat when the skipper gives the command.
5. The crew lets go of the mooring and trims in the sails.
Wait until the combination of your steering and the force of the backed
jib and fully luffing mainsail rotates your boat onto a reaching course.
Then release the backed jib and trim it on the correct side. As the boat
begins to gain speed, trim the luffing main and sail away on your desired
course.
Leaving the dock under sail
The key to easy arrival and departure from docks is to avoid tying up on the
windward (upwind) side of the dock. If you try to leave the windward side of
the dock under sail, the boat slips sideways as it gains speed and drags along
the dock — not good form! Plus, tying your boat to the leeward side of the

dock is better because the wind pushes the boat away from the dock, mini-
mizing the chance of scratching the hull against the dock. If you must tie up
on the windward side, ideally you can leave the dock using your engine. Have
extra crew on board to help fend off as you leave.
If you want to depart under sail and your boat isn’t tied up on the dock’s lee-
ward side (such as boats C, D, and E in Figure 6-2), move it. You can usually
move boats shorter than 25 feet (8 meters) to a better location by pulling
them with the dock lines or by holding onto a shroud (one of the wires sup-
porting the mast) and pulling. On a bigger boat, you can use the engine and
put the sails up in open water.
Just like when you leave a mooring, you don’t want to let go of the dock until
you have the boat turning so that you’ll be safely out of the no-sail zone. If you
have room at a dock, you can begin to turn the boat by pulling in on the bow
line and walking the boat along to generate forward motion so that the rudder
is effective. Usually you want to keep the mainsail fully luffing until you’re
safely into the sail zone, and if necessary, back your jib as described in
“Leaving the mooring under sail” to help turn the boat onto the desired course.
If you have plenty of space, you may be able to gain speed (and thus steerage-
way — the speed needed to steer) by having your crew members give a push
as they jump on board or by sailing close enough to a nearby boat or dock to
push off and get some extra speed.
After you’re safely away from the dock, remove any fenders (the rubber cush-
ions tied to the side of the boat to keep it from hitting the dock) and store
them down below out of the way. Also untie any dock lines, coil them up, and
store them out of the way, too.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Getting Back to the Dock or Mooring
Leaving the subject of launching your boat without discussing how to get
back to the dock or mooring would be like teaching you to ski and sending
you down the mountain without telling you how to stop. In skiing, you can
always stop by running into a tree or a big snowbank. The same technique
works in sailing, too — you can always run the boat aground or into the dock.
But considering how expensive insurance is, we want to give you cheaper
and less painful alternatives.
The key to docking or mooring is slowing down at a controlled rate before
you get there. You slow down by luffing the sails (see Chapter 5) and letting
the boat glide to a stop. The trick is knowing when to start luffing so that you
keep enough steerageway to reach the dock without having so much speed
that the phrase “ramming speed” becomes applicable.
When in doubt, err on the slow side. If you find that you aren’t going to 
reach your destination, you can always accelerate by retrimming your sails.
However, there is a catch: If you slow down so much that the boat is pointed
in the dreaded no-sail zone, you’re out of luck and in irons, as we describe in
Chapter 5. Getting in irons is a big problem when you’re in a confined area. So
please don’t go too slow or too fast!
What if you’re approaching too fast and can’t kill enough speed? The best
solution is to turn the boat around and try the approach again. (Nothing like
a practice run to help you judge when to begin luffing your sails on the
second try!) In fact, a wise sailor on a new boat always does some practice
runs out in the open, next to a buoy or some other floating object, to help
judge how the boat maneuvers as it decelerates.
Here are some other tricks that you can use to slow the boat:
 On smaller boats, you can kill speed by backing the main. Backing the
main is like having a huge air brake. To back the main, push the boom
toward the wind (the sail fills backward). Don’t try this technique unless
you’re strong enough to control the boom and smart enough to let it go
(and duck) if the boom begins winning the pushing contest.
 You can kill speed with the rudder. If you think you’re coming in too
fast, make some big turns instead of steering straight so that the boat
has more distance to slow down. Make sure that your crew is ready for
this maneuver and is holding on.
109
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

Coming back to the mooring
Always make a plan before you attempt to make a landing on any object. In
the case of a return to a mooring buoy, make sure that the whole crew knows
which mooring you plan to pick up. Designate one person to pick up the line
attached to the mooring buoy. Grabbing this mooring line may require a boat
hook, a pole with a hook on the end, to help extend a person’s reach. Some
mooring lines have a tall stick attached to a float so you can grab the stick to
pick up the mooring line. Other crew members should be ready to luff the
sails on your command.
Follow these steps when picking up a mooring:
1. Approach the buoy on a close reach and steer at an imaginary point
two to three boat lengths directly downwind from the buoy.
Adjust this offset distance based on the coasting or stopping character-
istics of your boat. Lighter dinghies slow down very quickly. On heavier
boats, the extra momentum makes slowing down take longer.
2. Depending on the wind strength and your boat speed (and other fac-
tors, such as current, which we discuss in Chapter 8), use your best
judgment to decide when to luff the sails to begin to kill speed.
You may want to luff the jib first and then the main to have more flexibil-
ity in adjusting your final speed.
3. When you’re almost directly downwind of the buoy, and if your rate
of deceleration appears to be correct, turn in a smooth arc toward the
wind and coast up to the mooring pointed directly toward the wind.
If you’re approaching too quickly, abort the landing and make another
try. If you’re approaching too slowly, retrim the sails and build more
speed. If you can’t see the buoy, have a crew member point at it for you.
As the bow reaches the buoy, the boat (ideally) comes to a dead stop.
On a bigger boat, a boat hook helps the foredeck crew grab the buoy.
4. Have the crew attach the boat to the mooring buoy.
Use a strong line and securely attach it to both the buoy and the boat (a
cleat or some other strong object on the bow). Make sure that you inform
the skipper when the boat is secure.
5. Now you can lower the sails to stop their incessant flapping!
On a boat with main and jib, dropping the jib (and maybe even clearing it
away from the foredeck) before making the approach may be best. Doing so
gives the crew more room to work up forward, reduces your sail power, and
gives you more visibility. The downside is that without a jib, you have less
control and ability to get out of irons, so be very careful to keep steerageway.
110
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Coming back to the dock
Docking under sail is often trickier than sailing up to a mooring, because the
dock is usually in a more confined space. However, the same basic rules apply:
 Plan your approach so that your crew knows what to expect.
 Have your fenders and dock lines tied and ready to go well before
you begin your final approach.
 Approach the leeward side of the dock or a side parallel to the wind
(any side except the dreaded windward side).
 Approaching slower is better, but don’t go too slow. If you stop, you
lose steerageway.
An ideal situation is a long, uncrowded dock with the wind blowing almost
parallel along it. Like with the mooring buoy, plan your approach so that the
boat has room to coast into position as it decelerates (see Figure 6-3). When
the boat is close enough (and going slow enough), have a crew member step
from the middle of the boat onto the dock so that she can begin securing the
dock line(s). Never yell for someone to jump; let the person who’s going to
get off judge when the boat is close enough to make her move. With this type
of approach (in which the sails are still up), the first line to be secured is the
bow line; then you can begin lowering sails and further securing the boat as
necessary.
So what do you do if you don’t have the ideal long runway? If you’re bringing
the boat alongside a dock, but you don’t have as much space, tie a spring line
(a line secured at the widest point in the middle of the boat; see “Spring
lines,” later in this chapter). You still need a bowline, stern line, and fenders
all in place and ready to go, but the most important line to secure first is the
spring line, because it helps stop the boat, followed quickly by the bow and
Wind
Approach the dock at an angle where you
can luff sails and with enough room to 
coast to a stop.
Figure 6-3:

111
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

stern line. When approaching side on (as in Figure 6-3), if your crew pulls in
on the bow line while you are coasting forward, this action pulls your bow in
and swings your stern out. A spring line just stops the boat without turning it,
because it’s pulling from the middle, widest point.
As soon as your crew is safely on the dock with the bow line secured (see
Chapter 19 for the proper knots), you can begin lowering the sails. Depending
on the angle of the wind to the dock, you may want to use more lines to tie
the boat alongside the dock (see “Tying Up a Boat: Leaving It Secure,” later in
this chapter). If there is enough space on the dock, you may want to concen-
trate on dropping the sails and cleaning up the boat before putting the boat
in its final resting place.
When helping to stop an incoming boat, the crew member with the dockline
should loop her line around the horn cleat on the dock (or around a piling or
other secure object) so she has some friction to give her more stopping
power than just her body weight. After the line is around the cleat, she can
ease it out slightly as the boat’s weight tugs on it rather than securing it and
causing the boat to stop short.
When a boat is approaching a dock, never put any part of your body between
the boat and the dock. Repairing a little fiberglass is easier than repairing
your body.
If you must tie up to the windward side of a dock, sail into a position directly
upwind of the dock, lower your sails, and let the wind gently push you down
to the dock.
Docking under power
Slower is better when docking — including when docking under power.
Having an engine doesn’t make the boat as maneuverable as your car. In fact,
at low speeds, the rotation of the propeller makes the boat pull, or turn
easier, to one side. In open water, practice slowing the boat to see how much
the propeller torque turns the boat and in what direction, especially in
reverse gear. As with docking under sail, the boat’s momentum, the wind
pushing the hull, and other factors, such as current, also affect your maneu-
verability. When you discover the maneuvering characteristics of your boat
under power, the principles of docking remain the same as those we outline
in the preceding section.
Make sure all lines are out of the water before starting your engine. If
approaching from upwind (or from an angle where you can’t fully luff the
sails), you should drop the sails before docking a sailboat under power.
Always approach slowly; never rely solely on reverse to slow the boat down.
Instead, use a spring line, which we describe later in this chapter in the
“Spring lines” section.
112
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Docking between pilings
In many parts of the world, you won’t have a nice, protected dock to tie
alongside. Often, the sailor’s best friends are pilings (large wooden poles
driven solidly into the bottom. Your array of dock lines depends on the posi-
tion and orientation of the pilings, and you have to be creative as you plan
your strategy to keep the boat from getting banged up no matter which direc-
tion the wind or current flows.
One of the most common dock arrangements is a short dock on one side and
pilings on the other side. Tie the dock lines from each corner (as well as spring
lines) so the boat hangs in the slot without banging into the dock or pilings, as
Figure 6-4 shows.
To keep your boat from getting scratched on pilings or on a rough dock, the
marina may use fender boards (long planks of wood with lines at regular
intervals). By attaching the fender board to your boat outside your fenders,
your boat stays off the pilings as the tide rises and falls.
If you fear that the wind is going to blow really hard, pushing the side of your
boat directly into the dock, consider alternative locations to park. If no other
locations are available, and no objects such as pilings are on hand to tie off
to, you can ease the force of the boat against the dock (and ease your mind)
by sending your dinghy out with an anchor directly abeam (perpendicular to
the centerline of the boat). If this anchor extends into a waterway, do your
best to mark it with a fender or other float to tell other boats to keep clear.
Chapter 10 shows you how to safely anchor for all situations.

Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

Throwing a Line
Sailing etiquette says that if sailors see a boat approach a dock, they should
walk over and offer to help catch a line. So you need to know how to throw a
line accurately and far. If you miss your target, you have to pull the soggy line
back on board and coil it, and then quickly try again.
The key to proper throwing is to start with a well-coiled line. Put a few coils
(up to about 15 feet or 41⁄2 meters) in your throwing hand and hold your other
hand (with the rest of the coils) open and pointed at the target so any extra
coils can feed out as needed. Then throw (underhand) the coils, aiming
slightly above the target. You can see Peter throwing a line in Figure 6-5.
Tying Up a Boat: Leaving It Secure
When your sailing day is done and the time has come to return to the rigors
of your shoreside life, you want to make sure that your boat is happy until
you next get an opportunity to visit it. Temporarily, your boat may be happy
to hang from a single bow line (while you’re nearby). For more permanent
storage, you need several lines. This section discusses how to tie up your
boat securely and safely to a dock. The following principles apply to all
boats, but they’re most useful when you’re securing a larger keelboat along-
side a dock:

 Always check for chafed (damaged) parts of the line.
 Always use fenders between the boat and the dock or pilings.
 Always use spring lines (see the “Spring lines” section for more info) —
Peter’s favorite dock lines.
 Make sure your docking line is amply strong and thick — at least 3⁄8 of
an inch (1 centimeter) for a 20-foot (6-meter) boat. Nylon line works
well because it’s designed to stretch.
 Don’t pull the stern and bow lines too tight. Ideally, the boat lies just
off the dock so that it doesn’t rub.
 Tie bow and stern lines at about a 45-degree angle away from the boat
to hold it secure.
Spring lines
Spring lines are incredibly effective. Tied from the middle of the boat, they
prevent the boat from surging forward or backward and keep it securely posi-
tioned so that the few fenders in the middle of the boat are always in the
right place. Figure 6-6 shows a boat tied up by a bow line, a forward spring
line, an aft spring line, and the stern line. In very rough conditions, you can
add additional spring lines and double up all the lines.
Make sure that you secure dock lines at both ends. For tying off a line on a
cleat or tying off to a piling (using either a bowline knot or a clove hitch), see
the nautical knots in Chapter 19.

Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

Watch out for that tide!
As you discover in Chapter 8, most large bodies of water have tidal flow,
thanks to the moon. When tying up your boat, use some common sense. If
your boat is going to float up and down on the tide, avoid tying it to some-
thing that doesn’t float, such as a piling. If you tie your boat incorrectly to a
piling or fixed dock at high tide, you may come back to find your boat sus-
pended out of the water at low tide.
If you must leave your boat tied up to a fixed piling or dock in tidal waters,
add more angle (and therefore more length) to all your dock lines by tying
them to points farther away than the closest part of the dock.
Getting Your Boat into the Water
As we mention at the beginning of this chapter, when you first begin to sail,
you probably don’t have to worry about launching the boat — the school or
the boat’s owner more than likely takes care of that. At some point, however,
you may find yourself ready to sail, but with a boat that’s high and dry. This
section goes over how to launch both keelboats and dinghies in the most
common situations.
Whether you’re launching from a trailer or a dolly or carrying a smaller boat
by hand, make sure you’re aware of any power lines between the point where
the mast is raised and the point where the boat is launched. Fortunately,
most yacht clubs, launching areas, and marinas remove overhead power
lines, but we want you to be vigilant.
Most boats stored on land have drain plugs. Leaving the drain plug out keeps
rainwater from collecting in it. More than a few sailing trips have been ruined
by neglecting to put the plug back in before launching, so be sure to check
the plug — and note that some boats have several plugs!
Launching a trailerable sailboat
Getting your boat into the water can be an involved process — one that
sometimes even includes putting up the mast. Many small keelboats (shorter
than 25 feet, or 8 meters) and dinghies are dry-sailed — that is, you store
them on dry land on a trailer or dolly. Storing a boat on dry land means less
maintenance (no barnacles or weeds to scrape off the bottom) and no dock-
ing fees. Storing your boat on a trailer makes sailing in many different places
quite easy. Keep in mind that objects wider than 81⁄2 feet (21⁄2 meters) may
require extra permits to trailer on highways.
116
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Two common methods of launching a keelboat or larger dinghy are by using a
hoist (crane) or a trailer off a ramp.
Using a hoist or crane
Launching a boat by using a hoist or crane is easy — as long as you have
someone to help, the proper lifting bridle, and a boat that weighs less than
the maximum allowable weight for the crane. Follow these steps when using
a hoist to launch your boat:
1. Move the boat so that it’s underneath the crane.
Many cranes have an arc painted on the ground to help guide you in plac-
ing your boat. Place the boat so the crane pulls the boat straight up and
off the trailer. On boats with a backstay (a wire extending from the top of
the mast to the back of the boat), you may have to swing the crane’s arm
over the boat as it’s wheeled into place (as Figure 6-7 shows).
2. Attach the lifting bridle — the wire or rope sling arrangement that
balances and lifts the boat.
Check the lifting bridle (or other lifting device) and attachment points for
wear. And never let anyone stand or walk underneath a boat on a hoist.
3. Attach the bow and stern lines so that the boat can be rotated into
position as you lower it into the water.
4. Have one person operate the hoist and one hold the lines.
Don’t try to put your boat in alone; make sure that you have a buddy.

117
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

5. Begin lifting, making sure that the mast and shrouds are clear of the
crane’s arm.
Try to keep the boat perpendicular to the arm as you swing the boat out
over the water and begin lowering.
6. When the boat is in the water, one person can unhook the lifting
bridle while the other secures the bow line.
7. Before rigging, move the boat and trailer away so that others can use
the crane.
8. Swing the arm back over shoreside.
Because the greasy chain or cable from the hoist can mess up your sails (and
your hands and anything else), always rig the sails after the boat is in the
water and away from the crane.
Launching from a trailer off a ramp
Our two main rules for successfully launching off a ramp are
 Accept that you’re going to get your feet wet.
 Plan ahead. Stop, get out of your car, and check out the ramp before
you back the trailer down. Look at its angle, check for a big drop-off at
the end, and plan where you want to position your trailer. Then look at
the dock space. When the boat is launched, where are you going to tie
up so that you can hoist the sails? How are you going to get to the dock?
When you have a good plan in mind, get in your car and go for it. Backing up
a car and trailer is sort of like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at
the same time — it can be difficult. Trailers are well-behaved beasts when
going forward, but going backward is another story. Oversteering causes the
most common malady, jackknifing the trailer. If your boat and trailer are light
enough for one person to handle, carefully walk the trailer into the water. But
be careful — ramps can be steep and slippery.
Follow these steps to launch your boat from a trailer on a ramp by using a car:
1. Put the mast up.
See the section “Putting up a mast,” later in this chapter.
2. Position your car and trailer parallel to the ramp.
Going backward is much easier when you don’t have to turn.
3. Remove all the various lines and straps used to secure the boat,
except for a line or cable that attaches the boat to the trailer and a
bow line you’ll need later to guide the boat to the dock.
118
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

4. Go slowly down the ramp and correct any tendency to jackknife by
turning the back of your car in the same direction the back of the
trailer is turning.
Make sure you can see or have a person outside your car help direct you.
5. Back up until the boat is just floating off the trailer, before the wheels
(or at least the brakes and wheel bearings) of your car touch the water.
6. Make sure that your parking brake is set before getting out of your car
to disconnect the boat from the trailer.
Saltwater is highly corrosive (as you know from the salt put on the roads
after a snowstorm), and even in freshwater, cars can’t swim, so don’t put
your car in the water.
If the bottom of the ramp has slimy algae, be careful! This stuff is as slip-
pery as ice.
7. When the boat is afloat, unhook or untie the bow from the trailer.
This part is where you get your feet (and maybe your legs) wet. If a dock
is nearby, you may be able to take the bow line, walk around to the dock,
and pull the boat to you while staying dry, but don’t count on it.
If no dock is available, you may want to consider rigging the sails (but
not hoisting them) before you launch, because you probably have to
climb in the boat from the water — similar to launching and sailing away
from a beach, which we describe in the “Starting from the beach” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
8. After you launch your boat and tie it to the dock, go back and move
your car and trailer.
Launching without a trailer
Dinghies are commonly dry-sailed. Because most are lighter than keelboats,
you can often launch smaller dinghies off a dock or ramp or even off a beach
without the need of a hoist or a trailer.
You can transport small dinghies on roof racks on top of your car. To get the
boat down without damaging it, find several friends and follow these steps:
1. Find a dolly (lightweight trailer for movement by hand) or padding to
put the boat on.
2. Find enough people so that lifting the boat is easy.
3. Slide or lift the boat off the roof and lower it down, carefully setting the
edge of the boat (at its widest point) on the padding or on the dolly, as
Figure 6-8 shows.
119
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

Never set your dinghy on the ground; you can scratch the hull.
4. With most of the weight supported on its edge, flip the boat over in
the air so that it’s right-side up.
5. Lift and set the boat on the dolly or padded area for rigging.
Now, depending on how you’re going to launch, you can prepare the
boat to go sailing. (See Chapter 4 for more about rigging.)
Sliding a dinghy off a dock
Even without a dolly, you can launch lightweight dinghies off the dock — you
just need the lifting skills of some friends to get the boat into position at the
edge of the dock.
When you have the boat set at the side of the dock, get all the gear ready to
sail (see Chapter 4) if you haven’t already. Lift the boat on each side and slide
it into the water (see Figure 6-9). If the dock doesn’t have padding at the edge,
place some padding to cushion the hull as you slide it in, or keep lifting so the
boat doesn’t touch the dock. Then grab the bow line and tie the boat to the
dock to further rig it and hoist sails.
Any time you must lift a boat, always ask for plenty of help. Bend your legs
and keep your back vertical to avoid injury.
Figure 6-8:

your boat,

to set it

the hull.
120
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

If the wind is very light or is blowing from the dock toward the water, you
may consider hoisting the sails before you launch, but you usually hoist the
sails afterward. Just remember to put the centerboard down when you first
get in the boat, or else the boat will be very tippy.
Starting from the beach
Launching off a beach is tricky unless the wind and wave conditions are
really mild. Ideally, there are no waves and only a soft offshore breeze (wind
blowing from shore to water) or sideshore breeze (wind blowing parallel to
the shore), so sailing straight off the beach is easy.
You can rig boats in any number of ways, so don’t be afraid to ask your
instructor or the owner for assistance (and see Chapter 4 for how to rig a typ-
ical boat). Most beach-launched boats require one or more of these tasks to
be done before putting the boat in the water:
 Consider hoisting one or both sails while the boat is still on the beach,
because hoisting them may be difficult after you launch the boat.
However, doing this makes carrying the boat into the water harder.
 If your boat has a kick-up rudder (one that rotates up and out of the
water), then rig it in the kicked-up position before launching.
 Rig the boat and store all your gear on board.
Now you’re ready to launch the boat off the beach:
1. Grab as many people as you can and carry the boat into the water.
You can’t avoid getting your legs wet here! Keep the bow pointed toward
the wind if the sails are hoisted. If you have a dolly, you won’t need a big
gang to get the boat floating in shallow water.
Figure 6-9:
Lift on either
side of the
boat and
slide it in.
121
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

2. When the boat is floating in knee- to waist-deep water, have someone
hold the bow while at least one crew member climbs into the boat to
prepare it for sailing.
The boat is incredibly tippy at this point, because you can’t put your
centerboard down very far until you’re in deeper water — but do put it
down partway.
3. Hoist the sails and lower the rudder (if it’s the kick-up variety) at least
partway (if the water is very shallow) while someone holds on to the
bow (front) of the boat.
4. Have the last person push the boat off on a reaching course and climb
into the boat.
You’re sailing!
When you’re the someone in Step 2 who is holding onto the boat in the water,
keep these safety tips in mind:
 Consider wearing shoes — there may be sharp objects underwater.
 If the waves are big, try to keep the boat pointed perpendicular to the
waves, just like a surfboard going out through the surf. This way, the
waves have less chance of grabbing your boat and throwing it — and
you — back on the beach. This task may be difficult if the sails are up.
 In waves, never stand between the boat and shore. Or else a wave
could squish you between the boat and the beach. Always stand on the
seaward side of the boat (although doing so may be difficult if the sails
are hoisted).
Never leave a boat halfway in the water with the bow pulled up on the beach.
Even small waves (or wakes from powerboats) can hurt the boat, or it may
float away.
Returning to the beach
Coming back to the beach can be even more difficult than launching. Again,
you can’t avoid getting wet. Here are the basic steps to bringing a sailboat
onto the beach:
1. Luff your sails and kill your speed a long way out and approach the
beach slowly, with the sails fully eased.
You have to adjust the angle of approach to accommodate the wind direc-
tion. If the beach is dead downwind, you may have to briefly turn head-to-
wind (away from the shore) when you get close and drop your mainsail.
2. If the water is shallow, pull up your rudder and centerboard partway
before the approach.
122
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

3. When you’re close to shore, turn the boat head-to-wind and stop.
4. Have your crew jump overboard (you should be close enough to shore
that they can stand on the bottom) and hold the boat’s bow while you
drop sails, fully pull up the centerboard, and remove or kick up the
rudder.
5. Jump in the water and get the dolly or additional people to help carry
the boat onto the beach.
Dragging the boat on the sand scratches the bottom, so always carry
your boat.
When sailing in saltwater, whether you return from sailing to the beach or to
a dock, remember to hose that salt off. For more tips on caring for your boat,
see Chapter 15.
Putting up a mast
Some boats are stored with the mast up. Other boats (usually dinghies) require
the crew to step, or put up, the mast before every sail. You can use a number of
different techniques to step a mast, depending on the boat’s equipment. Some
masts on bigger dinghies and keelboats are so heavy that they require a crane
(or some other special lifting device) to help. If this is your first time stepping
the mast, make sure that you have experienced help. On smaller boats (up to
about 14 feet, or 4 meters, in length), one person can usually lift the mast up
and into position in the boat, but having help never hurts.
We need to say it again: If you’re putting a mast up on land, first take a good
look around (and up) for overhead power lines.
To get the mast from horizontal to vertical, follow these steps:
1. Have someone push the tip of the mast upward while the base is
secure against your foot or other object.
2. When the mast is vertical, lift it into position in the boat.
You may find that handing the vertical mast to someone sitting in the
boat is easier.
If you get uncomfortable, be sure to ask for help; few sounds are louder
than a mast falling over into the parking lot (especially on somebody
else’s car)!
3. When the mast is set into its mast step, you can begin to attach all the
standing rigging (shrouds, forestay, and backstay).
Often, attaching the standing rigging is a two-person job to make sure
that the mast remains vertical during the process (see Figure 6-10).
123
Chapter 6: Leaving the Dock (And Coming Back)

4. As you attach the standing rigging, carefully inspect all the fittings
that support the mast.
Tighten any shackles with pliers, and make sure that the fittings are
secure. (Check out Chapter 15 on shackles and other rigging gear.)
Some small dinghies have free-standing masts without any standing rigging.
On these boats, you may slide the sleeve on the mainsail luff (the front edge
of the sail) over the mast before putting it up, as Figure 6-11 shows.

 Staying on board
 Handling a man-overboard emergency

There isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky

—J.R.R. Tolkien
N
ever underestimate the power of Mother Nature! When you sail on the
water, you’re her guest, and even on the most relaxing of sailing days,
you need to respect her capacity for pure brute strength. Safety on the water
comes in many forms and at many levels. On a hot summer day, reapplying
sunscreen and remembering to drink enough water may be your primary con-
cerns. If you’re out in the open ocean in strong winds, being tossed about by
waves that make your boat seem like a toy, the concept of safety takes on a
very real meaning of survival.
Although we stress that you should never go sailing on a boat or in condi-
tions that exceed your experience and comfort level, expect the unexpected
any time you head out on the water. Making sure that you have the requisite
skills and equipment to handle whatever happens on your sailboat is the only
safe way to approach a day on the water. So in this chapter, we show you how
to safely catch a tow and use your marine radio.
Having fun when you sail is easy. In this chapter, we also help you prepare for
the not-so-fun situations that can arise, such as handling bad weather, recov-
ering from a capsize, and rescuing a “man overboard” (of course, women,
children, and pets can fall in and need retrieving too).

Preparing for Heavy Weather
When the “sheep are in the pasture” (whitecaps all over the water), sailing
can be fun or terrifying, depending on your boat, you and your crew’s level 
of competence, where you are, and how windy the weather really is.
Heavy weather and heavy air are sailors’ terms for a strong breeze. As you
find out in Chapter 8, sailors measure wind velocity in units called knots and
can estimate the speed of the wind by looking at the water’s surface. We rec-
ommend that a beginning sailor head for home when whitecaps (foamy wave
crests) become commonplace, or at about 15 knots. But for an experienced
sailor (especially on a high-performance dinghy or catamaran), 15 knots of
wind is when sailing gets fun.
Sailing in strong winds can be addicting. You get to blast around at high
speeds. Pushing your limits and conquering your fears can boost your self-
confidence (and you’ll sleep well that night). And when you make it back to
shore, you have a new appreciation for the simple things in life — like being
on dry land.
This section enables you to raise your wind threshold so that you can enjoy
and stay safe on those blustery days. We concentrate on windy but sailable
conditions, because they’re by far the most common. Look at Chapter 14 for
tips on surviving a storm, when every sailor should be on shore.
Getting ready in advance
The following list includes some important safety rules you need to remem-
ber before you head out on a windy day:
 Don’t jump too far too fast. If your limit has been 10 knots, try 12 or 15
knots before going out when the forecast calls for gusts up to 25 knots.
 Go out in familiar waters. If you’re in a “new” area, make sure that the
wave conditions aren’t excessive and that plenty of deep, open water is
around. The last thing you want to worry about is going aground.
 Go on a familiar boat. You feel more comfortable in a boat you’ve sailed
before.
 Have someone with more experience than you on board. If you’re sail-
ing a one-person dinghy, make sure that a potential rescue boat is
nearby with experienced boaters watching you.
 Put on a life jacket. And check the safety list in Chapter 3.
126
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

We don’t want to scare you from sailing in heavy weather; we just want to tell
you a few reasons why you shouldn’t exceed your limits. The following are a
few of the potential hazards you may face:
 The boat may become much harder to handle. In really heavy condi-
tions, the force of the wind and waves can throw the boat around. Being
out of control isn’t fun or safe.
 You may capsize. Practice righting your dinghy (check out “Recovering
from a Capsize,” later in this chapter) until it’s routine. However, things
can go wrong in rough and windy weather, and you may not be able to
right the boat against the force of the wind.
 You may lose someone overboard. The bigger the waves and the more
the boat is heeling in the wind, the harder it is to stay on deck. Practice
the man-overboard rescue we describe in the “Rescuing a Man Overboard”
section, later in this chapter. But remember that in big waves and strong
winds, returning and picking up a swimmer can be very difficult.
 Strong winds may cause gear to break. If your boat isn’t fully prepared
(and sometimes even when it is), things can and do begin to blow apart
as Mother Nature’s forces increase. We discuss how to deal with poten-
tial accidents in Chapter 14 and boat maintenance in Chapter 15.
Preparing when you’re already at sea
The wind strength and direction can change quickly, even on cloudless days.
So even if you have the best intentions to follow the advice we mention ear-
lier in this chapter to not “jump too far, too fast,” chances are that someday
you’ll find yourself out on the water with the breeze building quickly.
When the sky starts looking ominous, your first plan should be to hurry back
to the harbor. This may mean catching a tow (see the “Catching a Tow” sec-
tion, later in this chapter) or firing up that engine and dropping all your sails
(see “Using an engine,” later). But if sailing is your only option, adjust your
sail trim to reduce power (see Chapter 12) and run through the following list
while making haste for home.
Getting your crew and boat ready for strong winds
When strong winds are imminent, do the following tasks right away to get
your boat and crew ready:
 Point your boat toward the closest harbor. Ideally this harbor is your
home; otherwise, remember the old saying “any port in a storm.”
 Put on life jackets and warmer clothes. In Chapter 3, we cover your
options of clothing for various conditions. The bottom line: Conditions
are going to get wetter and colder, so put the warm and water-resistant
127
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

clothes on now; otherwise you risk soaking your all-important interior
layers of clothing.
 Make sure everything is shipshape. When the wind comes up, the boat
heels (tips) more; if you’re on a dinghy, you may even capsize. Tie down
or securely stow all loose gear. On a dinghy, make sure your key equip-
ment (such as your rudder and centerboard) is always tied into the
boat. Now is the time to double-check.
 Make the boat as watertight as possible. Now is the time to “batten
down the hatches.” Close any windows or hatches, especially the ones
up forward, where the first spray comes on board. Bail out the boat — if
it’s bound to get wet outside, it’s nice to start out dry inside.
 Review safety procedures. It’s time for a quick review of the info in this
chapter. Also review the location of safety equipment (see Chapter 3 for
a checklist).
 Reduce your sail power. Reducing your sail power is important because
your boat will be easier and safer to handle. Check out “Reducing your
sail power,” later in this chapter, for more information.
Picking the right course
As the weather gets nasty, you can try to make that trip home easier by pick-
ing the safest course: a course that avoids the worst waves, the lee shore,
and accidental jibes.
Getting out of the waves
Often the big problem with heavy weather isn’t so much the wind but the
waves. We’ve sailed in the Gulf Stream in waves that are so big and steep that
the crew calls sailing upwind “condo-jumping,” because the boat feels like it’s
jumping off a condominium with the passing of every wave. Because wave size
(and shape) is a function of wind velocity, fetch (the distance of open water
the wave travels during which it gains height), current, and water depth, you
can sometimes plot a course that minimizes condo-jumping. Here’s how:
 Plot a course that makes use of the natural breakwater created by
land. For example, if you have a choice of sailing along the windward 
or leeward side of the island, go to leeward.
 Avoid shallow water. If you encounter big waves, you could run aground,
even where the chart indicates the water is deep enough. Plus, sailing in
big waves in shallow water makes for a very bumpy ride, because the
waves tend to grow (and even break) as the depth decreases.
 Avoid an upwind destination. Hey, that sounds pretty simple, but it’s
easier said than done. If you must sail upwind in big waves, try various
angles to the waves to find one that minimizes the bumps in the road.
128
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Sailing in big waves can be fun — like off-roading, except that the road is
moving. If the waves are so big that you feel them pushing your boat back-
ward, turn a little bit toward the wave — more perpendicular to the crest just
as it reaches your bow. This action minimizes the surface area that the waves
can push upon, similar to a surfer paddling out through the breakers. The key
when using this technique is keeping your speed — hence, steerageway —
up. Bear off and regain speed as soon as your boat is on top of the wave.
Avoiding a lee shore
A lee shore is a shoreline to leeward of a boat toward which the wind is blow-
ing. If the shoreline is an island, the lee shore is the island’s windward shore.
A very important rule of heavy-weather sailing is to avoid getting close to a
lee shore. As the wind builds, you always want an escape route of open water
to leeward. Then, in a worst-case scenario, you can simply drop your sails
and drift until the storm abates. A lee shore forces you to sail close-hauled,
the most demanding point of sail, to get away from its dangerous shallow
waters and boat busting solid objects.
Watching out for accidental jibes
Accidental jibes are bad, and any jibe in strong winds can be dangerous. When
the boom comes crashing to the other side, woe to the person whose head is
in the way. Not only does an unintended jibe risk the safety of any crew in the
path of the boom or the mainsheet, but it also can put tremendous (maybe
even excessive) forces on the mast and boom. You can avoid accidental jibes
with vigilant steering and by never letting the boat get near a dead run (with
the wind straight behind you). Waves can easily throw the boat off course by
10 or even 20 degrees, so in heavy air, keep the boat on a broad reach.
Using an engine
One way to handle your boat in heavy weather is to use the engine. You may
even drop all sails and just use the engine alone. You may want to consider
using an engine only when you must head on an upwind course. Otherwise,
sailing is probably faster and easier on the boat and crew. If you have a reli-
able engine that’s easy to use, consider these pointers before you use the
engine in heavy weather:
 Consider motorsailing. When your destination is to windward, the best
tactic may be motorsailing, in which you keep up a reefed mainsail or
small jib and use the motor at the same time. Motorsailing still provides
some power from the sail. Plus, if your engine fails, doesn’t have enough
horsepower, or runs out of gas, the last thing you want to do is try to
hoist the sails while wallowing about.
 Don’t let the boat heel too far. If you motorsail, the heeling force of the
wind may cause the boat to heel so much that the cooling-water intake
comes out of the water, which causes the engine to overheat. Other sys-
tems on the engine may not like excessive heel either — keep an eye on
the engine’s vital signs, including the temperature dial and the cooling
water coming out of the exhaust.
129
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

 Make sure all lines are out of the water before starting your engine.
And keep those lines out of the water; nothing ruins your day faster than
having a jib sheet or halyard tail get wrapped up in a propeller. For tips
on solving that mishap, see Chapter 14.
Reducing your sail power
The force of the wind increases by the square of the velocity, which means
that at 14 knots, the wind force on your rigging and sails is double the load
on the boat at 10 knots. And that’s before you add in the effect of the waves.
Sailboats and their component parts can only stand so much load before
they begin to break. And as we point out earlier in this section, stronger
winds make your boat and sails more difficult to handle. As the wind speed
increases, anything you do to reduce the forces on the boat in strong winds
can make a big difference.
The first way to reduce the load is to depower your sails. We cover that sub-
ject in depth in Chapter 12. The next step is to reduce the boat’s sail area, or
to shorten sail. You can shorten sail in three ways: by dropping a sail, reefing
a sail, or changing to a smaller sail. All three methods have their pros and
cons, depending on the boat and the conditions.
Dropping a sail
Dropping a sail is a pretty extreme tactic on a catboat (which has only one
sail), but sailors commonly use this tactic on sloops of all sizes. Should you
drop the mainsail or the jib? The answer depends on the boat and the condi-
tions. Dropping the jib and sailing with the mainsail alone is appropriate
under the following conditions:
 When the jib is very large. Dropping a genoa (large, overlapping jib) sig-
nificantly decreases your sail power.
 When the boat handles well with the mainsail alone. For more on boat
balance, see Appendix C.
 When your boat has a roller furler (see Chapter 4). Rolling the jib part-
way is really easy; see whether that setting works, and then roll it up all
the way if necessary. Do this as an interim step as the wind builds, and
then plan what your next move is going to be.
Sometimes, however, dropping the mainsail and sailing with the jib alone is
appropriate, as in the following situations:
 On dinghies that are rigged in such a manner that dropping the jib
causes the standing rigging to loosen dramatically.
 On many boats, the jib has less area than the main, so in extreme condi-
tions, such as squalls, dropping the mainsail may be better because the
reduction in sail area (and thus load on the boat) is more dramatic.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

As you lower either sail, keep it under control, bunched up so that it doesn’t
blow around, until it can either be stuffed down below deck or lashed down
on deck securely with ropes so that it can’t flog about.
If you must send the crew to the foredeck for a sail change in rough seas, turn
the boat onto a very broad reach or run (no accidental jibes, please) to reduce
heel. Then everyone on deck can move around on a relatively flat surface. Of
course, if your destination is upwind, you’ll be going away from it at a pretty
fast clip.
Turning downwind can also steady the boat’s motion to enable a crew
member to work up the mast. Once when I was skippering Courageous, Ted
Turner’s famous 12-Meter in Perth, Australia, the mainsail got stuck at the top
of the mast — the crew couldn’t lower it. We had to send a crew member 90
feet up in the air to fix the problem. The wind was blowing 28 knots, and the
waves were steep and choppy. We knew that he couldn’t fix the problem and
brace himself from the pounding on an upwind course — the length of the
mast accentuated the boat’s motion too much. So I had to turn downwind to
level the boat and smooth out the ride. Still, he needed nearly 25 minutes to
solve the problem; by then we were almost 4 miles farther from home. But at
least he was safe!
Reefing
Reefing is a system of reducing a sail’s exposed area. Reefing a mainsail
requires special equipment on the mainsail and boom. You can reef some jibs
by rolling the sail up partway on a roller furler. Most dinghies and many small
keelboats don’t have the special equipment to reef. When reefing is an option,
you perform it as an intermediate step (as the wind becomes stronger) before
dropping a sail. An old saying is still as valuable today as it was in the days of
the square riggers: “When in doubt . . . reef ’er.”
If your sails can be reefed, make sure to rig the lines and equipment used to
reef the sails as soon as the breeze starts to pick up or, even better, before
you leave the dock if any chance exists that you’ll need to reef.
Reefing the mainsail
Reefing the mainsail entails lowering it partway and attaching it by a “new”
tack and clew. The reefing system we discuss here is also called slab, tie-in, or
jiffy reefing. Here are the key components, some of which appear in Figure 7-1:
 Boom lift: Also called a topping lift, this line or wire holds the boom hori-
zontal when the mainsail is partially lowered. Some boats employ a solid
boom vang to keep the boom up instead.
 Reefing line: This strong line is led through a system of pulleys to the
back of the boom and up the mainsail leech to the heavily reinforced
clew cringle (the aft-most reef point).
 Reef points: The mainsail usually has one or more horizontal rows of
these reinforced holes built in.
131
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

Some boats also have a tack horn, a strong metal hook, or other means of
securing the tack cringle (the forward-most reef point) near the gooseneck.
To reef a mainsail, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the reef line is properly rigged.
Perform this step before you set sail. Feeding the reef line through the
clew cringle after the mainsail is hoisted can be difficult.
2. Have the helmsman steer a steady course.
Close-hauled or close-reaching is preferable because the mainsail drops
more easily.
3. Take the slack out of the boom lift and cleat it (tie it off securely).
This action keeps the boom from falling into the cockpit and causing all
sorts of mayhem when you lower the mainsail. If your boat has a solid
vang that supports the boom, you can skip this step.
4. Ease the boom vang and mainsheet until the main is fully luffing.
The main should luff throughout the reefing procedure to reduce the
pressure on the sail so that you can lower and reef it easily. If possible,
conduct all reefing activities from the windward side to minimize the
danger of getting hit by the swinging boom.
5. Partially lower the main halyard — slowly.
Gather the dropping luff until the person standing at the mast can secure
the tack cringle into the tack horn (or alternate arrangement near the
gooseneck) to effectively create a “new” tack for the sail.
6. Rehoist and tension the main halyard.
Feed the luff carefully into the mast and tension it very tightly.
7. Tension the reef line and cleat it securely.
On a boat longer than 20 feet (6 meters) or so, the reef line needs a
winch to get sufficient tension. The reef line should pull the “new” clew

cringle down to within an inch or two of the boom and aft toward the
end of the boom.
8. Trim the mainsheet to fill the sail and ease the boom lift.
9. Tie up the middle of the lowered sailcloth.
This step is optional, but it aids in your visibility and makes the boat
look neater. We recommend using bungee cord to lace up the middle reef
points. Then if the reef line breaks or slips, the sail doesn’t shred.
You can see a properly reefed main in Figure 7-2.
Some mainsails have more than one set of reef points. Which set you use is
determined by how small you want your mainsail to be. The first step down
in size is the first reef; the next step down is the second reef. Very few main-
sails have more than two sets of reef points, unless they’re designed for
extreme ocean sailing.

Reefing the jib
Occasionally, you may find a jib with reef points, just like a mainsail. The
most common (and easiest) way of reefing the jib is with a roller furler, but as
the sail rolls up, it loses its designed shape. (In Chapter 12, we discuss the
importance of sail shape.) So the only racing boats that rely on a roller furler
for reefing are the shorthanded round-the-world boats — no one in his or her
right mind wants to go up to the bow and change jibs or wrestle a sail back
on board when alone in a 60-knot storm in the Southern Ocean.

Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

Changing down
Another way to reduce sail area is to switch to a smaller jib, if your boat has
more than one. Most dinghies and small keelboats come equipped with only
one jib. But as keelboats increase in size (longer than 25 feet, or 8 meters),
many of them have an extra sailbag or two in the cabin. These bags (and the
corners of the sails in them) should be clearly marked. On a large race boat,
generally, jibs are numbered 1 through 4, with No. 1 for light air and No. 4 for
heavy air. The process for changing a jib while under way can be as easy or
as difficult as you make it. Here’s the easy way:
1. Turn the boat downwind onto a very broad reach to flatten the boat
and make moving around on the foredeck easier for the crew.
2. Lower the old, bigger jib and fold it (check out Chapter 15).
Bag it and put it down in the cabin.
3. Rig the new, smaller jib (refer to Chapter 4).
4. Hoist the new jib.
Crank the halyard good and tight.
5. Bring the crew back into the safety of the cockpit and then turn onto
your desired course, trimming the sheet accordingly.
For most sailors, sail changes are few and far between. A corollary of the
“when in doubt, reef ’er” policy is to err on the side of putting up too small a
jib initially — especially in a building breeze.
When reducing sail, reducing too much sail is okay and considered prudent
seamanship. Even if you can sail the boat in the present conditions with a
double-reefed main and a small jib, deciding to lower the mainsail and sail in
to shore at half-speed under jib alone is perfectly all right.
Recovering from a Capsize
The main safety concern on a dinghy is capsizing, or having the boat flip over. If
you’re sailing a keelboat, you can skip right to the section “Staying on Board,”
because that lead keel keeps you from capsizing. For you dinghy sailors, cap-
sizing can be a nuisance, but don’t fear it — it can also be fun and should be
part of every sailor’s introductory dinghy-sailing lesson. Given proper prepara-
tion and practice, you can easily handle a capsize.
When the boat flips upside down, all the loose gear in the boat floats away
(or sinks), so always make sure that everything is well stowed or tied into the
boat — including the daggerboard and rudder.
134
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Centerboard boats fall into two categories with respect to capsizing:
 Those that the crew can right by themselves (self-righting)
 Those that swamp, or fill up with water, and may require outside 
assistance
The difference is in the design of the boat and whether it has sealed flotation
tanks. All modern dinghies are designed to be self-righting — assuming that
you drained the flotation tanks and the hull before sailing and made sure that
all drain holes were plugged before sailing. Avoid sailing in a boat that
swamps when no rescue powerboat is available. Catamarans don’t swamp,
but they can be tricky to get upright. For tips on getting a catamaran up after
a capsize, see Chapter 11.
The anatomy of a capsize
A boat can capsize while sailing by tipping over to leeward or to windward. A
leeward capsize is common in strong or puffy winds, where the boat simply
heels too much and blows over, as Figure 7-3 shows. A windward capsize,
also called a death roll, can occur in strong winds when you’re sailing down-
wind. The boat just starts rolling back and forth until, finally — crash! Sounds
ominous, but you’re just going to get wet.
Righting the boat
When sailing a dinghy, the question isn’t if you’re going to capsize but when.
After you capsize, the sooner you start righting the boat, the quicker and
easier the recovery. If you dally, the boat may keep rolling until the mast is
straight down. This position is called turning turtle, because the hull of the
boat looks like a turtle shell. Righting a boat that has turtled is much harder
than righting one that’s on its side. So the minute you capsize, you need to
quickly hustle through the following steps (shown in Figure 7-4):
1. Ensure that your crew is safe and happy (well, relatively).
2. Get weight on the centerboard as quickly as possible, either by climb-
ing over the high side or swimming around.
Don’t delay, or you may risk making the boat turn turtle.
3. Make sure that all sheets are uncleated and loose.
If you don’t loosen the sheets, the sails fill as you right the boat, and you’ll
probably capsize again. You can lean over the hull to watch and talk to the
crew, who should be swimming in the water while performing this step
and then waiting in the water to climb aboard (see the next step).
135
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

4. While standing on the centerboard, pull on the rail (edge) of the boat
and pump your weight to get the mast to come out of the water.
By holding onto the hiking straps in the cockpit, your crew can get
scooped into the boat as it comes upright. Having their weight in the
boat as it comes up also helps prevent capsizing again immediately (a
very common occurrence, especially if the mast is to windward).
5. When you’re upright, help each other on board while the sails luff.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Always get all your crew on board the boat as soon as you’re upright. Just let
the sails luff; you can worry about getting going again after everyone is safe
and you check over the boat.
Sometimes, especially in wavy conditions, righting the boat is difficult
because the waves keep trying to turtle the boat. One very effective technique
Figure 7-4:
Getting your
boat upright.
137
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

of righting the boat under these conditions is to have the swimming crew hold
onto the bow. The boat naturally drifts with the wind until the bow points
directly upwind. With this technique, the crew keeps holding onto the bow
until the boat is upright.
If you can’t pull the boat upright by yourself, get the crew to provide more
righting force by climbing up on the centerboard and leaning out together, as
Figure 7-5 shows.
Rescuing a swamped boat
Dinghies that swamp are much more time consuming to get sailing again, 
and doing so probably requires outside assistance. So never sail a boat that
swamps without other boats around, and always make sure that you have a
good bucket, or bailer, or two aboard in case you flip. Tie in these bailers so
that you don’t lose them when the boat rolls.
If you capsize in a swamper, you must first uncleat the sheets and bring the
boat upright by pulling on the centerboard. Then climb into the boat over the
transom so that the boat doesn’t capsize again, and start bailing like mad. If
you’re fast and you keep the boat upright, you can usually slowly gain on the
flood waters and get the boat dry. But be forewarned: A boat half filled with
water is very unstable and can flip again easily.
A much easier way to bail out the water is a quick tow from a motorboat. A
motorboat with a well-secured tow rope can slowly pull the boat so that the
water flows out over the transom. Keep your weight low and in the transom.
Soon the water level will be down to a level that you can bail out with your
Figure 7-5:

138
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

bucket. Some dinghies have cockpit self-bailers that you can open to help
drain the water, but they only work if the boat is moving.
If you capsize and can’t right the boat, or you find yourself in the water with
your boat swamped, stay with the boat. The boat is like a huge life ring, and
you’re much safer with the boat than without it. If the boat has turtled, try 
to get out of the water by sitting on the overturned hull and wait for help. 
If you’re in the water tangled in lines, stay calm and untangle yourself.
Staying on Board
If you sail long enough, you’re probably going to fall overboard sometime.
(We both have!) Rule No. 1 for staying on board is to hold on. The old saying
“one hand for the boat, one hand for yourself” is just as true today as in the
days of square riggers. You’re responsible for your own safety first, and you
never know when a wave or a gust of wind is going to take away your footing.
Here’s a basic rule that hopefully scares you into holding on for (shall we
say) dear life. The U.S. Coast Guard calls it the 50-50-50 rule — if you’re in 50-
degree Fahrenheit (10-degree Celsius) water for 50 minutes, you have a 50
percent chance of survival. You lose body heat quickly in cool water, and as
the body cools, its functions shut down. The medical term for loss of body
heat is hypothermia, and it can occur even in 70-degree Fahrenheit (21-degree
Celsius) or warmer water. See Appendix B for tips on treating hypothermia.
In order to stay on board, keep the following tips in mind:
 Hold on. Remember, “One hand for the boat, one hand for yourself.”
 Consider safety when deciding where to sit. The cockpit (if you stay
below the path of the boom) is usually one of the safest places. For a
review of the danger areas on a boat, see Chapter 4.
 Be ready for anything. Wind and waves can toss a boat about in any
direction, or a boat can come to an abrupt stop if it runs aground.
 Bend your knees for better balance if you must stand. Doing so lowers
your center of gravity and lets your legs act as shock absorbers.
 When moving from the cockpit to the mast or foredeck (or vice versa),
take the path along the windward side. The lifelines or some other
solid object, such as a handrail or the shrouds, provide extra support so
you adhere to rule No. 1 mentioned earlier in this section.
Lifelines need regular inspection for rust and wear. Relying on a lifeline is
convenient but can be risky if they aren’t well maintained. If the water is
really wavy and rough, use a solid object inboard of the rail for support.
139
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

 Never hold onto running rigging (lines used to trim sails), whether it’s
in use or not. If the line is let out, you lose your hand hold and your bal-
ance (and in the worst case, your hand could get sucked into a block).
 Sit down with your feet braced. This is the best position to work when
out of the cockpit (that is, on the foredeck). If the water is too rough to
walk around on the deck, you can crawl or even slide on your bottom to
move around safely. And if conditions are that rough, definitely wear a
life jacket and possibly a safety harness (see Chapters 3 and 14).
 Wear nonskid shoes to provide traction. However, even with the best
shoes, decks can be slippery.
 If you’re steering and want to tack or jibe, make sure the rest of the
crew is ready for the maneuver before turning the boat. In strong winds,
hearing someone can be difficult if you’re at the other end of the boat.
Rescuing a Man Overboard
Obviously, men, women, and children fall overboard, but “man overboard” 
is the hail that most people remember from the old movies, and it’s still the
standard hail when someone goes into the drink.
We know that all this talk about falling overboard must sound melodramatic,
but going for an unexpected swim is probably the biggest danger facing the
sailor. You and your crew need to prepare to deal with such a situation before
it happens. Waiting until someone is actually in the water is too late.
Avoiding this situation by staying on board is the best advice. Wearing a life
jacket can help you if you fall overboard, but the key to your rescue is how
the rest of the crew on the boat responds.
Successfully retrieving someone from the water involves four key steps. The
following sections discuss each step of a man-overboard drill in detail. The
steps assume you’re sailing a larger keelboat, but most of the principles apply
equally well on any boat.
Each of these steps requires practice so that the crew works together to com-
plete them automatically in an emergency. You and your crew can practice by
retrieving a hat. If you get sunburned in the time you take to get your hat back,
you probably need more practice (and more sunscreen). For someone head-
ing offshore, we recommend taking the Cruising World or U.S. Sailing “Safety at
Sea” courses. You can find courses in your area at your local marine store or
www.ussailing.org. For a great review, rent or buy the Annapolis Book of
Seamanship series “Safety at Sea” video.
140
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Step 1: Keep the swimmer in sight
If you see someone fall overboard, yell to alert the rest of the crew to the
emergency, but don’t take your eyes off that person. You’re now the desig-
nated spotter. If for some reason, you can’t perform that job (say, you’re dri-
ving), make sure that someone else is spotting before you take your eyes off
the swimmer. If you lose sight of the person, finding him again in the shadows
and reflections of the waves can be very difficult. While you’re watching, try
to reassure the swimmer by shouting encouragement like, “I see you. We’re
stopping the boat; don’t try to swim to us — we’ll be right there.” Pointing at
the person helps, too (in case you momentarily get distracted). Tell the helms-
man how far away and in what direction the swimmer is located. Make sure
you tell the helmsman every few seconds using clear terms such as, “three
boat lengths, off the starboard quarter.”
Many bigger boats carry Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation units. If
someone is near the GPS when a person falls overboard (many boats have a
waterproof unit right on deck), that person should immediately punch the
button that saves the present location. Many GPS units have a special man-
overboard button, which you can push to save the location of the swimmer.
The GPS then shifts modes to help you navigate your way back to the victim.
For more information on using a GPS, see Chapter 9.
Step 2: Throw the swimmer the life ring
Quickly getting the life ring or other Type IV personal flotation aid to the swim-
mer so that he can easily stay afloat is crucial (check out Chapter 3 for more on
the specific types of flotation devices). If you’ve gone swimming fully clothed,
you know how hard treading water can be, and doing so is even harder in big
waves. Often, these life rings have a flag that makes keeping the swimmer in
sight easier. Survival Technologies’ “Man Overboard Module” (MOM) products
have an inflatable life ring, flag, light, and sea anchor all contained in a small
package that easily mounts on the lifelines.
Aim your throw slightly upwind of the swimmer so that the float drifts to him.
Also, you can probably throw the life ring farther by throwing underhand.
If you’re the only person on deck, you must throw the swimmer the life ring
while you keep him in sight — another reason why the life ring and safety
gear need to be within easy reach.
Even at the relatively slow boat speeds of 4 or 5 knots, every second moves
the boat away from the swimmer. If the safety gear isn’t readily at hand,
launching a nonthrowable personal flotation device or nearly anything with
lots of flotation is better than waiting until you’re too far away to get some-
thing within easy reach of the swimmer.
141
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

Step 3: Stop the boat
Stop the boat immediately (as soon as practical) to minimize the distance 
to the swimmer. Some sailing books and schools teach a time-honored man-
overboard procedure called the figure-eight method (shown in Figure 7-6),
where the boat sails away from the swimmer on a reach and then tacks and
reaches back to perform the rescue. The best angle to return to the swimmer
is a close reach (with the wind forward of 90 degrees). Although this system
gives the crew time to calm down and line up for a good approach angle
(close reach) back to the swimmer, this system has two shortcomings: the
distance you have to sail away and the difficulty for inexperienced crews to
judge the proper angle of return and speed of approach.
Another rescue technique, called the Quick-Stop method, could be called Man
Overboard For Dummies, as Figure 7-7 shows. It’s an effective technique, even
for inexperienced crews, because you just leave the jib cleated and the main
luffing. The biggest advantage of the Quick-Stop method is that it keeps the
boat closer to the person in the water so that you can keep him in sight more
easily — and (hopefully) rescue him more quickly.

142
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

If you have only a main and jib set, here’s the procedure for a Quick-Stop
rescue:
1. Yell “man overboard,” throw the life ring, and keep the swimmer in
sight.
2. Immediately tack the boat, leaving the jib sheet cleated so that it
backs (fills on the back side).
The backed jib helps pull the boat around onto the new tack. See
Chapter 5 to brush up on basic sailing skills.
3. If you have sufficient crew, drop the jib while bearing away so you
have one less sail to deal with during the recovery.
4. Approach the swimmer slowly, using the mainsail to control your
speed.
5. Try to stop the boat to windward of the swimmer.
The wind blows your boat toward the swimmer, and you can pull the
swimmer aboard more easily on the leeward side.
6. Pull the swimmer aboard.
When the spinnaker is set (or any time you’re sailing downwind when
there is a man overboard), the Quick-Stop method may seem a bit
extreme, but on most boats it’s still considered the best way to go. The

crew eases the spinnaker sheet immediately, and then the helmsman
swiftly spins the boat toward the wind, collapsing the spinnaker and
then the crew drops it to the deck — the sooner after the splash the
better. But the advantage of the Quick-Stop method remains constant —
you stay near the swimmer. We strongly recommend practicing this
technique with the crew first, because you need teamwork to get the
spinnaker cleanly and swiftly stowed away so the boat is ready to make
the recovery. The danger in this situation is that the boat travels so far
downwind that it’s difficult to sail back upwind to the swimmer with just
the mainsail set — hence the importance of practice (and the usefulness
of an engine).
You can also use the boat’s engine, if you have one, to get back to the swim-
mer more quickly. Just make sure that you pull all lines out of the water
before starting the motor, because getting a line wrapped around your pro-
peller stops the engine. When you get close enough to the swimmer to pull
him back on board, put the engine in neutral so as not to endanger him with
the propeller.
Regardless of the technique you use, practice the man-overboard procedure.
These man-overboard routines are designed for larger keelboats, but if you’re
sailing on a dinghy or small keelboat and drop someone overboard, the gen-
eral principles still apply. You may not have a life ring to throw to the victim,
so getting back to him quickly is crucial.
Step 4: Get the swimmer back on board
In some cases, the swimmer is able to climb aboard and is more embarrassed
than anything else. Many times, though, getting the swimmer back on board
can be the most difficult part of a rescue, especially if he is injured. You don’t
want the swimmer to get overly tired trying to swim back to the boat, so
always plan on coming to him. Approach the swimmer so that he is to leeward
of the boat. This way, if you’re a little too cautious (which is better than being
a little too daring) and end up too far windward (upwind), the boat simply
blows down to the swimmer. Plus, tossing the swimmer a line is easier when
you’re throwing downwind.
When the swimmer is within range, throw him a rope (preferably with yet
another flotation aid attached). After you get him alongside, you probably
need a group effort to heft him aboard, grabbing him under the armpits for
the big pull. Of course, if you suspect that this lifting motion may aggravate
an injury, you may have to get creative to make the retrieval as easy as possi-
ble on the swimmer.
Improved man-overboard equipment is constantly being tried and evaluated.
One of the best items is the Lifesling (a trademarked name for a floating
horseshoe-like collar with a polypropylene “tow” line attached). By driving 
144
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

in a circle around the swimmer, towing the Lifesling, you make grabbing hold
of the Lifesling easy for him (similar to a fallen water skier grabbing the ski
rope — but please keep the speed slow!). The swimmer can put the collar
under his arms to facilitate lifting him aboard. If you don’t have a Lifesling,
you can improvise by tying a large bowline in a loop and throwing that line in
the water. The swimmer puts the loop under his armpits, and you can winch
him up to the boat or even on deck if you run the take-up line to a halyard. Or
you can tie a loop in a line, and the swimmer can use the cleated line as a
step up. Then you can haul him on board.
If the swimmer is unconscious or is having trouble staying afloat, you may
have to send someone into the water to help with the rescue. But don’t
double your trouble. Before anyone else jumps in the water, make sure that
the second person has adequate flotation and, if practical, a line securing him
to the boat.
One good reason to practice man-overboard drills and discuss them with your
crew is to decide in advance the best place to get back on board your boat.
Don’t use the back end (transom) of the boat in any kind of rough seas — as
the boat bobs in the waves, the transom slams into the water and can seri-
ously injure a swimmer.
Staying Calm If You Fall Overboard
If you fall off a boat, your first reaction may be anger and embarrassment. But
you need to stay calm and focused to maximize your rescue chances. We have
a friend whose boat sank off the Carolina coast nearly 100 miles offshore. He
survived nearly 24 hours afloat, but other crew members didn’t. He credits his
good fortune to his attitude and mental state. In case you go overboard, even
for a few minutes, this section contains some important survival tips.
Conserve energy
The biggest mistake that people make when they fall overboard is exhausting
themselves by trying to swim back to the boat. Unless you can easily reach a
nearby boat, person, or floating object (like a Type IV life ring), try to con-
serve energy rather than expend it. Swimming toward the wind and waves is
very difficult.
Maximize buoyancy
Your first priority, if a floating object is nearby (hopefully the Type IV life ring
thrown by your crew), is to swim to it and hold on. Some boating reference
145
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

books say that your clothing won’t affect your buoyancy in the water, and
clothing certainly helps keep you warm. But we’ve seen T-shirts sink in the
water, and certain clothing (especially footwear) severely restricts your abil-
ity to swim or tread water. So you may want to kick off your shoes and excess
clothing. Discard any heavy objects — with the exception of a knife, in case
you need to cut away lines, and a waterproof flashlight, for signaling res-
cuers. A swimming lifesaving course (check with your local YMCA or Red
Cross) can provide excellent information on staying afloat.
You can trap air in your jacket or foul-weather pants to help you float. By
sealing all but one opening of a waterproof piece of clothing and then holding
the one opening wide to catch air, you can turn this gear into a (leaky) bal-
loon that can help provide support.
The first time I ever sailed at night on the ocean was a thrilling but also some-
what scary experience. Because I was worried about falling overboard, I put a
waterproof pocket-sized strobe light in my pocket. That way, if I did go over-
board, my team would have a better chance of finding me. Even today, I never
sail at night without at least a flashlight in my pocket. My friend Cam Lewis,
who has raced twice around the world on big high-speed catamarans, has his
own pocket EPIRB (an emergency radio beacon that sends an SOS signal out
to satellites and airplanes) that he carries in his pocket. (Check out Chapter
14 for more info on EPIRBs.)
Conserve body heat
Because hypothermia is a very real threat, even in moderately cool water,
conserving body heat is important. Here are some tips for staying warm:
 Get as much of your body out of the water as possible. At the least,
keep your head out of the water.
 If you’re in the water with other people, huddle together to keep
warm. Huddling also helps keep everyone thinking positively.
 Keep your body in a compact shape. A very compacted shape is the
fetal position, also called the “Heat Escape Lessening Position” (HELP).
With a life jacket on, you can usually stay in the HELP position with your
head out of the water. If this position brings your head under water, try
keeping your arms and legs together to conserve as much warmth as
you can.
 Tighten your life jacket. A snug fit helps keep you warm.
In Appendix B, we cover basic first aid afloat, including ways to warm
hypothermia victims.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Catching a Tow
At some point in your sailing career, you’ll probably be forced to accept a 
tow from a powerboat. But any time you put your boat’s fate in the hands of
another boater (which is the case in a tow), you take a risk. In order to make
your towing experiences as carefree as possible, read the following tips:
 Don’t take a tow unless you need one.
 Use a good rope. An anchor line is an ideal tow line because it’s long,
strong, and stretchy — all good things for towing. (For more about lines,
see Chapter 15.)
 Attach your tow line securely. If the loads are moderate (you aren’t in
heavy weather and you’re not aground), tie your tow line to a secure
object. The mast is usually best. Tie it as low as possible around the
mast, just above the cabin top or deck. If you’re concerned about stress
and expect extreme loads on the tow line, you can spread the load on the
tow line to several places, such as the mast and two cockpit winches, as
Figure 7-8 shows. Make sure that the rope isn’t chafing anywhere.
 Use good knots. Two (or three) round turns around the mast secured with
two half hitches are the best. See Chapter 19 for how to tie that knot.
 Make sure the boat and crew are ready before speeding up. Ask the
tow boat captain not to accelerate until he or she sees a “thumbs up”
from you — and then, he or she should increase speed slowly until you
give an “okay” sign.
 Make sure you can get free in a hurry. If the powerboat captain is a
yahoo, you want to be able to free your boat quickly. A sharp knife
works (on the line, that is, not on the yahoo). You may be able to untie
the round turns and half hitches in a hurry, even when they’re under
load. So don’t use a bowline knot; you won’t be able to free it easily.
 Stay away from the tow line. The line can break and whip back.
 Don’t tow too fast. Arrange a comfortable speed with the tow boat
ahead of time and fine-tune that speed with hand signals if necessary.
 Slow down in waves. Big waves can add tremendous load, so watch for
ones that can surprise you, such as the wake of a ship. If practical, the
tow boat should slow down and turn toward the wake to minimize its
effect on your boat.
 Adjust the length of the rope to go downhill. When you get to a comfort-
able towing speed, you may want to extend the tow rope to its maximum
length to make it easier to steer your boat and to let the stretchy tow rope
cushion your ride. Fine-tune the rope’s length so your bow is pointed
147
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

downhill, riding on the towing boat’s wake, which remains a constant dis-
tance from you. This little trick really eases the load on the tow line. In
most cases, the longer the tow rope, the better (at least two to three of
your boat lengths). The only exception is in confined places where tight
maneuvering requires a shorter tow line (and slower tow speed).
Communicating via the VHF Radio
Our safety chapter wouldn’t be complete without a discussion of how to call
for help. You probably want to go sailing to get away from phone calls, faxes,
and e-mails, but in an emergency, a communication link can be vital. For
coastal sailing, a cellular phone may be your best communication device if it
has the range to connect you to shore. But for safety, we strongly recommend
that you use a Very High Frequency (VHF) radio because the U.S. Coast Guard
and many other boats constantly monitor the VHF (on Channel 16).
VHF radios are simply two-way radios. With a VHF radio, you can get in touch
with the USCG, talk to friends on other boats, listen to marine weather reports,
and even talk to marinas and yacht clubs to inquire about slip space for your
boat. The radio’s range depends on the power of the unit and the height of the
antenna. A hand-held model has a range of a few miles; a 25-watt VHF radio
attached to a masthead antenna on a 40-foot (12-meter) mast has a range of
roughly 10 miles. Put a hand-held radio in a waterproof bag to keep it dry, and
for extended sails, make sure that you have a supply of charged batteries.
You don’t need to register a marine VHF used on a recreational boat in U.S.
waters. But a U.S. recreational sailboat traveling elsewhere must register the
radio and obtain a user license, called an “FRN,” or FCC Registration Number,
from the FCC (http://wireless.fcc.gov).

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Talking on your VHF
Two people can’t talk at once on a VHF radio, so finish your transmission by
saying “over,” let go of the talk button, and listen for a response. Normal
transmissions should not last for more than about 30 seconds.
Here are the common types of radio communications:
 Radio check: Once or twice a year and before a major trip, check your
radio by tuning to Channel 16 and calling “Any vessel, any vessel. This is
the yacht Babbalubba, calling for a radio check. Over.” Don’t waste the
USCG’s time with a radio-check request.
 Ship to ship: For safety and by law in the United States, every vessel
operating a VHF radio must monitor Channel 16 — so when afloat, have
your VHF tuned to Channel 16. Doing so makes good sense because, by
all listening to Channel 16, everyone can help each other as needed. For
general communications, the normal protocol is to first call the other
boat on Channel 16 and then switch to another channel as soon as you
make contact. Remember, Channel 16 isn’t for chatter; make contact
with the other boat and then switch to another channel. Channels 9, 68,
69, 71, 72, and 78 are approved for “intership” communication. You can
surf to http://wireless.fcc.gov/marine/vhfchan1.html for a
full list of VHF frequencies and their designated use.
 Ship to marine telephone operator: Yes, you can connect to a real tele-
phone by calling the marine operators on Channels 24 through 28 and 84
through 87. They instruct you to switch channels after you make contact.
You can call collect or charge your call to your home phone number, but,
obviously, we don’t recommend giving your credit card number over the
radio.
 Ship to USCG — EMERGENCY: The Emergency Channel for contacting
the USCG is Channel 16. See the next section for the proper procedure
during an emergency. Channel 6 is also used for safety and emergency
communication, mostly between Coast Guard boats and planes used in
rescue operations, but if you’re in trouble, make your primary contact
with the USCG on Channel 16, and you’ll be instructed if they want you
to switch.
 Weather information: In the United States, marine weather forecasts
and warnings are transmitted on special VHF weather channels. Check
the radio’s instruction book to find out how to tune to those channels,
or look for a button that says Wx.
149
Chapter 7: Safety: One Hand for the Boat, One Hand for Yourself

Using Channel 16 in emergencies
If you need to make an emergency call on Channel 16 (or SSB Channel 2182,
which we discuss later in this section), follow these steps:
1. If your radio has an alarm signal, press it for 30 seconds (if not, pro-
ceed to Step 2).
2. Say “Mayday” three times and give the name of your boat three times
and your VHF call sign (if you have one) one time.
Then repeat “Mayday” and your boat’s name once.
If you need help, but the situation isn’t an emergency (for example, you
require medical assistance but not emergency evacuation), start your
message by saying “Pan-Pan” (pronounced “Pahn-Pahn”) three times and
then continue with the information we describe in the preceding steps.
3. Give your location, either by the distance from an object on the chart
(for example, “2 miles east of buoy three”) or by latitude and longitude.
4. Explain your situation as briefly as possible, such as “Swamped and
taking on water, in need of tow or rescue.”
5. Tell how many people are on board.
6. Describe the boat’s type, color, and any distinguishing features (“30-
foot dark red ketch with main and jib hoisted”) followed by “over.”
7. After listening for a short period, repeat these steps until someone
responds.
If you hear a mayday distress call, figure out whether you’re close enough to
help by writing down the information and computing your distance. If you
can help, speak on the radio directly to the boat in distress and give your
estimated arrival time. If you can’t help, stay off the radio.
If your boat has a VHF, turn it on and keep it tuned to Channel 16, because
you never know when you may be able to help somebody else in trouble.
Using SSB and satellite radio
If you’re sailing farther offshore (out of VHF range to the shore), you want to
have a Single Side Band (SSB) radio. When properly installed and with a well-
tuned antenna, you can communicate for thousands of miles to other radios
on land and on shore. And with the addition of a modem, you can use the 
SSB to do very low bandwidth e-mail communication. The worldwide distress
frequency for SSB is 2182 kHz. See www.navcen.uscg.gov/marcomms/
high_frequency for more information on SSB frequencies. You must regis-
ter an SSB with the FCC. A marine electronics store can help you, or surf to
http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls.
150
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

But just as cellular phones provide a back-up communication option to VHF
for boaters close to shore, more boats are heading offshore with satellite
radio technology with a growing number of options available. So if you’re
interested in staying in touch either via satellite phone or Internet when sail-
ing offshore or out of cell range, we recommend heading down to your local
marine electronics store to see what’s available. For a low-cost satellite com-
munication option for short trips, a number of our friends have had good
luck renting satellite phones. For more information on marine communica-
tions, surf to www.navcen.uscg.gov/marcomms. But remember, these
satellite phones still should be considered a backup to your SSB for offshore
sailing safety purposes.

eather is important in many sports — you can’t play baseball in the
rain, and players abandon tennis courts when snow is on the ground.
But sailing, more than any other sport, depends on weather, particularly the
wind, for its very existence. Without the wind, you may as well be sitting on a
raft. Fortunately, in most parts of the world, enough wind is available to sail
much of the time.
In this chapter, we talk about sailing’s “playing field” — the wind and the
water. We discuss how to estimate the present wind and water conditions
and how to predict what’s going to happen. Knowing what the weather will
do next makes your sail safer (so you don’t go out when conditions are too
windy), faster (so you pick the fastest course), and more fun (so you get the
best wind for your needs).

Figuring Out How Windy It Is
Sailors around the world (whether they use the metric system or not) mea-
sure the wind speed in units called knots — nautical miles per hour. A nauti-
cal mile is equal to one minute of latitude — one of the horizontal lines on a
chart or globe. (We talk more about latitude in Chapter 9.) A nautical mile is
6,076 feet, or 1,852 meters, 15 percent longer than a statute (regular) mile, so
10 knots of wind equals wind blowing at 11.5 miles per hour. Or if you’re used
to the metric system, 10 knots equals 5.14 meters per second or 18.52 kilome-
ters per hour.
Most sailors ignore the difference between nautical miles and statute miles
and just consider knots to be equal to miles per hour. If you live in a metric-
system country, meters per second times two is close to the speed in knots.
Sailors (and weather forecasters) speak of the wind in terms of the true wind
(the wind that you feel if your boat isn’t moving) speed and direction. Be
aware that when you’re moving, you and your sails “feel” the apparent wind
(the sum of the true wind and the wind created by the motion of your boat).
So even if the wind remains steady, conditions feel windier when sailing
upwind than when sailing downwind. (For more about the difference between
true and apparent winds, check out Chapter 11.)
Fortunately, you have another way to judge wind speed — by looking at the
water. Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort of the British Navy developed Table 8-1 in
1805. He must have been an observant guy (or bored stiff on long sea voy-
ages), and sailors benefit from his perceptions still today. He defined wind
speed in terms of a single number — the Beaufort Force — which is the first
column in Table 8-1. In some parts of the world, weather forecasters still
report marine forecasts in these units, although using knots or meters per
second is more common. An especially cool feature of the Beaufort Scale is
the remarks about the water’s surface shown in the “Water-Surface
Conditions” column.

This relationship between what the surface of the water looks like and the
wind speed really works. Guessing the wind speed every time you go out on
the water is fun — and good practice, too. For example, one of the tips that
always seems to come in handy is the one for Force 4. At around 12 knots, a
few whitecaps are definitely apparent on the surface.
Of course, these descriptions of the water’s surface apply only in areas where
the wavelets and waves have a long enough distance to build up. For winds
up to about 20 knots, that means you need at least a half mile of open water
in the direction the wind is coming from. The water can be glassy smooth
right next to a beach, yet the wind can be blowing 25 knots from an offshore
(from the land toward the water) direction. Places with this unique orienta-
tion to the wind are ideal for setting high-speed sailing records, because
waves usually slow boats down.
Knowing the wind direction is crucial for any sailor. For the many ways to
find the wind direction, see Chapter 5. Wind direction is defined in terms of
magnetic degrees, using the 360-degree compass. If the wind is forecast to be
westerly, the wind is expected to come from the west. If you turn toward the
western horizon, a westerly wind blows straight on your face. You can look at
your compass to determine that direction is 270 degrees. (Find more about
using a compass in Chapter 9.) By paying attention to the wind speed and
direction, you become more aware of the overall weather picture — espe-
cially when you combine that information with the weather forecast.
156
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Getting the Scoop on the Weather
Sailors get their weather information from a variety of sources, and none is
more accurate than their own observation of present conditions. Because the
weather is bound to change while you’re sailing, being concerned with what’s
coming next pays off. Here are some ways to obtain the local marine weather
forecast before you set sail:
 The Internet: The Internet has a vast supply of weather information; you
can find everything from satellite photographs to the local marine fore-
cast — if you know where to look. For forecasts in the United States, a
good place to start surfing is the National Weather Service’s home page
(www.weather.gov). From there, scroll down to find your local marine
forecast and other good links. An increasing number of nonprofit and
commercial weather services are on the Net, some of which specialize in
marine weather. You can find a good list of these links for the United
States and around the world at www.Iexpedition.org/Weather.htm.
Some services (such as www.iwindsurf.com) even provide marine
weather information to an Internet-capable cellphone. For nearly any-
where on the planet, the Internet has resources or links that provide
everything from the wind forecast to the tides. You can try your luck 
on a search engine, or start out at www.weather.gov/om/marine/
internet.htm, which provides many links to the Net’s marine weather
resources.
 VHF radio and telephone: Throughout the United States, the National
Weather Service distributes a marine weather forecast on special VHF
channels reserved for these broadcasts. Wx normally identifies these
channels on the radio dial. The forecasts are updated every few hours
and repeat continuously. In extreme weather, the information may be
broadcast live or updated more often. Valuable information includes
expected wind speeds and directions, warnings regarding fog or large
waves, and weather observations from various stations around the
region. Some National Weather Service offices provide the same marine
forecast on a telephone recording. Surf to www.weather.gov/om/
marine/noaatel.htm for phone numbers.
Outside the United States, check with a local marine business or search
the Internet to find the various Internet, radio, and other sources for
marine weather information.
 News media: Newspapers, television, and AM and FM radio stations all
have some sort of weather information. Many report a marine forecast
for the local waters and show the weather map. Certain satellite radio
stations have excellent marine weather information services as well.
157
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night

The marine weather forecast is the butt of as many jokes among sailors as
the TV weather forecast is around the water cooler at the office. But every
little bit of information helps, and as you gain more experience in a given
area, you develop what sailors call local knowledge — the ability to look at
the clouds and present conditions to forecast the weather.
Ever wonder how sailors on extended offshore voyages outside the range of
VHF radios and cellphones get their weather information? Technology contin-
ues to evolve quickly in this area, but sailors basically rely on two sources for
this information (and for communication and safety, as we mention in
Chapter 7) when in a remote area: radio and satellite.
 Single Side Band (SSB) radio: The U.S. National Weather Service and
other organizations distribute weather information via the SSB.
Broadcasts are by voice, Morse code, and data transmission to a fax
machine. Offshore sailors often use a computer with special radio-fax
decoding software or a stand-alone weather fax receiver that prints out
weather maps and satellite pictures. Surf to http://weather.noaa.
gov/fax/marine.shtml for more information and good links to this
technology and to www.weather.gov/om/marine/home.htm for infor-
mation and links about high-seas radio (voice) forecasts. With the addi-
tion of some hardware and a computer, you can use the SSB to receive
low bandwidth data transmissions, such as e-mail. Some services allow
you to subscribe to receive weather information via e-mail (www.sail
mail.com is Peter’s favorite). Check with your local marine electronics
store or surf to www.weather.gov/om/marine/internet.htm for
links to various providers of this technology.
 Satellite: Sailors have an increasing number of satellite communication
options available to them (normally at a higher cost but higher band-
width than SSB). With these devices, sailors receive e-mail — including
subscribed weather forecasts. Data bandwidth on a sat phone is slow,
but with newer (and more expensive) satellite technology, mariners can
surf the Internet at moderate speeds. Again, the National Weather
Service’s Web site (www.weather.gov/om/marine/internet.htm)
is a great resource for links and information, as is your local marine elec-
tronics store.
When planning a long ocean trip, a pilot chart (available at marine stores) can
be invaluable. These neat ocean charts show wind information averaged over
long periods of time.
Whither the Weather
Although you can use all this weather information at face value, you get more
out of it if you understand some basic principles of why the wind blows.
158
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Many variables affect the weather on both a global and very local basis,
making the science of meteorology quite complex. But the primary forces
that shape weather are temperature differences and air-pressure differences. In
this section, we first look at the big picture of the weather over the planet
and then at the small picture, which is important for your day on the water.
The big picture: Temperature 
and pressure differences
If everywhere on Earth’s surface was the same temperature, you’d see very
few changes in the weather. But because the sun’s rays strike the equator at a
more perpendicular angle than at the poles, a temperature differential results.
On a global scale, this surface temperature differential (hotter near the equa-
tor, colder near the poles), combined with the Coriolis force (a global cen-
trifugal force that we discuss in the sidebar “The Coriolis force,” later in this
chapter), creates belts of weather ringing the globe. Near the equator are the
doldrums — a belt of light, shifty, and unpredictable weather. The tropics enjoy
relatively steady easterly winds (northeast winds in the northern hemisphere,
southeast in the southern hemisphere), dubbed the trade winds. The midlati-
tudes on both sides of the equator are home to the westerlies (winds from the
west), interspersed by waves of low-pressure areas circling the globe.
159
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night
Visual warnings
Some marinas and yacht clubs in the United
States display small-craft warning flags (in
nighttime hours, they may use lights). These
flags, shown in the following figure, are based
on the marine weather forecast and indicate
expected wind strength. The gray-shaded areas
are red in real life.
Small-craft warning
Gale warning
Storm warning
Hurricane warning

Another factor in creating weather is pressure differences. Wind is simply air
in motion trying to get to a position of equilibrium by moving from an area of
high pressure to one of low pressure. On a weather map, pressure is depicted
by lines called isobars, which connect points of equal air pressure. Think of a
weather map like a topographic map, with the areas of high pressure being
mountains, and the places with low pressure being the valleys. Wind flows
around high- and low-pressure areas, moving downhill at a small angle to the
isobars, spiraling clockwise (in the northern hemisphere) out of a high-pres-
sure area and counterclockwise into a low-pressure area, as Figure 8-1 shows.
In the southern hemisphere, the direction of rotation is opposite.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 
The Coriolis force
The fact that the wind doesn’t simply roll
straight down that high-pressure “mountain”
can be disconcerting — and the reason why it
doesn’t is the Coriolis force. Because the Earth
is a huge spinning ball (a very, very huge spin-
ning ball), air molecules heading “downhill”
from a high-pressure area get pulled into a
curve.
No, the Coriolis force isn’t why a baseball
pitcher’s curve ball frustrates batters, and it isn’t
even the reason water spins down a toilet or
sink drain (although your science teacher may
have used that as an example). The Coriolis
force comes into play only on a massive, plane-
tary scale causing the wind to spiral around
high- and low-pressure areas.

The closer together the isobar lines, the steeper the mountain or valley, and
the faster the wind blows. The weather map of a hurricane shows incredibly
tight isobars ringing this immensely deep low-pressure area.
A barometer — a good piece of equipment for a larger cruising boat — mea-
sures air pressure. By paying attention to the changes in pressure, you can
get a better idea of what will happen with the wind, especially if you’re armed
with weather maps and professional forecasts. Here are a few general rules
regarding air pressure and weather:
 If pressure is very high or is going up, the weather is or soon will be
nice. High pressure is associated with clear, dry weather.
 If pressure is very low or is going down, batten down the hatches; you’re
in for a storm. Low pressure is associated with cloudy, rainy weather.
In the temperate midlatitudes on both sides of the equator, weather usually
comes from the west. Even when the local wind is blowing out of the east, 
the huge weather system (high- or low-pressure area) causing that wind is
traveling from west to east, usually around 10 to 15 knots, because the upper
atmosphere in these latitudes is moving quite fast from west to east. The jet
stream (a band of very fast moving air high up in the atmosphere) is part of
this feature. Therefore, pay special attention to the weather on your west
side for an indication of what to expect.
Low-pressure areas and fronts
Nasty, windy, rainy weather is associated with low-pressure areas. A complex
process that involves the meeting of two air masses of different temperatures
creates a low-pressure area, or a low. Emanating from the center of the typi-
cal low on a weather map (and in real life) are often two fronts, a warm front
followed by a cold front, as Figure 8-2 shows. A front is a line separating two
different air masses (warm and cold, moist and dry) and often is distinguished
by a large (more than 20-degree) shift in the wind direction when it passes.
Cold fronts typically pack the most punch and are often the site of the most
extreme sailing weather. Squalls (smaller-scale storms packing incredibly
strong winds delivered down from the upper atmosphere) and even tornadoes
and water spouts (waterborne tornadoes) can occur just before the passage of
the cold front, where warm and cold air meet.
161
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night

The weather around a typical northern-hemisphere low has three distinct
sectors:
 The weather in the area to the north of the warm front is usually
described as “dismal,” where a thick layer of stratus clouds blankets the
entire sky (see “More than cloud gazing,” later in this chapter). If the air
cools enough, you get a steady drizzle or rain.
 The weather in the sector between the warm and cold fronts is warmer
and more humid. A warm, moist wind comes from the south. When the
sun begins to heat the ground, the air near the ground begins to rise,
forming cumulus clouds and, if the conditions are right, thunderstorms.
 The western sector behind the cold front is usually cooler and drier. The
wind is from the west to northwest and can be quite blustery.
In the northern hemisphere, if you stand facing the wind, the center of the
low-pressure system is to your right. In the southern hemisphere, this orien-
tation is the opposite due to the effect of the Coriolis force.
The small picture
Most sailing takes place over the course of a few hours on an area smaller
than 10 square miles (26 square kilometers). A sailor going for an afternoon
cruise is concerned with a much smaller slice of the weather pie than a crew
heading off to set a record sailing around the globe, but both sailors must look
for signs of changing weather. The western sky (in the midlatitudes) is often
the sailor’s most valuable weatherman. This section contains some important
tips to help you predict a change in weather in a few minutes to an hour.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

The following signs indicate a future shift in wind direction or speed:
 A change in the sky. More clouds, fewer clouds, or different kinds of
clouds foretell a shift.
 Sailboats on the horizon. The angle of their sails and their heeling show
the new wind.
 Flags or smokestacks on shore. They provide definitive evidence of a
new wind.
 A rapid change in temperature. Maybe a front is passing through.
 A change in the visibility. For example, in California, if the sky starts to
clear on the horizon, then the wind will come from that direction.
 A change in the water surface. Darker water means waves and more
wind (see the Beaufort Scale in Table 8-1, earlier in this chapter).
 A changing barometer reading. As we describe earlier in this section,
changing air pressure foretells a change in the weather.
The following are the signs of stormy weather approaching:
 Dark, cumulonimbus clouds approaching on the horizon (see the next
section, “More than cloud gazing”).
 Thunder and/or lightning.
 A falling barometer reading.
 A change in wind speed — especially when the wind dies off or blows
gently toward the big, dark clouds.
More than cloud gazing
Clouds are important to a sailor because they can presage a weather change.
Clouds come in all sizes and shapes, but fall into three categories:
 Cirrus: The highest clouds, wispy and thin. They signify fair weather —
for the next day at least.
 Cumulus: Puffy clouds like cotton balls. The associated weather
depends on the clouds’ color and size. Cumulus clouds mean fair
weather when their bases are high in the sky or when they’re relatively
thin and bright white at lower altitudes. The taller (thicker) and darker
ones with low-altitude bases are the cumulonimbus variety, which fore-
tell ominous weather, including sudden thunderstorms.
163
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night

 Stratus: Layered clouds, very even looking from underneath. Stratus
comes from the Latin word for “spread, stretch out, or cover,” which is
what these clouds do. Their associated weather depends on their color,
thickness, and altitude — the lower, thicker, and darker, the more they’re
associated with rain, wind, and (sometimes) low visibility.
Squalls
Thunderstorms, or squalls, are sudden, sometimes severe storms that are
usually localized in size. Although they may precede the passage of a cold
front, they can also be caused by a landmass heating up (with hot air rising
into cooler air aloft) during a sultry summer day. Winds can build to over 60
knots quickly and come from any direction, and lightning is common. Squalls
are relatively unpredictable (unless you have access to weather radar, which
is available on the Internet — for the United States, start at www.weather.gov
and drill into your local area). But dark cumulonimbus clouds, a noticeable
drop in temperature, and distant thunder are all signs that a squall may be
near. Some old salts claim they can smell squalls. We talk more about prepar-
ing for squalls in Chapter 14.
Because sound travels about one-fifth of a mile per second, you can tell how
far away the lightning is by counting the seconds between the lightning and
the thunder and dividing by five. Five seconds means the lightning is about 1
mile away. If you’re metrically inclined, count the seconds and divide by
three to get the distance in kilometers. For example, three seconds means the
lightning is 1 kilometer away.
Facing Up to Fog
Nothing can strike fear (or at least a sober thought or two) in the heart of an
experienced sailor like being caught in a strange area in dense fog. Sure, a
GPS can tell you where you are within a hundred feet, but only if you have the
ability to accurately translate that information onto a nautical chart. When a
bank of fog as thick as pea soup surrounds you, the visibility can literally
drop to less than a boat length, making safe navigation extremely difficult
regardless of your skill and the available navigation aids.
Fog occurs when air contains more moisture than it can hold. When the 
temperature drops below the dew point (the temperature at which the air
becomes saturated with water vapor), the excess water vapor becomes visi-
ble. Fog comes in several different types, but the same condition occurs in
164
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

every kind: Moist air gets cooled (usually by water, which is why fog is more
likely over cold water) until the air temperature drops below the dew point,
and fog appears.
Because fog usually rolls in from the sea slowly, you generally have enough
time after first spotting it to turn around and hightail it back to the shore
before the fog “socks in” completely. For more information about navigating
in fog, see Chapter 9.
Going with the Tide and the Current
The tide is actually a giant wave that circles the globe roughly twice a day. The
gravitational effect of the moon (and, to a lesser extent, the sun) pulls on the
Earth’s oceans and causes two humps, or wave crests — one directly under
the moon and the other on the exact opposite far side of the globe — that
follow the moon in its 24.8-hour path around the Earth, as Figure 8-3 shows.
When the moon lines up with the sun, as it does twice every 291⁄2 days (at the
full moon and the new moon), those global wave crests get even bigger —
and the corresponding trough (low part of a wave) gets even lower. In
between, at the moon’s first and last quarter, the tides are smallest.
165
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night
Ten golden rules of sky watching at sea
Sailors have been watching the sky for cen-
turies. Before the days of weather forecasts,
the seaman that could foretell the weather 
by paying attention to Mother Nature’s signs
had a big advantage. Here are some of those
golden rules that have been passed down over
the ages:
1. Red sky at night — sailors delight; red sky
at morning — sailors take warning.
2. When the sky changes, so will the weather.
3. Mackerel sky — 24 hours dry (high clouds
that look sort of like a bunch of fish scales).
4. Dew on decks — wind from the sea; no dew
on decks — wind from the land.
5. When the wind speed exceeds the temper-
ature, sailors should head for home.
6. A halo around the moon means rain or
snow. The larger the halo, the nearer the
precipitation.
7. Rainbow to windward means rain is
coming. Rainbow to leeward means rain
has ended.
8. The higher the clouds, the finer the weather.
(A lowering ceiling foretells rain.)
9. When smoke descends, good weather ends.
10. Seagull, seagull, sit on the sand; it’s a sign
of rain when you’re at hand.

As this global wave girdles the planet, it creates water motion called tidal cur-
rent, or simply current. Current is moving water, and currents that reach 3
knots or more, rivaling the speed of a small sailboat, aren’t uncommon. That
much current definitely gets your attention! In some narrow bodies of water,
such as the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the current comes in and out like a big
tidal wave at speeds in the teens.
Flood tide is tidal current coming inbound as the tide is on the rise; ebb tide is
the outbound tidal current when the tide is going down. You can discover
tons of information about tides and currents by looking at a nautical chart of
an area. Focus on the underwater topography, because the current runs
strongest where the water is deepest. These general rules about tides and
currents can help you while out on the water:
 Current changes on the beach first. In a confined area like a bay, the
direction of the tidal flow changes with the changing tide near the
shores first and in the middle last.
 Current is visible by watching the water flow past buoys and other
anchored objects.
 Deep water — stronger current; shallow water — less current.
 A knot of current counteracts 10 knots of wind on an anchored ship. If
you see a big ship that’s anchored pointing 180 degrees to the 20-knot
wind, you know that at least 2 knots of current are flowing against the
wind out there.
 Strong winds can overpower weak tidal flows causing them to run
contrary to their predicted direction. Strong winds can even create
windblown current on lakes that have no discernible tide.
 When the wind opposes the current flow, waves get steep and choppy.
This makes for a fast but bouncy ride heading upwind.
 When the wind is with the current flow, the waves get smoother and
more elongated.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

One more type of current is of interest to sailors — the huge continental
boundary currents flowing along coastlines. Two great examples surround
North America. On the west side is the cold, south-bound Alaska current, and
on the eastern Florida coast is the warm, north-bound Gulf Stream current.
These two currents act like strong rivers within the ocean, with average
speeds up to 3 knots. In small, local areas, the speeds can be much higher. A
combination of the Coriolis force, the prevailing winds, and the orientation of
the coastlines cause these two currents.
Understanding Sea Breezes
Temperature differences can also cause changes to the weather on a local
scale. Sea breeze is the name associated with a family of winds generated on
sunny and partly sunny days, when the extra heat of the land causes a cool
breeze to blow inland from the water. In certain parts of the world, the sea
breeze is so predictable during the summer months that you can almost set
your watch by it. Summer sea breezes are common in nearly every coastal
town in the midlatitudes.
Here’s how sea breezes work: As the land heats, the air rises (sometimes cre-
ating puffy, cumulus clouds), and an area of low pressure is created over the
land by midday. Meanwhile, the water remains cooler, and so does the air
above the water. Cool air from the water blows (or, really, is sucked) into the
low pressure over the land. If the conditions are favorable (a light offshore
wind up at cloud level and a large temperature difference between land and
water), the sea breeze can build fairly quickly to 15 knots or more. Figure 8-4
depicts the classic sea breeze.
As the sun drops, the heating of the land diminishes, and so does the sea breeze.
In the northern hemisphere, watch for the sea breeze to build until midafter-
noon and then slowly die away, shifting to the right (clockwise) in response to
the ubiquitous Coriolis force (it shifts left in the southern hemisphere).
167
Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night
The motion of the ocean
If the moon’s pull is constant as it orbits the
Earth, why is the tidal range 15 feet (5 meters)
or more in some parts of the world and only a
few inches in others? The mathematical answer
can make a university student’s head hurt, but
in practical terms, these differences are due to
the shape and proximity of land masses, the
underwater topography, and the wind.
Fortunately, most regions of the world have tidal
predictions readily available in local publica-
tions, so you don’t have to do the math to know
whether the harbor is deep enough for your
boat. In the United States, link to www.
co-ops.nos.noaa.gov for tidal informa-
tion, or listen to the marine-weather radio.

Recognizing Wind Shifts
Airflow over water is always a bit turbulent, so even the “steadiest” condi-
tions have little wind shifts, or changes in the wind’s speed and direction.
When you’re sailing near shore in an offshore wind, the wild shifts in the wind
speed and direction can be downright maddening (although the racers in
Chicago’s downtown Belmont harbor claim they can predict the wind shifts
by watching the doorman open the door at the waterside hotel!). The follow-
ing are some common types of wind shifts:
 Persistent shift: A persistent shift is one where the wind moves in one
direction either very quickly (as in the passage of a front) or progres-
sively (as in the case of a sea breeze gradually trending to the “right”
over the course of the afternoon). The shifts, which weather forecasts
describe, are persistent shifts.
 Oscillating shift: When the wind slowly shifts back and forth around an
average wind direction, you call it an oscillating wind. These sorts of
shifts usually have a period ranging from less than a minute to ten min-
utes or so and are below the scope of a weather forecast.
 Geographic shift: A geographic shift is a shift in direction or speed
caused by land. For example, when the wind channels and accelerates
through a valley or bends around a hill.
Because the crucial first leg of an America’s Cup race can be less than 20 min-
utes, an America’s Cup team focuses its weather experts on trying to predict
very short-term shifts in the wind, which are below the radar screen of most
meteorologists.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Every time the wind changes, the opportunity arises to sail faster or a
shorter course to your destination. A clever sailor can take advantage of
wind shifts, as you see in the next section.
Using Your Weather Knowledge
For safety, know the weather forecast before you sail to avoid going out when
conditions are too windy or stormy. But you can also use your knowledge of
the weather, current, wave conditions, and performance of your boat to pick
the fastest route. The whole process can become quite complicated for a
racer or serious ocean sailor, but here are some good general rules for
anyone trying to get to their destination faster:
 When sailing upwind, sail on the longer tack first (if you have one).
The more “skewed” the course to the destination is relative to the wind
direction, the more important this rule becomes. For example, if the
course to the destination is 10 miles (16 kilometers) on starboard tack
and .5 miles (.8 kilometers) on port tack, definitely go on starboard first
because any wind shift will help you, as Figure 8-5 shows.
 If you expect a wind shift when sailing upwind, sail toward the new
wind first. If your destination is more directly upwind and you expect a
right-hand (clockwise) wind shift (either a persistent or geographic
shift), sail on port tack first. See Figure 8-6.
 Sail on the lifted tack in an oscillating wind. If the wind is going back
and forth, you want to sail on starboard tack when the wind is in its
“right/clockwise” phase and on port tack when the wind is in its “left/
counterclockwise” phase.

Chapter 8: All about Weather: Red Sky at Night

 Get out of the waves: In strong winds sailing upwind, take the tack
toward the windward shoreline (or an area that’s more protected) first
to get out of the waves, which slow your progress sailing upwind.
 On a reach, sail a straight line for your destination, unless
• If the wind is strong and ahead of the beam. Then steer slightly
below (to leeward of) the destination if you expect the wind to
decrease or shift farther behind.
• If the wind is light and behind the beam. Then steer slightly above
(to windward of) the destination if you expect the wind to increase
or shift farther ahead.
In the northern hemisphere, the stronger wind is normally associated with a
shift to the right (clockwise). In the southern hemisphere, the stronger wind
is associated with a shift to the left.
When I’m navigating in an ocean race (say, Los Angeles to Hawaii), I use
weather-routing software to calculate the optimum route to take. This software
takes the forecasted wind and current (available on the Internet as a digital
“grib” file), the boat’s polars (predicted boat speed at various wind speeds
and angles), and the desired destination and then “tries” hundreds or even
thousands of possible routes to figure out which one is fastest. New grib files
are available every six hours, so throughout the race I continually run my
route-optimizing software and study the forecasts to determine the best way
to go. Route planning is part art, part science, and part luck.

N
avigation, as defined in one of Peter’s favorite books (the encyclopedia
of navigation, The American Practical Navigator, by Nathaniel Bowditch,
first published in 1802 and revised periodically by the U.S. Navy), is “the
process of directing the movement of a craft from one point to another.” The
history of navigation is rich with fascinating stories of sailors who crossed
oceans with limited knowledge of where they were and even less of where
they were going. Yet, however crudely, they did successfully direct their
crafts from one point to another and often back again. The lore of navigation
spans the globe. For example, ancient Polynesian navigators had a rich oral
tradition of sailing directions that enabled them to sail to islands well over
the horizon without any instruments.
Advances in timekeeping, technology, basic sciences, and mathematics
enable today’s sailors to direct their “crafts” from one place to another much
more easily and accurately. But despite the satellites in the sky that tell you

where you are, the link with this rich history of navigation isn’t totally sev-
ered. Many of the skills that you will find most practical and easy to use are
ones developed centuries ago.
Using Common-Sense Navigation
Whether you’re sailing across the pond or across the ocean, you need to use
certain basic skills to help you get there. These basic skills involve being
attuned to the elements and using your senses and your judgment to get
where you want to go quickly and safely.
Here’s how navigation skills can help you, even if you’re just heading out for a
short sail:
 Knowing where you are: Asking the birds or fish for directions isn’t easy.
 Getting to your destination: We’re not saying you must always have a
destination — sometimes it’s fun to be spontaneous.
 Getting there as fast as possible: We cover some of the getting-there-fast
issues in Chapters 11 and 12, but the navigator has major input into this
subject. In Chapter 8, we cover ways to use weather knowledge to plan
the fastest route.
 Getting there as safely as possible: Safety always comes first, and again
the navigator may play a role — by avoiding the dangers marked on the
nautical chart to avoid the ignominy of running aground (see Chapter 14)
and by recognizing shipping channels where large commercial vessels
have the right-of-way (see Chapter 4 on the rules of the road).
Although this section is crucial for sailors on a boat with no compass or
chart, these techniques can be equally valuable on bigger boats with all the
navigation goodies.
Judging laylines
When the destination is upwind, so you have to make at least one tack (see
Chapter 5 for more on tacking) to get there, you have to be able to judge the
layline — the line beyond which you can lay (sail to the destination on a
close-hauled course with no more tacks), as Figure 9-1 shows. Sailing past the
layline to your destination isn’t bad — you simply sail extra distance. In
Chapter 8, we discuss the strategy of which tack to take first when sailing in
shifting winds. But after you choose your course (of a series of long tacks or
172
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

many shorter ones), eventually you have to make that final tack. In order to
know where the layline is, you need to know how many degrees your boat
tacks through — the difference between your port and starboard close-hauled
headings. In moderate air (10 to 14 knots), most boats tack through 90 degrees
or a little less. If there is current, you must allow for its effect too (see
Chapter 8 for more about currents).
When sailing upwind and your destination is dead abeam (perpendicular to
the boat’s heading), tack over and see whether you’ve reached the layline.
Holding a steady course
If you can see your destination, steering a straight-line course is usually a
simple matter. But if current is pushing you sideways or your boat is sideslip-
ping excessively due to too much heel (too tipped over, see Chapter 11), your
course over the bottom, or course over ground (COG), is different than your
boat’s heading, or the course the boat is steering. If you’re sailing on a reach,
then you can alter your heading so that the boat “makes good” the course
you want — the straight line to the destination. If you’re sailing close-hauled
and slowly drifting downwind of your desired course, then you aren’t yet on
the layline, and you need to tack at some point to reach your destination.
If land lies behind the destination, you can use it as a range (two objects in a
line) to stay on track, as Figure 9-2 shows. A visual range enables a sailor to
determine whether current or wind is pushing the boat sideways and how
much to alter course to counteract that effect.

Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Avoiding shallow water
If the water is clear and the wind calm, the bottom looks amazingly close
through the magnifying glass of the water. But this visibility decreases when
waves kick up. Use the following tips for avoiding potentially dangerous shal-
low spots:
 Follow another boat. By using another boat (hopefully with a similar or
deeper draft than your boat) as your guinea pig, you can follow directly
behind (at a safe distance so you can turn if it runs aground) and stay in
deep water. This technique is especially helpful when entering a strange
harbor or following a narrow channel (deep water lane).
 Look at the bottom. In the tropics, sandy bottoms get brighter white as
the depth decreases, and coral heads become darker.
 Pay attention to the markers and buoys. Hang on — we discuss the
markers that signal deep and shallow water in the next section, “Relying
on Buoys: Aids to Navigation.”
 Slow down. If you’re in an area where you think that your keel or center-
board may touch bottom, take some pace off. You may not avoid ground-
ing, but at least the contact will be less severe.
 Stay away from the shoreline. By definition, the bottom comes up at
the shoreline, so stay away from the shore unless you’re sure (from look-
ing at a chart or past experience) that the water is deep enough.
 Watch for waves. As every surfer knows, waves break when they reach
shallow water. Beware of an area with breakers or with waves that seem
to “mound up” bigger than the surrounding waves.

Relying on Buoys: Aids to Navigation
Sailors have used visual aids to navigate since time immemorial. A big willow
tree may mark a good fishing spot; a promontory, the entrance to a harbor.
An aid to navigation is any device (not on board) designed to assist you in
determining position or a safe course or to warn of dangers. Around the
world, you find millions of man-made aids to navigation; the most common
are buoys. A buoy is any floating, albeit anchored, object that can be used for
a variety of purposes, including navigation.
Depending on where you are, navigation buoys are laid out in one of two dif-
ferent systems (or a combination of the two):
 Cardinal system: Buoys of specific shapes and colors are laid out to
indicate the compass direction to the hazard. The cardinal points of the
compass are north, south, east, and west; hence the name. Most
European countries use the cardinal system in combination with a lat-
eral system.
 Lateral system: Buoys of specific shapes and colors are laid out along
the edges of the channels or areas of safe navigation. The United States
primarily uses the lateral system, which the U.S. Coast Guard manages.
Not only do buoyage systems vary somewhat from country to country, but
they also vary from region to region in the United States. Fortunately, most of
the country is governed by the U.S. Aids to Navigation System (which uses
the lateral system), with notable exceptions being the western rivers, intra-
coastal waterways, and smaller bodies of water lying totally within a single
state. Conveniently, even those areas use most of the key elements of the 
U.S. system, which we outline in the next sections. You can ascertain all the
important characteristics of a buoy from a nautical chart, as we describe in
“Charts: A Sailor’s Roadmap,” later in this chapter. If you want more details
about all the variations in buoyage systems in the United States, surf to
www.uscgboating.org.
Knowing your colors
The most important characteristic of a lateral-system buoy is its color. You
may already be familiar with the three “Rs” in the expression “red right
returning” (from the sea), which describes the basic rule of the U.S. (lateral)
buoyage system: When you’re coming inbound, entering a harbor, or moving
along a channel toward an area that can be considered more protected, you
keep the red buoys on your right side. Conversely, you keep the green buoys
on your left side. By convention, the red buoys have even numbers painted
on them, and the green ones have odd numbers.
175
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Most experienced boaters use the words port and starboard while afloat. In
their terminology, in the United States, a red buoy should be “left to starboard,”
which means passed on your right side. A green buoy should be “left to port.”
Interestingly, in most of the rest of the world, including Europe, the conven-
tion is exactly opposite. Green buoys have even numbers, and you leave the
green buoys on your right side when entering a harbor.
The concept of red buoys being on the right side when you’re returning from
sea implies that a safe passageway, or channel, is bounded by buoys. If the
“returning” direction isn’t obvious, ask yourself which body of water is most
protected by land or farthest from a bigger body of water. Along the Gulf of
Mexico and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the United States away from
harbors, the red buoys mark shallow spots close to shore.
Identifying the types of buoys
Buoys come in a variety of shapes, which can indicate their meaning, as
Figure 9-3 shows. At night, some buoys display lights to help the mariner find
his way. Typically, the solid red and green buoys, so important in defining a
channel, are lit with corresponding red and green lights. Lighthouses and
midchannel fairway buoys often feature a white light. In the “Navigating at
Night” section, later in this chapter, we discuss how, with a chart, you can
identify a specific buoy from its unique light pattern.
You may encounter the following types of buoys when you’re out for a sail:
 Nuns and cans: The most common buoys (used to mark the edges of the
channel) are the red nuns (named for their pointed, conical top) and the
green cans (named for their cylindrical shape).
 Lighted buoys: Lighted buoys are usually taller than nuns or cans, have
a floating base and a superstructure supported by an open framework,
display a light signal at night, and often emit a sound signal (bell, gong,
whistle, or horn) as the buoy rolls in the waves. If they’re painted solid
red (with a red light at night) or solid green (with a green light), they
signal the edges of a channel, just like their unlighted brethren. Check
out “Navigating at Night,” later in this chapter.
 Junction buoys: Junction buoys can be shaped like a nun, can, or
lighted buoy, but they’re horizontally red-and-green striped. These
stripes indicate the junction of two channels, with the color on top indi-
cating the deeper, or preferred, channel. Red on top means that the
bigger channel is to port (in other words, pass the red-topped buoy on
your starboard side).
176
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

 Midchannel fairway buoys: If unlighted, these buoys are round balls;
otherwise, they’re the shape of a lighted buoy and indicate safe water at
the center (often the beginning) of a channel. They’re vertically striped
red and white.
 Danger buoys: By definition, all navigation buoys mark some sort of
danger. An isolated danger (such as a rock or other hazard) in relatively
open water may be marked by a lighted buoy with red and black stripes
and two black balls at the top. When unlighted, danger buoys can be
either nun- or can-shaped and are white with thin orange horizontal
stripes at the top and near the water level.
Other government buoys can signal an anchorage, quarantine area, fish
nets, dredging operations, or special purpose. Refer to the U.S. Coast
Guard’s Boating Safety Hot Line (800-368-5647) or www.uscgboating.
org for any updates to the description of these buoys.
 Daymarks: Sometimes, in areas protected from waves in relatively shal-
low waters (like rivers and man-made channels), daymarks are used in
lieu of buoys. Daymarks are displayed on poles pounded securely into
the bottom. As with buoys, color is the most important feature. Pass a
triangular red marker with a red reflective border on your right side
when returning from the sea; pass a square green marker with a reflec-
tive green border on your left side when returning from the sea.
With all this talk about red right returning, don’t forget that when you’re leav-
ing a harbor, you pass the red buoys (or daymarks) on your left side!
You may think that this spot is a logical place to talk about GPS and other
electronic aids to navigation, but because these electronic aids require the
use and understanding of a chart, we hold off a few more pages. And the
great thing about buoys is that after you understand the system, buoys help
you navigate even if you don’t have a chart aboard (although navigating is
much easier if you have a chart).

Charts: A Sailor’s Roadmap
Charts are maps for mariners, providing a variety of useful, sometimes invalu-
able information. Anyone can make a chart — even you. But the indisputable
authority of charts in the United States is the federal government. You can
purchase paper charts at most marine stores.
Digital charts (charts that you can display on a computer-type device) are
also available from a variety of sources in a wide variety of formats. We cover
digital charts in more depth in the “Using GPS: Electronic Navigation” section,
later in this chapter. This section discusses good ol’ paper charts, including
how to read them and how to establish a course and range on a chart.
Lining up your latitudes and longitudes
Charts come in a variety of scales (coverage areas). To orient yourself to the
scale of a particular chart, refer to the scale of latitude (horizontal lines on a
chart or globe indicating angular distance — 0 to 90 degrees — north or
south of the equator), which bounds the vertical (right and left) edges of
every chart, as Figure 9-4 shows.
Figure 9-4:

and left
edges of a
nautical

bounded by

178
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

No matter where you are on the planet, one degree of latitude equals 60 nau-
tical miles. (Hang on — we have more about the difference between nautical
miles and statute miles in a minute.) Each degree is divided into 60 minutes,
and each minute is further carved into either 60 seconds or decimal minutes.
You can use this catchy phrase to help you glean distances from the edge of
your chart: “A minute’s a mile the world around.”
Be careful: The same isn’t true of a minute of longitude, which varies in dis-
tance depending on how close you are to the equator. Vertical lines on a
chart or globe indicate longitude, which designates the angular distance (0 to
180 degrees) east or west of the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the
line of longitude (or meridian) that has been arbitrarily given the value of 0
degrees. The prime meridian passes through Greenwich, England — so guess
which country established it!
Latitude and longitude are the navigator’s equivalent of streets and avenues
in Manhattan (where they run north to south and east to west in a grid).
Running at right angles to each other, they provide a universal way of
describing your position. For example, in my chair right now, I am at 32
degrees 43.28 minutes north latitude and 117 degrees 13.26 minutes west lon-
gitude, or 32°43.28’N, 117°13.26’W. Anyone with the correct chart can deter-
mine where I am from those two values.
Deciphering a chart
In addition to latitude and longitude, charts display an enormous amount of
information, often coded by a plethora of symbols and abbreviations. Chart
No. 1 (http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm), pub-
lished by NOAA, explains every one of these symbols and abbreviations —
from the symbol for a pagoda to water depth. Chart No. 1 is an indispensable
aid in finding out how to read a chart and a valuable reference for the saltiest
seafarer. You can purchase a paper version of Chart No. 1 and all U.S. govern-
ment charts from most marine stores. If they don’t have a particular chart,
they can order it. Most marine stores also sell CDs featuring digital charts
that can be viewed on a computer. You can download digital charts at
http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/mcd/raster/download.htm.
Here are some of the most valuable pieces of information displayed on a nau-
tical chart:
 Buoys and other aids to navigation: As we mention earlier in this chap-
ter, buoys come in a huge variety of different colors, numbers and let-
ters, shapes, lights, and sound signals. All those details come clear when
you understand the code.
179
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

For example, “RW ‘SD’ Mo (A) WHIS” written next to a little black circle
surrounded by a solid magenta circle with a split trapezoid peaking out
clearly identifies the location of a red and white whistle buoy, with the
letters “SD” on top, which displays a white light flashing the Morse Code
signal for the letter “A” at night and indicates the middle of the entrance
to the channel coming into San Diego Harbor. See why you need Chart
No. 1!
 Compass rose: The compass rose on the chart helps the navigator
orient the chart to his or her compass. The compass rose is so useful
that several usually appear on a single chart. A compass rose consists of
two concentric circles, each graduated in degrees (0 to 360 degrees) run-
ning clockwise from a reference direction (magnetic or true north). The
magnetic compass rose is the one navigators usually use, and it’s always
the smaller, inner one. The true compass rose surrounds it. Farther
inside the circle is information about the variation (the angular differ-
ence between true and magnetic north) as well as how the variation
changes over time (slowly).
We have to introduce you to a fact that may shake your belief in Santa
Claus. The earth has two north poles. True north sits properly atop the
globe (at 90°N and 0°E). Magnetic north (which magnetic compasses
think is north because of the earth’s magnetic field) is a few thousand
miles away and wanders around a bit because of the molten iron in the
earth’s core. Luckily, because navigators use compasses, they need to
concern themselves only with magnetic north (unless they’re perform-
ing the art of celestial navigation, where true north is king; check out
“Wishing on a Star: Celestial Navigation,” later in this chapter, for more
tidbits on this subject). Unfortunately, some navigators don’t feel the
same way, so when discussing compass directions, always indicate
which reference system you’re using (270°T indicates true degrees, and
270°M indicates magnetic degrees).
 Date of printing: Because important things (such as the position or
description of a buoy) change, having a current chart is important. You
can find the printing date near the corner of the chart, outside the
perimeter of the longitude scale. Old charts make great posters, wallpa-
per, and gift-wrapping paper!
 Depth of the water: Given a navigator’s aversion to running aground,
this is the biggie. Depth at a particular spot appears as a number that
indicates depth below a fixed datum (base value), which is normally
mean low water (the average level of low tide). This number is usually
given in units of feet, fathoms (one fathom equals six feet), meters, or
some combination. The datum and measurement scale (feet, fathoms,
and so on) are indicated somewhere on the chart near the label that
identifies the chart by name. The units of depth measurement are so
important that they’re repeated in magenta ink along the perimeter of
the chart. Contour lines joining places of equal depth help provide a pic-
ture of the underwater topography.
180
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

181
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course
 Hazards: Shallow water is a major hazard, and charts often depict shal-
lower water as a different color than deeper water. Other danger areas,
like rocks that are awash at low tide, have their own special symbols.
Even military target ranges are clearly noted!
 Land: Because most of your sailing is near land, you can take advantage
of the physical characteristics of the shore and any major, charted land-
marks like radio towers and mountaintops indicated for reference.
If you haven’t figured it out by now, we think that charts are pretty cool,
because they possess so much information. Here are some tips on working
with and reading charts:
Using a chart on deck
When you’re navigating your way along a
coastline, you may find having the chart on deck
quite helpful. The downside is that the wind may
blow the chart overboard (not a good thing), and
writing and taking measurements on the chart
can be cumbersome at best. Marine stores
often sell a collection of local charts on water-
resistant paper bound together in a spiral binder
that are more convenient to use on deck (see
large chart booklet in the following figure). But
keep in mind that nothing but a current official
government chart is guaranteed to be up-to-
date and accurate.
Nowadays on racing boats, I use a waterproof
computer screen on deck running a navigation
program that’s interfaced with the boat’s GPS
and instrument system (see the screen in the
following figure). But I still make sure I have all
necessary paper charts on board as a backup.

 Bring Chart No. 1 along. Hey, you can’t tell the players without a pro-
gram, can you?
 Fold the chart to size. Charts are usually much bigger than your chart
table or work space, so fold the chart so that you can easily see the area
you’re interested in. If that area is too big or too small, get the chart
that’s the next size up or down in scale. Make sure that you can see a
compass rose and a portion of the latitude scale (for measuring dis-
tance) when the chart is folded.
 Get the right chart. Before embarking on a trip, go to the local marine
store and check the NOAA Nautical Chart Catalogue for your area. If you’re
traveling some distance, make sure that you have large-scale (close-up)
charts of potential harbors you may want (or be forced) to visit.
 Orient the chart for ease of use. Some people like to rotate the chart so
that the direction they’re traveling is straight up. Peter prefers keeping
true north up, but that’s just his taste.
 Use a pencil. When writing on your chart (perfectly acceptable), use a
pencil so that you can erase your scribbles and reuse the chart.
Measuring a course and range
With the help of a nautical chart (and a tool or two), you can determine the
distance and compass course between any two points on a chart. Our
favorite tools for this job are parallel rulers (two straight-edged plastic slats
connected by two hinges) and dividers (an adjustable metal tool with two
sharp points, like an adjustable “compass” that’s used to draw circles).
To obtain the course and distance between two points, use your tools and
chart, and stick to the following steps:
1. Pick out the two points.
If you like, draw a straight line between them. If you plan on sailing 
along this course, make sure your line doesn’t cross any land or other
obstructions.
2. Lay one long, outer edge of the parallel ruler on the chart so that it
touches both points.
Use the edge farthest away from the compass rose.
3. Find the closest compass rose printed on the chart.
Doing so minimizes your “walking” distance in the next step.
182
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

4. With two hands, “walk” the parallel ruler to the compass rose, moving
one plastic slat at a time and being especially careful that the “other”
(nonmoving slat) doesn’t move at all.
Firmly hold down the nonmoving slat.
5. When the first slat reaches the compass rose, set it so that its long
outer edge crosses the plus sign in the center of the compass rose, and
then read the course in magnetic degrees indicated on the inner, mag-
netic compass ring.
Be careful to read the course in the direction you want to travel and not
the “reciprocal” course in the exact opposite direction.
If you think that the nonwalking slat slipped during the walking process,
do it again. Make sure that the chart surface is absolutely flat and that
the rulers have enough “elbow room” to walk around.
6. Measure the distance.
Use your dividers to compare the distance between the points to the
distance indicated on the latitude scale. Remember, 1 minute of latitude
equals 1 nautical mile. And for marine navigation, we always employ
nautical miles rather than statute miles. A nautical mile equals 6,076 feet
(roughly 6,000 for easy mental calculations), 2,025 yards (roughly 2,000),
1.852 kilometers, or 1.15 statute miles.
Now that you have determined the range and bearing between the two
points, you can use this information for a variety of purposes. But the most
common is to establish a course to steer and to calculate the time it will take
to sail to the destination.
Using a Compass
A compass is a device that feels the pull of the earth’s magnetic system and
provides a reference direction relative to magnetic north. Sailors use several
common types of compasses for navigation and steering:
 Steering compass: Steering compasses are mounted permanently in the
boat, usually in a position so that the helmsman can refer to them when
steering. They come in two basic varieties:
• Binnacle or dome compass: Mounted on a horizontal surface such
as a pedestal or on deck, these are easiest to read and are popular
on boats with steering wheels.
• Bulkhead compass: These are mounted on a vertical surface such
as the back wall (bulkhead) of a cabin and are used on boats that
have no convenient location for a dome compass.
183
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

 Hand-bearing compass: Hand-bearing compasses are small, portable
compasses that aren’t meant to replace a boat’s primarily steering com-
pass. They make taking a bearing (measuring the compass course from
your boat to an object, which we discuss later in this chapter) easier
than with a bulkhead compass.
 Electronic compass: Electronic compasses use the principles of magnet-
ism and electricity. They’re popular in autopilots, in some high-end sail-
ing instrument systems, and even in some hand-bearing compasses. Of
course, never rely solely on an electronic compass — what happens
when the battery runs down?
Accounting for deviation
Unfortunately, all compasses don’t agree as to the direction of magnetic
north. Metal objects (or electrical current) affect the compass’s internal mag-
nets and cause the compass to deviate from magnetic north. To minimize this
divergence, mount the compass far away from potential problems (like the
engine) and never use iron-based fasteners or fittings nearby (within a few
feet). You can determine if a fitting has magnetic properties that would affect
the compass by touching the fitting with a magnet.
No matter how careful you are, some deviation (5 degrees plus or minus) 
is inevitable. So if you plan on using your compass for any sort of serious
navigation, get your compass swung (calibrated for deviation error) by a pro-
fessional. In practice, this involved process is usually reserved for larger
boats (more than 30 feet, or 9 meters) that require compass accuracy to the
degree. Most electronic compasses have instructions on how to calibrate
them in their manuals (calibration usually involves driving the boat around in
fixed-length laps).
Reading a compass
As you may notice, the compass card (rotating piece on which the numbers
are written) is divided into increments. The four biggies are the cardinal
points: north (000°), south (180°), east (090°), and west (270°). Sometimes on
larger compasses, the four other points — NE (045°), SE (135°), SW (225°),
and NW (315°) — are also indicated by their initials. On a really large com-
pass, the smallest increments (indicated by a hash mark) can be a single
degree. Smaller compasses may have a hash mark for only every 5-degree
increment, which is why the bigger the compass, the better!
If you’re sitting directly behind a dome compass, you can determine your
boat’s heading by lining up the center lubber line — fixed vertical post(s)
around the edge of the compass card — with the markings on the compass
184
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

card. The lubber line indicating your course is the center one in the direction
of the bow. You can read your boat’s heading on a bulkhead compass in a simi-
lar fashion, but notice that the center lubber line is on the back side of the
compass. Keep in mind that regardless of the compass type, it needs to be
mounted “straight” for the lubber line to accurately reflect the boat’s heading.
Steering a compass course
When the navigator sets a course to sail, he announces it to the helmsman,
expecting him to follow that heading like a railroad track. Hey, dream on.
Holding a compass course is difficult, especially at night in really wavy condi-
tions. Getting accustomed to the natural movement of the compass card
takes a little while.
Sometimes, like when sailing close-hauled in shifty winds, holding a compass
course is just about impossible (refer to Chapter 5 for more on sailing close-
hauled). However, at other times (such as in thick fog), holding a steady
course is crucial. The following tips can help:
 Pick a spot on the horizon. Steering while looking down at the compass
is difficult. Try to pick a spot on the horizon that seems to line up with
the desired compass course, and then rotate your eyes down to the
compass only periodically to confirm your heading with the lubber line.
 Steer an average heading. In big waves, when the compass card is
swinging all around, try to bracket the desired heading by steering no
more than, say, 5 degrees on either side.
 Pay attention and be honest. In tricky conditions, pay attention to your
average heading and report it to the navigator in periodic increments
(say, 30 minutes — more often if the conditions and situation warrant).
Basic Navigation — Piloting
Now you’re in for the really fun part of navigation, using the skills of piloting.
Piloting involves frequent determination of position (or a line of position) 
relative to geographical points. As you discover in the section “Using GPS:
Electronic Navigation,” at the end of the chapter, an affordable electronic device
called a Global Positioning System (GPS) makes navigation so easy that many
people never see the need to figure out these “old-fashioned” skills of piloting.
Like any electronic device, however, a GPS can go on the blink, or the batter-
ies can run out. Even when a GPS is working well, the skills of piloting are
sometimes easier and more accurate. We strongly urge you to first master
185
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

how to navigate the old-fashioned way and then — and only then — turn to
the alluring GPS. With this in mind, take a look at the fine art of taking infor-
mation and then plotting it on a paper chart to find your position.
Using a speedometer and a depth sounder
We rely so much on a boat’s electronic speedometer and depth sounder that
we think of them as “traditional” instruments, but they deserve a little more
explanation.
A speedometer serves the same function on a boat as on a car — telling you
how fast you’re going. A tiny paddlewheel fitted under the belly of the hull
drives most boat speedometers. Note: A speedometer only tells you your
speed through the water, not speed over the ground, because it doesn’t
factor in current (see “Figuring in current and leeway,” later in this section).
Meanwhile, a depth sounder simply uses sonar waves to tell you how much
room is underneath the boat and displays this measurement on a dial or digi-
tal readout. You can then compare the depth indicated to the information on
a chart to help determine your location (and to avoid sailing into shallow
water).
Taking a bearing
Unless you’re right on top of a known point, such as a government buoy
(which is illegal, by the way), you have to determine your position by estab-
lishing a series of LOPs, or lines of position (lines through some point on
which you presume your boat is located as a result of an observation or mea-
surement). The most common measurement in piloting is taking a compass
bearing, as Figure 9-5 shows. To help you pinpoint your location, you must
take a bearing of an object of known position, such as a buoy or the peak of a
mountain, not a moving object or object that isn’t on your chart.
The procedure for taking a bearing changes a bit depending on the type of
compass you use. (For example, bulkhead compasses don’t lend themselves
to taking a bearing, because you can’t look through them.) However, the
basic principles remain the same; just follow these steps:
1. Pick out the object on which you intend to get a bearing.
For example, if you’re close to the shore, you might pick a mountain.
Make sure the object appears on your nautical chart! Buoys are okay,
but they can move slightly. Fixed objects (lighthouses and objects on
land) are the best.
186
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

2. Situate your eyes so that an imaginary line from the object to your
eyes passes through the center of the compass (which you’re close
enough to read).
3. Read the compass bearing on the far side of the compass that’s
crossed by that imaginary line.
Taking a bearing requires a good imagination — and sometimes several
readings. The key is to visualize the imaginary line from the object to the
compass.
4. With the compass course of the bearing now known, go to your chart
and find the object or point that you measured.
5. Take the parallel rulers and lay them on the compass rose so that the
outer long edge rests on the (magnetic) compass course of your bear-
ing and the center point of the compass rose.
6. Carefully “walk” the parallel rulers over to the observed point.
Use the same one-step-at-a-time technique we describe in “Charts: A
Sailor’s Roadmap,” earlier in this chapter.
7. Draw a line along the edge of the rulers going through the point.
Note this line of position with the time of day. Your actual position is (the-
oretically) somewhere on this line. You may draw this line shorter on the
chart if you have a fairly good idea of where you are (see Figure 9-6).
To get a highly accurate line of position, try this cool (albeit uncommon)
method. Whenever you visually line up two points that are on the chart, you
can plot them as a line of position. This type of observation is called a range.
Long Island Sound, where I grew up, has a great range that occurs when two
huge smokestacks line up on the Long Island shore. Because I sailed up and
down the Sound quite a bit, I drew a line on the chart for this range and
always watched for it.

Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Fixing your position
Where two lines of position taken at the same time cross, you can fix your
position on the chart, as Figure 9-6 shows. An accurate fix is every naviga-
tor’s goal, but error can creep in and degrade accuracy in many ways. To min-
imize error, remember these tips:
 Take bearings on objects at right angles to each other. You can get the
most accurate fix from two given LOPs when they’re at 90 degrees to
each other. When two LOPs cross at a shallow angle, even a small error
in one of the bearings can lead to a large error in the fix.
 Three is better than two. By taking bearings on three objects (ideally
about 60 degrees from each other), you further minimize the chance of
error. Of course, your fix probably ends up looking like a triangle rather
than a cross, but you can simply assume that you’re in the middle of
that triangle, as Figure 9-6 shows.
 Take bearings on nearby objects. The nearer the object, the less effect
an error in bearing has on your fix.
 Take two or three readings for each object. Multiple readings minimize
any error you may make in taking the bearing.
 Use ranges whenever possible. Ranges are really accurate.
 Cross-check your fix with the depth sounder (if you have one that you
know to be accurate). Don’t forget to account for the height of the tide
above (or below) mean low water. Comparing the depth measured with
the depth on the chart is akin to getting yet another fix.
 Write down the time of the fix adjacent to it to aid in dead reckoning
(covered in the very next section).
Figure 9-6:

tion fix is

188
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Don’t dally when taking bearings. This method of position fixing with multiple
lines of position assumes that the LOPs are all taking concurrently. If it takes
five minutes to get your second and third bearings, and your boat is moving
the whole time, then the fix’s accuracy will be degraded.
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning, or DR, is the process of determining position by advancing a
previous position for courses and distances. (It’s also one of Peter’s favorite
CDs by the Grateful Dead.) By definition, DR isn’t as accurate as fixing your
position with some accurate lines of position; however, many times you don’t
have an acceptable object (or only one of dubious value) on which to take a
bearing.
To be able to perform dead reckoning calculations, you must understand the
important relationship between speed, time, and distance. Speed (always
expressed on a boat in knots, or nautical miles per hour) is simply distance
(nautical miles) divided by time (hours). If you’re good at basic math, you’ll
have no problem remembering the following equations:
S = Speed (knots)
D = Distance (nautical miles)
T = Time (hours)
S = D ÷ T
D = S × T
T = D ÷ S
If you know two of the three quantities, you can determine the third. You use
this principle most commonly to calculate distance traveled. If you know
your average speed (from your speedometer) and the time you traveled, then
you can calculate the distance. Furthermore, if you know the average com-
pass course that you steered, you can advance your position on the chart
from your last known (or estimated) position.
For example, suppose that you fix your position on the chart with three bear-
ings taken at noon. You then steer an average heading of 090° at 6.8 knots for
25 minutes. You can calculate the distance traveled as follows:
D = S × T
D = 6.8 knots × (25⁄60)
D = 2.83 nautical miles
Therefore, you can establish your DR position at 1225 by measuring 2.83
miles along a course of 090°M from the noon fix, using the same techniques of
operating the parallel rulers and dividers we outline in “Charts: A Sailor’s
Roadmap,” earlier in this chapter. The updated location is your dead reck-
oned position, and you should mark it on the chart as such with an encircled
dot, the letters “DR,” and the time.
189
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Use the six-minute rule: When determining distance traveled, you must often
use a time interval of less than one hour, creating a cumbersome math prob-
lem. But because six minutes is one tenth of an hour, you can use this incre-
ment of time to ease your calculations. For example, a boat going 6.8 knots
travels 0.68 nautical miles (nm) in six minutes, or roughly 1.4 nm in 12 min-
utes, and so on.
Figuring in current and leeway
When advancing your position with DR, you may also need to consider two
types of movement not measured on the speedometer and compass. Leeway
is the sideslipping motion that occurs when a boat sails a close-hauled course.
The impact of leeway varies from boat to boat. Current has a similar “invisi-
ble” effect on the boat’s progress. For more on currents, see Chapter 8.
Keeping a log
Given the importance of staying on top of your speed (or distance traveled)
and heading, you can see why all serious navigators keep logs. A log is simply
a historical record of various pieces of information. You can design your log
to include whatever information you think is important. Common items of
entry include
 Average heading since the last entry: Whenever the boat changes
course (say, after a tack), make a new entry.
 Average speed since the last entry: Make your best guess.
 Given course: Course desired by the navigator.
 Log reading: Most instrument systems have a log, which is simply a 
distance-measuring device, a nautical odometer (as opposed to your
written log).
 Time: Normally recorded in the 24-hour format (6 a.m. is 0600).
 Weather information: Wind speed and direction, cloud cover, baromet-
ric pressure, and so on.
 Other comments: For example, what sails are up, who is driving, when
the boat tacked or jibed, what was for dinner, and so on.
When should you keep a log? Obviously, you don’t need one when you sail a
dinghy in familiar waters (nor do you have a place to store it) or when you go
on a short harbor cruise. If you’re crossing the ocean, definitely keep a log. In
between, use your judgment. Keep a log any time doing so can add to the
boat’s safety.

Grasping Special Piloting Techniques
The key to safe navigation is to make navigating as easy to perform as possi-
ble. We began this chapter with the “common sense” section, because you
sometimes (such as in your home waters) can perform the necessary tasks
without fiddling with parallel rulers and dividers.
However, rigorous dead reckoning and frequent fixing of your position have
their time and place. Navigating at night in a new location with many shoals
and hazards is an example. Much of the time, your task requires a level of
navigational effort somewhere in between the two extremes. This section
provides some helpful techniques.
Danger bearing
Often a narrow entrance channel to a harbor is marked by two navigational
aids (one on land and one farther away) that, when aligned, indicate a safe
course, sort of like landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier. Sometimes light-
houses display a different color light (red instead of white) in a sector of their
sweep. The edges (where those colors meet) are danger bearings: On one side
the boat is safe; on the other could be shallow water.
The navigator can also determine a danger bearing from information gained
from the nautical chart. For example, if your present course requires you to
sail around an island with rocky shoals on one side, you can plot a line of
position (LOP) as a danger bearing tangent to an obvious landmark or naviga-
tional aid of which you want the boat to stay outside, as shown in Figure 9-7.
By monitoring the bearing to this object and comparing it to your danger
bearing (measured in the normal manner on the chart), you can avoid the
hazard without having to constantly run down to the chart table and plot
your position.
Add some “padding” to the danger bearing. For example, if a bearing of 350
degrees to a buoy just skirts a shoal, add (or subtract, depending on which
side of the line is safe water) 5 degrees or so, especially as you get close to
the danger.
191
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Distance off
You can fix your position on a chart with two LOPs you obtain from bearings,
but you can also fix your position if you have one LOP and know your distance,
or range, away from that object. You simply find the point at which the LOP
crosses the circle of position marked by a circle whose radius is the distance you
are away from its center. You can obtain a circle of position in many ways. Two
of the most helpful are by judging distance and by doubling the relative angle.
Judging distance
Every top navigator likes to think that he or she has the ability to judge dis-
tance equal to a pro golfer (or her caddie). The skill comes from practice.
Any time you’re out on the water (or on the shore), you can practice by
making a game of judging distance. All you need is a nautical chart (and
knowledge of where you are) to be able to check your guesstimate.
I like guessing distance, and I do it all the time. I’ve stored away in my “mind’s
eye” a catalog of what certain distances look like. For example, I know that
the distance across Skaneateles Lake (New York) from our dock is 2 miles,
and I know what that distance looks like by heart. So when something is
about 2 miles away, I ask myself whether it’s closer or farther than the other
side of the lake. My brain has also stored away what 6 miles looks like from
all the time I’ve spent staring out of jet airplane windows. And of course, 100
yards is ingrained from my early years playing around on a football field. You
see, your brain already has a catalogue of what certain distances look like.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Here are some other pointers we’ve gleaned over the years:
 If you can discern individual trees, you’re less than a mile away.
 If you can make out house windows, you’re less than 2 miles away.
 If you can’t see the true edge of the land and water, you’re more than 3
miles away.
Doubling the relative angle
You can find plenty of tricky ways to judge distance by using the science and
magic of geometry. The easiest one to remember is “doubling the relative
angle,” but you have to be steering a straight course for it to work. When you
pass an object of interest (say, a lighthouse), note the time when it’s 45 degrees
(relative angle) off your bow. Pay attention to the average speed, and when
the lighthouse is dead abeam (90 degrees to the bow), you’ve “doubled the
angle,” so note the time again. Through the wonders of geometry, the dis-
tance you travel between the two readings equals your distance away from
the object at the time of the second reading. Now you can plot a circle of
position, take a bearing on that object, and you have a fix.
Navigating in the Fog
By definition, you can’t see anything in fog, so the skills of dead reckoning
can become crucially important to avoid getting lost or worse. Here are some
good rules to keep in mind when fog descends:
 Be aware of the potential for fog. See Chapter 8 where we discuss how
and when fog forms.
 If fog starts to roll in, react. It won’t totally blanket you without some
warning, so quickly figure out your compass heading back to the harbor.
 Assuming you have a chart, immediately fix your position as accu-
rately as possible. If you don’t have a chart or are simply day sailing,
immediately set your course for a safe haven (like home).
 Follow the procedures for keeping an accurate dead reckoning. If you
have a depth sounder, use it, especially if you’re passing areas with
steep transitions in depth that can help accurately provide a fix of posi-
tion by referring to the depths indicated on your chart.
 Listen for buoys and foghorns. The nautical chart (and good ol’ Chart
No. 1) indicates what navigational aids make certain sounds.
 Listen for other boats. Every boat is required to post a “lookout.” Keep
in mind that sound does weird things in fog, so pinpointing the location
of a sound can be difficult.
193
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

 Make sound signals. The rules of the road require a sailboat (39 feet, or
12 meters, or longer) to make one long horn blast followed by two short
blasts every two minutes or less. For the other rules of the road, see
Chapter 4.
Remember when we advised you to master the traditional skills of navigation
before using a GPS unit? Well, fog is a good time to disobey us!
Navigating at Night
When night falls, you lose some, but not all, of the visual information impor-
tant to a navigator. Even in familiar waters, the arrival of night is a good time
to break out the nautical chart and increase the level of your navigational
efforts. One of the most important aspects of coastal navigation at night is
your ability to identify lighted buoys, lighthouses, and other boats.
Lighting up the nighttime sky
At night, certain buoys, daymarks, and other navigational aids such as light-
houses display lights to help the mariner find his way. To prevent confusion,
navigational aids are lit in a variety of ways, utilizing color, pattern, and
period (the time interval between flashes) to help identification at night.
Typically, the solid red and green buoys, so important in defining a channel,
are lit with corresponding red and green lights. Lighthouses and midchannel
fairway buoys often feature a white light. On a nautical chart, abbreviations
such as “F” for “fixed, unblinking,” and “FL Xsec” for “flashing at X-second
intervals” indicate the characteristics of each light.
Chart No. 1 can help you decipher the abbreviations defining the characteris-
tics of the light. You usually need to view two or three cycles of the light
sequence to be sure that you’ve positively identified it. Realize also that the
lights on buoys have a much shorter range (about 2 miles, or 3 kilometers;
even less in big waves) than lighthouses. You may have an easier time identi-
fying a buoy or lighthouse if you first calculate (on the chart) its expected
bearing and then look in that direction.
Recognizing other boats at night
All boats are required to have navigation lights (also called running lights) at
night (including dusk and dawn) and whenever visibility is reduced (such as
in fog, heavy rain, or haze). Power boats, larger commercial ships, and other
seagoing craft all have required lighting configurations that vary consider-
ably depending on the type of boat (or barge or submarine). But most vessels
194
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

have red and green lights to identify port and starboard and have some kind
of white stern light while underway. Larger ships often use really bright fore-
and-aft range lights that help you determine which way it is heading. See
Figure 9-8 for the running lights on a typical sailboat and on a larger ship
(more than 164 feet, or 50 meters). You definitely want to get out of the way if
you can see both the red and green bow lights of any vessel coming at you.
At night, keeping interior (and deck) lights to a minimum helps the night
vision of those on deck (especially the navigator, who may be going back and
forth between the chart table below and the cockpit). Many boats have lights
with red bulbs for night operation, because red light doesn’t affect night
vision like white lights do. Keep in mind that red lines and symbols on the
chart look faint and gray in red light.
Using GPS: Electronic Navigation
Understanding and being proficient at the “traditional” skills of piloting and
dead reckoning on a paper chart are absolutely crucial before trusting your boat
(and your safety) to a machine. But after you master those traditional skills,
using a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit makes the navigator’s job a breeze.
The GPS unit is a satellite navigation device that uses information from a
bevy of U.S. Department of Defense satellites to give you your current lati-
tude and longitude. Like your TV set, you don’t need to know how it works to
use it. GPS units have revolutionized the art of navigation.

Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

Many different GPS models are available, so read the instruction manual for
specific instructions on how to turn on and properly configure your GPS.
When you configure your device, set the GPS to display magnetic degrees
(not true degrees); nautical miles and knots (not kilometers or statute miles);
your local time (not Greenwich Mean Time); latitude and longitude units in
degrees, minutes, and decimal minutes; and to use the WGS 84 datum (the
standard datum, or theoretical global shape — remember that the earth isn’t
round) used for most nautical charts in the United States. These conventions
make navigating by using your own watch and nautical charts easier, because
then all the parts are in synch. 
The features of different marine GPS units vary, but here are a few common
tasks that are helpful to the navigator that virtually all marine GPS units 
perform:
 Create a waypoint (the latitude/longitude coordinates of any point you
desire) or even a route made up of many waypoints, and then a GPS
helps you follow that route by displaying helpful information like course
to steer, range to the waypoint, estimated time of arrival, and cross-track
error (how far you’ve drifted off the rhumb line, or straight-line, course).
 Save a man-overboard position (usually with the push of one button)
and immediately switch the GPS into a mode where it helps you navigate
back to that position.
 Give you very accurate SOG (speed over ground) and COG (course
over ground) reports, which can help in your navigation or even cali-
bration of your compass and speedometer (if there isn’t much current).
We like to set the damping of the SOG and COG variables quite low so
they update quickly.
 Keep a digital log so you can determine how far you’ve gone over a 
certain period, which can be helpful in navigation or just for knowing
whether you just set the world sailing speed record for a 24-hour run.
You need to sail more than 700 miles in a 24-hour period at an average
speed of more than 30 knots to be close.
But having a GPS doesn’t mean you can throw away those paper charts. One
thing you need to know is how to plot the position (latitude and longitude)
given by your GPS onto a chart as a fix. Here’s the most accurate way:
1. Write down the indicated latitude and longitude from the GPS and
find them on the appropriate scales bounding your chart.
Make a small tick mark with a pencil at each of those points.
2. Line up the outer edge of the parallel ruler with a nearby latitude or
longitude line.
Those lines are either at the edge of the chart or somewhere in the
middle, marked by a thin black line running horizontally (latitude) or
vertically (longitude) across the chart.
196
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

3. “Walk” the parallel ruler to the tick mark for that value (either longi-
tude or latitude) and draw an LOP.
We cover this walking technique earlier in “Measuring a course and range.”
4. Do the same for the other value (either longitude or latitude).
Where the two LOPs cross was your location at the time you wrote the
coordinates! Refer to Figure 9-6 for how to mark this fix on the chart.
Chart plotting with GPS
We don’t need to tell you how fast technology changes the way people do so
many everyday things. The art and science of navigation isn’t immune to this
whirlwind either. For example, the GPS system that seems so ubiquitous now
wasn’t even available to the general public when Peter won his first
America’s Cup (in 1987).
We recommend knowing the basic skills of navigation and piloting before relying
completely on a gadget comprised of lasers and silica chips that runs on a bat-
tery. That said, we love digital navigation technology and the additional informa-
tion and ease of use that it provides. Although being able to use a computer (or
fancy GPS) for navigation offers plenty of benefits, by far and away the most
valuable one is chart plotting — being able to plot or display your exact posi-
tion on a digital chart. With that accurate position plotted on a good chart, you
can much more accurately plan your course and avoid dangers — all without
taking the time to take bearings and transpose them to a paper chart.
No matter how many GPSs you have on board, never head into unfamiliar
waters without the basic tools required for coastal piloting (especially a
paper chart) and never ever make a major offshore passage (like crossing an
ocean) without having a sextant, instruction book, and either the requisite
books (tables and almanacs) or a calculator or PC with all that information
stored inside.
You have basically two options for chart plotting technology:
 GPS display: Some GPS have a built-in chart-plotting feature. The resolu-
tion and accuracy of the chart displayed by the GPS varies greatly
depending on the technology of the unit. So does the ease of operation
of the unit for simple tasks like calculating a range and bearing to a way-
point. Your local marine store has a variety of chart-plotting GPS units
that use a variety of technologies.
If you need the accuracy and ease of chart-plotting technology, but your
boat is so small that you don’t have a good (and dry) place to work on
the computer down below, then you may consider a handheld chart-
plotting GPS.
197
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

 Computer display: We generally prefer using a laptop computer to run
the chart-plotting software, because the computer already has the com-
putational horsepower to handle the graphics end of things quite easily.
Then all you need is to connect your GPS (assuming it has data-out capa-
bility) to your computer. We find a computer has a bigger screen, is
much easier to operate, and runs much more powerful and versatile
software than a GPS. If you go this route, you need to purchase some
navigation software (check out your marine store), connect it to the GPS
and the sailing instruments, and find a good place to work on the com-
puter where it will stay dry and secure. If your boat is very wet down
below, consider a ruggedized (waterproof) laptop.
To keep your computer from sliding around every time the boat tacks,
get some sticky-backed Velcro and attach some strips on the bottom of
your laptop and on the chart table where you want to work.
When I’m the navigator, I love using a computer interfaced with the instru-
ments, because it helps me make better decisions and do a better job. Over
the past few years, I’ve enjoyed working on the development of special sail-
boat-racing software (www.iexpedition.org), as Figure 9-9 shows, that
combines the features of basic chart plotting and navigation with weather
analysis and routing and performance optimization. As all this technology
continues to evolve so fast, being on the cutting edge is fun.

How accurate is GPS?
You may wonder how accurate GPS is. A basic GPS receiver should be accurate
to less than 328 feet (100 meters). As long as the U.S. government cooperates,
a GPS fix is currently accurate to 49 feet (15 meters). You see, somebody
pushing a button at the Pentagon can degrade, improve the accuracy of, or
even turn off the signals sent down by the satellites. But assuming no military
reason exists to mess with the information coming to the public, then the
GPS accuracy can be enhanced (as long as you have the compatible hard-
ware) in the following ways:
 Differential: Mostly around the U.S. coast, more than 60 U.S. Coast Guard–
serviced radio stations send a “correction” signal to compatible GPS
receivers, which enhance their accuracy. Only differential-capable GPS
units within range (100 miles, or 161 kilometers, or so) of the differential
radio beacon can benefit from this enhancement, which brings GPS
accuracy into the 33-feet (10-meter)10-meter range.
 WAAS (or Wide Area Augmentation System): Overseen by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, this is an even more
accurate system, which provides corrections to the GPS signal. But
unlike differential technology, the WAAS enhancement is delivered by
satellite to the WAAS-enabled GPS units. Accuracy improvements to
position fixing surpass even the differential technology. Although pri-
marily aimed to benefit the aviation community (how would you like to
land a 777 by computer?), sailors like knowing where they are too!
If you really love all this stuff, then head to the Internet to get the latest infor-
mation on this evolving technology. Check out the Web sites of GPS manufac-
turers or surf to www.navcen.uscg.gov/dgps/Default.htm for the
USCG’s info and http://gps.faa.gov for the latest from the FAA.
Wishing on a Star: Celestial Navigation
From high-tech to really traditional, celestial navigation (navigating by celes-
tial bodies like stars, the moon, and the sun) is the coolest form of naviga-
tion. Using this system puts you in a league with the greats, like Galileo,
Copernicus, Magellan, Columbus, and Cook. Well, maybe that’s a bit of a
stretch, but the fact that you can determine where you are in the world (to an
accuracy of less than a mile) with a sextant (device that accurately measures
the angular height of a celestial body over the horizon), a watch, and some
books of tables is pretty amazing. Oh, yes, you need one other thing — a
clear or partially clear sky during daylight, dawn, or dusk hours. Nighttime
and clouds put a real damper on celestial navigation, because you need to
see the celestial object and the horizon.
199
Chapter 9: Navigation: Holding Your Course

A general book like this one is too small to do justice to celestial navigation.
Fortunately, you can find many good books on the subject. Peter’s favorite is
Kindergarten of Celestial Navigation, by Joseph Sellar.
The basic principal of celestial navigation is easy to grasp. If you can measure
the angle between the horizon and a celestial body of known position at a
certain time (thank you, Copernicus and friends), you can generate a circle of
position. You are somewhere in that circle of position. Get another reading
from a different celestial body or the same one at a different time, and if you
haven’t moved, the two circles of position cross at your location (and also at
a point on the other side of the planet, where you obviously aren’t). See an
example of celestial navigation geometry in Figure 9-10.

A
lthough nowadays many quiet little coves that used to be perfect for a
peaceful night at anchor are filled with mooring buoys and marinas,
knowing how to anchor is important for those times when you run out of
wind or want to try to find a special spot that’s all your own. Before reading
this chapter, you may want to refer to Chapter 6, which covers the basics of
tying up (securing your boat) to a dock and mooring (a permanently
anchored buoy).
Anchoring your boat is more involved than tying it to a mooring because
you’re responsible for lowering the anchor and making sure that it’s secure.
This chapter focuses on everything related to anchors, from dropping and
retrieving your anchor to choosing the best anchor and gear.

Looking at a Basic Anchor
How do you keep a floating object anchored? One way is to find a really
heavy rock, tie a strong rope to it, and throw it overboard. But what happens
when you want to leave that spot and go someplace else? Hauling that enor-
mous rock on board may be impossible. You can just cut the rope attached to
the rock, but then what would you do if you want to anchor the next night
(plus you’d be littering)?
Another problem with the rock method is wind or current. A strong wind
pushes very hard on your boat, which, in turn, pulls very hard on your rock —
so hard that it may simply slide or roll across the bottom. Fortunately, you
have a better way — thanks to the invention of properly designed anchors.
Most anchors share the following characteristics, as Figure 10-1 shows:
 They sink! (An anchor wouldn’t work very well if it floated, would it?)
 They have holding power, thanks to one or more prongs or points
called flukes. These flukes act like the blade of a shovel to dig into the
bottom. Because the flukes help grip the bottom, the anchor can weigh
less, making it easier to bring on board.
 They have a long arm, or shank, providing mechanical advantage to
help the flukes dig in.
 They have some sort of feature to help keep the flukes dug in when the
wind or current shifts and the boat pulls from a different direction.
 Despite their holding power, they can be “unstuck” relatively easily.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

If the wind and/or your engine die, knowing how to anchor is an important
safety skill. The anchor is typically stored down below deck, usually just for-
ward or next to the mast, but on some bigger cruising keelboats, it may
already be rigged and ready to go up on the bow. When stored below deck,
the anchor line should be nicely flaked (neatly folded), with the anchor and
chain on top. Ground tackle is the term for the entire package — the anchor
plus the anchor rode (the line and chain that attach the anchor to the boat).
Adding chain: Why it helps
Attaching several feet of chain to the anchor ensures that the pulling force on
the anchor comes from the all-important horizontal direction, parallel to the
bottom, so the flukes stay dug into the bottom (check out Figure 10-1). In
addition, chain doesn’t chafe if dragged over sharp rocks on the bottom. In
extreme anchoring conditions (strong winds or a long stay) or for a really big,
heavy sailboat, the entire anchor rode needs to be chain.
The scoop on scope
In the cartoons, Popeye simply drops the anchor and rope over the side until
it hits bottom and then cleats it off. In the real world, you need to let out
much more rope than the depth of the water.
Scope (the ratio between the length of anchor rode you let out and the water’s
depth) is an important concept to understand when anchoring. Too little scope,
such as Popeye’s 1:1 scope, is impractical and dangerous — the pull on the
anchor is vertical, and your boat dislodges the anchor at high tide or on the top
of any wave. Increasing the ratio of scope allows the anchor to be pulled in a
more horizontal direction, which greatly increases its holding power.
The basic rule is to use 5:1 scope (five times as much anchor rode as the dis-
tance to the bottom at high tide) for average conditions. For example, if your
anchorage is 20 feet deep at high tide, then you let out 100 feet of anchor
rode before cleating it (roughly 10 feet of chain and 90 feet of nylon anchor
line for a 30-foot sailboat).
The more scope (that is, the more rope you let out), the better the holding
power of your anchor, as Figure 10-2 shows. When in doubt . . . let out more
rope for more scope. Some anchor manufacturers recommend 7:1 scope. As
long as you have plenty of room for the boat to swing if the wind or current
shifts direction, you rest easier knowing your boat is better secured.
203
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

If the conditions are very mild and you plan on stopping for only a short
break and staying on board, you can probably get away with laying out less
scope (not less than 3:1) or using a lighter anchor with less chain. Less scope
means less work hauling in that soggy wet rope when you want to get under
way. Check out the section called “Choosing the right anchor line,” later in
this chapter, for tips on marking your anchor-line length.
Picking a Good Place to Anchor
To know where to anchor, you need to familiarize yourself with a chart of the
area. From the chart, you can determine the water depth and the type of
bottom to find a suitable anchorage. You also need to know how much (if at
all) the tide will rise and fall. (See Chapter 9 for more on charts and tides.) On
a trip, you can buy a local “cruising guide,” which points out special consid-
erations about various anchoring spots.
For comfort, you want to find an anchorage protected from the prevailing
wind and wave direction. For safety, you need to find an anchorage that fea-
tures the following:
 A suitable bottom for securing your anchor
 Enough depth to avoid the danger of grounding but not so much depth
that with a 5:1 or more scope, retrieving the anchor is a back-breaker
 Sufficient room for your boat to swing in all directions (imagine the
anchor is the center of a circle around which the boat swings)

The greater scope in “A” keeps the angle of pull more 
horizontal, helping dig the anchor’s flukes into the bottom.

Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

 A quiet location out of any channel
 A location protected from waves and strong winds
Spending enough time choosing the best anchorage before you drop anchor
is much easier than having to pull up your anchor and move.
Finding the lee
Very few anchorages are protected in all wind directions, so your first step is
to note the current wind direction and review the marine weather forecast.
(See Chapter 8 for more information about weather and marine forecasts.) A
good, protected anchorage is in the lee of the wind — that is, the adjacent
land blocks the force of the wind and waves. If the forecast is for strong, east-
erly breezes, for example, you want to anchor just to the west of the protect-
ing landmass.
Alongside a lee shore (shore facing the oncoming wind and waves) is the
most dangerous place for an anchored boat. If the anchor slips at all, you can
find yourself getting washed up onto the beach or worse. Anchoring along a
lee shore is like standing in the middle of the road — you may be safe for a
while, but your odds aren’t so good. The tricky part about picking a good
place to anchor is that with a 180-degree wind shift, your nice, protected
anchorage can become the dreaded lee shore.
Avoiding underwater hazards
You can never go wrong by dropping the hook in some medium-soft mud.
Avoid a rocky bottom, because the flukes of the anchor can’t dig in. A chart,
as shown in Figure 10-3, indicates bottom type and shows you underwater
hazards to avoid such as rocks, cables, and shipwrecks. Nothing is worse
than getting your anchor so stuck on an object that you have to go swimming
or cut your anchor line away.
Fortunately, the world is becoming more ecologically aware. For example, in
the Virgin Islands (where you can enjoy some of the nicest cruising in the
world, as we point out in Chapter 17), the local authorities now place moor-
ing buoys at popular anchorages. Because tying up to a mooring is infinitely
easier than anchoring, life is now much easier for those of us above the
water’s surface. But the reason for the moorings is to protect the creatures
underwater. Dropping an anchor onto a coral reef is a big environmental no-
no and causes irreparable damage to this priceless feature of the tropical
oceans. Don’t do it. If you must anchor near coral reefs, find a sandy spot or
even put on your mask and snorkel to help find the best spot before crash
landing your anchor.
205
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

Keeping an eye on depth and current
Because charts indicate the water depth at mean low water (average low
tide), seeing spots that are deep enough for your boat is easy. In big waves or
a swell, allow a few more feet of clearance for when the boat is down in the
trough. Better yet, avoid anchoring in waves; the idea of anchoring is to relax
and get a break from the open-water conditions. Use the chart and/or tide
books to ascertain the local currents. Avoid anchoring in places with strong
current. For more on currents, see Chapter 9.
Staying away from crowds
Avoid crowded anchorages, where you’re restricted in the amount of scope
you can let out. In a squall, one of these neighboring boats may drag its
anchor — possibly into your boat! A boat at anchor swings with the wind and
current, so make sure your boat is free to swing in a circle around the anchor
(see Figure 10-4).
If you must choose a spot in a crowded anchorage, check out your potential
new neighbors. A large powerboat may run a noisy generator all night. Netting
on the lifelines and Mickey Mouse swim floats signify the delights of small chil-
dren on board. So that you aren’t the chief noisemaker, remember that in strong
winds, halyards can beat a very loud tune, so tie them off away from the mast.

Getting Ready to Anchor
After you study the harbor carefully and find the perfect spot to anchor, you
want to put that anchor in securely on your first try. Anchoring can be stress-
ful, and knowing that the folks on nearby anchored boats are watching your
every move doesn’t help.
The key to anchoring is waiting to drop the anchor until the boat is stopped
dead in the water and just beginning to drift backward — similar to picking
up a mooring (refer to Chapter 6). Keep in mind that the easiest way to go
backward on a sailboat is under power. Anchoring under power also has the
advantage of letting you clear the foredeck (area on deck in front of the mast)
of sails before you get started so the crew has space to prepare the anchor
and rode without stepping on or dirtying the sails. (Because sometimes you
must anchor without using an engine, we have an “Anchoring under Sail” sec-
tion later in this chapter.)
The most common anchoring mishaps are caused by not preparing the
anchor rode to run out smoothly. Murphy’s Law is definitely in force during
anchoring. The knots and tangles that a long piece of rope can get into are
amazing. We hope you check that the anchor line is neatly flaked before you
leave the dock, but checking it again after it’s on deck while the skipper is
finding the ideal anchorage is still a good idea.
When the skipper selects a spot, make sure that the crew dropping the
anchor knows the depth so that they can prepare enough anchor rode.
Take the time to lay out (flake) enough line so that it can run out smoothly
until the anchor can touch the bottom, and neatly coil the remainder (with
the part closest to the anchor on top) so that it’s ready to run. If your boat
has a chain locker (compartment in the bow that holds the anchor rode

“pre-flaked”), you need to pull out and arrange only enough line for the
anchor to hit bottom. As long as the rope in the chain locker was stored cor-
rectly, the rest of the rope in the locker pays out cleanly as the boat is backed
away from the anchor to add the necessary scope.
Make sure that you lead the anchor line over an anchor roller or through a
fairlead (also called a bow chock) and under the bow pulpit (the metal frame
surrounding the bow to which the forward ends of the lifelines attach), as
Figure 10-5 shows. Always tie the end of the anchor line to a secure point on
the boat, such as a deck cleat or the mast, before dropping anchor. The
ocean floor is littered with anchors from boats where the deck crew let out
“just a little more line” before tying it off.
Before anchoring, make a final inspection of the anchor line for chafe, check
that any shackles are tight, and make sure that the bitter end of the anchor
rode is tied securely to the boat (if not, you’re in for an expensive “oops”).
Follow these steps when you’re preparing to drop the anchor:
1. Approach the spot from several boat lengths to leeward and then turn
the boat head-to-wind.
2. Slow the boat down and stop right over the desired spot for your anchor.
This spot isn’t where the boat sits; it’s where the anchor sits. The boat
lies downwind (or down current) of this spot. As the wind or current
shifts, your boat needs to swing around this spot (hopefully without dis-
lodging the anchor) in a 360-degree circle.

3. Give the signal.
The key to anchoring is waiting to drop the anchor until the boat starts
to go backward. Because the best judge of boat speed is the skipper, the
crew members on the bow wait to drop the anchor until they see a hand
signal (pointing down quickly works) or hear a hail such as, “Drop the
hook, mateys.” Hook is sailor slang for anchor.
Hails can be difficult to hear in a strong wind.
4. Drop the anchor.
See the next section.
Dropping the Anchor
The safest way to lower the anchor and the chain over the side is to slowly
lower it hand over hand or under the control of an anchor windlass (if your
boat is so equipped). A windlass looks like a winch drum mounted near the
bow in line with a bow-mounted anchor roller that allows the anchor rode to
smoothly drop over the rail of the boat. Figure 10-5 shows an electric wind-
lass that lowers or raises the anchor with a push of a button. A manual wind-
lass gives your muscle power some mechanical advantage, but most only
help with raising the anchor.
If you don’t have a windlass and are letting the anchor down by hand, try not
to let it or the chain touch the hull. As soon as the anchor and chain are
safely in the water, you can let the anchor line slide out through the bow
chock (a pair of gloves can come in handy here).
Keep your body (especially your feet and fingers) away from and out of the
loops of anchor line or chain as it pays out.
You can tell when the anchor touches bottom — either the rope stops paying
out so fast, or you feel the weight of the anchor disappear as it settles in. The
foredeck crew’s job isn’t over when the anchor hits pay dirt; you need to let
out sufficient scope or extra rope (see the section “The scoop on scope,” ear-
lier in this chapter). When enough line to achieve the desired scope goes out,
the foredeck crew cleats off the anchor line and gives the signal to the helms-
man that you’re ready to set (dig in) the anchor.
Digging In for Awhile
You can ensure that your anchor is set and holding in a couple of ways:
209
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

 By touching the anchor rode with your hand, you can sometimes feel
the anchor bounce over the bottom, similar to taking someone’s pulse.
When the anchor digs in, the bouncing stops, but you can feel the line
stretching as the boat surges in waves.
 With the boat in reverse, you may be able to see the bow dip when
the flukes of the anchor take a grip on the bottom.
If you feel jerking motions, the anchor is dragging along the bottom. If your
anchor keeps dragging, you can try any of the following techniques to get the
anchor to set:
 Let out more scope. The anchor is probably skipping along the bottom,
and with more scope, the anchor can dig in.
 Give the anchor line a quick tug. This tip works best on a smaller boat.
 Speed up the engine in reverse. Try this on a bigger boat.
If you keep dragging, you may have to pick up your anchor and try again.
When your senses tell you that the anchor is holding, try to confirm it by
watching landmarks or a range. By sighting through two objects, you can
establish a line sight and watch your position to ensure that you’re not drag-
ging, as Figure 10-6 shows.
To be doubly sure that your anchor keeps on holding, try the following:
 Make sure you have enough scope. Consider the expected conditions,
your type of anchor and rode, and the anticipated length of stay.
 If a convenient range isn’t available, take a few compass bearings on
some distinctive landmarks. You can also use buoys (especially in the
Tree
Buoy

buoy to a

ensure your

210
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

direction perpendicular to your anchor line) for reference. For more
information about taking bearings, see Chapter 9.
 Share the range with your crew. Then they can double-check that
you’re securely anchored.
 Write down these safety bearings so that when your insomnia kicks in
at 2 a.m., you can reassure yourself that your boat is okay. Remember
that your range and bearings change if the boat swings with wind or cur-
rent shifts.
 Listen to your GPS system. Your electronic navigation system may have
an “anchor watch” alarm that rings if the boat moves out of a set area.
See the “Tackling Anchoring Problems” section, later in this chapter, for
more tips on using your GPS while at anchor.
 If you’re still concerned, dive down with a mask and inspect the
anchor, chain, and rope. Of course, this advice is easiest to follow if
you’re anchoring in the tropics.
 Follow Coast Guard regulations. The Coast Guard requires anchored
boats to display a black ball up in the mast during daytime and a 360-
degree fixed (not flashing) white light at night.
Retrieving Your Anchor
The key to picking up the anchor is teamwork between the crew and skipper.
After assigning positions, including the key role of the foredeck crew, follow
these steps:
1. Slowly motor directly toward the anchor.
The helmsman probably needs the crew (who is performing Step 2) to
occasionally point left or right to help keep on track.
2. As the boat is moving toward the anchor, the crew pulls the slack out
of the anchor line.
Moving up on the anchor creates slack in the line. This task shouldn’t be
physically difficult, because you’re simply pulling in limp line.
3. When the boat is directly over the anchor, the crew signals for the
helmsman to stop.
We use a closed fist hand signal.
4. Shift into neutral while the crew securely cleats the anchor line after
pulling out all the slack so the anchor line is vertical.
5. When the line is cleated, the crew signals that the helmsman can start
slowly going forward again until the anchor comes free.
211
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

Because the anchor line is pulling up and forward (the opposite direc-
tion it was dug in) on the anchor, the flukes usually lift out of the muddy
bottom easily.
Don’t blow out your back — let the boat’s engine do the tough work of
getting the anchor free of the bottom.
You can tell when the anchor is free because the bow bounces up
slightly and the anchor line has less pressure on it.
6. When the anchor is free, put the engine back into neutral and begin
the hardest part of the exercise — raising the anchor to the deck.
If you’re lucky enough to have an electric windlass, you may not even
break a sweat. A manual windlass gives you the mechanical advantage of
a winch, but you still need muscle power to crank it; otherwise, get
ready to pull and pull and pull some more.
If your boat has an anchor windlass, make sure you understand exactly
how it works before using it. Keep your hands clear of the moving parts
and treat its operation as you do any powerful power tool — slowly and
carefully.
Regardless of the equipment on board, let the engine do all the work
until the anchor breaks free from the ground. Take extra care to keep
from dragging the chain (and anchor) along the hull.
7. Before you bring your trusty anchor back on board, take a look at it
as it clears the water and clean it if necessary.
Chances are that the anchor has some remnants of its temporary home
still attached to it. Mud or sand may come off with repeated dunkings. If
not, grab the old standbys — a bucket and a brush — to clean the sticky
stuff off the anchor and chain before storing them.
8. Put the anchor away.
If your anchor gets stored on a bow roller, make sure that it’s safely
lashed in place before setting sail. If your anchor, chain, and line get
stored in a compartment on the bow, make sure the anchor line is neatly
flaked back and forth in long sections so it stays untangled. If storing
down below, see Chapter 4 for how to coil a rope.
Anchoring under Sail
Anchoring under power is much easier than anchoring under sail — the sails
are out of the way, the boat is easier to control, and the entire crew can con-
centrate on the task at hand. But if you don’t have an engine, anchoring
under sail is certainly possible and may be necessary if the wind dies.
212
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

We recommend dropping, folding, and stowing the jib (or furling if your boat
has a roller furler) before approaching the drop spot so that the anchor team
has room to do its work.
The key to anchoring under sail is boat control — slowing the boat to a stop
at your desired anchor drop spot and then backing the mainsail (pushing the
boom out so that the main fills backwards) to go in reverse until enough
scope is out to get the anchor to set. When you first back the main, put the
tiller or wheel in the center. After you start sailing backward, you can swing
the stern to the left (to port) by turning the helm to the right (to starboard),
and vice versa. Be careful not to oversteer — a little rudder movement goes a
long way. Practice going backward out in the open with no anchor involved
until you get it right. After you master sailing backward, the steps to drop-
ping the anchor are the same as in the preceding section.
All boats are less maneuverable at low speeds — and sailboats can be tricky
to get going again. So the toughest part of anchoring under sail is that, for a
moment, you intentionally stop the boat, and you lose steerageway until you
pick up speed in reverse. This loss of maneuverability is why we recommend
practicing first in open water. Leave your mainsail up (and luffing) until
you’re sure that you’re safely anchored so that you can easily escape under
sail if you have any problems.
If you do lose steerageway and are stopped, pointing straight into the wind,
you’re simply in irons. As in the case of anchoring under power, you want to
drop the anchor and begin going backward to add scope. But if you aren’t yet
to your desired anchoring spot — you need to get out of irons and get
moving forward again. Put the tiller or wheel to one side until the boat is
pointed on a reaching angle, and then you can trim your sail and get going
again. (See Chapter 5 for more information.)
Tackling Anchoring Problems
As the preceding sections illustrate, you need to consider many factors before
anchoring. Whether you plan to leave your anchored boat for a picnic on the
beach, go for a quick snorkeling trip, or you just want some peace of mind so
you can fall asleep down below while at anchor, here’s our “what-if” section. We
take the most common anchoring problems and provide you with solutions.
 You start swinging too close to another boat. Some boats “sail” around
quite a bit under anchor, powered by the force of the wind on the mast
and hull. You can’t do much to prevent this movement. But if you’re
swinging too close to another boat, either due to “sailing” or a shift in the
wind, one or both of you has to pick up anchor and move farther away or
213
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

put out a stern anchor to keep the boat from swinging (for more on set-
ting a second anchor, see “Looking At Advanced Techniques,” later in this
chapter). Etiquette says the boat that anchored last has to move, but if
no one is aboard the other boat, then you just pulled the short straw.
 You think your anchor starts dragging several hours after you
anchored. Keep in mind that your boat swings around the anchor (in a
circular arc) depending on changes in the direction of the wind and 
current. The compass bearings that you took to double-check that you
were securely anchored won’t be valid if your boat swings 180 degrees
because the current switches direction. If everyone in the anchorage
seems to be in the same positions relative to one another, but they’re all
pointing in different directions, you’ve probably swung. Before going to
sleep, make sure that you have a strong mental picture of the anchorage
and your boat’s position — you can even mark your position on the
chart, or your GPS may have an “anchor watch” feature.
If I have a GPS with a chart plotter or a computer with a charting program
attached to the instruments, I zoom in the chart to the maximum resolu-
tion after anchoring. By watching the trace of the boat’s track over time
(you may have to enable this feature on your GPS or computer), you can
often see if you’re dragging or simply moving in an arc around your anchor.
 The weather starts getting nasty. The added load from increased wind,
waves, and current in a storm may cause the anchor to start dragging. If
you know that more wind is coming, consider seeking better shelter. If
you decide to stay, let out plenty of additional scope (in rough condi-
tions, you may need as much as 10:1 scope). In rough weather, pull in or
let out several feet of anchor rode every few hours to minimize chafe on
the line where it goes through the bow chock or roller. If you have a
second anchor, you may want to set it (see the section “Doubling up:
Two anchors,” later in this chapter).
 You can’t pull up your anchor. First, make sure that you start directly
over the anchor with all the slack pulled out and the anchor line securely
cleated. If the wind shifts and your boat swings during your stay, you may
not be motoring in the right direction to get the flukes to pull out. Try
other directions, slowly increasing the engine power to apply more force.
If you’re having a problem getting the anchor on deck after you get it 
off the bottom, (and your boat isn’t equipped with an anchor windlass
on the foredeck), you may need to take the anchor line to a winch and
grind the line up. Make sure that the anchor line has a good lead through
the bow chock and back to the winch, without chafing on anything, and
stop grinding before the chain starts rubbing on the side of the hull.
Pulling up an anchor can take heaps of strength, so make sure that
you’re using the strongest people on the boat for the job.
214
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Choosing the Right Anchor
Most keelboats come equipped with the anchor package (but you may have
to search a lot of compartments to find it). In case you need to buy an anchor,
chain, or line, this section helps you shop like a pro. Various anchors perform
differently, depending on such factors as the type of bottom (sand, mud, grass,
or rock). The following are the two most common anchors on sailboats:
 The Danforth anchor (refer to Figure 10-1) takes its name from the com-
pany that invented it. It’s also called the lightweight anchor; because the
large flukes bury so well, the anchor can be lighter than a plow anchor.
The Danforth needs a soft sand or mud bottom (two of the most desir-
able bottom types for anchoring due to their holding potential) to grip
properly. This anchor is especially popular on dinghies and small keel-
boats because of its light weight and low profile on board. This anchor
isn’t perfect, however; the sharp points on its flukes can be troublesome
in storage. Some larger keelboats (longer than 30 feet, or 9 meters) may
carry an undersized Danforth as a “lunch hook” for easy temporary
anchoring in calm conditions as well as a heavier, primary anchor such
as a plow.
 The plow anchor looks like the farm implement — hence the name. It’s
also called by the trade name “CQR.” The plow is secure on most bot-
toms and is arguably the best all-around anchor for larger sailboats
(longer than 30 feet, or 9 meters). Although heavier than a Danforth with
the equivalent holding power, the plow can get the job done in most con-
ditions. As Figure 10-7 shows, the plow is often kept secured up forward
on a roller with the fluke hanging over the bow. You never see this sight
on a racing boat — too much weight up forward!

Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

Table 10-1 gives you a quick rundown on what weight the anchor needs to be
based on the boat’s size, although a live-aboard cruiser picks a bulkier
anchor package than the average day sailor.

Table 10-1 is a rough guide to anchor size. If your boat is especially beamy
(wide) for its length, use a heavier anchor. Also, if you’re going to anchor for
a long time in extreme conditions, such as very strong winds, consider a
heavier anchor.
Securing the anchor and rode
The chain is usually connected to the anchor with a shackle (a U-shaped
metal fitting) and to the anchor line with an eye splice (a permanent loop
woven into the end of the rope) and another shackle instead of a knot. Knots
can come untied — and need we point out that the last thing you want is to
have your anchor line come untied?
Another anchor rode worry is chafe, and with an eye splice, you can use a
thimble (teardrop-shaped metal fitting that fits tightly inside an eye splice) to
cut down on chafing. (To find out more about eye splices, see Chapter 15.) If
you must use a knot, tie a round turn and a couple of half hitches or a fisher-
man’s bend. (See Chapter 19 for the lowdown on these knots.) Regardless of
the knot, you may want to further secure the bitter end from untying by seiz-
ing it — using a needle and thread to sew it.
With two strong shackles, you can attach the chain to the anchor line and to
the anchor. Use a pair of vice grips or pliers to really tighten the shackles and
then mouse them — run a few loops of galvanized wire or small line through a
hole in the shackle pin to keep it from loosening. Grease the shackle threads
first so that they don’t freeze up. A galvanized steel (which doesn’t rust) or
bronze shackle is best.
216
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Chain provides an important role in keeping you safe at anchor. The general
rule is to have chain that weighs as much as your anchor. For example, a 30-
foot boat with a 12-pound Danforth anchor needs roughly 16 feet of chain
attached to the anchor. Table 10-2 shows the recommended diameter of rope,
diameter of chain, and length of chain to use for different sizes of boats.
Again, shifting up in size and chain length is best if you’re anchoring in
extreme conditions or if your boat is heavier or beamier than average.

Choosing the right anchor line
Don’t use just any rope for your anchor line. Here are a few characteristics of
a good anchor rope:
 Long enough for anchoring properly
 Resistant to chafe
 Stretchy enough to absorb the surging load without yanking the anchor out
 Strong enough to hold your boat in expected conditions
Nylon rope is recommended for anchor lines because it provides the best bal-
ance of performance in these key areas.
So that you can easily tell how many feet or meters of line you’ve let out (cru-
cial for figuring out your scope), you can sew or insert small fabric markers
into your anchor line at set intervals. Never tie permanent knots in a line for
this purpose, because knots weaken the line.
217
Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

Remember that the basic rule is to use 5:1 scope. So assuming your boat has
15 feet of chain and you must anchor in water depth of 30 feet, you need 135
feet of line for average conditions and more line in severe conditions.
Resist the temptation to go up in anchor rope diameter. You get better
strength, but you get less stretch, which is important in keeping the anchor
hooked in rough, surging conditions. Plus, anchor lines take up enough space
on board already without increasing their diameter unnecessarily.
Maintaining the anchor and rode
A good freshwater hosing after use is important to keep your anchor gear
from smelling like the dumpster behind your local fish restaurant. Because
your anchor and rode spend most of the time stored in some dark compart-
ment, inspecting this vital equipment from time to time is important. Check
your chain for rusty or weakened links and examine the anchor line for chafe
or wear. If you notice a rusty or weakened link, make sure you replace it
immediately.
The most common place for chafe on an anchor line is where the line has to
turn a corner to come on board your boat. A good way to minimize wear is to
build a makeshift chafe guard by slicing a short piece of garden hose and
wrapping it around the anchor line where it turns the corner over the bow
chock. If you’re at anchor in rough conditions, periodically pull up (hard) or
let out (easy) several feet of anchor line to prevent chafe in one spot.
Anchoring with all chain
Some bigger cruising boats (60 feet [18 meters] or more) have all-chain
anchor rodes (and electric windlasses to pull up all that heavy chain).
Obviously, these rodes are much heavier, but chain is also stronger and more
durable than nylon rope. A total chain anchor rode enables you to use less
scope for given conditions. Although chain doesn’t stretch, it can provide
that critical shock absorption for the anchor because the rode arcs down to
the anchor. A pulse of wind or wave pushing on the boat simply pulls some of
this arc out of the rode, absorbing some of the energy.
Looking At Advanced Techniques
Sometimes you need to get creative and use two anchors. Or you may need to
secure your boat to a sea wall (a common method in Europe). The anchoring
chapter isn’t complete without showing you these two advanced techniques.
218
Part II: Casting Off and Sailing Away 

Doubling up: Two anchors
Securing your boat with two anchors can help decrease dragging and swing-
ing. One common example is setting two anchors in front of the boat so that
when they dig in, the anchor lines create an angle of about 45 degrees (see
Figure 10-8). This method is good for really rough weather coming from a
fixed direction, because each anchor takes about half the load of the boat’s
pull. A side benefit is that you can use less scope for the same holding power
(but keep in mind that the more scope, the better for rough conditions). The
benefit of two anchors disappears, however, in a big wind shift.
Another common use of two anchors is to set a stern anchor directly opposite
the bow anchor to keep your boat from swinging in a crowded anchorage —
but only where the weather conditions are quite stable and calm.
Setting double anchors is kind of tricky. You can set them from one boat, but
another way, arguably easier, is to set the first anchor normally and then
send a crew of volunteers in the dinghy out with an anchor and rode to set
the second one. Make sure that the bitter end of this second anchor rode is
attached to the anchored boat first!

Chapter 10: Anchors Away: Anchoring Your Boat

When I was with a television documentary team cruising around Cape Horn
and the Beagle Channel, we used a variation of this anchoring system. Of
course, no man-made docks or dredged-out harbors were around, but often
the water was fairly deep right up close to shore. To get nestled in as cozily
as possible and out of the icy blasts of the williwaws (sudden gusts of cold air
from the mountains), we dropped an anchor well offshore and then took the
inflatable dinghy into shore with two lines attached to the back of the boat on
big spools. When we got to shore, we found the two strongest nearby trees
and attached these stern lines to them (see Figure 10-9). This trick certainly
was easier than setting out two more anchors!
Anchoring Mediterranean style
Guess where this system is popular? Docking in the Mediterranean style, also
referred to as stern to, enables you to tie up with your stern (back end) close
to the shore, man-made bulkhead, or dock — when the water is deep enough.
“Stern-to” is the way the mega-yachts tie up in Saint-Tropez. Of course, many
places on the Mediterranean Sea have mooring buoys to facilitate your dock-
ing. If no moorings are available and you must use the anchor, simply pick
your spot on the shore where you want the stern to end up, and drop the
hook the appropriate distance straight out from shore. Then back the boat in
slowly (under engine power, please), until you get close to the shore or dock.
Secure two stern lines (one from each corner of the back end) to the dock
and adjust the tension of the anchor so that you don’t hit the dock but are
(hopefully) close enough to easily step on shore, possibly with the help of a
plank to bridge the short gap.

S
ailing fast — a powerboater may think that this is an oxymoron — but
we’ve gone sailing with a few professional car drivers, and they’ve been
surprised at how fast sailboats can go. Especially on a boat that’s low to the
water and gets plenty of spray over the deck, you always feel like you’re
going faster than you really are.
This chapter looks at ways to drive faster and use your weight to get more
performance out of your boat. On all dinghies and small keelboats, how and
where you and your crew put your weight can improve your boat’s perfor-
mance. This chapter also shows you how to sail fast boats like catamarans.
Understanding Apparent Wind
Chapter 5 covers the importance of knowing the wind direction. And many of
the “go fast” tips in this chapter reiterate the importance of feeling the wind.
However, before you try and sail faster, you need to examine more closely the
wind that hits your moving sailboat. The wind you feel on board your boat,
when your boat is moving, is the apparent wind, which is different from true
wind, or the wind felt by an anchored boat or a flag on shore.

To illustrate the difference between apparent and true wind, imagine jumping
on a bicycle and pedaling down the road. If the day is calm, you feel wind in
your face (apparent wind) — the faster you pedal, the more wind, right? And
if the day is windy, the wind you feel in your face — your apparent wind — is
the combination of the wind of motion, the wind blowing directly into your
face that you create by pedaling fast, and the true wind, the wind blowing
over the road.
The same phenomenon happens aboard a sailboat: As you move forward,
you create a wind of motion that combines with the true wind blowing over
the water, resulting in the wind you and your sails feel — the sailboat’s appar-
ent wind, as Figure 11-1 shows.
On very fast boats, this capability to “make your own wind” can have some
really amazing results. For mortal monohull sailors, the difference between
the apparent wind and the true wind is more subtle, except when you accel-
erate rapidly, such as when you catch a wave. Here are the key features of
apparent wind:
 The faster you go, the more effect your wind of motion has on the
apparent wind’s direction and velocity.
 Apparent wind is always lighter (less velocity) when you’re sailing
away from the true wind than when you’re sailing toward it. That’s
why sailing downwind feels warmer than sailing upwind.
 Sailing straight downwind can be slower. Super speedy boats such as
catamarans actually sail directly downwind (on a run) more slowly than
if they head up and sail on a broad reach (deeper than perpendicular to
the wind) and then jibe over.

Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

Don’t let apparent wind versus true wind confuse you; the sailor’s universe
still revolves around the wind that he feels. Just know that, as long as your
boat is moving, the wind that you and your sails feel is technically called the
apparent wind.
Sailing Faster: Go-Fast Tips
A gust of wind hits a beginner’s boat and the boat speeds up, but then the
puff goes away and the boat slows down again. Keeping your boat fast and
getting the most speed out of the conditions requires practice. The following
list includes many of the ways to get any boat zooming along and keep it sail-
ing fast:
 More wind = more speed. Wind is like boat speed — more is better, but
only to a point. Each boat is different, but most boats benefit from
increased velocity up to about 15 knots. At that wind speed, beginning
sailors should head back to the dock. Going downwind, most boats
respond favorably as the wind picks up to 20 knots, but with more wind
than that, control becomes a concern. For more on estimating wind
strength, check out Chapter 8.
 In light air, sail for the puffs. Look for the dark water, where the ripples
and other signs of more wind are. See Chapter 5, where we discuss that
darker water means more wind.
 Sailing on a reach is fastest. To review reaching and the other points of
sail, refer to Chapter 5. If you had a particular destination in mind and
could make the wind blow from any direction, you’d make your course a
reach. By sailing on a reach, you can sail on your boat’s fastest point of
sail and steer a direct course.
 Sailing to a point straight upwind takes longer than it looks. Because
you have to zigzag your way back and forth to reach a destination directly
upwind (as we discuss in Chapter 5), you end up sailing extra distance.
 Waves matter. Waves slow you down when sailing toward them and can
speed you up when sailing with them.
 Wind shifts matter. Check out Chapter 8 to figure out how to use wind
shifts to get to your destination faster.
 Some boats are faster. Lots of components determine a boat’s speed. As
a general rule, a longer boat with more sail area is usually faster, but
catamarans and other boats that can plane (skim along) are the excep-
tions to this rule.
 Adjust your sail shape for changes in wind speed and direction.
Chapter 12 shows you which ropes to pull to get the perfect sail shape
to harness the wind.
225
Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

Steering Faster: Driving Tips
Just as golfers work on their basic swing, you can improve your driving with
practice. To steer faster, try some of the following tips:
 Steer straight to steer fast. When most boats are close-hauled or reaching,
they exhibit a tendency, called weather helm, to turn toward the wind.
Weather helm relates to the balance of all the forces pushing and pulling
on the boat, its sails, and its foils (see Appendix C). Weather helm is like
driving a car that has its front end out of alignment — the tiller or wheel
“pulls” to one side. If you were to release the helm, the boat would turn up
until it pointed directly into the wind — dead-center in the no-sail zone.
But here’s something that surprises every new sailor and takes some
practice to master — you have to make small steering changes to keep a
sailboat going straight. As the wind changes in velocity or the boat
changes its angle of heel, the amount of weather helm changes, forcing
you to alter the rudder slightly to keep going straight. Although discon-
certing at first, a little weather helm is natural, and a skilled helmsman
develops a good feel of how to make the smallest steering corrections to
keep the boat going straight through the changing conditions. Keeping
your corrections small also minimizes the speed-robbing drag caused by
turning the rudder. Check out Appendix C for more on drag.
 Look around. Find a point (a tree or building) on the horizon where
you’re headed to make sure you’re steering straight, and look at the sails
to make sure they aren’t luffing (Chapter 12 shows you how to use an
early warning system called telltales). Then look at the water ahead for
approaching wind and waves. Also look around for boats (from all direc-
tions), then back at your point on the horizon, then up at the telltales,
and so on. Spend 10 to 20 seconds looking at each station.
Buddy Melges, the “Wizard of Zenda, Wisconsin,” is one of my all-time
heroes in sailing. He’s won the America’s Cup (America3 in 1992) and an
Olympic Gold Medal (Soling class, 1972), but, more important, he is a
great person who loves to share his knowledge. One time I asked him
how he keeps a boat in the groove going upwind in a breeze. He said that
he watches the horizon up ahead of the boat and keeps it at a constant
angle to the bow and luff of the jib.
 Practice “zen and the art of steering.” When the boat is in the groove,
the wind hits your face at a certain angle, the mainsheet tugs with a set
force, the rudder pulls on your steering hand just so, and the boat heels
a certain amount. Practice keeping the boat at that optimum heel angle,
and you’re sailing like a pro!
 Find that groove. Pinching the boat (sailing too close to the wind) is
obvious because the sails start to luff and lose power. As your boat
slows down, it slips sideways to leeward more because the rudder and
226
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

keel (or centerboard) are stalled. If you do stall out and get slow from
pinching, ease the sails slightly, bear off 3 to 5 degrees wider of a close-
hauled course, and get the water flow going fast again. But you don’t
want to bear off too far (called footing) or you’ll be sailing extra distance
and away from your upwind destination. Between pinching and footing is
the magical upwind groove, providing the best compromise of speed
versus angle to the wind.
Trying to reach a point upwind is a balancing act. By pinching, you sail
less distance to your destination (because you tack through fewer
degrees, as track A in Figure 11-2 shows), but you sail slower. Track B,
the intermediate course, provides the best trade-off of boat speed
versus distance sailed.
When it’s windy, a keelboat’s angle of heel can help find the groove. Each
boat has a maximum heel angle for optimum performance (see Chapter
12). When it’s windy, sailing too wide to the wind (footing) can cause the
boat to heel too far, which can also cause a stall in your rudder (extreme
weather helm) unless you let out your sails — but then you’re sailing on
a reach and not getting closer to that upwind destination (Track C in
Figure 11-2). So ease the sails slightly and then head back up to get to
that magic groove (and heel angle).
 React to wind shifts. All these go-fast tips would be a lot easier if the
wind never changed. But the wind is never perfectly steady for very long
(see Chapter 8). On a sailboat, shifts are named for the effect they have
on your sails and the angle your boat can sail (see Figure 11-3). In a
header, the wind shifts forward. If your sail starts to luff and you’re still
pointed in the same direction, then the wind has shifted so that it’s
coming from farther ahead (a header). In a lift, the wind shifts aft. In
either case, you have to alter course (or retrim your sails) to get back in
the groove.

Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

 Minimize heel. In Appendix C, we describe how a sailboat can sail
toward the wind — because the water flowing over the centerboard (or
keel) creates “lift” like a wing that’s balanced by the forces of the wind
on the sails. As the boat heels over, the centerboard or keel tilts with it,
so less lift is generated. The sails also tilt, becoming less efficient.
Bottom line: Too much heel is very slow, so try and limit it any way you
can. One way is by moving your weight as far to windward as possible, a
technique called hiking, as the next section describes. In Chapter 12, we
discuss how to adjust the sail trim if shifting your weight isn’t enough.
 Fine-tune your sailing skills on a dinghy. Because dinghies are much
more responsive than keelboats, you develop your “feel” more quickly
sailing a dinghy. In Chapter 5, we cover the basics of sailing a dinghy —
an agile, tippy boat. But because dinghies can capsize (some more easily
than others), make sure you review small-boat safety in Chapter 7 and
can move your weight quickly. Knowing how to swim is important for
dinghy sailing too, and don’t forget your life jacket!
Sailing Flat Is Fast: Ease, Hike, and Trim
The best small-boat sailors can anticipate the changes in wind speed by read-
ing the wind as it comes across the water. They keep their boats as flat as
possible (not heeled over by the wind) when sailing close-hauled (toward the

wind). Keeping your boat flat is easy in light winds, but to sail like a pro in
more breeze when a puff (an extra bit of breeze) hits, take one or more of the
following three actions to keep the boat from heeling:
 Hike out: Lean your weight over the side. Read the next section for tips
on hiking your hardest in windy conditions.
 Ease the mainsail: Let out the sail slightly to bleed some power from it.
When the puff is over, trim (pull) the sail back in.
 Pinch: Steer the boat a little bit closer to the wind so that the front of
the sail begins to luff (flutter).
Hiking out
Even on keelboats, moving your weight to the “high side” helps coax a little
more speed out of your boat. The right photo in Figure 11-4 shows a racing
crew with all their weight on the rail.

On a dinghy, hiking hard means a workout. If your butt is on the rail, you aren’t
hiking very hard. If your thighs are the last part of you touching the rail, as the
left photo of Figure 11-4 shows, you’re really maximizing the leverage of your
body. The following tips can help you hike your hardest in a dinghy:

Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

 Hook your feet under the hiking straps (after checking that they’re secure
and a comfortable length). If you skip this tip, you’re going for a swim.
 Make sure that the tiller extension (hiking stick) is long enough. The
steering stick or handle connects to the end of the tiller so that you can
still steer as you hike out.
 Make sure that your mainsheet (the rope you use to control the trim
of the mainsail) is as easy to hold as possible. Consider adding a
ratchet block (see Chapter 5) and/or a cleat (one that’s easy to uncleat
in a puff!).
 If you’re trimming the jib, hold onto the jib sheet while leaning out-
board. Now you’re using arm and leg muscles to hike and getting a great
workout.
Trapezing for speed
Imagine that you’re sailing on a dinghy in windy conditions and are hiking as
hard as you can. A really tall person of equal weight would be able to keep
his boat flatter, because he has more leverage. Because flatter is faster, off he
goes. But what if you hike out so far that you’re standing on the side of your
boat? Then you can pass that guy like you’re being shot out of a cannon.
A trapeze lets you do just that — stand on the side of your boat to maximize the
effect of your body weight. Trapezing is like “superhiking.” Whoever invented
the trapeze must have really hated to hike out or been a really smart person. A
trapeze system includes a support wire (trapeze wire), which runs from near
the top of the mast to a ring just above deck level. It also includes a trapeze har-
ness, which you wear with a hook at belly-button level in front, enabling you to
“hook in” to the trapeze wire, as Figure 11-5 shows.
Many dinghies and catamarans are designed to have one or more crew mem-
bers ride on a trapeze. Trapezing requires athletic ability, balance, and sailing
skills (to anticipate wind shifts and to keep from being dragged in the water
or flung around the bow by a wave).
The trapeze artist in Figure 11-5 is my 1992 Olympic teammate, Pamela Healy.
You’re probably wondering how Pam can tack while on a trapeze. As the boat
begins the turn, she swings into the boat and unhooks, supporting her weight
by holding onto a small handle on the trapeze wire. Then, with her other
hand, she uncleats the jib sheet as the boat turns through the no-sail zone.
When the boat is on the new tack, she leaps out over the water on the new
side, holding onto the handle of the new trap wire (yes, the boat has two
wires — one on each side). In her other hand, she trims in the new jib sheet.
Finally, she hooks in, and off she goes. An excellent dinghy crew like Pam can
go from tack to tack in less than two seconds.
230
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

Positioning for Proper Fore-and-Aft Trim
Sitting in the wrong position athwartships (across the boat) on a dinghy is
pretty obvious, because it dramatically heels one way or the other. Fore-and-
aft weight position errors (such as sitting too far back) don’t give you an
instant indication that something is out of whack, but they’re very important
if you’re looking to maximize speed.
Make sure that the boat is sitting on its lines — that is, level in the water
when you view it from the side, with neither the bow nor the stern sitting
abnormally low or high in the water. Keeping the boat on its lines usually
means sitting somewhere near the boat’s center of buoyancy (the central
point of all the buoyancy forces on the boat). If you could push your boat
down with a huge finger, the center of buoyancy would be the point where
downward pressure evenly sinks both ends of the boat.
Keep the following basic guidelines in mind to fine-tune your weight position
for proper fore-and-aft trim:
 Stay out of the “ends” of the boat. Generally, if you sit near the center-
board or keel, you’re close to the right spot.
 If you have more than one person on board, sit close together.
 In light air, shift your weight forward one or two body widths. Look at
your wake (the disturbed water behind your boat) to make sure you’re
not dragging your stern.

Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

 When hiking out or trapezing while sailing upwind, position yourself
at the widest point of the boat for maximum leverage.
 In strong winds, when reaching or running or if the waves start to come
over the bow, move back one or two body widths. This action keeps the
bow out of the water and floats the boat more on the back end, which has
a flatter shape, resulting in less drag for high-speed sailing.
Rockin’ and Rollin’ the Boat
You’ve heard the expression don’t rock the boat, right? Well, in most dinghies,
if you want to go fast in a straight line, then lose the word don’t. Kinetics are
techniques for flapping your boat’s “wings” (both above and below the water).
Kinetics include rocking (repeatedly rolling), pumping (repeatedly trimming
and easing) the sails, roll tacking, roll jibing, and sculling (repeatedly turning
the rudder back and forth). In windy and wavy conditions, some of these tech-
niques can give you that extra burst of speed that enables the boat to start
planing (skimming along the surface of the water) and surfing waves.
This section provides several tips to help you master some rocking and
rolling in your boat. (Just no head banging, please.)
Roll tack
Kinetics are so fast that the racing rules restrict them. However, intentional
rocking is legal during tacking and jibing maneuvers. Experienced dinghy racers
have turned this technicality into an art form, rolling the boat during tacks and
jibes so effectively that the boat actually accelerates during the turn.
Follow these steps for a successful roll tack, as Figure 11-6 shows:
1. Begin the tack by leaning in slightly, adding about 10 degrees of lee-
ward heel.
2. Start turning the rudder just like in any tack.
3. When the boat points nearly directly into the wind, hike the boat
hard to windward (windward on the original tack) to begin the roll
and trim the mainsheet in tight at the same time.
Keep turning!
4. When your butt is about to get wet, quickly change sides to the new
windward side.
Normally, you change sides when the turn of the tack is about 75 percent
complete (that is, you’re almost on the new close-hauled course).
232
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

5. Ease the mainsheet about 1 foot and trim the jib on the new side.
6. As the boat turns onto the new close-hauled course, the skipper and
crew hike (in unison) the boat flat on the new side, trimming the
mainsheet back in the amount that you eased it in Step 5.
The boat squirts forward on the new tack!
To start the roll
tack, crew heels 
boat to leeward 
to help turn boat 
into the wind as
skipper begins turn.
As the boat comes
head-to-wind, skipper
and crew roll hard to
windward. Skipper continues
pushing tiller away to help 
complete the turn.
To finish the tack, 
skipper and crew 
cross the boat, 
and quickly flatten 
it on the new tack.

Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

Be careful — too much roll and over you go in a capsize.
In light air, the skipper’s weight alone may be enough to flatten the boat
on the new tack. So the crew just moves to the centerline of the boat or
whatever position brings the boat level.
Roll tacking takes a great deal of practice and coordination between skipper
and crew, because you get the biggest roll when the whole crew moves together.
Timing is crucial. Starting the roll too early or not hiking hard enough results in
a lame excuse for a roll tack that may even slow the boat down.
Because of its keel, you and a bunch of your biggest friends won’t be able to get
much roll out of a keelboat. But by using the preceding rolling tips and keeping
your weight on the old windward side until the boat is through the tack, you can
still slightly improve the speed of your keelboat tack — especially in light air.
Roll jibe
Roll jibing is very similar to roll tacking and requires just as much practice.
Here are the steps to a successful roll jibe:
1. Heel the boat to windward an additional 10 degrees by hiking out.
2. Begin your smooth turn downwind with the rudder.
3. Grab the mainsheet and fling the mainsail quickly across.
Alternatively, the crew can grab the boom vang (sail control rigged
between the boom and the mast) to fling the main onto the new jibe.
4. Just before your butt drags in the water, quickly switch sides and
gently but forcefully flatten the boat by hiking out with your weight.
5. At the same time as you switch sides, give the mainsheet a quick pull
in to help acceleration.
6. Return the boat to its optimum downwind course and let the main-
sheet back out.
The initial change in heel for both the tack and the jibe helps start the turn so
that you use less rudder motion (which is less drag, as you see in Appendix
C). The second, more forceful roll gives you that kinetic boost of speed, as if
you’re flapping the “wings” (sails and underwater foils) of your boat!
As the wind comes up, all this rocking and rolling can be a quick ticket to 
capsize — so be careful. Rocking and rolling techniques work best in light to
medium wind. In fact, in heavy air, you may need to hike to windward as the
mainsail fills out of a jibe to keep the boat from capsizing. And you may need
to steer into the turn, as the next section describes.
234
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

S-turning in heavy air
An S-turn jibe is the opposite of a roll jibe but is the key to staying under con-
trol during a jibe when the wind picks up. Follow these steps for a successful
S-turn:
1. Start on a very broad reach.
This angle minimizes the turn needed to complete the jibe.
2. When the crew is ready, bear away (gently) to jibe.
Now is the time to pull in the mainsheet fast.
3. Reverse the helm about 15 degrees at the split second in the turn when
the boom catches wind on the new side and begins to blow across the
boat, steering the boat back toward the old jibe, as Figure 11-7 shows.
This “S-turn” counteracts the momentum of the boom and keeps the
boat from heeling too far when the mainsail fills on the new jibe.
4. A second later, just after the mainsail fills with a bang on the new jibe,
reverse the helm again and steer straight (or wherever you need to
steer in order to be on a very broad reach on the new jibe).
Have your crew keep the boat flat throughout this maneuver — every-
one may have to hike out right out of the jibe to keep the boom from
touching the water.
You’ve gotta rock it
You can actually rock your sailboat back and forth to generate a good head of
steam when absolutely no wind is blowing, as Figure 11-8 shows. On a light
dinghy, rocking works better than paddling.
After boom comes across,
turn back downwind as main
fills to prevent broaching 
in heavy air.

235
Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

Here’s how to rock your boat to generate your own wind:
1. Put the centerboard/daggerboard all the way down.
2. Set the sails to a loose close-hauled trim.
3. Have the skipper hold the tiller straight or, if single-handing, let the
tiller go where it pleases.
Or the skipper can practice sculling, repeatedly turning the tiller hard to
one side and then the other, propelling the boat forward.
4. Violently rock the boat one way.
5. Right before the boat begins to capsize (which is always a risk if you
aren’t careful), violently rock the boat back the other way.
Having the primary “rocker” stand up and hold the mast helps.
6. Continue until you reach your destination or collapse from exhaustion.
Planing and Surfing the Waves
Nothing compares with the thrill of sailing a small dinghy on a high-speed
reach, with water spraying off the bow like a fire hose. You may be going only
10 or even 20 knots, but the sensation of speed is greater than going four
times that fast in a car — really!

Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

Most heavy keelboats are stuck within the bow and stern waves that they
create as they cruise through the water. But given enough power from the
wind, light dinghies can jump over those waves and skim over the water, sim-
ilar to a speedboat or a surfer.
If you have enough wind, this skimming action, called planing, doesn’t require
any special action on the part of the crew. As soon as you begin to plane, you
know it — because of the huge smile that spreads across your face as you
realize that you’re going faster than you’d thought possible.
A close cousin to planing is surfing. Technically speaking, planing occurs any
time the boat breaks free of its own bow and stern wave and rips along,
regardless of the texture of the water’s surface. Surfing only happens when a
wave crest (top) grabs the boat and gets it speeding along, sliding “downhill”
on the face of the wave.
When we talk about surfing the waves, we’re not talking about going in close
to the shore break. You have a mast overhead, a mast that would get crum-
pled if you capsize in the surf close to shore — not to mention what would
happen to you and your boat.
The great thing about surfing waves is that you can surf ocean swells, power-
boat wakes — anything with a slope to it. Because waves usually run the
same direction as the wind, your best chance to catch them is when sailing
on a broad reach or a run.
Any surfer can tell you that to catch a wave, you need to be going close to the
wave’s speed. On a sailboat, you may need to use kinetic techniques (such as
rocking and pumping) to accelerate your boat when the wave starts to pick
up your transom.
In order to start your surfing career, follow these easy steps:
1. Get the boat pointed on a broad reach with the sails perfectly
trimmed.
If the boat has a spinnaker, use it for extra horsepower. See Chapter 12
for how to use a spinnaker.
2. If you have a centerboard or daggerboard, pull it up partway.
This reduces the drag underwater and is good practice anytime you’re
sailing off the wind.
3. When your boat is pointed downhill on the wave and is starting to
accelerate, give a good pump to the mainsheet by pulling it in 3 feet 
(1 meter) or so very fast and then immediately releasing it.
If you’re reaching with a spinnaker, you can pump it, too. The boat
scoots forward and starts to shoot down the face of the wave.
237
Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

4. Quickly slide your weight back in the boat to raise the bow out of the
water and enable the boat to sit on the flatter (more surfboard-
shaped) back half of the hull.
Now you’re surfing, and you can steer the boat straight down the face of
the wave. You need to trim your sails, because your apparent wind
moves forward the more you accelerate. See “Understanding Apparent
Wind” at the beginning of this chapter.
Don’t get greedy! Don’t stay surfing one wave so long that your bow plows
into the back of the wave ahead of you, flooding the cockpit with water.
5. As you get near the bottom of the wave (the trough) and the bow
starts to point uphill, turn to windward about 10 to 20 degrees to try
to stay riding on the downhill portion of the wave or at least build
speed so that wave passes under you.
6. When you feel the boat slow down, slide forward to your normal posi-
tion again.
Sailing on a Catamaran
If you know how to sail a keelboat or dinghy, then you can sail a catamaran,
because a catamaran, also commonly referred to as a cat, is simply a sailboat
with two hulls instead of one. Figure 11-9 shows a basic cat. Sure, some multi-
hulls are big, heavy cruisers, but we’re talking about the kind you launch off a
beach, around 20 feet (6 meters) or smaller. Note that a cat has some features
you don’t find on other sailboats, including a crossbar to hold its unique twin
hulls in place; the trampoline — rope mesh or fabric surface between the two
hulls; full-length battens in the mainsail; and a rotating mast to optimize sail
shape.
Because the principles of sailing a catamaran are the same as for any boat,
this section focuses on some areas where you run into significant differences.
Making your own wind
The big difference between cats and dinghies is their speed. Cats are faster
on almost every point of sail, in every wind condition. The reason for the
speed is twofold: The narrow hulls cause very little drag, and the “wide
wheelbase” enables the crew to sit very far away from the sails, providing
great mechanical advantage to keep the boat from heeling. The added width
is sort of like having a supertrapeze — in fact, many cats have trapezes, too!
238
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

Although catamarans, like any other boat, can sail directly downwind (with
the wind dead astern), the faster way to get downwind is to broad reach one
way and then jibe and broad reach the other way, in a zigzag route. Although
you sail a longer distance than when you steer straight downwind, the extra
speed generated by reaching up and making some of that magic apparent
wind is usually well worth the trouble.
Flying a hull
A catamaran doesn’t heel over — it flies — which is certainly the feeling you
get the first time the windward hull (which you’re sitting on) lifts up out of
the water. Flying a hull is the same thing as heeling on a monohull; it just
looks cooler, because the windward hull is so high above the water. If you go
too far, you invite a capsize (reducing your cool factor to zero).
Figure 11-9:
A catama-
ran flying 
a hull.
239
Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

For maximum speed, you want to have the windward hull just kissing the
waves, which minimizes the drag of the craft going through the water but
maximizes the efficiency of the sails and foils. You can get the hull back down
closer to the water the same way you reduce heel in a dinghy, by
 Hiking out harder (or using your trapeze)
 Easing the mainsheet a few inches to bleed power from your biggest sail
 Turning the boat toward the wind to bleed power from the sails by
pinching
Pinching works fine in most conditions. But if conditions are windy, you
can fly a hull when sailing very close to a dead-downwind course. In this
case, turning the boat toward the wind adds power into the sails, and
the boat heels even more. The correct reaction, then, is to bear away
more to slow the boat down. The only way to know which way (toward
or away from the wind) will depower you best is by paying attention to
your heading relative to the true wind direction.
Fully battened sails
Almost all catamarans have a fully battened mainsail — that is, the battens in
the sail go all the way from leech to luff (back edge to front edge). The extra
support from the long battens enables the sailmaker to build more area onto
a given mast-and-boom combination. Fully battened sails aren’t unique to
catamarans; some monohulls, such as the America’s Cup–class boats, have
them too.
Watching the leading edge of the sail for the small “bubble” that indicates
slight undertrim can be difficult on fully battened sails, because they don’t
luff as dramatically as “soft” sails. Make sure that your mainsail has telltales
(see Chapter 12).
Tacking made easy
Not all catamarans are created equal, and some can be a real chore to tack. If
you find yourself on one of those cats that has trouble tacking, try these steps:
1. Make sure that you’re going as fast as possible on a close-hauled course.
Do this before starting your tack.
2. Pick a smooth spot in the waves to begin the turn.
Hitting a big wave in the middle of the turn can stop your boat.
240
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

3. Turn the boat in a fairly sharp arc.
Catamarans lose momentum quickly so keep that tiller hard over.
If the boat has a jib, keep it cleated on the old tack and let it backwind (fill
backward) as the boat turns through the wind. At the same time, release the
mainsheet so that it’s free to run. The “backing” jib and eased mainsail com-
bination helps spin the boat down onto the new close-hauled course.
If the boat doesn’t have a jib, completing the tack can be difficult. Often, the
boat loses too much momentum and ends up stopping as it comes on a course
pointed directly at the wind direction. Congratulations — you’re now in irons.
Check out Chapter 5 on getting out of irons. Next time, try jibing instead.
Recovering from a capsize
When catamarans capsize, you can be in for some real excitement. If you
aren’t careful, you can get catapulted from the high side and land on the sail
or the mast. See Chapter 7 for the basics on righting a capsized boat, but this
section has tips just for cats.
The following steps can help you recover from a catamaran capsize.
1. Rig your cat with a righting line.
This inventive piece of equipment is a fairly thick (mainsheet-size) piece
of rope rigged for easy access in the event of a flip.
2. Avoid falling off the boat, if at all possible, by holding onto a shroud
(wire that supports the mast) or some part of the trampoline or hull.
If you do fall, try to land feet first (presuming that you have shoes or
booties on) with your knees bent.
3. Prevent the boat from turning turtle (flipping over all the way so that
the mast is pointed straight down).
Recovering from a turtle is much harder than recovering from a regular
capsize, when the mast stays horizontal on the water. If you’re clever
enough to still be high and dry on the upper hull, get off: Your weight on
the upper hull isn’t helping the situation and may, in fact, be adding
more pressure to sink the mast. Fortunately, most production cats have
sealed mast sections or a float attached to the top of the mast that
inhibits the boat turning turtle.
4. Lean your weight (and your crew’s) out on the extended righting line
(as Figure 11-10 shows) to pull the boat upright.
241
Chapter 11: The Need for Speed: Sailing Fast

Release the sheets first so the sails don’t fill when they do get dry again.
Then try to get the boat to rotate around so that the bow points into (or
close to) the wind direction. You may be able to rotate the boat simply
by standing on the “lower” bow, adding drag so that the stern blows
downwind more. If that strategy doesn’t work, you can try swimming the
bow upwind — a tiring task! Popping the battens in the mainsail so that
they’re convex (looking down on the boat) can also help you right the
boat, because as the sail begins to come out of the water, the wing shape
of the mainsail helps lift the mast farther out of the water.
5. When the boat begins to come upright, the cat reaches the critical
point of balance, where the upper hull falls down fast.
Watch out for falling hulls! Stay clear of the hull and the dolphin striker
(the support strut mounted to the front cross beam below the mast) if
your cat has one. As the boat comes upright, have the crew hold on to
the lower hull to prevent the boat from continuing to roll over and cap-
size the other way.
If you capsize on a boat that doesn’t have a righting line, you may be able to
create a makeshift one by tying a rope (the jib sheet may work well) to the
mast or “upper” trampoline support bar. The mainsheet is also a possible
righting line, but first make sure that it’s long enough and rigged in such a
way that you aren’t pulling up a sail full of water and that the sails will still be
fully eased and luffing as the boat is righted. Otherwise, the sails may fill with
air as the mast comes up, and the boat may flip back over again.

f your sails are the engines of your boat, then the lines you use to adjust
your sail shape, also known as the running rigging, are your throttle.
Because the wind and seas are rarely perfectly steady, the optimum shape of
your sail changes according to the weather conditions, just as the wing of a
fighter jet is different in shape from the wing of a glider because of their dis-
similar speed and lift requirements.
To optimize boat speed, some boats use different sails for different points of
sail or different wind strengths. For example, for the best downwind speed,
you may fly a spinnaker, a parachute-like sail. In this chapter, we discuss how
to adjust the shape of your sails, how to control the power in your sails, and
how to utilize spinnakers — all to garner more speed.
When in Doubt, Let It Out
After you get your sails trimmed perfectly at the beginning of the day, you
can just cleat them (tie them off) and ignore them, right? Wrong. The angle of
the sails to the wind can easily change if

 The wind shifts. A number of factors can cause a change in the wind
direction; check out Chapter 8 for more on wind shifts.
 You turn the boat. Every course change requires a change in sail trim.
When the angle of the sails to the wind is wrong, the boat slows down or may
even stop. So how can you tell if your sails are trimmed (pulled in) just right?
Looking up at the sails is your best and fastest indication of improper trim. In
simple terms, sails can either be undertrimmed, overtrimmed, or perfectly
trimmed.
 An undertrimmed sail — one that isn’t pulled in enough — is fairly obvi-
ous: The sail luffs, which means that it’s spilling air and thus losing power.
 An overtrimmed sail — one that’s pulled in too much — is a more devi-
ous animal. It also slows you down, but it’s harder to see because it still
appears full of wind. If you could see the air molecules as they travel
over an overtrimmed sail, however, you’d see that the airflow is stalled
(turbulent, not smooth), as Figure 12-1 shows. As you know from any air
disaster movie, a plane that has stalled can’t fly because the wings can’t
generate lift — and you know from Appendix C that lift is what makes a
sailboat move.
 A perfectly trimmed sail is constantly adjusted to maintain that perfect
trim. “When in doubt, let it out” is the first rule. Ease the sheet out until
the sail just starts to luff, and then trim it back in an inch. Repeat often
(unless you’re out for a relaxing cruise, then just cleat the sheet and
grab a refreshing beverage instead).
Relying on Telltales
Another way to tell if your sail is stalled is to use telltales as an early warning
system. Telltales are little strands of yarn or cassette tape that are attached

Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

(usually with tape) to the sail. Telltales are more sensitive to changes in the
flow than the sail is, so they luff sooner than the sailcloth does. See telltales
in action in Figure 12-2.
Telltales placed on either side of the forward-most sail (the jib, if you have
one) about a foot back from the luff (front) of the sail give an excellent indica-
tion of whether the sail is undertrimmed or overtrimmed. If the sails are per-
fectly trimmed for your course, both telltales (on either side) flow straight
back. If you turn toward the wind, the sail becomes undertrimmed, and the
inside, or windward, telltale starts to rise and flutter as the flow is disturbed.
Because the sail is already trimmed tight, this flutter is the helmsman’s cue to
turn away from the wind (bear away). If you turn too far away from the wind,
the air flow starts to get disturbed on the back (leeward) side of the sail as
the sail gets overtrimmed, so the leeward telltale starts to flutter and then
droop. You can either ease the sheet out enough to get both telltales flowing
again, or the helmsman can head up until both telltales flow.
When sailing close-hauled, you don’t really have to keep the telltales flowing
perfectly all the time. In fact, a little rise by the inside telltale occasionally is
okay, especially in stronger winds. That little movement just means that you’re
sailing a very fine line, and you don’t want to sail any closer to the wind.
On a mainsail, telltales on the luff are less accurate because of the turbulence
caused by the mast. Therefore, keep looking for an occasional slight “bubble”
in the front of the mainsail, indicating that the sail is just on the verge of luff-
ing, rather than relying on telltales. However, a telltale placed on the leech of
the mainsail (by the top batten is best) gives you a quick indication when the
mainsail is overtrimmed (and therefore is stalled) because the telltale no
longer flows straight back.

Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

Shaping Your Sails
The most important speed control — your boat’s throttle — is the sail’s
sheet, which controls the angle of the sail to the wind. But if you want to eke
out another few percent of power from your sails, then you must delve into
the subject of sail shape a little deeper. Come on in. The water’s fine!
You discover in Appendix C that your sail is really a wing, generating lift as
the wind flows past it. Figure 12-3 shows a horizontal cross section of that
sea-going wing with the following measurable attributes:
 Angle of attack: This is simply a technical term for the concept you
already know as the “angle of the sail to the wind.” You measure angle of
attack as the angle of the wind to the sail’s chord; the sheet controls it.
Check out “Controlling the power,” later in this chapter, for more on the
angle of attack at various points of sail.
 Chord: The straight line between the leading edge (luff) and the trailing
edge (leech).
 Depth: The fullness of a sail, expressed as a percentage of the depth at
the sail’s deepest point to the length of the chord.
 Draft position: The position of the sail’s deepest point, expressed as a
percentage of the distance the point is back from the luff to the length of
the chord.
 Twist: The amount the angle of attack changes vertically in the sail, from
bottom to top, as Figure 12-4 shows.
No one except a sailmaker is concerned with the absolute quantities of
depth, draft position, and twist. From a practical standpoint, sailors are
mostly interested in the relative quantities — making a given sail deeper or
flatter or more or less twisted.

Pull That Line — No, THAT Line
We’ve stated it before, but it’s important enough to repeat ourselves: By far
and away, the most important aspect of sail trim is the angle of attack, which
a sail’s sheet controls. Pull the sail in until it just stops luffing, and when in
doubt, let it out!
Of secondary importance are a variety of fine-tuning controls. Follow our
tuning suggestions in this section to get the sail shape in the correct range for
the wind conditions. From there, you can experiment with small adjustments
to see whether you can get more performance out of your boat. Here are the
basic mainsail controls (and see them in Figure 12-5):
 Mainsheet: The mainsheet is the biggie — the most adjusted piece of run-
ning rigging on the boat — because it controls the sail’s angle of attack.
When sailing upwind, the mainsheet also controls the twist. Read more
about twist in the “Controlling the power” section, later in this chapter.
 Outhaul: The outhaul controls depth in the bottom of the mainsail.
Again, getting the outhaul tension in the ballpark is most important, and
you can do so by using the same visual cues as you use to determine luff
tension (except that the stress or looseness is seen along the foot of the
sail). If the wind is moderate or strong, err on the tight side. Increased
foot tension flattens the bottom section of the mainsail.

Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

 Boom vang: Most boats have a boom vang (also called a vang) system to
control the twist of the mainsail when sailing downwind. Usually the
vang is a system of pulleys connecting the boom to the mast to hold
down the boom. The vang takes over primary twist control from the
mainsheet when the sail is eased out on a reach or a run.
A great starting point is to set the vang when you’re sailing close-hauled.
With the mainsail perfectly trimmed, pull the slack out of the vang rope
and cleat it. Then, as you bear away (turn downwind) and ease the main-
sheet, the vang takes up tension. The tighter the vang, the less the twist
on reaches and runs. A good rule is to put enough boom vang on so that
the top batten is parallel to the boom.
 Traveler: A secondary control for changing the mainsail’s angle of attack
is the traveler, but not all boats have a traveler. It moves the lower main-
sheet attachment point (on the boat) from side to side, thereby chang-
ing the angle of attack without changing the sail’s twist. When sailing to
windward in light air after the mainsheet is trimmed for the right amount
of twist, pull the traveler to windward so that the boom is on centerline
for maximum upwind power. In heavy air, you can reduce power by
dropping the traveler to leeward.
 Backstay: The backstay is the support wire between the top of the mast
and the back of the boat. Some smaller boats (and most dinghies) don’t
have a backstay, and some bigger boats don’t have convenient means to
control the backstay tension. But if your boat has a backstay control

Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

that’s easy to use, you’ll love the backstay because it gives you more
control over mainsail shape than any other control line except the main-
sheet. As you tension the backstay, the mast bends. This bend dramati-
cally decreases the depth of the mainsail.
 Halyard and cunningham (that clever pig): The halyard is primary and
the cunningham secondary in controlling the tension in the luff of the
sail. Some boats don’t even have a cunningham (also called the down-
haul), a control rope that pulls the luff downward at or near the tack. (In
Chapter 4, we discuss the two visibly obvious extremes of luff tension.)
Proper luff tension depends on the design and shape of the sail, your
point of sail, and the wind velocity. To eke out that last inch of speed,
you need to tighten your luff sailing upwind and loosen it downwind.
Increased luff tension usually moves the draft position forward and
decreases the depth of (flattens) the sail slightly.
You may think that a smooth sail is fastest. However, a few loose wrin-
kles along the lower luff are called speed wrinkles. In my experience,
most sails in most conditions like to have the luff tension set a little
loose. But beware of stress lines parallel to the mast — these lines show
that your halyard or cunningham is too tight.
Powering Up Your Sails
One great way to picture what variations in sail shape do is to think in terms
of power. More power makes you go faster in a race car (until you have to go
around the curve), but in a sailboat, it’s not quite that simple. When a wing
shape generates the all-important lift, it also generates drag (see Appendix C).
Therefore, designers of airplane wings and sailors trying to optimize their sail
shape are looking for the same thing — optimizing the ratio of lift to drag.
That ratio varies depending on many variables, including the depth of the
wing (sail), draft position, angle of attack, twist, and the speed of the air flow-
ing past. Every wind speed has an optimum wing shape that maximizes the
lift-to-drag ratio. (That’s why some fighter jets have wings that change shape
and angle, depending on how fast the plane is flying.)
Generally, in light and medium winds, you need full sails for maximum power;
at higher wind speeds, you flatten your sails because you need less power (and
because full shapes become “draggy” and slow as the wind speed increases). In
Figure 12-6, the better shape for strong winds is the flatter sail on the bottom.
Controlling the power
We can use this concept of power to describe the effect of variations in sail
shape. We start with the most important variations, moving to the least
important.
249
Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

 Angle of attack: Imagine that your boat is pointed on a reach (with the
wind coming across the boat) and your sail is luffing — this is 0-degree
angle of attack. As you trim the sail in with the mainsheet, you increase the
angle of attack until the point where the sail gets overtrimmed and stalls,
as Figure 12-7 shows. The traveler can also change the angle of attack.
 Twist: If the top of the sail has a 0-degree angle of attack to the wind (then
it’s luffing!) and the bottom of the sail is perfectly trimmed to the wind,
then the sail has a very twisty shape. Power increases with less twist — to
a point (see the “Why twist at all?” sidebar in this chapter). You can power
up the sail by decreasing twist to the point that both the top and the
bottom of the sail are perfectly trimmed (best angle of attack). The vang
and the mainsheet affect twist. For an illustration of twist, see Figure 12-4.
 Depth: Power increases with depth — at least until the winds get
stronger, when a deep shape has quite a bit of drag. You can change the
depth by adjusting the outhaul, backstay, and mast bend.

 Draft position: Draft position primarily affects the sail’s capability to
accelerate. Draft farther forward (about 45 percent or so) is a great accel-
erating shape — good for light or moderate air and waves that are con-
stantly slowing the boat down. Draft farther aft (50 percent or more) is a
better shape for straight-line speed in constant conditions. You can move
the draft by adjusting luff tension and secondarily by adjusting depth.
Reducing the power
On windy days, when you’re sailing close-hauled or close reaching (see
Chapter 5 to review), the boat wants to heel way over, indicating that it’s
overpowered. In this situation, you don’t want full power from the sails.
When the boat reaches its maximum heel angle (for optimum sailing speed,
as Table 12-1 shows) and the crew weight is outboard as far as possible (see
Chapter 11 for good stuff about hiking out), then you must reduce the power
in your sails. Here are five ways to do so:
 Ease the sheets. The quickest, fastest, and best way to “depower” your
sails is by easing the sheet and decreasing the angle of attack. Slowly ease
the mainsheet (or the traveler, if it’s easier to handle, but keep the jib in
unless conditions are really windy) and feel the heel decrease. Stop easing
when the heel is at the optimum maximum angle, as Table 12-1 shows.
Don’t worry if your sail luffs a little bit — you don’t want that extra power.
 Pinch. Slowly turning the boat toward the wind also decreases the angle
of attack. The danger here is that you slow down and stall out your cen-
terboard or keel, so pinching is usually most effective when done subtly
and combined with easing the mainsheet.
251
Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed
Why twist at all?
You may think that zero twist has the most
power, but that’s rarely the case, because of a
phenomenon related to friction. At and near the
water’s surface, friction noticeably slows the
true wind as the wind rubs against the water
and waves. Moving up toward the top of the
mast, the true wind speed increases. This verti-
cal variation in true wind speed causes a situa-
tion of great interest to sailors — the apparent
wind felt at the bottom of the sails is farther for-
ward (more from the bow) than the apparent
wind felt at the top of the sails. (See Chapter 11
for a discussion of apparent wind.) The fact that
the wind shifts in direction up and down your
sails (as long as you’re moving and creating
apparent wind) explains why zero twist is usu-
ally slow — because at some height, the sail is
overtrimmed and stalled. In most conditions, to
get your sail at the optimum angle of attack at
every level from top to bottom (for maximum
power), you want to set the sails with a moder-
ate amount of twist.

 Add twist. Adding twist is really just decreasing the angle of attack up high,
and depowering the top of your sail first is good to do. Add twist by easing
the mainsheet and jib sheet slightly. You can also move the jib lead back an
inch or three to add twist in the jib, as we describe in the next section.
 Make the sails as flat as possible. Bend the mast (tighten the backstay),
tighten the luff tension (with the halyard and cunningham), and tighten
the outhaul.
 If you’re still overpowered, reef your sail. See Chapter 7 on how to reef
(reduce sail area).

Heel too far and your rudder and keel will stall and slow you down. When
conditions are windy, especially on a dinghy, you have another good reason
besides speed and balance to limit your heel angle — if you’re heeled over
too much, the boom will hit the water when you ease the mainsheet. Check
out the “Rounding up” section, later in this chapter, to see what happens next
in this ugly scenario.
Trimming the jib
The principles of sail shape and trim apply similarly to the jib. But some of
the controls we cover in the preceding section apply to the mainsail only.
Because your jib is the first sail to “see” the wind when you’re sailing close-
hauled, take a closer look at some of its controls.
252
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

The sheet is the most important control, because it affects the angle of attack
of the sail. Get the sheet right, and you’re doing better than most sailors on
the water today! Simply ease out the sheet until the sail begins to luff, and
then slowly pull it in until the luffing just stops. When in doubt . . . ease it out!
As we discuss earlier in this chapter in “Relying on Telltales,” telltales can be
a very effective trim aid on a jib.
The halyard usually controls luff tension on the jib, just like on the mainsail,
and the same rules apply. However, the jib doesn’t have an outhaul to adjust
foot tension or a boom vang to control twist. The jib sheet does all that work,
with a little help from the jib leads. The jib leads, or jib cars, are the first fit-
tings (usually a pulley or fairlead) through which each jib sheet (one on each
side) passes as it comes from the sail on its way to the cockpit. (You can
check out Chapter 4, where we describe the rigging process of the jib and the
jib sheet, if you’re feeling a bit confused at this point.)
Jib leads are typically adjustable fore and aft and affect the jib’s twist. Move a
lead too far forward and, as you trim the sheet, it pulls down on the jib leech
too much, acting more like a boom vang and less like an outhaul. Move a lead
too far aft and, as you trim the sheet, it pulls out on the foot excessively but
doesn’t pull down on the leech enough. The correct setting is in between
these extremes, as Figure 12-8 shows.
As the wind increases, you move your lead back to twist and decrease power
in the jib. Some boats, mostly larger keelboats, have several jibs in varying
sizes and strengths. In general, you want to use the biggest sail in light winds
and the smallest sail in strong winds (for reduced power).

Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

Sailing Fast Downwind
All of the principles of trimming sails apply equally well on all points of sail.
The only difference is that, on the broadest points of sail (when the wind is
coming from behind), the boat is heeling less. So to sail faster downwind, you
often can increase the power of the sails, or put up a bigger, more powerful
sail, such as a spinnaker (a large, lightweight, balloonlike sail). But if you
don’t have one, or if your crew is on a coffee break and refuses to put up the
spinnaker, you can try some of the following trimming tips for getting more
speed from your boat and sails while sailing downwind.
 Make sure the mainsail (and the jib, if it’s set) is sheeted properly,
right on the verge of luffing. If the wind is coming from too far behind
(broad reaching or running), the mainsail can’t luff because the boom
hits the shrouds, and you may need to wing out the jib to get it to fill, as
we describe in Chapter 5.
 Ease the luff tension (halyard and/or the cunningham) to make the
sails as full and powerful as possible.
 Ease the outhaul to deepen the lower section of the mainsail.
 If the jib is still being trimmed on the leeward side, move the lead for-
ward and outboard (about 1 foot on a 30-foot boat).
 On a dinghy, pull up the centerboard halfway to reduce drag.
 Set the boom vang to limit mainsail twist.
Setting a symmetrical spinnaker
Now for the fun sail — the spinnaker. Setting a spinnaker when going on a
reach or downwind can be like lighting up the afterburners on a jet aircraft.
Sailing with a spinnaker is fast, but because it’s attached only at the corners,
you can easily get into a love-hate relationship with this potentially unruly
sail. Fortunately, you have this book, so get ready to love this big, fat, color-
ful, nylon parachute. Two types of spinnakers exist: symmetrical and asym-
metrical, as Figure 12-9 shows. Asymmetrical spinnakers are also called
gennakers, because they’re designed to be flown like a big jib (genoa) but
have the sail area of a spinnaker. They’re popular cruising sails because of
their ease of use.
We start with the symmetrical spinnaker, because as soon as you master that
big sail, the asymmetrical is a breeze (bad sailing pun). But, in fact, many of
the techniques in this section apply equally to both types of spinnakers.

Gathering your spinnaker equipment
Before you can set a spinnaker, you need the following equipment. (Check out
Figure 12-10 for a clear illustration.)
 Spinnaker pole: A lightweight pole that attaches to the mast and sup-
ports the tack of the spinnaker when set.
 Topping lift (also called the pole lift or topper): Halyardlike control
rope running from the mast, used to lift the outboard tip of the spin-
naker pole into position.
 Foreguy or downhaul: Rope coming from the foredeck area, used to
keep the outboard tip of the spinnaker pole from lifting too high.
 Spinnaker halyard: Rope used to hoist the spinnaker.
 Spinnaker sheets: Control ropes on either side of the boat used to adjust
the sail’s angle of attack. When the spinnaker is flying, these sheets change
their names — the sheet on the windward side that goes through the fitting
at the end of the spinnaker pole is called the guy or afterguy. The sheet on
the leeward side is still the sheet. Of course, when you jibe, they swap
names, because now the wind is blowing on the opposite side of the boat.
The number of spinnaker sheets you use depends on the boat’s deck
layout, size, and jibing method. Some boats employ just one sheet per side
while others use two sheets (a dedicated guy and sheet) on each side (lazy
guy and sheet method) as shown in Figure 12-10.

Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

Preparing to hoist
Because spinnakers are made of ultra-lightweight cloth, they’re most easily
stored stuffed into a sail bag, or spinnaker turtle. Like its close cousin the
parachute, a spinnaker must be meticulously prepared so that it deploys cor-
rectly. Nothing is more frustrating than expecting to see a big, powerful sail
fill with air and, instead, seeing a twisted mass of nylon.
One of the most embarrassing moments in sailing is when a crew hoists a sail
sideways. Don’t laugh, because all of us have done it by mixing up the sail’s
corners when rigging. To save your pride, write each corner’s name on the
sail in permanent marker — that works well on a spinnaker, because it has no
bolt ropes.
You can choose from several methods of packing the chute (sailor’s slang for
spinnaker), but they all have one thing in common: When the sail is stuffed
back into its bag, all three corners are clearly separated, ready for attaching
to their respective sheets and halyard, with no twists in the body of the sail.
Some racing crews on boats over 35 feet (11 meters) go one step further and
compress the body of the spinnaker with yarn or rubber bands so that it can
be fully hoisted before it fills. This extra effort is nice but not necessary in all
but the windiest conditions, as long as you use the cruising hoist, which we
describe in the “Hoisting: The ‘cruising set’” section, later in this chapter.

Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

As you see in Figure 12-11, packing the chute is easiest on a nice big lawn,
where you can stretch the sail out, untangle any twists, and stuff it in the bag
carefully, starting on its centerline and working toward the head and the two
clews (until a chute is flying, it’s said to have two clews and two leeches).
The three corners of the sail (the head and clews) should be on top.
Sometimes a nice big lawn isn’t available for packing — such as while you’re
afloat — but, fortunately, you can pack the chute within the confines of the
boat’s interior, with some creativity. Try tucking the head of the sail under a
bunk cushion and make sure the chute doesn’t twist!
If you’re in a rush, your spinnaker still stands a very good chance of setting
cleanly if you run one of the leeches (sliding your hands from one edge to the
other and making sure there aren’t any twists) and then don’t twist the two
corners attached to that edge when stuffing the sail into the bag. Your odds
get even better when you run both leeches.
Hooking up the spinnaker
In preparation for the set, the three corners of the spinnaker need to be
attached to the three control ropes — the halyard and the two sheets. You
may think that hooking up the ropes to the corners is a simple task, but, for
some reason, this chore is the source of many problems. Here are some tips
to make this job easier:
 All three ropes should follow the same path to the sail. If the sheets
come in under the jib, then the halyard should too.
 Attach the halyard and sheets securely and to the correct corner.
Writing “head” on the head of the sail and so on really helps.

Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

 Make extra sure that your sheets and halyards are led properly. Check
that you haven’t made any loops around stanchions, spreaders, and
other paraphernalia in their paths.
Hoisting: The “cruising set”
Being deliberate with each stage of setting the spinnaker pays off. Nothing is
worse than a spinnaker filling when it’s halfway hoisted, because then the
halyard has tons of load as you haul it to the top. Here are the steps to a con-
servative spinnaker-setting procedure that Peter calls a cruising set. The
beauty of this set is that the sail doesn’t fill until you’re ready for it.
1. Make sure that the spinnaker is attached to the sheets and halyard
properly and that the bag is secured to the boat.
2. Connect the inboard end of the spinnaker pole to the mast, attach the
topping lift and foreguy to the outboard end, and then raise the pole.
The correct height depends on your boat and the wind conditions. Make
sure that the guy is running through the outboard end of the pole.
3. Turn the boat onto a very broad reach or run.
Be careful not to accidentally jibe. Turning the boat onto a broad reach
or run lets you hoist the spinnaker behind the mainsail — protected
from the force of the wind.
4. Make sure the crew is ready, and call for the sail to be hoisted.
5. As the sail is being hoisted, pull the guy until the clew of the spin-
naker touches the pole.
If you’re using winches, make sure that you have enough wraps on the
guy’s winch drum to take the load when the sail fills. For more about
winch use, see Chapter 5.
6. When the halyard is fully hoisted and cleated, set the guy to its proper
position, drop the jib, carefully turn the boat onto the desired course,
and trim the sheet as required.
Trimming the spinnaker
Trimming a spinnaker is similar to trimming any other sail. Get the angle of
attack correct, and you’re off and running. Your spinnaker will inevitably col-
lapse, because it’s a relatively finicky sail that requires constant — and we
mean constant — attention.
The key to trimming the spinnaker is working through a basic cycle. First, set
the guy, then the sheet, then the pole height. Like every other sail, the con-
trol rope that gets the most work is the spinnaker sheet. Here are the rules of
spinnaker trim:
1. Set the guy so that the pole is about 90 degrees to the apparent wind
when broad reaching or running, and ease it forward so the pole is
almost touching the forestay on tighter reaches.
258
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

2. Trim the sheet so that the luff of the sail has a small curl in it.
If you trim just a little bit more, the curl disappears, and the sail looks
completely full. If you ease just a little bit more, the curl gets larger and
ultimately causes the sail to collapse.
3. Set the outboard end of the pole height so that the tack of the spin-
naker is level with the clew.
4. Set the height of the inboard end of the spinnaker pole (if it’s
adjustable) so that the pole is horizontal.
Avoiding a spinnaker collapse
If you get a wind shift, or your helmsman changes course suddenly, or if you
just neglect it for a moment, your selfish spinnaker will collapse. Unfortunately,
the spinnaker doesn’t luff gently when it collapses; it flaps in a loud manner
that makes you feel like something is very wrong. The spinnaker can collapse
in two ways:
 Downwind collapse: In this case, the sail falls into itself, usually caving in
on top and ultimately hanging like a limp mass. The cure for a downwind
collapse is to turn the boat up toward the wind (about 20 degrees) until
the sail fills and/or bring the pole aft (trim the guy) and ease the sheet.
 Upwind collapse: When the wind comes too far forward for the trim of the
chute (too little angle of attack), the spinnaker luffs completely. The cure is
to turn the boat away from the wind until the sail fills and/or trim the sheet.
Jibing the spinnaker
Any maneuver with a spinnaker can be a trial, but thanks to the cruising set
(and the cruising takedown, which we outline in the next section), the most
difficult maneuver is, without question, the jibe. You know you’ve jibed suc-
cessfully when
 The sail fills cleanly on the new jibe with the pole set properly.
 The sail stays full during the entire jibe.
 Nothing (and no one) falls in the water.
 The crew member on the bow comes back into the cockpit with a big
smile on his face.
Here are the steps to a successful jibe (and check out Figure 12-12):
1. Make sure the crew is ready and in position.
2. Turn the boat down to a very broad reach (so that the turn during the
jibe isn’t very sharp) and retrim the chute accordingly.
Work hard to keep the spinnaker full throughout the jibe.
259
Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

3. Announce the turn into the jibe by saying “Jibe-ho,” “Jibing,” “Here
we go,” or anything else that makes sense.
4. As the boat turns, keep trimming the guy back and easing the sheet
forward so that the spinnaker stays trimmed perfectly.
Because the boat’s angle to the wind is changing, this step is crucial
throughout the maneuver. In a good jibe, you must continue to rotate
the spinnaker so that it stays full.

5. Turn the boat through the jibe while shifting the pole from the old
windward side to the new windward side by tripping (detaching) the
pole ends from the mast and old guy and then reattaching the pole on
the new side.
This step is often the hardest part of the jibe, because it requires fancy
footwork on the foredeck and coordination on the part of the foredeck
team, trimmers, and helmsman to facilitate the switch. And during this
step, the mainsail must be jibed too. Stop the turn when you’re on a very
broad reach on the new jibe.
6. When the pole is attached on the new windward side, the spinnaker is
properly trimmed on the new jibe, and the crew is ready, you can
turn up to a sharper reach (requiring further trimming of the spin-
naker) if you desire.
Think rotation! One of the most common errors in spinnaker jibes is not rotat-
ing the spinnaker around as the boat is turned through the jibe. The result is a
tangled mess, with the spinnaker often blowing between the forestay and the
mast. Practice jibing the spinnaker without the pole to get the feel of rotating
the sail with the sheets. In light air, pull the mainsheet in tight (overtrimmed)
or even drop the mainsail completely to facilitate this drill.
Whether you have a spinnaker up or not, a jibe can be a pretty wild maneu-
ver in windy conditions. The force of the mainsail swinging across and filling
with a BANG on the new side can generate a major turning force that can lead
to a capsize on a dinghy and a broach (rapid, out-of-control turn up toward
the wind) in a keelboat. In windy weather (more than 12 to 15 knots), the
helmsman can perform an S-jibe to counteract the momentum caused at the
moment the mainsail fills after a jibe, as Chapter 11 shows.
Taking the spinnaker down
The key to a calm and successful takedown is to plan it early enough that
the helmsman can keep the boat pointing downwind — hiding the lowered
261
Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed
Switching the pole: Dip pole versus end for end
Depending on the type of boat, your bowman
(foreward crew) can use one of two methods for
shifting the pole. The end-for-end jibe is common
on dinghies and smaller keelboats. During the
jibe, the two pole ends are disconnected from
the mast and old guy and reattached so that the
old inboard end is attached to the new guy, and
the pole is pushed out so that the old outboard
end can be attached to the mast.
The dip-pole jibe is common on keelboats
longer than 40 feet (12 meters). During the 
jibe, the pole’s outboard end is disconnected
from the old guy, lowered so that it can swing
behind the forestay, and then connected to the
new guy and raised up into position on the new
windward side.

spinnaker behind the mainsail until everything is cleaned up. Here are the
steps to a cruising takedown:
1. Turn the boat onto a very broad reach and hoist the jib.
2. Collapse the spinnaker by easing the guy forward and pulling in the
sheet.
The sail collapses and is docile, protected from the wind behind the
mainsail.
3. Grab the sheet and begin pulling the sail on board.
4. Ease the halyard in concert with the sail being pulled in so it doesn’t
fall into the water (drops too fast) or require a struggle by the take-
down team (drops too slow).
5. Stuff the spinnaker into the forward hatch (if you have one) or into
the back hatch or spinnaker bag on a smaller boat.
6. Lower the pole and secure it and the spinnaker sheets.
When Peter raced in the America’s Cup, his team had four different varieties
of takedowns. Dinghies and smaller keelboats often take the spinnaker down
on the windward side in races. You can also find several other types of racing
spinnaker sets. But those methods all require tons of practice, whereas the
good ol’ cruising set and takedown work on any boat and are the easiest way
to get that colorful sail up and down.
Setting an asymmetrical spinnaker
Asymmetrical spinnakers, or A-sails, are a great evolution of the spinnaker.
Configured correctly, they have all the spinnaker’s advantages (more speed
for downwind sailing) but are easier for the crew to manage.
A-sails have a luff longer than the leech and, unlike the spinnaker, always are set
with the same edge (the luff) forward — just like a jib. An asymmetrical spin-
naker usually doesn’t have a guy; it simply has a tack line that holds the tack
(front corner) of the sail down to the bow or a built-in bow pole called a sprit.
At the clew are two sheets, one for the left side and one for the right, just like
a jib. For sets and takedowns, you can still use the cruising method of bear-
ing away to hide the sail behind the mainsail to avoid problems. Jibes are
easy because you don’t have a pole to shift (except on the few boats that fly
these sails from spinnaker poles — more about that in a minute), and the sail
is meant to collapse as it jibes, blowing around in front of the boat.
The techniques for preparing the sail for the set are similar to a spinnaker,
and, when hoisted, the trimming techniques of an A-sail are also analogous.
Some racing keelboats use both A-sails and spinnakers and therefore set the
tack of their A-sail on a spinnaker pole. Other racing keelboats use only
262
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

A-sails but employ a spinnaker pole rather than a sprit. In either case, jibing
the A-sail becomes a major production and very labor intensive. For this A-
sail with pole combination, you have a plethora of rigging methods available
for setting up the two guys and for the procedure for shifting the pole from
one side of the headstay to the other during the jibe. The bottom line is that
these boats are giving up the ease-of-use advantages of an A-sail in the quest
for a bit more speed. The trade-off may be worth it on some bigger racing
boats but not for cruisers and recreational sailors.
Losing Control in Strong Winds
Before you read this section, we urge you to read the “Reducing the power”
section, earlier in this chapter. If you feel like keeping the power on and find-
ing your boat’s limits, then you can use all the go-fast tips in this chapter
(and Chapter 11) in stronger winds and bigger waves. But we should warn
you about two kinds of wipe-outs: rounding up and rounding down. The other
name for rounding down is the death roll — see why we wanted to warn you?
But don’t worry. You’ll survive and have a great story to tell later.
Rounding up
Broaching, or rounding up, can occur on any type of boat on any point of sail,
but it’s most common when you’re sailing off the wind. Rounding up occurs
when a massive amount of weather helm (which we describe in Chapter 11)
from all the forces acting on the boat causes the boat to “round up” swiftly
toward the wind. In a round up, you feel as though the rudder is gone, because
you have no steering control. Actually, the rudder is just stalled. Telltale signs —
increasing weather helm and increasing heel — precede a round up. The follow-
ing list provides a few ways to avoid this embarrassing (and potentially haz-
ardous) fate when sailing on a windy reach:
 Ease the boom vang. This tip is especially important when the boat is
heeling so much that the boom is close to the water.
 Move the crew weight back. This action keeps more of the rudder in
the water. Make sure the crew is hiking, too.
 Play the mainsheet aggressively. In big wind and waves, you must play
the mainsail to keep the boat “on its feet.” The helmsman should ask the
trimmer (sometimes one and the same on a dinghy) for a quick ease if
he starts feeling weather helm building.
 “Pump” the rudder. By rapidly jerking the helm from “straight” to “bear-
ing away sharply” and then back to “straight,” you may avoid stalling
and help the rudder stay gripped to the water.
 Reduce heel. See Chapter 11 and this chapter for ideas such as flattening
your sails and pulling up your centerboard partway (if you have one).
263
Chapter 12: Trimming Your Sails for Speed

If you do broach, make sure all the crew is still aboard and hanging on tight.
Then put the helm to center, ease all the sails, and try, with what little forward
motion you have left, to coax the boat back away from the wind again by jerk-
ing the rudder hard to bear off. If you’re flying a spinnaker or an A-sail, you may
need to take it down to get the boat back on its feet. Keep the guy (or tack rope
on an A-sail) on tight and let the sheet out all the way so the sail luffs. You may
have to drop the halyard and then pull the sail in from that remaining corner.
Rounding down
The round down, or death roll, is probably the most spectacular crash. It
occurs most commonly on dinghies, resulting in a capsize, although keel-
boats aren’t totally immune. The round down starts with the boat sailing on a
very broad reach, run, or by the lee (Chapter 5 covers the points of sail). In
strong winds, if you let the spinnaker fly too far to windward of the boat, or if
you heel the boat to windward with too much twist in the main, the boat can
roll dramatically to windward while it turns “down,” away from the wind
direction. The forces start to multiply, and soon you’ve lost steering control.
Rounding down can result in a dangerous accidental jibe.
The following preventive measures can help you avoid the death roll when
sailing on a broad reach or run:
 Don’t let the mainsail out too far and keep the boom vang on tight. On
this point of sail, you want to minimize mainsail twist.
 Don’t sail too low. Turn the boat toward the wind until you’re clearly on
a broad reach. The higher the better — to a point, because as you turn
up you now risk a broach and may be steering way off course.
 Keep your spinnaker pulling the boat forward, not to windward. If
your spinnaker seems to have a mind of its own and is unstable, pull in
on both the sheet and the guy to fly the spinnaker closer to the boat.
 Keep the crew weight in the middle of the boat. Keep the crew weight
balanced, and have your crew be ready to move quickly to leeward if the
boat rolls that way.
If you do capsize in a dinghy, then we hope that you read all about getting out
of this predicament in Chapter 7. On a keelboat, you end up on your side, like
in a broach.
You don’t have to jibe, ever; you can always turn the other direction by tacking
and then bear off again (take down the spinnaker or A-sail first, please). In heavy
air, try to minimize any jibes — planned or not. And if you do decide to jibe,
remember to employ the S-turn technique, which we describe in Chapter 11.

A
s you read this chapter, one fact becomes obvious, so we may as well
state it upfront — we love sailboat racing. It’s our passion, so this chap-
ter is very biased. But hey, at least we’re warning you.
We’ve competed at all levels, and sailboat racing has enriched our lives in
many ways. Through our racing, we’ve traveled and made friends around the
world. JJ represented the United States in two Olympics, winning a Bronze
Medal in 1992 with teammate Pamela Healy and a Silver Medal in 2000 with
Pease Glaser. Peter was navigator for the Dennis Conner–skippered Stars &
Stripes boats that won the America’s Cup in 1987 in Perth, Australia, and again
in 1988 in San Diego, California. The victory tour included a trip to the White
House and a New York City ticker-tape parade. Peter has set several records in
distance races, such as from Los Angeles to Hawaii in a little more than six
days! JJ has been racing sailboats since she was 8 and Peter from age 13. If not
for sailboat racing, we wouldn’t have met and had the opportunity to write
this book. (Of course, editing each other’s writing has been an interesting
challenge. We’ve needed Marriage Counseling For Dummies occasionally.)

Whether you plan on embarking on a racing career or just want to know what
the boats are doing that you see racing on the water or on television, this
chapter introduces you to the incredibly diverse sport of sailboat racing —
everything from the top trophies in racing to the types of sailboats that race
to what you can do if you’re interested in competing.
Winning the Top Trophies in Sailing
Sailboat racing comes in many forms, from casual weekend racing to grand
prix professional racing with television coverage and even prize money. In
the 1800s, the sport of yachting — a formal name for sailboat racing — began
to develop. This section looks at the world’s most prestigious and competi-
tive sailboat races: the America’s Cup and the Olympics.
Which race is more important in the world of sailing: the America’s Cup or
the Olympics? Certainly the Cup garners more public attention, but if you
take a poll of racers, the Olympics would probably come out on top. Maybe
the Olympics wins out because individual sailing skill is a bigger part of an
Olympic Gold Medal. But for a top professional racer, the America’s Cup does
have something going for it — competing in it’s a real job.
The America’s Cup
The America’s Cup is the oldest international sporting event in the world,
and today it’s the biggest event in sailing (as measured by media and general
public interest). The event started in 1851 when a group of clever Yankees
sailed their quick schooner, America, over to England looking for some suck-
ers to race (and wager). They were unsuccessful in drumming up a challenge
for money, so they entered a race around the Isle of Wight in southern
England, and the rest is history. America beat 14 British boats around the
course (although some controversy stirred over whether the Yankees had
skipped a mark of the course) and took home a sterling silver ewer, renamed
the America’s Cup after the boat that won it.
For 132 years, the America’s Cup trophy was in the possession of the New
York Yacht Club — the longest winning streak in the history of sports. But in
1983, a team of Aussies with a very fast boat with a winged keel carried the
Cup down under. A U.S. crew led by skipper Dennis Conner (with Peter as nav-
igator) representing the San Diego Yacht Club went to Perth, Australia, and
won the Cup back in 1987. The winner of the Cup gets to host the next event,
so in the early ’90s the Cup races took place off our home of San Diego. Since
then, the United States, New Zealand, and Switzerland (with Valencia, Spain, 
as the Swiss team’s host city) have won the Cup. Teams from France, Italy,
Canada, Japan, Sweden, Spain, China, and South Africa have tried to win the
Cup and bring it to their home waters. The America’s Cup is a match-racing
266
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

competition (see the following sidebar, “Facing off head-to-head: Match
racing,” for more information) that typically features a several-month-long
elimination series among the challenging teams to decide who races the
defending team in the America’s Cup match — often a best-of-nine race series.
Over the years, the America’s Cup has attracted its share of characters.
Around the turn of the century, Sir Thomas Lipton tried, unsuccessfully, five
times to win the coveted trophy. He did, however, win America’s tea business
in the process. Other notable players over the decades include Sir Thomas
Sopwith (of Sopwith Camel biplane fame), Cornelius Vanderbilt (yes, one of
those Vanderbilts), Baron Bic (you probably have one of his pens), Ted
Turner (you probably get a few of his channels on cable), and Larry Ellison
(owner of Oracle and one of the world’s wealthiest men). Dennis Conner,
“DC,” shown in Figure 13-1, has won the Cup four times, lost it twice, and has
been at the forefront of the increased professionalism in the competition.
In recent years, the Cup races have taken place every three or four years, and
for most of the last century and a half, the fastest boat has usually won. Over
the years, a variety of large monohulls have competed for the America’s Cup.
The massive 135 foot J-boat Reliance won in 1903. After the 1988 Cup, the
IACC (International America’s Cup Class) rule was created. See the “Box rules
and development classes” section, later in this chapter. The IACC boats are
between 80 and 85 feet in length. As in any sailboat race, boat speed is ultra-
important in the America’s Cup, and teams spend millions of dollars on their
design efforts in the quest of a small edge.
If you have to ask how much vying for the Cup costs, you can’t afford it. In
winning the Cup in 1992, Bill Koch’s America3 team spent a record $64 million
over three years. Most of the money went into the design and construction of
an armada of boats, masts, sails, and other equipment. In 2003, Swiss billion-
aire Ernesto Bertarelli spent at least that much and (to the dismay of New
Zealand) hired away New Zealand’s top sailors, including skipper Russell

Coutts. Bertarelli was rewarded for his raiding efforts with an America’s Cup
victory and the opportunity to host the first ever America’s Cup in Europe.

The Olympics
Most sailors consider the Olympics to be the premier sailing competition and
the purest test of sailing skill, because the boats are strictly one design (built
to very strict measurements to ensure their equality). Sailing has been a part
of the Olympics since the Paris games in 1900.
Olympic sailing awards Gold Medals to the winners in 11 different classes of
boats, from a three-person keelboat to a sailboard. When JJ competed in the
women’s double-handed event, she competed in a 470, which is a two-person
trapeze dinghy with a spinnaker (see Figure 13-2).
Sailors often try for many years to first earn a spot at the Olympics for their
country (by finishing at or near the top at world championship qualifying
events), and then earn a spot for themselves because the Olympics allows
only one team per country per class of boat to compete. JJ and Pam Healy
trained in the 470 class for seven years before achieving their dream of being
on the U.S. Olympic team. JJ’s teammate in 2000, Pease Glaser, spent 15 years
training in four different types of Olympic boats before she stood on the
podium. Luckily, experience often trumps youth in sailboat racing!
At the Sydney Olympics, the sailing competition took place all over Sydney
harbor, even right in front of the famous Sydney Opera House. But in land-
locked Olympic cities, the sailing usually takes place at a nearby lake or harbor.

Facing off head-to-head: Match racing
When just two boats are in a competition, the
race is called a match race. The premier match-
racing event is the America’s Cup. Match racing
is tremendously exciting to participate in. And,
unlike watching other sailing competitions
(which some compare to watching paint dry),
match racing can be thrilling to watch. Before
the start of the race, the boats vie for control,
circling each other in an elaborate game of cat
and mouse.
Match racing has its own set of rules, which are
slightly different from the regular racing rules,
creating very close, aggressive competition in
which collisions are certainly not rare. Match
racing also has on-the-water judging, with
umpires doling out “instant justice” on the water.
A world circuit of professional match-racing
regattas is the training ground for the America’s
Cup hopefuls. Races are sailed close to shore in
identical boats, providing plenty of excitement
for spectators. Events take place around the
world, and most have prize money and televi-
sion coverage.

Racing Sailboats All Over the World
Boats come in thousands and thousands of different types, and you can race
any type. Additionally, races take place all over the globe, from Cape Horn to
the fjords of Norway. You can race model boats on ponds and ice boats on
frozen lakes. Some races are around buoys (anchored, floating turning marks),
and other races go offshore from point to point. Here’s a look at the many dif-
ferent types of racing.
Fleet racing: All together now
Races can be as short as ten minutes, or they may last for months. You can
race one-design (in which all the boats are identical) or under a handicap
system (in which boats of different types race together with the faster boats
owing time to the slower boats). The majority of sailboat racing is done in
fleets (hence the term fleet racing, in which many boats compete together).
One-design racing
Maybe the most competitive sailing in the world is in the incredibly diverse
world of one-design dinghy, keelboat, catamaran, and sailboard racing. Races
are hosted literally around the globe, and many of the more popular classes

(both Olympic and non-Olympic) have exceptionally well-organized regional,
national, and international circuits. Because the competing boats are almost
identical, one-design racing provides the purest test of a sailor’s skill. Figure
13-3 shows a typical one-design world championship. One-design racing is
the backbone of the sport of sailboat racing, and virtually all the world’s top
sailors have spent most of their sailing lives in one-design competitions.

Handicap racing
Handicap (rating rules) racing allows boats of different types to race against
each other by calculating how much time the faster (usually bigger) boats
owe to the slower boats. Fully crewed yachts more than 36 feet (11 meters)
long race in a variety of grand prix–level events around the world. Some
crews are professional, and many top international sailors travel from race to
race, living out of a duffel bag. Popular major events are in Sardinia, Kiel,
Palma, San Francisco, Newport, Bermuda, Sydney, Key West, Chicago, and the
Caribbean.
Box rules and development classes
Box rules allow boat designers to exercise some creativity as long as the boat
fits into a “box” of parameters (usually length, width, and sail area). Then the
boats compete evenly with no handicap. Some classes, often called development
classes, encourage design and construction creativity. Development classes
have produced some wild types of boats, including boats with hydrofoils,

amazing catamarans, and skiffs. (One popular type of development-class boat is
affectionately known as the 18 footer [pronounced eyedeen-footer] skiff in its
home waters of Australia.) Figure 13-4 shows a 49er — the Olympic skiff.
Team racing
Team racing is extremely exciting. Usually sailed in two-person dinghies, team
racing’s most common format has six boats racing, three boats per team.
Tactics and boat handling are crucial to this exciting sport, as competitors
try to hold back their opponents to enable their teammates to catch up.

Racing through the school years
Many junior sailing programs start kids racing
soon after they master the basics of sailing. Kids
race certain types of boats, like the Optimist
dinghy, the Laser, and the 420, around the world.
More than 100 kids compete in the annual world
championships in these classes. In the United
States, high school sailing teams are growing 
in popularity, and many colleges have varsity
sailing programs and recruit top sailors. College
sailing is generally a series of short races in
two-person dinghies provided by the host
school. Teams rotate boats and combine the
scores of two divisions. Both of us were colle-
giate All-Americans at Yale University, and
Peter was named College Sailor of the Year
after a stellar sophomore year.

Distance racing: Point to point
Distance racing from point to point harks back to the clipper ships of the
mid-19th century. The desire in Europe and the eastern United States for
goods such as tea from China forced shipping companies to build faster
ships. The clipper ships, probably so named because they moved at such a
fast clip, were sleek, narrow ships with enormous sail area and lengths up to
300 feet (91 meters). Trips from the Far East that had taken five months now

Around the world in less than 80 days
In a modern-day take on Jules Verne’s classic
novel, French multihull sailor Bruno Peyron cre-
ated the Trophee Jules Verne. The course is
simple: Start between England and France,
head south around Antarctica, and then finish
back at the English Channel. The winner must
finish in less than 80 days. In 1993, Commodore
Explorer, a fully crewed 80-foot (24-meter) cata-
maran with Peyron on board, just broke the bar-
rier in 79 days. Since then, several boats have
lowered the time by using faster boats and wait-
ing for the optimum weather window to start. In
2005, Peyron and crew cut the record to 50 days
(making planet Earth seem quite small). Also in
2005, Ellen MacArthur, a petite 28-year-old Brit,
captured the world’s attention when she sailed
the same route by herself on a 75-foot trimaran
in only 71 days. She also drew the admiration of
the British Royals, who promptly named her
England’s youngest Dame.

only took half that long. The discovery of gold in California and Australia
heightened the need for cargo space and delivery speed, yet the trip from
New York to San Francisco was an arduous 15,000-mile route around stormy
Cape Horn. Flying Cloud’s record-breaking trip of 89 days in 1851 was front-
page news, and the fastest clipper ship captains were heroes.
Many famous distance races today follow the same trade routes as the 
clipper ships of the 19th century. Transatlantic races run from Cape Town to
Rio de Janeiro, Los Angeles to Hawaii (the famous Transpac race), Chicago to
Mackinac Island, and Newport to Bermuda, to name a few. Yet today, the fastest
boats carry as little cargo as possible, and the crews eat freeze-dried food and
make drinking water (with a desalinating machine run off an onboard genera-
tor). Following transatlantic races on the Internet is fun, because tracking soft-
ware shows you the boats’ courses, and crew reports let you feel like you’re on
board (except you get clean clothes, fresh food, a dry bed, and warm showers).
Another major offshore race is the Volvo Ocean Race. Seventy-nine-foot (21-
meter) boats with ten crew members race around the world with stopovers
in various ports. These boats are fast, as you can see in Figure 13-5. The
longest and most grueling legs are in the Southern (Antarctic) Ocean, blasting
downwind at full speed dodging icebergs. That part of the race makes for
some great television coverage. Check it out at www.volvooceanrace.org.

The exceptionally rugged (and possibly antisocial) sailor can compete in a
nonstop around-the-world race — alone! It takes a really special person to
want to be in a high-tech, 60-foot sloop, racing as fast as possible around the
globe solo for more than 100 days. Needless to say, doing so is very danger-
ous, but check out the Vendee Globe race (www.vendeeglobe.org). The
Mini Transat class, 21 feet long, provides popular (and lower-budget) single-
handed offshore racing to a mostly European fleet of sailors.

Trying Sailboat Racing: Why Do It?
No doubt sailors have been racing against that boat nearby since man first
put to sea. Racing is a fantastic sport for many different reasons. This section
covers a few of them.
Racing is for everyone
Racing sailboats is for people of all sizes and all ages. Although some crew
positions on certain boats are very physically demanding (such as the
grinders on the America’s Cup boats), the most important characteristics of a
good racer are mental — concentration, quick reactions, analytical skills, and
a desire to learn. Even individuals with physical disabilities can participate in
sailboat racing. (See Chapter 2 for more info.) Sailing has been part of the
Paralympics since 2000, and sailors with disabilities have raced several dis-
tance races, including the Transpac race from Los Angeles to Hawaii.
Men and women compete equally in sailing at all levels. In 1995, JJ had the
opportunity to be a part of an all-women’s America’s Cup team, America3.
The race marked the first time that women competed head-to-head against
men at the top level of a professional sport. In any given local sailing race,
you can find women and men racing against each other.
Racing teaches sportsmanship
Sailboat racing encourages fair play because the sport is self-policing, relying
on a set of right-of-way rules (see the section “Knowing the Rules of the Game,”
274
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 
Racing with the pros
One of our favorite regattas is the Pro-Am at the
Bitter End Yacht Club in Virgin Gorda in the
British Virgin Islands. The resort invites top
sailors (such as Paul Cayard, Russell Coutts,
and, lucky for us, ourselves) to come race for a
week with the hotel guests.
We’ve attended several regional charity regat-
tas that auction us off as crewmembers to raise
money for a worthy cause. So check out your
local sailing magazine — you may have a
chance to sail with the biggest names in the
sport of sailing and raise money for a good
cause too.

later in this chapter). A few competitions have on-the-water referees, but
most sailboat races rely on the competitors’ sense of sportsmanship to obey
the rules.
Racers are at one with nature
Sailboat racing can have all the intensity of NASCAR racing without the noise,
the burning rubber, and the burning fossil fuel. You’re out in the middle of
nature just like an off-road racer, yet you’re not tearing up the tundra. After
your boat goes past, the only thing you leave behind is your wake.
To win a sailboat race, you must let all your senses work for you, from feeling
the wind on your skin to reading the water for clues to the wind shifts. When
racing, you have to sail your boat as fast as possible while looking around
and planning which way to go.
Racers always discover something new
Imagine a football game that takes place on the water, where the waves and
wind constantly change the playing field — that’s sailboat racing. It’s like a
three-dimensional chess game in which the board and the competitors are
always moving. Some compare match racing, the one-on-one racing format
used in the America’s Cup, to aerial dog fighting. In any type of sailboat
racing, you discover so much about the weather, the current, the hydrody-
namics and aerodynamics of the boat and sails, tactics, how you perform
under pressure — and the list goes on and on.
275
Chapter 13: Racing Sailboats: Going for the Gold
Sailboat racing in cold weather
Some people are so keen on sailboat racing that
they continue to race all year round — even in
frigid climates. Sailboat racing in cold climates
is called frostbiting — for good reason.
Personally, I think that any time you have to
break the ice out of a boat to go sailing, you
should make the trip very short and follow it up
with something hot to drink in front of a blazing
fireplace.
In college, I raced in a dinghy regatta on Lake
Michigan in late November. My crew and I used
rock salt (the stuff they throw on roads to melt
the ice) to keep the deck from turning into a
skating rink and the ropes from freezing solid —
now that’s frostbiting!
Iceboats are incredibly fast sailboats that skate
across the ice on runners similar to ice skates.
Iceboats can fly at incredible speeds — over
100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). If
you get a chance to go iceboating, don’t forget
your helmet.

Racing takes place in nice places
Sailboat racing has taken each of us literally around the globe. We have been
to some of the nicest places in the world, such as Bermuda, Denmark, New
Zealand, Australia, and Sardinia. And, unlike most of the other visitors, who
are shore bound, we get to go sailing. Now that’s what we call a great sport!
Understanding a Sailboat Race
This section has the big picture of what you need to know to race in the most
common type of sailboat race — a fleet race (many boats competing together)
around a course defined by buoys. Don’t worry — you’ll be back at the dock
in time for dinner and a nice hot shower!
Preparing the boat
Anyone with a boat can find a race to enter. But to maximize your chances of
performing well, you need to prepare your boat and crew. One of the most
important aspects of racing is boat speed. If your boat is slow, you can still win
a race by using clever tactics and maneuvering better than the competition,
but winning is much easier with a fast boat. Boat speed comes through prepa-
ration — refining your equipment so that it’s fast and easy to sail. Making sure
that your boat can handle the stress of heavy winds and big waves can help
you avoid the agony of a breakdown. Even the little things, like polishing your
boat’s bottom, can make the difference between winning and losing.
Preparing the crew
Some boats are sailed single-handed; others you race with a large crew. No
matter how many people are on board, the abilities, motivation, and team-
work of the crew are critical to success. A blown maneuver, like a spinnaker
takedown at a mark rounding, can cost dearly, but a good crew can make an
average helmsman (driver) look like a superstar. The crew constantly feeds
the helmsman information about wind shifts, wave conditions, and boat-on-
boat positioning so the driver can steer as quickly as possible without look-
ing around too much. The more competitive the racing, the more important it
is that the entire crew work smoothly as a team.
276
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

Entering the race
Local sailing or yacht clubs run most races. A document called the Notice of
Race explains the basic details of the regatta (a series of races scored together
as a whole): when the racing starts, what type of boats can enter, if you need
to pay an entry fee, when you can register, who is organizing the event, and so
on. You can usually find a club’s upcoming race schedule on its Web site with
links to registration materials and a downloadable copy of the NOR.
After you register, you receive a copy of the Sailing Instructions (SIs). The SIs
cover important details, such as a schedule of races, a chart of the race area,
and the type of race courses. Figure 13-6 shows you a windward-leeward
course typical for an around-the-buoys race. The starting and finishing lines
are imaginary lines between an anchored race-committee boat and a buoy.
A skipper’s, or competitor’s, meeting may precede the first race. The meeting
is a good chance to ask questions and learn more about the upcoming event.
As soon as you know what time the first race starts, figure out when you want
to leave the dock and make sure your team arrives early. You need time to
check the notice board (the SIs describe its location), pack your gear bag or
change into your sailing clothes, and rig your boat. On race day, it may take

longer to launch your boat than normal, with everyone leaving at the same
time. In deciding when to meet, factor in how long it will take you to get to
the race course area and give yourself close to an hour at the racing area
before the start for the first race of the day.
Before the start, crews develop their racing strategy by carefully monitoring
the changes in the wind direction and velocity and watching for variations in
current. Based on their observations, crews may develop a game plan to
favor one side of the course because it has more wind or some other advan-
tage. Crews also may use the time to practice maneuvers.
Getting a good start
The start is often the most important part of the race. A good start can propel
you into an untouchable position — or at least give you a better shot at a top
finish. A series of sound and visual signals from the race-committee boat
counts the time down to the start.
The goal is to be just behind the starting line at full speed, just as the count-
down clicks to zero and the starting gun fires. Sounds easy, but all the other
boats are trying to do the very same thing. Another prestart consideration is
which end of the line is “favored” with respect to the wind conditions and
278
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 
Preparing for your child’s first race
If the racing bug bites your child and you don’t
know port from starboard, usually your child’s
sailing instructor can help you make her first
race a success. Probably the most common
mistake kids make is to forget some key piece
of equipment at home, so feel free to run
through a checklist (sail, mast, parts, gloves,
hat, and sunglasses) and ask their instructor
about racing-specific gear, such as a watch,
gloves, and a rules book. Also, your child may
be too nervous in the morning to remember to
bring a dry change of clothes and a towel for
after sailing.
The key is making sure your child has enough
time in the morning for all the pre-race prepa-
ration. Even if the start isn’t until noon or 1 p.m.,
you may have to get to the boat at 9 or 10 a.m. If
the race area is several miles away and the
winds are generally light in the morning, the
race committee or the coach may offer a tow for
the boats. For more on towing, see Chapter 7.
Your child may not have room on the dinghy for
extra gear or even for lunch, so pack food,
water, and a light jacket in a plastic baggie or
small duffle bag. Bring another plastic baggie
for Sailing Instructions, and tape the page with
the course diagrams into the boat where your
child can easily refer to it.
And you can remind your child to apply sun-
screen and go the bathroom — he or she will
thank you later.

your competitors (see Figure 13-7). Sail to the middle of the starting line and
point your bow into the wind. If your bow is pointing toward one end of the
line, that end is favored (assuming the first mark is upwind).
Basically, the five minutes or so before the starting gun fires is a massive free-
for-all in which boats randomly zig and zag around until boom! At the start,
the mayhem magically becomes a spectacular water ballet, with all boats
lined up and heading for the first mark. If the mayhem doesn’t subside and
boats start prematurely, the race committee can recall specific boats (using
flags and hails), or call the whole fleet back for another try.
Against the wind: The first leg
The first turning mark is commonly positioned directly upwind of the starting
line. As you discover in Chapter 5, no sailboat can sail straight into the wind,
so on the first leg the fleet works its way to the top mark tack by tack. Of
course, a boat can reach the mark by tacking only once, but often, because of
wind shifts and other competitors, boats must make more tacks. Strategic con-
siderations include wind shifts — even a small five-degree wind shift affects the
positions in the race. Boats that head to the right side of the race course (by
first sailing on port tack) benefit greatly from a clockwise shift, as Figure 13-7
shows. But if the wind goes counterclockwise, those same boats lose out —
which is why you try, before the start, to figure out what the wind will do and,
during the race, you keep looking for clues to what the wind will do next.

Chapter 13: Racing Sailboats: Going for the Gold

While racing upwind, you must also focus on keeping clear wind in your sails
and avoiding the exhaust (disturbed air) coming off a competitor’s sails. The
boats ahead often try to “cover” their competition and force them farther
back. While employing these various tactics, the crew tries to keep the boat
sailing at maximum speed, adjusting the sails and the crew’s position on the
boat to stay in perfect tune with the changing wind conditions.
Around the mark
On the open course, the boats spread out across a mile or more, and then they
all converge at the mark before turning the corner. Mark roundings provide an
opportunity for the crews to strut their stuff as they set and drop sails (when
turning the first mark to go downwind, many boats set the colorful spinnaker;
see Figure 13-8). A well-practiced crew can gain valuable boat lengths with deft
boat and sail handling. Luckily, universal sailing rules cover which boat has the
right-of-way, or crowded mark roundings would be complete chaos.
With the wind: The downwind leg
Many race courses have two buoys: a windward (top) and a leeward (bottom)
mark near the starting line. On the second, downwind leg, the boats continue

280
Part III: Sailing Fast: Taking Your Sailing to the Next Level 

to focus on boat speed while keeping an eye on the puffs of wind and the
position of the competition. The boats in the back now have the opportunity
to attack by using their wind shadows to slow down the leaders.
The finish gun
Like the starting line, the finish is an imaginary line between two objects, 
usually a buoy on one end and a flag on the committee boat on the other. No
sound is sweeter than the blast of the gun as you cross the line in first place,
but you don’t need to win every race to win a regatta. You just need to be in
the top group consistently.
Knowing the Rules of the Game
In order to play a game with other people, you have to agree on the rules.
The governing body for the sport, the International Sailing Federation (ISAF),
writes the Racing Rules of Sailing. Every four years, ISAF updates the rules.
If you want to race, buy a copy of Dave Perry’s book, Understanding the Racing
Rules of Sailing. Dave’s well-written book covers the most common racing situ-
ations and helps you understand the tactics of racing while teaching you the
rules. You can download a copy of the racing rules at www.isaf.org or www.
sailing.org, or purchase a printed copy at your local marine store. To give
you an idea of how the rules work, we outline the seven most basic rules in
sailboat racing in the following list:
 Avoid collisions with other boats and any buoys or turning marks.
Sailboat racing isn’t bumper boats.
 You must start properly. The starting line is meant to be crossed after
the starting gun. If you cross before the gun fires, you have to go back
and restart.
 Starboard tack has the right-of-way over port tack. This rule and the fol-
lowing two rules are in force under the rules of the road (for nonracing
sailboats) and the Racing Rules (for racing sailboats only). See Figure 13-9.
 The leeward boat has the right-of-way over the windward boat. This
rule applies when two boats are on the same tack; if they’re on opposite
tacks, then the preceding rule applies and starboard tack has the right-
of-way over port tack. See Figure 13-9.
 The overtaking boat must keep clear. Makes sense, doesn’t it? The boat
that’s passing must stay out of the way of the boat being passed.
281
Chapter 13: Racing Sailboats: Going for the Gold

 When rounding marks, the inside boat is king. If two or more boats
approach a turning mark or some sort of obstruction while overlapped,
the boat on the inside of the turn has the right-of-way.
 You can make amends — sometimes. The penalties in sailing vary
depending on the Sailing Instructions. Some regattas allow you to exon-
erate a foul (when you break a rule) by immediately sailing two com-
plete circles (two tacks and two jibes) or by accepting a percentage
penalty to your finish score. However, in many races, if you foul another
boat, don’t take a penalty, and are found guilty in a post-race hearing,
you’re disqualified from the race — ouch.
How to Win — or at Least Get Started
This section contains our advice for mastering the basics of sailboat racing:
 Become a student of the sport. You can read a number of outstanding
books on sailboat racing, including Expert Dinghy and Keelboat Racing
by maybe the best sailboat racer ever, Paul Elvström, winner of four
Olympic Gold Medals; the Sail To Win series (from Fernhurst Books in 
the United Kingdom); and Winning in One Designs by Dave Perry (the
author of the other must-have book Understanding the Racing Rules of
Sailing). You can also find great magazines on sailboat racing, such as
Sailing World, Sail, Seahorse (U.K.), and Yachting. For all the latest sailing
news, check out www.sailingworld.com, www.sailing.org, and
www.sailingscuttlebutt.com.
 Enroll in a racing seminar. Check with your local marine store, sail loft,
or sailing club for local seminars. If your local college has a sailing pro-
gram, it may offer racing classes too. Here are our favorite racing semi-
nars in the United States:

 Find the right boat. Most racing venues feature active fleets of boats.
Some popular fleets even have casual races on weekday evenings. Many
dinghies (like the Snipe or Lido 14, Lightning, 470, and Tasar) are great
for husband-wife and parent-child racing teams. Make the effort to race
different types of boats and to learn all the different jobs on board.
 Know the rules. Successful tactics are dependent on using the rules to
your advantage. For example, as you get close to a mark, the boats con-
verge. So being on starboard tack (which has the right-of-way) on the
approach gives you a tactical advantage.
 Practice, practice, practice. In order to succeed on the race course, you
must do many things well. You must sail fast, work well with your team,
handle your boat and your sails smoothly, and acutely perceive the
strategy and tactics of the race. The best racers spend much more time
practicing than racing.
 Sign on as a crew member. You can’t improve your sailing skills unless
you get out there and sail. Many local sailing magazines (you can find
them at your local marine store) publish lists of interested crew. Put
your name on the list. Certain regions have on-line crew lists. Join the
local racing fleet and go to its dinners — most people like to race with
friends rather than strangers. And go to the marina where the boats
dock and introduce yourself to the racers. Sometimes a boat needs a
last-minute replacement, or if the weather is windy, racers may want to
bring more crew on board to keep the boat from heeling too much.

his chapter covers what to do when bad luck strikes and unfortunate
mishaps happen. Most sailors have their own great disaster stories — the
time they were aground until the next high tide, or how the mast broke and
bits of sharp aluminum rained down on the deck, missing them by inches.
The best sailors have fewer exciting stories, because they’re prepared for
most situations and can fix any minor problem before it turns major.
When something unusual goes wrong, you’re under stress. Because you can’t
walk away and ignore the problem, you have to deal with it. Keeping your
cool under pressure is very valuable when you have to make important deci-
sions that affect the safety of your boat and your crew.

Chapter 7 discusses basic safety preparedness on a sailboat, including practic-
ing a man-overboard rescue and recovering from a capsize. This chapter ad-
dresses the not-so-common emergencies that you can’t practice but that can
happen to you while out in a sailboat. Don’t worry — these mishaps are rare.
But just in case your lucky day was yesterday, read through this chapter so that
you can be the one who stays calm, knows just what to do, and saves the day.
Running Aground
When any part of your boat touches the shore or the bottom, you’ve run
aground. Usually your underwater fin (keel or centerboard — see Chapter 1)
is the first to hit, although we’ve seen boats run aground with their masts —
when they capsize in shallow water and stick the tip of the mast in the mud.
A grounding can be (hopefully) a gentle kiss or an ordeal in which you’re
really stuck with the tide dropping, or even worse. Most experienced sailors
run aground at some point — often in their home waters on a warm, sunny
afternoon when they aren’t paying attention.
288
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 
Planning ahead
Having a clearly defined game plan for the crew
to follow, with one person who is ultimately in
charge, really helps in emergencies. A great
example was during the America’s Cup races in
windy Perth, Australia.
During one practice race, a jib blew out, and
most of the crew (myself included) rushed up to
the pitching bow to help drag it down and set a
new one. The waves were throwing the boat all
around, and conditions were definitely “one
hand for yourself and one for the boat.” Despite
the talent and years of experience of the crew
on the boat, we bungled the recovery so badly
that Dennis Conner finally turned downwind to
give us a break, giving up the practice race.
On the way in, we discussed the problem.
Everyone knew that we had to get the tattered
sail down, but some of the crew stuffed pieces
down one hatch and some down another, cre-
ating a hopeless mess. We agreed that in any
subsequent situations like that, we’d let one
person, Scott Vogel, our bowman, decide the
plan for solving the problem.
Ultimately, that meeting won us a race, maybe
even the America’s Cup, because another jib
exploded in the Challenger Finals while we
were racing against New Zealand. Not only did
we get the pieces of the old sail down, but we
got the new sail up so fast that we retained the
lead!

Prevent those groundings
In order to prevent a grounding, you need to do more than just pay attention.
The following tips can prevent the majority of groundings:
 Brush up on your navigational skills. Be familiar with the nautical chart
of your sailing area, and if you’re in unfamiliar waters or have shallow,
tricky home waters, be able to fix (determine) your position on a chart
and perform piloting skills (see Chapter 9).
 Know how to raise your centerboard and rudder. On a dinghy, you can
often pull up the foils and slide over shallow waters. Just make sure that
you’re headed to deeper water!
 Know how to “read” the bottom. Chapter 9 covers how the color of the
water and shape of the waves can help you spot shallow waters.
 Know the depth of the water under your boat. A good depth sounder is
helpful for larger keelboats with electronics.
 Know the exact depth (draft) of your boat. How deep is your keel?
 Know the shape of your keel. Some keelboats get deeper when all the
passengers are in the stern or when the boat is under power. If you do
run aground, knowing your keel shape is crucial for making the right
assessment of how to get free, as we discuss in a minute.
 Understand the local tides. See Chapter 8 on tides. Have a local tide
book, which predicts the estimated range of tides, on board (available at
marine stores), but use this information with a grain of salt. You can
cross-check the predicted current direction with the wakes on buoys.
Don’t push it — but if you must sail over a shallow area to get home, sail
slowly (at half speed or less). Doing so makes it easier for you to get free if
you do get stuck.
When you go aground
So you’re out on a nice, sunny day for an afternoon sail and you run aground.
What do you do? (No, don’t cry into your coffee.) This section looks at the
ways to free your boat from a nice, soft bottom. Later in this chapter, in the
“Halting Hull Damage” section, we tell you what you should do in the rare
event that you hit rocks and sustain serious damage.
In order to free yourself from a soft bottom, try these tips:
289
Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)

 If you hit softly, slow down and immediately turn the boat to deeper
water. Hopefully, you can sail free.
 Send someone below to check for damage. Look in the bilge, where the
keel attaches inside the hull, for water leaking into the boat.
 If you have a centerboard (lucky you), immediately pull it up partway.
A centerboard is the center, retractable fin on a dinghy.
 Try to make the boat less deep. Heeling works for all sailboats, except
for those with a twin or winged keel, because it reduces the boat’s draft.
When you hit, immediately move all the crew weight to leeward, as
Figure 14-1 shows. If you’re on a reaching heading, overtrim the sails to
generate heel from the wind.
 Consider using the engine, but only in combination with some of
these other remedies. First, check that the rudder isn’t stuck — you can
break it by moving the boat. Depending on the situation, you may want
to try forward or reverse gear. Watch the temperature gauge — silt can
clog the water intake and cause overheating. And never put the engine in
gear before ensuring all lines are out of the water.
 Take the sails down if they’re driving you farther into the shallow
area. First let them luff.
Obviously, you should perform the preceding procedures as quickly as possi-
ble. If you’re aboard a keelboat and still not afloat after trying these tricks, try
one of these more involved actions:
Figure 14-1:
By heeling

290
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Really heel the boat. Drop and secure the mainsail. Then release the
mainsheet and push the main (supported at the outboard end by a hal-
yard or other secure line) all the way out to the side the boat is heeling
toward. Next, have some crew members climb up on it and slide as far
outboard as they can. Lashing the boom to a shroud or tying it off to a
forward cleat can free a crew member for other duties. Falling into the
water is easy to do while performing this trick, so this act is only for the
acrobatically inclined. Have the crew don life jackets first, and leave at
least one person on board.
 Get creative on ways to heel. If you have a rowing dinghy, maybe you
can suspend it (filled with water if necessary) from the end of the boom
to increase heel.
When a boat is heeled further than normal, check for leaking fuel or
other potential problems.
 Lighten the ship. Offload extra crew and heavy gear into a dinghy to
reduce draft. If you don’t have a dinghy, try moving all the crew to the
bow to see if that helps.
 Use the anchor to pull you off. This system, called kedging, or setting a
kedge, requires sending a rowing dinghy (or other boat) out with an
anchor to set. Put the anchor and sufficient anchor line in the boat and
head toward deep water, making sure that the end of the anchor line is
tied to the dinghy or the sailboat. When the anchor is set (the farther
away, the better chance the anchor will hold), start pulling yourself free.
Use a winch if you have one. Meanwhile, keep heeling, powering with the
engine or sails, and trying other measures.
 Wait until high tide. Even if you get stuck at high tide (assuming you’re
on a tidal body of water), you’ll eventually float free. Having an anchor
set in deeper water hopefully keeps you from getting pushed further
aground as the tide comes in. Try to heel the boat toward shallow water
so that the incoming tide doesn’t swamp your boat. If you’re really “high
and dry,” take heart — most boats are built to withstand lying on their
sides. Try to cushion the hull if possible.
 As a last resort, you can accept a tow. If your boat is hard aground,
pulling it off can cause extensive keel and rudder damage. Or the tow
line can snap and hurt someone as it recoils. Hiring a professional
towing service can be expensive (not as expensive as salvaging a sunken
ship, however). In case of a true emergency, contact the Coast Guard on
VHF Channel 16. (For more on using the radio and safe towing tips, see
Chapter 7.) The Coast Guard may refer you to a towing company.
291
Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)

Jury-Rigging Out of a Bind
A body of knowledge called jury-rigging (the fine art of replacing broken gear
with a temporary fix) covers many possible emergencies. Covering all the
possible jury-rig solutions is beyond the scope of this book, but this section
provides a list of the equipment and tools that are common to many different
solutions — plus some examples of how to use these items. Creativity is the
key to effective jury-rigging. Keep in mind that you can’t stuff as much equip-
ment into a small dinghy as you can into a big keelboat.
 Duct tape: Duct tape can fix just about anything, including a boo-boo on
your finger when you run out of bandages.
 Knife: A sailor’s best friend. Use a knife to cut a heavily loaded sheet or
halyard that’s hopelessly tangled.
 Rope: Sailors can do amazing things with rope. Besides an anchor line,
you should have at least one other rope that’s long and strong enough to
serve as a sheet, halyard, or dock line. A 15- to 30-foot (5- to 9-meter)
length of ultrastrong, small-diameter rope (3⁄16 inch, or 4 millimeters) can
be nearly as valuable as duct tape in an emergency. Braided rope with a
low-stretch core is best for this (see more on rope in Chapter 15). Sail
ties or webbing (strong, ribbonlike straps available at sail lofts) can also
fit through some tiny holes and provide great lashing material.
 Spare parts: The list depends on your boat. However, no matter how big
the boat, bring a few shackles (matching the size of common ones on the
boat) and some clevis pins or machine screws with nuts. A couple of
medium or large pulleys (blocks) are also great in your ditty bag (a bag
for good jury-rigging items).

Biscayne Bay blues
When I was part of a crew delivering a racing
boat back to New England from Florida, we
went hard aground at night as we were leaving
Miami for the long sail north. Fortunately, the
keel was stuck in nice, soft sand, and we were
in the protected waters of Biscayne Bay. So
after trying all the easy tricks, we gave up until
morning and went to sleep with the boat on a
30-degree heel.
At dawn, we put up the spinnaker (to heel the
boat more), put out an anchor, and ultimately
flagged down a passing boat to add some
towing power. When the tide rose, we finally
clawed our way off and were on our way.
Because going aground is kind of embar-
rassing, we agreed to keep the episode to 
ourselves — until a friend mailed me a copy of
the front page of the Miami Herald with our
beautiful spinnaker photogenically framing a
boat that was clearly very hard aground!

 Sticky-back: This stuff is also called insignia cloth. A wide (3-feet, or 1-
meter) roll of sail-repair material with adhesive backing can repair holes
in boats and in sails.
 Tools: A dinghy may have only a screwdriver and vice grips (although
we recommend a multipurpose tool), while an ocean-circling keelboat
may carry several tool boxes. Sailors often pull bottle openers (hey,
jury-rigging is thirsty work), hammers, adjustable wrenches, wire cut-
ters, and hacksaws out of the box first in an emergency. Don’t forget a
few good sailmaker’s hand-sewing needles, thread, and a palm (leather
device that fits over your palm, enabling you to push a needle through
many layers of sailcloth — sort of a super thimble).
So what do you do with all these good things? Use your imagination, because
that’s what jury-rigging is all about.
Overcoming Sail Problems
Without functional sails, you can’t do much sailing. Sails can blow out and rip —
sometimes from misuse, sometimes from simple wear and tear. If your sail does
blow out or tear, take it down right away, before any further damage can occur.
Depending on the size of the rip, you may be able to fix it, sometimes as good as
new. Your best friend in this procedure is that roll of sticky-back cloth you
brought aboard after reading the previous section about jury-rigging.
If you need to repair one of your sails, follow these easy steps:
1. Make sure the area you’re operating on is clean, dry, and salt-free.
You may have to rinse the sail in freshwater before it will dry completely.
2. Lay the repair area on as flat a surface as possible.
3. Try to position the torn edges into their original positions.
Getting the edges into position may take several hands.
4. Calculate the size of the sticky-back bandage (make sure you overlap
the edges sufficiently) and cut it.
5. Apply the sticky-back.
Start at one edge of the tear and work slowly to the other, trying to keep
the sail as smooth and as close to its pretear position as possible.
6. Press the applied tape firmly to the repaired area.
Use a solid object and press hard on the repair, sandwiching it to the
table or work surface. Really work the sticky-back onto the repair, espe-
cially any stitched seams that are covered up. For most sails, this repair
is enough. But if the repair is in a high-load area, like the leech of a jib or
mainsail, consider stitching the tear through the sticky-back.
293
Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)

Furling blues
Although roller furlers are a convenient way of handling a big headsail, they
aren’t foolproof. One common problem occurs when furling the sail after use.
If a light amount of tension isn’t retained on the jib sheet while furling, the
sail can end up with an uneven or unbalanced roll. The protruding edges of
the sail can catch the wind and cause the sail to partially unroll and flap,
damaging the sail. Always make sure your jib is furled smoothly.
Can’t get your sail down
Occasionally a sail gets “stuck” when hoisted. Often, this is because the halyard
has jumped the sheave (rolling part of a pulley) at the top of the mast. The best
way to solve this problem is to haul a person up the mast in a bosun’s chair to
inspect and hopefully fix it. (See Chapter 15 for the proper use of a bosun’s
chair.) If the problem is a jumped sheave, then disconnect the sail from the
stuck halyard so you can pull it upward to try to get it unjammed. If that doesn’t
work, you may need to carefully remove the sheave and then replace it with the
halyard led correctly over the top. But if a halyard jumps a sheave once, it can
happen again. After you get to shore, you may want to have a marine rigger help
you figure out a more permanent solution (such as getting a bigger halyard).
Fouling the Prop
Sailors sometimes must use their boat’s engine. A mishap known as “fouling
the prop” proves that power and sailing don’t mix all the time. Getting a rope
tangled up in the propeller is a drag; when it happens on a boat with an
inboard engine, the engine stalls and the propeller gets stuck, unable to turn.
Next thing you know, someone (probably you) has to jump in the water
(probably cold) and untangle the prop. Usually the culprit is a halyard or
sheet (or dock line or tow line) from your boat.
Preventing a fouled prop is simple. Keep your lines out of the water, and
always look around the boat before turning on the engine.
Unfortunately, people aren’t as vigilant as they should be, so here’s how to
deal with tangled ropes on an inboard engine propeller. (If you have an out-
board, what are you waiting for? Pull it up and unwrap the rope!)
1. Turn off the engine immediately (it may have already stalled out).
2. Find the transgressing rope and gently pull it with the shift in neutral.
Pull harder and pray, because if the rope doesn’t release, you’re swimming.
294
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

3. Consider whether you really need the engine.
If you don’t really need the engine, or if the conditions are too rough and
dangerous to go in the water, then you just have to sail. Keep in mind
that in big waves, the boat is going up and down fast, so swimming
underneath it, near the propeller blade, is no fun. If you delay the swim
until later, tighten the fouled rope and tie it off on deck.
4. You can try, as a last resort, putting the engine in reverse (dead slow)
just for an instant and then pulling hard on the line.
We’ve never found this trick to work, but you never know.
5. If the conditions are safe, or after you return to shelter, you can jump in.
Before swimming, stop the boat and make sure that it’s dragging a line
that you can grab. A mask, snorkel, and fins are nice.
6. Using the wrapped rope as a guide, swim down to the prop (engine’s
off, right?) and try to untie the knot down there.
7. If untying the knot is impossible, get your knife so that you can chop
that stupid rope into tiny little pieces.
Hey, be careful with that thing!
Steering Problems
Once every blue moon, the same fate befalls a rudder on a keelboat. The
steering system feels stuck because a rope is wedged between the top of the
rudder and the hull. Usually you can get out of this situation with a good tug
on the infringing line from the right direction. If not, turn the helm hard one
way and try again (you may have to drop the sails in strong winds). That usu-
ally works. If not, did you bring your swimsuit?
295
Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)
Cutting your losses
Have you ever noticed in the old pirate movies
that every sailor carries a knife? Well, that knife
isn’t just for coaxing the good guy to walk the
plank; it’s a valuable tool for every sailor to have,
especially in an emergency. A very sharp knife,
with a blunt point to avoid any accidental perfo-
ration of boat or body parts, can cut through a
highly loaded halyard or tangled sheet in a
second, often saving the mast or the boat in an
emergency, such as a sudden squall.

Surviving a Storm
Chapter 7 covers preparing yourself and your boat for strong winds. After fol-
lowing the safety steps in that chapter, here are some additional tips for a
really big blow:
 Feed the crew. Going into battle against the elements with the fuel tank
full is a good idea. If the crew has eaten recently, have someone prepare
the next meal, even if it’s just sandwiches. It may be tough to find a vol-
unteer for galley duty in the middle of a storm.
 Fix your position. Consider increasing the level of your navigational
energies, too. See Chapter 9 to find out how to fix your position.
 Set a watch system. If you’re on a longer passage, you may already have
established a rotation of the crew so that everyone can rest. A common
rotation divides the crew up into two watches, or groups (of equal abil-
ity), with each watch being “on” for three or four hours (you decide) and
then “off” to get some rest down below in a bunk.
Safety harnesses
A safety harness works like an extra hand to help keep you on board as you
move around the deck on bigger keelboats. Wearing a safety harness leaves
your hands free for handling sheets, lines, and so on.
Never use a safety harness on a dinghy, which can capsize. Safety harnesses
are only for keelboats.
Pick a safety harness that fits snugly and is the proper size (they’re often
rated by body weight). The harness attaches to a tether that clips onto any
solid object, including jack lines. Jack lines are ropes, webbing, or cables that
run along the deck on either side of the cabin the length of the boat, specifi-
cally for use with safety harnesses (see Figure 14-2). Never attach a harness
to a lifeline; lifelines put you closer to the edge of the boat and can break. Rig
a jack line so that you can clip your safety harness onto it before you leave
the cockpit and never have to unclip it as you move around on deck.
Wear a harness during the following times:
 Any time a man-overboard rescue would be difficult
 When on deck alone
 When sailing at night — especially if you leave the cockpit
 When sailing in rough conditions
296
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Safety harnesses can be great for kids; for more, see Chapter 16.
Heaving-to and running before it
If you’re ever in really heavy weather — like when the wind is blowing the dogs
off their leashes — you may need to use an extreme technique for survival.
Heaving-to is a technique for extreme conditions that also works (on boats with
jibs) any time you want to “park” your boat, even in light air, as Figure 14-3
shows. It involves backing your jib (filling it backwards with wind) while filling
your main partially on a close-hauled or close-reaching course. If conditions
aren’t too windy, the boat stays balanced, moving forward and to leeward very
slowly. You can get into the heaved-to position by sailing along close-hauled
and tacking over while keeping the jib cleated. Then adjust the mainsail until
the boat “feels” comfortable. Heaving-to is a great way to take a break.
Look at the jib while you heave-to, and if it seems impaled on the windward
spreader (the strut that holds the shrouds away from the mast), ease the
sheet some to keep the sail from ripping, or you’ll have to cancel your lunch
break.

Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)

Running before it is a heavy-weather tactic for when it’s too windy to sail in
any direction, upwind or downwind, without getting into trouble. This tech-
nique entails slowing the boat down until it has minimal headway (just
enough to keep steerageway). In really strong winds, this means taking all
your sails down and even dragging ropes or any sort of object that slows the
boat down enough to be safe.
Avoiding thunder and lightning
In the Midwest and on the East Coast, the summer sailing season coincides
with thunderstorm season. Sudden summer storms bring strong winds and
lightning — a huge danger for sailors, because that aluminum mast on your
sailboat puts you at risk for getting hit by lightning. Check the weather fore-
cast before you go sailing (see Chapter 8). If you ever see a storm brewing or
see lightning, head for shore as soon as possible. If getting to shore isn’t fea-
sible, you can anchor your boat. Go in the cabin, stay low, and stay away
from any metal objects. Turn off the VHF radio and other electronics while
the lightning is close.
When my five-woman team was preparing for the start of the J-24 World
Championships on Lake Ontario and a big storm hit, we anchored the boat.
One crew member suggested attaching the spinnaker pole to the wire shroud
and letting the other end dangle in the water. She felt that the pole would
help dissipate the electrical current if we did get hit by lightning. Luckily we
didn’t get hit, so I’d probably try that again if caught in a similar situation.

Breaking the Mast
Breaking a mast is a real drag. Not only does a broken mast mean that you (or
your insurance company) are out a good chunk of change, but it can be dan-
gerous, especially in strong winds and big seas. Clearly, the best cure is an
ounce of prevention. We cover the basics of spar care and maintenance in
Chapter 15, but even with the best care, seemingly perfect fittings can fail for
no apparent reason. When this happens, the next thing you know — bang —
a gravity storm. Another cause for a dismasting is a violent capsize and subse-
quent turtling (a capsized position when the mast points straight down) in
shallow water.
To avoid breaking the mast, keep out of shallow water when sailing dinghies
in strong winds.
Every dismasting is a little different. Masts can break at a fitting or at some
other weak point. The broken mast may fall in the water, or it may dangle
from the remaining stump. On a dinghy, you may be able to pick up and
secure the broken pieces with one hand, whereas even lifting the standing
rigging is a task for more than one person on a 40-foot (12-meter) keelboat.
Therefore, no one “right way” exists to deal with a broken mast. You must use
your common sense and creativity to solve the unique problem it creates.
That said, here are some general rules to keep in mind:
 Save the crew and the boat first. If the process of retrieving and secur-
ing the broken pieces of the mast is endangering the safety of the crew
or the boat, cut it away as fast as you can.
 Don’t run the engine while rigging and stuff are in the water. See the
“Fouling the Prop” section, earlier in this chapter, if you don’t believe us.
 Be conscious of the loads. Consider the direction of forces on things. As
you clean up the broken gear, you’re like a lumberjack cutting a tree; cut-
ting one thing may have a domino effect on other things.
 Get the boat downwind of the mess. If the mast falls into the water, try to
maneuver the boat so that the mast is upwind. That way, the waves don’t
drive the hull onto the mast. Fortunately, Mother Nature should be on your
side, because the mast and sails want to drag upwind like a sea anchor.
 Recover all the wreckage, if you can. If you’re way out to sea, you may
find that those pieces of mast, sails, and rigging come in handy in jury-
rigging a new sail so you can get home.
If you must jettison the broken pieces for safety, being able to do so quickly is
nice. Sharp hacksaw blades (several) and heavy-duty wire cutters are invalu-
able tools. Often, the easiest way of freeing the rigging is by removing the

Halting Hull Damage
Serious hull damage below the waterline can be a major problem. It can
happen when you run aground, especially in rocks or coral, or if you run into
a solid object floating just under the water’s surface. Fortunately, this misfor-
tune taken to its extreme is rare, but minor or medium-size leaks caused by a
keel jarred loose in a grounding or a collision are more common. Here are
some ways to stave the flow and save your boat:
 Plug the hole with any available material. Clothing or cushions can
work well, and so can a life raft or a rubber dinghy. You can use a paddle
or convenient brace to secure the plug, as Figure 14-4 shows. You can
use a sail as an external bandage, and we’re sure you aren’t surprised to
hear that we’ve used duct tape to plug holes.
 Use heeling to your advantage. This situation is one time when more
heel can be good. If the hole is near the waterline along the side of the
boat, you may be able to sail the boat on a particular point of sail (using
the reverse of all the tips to limit heel, which we discuss in Chapters 11
and 12) so that the hole comes partially or completely out of the water.
This direction may not get you to safety, but at least this tactic gives you
time to repair the damage.
 Get out the pumps. If leaking water is a problem, everybody should be
bailing. Buckets work great.

Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 
The race isn’t over until . . .
In a famous incident in the Transpac Race (from
Los Angeles to Honolulu), the 70-foot Cheval
was 25 miles from the finish and in first place
with a nice lead when the unthinkable occurred:
The mast broke during a jibe.
As the disheartened crew rushed to clean up
the mess before the boat blew onto the reef, the
owner climbed on deck after doing some cal-
culations at the chart table. “Hey guys,” he said,
“we can still win this race — all we have to do
is average six knots the rest of the way!”
Rekindled with enthusiasm, the crew cut away
the broken pieces and began jury-rigging hal-
yards to the 15-foot mast stump sticking out of
the deck. Soon they had a small sail hoisted and
were doing five knots — hardly the 20 knots or
better the boat was capable of doing in the con-
ditions, but movement, at least.
After some more macramé and creative use of
spinnaker poles and booms, the crew had man-
aged to set another, bigger sail sideways. The
crew added more “canvas” as the boat began
surfing the swells in the Molokai Channel.
Cheval did win that race, and this story is a
great example of how human creativity (and
probably a fair amount of duct tape) can solve
most any problem.

 Radio for help. For information on using your VHF radio, see Chapter 7.
To get the attention (and assistance) of nearby boats, use the basic dis-
tress signal — stand and wave your arms.
 Get to safety as soon as possible. This may mean sailing to a different
port than the one from which you started. In an extreme case in which
the boat is truly sinking, you may have to intentionally ground the boat
(or beach your dinghy). If you must use this tactic, pick a spot that’s as
sheltered (especially from waves) as possible and has a nice, soft sand
or mud bottom.
Abandoning Ship
Between the two of us, we’ve been on boats that have run aground, blown
out sails, been towed to safety, fouled a prop, been holed, been dismasted,
and sunk (in shallow water — Peter’s cellphone was the only casualty). But
neither of us has ever had to activate an EPIRB or abandon ship into a life
raft. Hopefully, you can say the same thing after thousands of miles have
passed under your keel. But, remembering the Boy Scouts’ line, it doesn’t
hurt to be prepared.
EPIRB stands for Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon. Marine stores
sell these incredible devices, which are directly responsible for saving hun-
dreds of sailors’ lives. When activated in an emergency, an EPIRB emits a dis-
tress signal on a frequency that’s monitored by satellites and airplanes —
which makes finding you much easier for rescuers! Check with your marine
store to see whether you need to register your EPIRB.

Chapter 14: Encountering Sailing Emergencies (And How to Handle Them)

You can’t abandon ship into a life raft if you don’t have one. They’re big and
bulky, but carrying one when sailing significant distances out of sight of land
is wise. Obviously, we’re talking about keelboats; no one should sail a dinghy
out of sight of land. Make sure the raft is rated for the number of people you
have on board and has been recently inspected. If not, or if you’re unsure,
check with your local marine store to find a company that specializes in
inspecting and “refreshing” your life raft.
An old adage says, “Don’t abandon ship into a life raft until you have to step
up to get into the raft.”
This saying highlights an important fact. The situation has to be pretty darn
desperate before you exchange your big sailboat for a glorified air mattress
with K rations. Don’t take this the wrong way — we believe in life rafts; the
modern ones are marvelous pieces of technology. But still, things have to be
pretty bad before you’re safer in a life raft than aboard your boat.
A modern life raft is packed into a hard plastic case and is very heavy to lift.
Therefore, you want to be sure that the raft is up on deck in a very accessible
spot (and tied down securely) if abandoning ship is in the cards. Peter did
inflate and get inside a life raft once, for a TV show, and he remembers a few
things about that experience worth relating:
 You can find a cartoon-style description of how to deploy and inflate the
life raft on a life raft’s case.
 Tie the life raft’s bow line (which is apparent outside the case) securely
to the boat before throwing the raft into the water and inflating.
 The K rations taste kind of like vanilla wafer cookies — and the water
comes in cans.
For a great true story about this subject, check out Steve Callahan’s best
seller, Adrift.

Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 
Abandoning ship means abandoning your claim
Don’t give away your boat! The law of the sea
says that if someone finds an abandoned boat
drifting along and tows it home (“salvages” it),
it’s his! So don’t abandon ship. If you must leave
your boat, leave a note saying that you intend to
return. Even if you’re aboard and in need of help,
you don’t want to risk any outrageous salvage
claim, so clearly establish the terms of the
helper’s aid before you get too far along in the
rescue process. Also, it looks better in the eyes
of the law if you pass your rescuer a line (indi-
cating a voluntary acceptance of aid) rather
than having your rescuer pass a line to you.

Fighting Fire
Fire is one of the most serious dangers a sailor can face. Fire can occur by
any number of means, but most start in the galley (kitchen), around the
engine, or in the electrical system. Needless to say, put out fires immediately.
The U.S. Coast Guard requires that all boats with motors carry fire extin-
guishers (except boats shorter than 26 feet, or 8 meters, with outboard
engines, as long as that boat doesn’t have permanently installed fuel tanks or
spaces where fumes can collect and isn’t carrying passengers for hire). With
all fire extinguishers, having the right type for each fire, keeping them in good
working order, and storing them in a convenient spot are imperative.
Table 14-1 can help you sort out the USCG regulations regarding fire 
extinguishers.

Fire extinguishers are rated by both the types of fires they extinguish and the
amount of extinguishing material. A letter, A, B, or C, indicates the type of
fire, while the fire volume is a number. A is for alcohol and wood, B for gaso-
line and grease, and C for electrical. For example, a B-II has twice as much
chemical as a B-I. Purchase fire extinguishers for your boat at your local
marine store and buy enough extinguishers to fulfill Coast Guard regulations,
but then consider the special needs of your boat. If you have electronics on
board, you may want a Halotron 1 extinguisher nearby or the new Aqueous
foam extinguishers.
Depending on the type of fire, your best strategy and equipment for extin-
guishing the fire varies. Table 14-2 covers the action to take for the most
common types of fires on board. Remember to aim at the base of the fire, and
shoot the spray in a sweeping motion.

Caring for Your Craft
In This Chapter
 Maintaining your boat, all its parts, and the sails
 Checking the engine
 Storing your boat
Mothlike in mists, scintillant in the minute brilliance of cloudless days, with
broad bellying sails.
They glide to the wind tossing green water from their sharp prows while
over them the crew crawls.
— William Carlos Williams
I
n the grand old days of Admiral Horatio Nelson’s British Navy, the crew of
a square rigger would holystone, or scrub, the decks every day at dawn in
all but the most extreme conditions. Unused sails had to be furled with a 
military precision rivaling the beds of today’s U.S. Marines. This tradition of
keeping your boat looking good, with everything in its proper place and
stored absolutely correctly, is still in place today. Part of the tradition is
simply good seamanship, and part is pride of ownership. Your boat and your
sails are a reflection on you — and you don’t walk around town with seagull
poop on your head, do you?
Regular inspection of your boat for wear and tear helps avoid problems on
the water. Many parts of the boat show signs of rust or stress cracks prior to
breaking. The key is knowing where to look to find signs of a worn-out part —
and remembering to look. In this chapter, we start by looking at the areas
requiring the most regular maintenance and replacement (the ropes, rigging,
and sails) and then cover the mast, hull, and engine (if you have one).
Forty years ago, this subject of maintenance was a much bigger part of boat
ownership, but as builders have shifted from wood to fiberglass, maintenance
has become much easier. For those who prefer to leave the grunt work to
others, you can choose from a virtual plethora of boatyard and marine-
maintenance professionals. Plus, you can rent boats from charter companies

and sailing clubs and avoid any maintenance work. (Check out Chapter 17 for
more on chartering and Chapter 2 for more on finding sailing clubs.)
Doing basic maintenance on our own boat is fun, and we hope that this chap-
ter makes you feel the same way. When it comes to the major repairs, how-
ever, we usually turn to the pros, not because we can’t do the job, but
because that kind of project takes forever and never seems to come out as
nice when we do it ourselves.
Rapping about Running Rigging
Running rigging, as we cover in Chapter 1, is all the control lines (ropes) and
gear you use to adjust the sails and includes the sheets and halyards. Because
running rigging gets a real workout every time you sail, you need to keep it in
top condition — you can’t sail a sailboat with a broken mainsheet.
In this section, we first talk about something every boat has plenty of —
rope. We then focus on the blocks, winches, and cleats that help you work
with those ropes and how to keep them functioning effectively.
A few lines about line
Line is “rope with a purpose.” Because most of the millions of ropes on a sail-
boat have some use, they’re usually called lines, although in this book we
both use the word rope often and interchangeably — with no ill effect! When
selecting or replacing a line, consider the following characteristics in deter-
mining what’s appropriate for the task at hand:
 Strength: All lines used as running rigging should be made of some sort
of synthetic material because of its superior performance. Most of the
rope we use on racing boats has a space-age Vectran, Spectra, or Kevlar
core — very light and incredibly strong.
Different sailing parts have different strength needs, depending on their
application. A jib sheet must be stronger than a mainsail cunningham.
An anchor or tow line should be strong but very stretchy. Your man-
overboard retrieval line should float, as we discuss in Chapter 7. A dock
line should be strong and very resistant to chafe. Some storage applica-
tions may call for incredibly stretchy rubber-filled rope called bungee
cord or shock cord.
 Diameter: A line increases in strength with its diameter. Some high-tech
fibers are stronger than the same diameter of wire. Comfort is most
important in a line that you hold onto constantly — that’s why you want
a relatively thick, fuzzy mainsheet. If a line must pass through several
pulleys and is usually kept cleated (like a block-and-tackle backstay
306
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

adjuster), you should opt for thinner line for less friction (and smaller,
less expensive blocks).
 Color: If every rope on the boat is white, life gets pretty confusing (not
to mention boring).
.
 Cost: Check out the rope department in your local marine store (most
hardware stores don’t stock good sailing rope), and you see why so
many boats have white polyester line — all those fancy colors and high-
tech materials are expensive!
 Feel: A rope that’s softer and smoother is easier to hold — but more
expensive (and you may wear gloves anyway).
Comparing laid and braided rope
Rope that has three visible, primary strands twisted in a spiral is called laid
rope. Laid rope, which is usually less expensive than its braided cousin, is
common in dock lines and tow lines. However, for the running rigging in your
boat, braided rope is far superior. As the name implies, braided rope looks
like the tiny fibers are braided together. Braided rope often has an inner core
(where those space-age fibers can be used) that carries most of the load. You
can see laid and braided rope in Figure 15-1.
Using splices
In Chapter 19, we show how to put a loop in a line by tying a bowline knot.
Another, much more permanent way to make a rope loop is an eye splice. 
Eye splices are neater, less bulky than knots, and are commonly found at the
working end of a halyard (where the rope attaches to a shackle) and at the
end of an anchor line. They’re time consuming for a beginner to create, but a
professional rigger can whip one up in less than five minutes (but probably
charges for an hour!). If the splice will have a major load (like an anchor line),
Figure 15-1:

(left) and
braided line
(with core,

component
parts
exposed.
307
Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

you must insert a thimble (metal or plastic teardrop-shaped fitting) into the
loop to distribute the load and prevent chafe. Figure 15-2 shows an eye splice
at the end of a braided line halyard attached to a snap shackle (on the left)
and an eye splice at the end of a laid-line anchor rope with a thimble inserted
to prevent chafe (on the right).
Your local marine store should have a book about knots and splices. (In it
you discover that more types of both exist than you can ever imagine!)
Going to the bitter end
No matter what kind of rope you use, the very end of it can be a problem 
area if it starts to fray — because the usable part of the line gets shorter and
shorter. The easiest solution for most ropes is simply to melt the end with a
butane lighter, some matches, or a special hot knife (commonly found in the
rope department of a marine store). With braided rope, sometimes the inner
core won’t burn. So pull out and cut off a few inches of the inner core. Then
slide the cover over and melt the end of the cover, as the right photo of
Figure 15-3 shows.
If burning doesn’t work, you can always tie an overhand knot in the end (a
temporary fix), wrap tape around it, or whip it. Whipping, the old-fashioned
way to secure a splice or the end of a rope, requires the use of a special sail-
maker’s needle and strong synthetic thread. Wrap the thread tightly around
the rope to hold it together, and then stitch the thread securely through the
rope so that it doesn’t unravel during use, as the left photo of Figure 15-3
shows. Melting the rope’s end “outside” the whipping is still a good idea.
Caring for your lines
When not using a line, securely coil and store it. (We discuss how to coil a line
in Chapter 4.) If you sail in saltwater, flush the wet lines with freshwater after
sailing. Hang wet line where it can dry and try to store it (whenever practical)
out of the incredibly damaging rays of the sun. Check them periodically for
wear, especially where they commonly load up on a pulley or other corner. To
extend the life of your lines, consider switching your halyards and sheets end
for end occasionally — sort of the yachting equivalent of rotating your tires.

Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Sailing gear
This section focuses on the fittings that help your lines do their work — the
winches, blocks, shackles, and cleats. Remember that a key part of caring for
this gear is visual maintenance — looking for hairline cracks in metal parts,
signs of corrosion, or other indications that something isn’t quite right.
Blocks
Your boat has many blocks or pulleys; they’re probably hanging from the
boom, bolted to the deck, and built into your mast (see Chapter 4). Blocks
come in all different sizes and shapes and must be matched to the task at
hand, or they may cause problems. The key considerations include
 Strength: The manufacturer provides information on the working load.
Usually (but not always), the bigger the block, the stronger it is. The size
of the metal or fiber strap or shackle used to attach the block to the
boat indicates the block’s strength. A block that’s too weak starts to
deform. Often, a sticky sheave (the moving wheel-shaped part that the
rope turns over) is the first sign of problems.
 Proper use: Some blocks are designed specifically for wire; they often have
metal sheaves. If you put wire on a block intended for rope, the sheave can
crack or chafe and develop a groove in it. Also, don’t use too thick a rope in
a block. Err on using too small a rope diameter, and you have less friction.
Most sailing blocks are very low maintenance. Rinse any block with freshwa-
ter after a day of sailing in saltwater, and all blocks appreciate being stored
out of those ultraviolet rays. Some blocks require occasional lubrication; how-
ever, check with the manufacturer’s directions first, because the lubricant may
gum up the works. Often, the way the block is attached to the boat — by its
shackle — is the weak link.

Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

Shackles
Shackles (the metal fittings used for attaching different parts of the boat,
mast, and sails) are everywhere on your boat, just like blocks. Your boat may
have twist shackles, snap shackles, brummel hooks, and/or captive pin
shackles, to name a few. Keep the following considerations in mind when
picking out, installing, and maintaining shackles:
 Strength: The shackle’s manufacturer specifies the safe working load;
however, you can get a good idea of its strength by looking at the diame-
ter of the metal.
 Accessibility: A snap shackle is the easiest type of shackle to open, but it
can be large and expensive. The D-shaped shackle is by far the most
common, but it’s more difficult to open in a hurry.
 Security: Shackles, especially the ones attached to the corners of the
sails, can really get flapped about when the sails are luffing. Wrapping
plastic tape around a snap shackle keeps it from opening accidentally. D-
shaped shackles are often secured by a screw pin; tighten the pin
securely with a wrench. As with any nut and bolt, be careful not to cross-
thread these shackles.
D-shaped shackles and other fittings can have a clevis pin with a cotter
pin or ring ding securing it, as Figure 15-4 shows. Ring dings are easier to
put on and take off, but you must tape them so that they don’t catch
something and open up. Cotter pins shouldn’t be too long and should be
spread open, with the ends bent out just enough to facilitate removing
the pins in an emergency, and taped, because their points are very sharp.

Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Winches
In Chapters 4 and 5, we discuss winches and the techniques for using them.
Because of their many moving parts, they need more attention than pulleys.
The manufacturer’s literature or the folks at the local marine store can help
you pick out a winch (although most keelboats already have plenty) and
maintenance supplies. In the following list, we provide the keys to maintain-
ing your winches:
 Clean your winch: Take the winch totally apart at least once a year
(doing so is sort of like playing with an erector set — just don’t forget
where each piece goes!) and clean all the internal metal parts. A big
bucket with an inch or so of gasoline or paint thinner in it and a tooth-
brush make a great washtub and scrubber. Lay out a huge drop cloth
and have plenty of rags for this very messy job.
 Keep your winch salt free: Flush it with freshwater after use and make
sure that all the drain holes around its base are open so that any rainwa-
ter can escape.
 Lubricate your winch: Check for any special instructions from the man-
ufacturer. After taking the drum off and setting it aside, inspect and
lubricate all the moving parts and bearing surfaces. Pay special atten-
tion to the pawls, which allow the winch to spin one way and not the
other, shown in Figure 15-5. The pawls should swing easily with the
touch of a finger, with the spring providing sufficient power to return the
pawl to the “open” position. If they don’t move freely after cleaning and
a lube, replace both spring and pawl. Inspect and lubricate your winches
at least twice a year (and more if you use the boat frequently).
Pawl

311
Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

Don’t forget — regular visual inspection is important. When sailing, pay atten-
tion to how well the winch works, and be especially concerned about any jerk-
ing under load or weird noises. Also, when you have the winch apart for lubri-
cation, take a close look at all the internal parts for wear or signs of fatigue.
Inspecting the Mast
A mast is supported by wires called, as a group, the standing rigging, which
we introduce in Chapter 1. And in Chapter 14, we discuss the potential haz-
ardous consequences of one of a sailor’s biggest nightmares — a dismasting.
First make sure that your mast is straight (or in column) by sighting up the
mast from the bottom. On a boat with shrouds, you can adjust the turnbuck-
les (devices used to adjust shroud tension) to get the mast straight. This
“tuning,” or getting the mast in column while at the dock, is pretty easy. But
you should also sight up the mast when sailing upwind in moderate winds
and make further adjustments as needed. If you’re having trouble, ask a local
rigger to help.
Depending on your use of the boat, you may have to inspect your mast and
components twice a year, every month, or even more often — especially after
sailing in heavy weather, when things get stressed to the maximum. On a
dinghy or small boat, you can take the mast down to inspect it. For a larger
boat, you have to send someone up the mast.
To hoist someone up the mast, you need a bosun’s chair — a harness-type
device that provides a “seat” and can be attached to the halyard, as Figure
15-6 shows. A winch will be necessary if the person going up is heavy. Never
trust your safety to a halyard shackle; always tie the halyard rope with a bow-
line to the bosun’s chair. The person going aloft should be ready for a wild
ride if you’re under way, especially if you’re in the midst of waves, because
the motion of the ocean is accentuated at the top of the mast. Always ensure
that any tools or hard objects (which can put a major dent in the deck if they
fall) are secure when going aloft. For that same reason, never stand beneath
anyone who’s working up in the rig.
Whenever possible when going aloft, use a second halyard as a backup. You
don’t want to find out about a worn halyard when you’re up the mast!
Examine the following areas for signs of stress or damage:
312
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Mast section: Dents and cracks are bad — so are missing rivets.
 Sheaves: Every halyard has a sheave that you need to examine and pos-
sibly lubricate.
 Spreaders: Try moving the spreaders by shaking them at the end.
Movement is bad, unless they’re clearly designed to move laterally (fore
and aft at the tip). Look for fatigue at the inside end and check the
attachment to the shrouds.
 Standing rigging: The ends of the standing rigging, where they’re termi-
nated into some sort of fitting for attachment, are the first places to
look. Check carefully, because a broken stay is a sure way to lose a mast.
As with all metal fittings, look for cracks, signs of deformation, and 
corrosion.
 Tangs: Tangs are the attachment points for the standing rigging.
 Turnbuckles: Some turnbuckles — which are adjustment devices used
primarily to tighten rods — are on deck; some may be aloft. You should
lubricate turnbuckles when they’re tuned under load.
 Water pockets: Anywhere that water can sit is a prime location for cor-
rosion. Look under taped fittings and anywhere else water may pool.

Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

Maintaining Your Sails
Sails are your boat’s engine, so keep them “well oiled” and in tune. With proper
care, your sails will last longer and retain their designed shape when flying in
the wind. In this section, we focus on how to fold, store, and care for your sails.
Folding sails
After using your sail, put it away in a manner that’s easy on both the sail and
you. Some racers roll their sails (from top to bottom) after a day on the
water. Rolling may be easier on the sailcloth, but doing so is a cumbersome
task. An easier way is folding the sail.
You can easily roll sails that are fully battened, like most catamaran main-
sails, because the battens provide support, like a venetian blind. Rolling
these sails is preferable to taking out all the battens and then folding the sail.
You can fold sails from bottom to top with creases horizontal to the foot, like
an accordion. Mainsails on larger keelboats can be flaked in this manner right
on top of the boom for easy storage, as Figure 15-7 shows.
Follow these easy steps to fold your sails:
1. Pick your spot and stretch the sail out to its full size (if possible).
Find a spot that’s at least as long and wide as a single fold on which to
fold the sail. Grass lawns make great sail folding surfaces; parking lots
are bad because they’re rough and dirty.
Figure 15-7:

or sail ties.
314
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

2. Remove the battens from their pockets on the sail.
Except for the very short, permanently installed battens sewn onto the
leeches of some jibs, remove all the battens so that you can fold the sail
into a smaller bundle.
3. Stretch the foot out and, with one person at the tack and one at the
clew, begin folding the sail like an accordion, starting at the bottom,
as Figure 15-8 shows.
Pull against each other just enough to define the crease of the next fold.
4. Work to the top.
Each fold should be approximately the same width — about 1 foot (30
centimeters) wide for a dinghy sail and 3 feet (1 meter) or more for a 50-
foot (15-meter) keelboat sail.
5. Roll up the sail and bag it.
When you reach the head of the sail, begin rolling or folding the sail
lengthwise into a shape that fits in the sail bag.
Storing sails
Here are some tips to consider when you’re putting sails away after a day on
the water:
 Keep all the pieces together. If battens or other fittings come with the
sail, store them with the sail in its bag.
 Keep your sails out of the sun. The sun’s ultraviolet light degrades sail-
cloth and the stitching that holds the seams together. Therefore, cover the
sails or store them away from the sun’s rays while you aren’t using them.
Figure 15-8:

a sail —

315
Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

 Minimize the creases. If you don’t have to roll them up into a tiny
bundle, don’t. Try not to crease any plastic windows.
 Store your sails dry. If you’re going to sail again tomorrow, you don’t
have to dry your wet sails, but if you plan to store your sails for longer
than a few days, make sure that they’re dry. A lawn or the deck of your
boat can be a good spot for spreading the sails out to dry. If you’re stor-
ing them for the winter, take the extra effort to rinse the salt off, too.
Caring for your sails
Most sails suffer their worst damage when they’re hoisted under sail. You can
take a few measures to protect your sails and to keep them looking good and
holding together longer:
 Don’t let them flap too much. Luffing degrades sails faster than the sun.
In the America’s Cup, crews actually keep track of the number of times a
sail is tacked because it flaps when it tacks, shortening the sail’s com-
petitive life. Never leave your sails luffing at anchor or at the dock.
 Don’t sail without battens. Without their support, the sail becomes
overloaded in the region around the missing batten.
 Don’t use sails in too much wind. Some sails, especially spinnakers, are
made out of lightweight cloth that can blow out in strong winds.
 Inspect the seams, batten pockets, bolt rope or slugs, and corners for
wear and tear. Sails usually rip in these places. If they look question-
able, take them to a sailmaker, drag out your needle and thread, or slap
on some of that sticky-back tape we discuss in Chapter 14.
 Protect sails from chafe. Common chafe locations occur where the sails
hit the spreader and the lifelines during tacks. A layer of sticky-back
applied over the at-risk location provides sufficient protection.
When your sails do get a rip or a hole, have a sailmaker fix it. However, you
can always refer to Chapter 14 if you’re underway or in a “do-it-yourself”
frame of mind.
Caring for the Hull
As you hose off your boat and fittings after sailing (an important part of boat
maintenance if your boat sails in saltwater), take a good look at some of the
high-load areas where serious structural problems may be apparent. Keep
your eye open for cracks or signs of water leakage that indicate weak areas.
Sometimes, supposedly “stainless-steel” fasteners attached to the hull begin
316
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

to show signs of rust. If possible, apply a light amount of force and “shake”
any attached fittings to see whether they’re still secure.
The following list includes some parts of the hull and deck above the water
line that come under high loads and that you should inspect after each sail:
 Chain plates (metal fittings to which the shrouds, forestay, and backstay
are attached)
 Jib tracks
 Main traveler and mainsheet
 Mast step and partners (the point where the mast leaves the deck)
 Attachment point of other fittings
If your boat is stored in saltwater, its metal parts can turn it into a big battery.
If left undeterred, this chemical reaction can result in serious corrosion. To
fend off the highly corrosive effect of saltwater on metal, you must provide
the saltwater with something even more “edible.” If your boat has an inboard
engine, you should have a zinc fitting attached to the propeller shaft. When
dockside, you can also hang a plate of zinc (attached by a battery-type cable to
the chainplates) overboard. Your local marine store has these zincs in stock.
Looking Under Your Boat
If your sailboat is a dinghy, you may be able to flip it upside down on shore
easily to look at and work on the underside of the hull. You can most easily
inspect keelboats on a trailer or other support on dry land — or you can
always don a mask and snorkel. The same principles and guidelines apply
under the waterline as above the waterline. Pay attention to the following
high-load areas:
 The attachment point of your foils (keel/centerboard and rudder):
Look for small, horizontal cracks that can develop where the lead keel
meets the hull or keel stub, or rust stains around the keel bolts. Ask a
professional to look at any problem areas.
 The steering system: Check the rudder and its attachment points for
signs of wear and tear. If you have a wheel, check the quadrant (bracket
around the rudder post that connects to the steering cables) and steer-
ing cables.
 The propeller shaft: If you have an inboard engine, inspect the propeller
shaft and its support structure.
Most dinghies and keelboats that are drysailed (stored out of the water when
not sailing) are happy with their original gel-coat bottom. If your boat lives in
317
Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

the water, it probably already has anti-fouling bottom paint on it. This stuff
inhibits the growth of barnacles and slimy grass. If you’re considering a new
coat of anti-fouling bottom paint, check with a local boatyard to find out
about any restrictions in your waters. Certain types of these toxic paints are
restricted, especially in clean freshwater lakes.
When selecting a bottom paint, consider the manufacturer’s information.
Certain types of paints work better for different situations. We like to refer to
Practical Sailor (www.practical-sailor.com) for advice on the best mate-
rials to use. Another great magazine for the “do-it-yourselfer” is BoatWorks,
from the editors of Sail magazine (www.boatworksmagazine.com).
Most marinas have divers who scrub the bottom of your boat (and maintain
the zinc on the propeller shaft) each month for a reasonable fee (compared
to the hassle of donning that dive gear and doing it yourself). Keeping your
bottom clean is well worth the investment — a clean bottom is a fast bottom.
Keeping an Eye on the Engine
Hey, isn’t this book about sailing? Yes, but most larger (longer than 25 feet, or
8 meters) keelboats have a noisemaker that can come in handy when docking
in tight situations, in emergencies, and when, heaven forbid, the wind dies.
This section focuses on using and caring for your engine.
Using the engine
Before you do anything with your engine, make sure you read your owner’s
manual; it’s the best source of information on operation and maintenance.
You also want to remember the following general operating rules for all types
of engines:
 Don’t count on reverse: We discuss operating a boat under power in
docking situations in Chapter 6. Just remember that if you’re moving for-
ward at any significant speed, the reverse gear’s effect is laughable, so
don’t count on a blast of reverse to be able to stop the boat.
 Look for water: Most inboard engines have water-coolant and exhaust
exit holes or pipes visible from on deck, which are often in the transom.
When you start the engine, confirm that water is coming out (usually a
slow, pulsing flow) of the exhaust — this means the cooling system is
working properly.
 Slow down to shift: Hey, this isn’t a rental car. Idle the throttle down to a
bare minimum before shifting gears.
318
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Ventilate first: Explosive fumes from all sorts of sources can collect in
the bilge of your boat. Make sure that the area around the engine (which
can get hot and often has sparks involved) is ventilated before starting.
If the boat has a blower, a fan in the engine compartment, run it for at
least five minutes. Make sure that the cabin of the boat has been open for
a while and check below for any funny smells before starting the engine.
 Watch the temperature: A high temperature tells you that you have a
cooling-system problem (maybe a plastic bag sucked into the intake).
Avoid operating your engine at maximum throttle — doing so may cause
overheating. Watch the RPM meter if you have one, and keep the RPMs
at or below the engine’s safe operating limit. If your manual doesn’t tell
you this speed, check with a professional for advice.
Caring for the engine
Like with your car, you probably want to leave the major (and maybe even
the minor) stuff to a professional. Maintaining the engine in your boat is very
important. The saltwater environment, often less-than-pristine fuel sources,
and operation at various angles of heel can wreak havoc on the best power
plant. Here are some important points to remember:
 Change your oil. Check and change it regularly; oil is the lifeblood of
any engine.
 Check your filters. Along with having an adequate fuel filter, you should
have a water separator/sedimenter in the fuel line — check and clean it
regularly.
 Rinse out that salt. Saltwater corrodes metal. You can flush the cooling
systems of most outboard engines with freshwater by using a special set
of ears that attach to a hose. You should flush an outboard after every
use. Rinse off all the external parts of the engine with freshwater. For
inboard engines, see the section “Caring for the Hull,” earlier in this
chapter, about attaching zinc.
 Take along spares. If you plan on making a longer trip, make sure that you
have some common spare parts (such as drive belts) and know how to
install them. Ask your engine mechanic for a good list and instructions.
Leaving Your Boat
When the sailing is over and the time comes to go home, you want to make
sure that your boat is happy and safe while you’re away. This short section
looks at the short-term and long-term concerns you need to remember.
319
Chapter 15: Caring for Your Craft

Short-term
If you’ll be back to the boat in the next few days, or even within the month,
after sailing you want to put your boat away securely, but not so securely
that you need the whole weekend to prepare for your next sail. Here are some
tips to help make sure that your boat is ready to go again when you decide to
take it out for another spin:
 Minimize water collection: Dinghies can be stored upside down if you
take down the mast. If you leave the mast up, try to angle the dinghy so
that rainwater drains out quickly. Many dinghies have drain plugs on the
stern for this purpose. Most cockpits of keelboats drain automatically,
but make sure that all hatches and openings are well sealed. A cover
over the boom tied to the rails can also help keep the rain out.
 Make no dents, please: Be careful when storing your dinghy on land. 
If you store it with the mast up, make sure that the hull is supported 
in several locations, not a single point where the hull can depress and
weaken. If you store your dinghy upside down, consider where the deck
is strongest — often at the very bow, near the chain plates, and at the
transom.
 Protect your boat and its gear from the sun: Store as much stuff (rope,
blocks, sails, and so on) as practical out of those rays.
 Protect your gear from the wind: You know to tie down the hull, but
consider other things that can loosen up and blow on a windy day (such
as any sail, including a roller-furled jib and halyards, which can cause a
real racket).
 Secure the hull: If you store your boat on land, make sure that you tie it
down securely. If your boat lives afloat, check the dock or mooring lines.
In Chapters 6 and 10, we cover the best way to secure the boat.
 Turn off anything electrical other than an automatic bilge pump on
keelboats. You may also need to remove fuel tanks on boats with out-
boards and/or close fuel valves on any boat with an engine.
Long-term
Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, the sailing season isn’t year round.
If you’re going to leave your boat for longer than a month, consider these fur-
ther efforts to keep the boat happy:
 Covering: Whenever possible, cover your equipment to protect it from
rain, snow, sun, and dirt.
 Engine: Ask your mechanic what, if anything, you should do to your
engine, including winterizing to avoid ice forming in the engine block.
320
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Disconnect the battery terminals unless the boat is stored in the water
where an automatic bilge pump is necessary.
 Fluids: Drain water and gasoline tanks and top off diesel tanks.
 Haul out: Most large keelboats are hauled out at a boatyard, cleaned
(especially below the waterline), derigged, and covered with protective
tarps for the winter. Make sure that the boat is supported and secured
adequately.
 Lubrication: Consider lubricating all your moving fittings, including
parts of the mast, to protect them from inactivity.
 Mildew: If you live in a wet area and plan to store your boat under plas-
tic tarps, you’re going to have a mildew factory under there. Take home
for storage anything susceptible to damage. Some bigger keelboats even
have a dehumidifier rigged up to drain into the sink.
 Sails: If rolling your sails is ever worth the time and effort, this is the
time — if you have the space to store them. You may want your sail-
maker to check out your sails in the loft.

f you have a family and love to sail, here’s an important point: You get to
sail more frequently if your family also enjoys the sport. And sailing with
your family brings other benefits. Sailing for the day can bring your family
closer as you work together to keep the boat moving. On a weeklong cruise,
your kids may even discover that some of the “necessities” at home — such
as the TV and video games — are really luxuries that they can live without.
In this chapter, we look at how to enjoy a sailing trip with your children. We
focus mainly on making the most of an extended sailing trip on a bigger sail-
boat, but we also include information on planning a daytrip and on sailing
with children on smaller boats. Kids come in all sizes and shapes, but we
focus mainly on the younger, preteen years.

Preparing Your Family Crew
A big reason why our daughters feel comfortable on a boat is that we feel
comfortable having them on board. That comfort level is important. Children
are very sensitive to their parents’ emotions and can pick up on their fears. If
you’re afraid to have children on a boat, they’re afraid to be there. If you’re
nervous, try to assess why you’re concerned and then take concrete steps to
conquer those fears.
Probably every parent’s biggest fear on a boat is a child drowning. We can’t
say it often enough: One of the most important steps before taking your
family sailing is to make sure that everyone can swim. When children are con-
fident of their swimming abilities and are comfortable in the water, they seem
to pick up the basics of sailing much more easily because they’re more
relaxed and more likely to have fun.
When picking a swimming instructor, make sure he or she is properly trained
in the techniques and knows basic safety procedures. In the United States,
look for swimming instructors who have first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR), and Water Safety Instructor (WSI) certifications, which are avail-
able from the American Red Cross.
If you sail on the ocean, keep in mind that your children won’t enjoy swim-
ming in saltwater as much as swimming in a pool at first. Saltwater tastes
“funny,” stings the eyes, and often isn’t as warm as a pool; the waves are also
hard to handle.
Of course, nonswimmers can enjoy sailing, too. In fact, four-time America’s Cup
winner Dennis Conner can’t swim. Nonswimmers (and children) should always
wear a life jacket, even on larger boats (everyone should wear a life jacket on a
dinghy). Check out the section “Wearing the right life jackets and safety har-
nesses,” later in this chapter, as well as Chapter 3 for more information.
After your kids have mastered swimming class and enjoy the water, check out
sailing school options in Chapter 2. Most children grasp sailing very quickly
on small dinghies at camp, sailing schools, or with an older friend or relative
who sails.
Picking the Right Boat and Trip
While your crew is getting shipshape, you can think about what kind of boat to
ship them out on. The most important factor is the experience level of the adult.
324
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

We do not recommend that novice sailors ever take children sailing on boats
that they’re skippering. Novice sailors should try to go sailing with people
who have more experience than they do. For intermediate sailors, the most
important point is to pick a boat that they feel comfortable in — so that the
children feel comfortable and enjoy the experience.
This section provides you with some quick pointers about selecting the right
trip as well as the right boat for you depending on your ability level, your
crew’s comfort level, and the length of your trip.
Choosing a keelboat
Beginning sailors, young and old, usually feel more comfortable on a keelboat
than aboard a dinghy (see the next section for more on dinghies). A keelboat —
check out Chapter 1 — has a heavy, ballasted keel fin under the boat that pro-
vides stability and prevents capsizing. Large cruising multihulls (that gain
stability from having more than one hull) are also stable and comfortable.
Here are some other reasons why these bigger boats are the best choice for
families, whether your trip is going to last a week or just an afternoon:
 Keelboats often have cabins down below that are handy for taking naps,
storing snacks, and spreading out toys.
 Most keelboats have a deep cockpit, where kids can play safely and see
the sights without the risk of falling overboard. A boat longer than 25
feet (8 meters) probably has lifelines that provide extra security for the
very little ones.
325
Chapter 16: Cruising with Children
When is your child old enough to sail?
A child is never too young to enjoy a sailing trip
as long as you, your boat, and your crew are
prepared. We’ve been taking our daughters
sailing since before they were born. Every
summer we go to Catalina Island — 20 miles off
the coast of Los Angeles — on my parents’
boat. Games and books keep them occupied
while we’re under way, but their favorite time is
while we’re at anchor.
As toddlers, the girls saw boats as fun jungle
gyms, and spent hours turning the winches to
hear the sounds of the gears. Feeding bits of
bread to the fish (and smart seagulls) kept them
entertained as well. Their favorite stuffed ani-
mals are all sea creatures: Marly has a beloved
shark, and Megan has a family of seals that live
on her bed.

If you’re adamant about sailing with your kids, but you’ve only completed a
basic sailing course and have little other experience, then your best boat
choice is a small keelboat (18 to 25 feet)— but only day sailing in light and
moderate winds in protected waters.
Table 16-1 offers some general guidelines for the minimum age of children on
various types of boats, given the experience of the sailor.
Note: The table assumes light to moderate wind and sea conditions in 
protected waters. For the purposes of the table, a novice sailor has the equiv-
alent of one basic sailing course and little practical experience. An intermedi-
ate sailor has completed basic sailing training and has six months to two
years of practical experience. And advanced sailors have three or more years
of experience in a variety of wind conditions. An “X” indicates that we don’t
recommend that novice sailors take children of any age on these boats.

*For novice sailors, we recommend sailing with children on a small keelboat only if the children
are good swimmers and are comfortable in new situations.
Selecting a dinghy
Dinghies are usually smaller than keelboats (shorter than 20 feet, or 6 meters)
and have a lightweight, retractable fin instead of a heavy lead keel, and there-
fore are less stable and can flip over. In our experience, the scariest parts
about dinghy sailing for small children are the sudden changes in heel — the
tipping motion — and the fear of capsizing (tipping over). But if you’re taking
the kids out in a dinghy, here are tips to make the day a success, starting with
tips before you leave the shore:
326
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Make sure that the kids dress warmly. A waterproof jacket is nice so they
stay warm even if they get wet.
 Have a towel and change of clothes on shore so the kids can get dry and
comfortable as soon as you finish sailing.
 Before you leave the dock or beach, talk with your children about heel-
ing. Put them in the boat and show them how to move their weight to
counteract heel.
 Run through what to do with your children if the boat capsizes (see
Chapter 7). Go on the water and do a controlled capsize (where you 
pull the boat over) so that the kids can see how easy getting the boat
upright is.
 Make sure that you and your children are wearing life jackets.
 Be prepared to move your weight around often to minimize heeling
while sailing.
 Hold on tight to the little ones so that they feel secure.
 If possible, let your children sit in the center of the boat in a secure spot
where they can hold on.
 Be confident so that your children feel confident too.
Although dinghies offer the thrill of being close to the water, they have less
room, and often each crew member has a specific job. That makes caring for
the comfort, entertainment, and safety of a small child difficult, no matter
how good a sailor you are.
Practicing Safety on the Water
This section covers important safety matters, including childproofing your boat,
selecting the right life jackets and safety harnesses, keeping an eye on your chil-
dren, and knowing when your children earn the right to be unsupervised.
Childproofing your boat
Sailing safety begins before you get under way. Before your family steps onto
a cruising sailboat, keep these safety precautions in mind:
 Weave netting onto the lifelines. Netting, as Figure 16-1 shows, provides
a barrier between your younger child (and toys and pets) and the water.
Even with netting, never leave your child unsupervised on deck.
327
Chapter 16: Cruising with Children

 Don’t allow leaning over or through the lifelines. Netting or not.
 Rule out running. Especially while under way.
 Establish appropriate safety rules. (See the section “Keeping tabs on
the kids,” later in this chapter.)
 Ensure that any lifeline gates have clasps that little fingers can’t undo.
Securely close the gates as soon as you leave the dock.
 Look at where a child would land if he fell down the hatch. Do you
need to pad any sharp corners in the cabin?
 Put an awning over the cockpit while at anchor. Sunburn can ruin a
child’s (as well as everyone else’s) enjoyment of sailing. Awnings pro-
vide a shady, cool resting spot.
So after you childproof the boat for your children, your job’s over, right? You
know better than that. A parent’s job is never over, which is especially true
while sailing.
Wearing the right life jackets 
and safety harnesses
Do you let your small child go for a car ride without getting into a car seat?
Probably not. The same consistency can help you get your child to always
wear a life jacket on the water. See Chapter 3 for information regarding life jack-
ets. When purchasing a small child’s life jacket, look for the following specifics:
 A bright color for visibility. Reflective tape is great, too. You want to be
able to spot your child quickly if she falls in the water.
Figure 16-1:
Weave
netting onto
the lifelines
of your boat
if you have a
toddler
onboard.
328
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 A strap between the legs. This strap can keep the jacket from slipping off.
 A snug fit. The life jacket shouldn’t be so bulky that the child can’t put
both hands together in front (or else he won’t be able to hold on to the
lifelines and handrails properly).
If you’re still nervous about your child being near the water, even in a life
jacket, test the life jacket in the pool first.
Children’s life jackets have become so comfortable that we see lots of kids
riding their bikes home after sailing class with their life jackets still on. But
some families who live aboard a sailboat use safety harnesses (sometimes
instead of life jackets) for the kids. A safety harness provides security from
falling overboard and allows a child freedom to move around without the
bulk of the life jacket. Only used on keelboats, a safety harness should fit a
child snugly without falling off the shoulders, and for small children, should
have a strap between the legs. You can attach the tether in front or in back
and then you clip it onto a solid fitting in the center of the boat, as Figure 16-2
shows. Make sure that the tether is short enough that the child can’t reach
the water. (See Chapter 14 for more on harnesses.)
Keeping tabs on the kids
Watching your child play around a boat is like watching your child play near
a busy street — real danger lurks close by, and you must know where your
child is at every moment.
When our young children are on a boat, knowing that they can swim reas-
sures us because we know that they won’t panic if they fall in. We never leave
a younger child alone on deck for even a second.

329
Chapter 16: Cruising with Children

You can use the following safety rules and guidelines to get started when
cruising with kids:
 Allow children on deck only with an adult; make children have to tell the
adult when they’re going back down below.
 While sailing, don’t allow children to go on deck without an adult’s per-
mission or without their life jacket and/or safety harness.
 Know all the ways that children can get on deck — they may surprise
you by opening and climbing through the front hatch by themselves.
 Review with your kids the safety information in Chapter 7, especially the
information about where the safe areas are on deck.
 Know when you’re “on watch.” We always hand off the caretaker’s
responsibility verbally.
 Watch children just as carefully when you’re at the dock as when you’re
sailing.
Earning the right to go on their own
At some point, a child gains the maturity and the experience to be a valuable
member of the crew, and many of the rules in the preceding section are no
longer applicable. We don’t think this transformation occurs at a set age, but
we encourage you to keep this fact in mind: Giving your child more freedom
and authority on a boat (at the right time) is another great way to build her
confidence and love of sailing.
As a child, getting to go off in the rowboat by yourself or with your friends is
a big step. As a parent, watching your older child head off in the rowboat for
the first time is as nerve-wracking as letting your child ride his bike to a
friend’s house a few blocks away for the first time (even though the peace
and tranquility after he’s gone is well worth it). The key is to teach the kids
about safety and to set some guidelines.
Your older children need to master the following skills before heading off on
their own:
 Ability to handle the equipment: Children must know how to operate
and get a boat onto and off a beach safely and how to tie secure knots if
docking the boat.
 Emergency preparation: Practice a man-overboard drill, what to do if the
boat swamps, and how to propel the boat if your children lose one oar.
Review the appropriate safety information we cover in Chapters 7 and 14.
 Responsibility: Responsible behavior includes being careful with the
equipment and continuing to wear their life jackets even when they’re
out of sight.
330
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Knowledge of wind direction, tides, currents, and rocks in the area:
Rowing upwind or upcurrent can be exhausting or impossible. Before
they go, review Chapter 9 on navigation and look at a chart of the area
with your children.
Having a second rowing dinghy, kayak, or some other means of transporta-
tion while your children are gone is pretty nice for you and can be crucial for
safety (in other words, a rescue) if they don’t come back.
Essentially, you must make sure that your children feel comfortable and safe
in the boat. Then you can trust them while they’re off having fun — because,
as the Water Rat says in The Wind in the Willows, “There is nothing . . . half so
much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.”
Letting Children Help on the Boat
Even if your children have never had a sailing lesson, they can learn a great
deal from a day on the water, especially if you let them help with certain jobs.
Children can do almost anything on a boat with adult supervision, but certain
jobs, including the following, can always be in the kids’ domain:
 Making all the lines shipshape. Both of us spent hours as kids carefully
coiling all the ropes.
 Putting up the flag in the morning. And taking it down at night.
 Relaying commands when anchoring or mooring. With their help, no
one has to yell.
 Scrubbing the decks. Or else they can walk the plank!
 Stowing fenders. And putting dock lines away too.
 Tying knots. (Check out Chapter 19 for a quick overview of many knots.)
331
Chapter 16: Cruising with Children
School stuff afloat
Letting older children help study the chart, plot
the course, and dead reckon (all navigational
skills we cover in Chapter 9) can be a great way
to put your child’s math and geometry skills to
work while improving map-reading skills.
Celestial navigation is also a mind bender. But
even if you don’t own a sextant, being out on the
water is a great time to explore the joys of
astronomy. On a boat, you’re surrounded by
nature, both above and below the water; bring
some books along to make identifying your wild
companions easier.

Of course, the job your children want most of all is steering. Unlike handing
over the keys to the family wagon, steering a sailboat is a safe way for kids to
satisfy the “Dad, let me drive” urge. Letting your kids steer is also a great
chance to give them an introductory sailing lesson.
Enjoying a Longer Trip
Although keeping children happy on long-distance trips is quite possible,
you’re better off interspersing short sails with longer periods at anchor or
dockside at your destinations — unless you don’t mind being asked “When
are we going to get there?” a million times. Planning ahead can keep those
restless passengers entertained.
The most important item to bring is food. Nothing makes sailors grumpier than
running out of food, even on an afternoon sail. With all the new experiences
that your children have while sailing, they find eating their favorite foods at
mealtime comforting. And although getting back to nature and fishing for your
meals is great, assume when you’re packing that the fish won’t be biting.
332
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 
Rock-a-bye, baby
At anchor, letting a baby sleep on the floor, up
forward so that no one steps on him, is easier
than worrying about him falling (or climbing) 
out of a bunk. Figure out a safe place to leave 
a wakeful baby in case all hands are needed 
on deck.
For sleeping under way, make sure that the
bunks have leecloths — pieces of fabric that
create a soft “wall” on the “downhill” side of the
bunk, or a bunkboard — a removable wood slat
that serves as a wall to the bunk — so that a
sleeping body doesn’t roll out when the boat tips.
Keeping it clean
One of the great aspects of sailing is the way
you’re in tune with nature. Over the years, we’ve
watched certain bodies of water get cleaner,
while others seem to have more junk floating in
them every day. Because your children inherit
this Earth, set a good example both ashore and
afloat.
Keep the waters clean. If you live in the United
States, check the Coast Guard’s regulations on
dumping, which are quite strict if you sail close
to the shore. Never throw any garbage over-
board. Teach your children at an early age how
important clean water is to everyone!

In addition to everyone’s favorite food, this section has tips on how to sail
with a baby without filling an entire bunk with baby paraphernalia, as well as
what gear and books to bring to keep older kids happy on a longer trip.
Obviously, you have the best idea of what to bring to keep your kids happy,
but these suggestions can help.
Sailing with baby
On a longer sailing trip with a baby, using disposable diapers probably makes
sense, because cleaning cloth diapers can run through your water supply
very quickly. Disposables take up a great deal of space, though. You need to
pack plenty of plastic bags to keep those used diapers sealed well until you
can throw them into a trash can on shore.
You can leave the portable crib at home — it takes up too much space, and
the cockpit (with a canvas awning to protect baby from the sun) works great
as a playpen.
We use a bucket as a portable bathtub for babies while on board. And a sun-
shower (a black plastic bag filled with freshwater warmed by the sun) (check
out Figure 16-3) works well for keeping older kids clean (and adults, too).

Chapter 16: Cruising with Children

Packing the right gear
Even if you’re like JJ, and the thought of baiting a hook with a piece of squid
makes you gag, the kids may want to spend all day fishing, so don’t forget to
bring fishing poles and gear. The following are suggestions for other gear to
keep the kids entertained when you’re at anchor:
 Extra buckets for holding “beach finds”
 Snorkels, masks, and fins, as well as “viewfinders,” which are great for
watching the creatures on the bottom from a rowboat
Watch out for games and toys with small parts that you can lose on deck —
some games may have to remain below deck. Designate a certain area (an
out-of-the-way space like an aft cabin) to store toys, games, and invaluable
collections of shells and rocks.
Buckets are useful as baby washtubs and hermit crab houses, besides their
regular function for swabbing (cleaning) the decks. But be careful when trying
to fill a bucket by dunking it over the side while under way: The force of the
water can pull the bucket out of your hand — or pull a child overboard.
Books to bring for you and the kids
Children on a boat read more than they do at home (especially if you ditch
the portable video games). And they may surprise you by reading thicker and
older books than you expect. Many good books are available for younger kids
about sailing and sea life, including ones in the Magic Tree House and Magic
School Bus series. Here are some of our favorites, starting with books for the
youngest to the oldest kids:

So you think pregnancy rules out sailing? Not
so. In fact, I sailed in the United States, Japan,
and Spain while pregnant. A quick tip for preg-
nant sailors: Your center of gravity is higher than
usual — so be extra careful when you step into
a tippy dinghy (especially if you’re as big as I
was and can’t see your feet).
Also, even if you haven’t had any morning sick-
ness or don’t usually get seasick, the motion on
a sailboat may make you feel queasy during
pregnancy. Of course, pregnant women can’t
take seasickness medicine. I tried the acupres-
sure wrist bands, and they seemed to help me.
I also kept a supply of saltines, apples, and
ginger ale handy and always tried to keep a little
food in my stomach. For more tips on combating
seasickness, see Appendix B.

Spinnaker flying — nature’s roller coaster ride
When you and your family are seasoned sailors
(and have already mastered using the para-
chute-like spinnaker sail discussed in Chapter
12), a fun way to spend the afternoon while
anchored is to position the boat so that the kids
can go spinnaker flying, as shown in the follow-
ing figure. You need moderate winds and warm
water, and then follow these steps:
1. Anchor the boat in the wrong direction —
with the stern into the wind.
(See Chapter 10 on anchoring.)
2. Secure a bosun’s chair as a seat to slide
along a line attached to both lower corners
of the spinnaker.
(Check out Chapter 15 for what a bosun’s
chair looks like.)
3. Hook the top of the spinnaker to the hal-
yard.
4. Tie an extra-long safety retrieving line from
one clew (lower corner of the sail) to the
bow of your boat.
5. Have your friends or family members on
deck hoist the spinnaker about 3⁄4 of the
way — not all the way to the top.
Keep it from filling by having someone pull
on the retrieving line hard to keep the sail
luffing close to the water.
6. Jump in the water with a friend or family
member.
7. Climb into the chair and slide it along to the
center point of the rope between the two
corners.
8. Release the retrieving line, and have a
friend in the water help spread the corners
of the sail so that the wind catches it, and
off you go!
On a puffy day, spinnaker flying can make for a
wild ride!

 Understanding chartering
 Recognizing chartering skills
 Looking at popular cruising destinations
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a
damp, drizzly November in my soul . . . then, I account it high time to get
to sea as soon as I can. . . .
— Herman Melville, Moby Dick
I
magine spending a week’s vacation with your closest friends and family in
some of the most beautiful spots in the world. Thanks to sailboat charter
companies, you can take short vacation cruises in sailing paradises around
the world. You can sail in remote areas and spend a week without ever seeing
another soul, or you can cruise to hot spots in the Mediterranean and spend
your nights surrounded by the Cote d’Azur chic in a local nightclub.
In this chapter, we look at your options for chartering a boat and sailing
away. We also help you prepare for the business side of the charter. You need
to be able to sail to bareboat charter, and we review the skills you need.
Lastly, we look at the top cruising spots around the world. So what are you
waiting for? You don’t even have to own a boat!
Knowing What to Expect When 
You Charter a Boat
Thanks to excellent charter companies around the world, chartering a boat
doesn’t require as much planning as you may expect. Hey, you can go today —
just pick up the phone! The larger charter companies, such as Sunsail (www.
sunsail.com) or The Moorings (www.moorings.com), can help arrange

everything from air travel to hotel stays and side trips to provisioning. You
can even schedule a “cruise-and-learn” vacation to brush up on your sailing
skills during the whole trip or for just the first part of your trip. Some charter
companies also organize flotillas, where a lead boat with a professional cap-
tain and other staff provide support and organize excursions and parties.
The most common way to book your trip is directly with the charter com-
pany, but charter brokers can do the deal on your behalf. You can research
the various charter companies by scanning the advertising sections in the
back of some sailing magazines or going online.
A great magazine for charter aficionados is Cruising World. The magazine has
monthly features on different cruising locales as well as an annual readers’
survey of the best charter companies. Just to let you know how popular
cruising vacations are, more than 90 percent of the respondents to Cruising
World’s annual surveys feel that the cost was worth the experience and that
their sailing vacation went smoothly. We think that the other 10 percent prob-
ably never came back from the islands!
This section specifically details what you need to do and what you can
expect when chartering a sailboat. Follow our advice, and you should have a
memorable experience.
Going bareboat cruising
The most common way to charter is through a bareboat charter, in which
your group rents a bare boat from a charter company, fully rigged but with-
out any skipper or paid crew on board.
Planning the trip
If you want to have a successful bareboat cruise, look into the following when
you plan your vacation:
 The type of boat: Chartering enables you to try sailing different boats.
The bigger charter companies offer a variety of monohulls and catama-
rans from which to choose. As you see in Figure 17-1, a catamaran has
more space on deck (and that second hull for more space down below)
than a monohull of the same length. If having a specific boat is impor-
tant to you, make sure to get a commitment in writing from your charter
company. Ask about the contingency plan if the boat you request isn’t
available or isn’t ready when you arrive. If you’re sailing with a large
group, make sure that you get a plan of the boat’s sleeping arrange-
ments. (Pick the biggest cabin for yourself!)

 The charter fee and contract: When you book a charter, expect to pay a
deposit (usually 25 percent of the total) upon booking and have the
remainder due 60 days before the charter start date. Your charter contract
should include a refund schedule, but expect to forfeit the entire charter
fee if you cancel within 60 days. The average price of a weeklong bareboat
charter (40-foot, or 12-meter, boat) is about $3,000. Prices vary greatly with
the season, size and type of boat, and location. And sometimes the smaller
charter companies offer more competitive rates — so shopping around
can pay. You can also purchase travel insurance to cover you if you must
cancel. You may also be asked to prove your sailing ability; often a resume
is helpful — or any certifications you’ve earned at a sailing school.
 Liability coverage: Each charter company has its own policy for damage
and loss. The typical policy is either a large, refundable deposit ($500 to
$2,000) or a small, nonrefundable premium ($25 to $40 per day).
 Maintenance and repair services: Keep in mind that a newer boat is
probably less likely to have broken equipment, although the top charter
companies have fantastic maintenance programs. Ask about the turn-
around time between charters; the boat needs to be at the charter base
for at least a day for routine maintenance.
 On-site support: Make sure that you know how to contact the charter
company through VHF or SSB radio (see Chapter 7) and that you know
its policy if you need assistance. Cellular phones are becoming more
common in popular charter regions. Most charter companies have sup-
port bases throughout the cruising area.

Chapter 17: Chartering: Changes in Latitude

 Boat provisioning: The charter company can organize partial or full pro-
visioning, saving you a day of shopping in unfamiliar markets. When you
get aboard, stow the food yourself so that you know where to find it.
Unless cooking in a sailboat-sized galley is your idea of a great vacation,
we advise you to keep your menus as simple as possible and plan on
eating out a bit as part of your vacation budget.
 Additional gear: You need a rowing dinghy (often an inflatable equipped
with a small outboard engine) to get to shore, and the charter company
should include one.
Throughout this book, we use the word dinghy to describe any sailboat
with a centerboard. Here we refer to a rowing dinghy, which can be
called dinghies, too; they just aren’t rigged with sails (although some can
be). So for the rest of this chapter on chartering, when we say dinghy,
we mean a rowing dinghy (that may have an outboard). Okay?
The charter company can organize snorkeling and other watersports
gear — even kayaks and sailboards. We usually bring our own masks and
snorkels and rent the fins. Make sure to put any specific gear requests in
writing and get a confirmed response. Charter companies should also
provide navigation equipment, including nautical charts and a VHF radio.
Having a hibachi grill mounted on the stern pulpit is the best way to
cook the fish you catch!
 Items to pack: Pack lightly — the charter company can advise you on
expected weather conditions. Space is at a premium, especially if you’re
chartering with several people. See Chapter 3 for tips on clothing needs
afloat. And in the tropics, cover up lily-white skin no matter how warm
the weather.
Checking out your craft
After you arrive at the front door of the charter company, ready to go cruis-
ing, you need to do the following:
340
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 
Don’t forget to pack a good book
We both love a good sea story, and we urge you
to check out our list of our favorite sailing books
in Chapter 16. JJ can’t be pinned down on the
subject of her favorite sailing author; she blows
with the wind. But Peter’s favorite sailing author
is Joseph Conrad. The descriptions of storms
and adventures at sea in his short stories and
novels are true classics. And although your first
introduction to them may be in an English class,
if you take the time, you can find many gems in
his bibliography.

 Inspect your boat. Make sure that all the required equipment is on
board. Check all lines for signs of wear, and make sure that all the
winches and blocks are functioning properly. Go over all the equipment
with the charter-company representative. Make sure you point out any-
thing you notice is wrong during the inspection. Ideally the charter com-
pany should fix any broken equipment before you leave.
 Attend boat orientation. The charter-company representative should give
you a thorough orientation to the boat. Make sure that you understand
how the onboard systems work, such as the sails, safety equipment, sun
shades, ventilation system, windlass system for anchoring, storage,
galley facilities, navigation gear and radios, marine heads and showers,
and, of course, use of the rowing (or outboard-powered) dinghy.
 Get to know the cruising area. Always take the time to sit down with a
company representative to look over the nautical chart of the area. You
want to be briefed on the local attractions and any hazards. Be sure to
ask for help in planning your ideal itinerary as well as backup plans in
case of adverse weather.
 Prove your ability to handle the boat. An old joke in the charter indus-
try goes like this:
Q: What qualifications do you need to be able to bareboat charter?
A: A check that doesn’t bounce.
We hope that the charter company has you prove your ability. Certainly,
certification to a recognized standard, such as the American Sailing
Association or U.S. Sailing Bareboat Charter Standard, is helpful. If, after
a checkout, the charter company doesn’t think that you possess the
ability to handle the boat, it has the right to refuse your business or give
you the opportunity to pay for a captain to come along.
Cruising with a skipper
If you need pampering on your vacation, chartering a fully crewed yacht 
is for you. You can help with the sailing as much or as little as you like.
Delicious meals appear at the proper times, and you can just relax and enjoy
the sights. Of course, your next bank statement will reflect this first-class
treatment. We’ve seen some truly awesome boats, 80 feet (24 meters) in
length and longer, in the islands on fully crewed charters. The crew can even
rig up the sailboard for you!
One in-between option is to have a partially crewed trip in which you hire a
skipper for the first half of the trip. Then, if the charter company feels that
you’re qualified, you can go the rest of the way bareboat. The Moorings offers
a “friendly-skipper” service for free for a half day on your first day out to help
you refresh your skills.
341
Chapter 17: Chartering: Changes in Latitude

Both The Moorings and Sunsail also offer a variety of “learn-to-sail” vacations
where you can earn certification while cruising the British Virgin Islands. The
introductory courses combine a few nights ashore with a week of cruising
with an instructor.
Identifying Important Chartering Skills
What skills do you need to operate a charter boat safely for a week? You
should have at least one full sailing season of experience skippering a similar-
sized boat in similar conditions. Fortunately, most charter destinations are in
fairly protected waters. (Who wants to vacation in the middle of the ocean?)
If you’ve mastered sailing on your lake aboard a two-person dinghy but have
never been aboard a bigger keelboat, you need to take some lessons and
build more experience.
Not everyone on the crew needs to be an expert sailor, but at least two sailors
need to be competent. You need to possess and be able to demonstrate the
following ten pieces of knowledge and skills before chartering a boat:
 Experience as a skipper on a live-aboard cruise of at least 48 hours.
 Ability to anchor and pick up a mooring safely, using the equipment 
provided.
 Ability to obtain and interpret the weather forecast.
 Ability to perform coastal piloting by using a nautical chart and compass.
 Understanding of basic safety procedures for the type of boat you’re
aboard — including man-overboard rescue routines.
 Ability to handle the boat under power in confined areas. (But always
make some practice maneuvers in open water first.)
 Understanding of onboard systems, including navigation equipment,
engine, marine head, and galley facilities. Most cruising boats have a
roller furler for the jib, a lazy jack system for storing the mainsail, and a
windlass to help with the anchor — make sure you understand these
systems too.
 Understanding of etiquette when anchoring in a crowded harbor.
 Ability to instruct and advise nonsailors and less-expert sailors on the
operation of the boat and basic safety considerations.
 Ability to sail. Just tell the charter company that you’ve read Sailing For
Dummies!
342
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Using Your Dinghy
Figure 17-2 shows an idyllic cruising scene. A key component to that fun is
the dinghy tied behind the cruising boat. Because your dinghy is often your
ticket to freedom on a cruise, you want to make sure that it doesn’t float
away. The following tips can make life afloat with a dinghy more enjoyable:
 Bring a paddle. An outboard engine may power your dinghy, but make
sure that you have some alternate means of propulsion — just in case!
 Stop that banging. Assuming your dinghy is a rubber inflatable, you can
tie it so the engine can’t hit the hull of your sailboat. But kayaks and
other water toys have a habit of banging against the hull as the wind
shifts in the anchorage at 3 a.m., so you may want to pull them up on the
dinghy at night.
 Tie your dinghy securely. Whether you’re towing your dinghy behind
the boat or leaving it high and dry on an idyllic beach while you do
some exploring, make sure that you tie it up well. Use a bowline knot, or
tie your dinghy around a horn cleat, as Chapter 19 shows. Inspect the
dinghy’s bow line for chafe; if it looks shaky, tie on a new one. On a
beach, always secure the dinghy (with an anchor in the sand or a bow
line tied to a sturdy object) above the highest possible level that the tide
and waves can reach, and keep an eye on it.

Chapter 17: Chartering: Changes in Latitude

 Tow your dinghy safely. If you decide to pull your dinghy behind you
from place to place, then take everything out of the boat (oars, fuel tank,
engine, swim fins, and so on) before you get under way. Check with the
charter company for its recommendations of dinghy towing. The same
principles of safe towing that we cover in Chapter 7 apply. When backing
or maneuvering the sailboat in close quarters, bring the dinghy close
alongside, and have one person watch it so that you don’t run over the
tow rope.
 Watch out for surf. Don’t try landing your dinghy on a beach with break-
ers; even small waves can tip your boat. If you must beach your dinghy
in waves, try to make your timing so that a wave washes you far up the
beach. Then quickly climb out and grab the bow line so that it doesn’t
drift back. Always land bow first and depart bow out. Avoid standing in
the water between the dinghy and the beach because a wave can throw
the boat right at you.
Eyeing Popular Cruising Grounds
So you think you’re interested in taking a charter. This section provides a list of
the ten nicest places we know to go cruising and some close runner-ups. All
places have great charter companies, but you can also sail your own boat there.
 Australia’s Whitsunday Passage: Located in the Coral Sea between
Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef, the Whitsunday Passage features
great diving and a steady southeast trade wind, especially August to
October.
 The Bahamas: The Bahamas are popular and easily accessible from the
United States. Some of the most beautiful islands are the Abacos (the
Family Islands), Eleuthera, and the Exumas. They have plenty of shallow
waters, so be attentive to the visual clues of depth and the reading on
your depth sounder as well as being a vigilant pilot, as we describe in
Chapter 9. Many safe anchorages in close proximity to each other pro-
vide for variety and carefree planning when you’re afloat.
 Caribbean Islands: Without doubt, the Caribbean is the No. 1 charter
destination in the world. Especially popular are the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands. They feature great year-round weather (although you may
want to avoid hurricane season). These islands are especially good for
novice charterers because of the predictable winds, deep waters, numer-
ous protected sailing areas, easy navigation, and plenty of beautiful and
safe anchorages.
 Florida Keys: With easy access from the mainland United States to the
Sunshine State, the Florida Keys feature warm, shoal waters.
344
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

 Great Lakes: Get out of the nearby big cities, and you’d swear that
you’re in the middle of nowhere when you’re on the Great Lakes. Did you
know that the water of northern Lake Huron is crystal clear?
 Mediterranean: Spain, France, Italy, Croatia, Greece, and Turkey all have
plenty of beautiful cruising grounds and lessons in ancient history.
 Mexico: The waters of the Gulf of California inside Baja, Mexico, can be
magical.
 New Zealand’s Bay of Islands: Summer — February and March (remem-
ber the southern hemisphere) — is the peak season for the Bay of Islands.
 Pacific Northwest: Uncrowded, scenic anchorages are the highlight in
the Pacific Northwest. The protected waters of Puget Sound are great
cruising grounds, but they have strong currents, big tidal ranges, and
cold water.
 South Pacific: Tahiti, Tonga, and Fiji have big charter fleets. Watch out
for cyclones in the South Pacific in the summer months.
Here are a few of the runner-ups (fitting the world in a list of ten is hard):
 California: We love the Channel Islands of California — a pristine cruis-
ing ground just offshore from Southern California.
 Chesapeake Bay: Peter loves the softshell crabs of Chesapeake Bay. Just
make sure that you have a shallow-draft boat to get to all the neat little
harbors on the Eastern Shore.
 Maine: Maine has beautiful cruising grounds, but they’re not for begin-
ners. Prime sailing months are July to early September, but the weather
is fickle. Secluded anchorages are plentiful. Difficulties for cruising
include large tidal ranges, strong currents, possibility of fog, and the
rocky coastline.
 Scandinavia: Can you say “fjords”? You may after sailing these waters —
plus you have some amazing archipelagos to explore.
345
Chapter 17: Chartering: Changes in Latitude
Extreme chartering
Ever dream of rounding Cape Horn or dodging
icebergs while sailing to Antarctica? You can on
a crewed charter with expert sailors! A few out-
fits specialize in expedition-style charters. Peter
cruised the Beagle Channel and the region
around Cape Horn aboard Skip Novak’s 55-foot
(17-meter) sloop Pelagic. Pelagic Expeditions
(www.pelagic.co.uk) now has two boats
in its fleet and offers a variety of “expedition
charters” to remote, high-latitude locations in
both hemispheres. Southern California’s Orange
Coast College School of Sailing Seamanship
offers adventure charter opportunities closer 
to home (www.occsailing.com/pages/
eagle.html).

The high season is the time of the year when a destination is most popular.
Weatherwise, high season is the best time to go to a particular place, but be
aware that some areas get pretty crowded during this peak season — plus
the high season is more expensive. Table 17-1 outlines the high seasons of ten
of the most popular charter destinations.

I
n this chapter, we introduce you to our favorite kind of sailboats — 
sailboards. An offshoot of surfing, sailboarding developed in the United
States in the late 1960s and now is popular all around the world. Sailboarding
(which some also call windsurfing, a trademark of a brand of boards and sails)
requires just what the name says — a board and a sail. Plus, you can go sail-
boarding just about anywhere. We’ve even tried it in a swimming pool!
One of the great features of sailing is that after you master the basics on one
boat, you can transfer those skills to other boats with relative ease. But if
you’ve spent any time trying to sailboard, you may think that these boats are
the exception to the “If you can sail one boat, you can sail any boat” rule. Not
really. Sailboards are a little more difficult to sail than other boats because
they require more balance and coordination, but we show you exercises that
you can do to get comfortable standing on the board. And take it from us —
sailboarding is definitely worth the effort.

Windswimming, Anyone?
Just as with any other type of sailing, we recommend finding a certified
instructor to show you the basics of sailboarding. Most sailboard schools
have special equipment, such as “simulator” boards, that let you get the feel
on shore before heading out and getting wet. And you’re definitely going to
get wet. This phase of your sailboarding career isn’t called windswimming for
nothing!
A sailboarding vacation may be the best way for you to start. Great vacation
packages are available in sailboarding hot spots around the world — hot
being the operative word. We recommend that you take a good look at these
possibilities, because the warmer the water, the easier it is to enjoy and get
through the windswimming phase.
The sailing skills that you develop with other sailboats — being attuned to
and feeling the wind direction — are just as important with sailboards. The
safety rules that we review in Chapters 3 and 7 still apply; make sure that you
check your equipment, that you have sufficiently warm clothing (such as a
wetsuit and/or a life jacket), and that you aren’t heading out in conditions
that are too windy or rough. A qualified instructor can make sure that your
experience is as safe (and fun) as possible.
Even if you can manage a sailboard in light winds, if you want to take up high-
wind sailboarding, we again recommend taking instruction from a qualified
instructor. A number of schools and resorts can give you great instruction
and expose you to the myriad equipment options you face when you want to
get into this end of the sport. Careful, though — high-wind sailboarding is
very addictive!

that allow them to get launched out of the water
and fly in the air (not just the kites but the sailors
too). Kiteboarding is the latest extreme craze. To
kiteboard, you just need a kite with lots of
strings so you can fly it, a harness to help you
hold on, a board slightly bigger than a snow-
board or wakeboard, and a helmet for safety. All
the equipment is easy to carry to the beach. But
definitely make sure you get proper instruction
from a qualified instructor. New equipment is
making the sport safer and easier, but kite-
boarding is still a bit dangerous — what goes
up must come down (and possibly get dragged
down the beach). Your sailing skills can help
smooth out that learning curve a bit — espe-
cially your ability to sense the wind’s strength
and direction and to read the waves and water.
So put on that helmet, call your local kiteboard-
ing shop, sign up for some lessons, and get
ready to fly.

Parts are parts
The parts of a sailboard are similar to the parts of any sailboat, as Figure 18-1
shows. Your arms become the mainsheet; your body becomes the standing
rigging. The biggest difference is that a sailboard doesn’t have a rudder —
you steer a sailboard with the sail and your body weight. The following is a
rundown on a sailboard’s distinctive parts and features:
 Boom (or wishboom): Wishbone-shaped tubes attached to the mast and
sail that allow you to adjust the sail’s trim.
 Camber inducers: Fittings in the sail’s luff into which the battens sit.
(See Chapter 4 to review the parts of a sail.) Their shape creates a three-
dimensional, winglike shape for the sail. Camber inducers are used pri-
marily on high-performance (not beginner) sails.
 Footstraps: Straps to secure your feet that are normally used in high-
speed and wave sailing. Footstraps aren’t on all boards.
 Gooseneck: A fitting (often a clamp) attaching the boom to the mast.
 Harness: A harness you wear with a hook that can connect temporarily
to the harness lines, thereby taking the load off your arms.
 Harness lines: Rope loops on either side of the boom into which you
hook your harness. Harness lines aren’t on all boards.

Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

 Mast base: A fitting at the bottom of the mast that connects to the uni-
versal joint.
 Mast sleeve: The sailcloth tube along the luff of the sail into which you
insert the mast when getting ready to sail.
 Skeg: A fixed fin providing directional stability under the back of the
board.
 Towing eye: A loop near the front of the board for attaching a tow line.
 Universal joint: A fitting connecting the rig to the board, enabling you to
rotate the rig in any direction.
 Uphaul line: A line attached to the gooseneck to help pull the rig out of
the water.
The ideal setup
The ideal conditions for beginning sailboarders include flat (no waves), warm
water and a steady, light-to-moderate breeze parallel to the shore. Because
beginners start out with sailing on a reach (for a review of the points of sail,
see Chapter 5), this orientation makes going out and coming in easy. If the
breeze is blowing offshore (away from the land), you have to sail close-hauled
back to shore, a difficult point of sail for a beginner. When the breeze is blow-
ing onshore, trying to sail away is difficult and frustrating. Sailboarding in too
much wind is nearly impossible for beginners.
Fortunately, I began sailboarding in Florida, where the water is nice and
warm. I started sailboarding right at the beginning of the windsurfer craze, so
no one was really an expert yet. My friends and I sailed out of a marina with
lots of boats and very tight confines — not the ideal place to begin. We sat for
hours, watching each other struggling through the shifting winds and falling
every few seconds — to the glee of the crowd on the dock. Today, you can
avoid much of that embarrassment thanks to the much-improved teaching
techniques that have evolved over the years.
Bigger is better — at least 
at the beginning
Start on the biggest, floatiest board you can find — it provides the most
stable platform. Make sure that the deck has sufficient roughness to prevent
you from slipping off. If not, try wearing rubber slippers (available at marine
stores) to increase your traction. The big sailboard manufacturers offer
350
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

trainer boards especially aimed at the newbie — trainer boards really help
facilitate the learning process.
After you master the basics, you’ll probably be tempted to try out different
boards, including the much less buoyant, high-wind boards that are so popu-
lar around the world. The difference in maneuverability and performance will
amaze you.
One reason why you may want to take your first few lessons at a school is
that its boards are ideal for beginners. And you may want to delay your first
purchase until you can handle a slightly more advanced board.
Your instructor probably recommends an undersized “training sail”, because
beginners fall a lot when learning. A smaller sail is easier to pull back out of the
water and lets you get the feel of how to balance without being overpowering.
Rigging the Board
The great part about sailboards is that they’re easy to rig. The more high-
performance sails, with their long battens and camber inducers, can be a bit
trickier to rig, but a beginner’s sail should have few (if any) battens. Rigging
your sailboard (especially the sail) is similar in many ways to rigging any sail-
boat (see Chapter 4). Like some dinghies, you don’t have a halyard to hoist;
the sail’s luff sleeve simply slides down onto the mast. The trickiest part can
be securing the boom to the mast so that the boom is at a comfortable height
(roughly chest height), so have your instructor help out.
Making a Not-So-Dry Run
Have we mentioned that you’re going to get wet and look a little foolish when
you first begin sailboarding? You can minimize your embarrassment (a little)
by getting used to the board and the sail before you put them together.
Getting used to the board
After you assemble the right equipment, leave the sail on shore for a while
and familiarize yourself with the board. You can try some of the following
drills to get comfortable on your board:
351
Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

 Practice lying on your stomach and paddling the board. Try paddling
in a circle.
 Stand up and work on your balance. Keep your knees bent and your
hands out to the side — just like a tightrope walker.
 Move your feet out to each side of the board, and practice rocking the
board from side to side. Try to keep your balance!
 Walk toward the front of the board, practice turning around, walk
toward the stern, and turn again. You can’t do this drill on a small,
high-wind board — the board is too small and unstable.
When you feel comfortable on the board, put it back on the beach near your
starting point, and get the sail.
Getting used to the sail
Balance is the first tricky part about sailboarding. The second tricky part is
that a sailboard doesn’t have a rudder. You steer the boat with the sail and
your weight.
Your instructor may have access to a simulator. Use it if possible. Otherwise
you can get a feel for the dynamics of handling the sail as follows:
1. Stand the sail up on shore, bracing the mast base with your foot.
2. Stand to windward of the sail and hold onto the mast at or near the
gooseneck.
The sail luffs like a flag with the wind.
Note: A fully-battened sail doesn’t flap like a normal sail.
3. Face directly downwind, with your back to the wind and the sail
pointing downwind away from you.
Get comfortable in this luffing, or “safety,” position, as Figure 18-2
shows, because you’re in this position quite a bit at first.
4. Try tilting the sail to your left and then to your right.
When you’re on the water, you turn the board by tilting the sail in this
manner.
352
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Getting Your Feet (And the 
Rest of You) Wet
After you attach your rig to the board, here are the steps to getting going:
1. Put the board in deep enough water that the centerboard can be
down all the way.
Position the board so the wind blows across one side.
2. Put the sail downwind of the board so that the mast and board form a T.
3. Kneel on the board at the mast base and grab the uphaul line.
4. Stand up and start pulling the sail out of the water with the uphaul.
Use your full body weight. Bend your knees — don’t strain your back.
Figure 18-2:
Standing on
the shore
with the sail
in a luffing
position.
353
Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

5. When the sail is all the way out of the water, hold the mast in the luff-
ing position like you practiced on land.
Your feet straddle the mast.
6. Holding the mast with your back hand (the hand that’s farthest back
when you get under way), cross your forward hand over and grab the
boom about a foot behind the mast.
7. After grabbing the boom, bend this arm and bring the rig across your
body, as Figure 18-3 shows.
The sail is still luffing.
8. Take slow baby steps around to the side of the board as you grab the
boom with your back hand about 3 feet behind where your forward
hand is.
Keep both hands on the boom. Your back arm is the mainsheet. Your
front arm is like the shrouds (wires supporting the mast). If you pull in
your back arm and keep your front arm steady, you trim in the sail and
start to move forward.
9. Pull in your back arm so that you’re facing the middle of the sail —
perfectly positioned to balance the force of the wind.
You’re sailing on a reach!

354
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

Lean your body back away from the rig as much as you need to keep your
balance. You can control the trim of the sail by the position of your arms. To
trim in, pull in your back hand. To ease out, either push out your back hand
or pull in your front hand. To stop, just return to the luffing or “safety” posi-
tion by first releasing your back hand from the boom and then bringing it for-
ward to hold onto the mast or uphaul line.
Of course, by now you’re great at the other method for stopping — falling in.
If you fall, make sure that you always swim back to the board right away, or
else it may drift off. Use the board as your swim platform to take a break.
Whether you’re in the Caribbean on a learn-to-sailboard vacation, taking
lessons at a local lake, or at your friend’s beach house on the shore, keep
these points in mind as you practice your sailboarding skills:
 When you fall in, try to fall backward on your butt instead of jumping
feet first. Otherwise, if the water is shallow, you can twist your ankle.
 As you come back to the surface after a fall, put your hands up above
your head so that you don’t hit your head on the sail or board.
 If you find that you’re constantly sliding off the board, ask the school or
rental shop for a different board. The board’s original nonskid surface
may be worn off. We’ve also seen boards that have suntan lotion all over
them and are as slippery as a seal. For traction, some people swear by
those special rubber booties.
Steering the Board
After you master getting moving, you quickly want to know how to turn.
Many beginners get the first part right, but then they keep going and going
because they don’t know how to turn around and get back, or they’re so fear-
ful of attempting a tack that they get too far from shore. (If this scenario hap-
pens to you, hope that your instructor has a motorboat!)
Practice the leaning techniques you tried on land. With the rig in the safety
position, lean it to the right, and the board swivels left — and vice versa (see
Figure 18-4). Keep practicing until you can turn the board 360 degrees. As the
board turns, take baby steps around the mast base to keep your back facing
the wind direction.
355
Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

When you pull in the sail and are moving forward, you can steer by leaning
the rig forward or backward while keeping the sail sheeted in with your back
hand, as Figure 18-5 shows. The key is to stay in balance and tilt the rig with-
out changing the angle of the sail to the wind too much.

Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

As you experiment with turning, you quickly discover that sailing upwind and
reaching are very similar, but sailing on a run is a real challenge. Therefore,
the first maneuver a sailboarder tries is a tack rather than a jibe.
Tacking
To tack means to maneuver through the no-sail zone so that the wind is blowing
on the opposite side of the boat. Here are the steps to tacking on a sailboard:
1. Tilt the rig aft (toward the back) and trim the sail to turn the board
toward the wind.
2. When the board is almost pointed directly toward the wind in the no-
sail zone, step your forward foot around the front of the mast so that
you end up straddling the mast with your back to the wind.
3. With the sail luffing, continue making baby steps to the other side of
the board as you lean the rig sideways to get the board pointed on a
reaching course on the new tack.
The wind is coming over the new side of the board.
4. As the board bears away, cross your new forward hand over to grab
the boom — as we describe in the “Getting Your Feet (And the Rest of
You) Wet” section, earlier in this chapter — and pull the sheet in with
your back hand.
Take your final baby steps so you’re facing the sail standing on the new
windward side, and off you go!
Going straight on a reach or close-hauled is relatively easy to master because
all the forces are pretty balanced, and you can make fine adjustments with
your arms. Balancing only becomes a challenge when the board slows down
(such as in a maneuver) and when you’re sailing downwind. Just like in so
many other sports, the best advice is bend your knees!
Sailing downwind
When you go downwind, all that nice stability and control goes out the
window. With the wind straight behind, you must stand facing the front of the
board, counteracting the forward pull of the sail. Any movement to the right
or left really rocks the board — this point of sail really tests your balance.
To begin downwind sailing, follow these steps:
1. Start by sailing on a reach.
The wind is blowing across the board.
357
Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

2. To bear off on a broader reach, tilt the mast forward to turn the
board down (away from the wind), constantly moving your feet and
rotating your body to counteract the sail’s force.
As the wind comes from more dead behind, the force on the sail may feel
more powerful.
3. To counteract the force on the sail, bring both hands closer to you 
or take a step or two back — thereby tipping the top of the sail 
backward — until you feel like you can control the sail.
If you get hit with a huge puff, you can always release your back hand
(the hand closest to the clew, or back corner, of the sail) and luff the sail
to keep from being pulled forward into the water.
Bend your knees to maintain your balance.
Jibing
When sailing downwind, you may want to try a jibe. A jibe is a maneuver
where you change tacks by turning away from the wind. Jibing on a short,
high-performance sailboard can be downright thrilling — like carving a turn
on a slalom water ski or on a snowboard. But on a big longboard (trainer sail-
board), tacking around and then bearing off is much easier than jibing
because the big board is tough to turn.
The easiest way to jibe is simply to unload the sail and revert to the safety
position, holding onto the mast near the gooseneck. Then tilt the rig and walk
around to the “new” windward side to turn the boat until it’s pointed on a
comfortable reaching course. Then get going again in the standard fashion.
A cool, exhibition-style jibe maneuver is possible on a longboard. Here’s how
to pull off one of these maneuvers:
1. As you sail downwind, step aft (back) to sink the back of the board.
If your board isn’t big and floaty, you can stay forward to keep the board
from getting too unstable.
2. Rotate the sail (keeping it full of wind) so that the board turns onto
the new jibe.
3. Quickly release your back hand (closest to the clew) and pull in your
front hand.
4. As the clew of the sail goes winging away from you, cross your old
back hand over and grab the boom about a foot back on the new
windward side.
The momentum of the clew rotating around enables you to grab the
boom with your new back hand.
358
Part IV: Sailing Away for a Year and a Day 

5. Pull the boom in and go!
All the while you’re doing this maneuver, you’re keeping your balance
precariously on the board. If you don’t fall in the water, be ecstatic!
Sailing straight downwind in anything but light air is a pain on a longboard.
So if I need to get to a downwind destination, I sail on a broad reach across
the wind, jibing (or tacking) each time I want to zig or zag back the other way.
If conditions are windy, this approach is a really fun way of getting downwind,
because your board creates its own wind and flies across the water.
Keeping in balance
Anticipating wind shifts helps you keep the sails trimmed properly — which
means you stay drier, too. Here are some tips for staying balanced when the
wind changes:
 As a puff of wind hits, lean your weight out more. Be ready to let out
your back hand and pull in your front hand to ease the sail slightly so
that you stay balanced and don’t get pulled over.
 If you anticipate the end of the puff, bring your weight to the center as
the wind dies away.
 If the wind dies suddenly, bend your knees and get your torso over the
top of the board quickly to avoid falling backward into the water.
If you’ve ever been skiing, you know how easily you can pick out the begin-
ning skiers coming down the hill. The same principle applies with sailboard-
ing; just look for the guy with his butt sticking way out. If you want to look
cool, tilt your hips forward and bend your knees!
Getting Back to Shore 
in Case of Problems
If you have a problem such as a dying breeze or broken equipment, you can
always paddle the board and the rig back to shore. The ability to rescue your-
self is crucial to sailboarding safety.
While you’re sailing, make sure to keep an eye on your distance away from
shore. Try a tack or a jibe after a few minutes so you don’t sail too far from
shore.
359
Chapter 18: Sailing Sailboards

If you must paddle a short distance, try laying the rig over the stern of the
board so that it’s partially out of the water, lie or kneel on the board, and
start using those arms. The problem with this technique is that the sail is like
a big brake dragging in the water. If conditions are windy, or if you have a
long distance to go, de-rigging the sail may help. Release the outhaul, roll up
the sail along the mast (or if the sail is fully battened, slide it off the mast and
then roll it up), fold the boom up against the mast, and start paddling, as
Figure 18-6 shows.

Peter’s ten favorite sailboarding spots
I love sailing shorter boards that perform 
best when the wind is up. So my favorite spots
are known for reliably strong winds (except
Skaneateles Lake which has other attractions).
1. Perth, Western Australia
2. British Virgin Islands
3. San Francisco Bay, California
4. Columbia River Gorge, Oregon
5. North Shore, Oahu, and Maui, Hawaii
6. Canary Islands
7. Seal Beach, California
8. Cape Hatteras, North Carolina
9. Skaneateles Lake, New York
10. Anywhere the water is warm and the wind
is more than 18 knots
Europe also has a number of hot sailboarding
spots; I just haven’t had a chance to check them
out yet!

If you need to signal for help, kneel or stand on the board and wave your
arms. In an emergency, always stay with your board — it’s your primary
source of flotation. Staying out of the water on the board keeps you much
warmer. If you try to paddle back to shore, but the extra windage (drag) of
your rig components make forward motion difficult, you can always sacrifice
the rig to Poseidon to save the board — and yourself.

drives to the lake. Luckily, the cartoon ends happily (they

Chapter 19
Ten Nautical Knots and 
How to Tie Them
In This Chapter
 Securing the most common types of knots
 Mastering the more advanced knots
No one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell-rope from
the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which
the cord was fastened to the chair.
— Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
Yes, you can tie the knot on a boat, but we’re not talking about marriage.
This chapter reviews the basic knots on a sailboat and shows you how
to tie them. On most boats, you can find a bowline, a figure-eight knot, a
square knot, and maybe a couple of half hitches somewhere.
Knowing how to tie these knots (especially the bowline and the round turn
with two half hitches) and using them properly can save you a great deal of
time and make your life afloat safer. With a 5-foot length of rope, you can
practice these knots at home and master them quickly. Master them, and
you’re well on your way to becoming an “able seaman.”
Overhand Knot
An overhand knot is the basic knot that you use to begin tying your shoes
and, as you see in the following sections, is the first step of many sailing
knots. If your mother only lets you wear shoes with Velcro straps, and you
can’t make an overhand knot, see Figure 19-1 on how to begin tying your
shoes. (You may want to buy Getting Dressed For Dummies as soon as it
comes out.)

Figure-Eight Knot
The figure-eight knot is a lightweight, but it’s fun to tie and can save you a
great deal of aggravation. While you’re sitting in the boat, let your eyes follow
the sheets or halyards from start to finish. The “finish” is probably at some
sort of cleat. On smaller boats, all these running rigging lines should have
figure-eight knots, as Figure 19-2 shows, at the very end to prevent the line
from getting pulled out of its rigged path (that is, through pulleys and so on).
Trust us — when a line “sucks” out of its normal path, it’s a hassle, especially
if the rope is a halyard!
Note that with the additional loads on bigger boat lines, you don’t want to tie
knots in the ends of spinnaker sheets because you may need to let the line
run through the block in an emergency.
Figure 19-2:
The figure-
eight knot.
Figure 19-1:
The basic
overhand
knot.
366
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The reason to use a figure-eight knot instead of a simple overhand knot is
that the figure-eight is easier to untie after it has been under load (a charac-
teristic of most good sailing knots), whereas an overhand knot can get very
tight. Plus, the figure-eight is a bulkier knot and is thus less likely to slip
through a cleat or block.
To tie a figure-eight knot, follow these steps:
1. Make a loop in the end of the line.
2. Pass the end of the line under, back over, and up through the loop so
that it looks like a figure eight.
Bowline Knot
The bowline (pronounced bow-lynn, so it rhymes with rollin’) is a beautiful
knot. You can call it the essential sailing knot: It’s quick to tie, easy to untie,
and a practical knot all around the boat. It forms a loop (of any size you want)
at the end of a line, and sailors commonly use it to tie jib sheets onto the sail.
On many dinghies, you use a bowline knot to attach the halyard to the sail.
The easiest way to remember how to tie a bowline is the kid’s way — by
imagining a bunny rabbit coming out of his hole, as Figure 19-3 shows.
Follow these steps for tying a bowline:
1. Make the rabbit hole, as Figure 19-3 shows.
2. Make the rabbit come up through the hole and around the back of
the tree.
Figure 19-3:
A bowline.
367
Chapter 19: Ten Nautical Knots and How to Tie Them

3. Make the rabbit go back down the hole.
4. Pull the three ends to tighten.
To untie a bowline, bend back the part formed when the rabbit goes “around
the back of the tree,” and the knot loosens up nicely.
Square Knot
The square knot is a knot that you may have practiced in Scouts. It’s just two
overhand knots with the first tied right over left, and the second tied left over
right (or vice versa), as Figure 19-4 shows. (A granny knot is when you tie
both overhand knots the same way.)
Tie a square knot like this:
1. Tie an overhand knot (the first knot you tie when tying your shoes).
2. On the second overhand knot, tie it the opposite way.
If you put the left piece over the right on the first knot, put the right
piece over the left for the second knot.
You’ve tied it right if the ends of the lines are parallel to the standing (work-
ing) part of the lines — so that it looks like two symmetrical loops. Use a
square knot to tie two lengths of the same type of line together.
Figure 19-4:
The square
knot.
368
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Cleat Knot
Use the cleat knot in Figure 19-5 any time you find a horn or t-cleat, such as
when you’re tying off halyards and tying your boat to most docks. Make sure
you loop your line one full turn around the base of the horn cleat before tying
this knot. If your dock line is a very small diameter, it can slip off the horn
cleat, so in that case, you may want to tie a bowline through the center of the
horn cleat instead.
Two Half Hitches
Two half hitches knot is also called the double half hitch. It’s really two over-
hand knots tied around the standing part of a line. This quickie knot has
many temporary uses, including tying a tow line around your mast in a
dinghy to get a quick tow. Tying two half hitches is a quick way to temporar-
ily cleat off a line on a winch or other fixed object. If the rope is going to be
under load, add the extra friction of a wrap or two around the object before
tying the hitches (hence the term round turn and two half hitches). That way,
you can untie it easily later, even if the rope has been stressed to its limit.
Check out Figure 19-6 to tie a round turn and two half hitches.
Here are the steps to tying a round turn and two half hitches:
1. Make two turns around the mast or object so that you can comfortably
hold the line in your hand.
2. Tie two half hitches (two overhand knots) around the standing part of
the line.
Figure 19-5:
Securing a
line around
a horn cleat.
369
Chapter 19: Ten Nautical Knots and How to Tie Them

The round turn and two half hitches is, in my opinion, the most underrated of
knots. It’s the most practical knot there is; it’s just so darn useful all over the
boat. And the thing I like best is how easy this knot is to tie, even under pres-
sure situations when you need to make that knot fast now!
Clove Hitch
You must tie the clove hitch, a close cousin to two half hitches, around some-
thing, such as a lifeline or piling. It’s a quick knot for tying on fenders, tying a
dock line to a piling, and anything you use temporarily. With the first loop,
you can hold the line in place, and then you can tie the second loop to be
secure. Unlike a round turn with two half hitches, the clove hitch can get very
difficult to undo under pressure. See the step-by-step details of tying a clove
hitch in Figure 19-7.
Figure 19-7:
The clove
hitch.
Figure 19-6:
Round turn
and two half
hitches.
370
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Follow these steps to tie a clove hitch:
1. Make a loop around the pole or object.
2. Make a second loop by crossing over the first loop.
3. Put the tail under the second loop.
4. Pull both ends to tighten.
Fisherman’s Bend
The fisherman’s bend isn’t a common knot because other knots, such as the
bowline and the round turn with two half hitches, can also do its job. This
knot is less likely than a bowline to loosen but is more difficult to untie,
making it a good knot to use when you want to leave the knot in place for a
long time. You often use the fisherman’s bend to attach an anchor to its line,
so it’s sometimes called an anchor bend. Check out the how-to in Figure 19-8.
Here are the steps to tying this knot:
1. Make two loops around the shackle or anchor chain.
2. Pass the end of the line through both loops and tighten.
3. Add another hitch for safety.

Rolling Hitch
This is an all-around great knot, one that can really impress your fans because
you can use it to get out of trouble. You use the rolling hitch for tying one line
to another. It grips so tightly that you can use it to take the load off the end of
the other line in an emergency (such as a winch override; see Chapter 5). If
you look closely at Figure 19-9, you see that a rolling hitch is a clove hitch
with another twist or two.
Tie a rolling hitch like this:
1. Make two loops around the rope or other item to be attached.
2. Put the tail over the two loops, and then make a third loop.
3. Put the tail under the third loop and tighten.
Always wrap the first two loops of a rolling hitch on the side closer to your
intended pulling direction. For example, if you’re tying a line to a halyard
coming out of the mast, wrap around the bottom first, because you intend to
pull down. The third loop (the “hitch” that turns it into a real knot) wraps
above the first two.

hitch.

Trucker’s Hitch
We used to show the kids at different sailing clinics a great old Warren Miller
video that shows a 15-foot dinghy flying off a car and sliding down a ditch.
Somehow, the music and Warren Miller’s dry humor make the scene hilari-
ous, but having your boat fly off your car isn’t funny. Tying your boat on the
car or trailer well is a rare art, but the trucker’s hitch (a combination purchase
system and knot all wrapped up in one) makes the task much easier. For the
how-to, see Figure 19-10.
Follow these steps to tie a trucker’s hitch:
1. Make a loop a few feet from the end of the line.
2. Tie an overhand knot with the loop and tighten, keeping the loop big
enough to pass a line through.
3. Pass the end of the line around your roof rack or trailer bar.
4. Put the line up through the trucker’s hitch loop and pull.
You’ve made a quick 2:1 (two-to-one) purchase (mechanical advantage)
so you can pull that line tight twice as easily. You can tie off the line with
two half hitches.
Whenever I packed up my Olympic dinghy for a drive up the coast or out to
Florida, Peter went around the boat and retied every line before I left. His
favorite knot for cinching a boat onto a roof rack (or onto a trailer) is the
trucker’s hitch.

Ten Questions to Ask Yourself
When Buying a Sailboat
In This Chapter
 Evaluating what a sailboat has to offer
 Looking at value
There was a great difference in boats, of course. For a long time I was on a
boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in. But
of course this was at rare intervals.
— Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi
W
e hope by the time you read this chapter that you’re hooked on sail-
ing. In fact, we hope you’re so hooked that you catch yourself day-
dreaming of having your own sailboat. You can “window shop” for your
dream boat in the pages of sailing magazines, at boat shows, on the Internet,
and even just by walking around the local marina.
Shopping for a sailboat can be intimidating, especially if you’re new to sailing.
However, if you decide to take that next big step and buy your own sailboat,
this chapter can help you gather the information and better prepare yourself
to make that big decision.
What Do You Plan to Use the Boat For?
Are you planning to go for day sails or on extended cruising trips? Do you want
to start racing? Do you need to entertain (and impress) the boss? Are you into
athletic exercise, or are you more of a couch potato–type sailor? What other
types of activities do you plan? If you’re planning on doing some overnight
trips, you may want a windlass, a mechanical device to assist pulling up the
anchor as described in Chapter 10, for easy anchoring. An avid diver may want

a large swim step. Do you envision fun outings with the whole family? If so,
make sure your family has input in the selection process. Do you plan to make
this new boat your “home away from home”? (Sadly, most sailboats spend
most of their time tied up at the dock.) If so, then you may require lots of
headroom down below. Are you interested in racing? Then check what fleets
are popular in your area. The answers to these types of questions can help
you narrow your search.
Who Do You Want to Bring Along?
You can comfortably sail many dinghies and even some keelboats (if rigged
with an autopilot and roller-furling sails) single-handed. Some high-performance
dinghies and large keelboats require a full contingent of expert crew and may
not have room for extra bodies.
Lining up a number of expert sailors for each and every sail can become a
hassle, so be realistic about how big a boat you need. Make a list of your
potential crew members and make sure that you don’t need each and every
one of them before you can leave the dock. (This fact may surprise you, but
some of your crew may have other commitments from time to time.)
Where Do You Plan to Use the Boat?
Are you going to sail in protected waters, such as a small lake, or out on the
open ocean? What are the heaviest winds and seas you expect during your sail-
ing? Different boats work better for different locations. In Southern California,
for example, a popular cruising destination is Catalina Island, a 20-mile (32-
kilometer) sail from Los Angeles. Because sailing to Catalina requires an open-
ocean crossing, you need a bigger, better-equipped boat to sail there than if
you plan to stay inside the confines of the Long Beach breakwater.
Sailors in Florida need lots of portholes (windows) for air flow and a nice big
bimini cover to protect them from the sun. Sailors in Maine or the Pacific
Northwest need a boat with a pilot house (high cabin with lots of windows
surrounding the steering wheel) for protection from the rain and cold. If you
live near a lake, you may want a boat that’s easy to store on a trailer. Many
manufacturers have boats with retractable keels for just that purpose.
A related question is “How deep is the water where you plan to use the
boat?” Some manufacturers sell two models of popular cruising boats — a
“shoal-draft” model, which is popular in shallow areas like Florida and the
Bahamas, and a standard, full-draft model, which may be more appropriate
on the West Coast.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Where Should You Buy a Boat?
If you’re shopping for a used dinghy or smaller catamaran or keelboat (shorter
than 25 feet, or 8 meters), your best bet may be keeping an eye on classified
ads in the local papers (especially the boating newspapers) and watching the
bulletin boards at marinas and yacht clubs. Most often this sort of transaction
is handled privately. For a larger, more expensive used keelboat, you probably
want to employ the services of a broker, as we describe in this section. If you’re
interested in a smaller (shorter than 25-foot, or 8-meter) racing class of boat,
talk to local owners of the same class to find out your options.
Boat shows are a great place to buy a new boat — especially the bigger,
(longer than 25 feet, or 8 meters) more expensive models — because you
have lots of boats to choose from, and dealers and manufacturers often offer
deep discounts. But whether you want new or used, do your homework
before going to the boat show. Your first step is finding a broker. A good boat
broker should ask you many of the same questions we do and will have lots
of the answers you need to make the right purchase. They get their fee from
the seller and, kind of like real-estate brokers, they can help in all aspects of
the purchase, including finding dock/storage space and financing.
Most new boats are sold by dealers, similar to cars, but some manufacturers
sell their products directly to consumers. Some dealerships even offer per-
sonalized instruction in sailing or operating your new boat.
If you like doing research online, check out SAIL Magazine’s Sailboat Buyer’s
Guide (www.sailbuyersguide.com) or search the Web for brokers in your
area or specific manufacturers. You can also find a wide variety of boats at
some popular Web sites, such as www.boats.com and www.usedboats.com.
Where Do You Plan to Keep the Boat?
Is a place available to launch your boat so that you can keep it on a trailer or
put it on your car top and store it at home? If you’re planning to store your
boat on a trailer in your yard, have you checked with your spouse, neighbors,
and/or neighborhood covenants first? Do you have access to a slip (in-water
dockside storage) at a marina or yacht club? The slip fees at your local marina
may cost as much as loan payments on your new boat (and finding a slip can
be hard — but boat brokers have good connections here, too).
377
Chapter 20: Ten Questions to Ask Yourself When Buying a Sailboat

How Much Can You Afford to Spend?
Prices for a new 12-foot (4-meter) dinghy begin around $3,000, while prices
for a new 25-foot (8-meter) keelboat begin in the neighborhood of $22,500.
But of course, you can spend many times that price. When you’re calculating
how much you can afford, don’t forget to put together a realistic yearly oper-
ating budget, including storage fees, maintenance costs, and some replace-
ment gear. For a dinghy, that jib sheet rope you need to replace may be just
a few dollars, but the same part on a keelboat can set you back $50 or more.
In northern climes, you have to haul and store boats on land during the
winter. Even in warmer areas, you should have a yearly haul-out for most
boats for maintenance. Call the local boatyard to get a quote. As a rough
guide, remember that the bigger and more active the boat, the more it costs
to run and maintain.
378
Part V: The Part of Tens 
For the love of classic boats
Ever since I built a 13-foot (4-meter) Blue Jay
wooden dinghy for my sister (during college,
when I should have been studying), I’ve been
enamored with wooden boats. We visit Mystic
Seaport (the Museum of America and the Sea;
check out www.mysticseaport.org) and
its fascinating exhibits whenever we get back
to Connecticut. And I serve on the advisory
board of the International Yacht Restoration
School in Newport, Rhode Island (www.iyrs.
org). Recently my friend Dennis Conner under-
took a full restoration of the 1926 Q boat, Cotton
Blossom (see the following figure). The finished
boat is simply incredible — and is certainly the
most beautiful wooden boat sailing on the West
Coast. Dennis even races it occasionally!

Are You Getting a Good Value?
Buying a boat with good resale value may be important, especially when
you’re buying your first boat. One consideration is the taste in your local
market. For example, a classic wooden boat has much more value on the East
Coast than in the Caribbean. Try to think ahead: As you gain experience, your
taste in boats may change, so a rash purchase today may not suit you tomor-
row. New boats are like new cars — they can lose a great deal of their value
as soon as you drive them off the lot. And make sure that you have a com-
plete inventory of what comes with the boat so you know whether that cool
depth sounder is still there when you have the pink slip.
Is the Boat Seaworthy?
An Internet search may link you to articles and/or forums on the merits of
various types of boats. But the best way to find out whether a specific boat is
seaworthy is to pay to have a marine survey, which includes (for a larger
keelboat) a haul-out for inspection. A marine surveyor can give you a com-
prehensive report on the boat’s seaworthiness and is also useful for insuring
your new boat. Usually, a marine survey is more applicable to the sale of a
keelboat. With a dinghy, you may have to rely on your skills of observation.
A sea trial (the nautical equivalent of a test drive) can also help you assess
the boat’s seaworthiness and whether you like the way it handles various
conditions — hopefully you get to test a boat on a windy day. And ask the
seller for the maintenance history on the boat.
What Equipment Do You Need?
The local conditions and your sailing plans affect what you need. Check out
other boats at the local marina or ask local sailors for gear recommendations.
For example, in San Diego, where the wind rarely exceeds 12 knots, you may
never use a small, heavy-air jib, but if you’re sailing in San Francisco Bay,
such a jib is the sail you use a lot of the time. Wait to add equipment (except
essential safety equipment) until you sail the boat several times. However, if
you know you’re planning to sail a larger sailboat short-handed, purchasing
an autopilot and a roller furler is a smart investment right away.
379
Chapter 20: Ten Questions to Ask Yourself When Buying a Sailboat

What Kind of Boat Do You Want?
As you search for your perfect boat, you hear names such as sportboat or
blue-water cruiser. These names are loose categories that can help you type-
cast a particular boat. For example, the following list includes some of the
common categories for keelboats:
 Sportboat: A sportboat is a fast keelboat (usually 20 to 30 feet, or 6 to 9
meters) with hardly any amenities, such as a galley (kitchen) or private
head (cabin with toilet) down below. But in a sportboat, you get from
point A to point B fast (and probably a bit wet).
 Day sailer: A day sailer is about the same size as a sportboat and also
doesn’t have many creature comforts below but is cheaper (and slower)
than a sportboat.
 Blue-water cruiser: A blue-water, or long-distance, cruiser is a sturdy,
well-built keelboat (usually longer than 40 feet, or 12 meters) that’s
meant to make long passages, say from New York to the Azores.
 Cruisers: And then you have all kinds of cruisers in between: from budget
cruisers that won’t break any speed records or have as many appoint-
ments but satisfy that urge to get out on the water, to floating gadget
palaces with watermakers, flat-screen televisions, and all the toys.
Admit it — you look at other cars on the highway to find one that you like.
The same is true with boats. One day, you may see the perfect boat go sailing
past, but how do you know what it is? Many boats have an insignia on their
mainsail that indicates their type, as Figure 20-1 shows. Sometimes the
insignia is a class logo, and other times it’s a manufacturer’s logo. Some use
stylized artwork (like the Laser in Figure 20-1) that you have to know to rec-
ognize, while some logos provide an obvious clue to the boat’s type (the
Sunfish dinghy, for example, uses a picture of a sunfish as its logo).

The Appendixes

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you can find a handy glossary with all the
important sailing terms that we use in this book. You
don’t need to memorize these terms to go sailing, but you
may want to review them from time to time, especially if
you can’t remember the difference between a jib and a
jibe. In Appendix B, we show you some basic first aid in
case someone on your boat gets sick. Of course, if some-
one is really sick, call 911 and contact the Coast Guard on
Channel 16 of your marine radio. The final appendix
shows you how a boat works — the basic physics of get-
ting your boat to sail. Some people think sailing is like 
driving — you don’t really need to know how that engine
works to drive your car, and you don’t really have to know
how a sailboat works to sail. But we think a better analogy
is buying Driving For Dummies back when the first cars
were invented. Back then, knowing why you turned that
starter crank and why you needed a clutch was important
when you couldn’t just call someone on your cell phone if
your Model T stalled.

Appendix B
First Aid Afloat
Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.
— William Shakespeare
T
his appendix is meant to give you an idea of what the most common
afflictions aboard a boat are and the basic remedies for those ills.
Obviously, anything can happen when you’re out to sea, so you may need to
help with a wide variety of medical situations. This appendix gives you some
presailing advice and then covers the most common illnesses on board a
boat, including hypothermia, seasickness, and sunburn.
If anyone on your boat requires prompt medical attention, call the Coast
Guard (Channel 16 on your VHF radio). Or your cellphone may work if you’re
sailing close to shore, so call 911. For more on using your VHF, see Chapter 7.
Preparing for Sailing
Make sure that you and everyone you’re planning to take sailing knows how
to swim. See Chapter 16 for tips on how to choose a swimming instructor for
your children. We also strongly recommend that you know cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), regardless of whether you plan to go sailing. Being on
the water increases the amount of time that emergency personnel needs to
get to you, and CPR is the best way to keep someone alive while rescue per-
sonnel are on their way. Teaching CPR is beyond the scope of this book, but
your local Red Cross can teach you the technique in only a few hours.
Be sure to ask your CPR instructor to show you how to use the technique
with the drowning-victim recovery position. In addition, smart sailors should
strongly consider taking a first-aid course and sailing with a first-aid manual
and first-aid kit.

Pick a first-aid manual
Even if you’re not planning an extended cruise, investing in a good first-aid
manual for your boat makes sense. Ask your doctor and check your local
bookstore or marine store for a good first-aid manual. Here are some manuals
that we recommend:
 AMA Handbook — First Aid
 Advanced First Aid Afloat, by Peter Eastman, M.D.
 Wilderness & Travel Medicine, by Eric A. Weiss, M.D.
 First Aid at Sea, by Douglas Justins and Colin Berry
 Sailing and Yachting First Aid, by Drs. Bergan and Guzzetta (find at
www.store.ussailing.org under cruising education books)
Pack a first-aid kit
On any trip, even a short one, take along plenty of food and water, a good
first-aid book (see the list of recommended books in the preceding section),
and a well-stocked first-aid kit if your boat has sufficient storage space. Ice is
important to bring, and we also recommend those fancy products that
become cold compresses when you squeeze or shake them.
Stow a first-aid kit in a dry, watertight compartment with a list of contents on
the box for easy reference. Before you sail, familiarize yourself with your first-
aid manual for how to use them to deal with burns, cuts, bleeding, and head
injuries. If anyone requires medication for an ongoing condition, make sure
that medicine is on board. If it needs to be kept cool, place it in a small cooler. 
Recovering from Hypothermia
We talk about the danger of losing body heat in Chapter 7. The loss of body
heat is called hypothermia or exposure. Your body temperature cools down 25
times faster in cold water than in the same temperature of air, so hypothermia
is most common in people who have fallen overboard, but it can also affect
people on deck when they’re sailing in cold weather, especially at night. The
symptoms of hypothermia start with loss of circulation to the extremities —
fingers and toes. As your head gets cold, your mental and physical responses
slow down, and you may have difficulty speaking and be disoriented. Shivering
is the body’s attempt to warm up, and hypothermia is more dangerous when
shivering stops. 
392
Part VI: Appendixes 

393
Appendix B: First Aid Afloat
You must warm hypothermia victims gradually, and you need to warm their
core area (around the heart) first. If the victim is unconscious without a
pulse, contact the Coast Guard and use CPR until medical help arrives.
1. Remove the victim’s wet clothing.
2. Place the victim in a sleeping bag with warm blankets.
3. Have a crew member (or two) climb in the sleeping bag to warm the
victim with body heat.
Remember to warm the core (chest area) first. This method of warming
up the victim may sound kinky, but it can be a lifesaver.
4. Give the victim warm (not hot) drinks and high-energy food.
Warm soup and warm sugary drinks are better than caffeine or alcohol
so the victim can generate his or her own internal heat.
Staving Off Seasickness
Having that seasick feeling can ruin an otherwise great day afloat. To minimize
your chances of feeling nauseous, we suggest you try the following actions:
 Avoid alcohol (or a hangover). That “woozy” feeling isn’t fun at sea.
 Avoid rich, greasy foods. Choose the bagel instead of the eggs benedict
at breakfast.
 Focus on the horizon. Distractions such as steering the boat or helping
with a job on deck can help you feel better, too.
 Keep some solid food in your stomach at all times. Crackers or bread
are good choices.
 Sip small amounts of fizzy drinks. Maybe just an old wives’ tale, but
ginger ale and clear soft drinks work best for us.
 Stay on deck. Stay in the fresh air, away from exhaust fumes (if your
boat has an engine).
If you throw up, try to do so off the leeward side of the boat, downwind of
everyone (including yourself).
Several medicines can help combat seasickness, but you must take most before
the symptoms start. Of course, like just about any other medication, don’t take
any of these medicines if you’re pregnant without consulting with your doctor.
Even if you aren’t pregnant, your doctor may be able to recommend a good
remedy. You must take over-the-counter seasickness pills, such as Dramamine,
an hour before sailing; however, they can cause drowsiness and a dry mouth.
Ask your doctor about a patch that administers Scopolamine, a prescription
motion-sickness drug.

Keep an eye on anyone who is feeling seasick. Seasickness can make you
weak, disoriented, and extremely sleepy — a danger when on deck. Help
people who are seasick to a comfortable spot in the fresh air. If they’re just
feeling a little queasy, try letting them steer as a distraction. If you aren’t feel-
ing well, don’t be ashamed; almost all sailors feel queasy at some point.
Steering Clear of Sunburn
The effects of being out in the sun all day, combined with the sun’s rays
reflected off the water, make sailors prime candidates for sunburn. The fol-
lowing tips can help you avoid having a painful sunburn at the end of the day:
 Put sunscreen on before you leave the dock.
 Reapply sunscreen several times during the day — especially in wet
conditions.
 Always use a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least
15. We try to always carry a stick of sunscreen in our pockets so that we
can frequently reapply sunscreen to our noses, lips, and ears.
 Always wear a hat and sunglasses.
 If you’re fair skinned or are sailing in a tropical locale, wear a long-
sleeved, lightweight cotton shirt (one with a collar to help protect
your neck) and long pants. Guarding your skin this way makes your trip
much more enjoyable. You’ll be amazed at how tan you get even when
you’re covered up all day.
We have a number of friends who’ve battled skin cancer, and it’s not a pleas-
ant fight. So please be careful out in the sun. If you do have severe sunburn,
using aloe vera products helps soothe the skin. Drink plenty of cool fluids
and try to wear loose-fitting cotton clothes to help your skin heal.
Defeating Dehydration
Dehydration and heat exhaustion are two of the most dangerous illnesses for
sailors, because the body rejects the cure, which is to get cool and drink
plenty of fluids. With severe dehydration, your body rejects any fluid intake
by throwing up, making you further dehydrated. Severe dehydration can
result in staying in a hospital hooked up to an IV to rehydrate. So try to drink
as much fluid as you can while you’re on the water.
In very hot conditions, you can get dehydrated even when you feel like
you’ve been consuming fluids all day. One way to tell whether you’re getting
dehydrated is by how much you have to urinate. If you haven’t had to use the
head (marine toilet) all day, you need to drink a lot more water.

The Physics of Sailing:
Understanding How 
Sailboats Work
The perfection of a yacht’s beauty is that nothing should be there for only
beauty’s sake.
— John MacGregor
A
merica’s Cup teams and the fastest distance racers spend millions of
dollars trying to quantify what makes a sailboat move — and move fast
(or at least faster than the competition). So know right from the beginning
that studying boat movement is a highly complex problem that deals with
fluids of vastly different densities (water and air — yes, air is a fluid too), 
and your boat operates on the confused interface between those two fluids.
Although you don’t really have to know how a sailboat works to enjoy sailing,
finding out how it works can be fascinating — so feel free to dive into this
appendix.
Looking at the Basic Forces
Figuring out the best wing shape for supersonic flying at 60,000 feet is much
easier than figuring out the best hull, keel, and sail shape for a racing sailboat
because, with aircraft, you need to consider only the plane’s interaction with
very thin air. However, to understand the physical principles involved with
sailboat movement, you have to understand the following two basic forces
that propel a sailboat:
 Motion of air over the sails
 Water flow over a centerboard or keel
The next two sections briefly explain each of these forces in greater depth.

Air moving over the sails
When a sailboat is sailing with the wind behind it, the sails act like a para-
chute out in front of the boat as the boat moves with the wind. But the
dynamics get more interesting when a crew wants the sailboat to sail at an
angle to the wind.
First, look at how a simple airfoil (wing) generates lift. Put your hand out the
window of a moving car with your palm facing forward, and the wind simply
pushes it backward. But when you slowly rotate your hand into the wind,
twisting your thumb downward, you can feel your hand begin to lift up (in
addition to being pushed back). This lift is due to the motion of the air that
passes above and below your hand. As you begin to twist your hand, the air
traveling over the top of your hand speeds up relative to the air streaming
under the bottom, as Figure C-1 shows.
The fast-moving air creates low pressure, so by twisting your hand, you gen-
erate a low-pressure area over the top of your hand. The difference in pres-
sure (caused by your hand “wing” and its slight angle of attack to the airflow,
that is, slightly angled in the wind) results in an upward force that lifts your
hand as well as a slight sideways force pushing your hand backwards.
Understanding these upward and sideways forces is crucial to understanding
lift and why a sailboat moves forward. The same basic principle of wings and
air flow works for birds, planes, and sailboats.
So what happens when a boat sails upwind? First, look at the sail. When you pull
in the mainsheet and fill the sail with wind, the sail creates a wing shape. That
wing has an angle of attack to the wind flow. Just like your hand out the car
window (or any airfoil at an angle of attack to the flow), the air over the back
side of the sail goes faster than the air on the front side. The resulting difference
in pressure creates lift — a force pushing the boat sideways and forward.

396
Part VI: Appendixes 

Water passing over the underwater wing
If the airflow over the sail was the only force involved, sailboats would slip
sideways when they tried to sail close-hauled. A sailboat, however, has wings
above and below the water. When a close-hauled sailboat trims in its sails
and begins to move through the water, slipping sideways, the underwater
wings (centerboard or keel and rudder) also create a force that, when com-
bined with the sail force, moves a sailboat forward. Here’s how: Like any
other wing, the water passing over the back side of the centerboard or keel
goes faster than the water passing over the front side. The resulting differ-
ence in water pressure this flow of water creates pulls the boat forward and
sideways — but in the opposite “sideways” direction of the sail force. The
opposing sideways forces cancel each other out, as Figure C-2 shows, and the
forward forces remain.
Together, the forces of the wind on the sails and the water on the center-
board or keel (and to a much lesser extent on the rudder) enable the boat to
sail at a close angle to the wind. You can’t sail straight into the wind, or the
sails would flap like a flag, and you wouldn’t generate any lifting forces on the
sails. Most modern sailboats can sail within 45 degrees (or closer) to the
wind direction, a remarkable feat when you consider that the ships in which
explorers such as Magellan sailed the world were so inefficient they could
barely sail within 90 degrees to the wind.
Balancing the Forces
A main design factor for naval architects (boat designers) is to get the sail
forces (also called the Center of Effort or CE) and the underwater forces (the
Center of Lateral Resistance or CLR) in balance.

Appendix C: The Physics of Sailing

A sailboard (see Chapter 18) provides a simple example of how these forces
interact. First consider the sail when properly trimmed to the correct angle to
the wind flow. The CE is the single spot that describes the sum of all the forces
from the wind flow up and down the sail — roughly halfway up and one-third
of the way back from the front of a sail. Below the water is the CLR — the pivot
point of the sailboard (or sailboat) when it turns, as Figure C-3 shows.
When a sailboard is in the groove (sailing in a straight line), the CE and CLR
forces are in balance and the boat tracks straight. But tip the rig back some
while keeping it trimmed at the same angle to the wind, and the balance is
disturbed. The sail’s CE is now behind the board’s pivot point as Figure C-3
shows, and the boat turns up toward the wind. Conversely, by tipping the
mast top forward, the CE moves in front of the board’s pivot point, and the
board turns down, away from the wind.
Obviously you can’t just tip your mast back and forth on a dinghy or keelboat
while underway. But you can change the boat’s balance with your heel angle
and sail trim. When I was training for the Olympics, my favorite drill was
practicing steering the boat without the rudder to improve my feel for the
boat’s heel and balance. Instead of using our rudder, my teammate and I
would steer by

Part VI: Appendixes 

 Moving our weight: By heeling the boat one way or the other, you
change the balance of the boat and make it turn. When you (and your
crew) heel the boat to windward (toward the wind), the boat turns to lee-
ward (away from the wind), and vice versa. In order to go in a straight
line, the forces above and below the water must balance not only fore
and aft, but also sideways. So when you heel the boat one way or the
other, you disturb that balance.
 Adjusting the sails: You can also change the balance of a sailboat with a
jib and main by filling one sail and luffing the other. When you trim the
jib and let out the main, the boat turns leeward. Overtrimming the main
and luffing the jib causes the boat to turn windward.
The technique of moving your weight to steer doesn’t work as well on a heavy
keelboat, because compared to the weight of the boat, your weight is too
light to substantially change the heel of the boat.
In Chapter 11, we discuss weather helm — the tendency of most boats to
want to turn into the wind when close-hauled or reaching. Weather helm
results when the CE and CLR forces are slightly out of balance. A slight bit of
weather helm is natural and can help you steer “in the groove” by providing a
bit of feel. And there are some complicated reasons why it’s fast too. But if
your tiller or wheel pulls too hard when you’re trying to steer straight, you
can reduce weather helm by easing the main (which moves the CE forward).
Minimizing Drag
Another force affecting your boat’s performance is drag. Sailboat racers
spend lots of time polishing their hull and underwater foils so the boat slips
through the water faster. But because you can’t sail in a vacuum, a certain
amount of drag is inevitable; in fact, turning the rudder creates drag.
Every time you turn your rudder to steer, you slightly slow down the boat.
You see, the rudder is like a huge sea-brake. Imagine the water flow past the
rudder when it’s straight. Now turn the rudder hard over, and all that flow
becomes disturbed and very turbulent. The net result is that the boat turns,
but it also slows down.
On a smaller boat, such as a dinghy or sailboard, you can also greatly affect
the boat’s drag by moving your weight too far forward or aft in the boat. In
general, position your weight over the center of lateral resistance, which is
usually even or just aft of the boat’s centerboard or rudder. (See Chapter 11
for more go-fast tips.)

Appendix C: The Physics of Sailing

Testing the Waters
The description in this appendix of how a sailboat works is, necessarily, sim-
plified. You see, even today, scientists are still fine-tuning the theory of the
physics involved in making a sailboat sail upwind. The fact that the physics
involved are so complex can make sailing even more fun. You, the sailor, can
be a test pilot, fiddling with the various adjustments of sail shape and the boat’s
angle to the wind to squeeze even more performance out of your craft . . . or
you can just go sailing. In the end, sailing is all about balancing out the forces
of the wind and water on the boat and its sails. By adjusting the sails, your
crew weight, the tune of your mast, and the boat’s angle of heel, you can find
that magic balance that results in the best speed.

Less drag by canting the keel
Canting Ballast Twin Foil (CBTF) technology
(www.cbtftechnology.com) is now stan-
dard equipment on some of the fastest mono-
hulls in the world. CBTF features an innovative
underbody consisting of two foils (fore and aft)
that are twin rudders to do the steering and a
central ballast strut that cants, or swings side
to side to move the lead bulb where it’s more
effective. With a push of a button, the bulb can
do the hiking for you.
In the late ’90s, Peter skippered the first true
CBTF design, the 40-foot (12-meter) Red Hornet
in races in different parts of the United States.
The boat was an immediate success and was
quite a “giant killer” as Peter and his crew often
beat boats that were nearly twice as big. Right
before producing the second edition of this
book, Peter navigated the 86-foot CBTF design
Morning Glory to a record-setting run in the
Transpac Race (Los Angeles to Honolulu).
